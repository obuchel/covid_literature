1284,1284,1284,Development of a risk assessment tool for contact tracing people after contact with infectious patients while travelling by bus or other public ground transport: a Delphi consensus approach,15.05964,2.1097295,2013-10-24,"BACKGROUND: Tracing persons who have been in contact with an infectious patient may be very effective in preventing the spread of communicable diseases. However, criteria to decide when to conduct contact tracing are not well established. We have investigated the available evidence for contact tracing with a focus on public ground transport aiming to give guidance in what situations contact tracing should be considered. METHODS: Relevant infectious diseases suitable for contact tracing in ground transport and a set of disease-specific epidemiological criteria were defined through literature search and structured multistep expert consultations. We developed continuous scales for each criterion to be rated for its relevance to contact tracing in ground transport. We used the Delphi method with an international expert panel to position the values of criteria on the respective scales. RESULTS: The study led to the development of the ‘Contact Tracing-Risk Assessment Profile’ (CT-RAP), a decision-making instrument, taking into account pathogen-specific as well as situation-specific criteria. This report describes the methodology of this instrument and presents two examples of ready-to-use CT-RAP for tuberculosis and for meningococcal disease in public ground transport. DISCUSSION: The systematic and transparent use of the CT-RAP for tuberculosis and meningococcal disease is likely to facilitate reasonable, efficient and user-friendly decisions with respect to contact tracing. New CT-RAPs for additional pathogens and different settings such as schools and kindergartens are being planned.","Mohr, Oliver; Hermes, Julia; Schink, Susanne B; Askar, Mona; Menucci, Daniel; Swaan, Corien; Goetsch, Udo; Monk, Philip; Eckmanns, Tim; Poggensee, Gabriele; Krause, Gérard",BMJ Open,283,1

Reinvention can enhance (or impede) the likelihood of an IS innovation’s acceptance and further diffusion. This paper reports on a case study of BioSense, an interorganizational system that was designed as an early detection tool for bio-terror attacks and subsequently modified to better serve this need as well as to operate as a public health system for pinpointing geographic clusters of dangerous/acute disease outbreaks. By examining the interplay among the political and organizational dynamics and technical properties of the BioSense system, we shed light on processes affecting reinvention in an interorganizational context. We discuss our findings in light of theories of the diffusion and reinvention of innovations. We use Rogers’ (1995) list of factors supporting reinvention to structure the discussion of the fidelity and uniformity of the innovation within the processes it supports in adopting health services organizations.","Fedorowicz, Jane; Gogan, Janis L.",Inf Syst Front,283,1

However, the link between circulating levels of ACE2-Ang-(1–7)-Mas axis and coronary atherosclerosis in humans is not determined. The object of present study was to investigate the association of circulating levels of ACE2, Ang-(1–7) and Ang-(1–9) with coronary heart disease (CHD) defined by coronary angiography (CAG). 275 patients who were referred to CAG for the evaluation of suspected CHD were enrolled and divided into two groups: CHD group (diameter narrowing ≥ 50%, n = 218) and non-CHD group (diameter narrowing < 50%, n = 57). Circulating ACE2, Ang-(1–7) and Ang-(1–9) levels were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In females, circulating ACE2 levels were higher in the CHD group than in the non-CHD group (5617.16 ± 5206.67 vs. 3124.06 ± 3005.36 pg/ml, P = 0.009), and subgroup analysis showed the significant differences in ACE2 levels between the two groups only exist in patients with multi-vessel lesions (P = 0.009). In multivariate logistic regression, compared with the people in the lowest ACE2 quartile, those in the highest quartile had an OR of 4.33 (95% CI 1.20–15.61) for the CHD (P for trend = 0.025), the OR was 5.94 (95% CI 1.08–32.51) for the third ACE2 quartile and 9.58 (95% CI 1.61–56.95) for the highest ACE2 quartile after adjusting for potential confounders (P for trend = 0.022). However, circulating Ang-(1–7) and Ang-(1–9) levels had no significant differences between the two groups. In males, there were no significant differences in the levels of ACE2-Ang-(1–7)-MAS axis between two groups. Together, circulating ACE2 levels, but not Ang-(1–7) and Ang-(1–9) levels, significantly increased in female CHD group when compared with non-CHD group, increased ACE2 was independently associated with CHD in female and in patients with multi-vessel lesions even after adjusting for the confounding factors, indicating that ACE2 may participate as a compensatory mechanism in CHD.

For community-based studies, home-based specimen collection by parents could be a resource-saving alternative to collection by healthcare workers (HCWs). In this study, we compared parent and HCW groups for their likelihood to collect specimens and the timeliness and quality of such collection. METHODS: In this unblinded randomized controlled trial, parents from Brisbane, Australia, were taught to identify new ARI episodes in their children aged <2 years. When their child had a new ARI, parents either collected a nasal swab from the child (P group) or contacted an HCW who visited to obtain a nasopharyngeal swab (HCW group). We compared the likelihood and timeliness of specimen collection and respiratory pathogen detection. A nested diagnostic study compared paired specimen collections from children in the HCW group. RESULTS: Included were 76 incident ARI episodes from 31 children and 102 episodes from 33 children in the P and HCW groups, respectively. The proportions of ARIs for which a specimen was collected were similar (P group, 69.7%; HCW group, 72.5%; P = .77), and pathogens were detected in 93.8% and 77.5% of the specimens, respectively (P = .03). The period between ARI onset and specimen collection was shorter in the P group than in the HCW group (mean difference, 1.9 days [95% confidence interval, 0.7–3.0 days]; P < .001). For the 69 paired specimens, viral loads were lower in the parent-collected swabs (mean cycle threshold difference, 4.5 [95% confidence interval, 3.1–5.9]; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Parents and HCWs obtained samples in similar proportions of ARI episodes, but the parents collected the samples fewer days after ARI onset and with a resulting higher likelihood of pathogen identification. This method can be used in population-based epidemiological studies of ARI as a resource-saving alternative.

It can be used as an alternative cure for patients that do not respond to traditional treatments. In the study, we tested the mechanical properties of PCL fibers, and the hemp oil spreading together with the release in time measured on skin model and human skin. The PCL membranes are suitable material as patches or bandages, characterized by good mechanical properties and high permeability. Importantly, PCL patches showed release of hemp oil up to 55% within 6 h, increasing also the skin moisture up to 25%. Our results confirmed that electrospun PCL patches are great material as oil carriers indicating a high potential to be used as skin patches for AD skin treatment.","Metwally, Sara; Ura, Daniel P.; Krysiak, Zuzanna J.; Kaniuk, Łukasz; Szewczyk, Piotr K.; Stachewicz, Urszula",Membranes (Basel),283,1

In particular, the fast-moving field of nanomedicine takes advantage of features of NPs for the detection and treatment of different types of cancer, fibrosis, inflammation, arthritis as well as neurodegenerative and gastrointestinal diseases. To this end, a detailed understanding of the NP uptake mechanisms by cells and intracellular localization is essential for safe and efficient therapeutic applications. In the first part of this review, we describe the several endocytic pathways involved in the internalization of NPs and we discuss the impact of the physicochemical properties of NPs on this process. In addition, the potential challenges of using various inhibitors, endocytic markers and genetic approaches to study endocytosis are addressed along with the principal (semi) quantification methods of NP uptake. The second part focuses on synthetic and bio-inspired substances, which can stimulate or decrease the cellular uptake of NPs. This approach could be interesting in nanomedicine where a high accumulation of drugs in the target cells is desirable and clearance by immune cells is to be avoided. This review contributes to an improved understanding of NP endocytic pathways and reveals potential substances, which can be used in nanomedicine to improve NP delivery.","Sousa de Almeida, Mauro; Susnik, Eva; Drasler, Barbara; Taladriz-Blanco, Patricia; Petri-Fink, Alke; Rothen-Rutishauser, Barbara",,283,1

These health system constraints determine the ‘feasibility’ of interventions and hence impact. However, considering them within mathematical models places additional demands on model structure and relies on data availability. This review aims to provide an overview of published methods for considering constraints in mathematical models of infectious disease. We systematically searched the literature to identify studies employing dynamic transmission models to assess interventions in any infectious disease and geographical area that included non-financial constraints to implementation. Information was extracted on the types of constraints considered and how these were identified and characterised, as well as on the model structures and techniques for incorporating the constraints. A total of 36 studies were retained for analysis. While most dynamic transmission models identified were deterministic compartmental models, stochastic models and agent-based simulations were also successfully used for assessing the effects of non-financial constraints on priority setting. Studies aimed to assess reductions in intervention coverage (and programme costs) as a result of constraints preventing successful roll-out and scale-up, and/or to calculate costs and resources needed to relax these constraints and achieve desired coverage levels. We identified three approaches for incorporating constraints within the analyses: (i) estimation within the disease transmission model; (ii) linking disease transmission and health system models; (iii) optimising under constraints (other than the budget). The review highlighted the viability of expanding model-based priority setting to consider health system constraints. We show strengths and limitations in current approaches to identify and quantify locally-relevant constraints, ranging from simple assumptions to structured elicitation and operational models. Overall, there is a clear need for transparency in the way feasibility is defined as a decision criteria for its systematic operationalisation within models.","Bozzani, Fiammetta M.; Vassall, Anna; Gomez, Gabriela B.",Epidemics,283,27

Objectives: To determine the etiology of bronchiolitis in northern Portugal. Methods: It was a prospective multicenter study on the etiology of bronchiolitis during the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) season (November-April). Children ≤24 months of age admitted for a first wheezing episode were included. Nasopharyngeal specimens were analyzed by an indirect immunofluorescentantibody assay (IFA) for RSV, adenovirus (HAdV), parainfluenza (PIV) 1-3 and influenza (IV)Aand B and by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or reverse transcription-PCR for the same viruses and for human metapneumovirus (hMPV), bocavirus (HBoV), rhinovirus (HRV), coronaviruses (229/E; NL63; OC43; HKU1) and enterovirus. Results: During this period, 253 children were included, 249 IFA analyses and 207 PCRs were performed. IFA detected RSV in 58.1%; PCR increased it to 66.7%. IFA detected HAdV in 3.2%, PCR 10.0%. PCR detected IV A in 5; IV B in 2; PIV 1 in 6, PIV 2 in 4 and PIV 3 in 11 cases. HBoV, as single agent in 2 cases, and HRV were positive in 8 samples and hMPV in 11. With this virus panel, 19.7% remained without etiology. Conclusions: The most frequent agent was RSV, followed by HAdV. PCR can be cost-effective and more accurate than IFA, which is crucial for HAdV that may be associated with significant mortality (IFA alone did not detect 2/3 of the cases).","Rodrigues, H; Silva, N; Ferreira, C; Carvalho, F; Ramalho, H; Branca, F; Antunes, H",Pediatr Res,283,1

In this chapter, a model coupling the classic SIR disease transmission model with an imitation dynamics process is introduced which accounts for the diffusion of different behaviors in the population as a response to the epidemic threat. A detailed analysis of the model identifies the main determinants leading to remarkable alterations in infection dynamics in both risk perception and diffusion of human behavioral patterns.

The first class of this category refers to DAMPs, which are passively released from necrotic cells, and includes the most prominent subclasses of high mobility group box I and heat shock proteins. Further subclasses of DAMPs that are passively released from necrotic cells include S100 proteins, nucleic acids, histones, pro-forms of interleukin-1-family members, mitochondria-derived N-formylated peptides, F-actin, and heme. A particular subclass of these passively released DAMPs are molecules, which indirectly activate the inflammasome, including adenosine-5′-triphosphate, monosodium urate crystals, cholesterol crystals, some lipolytic species, and beta-amyloid. All these passively released DAMPs are characterized by their capability to promote necroinflammatory responses. The second class of this Category I refers to molecules, which are exposed on the surface of stressed cells. They include the subclass of phagocytosis-facilitating molecules such as calreticulin, as well as the subclass of MHC-I-related molecules such as MHC-I-related molecule A and B. These DAMPs are capable of inducing the activation of innate lymphoid cells and unconventional T cells. One of these DAMPs, the major histocompatibility complex I-related molecule A, is shown to act as a bona fide transplantation antigen.

In molecular evolution one of the remarkable observations has been the uniformity of the molecular clock. An analysis of proteins derived from complete potyvirus genomes, positive-stranded RNA viruses, yielded highly significant linear relationships. These analyses indicate that viral protein diversification is essentially a smooth process, the major parameter being the nature of the protein more than the ecological niche it finds itself in. Synonymous changes are invariably more frequent than nonsynonymous changes. Positive selection exploits a small proportion of genetic variants, while functional sequence space is sufficiently dense, allowing viable solutions to be found. Although evolution has connotations of change, what has always counted is natural selection or adaptation. It is the only force for the genesis of a novel replicon.","Sola, Monica; Wain-Hobson, Simon",Origin and Evolution of Viruses,283,33

For several decades after the Second World War, companies rarely ventured outside their own national boundaries. While some of the world’s largest corporations, such as Coca-Cola, Ford Motor Company, and Procter & Gamble, had historically engaged in a significant international trade, governments were fearful of exporting technologies, core skills, product, and wealth that might drain national resources in the face of the Cold War. In many cases, enormous markets, such as Eastern Europe, Russia, and China, were closed behind a seemingly impenetrable “iron curtain.” Today, the Cold War has long been part of history. Some of the world’s most vibrant economies, such as China, Brazil, and India, have emerged from behind once closed societies to engage billions of people in global commerce in the search for individual as well as national growth and well-being. The advent of connective technologies have enabled companies at the furthest ends of the earth to network their ideas and their businesses in real-time, accelerate the growth of the international marketplace, and integrate the world’s economic activities.

We employ a volumetric, cubic B-spline parametrised transformation model. Regularisation is based on the logarithm of the singular values of the local Jacobian and ensures diffeomorphic warps. Tensor registration takes reorientation into account during optimisation, through a finite-strain approximation of rotation due to the warp. The combination of scalar, tensor and regularisation cost functions allows us to optimise the deformations in terms of tissue matching, orientation matching and distortion minimisation simultaneously. We apply our method to creating multimodal T2 and DTI MRI brain templates of two small primates (the ring-tailed lemur and rhesus macaque) from high-quality, ex vivo, 0.5/0.6 mm isotropic data. The resulting templates are of very high quality across both modalities and species. Tissue contrast in the T2 channel is high indicating excellent tissue-boundary alignment. The DTI channel displays strong anisotropy in white matter, as well as consistent left/right orientation information even in relatively isotropic grey matter regions. Finally, we demonstrate where the multimodal templating approach overcomes anatomical inconsistencies introduced by unimodal only methods.","Lange, Frederik J.; Smith, Stephen M.; Bertelsen, Mads F.; Khrapitchev, Alexandre A.; Manger, Paul R.; Mars, Rogier B.; Andersson, Jesper L.

This way, the verification result can be validated independently from the verification in a second step. The problem is that there are unfortunately not many tools available for witness-based validation of verification results. We contribute to closing this gap with the approach of validation via verification, which is a way to automatically construct a set of validators from a set of existing verification engines. The idea is to take as input a specification, a program, and a verification witness, and produce a new specification and a transformed version of the original program such that the transformed program satisfies the new specification if the witness is useful to confirm the result of the verification. Then, an ‘off-the-shelf’ verifier can be used to validate the previously computed result (as witnessed by the verification witness) via an ordinary verification task. We have implemented our approach in the validator [Image: see text] , and it was successfully used in SV-COMP 2020 and confirmed 3 653 violation witnesses and 16 376 correctness witnesses.

Vaccinations may precipitate relapses of NS, but there is no available data regarding inactivated influenza (flu) virus vaccines. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of children with NS who had received flu vaccines between 2002 and 2015. The day of flu vaccination was defined as day 0, and the period between the pre-vaccination and the post-vaccination days was defined as − X to + Y. The risk ratios and their 95% confidence intervals for NS relapse rate were estimated by generalized estimating equation (GEE) Poisson regression. RESULTS: A total of 104 pediatric patients received 208 flu vaccines. The mean age at onset of NS was at 4.85 ± 3.87 years old. There were 261 NS relapses between days − 180 and + 180. Compared with the relapse rate in the − 180 to 0 interval (1.19 times/person-year), those in 0 to + 30 (1.23), + 31 to + 60 (1.58), + 61 to + 90 (1.41), + 91 to + 120 (1.41), and + 121 to + 180 (1.32) days groups were slightly increased, but without significance. Multivariate analysis using GEE Poisson regression also showed no significant increase in relapse rate in each day group compared with days − 180 to 0. Risk ratios for NS relapse were significantly higher in children who were treated with steroids at the first vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that flu vaccines should not be avoided in children with NS based on the potential for NS relapses.

The pediatric age group comprises only less than 5% of total COVID-19 worldwide, therefore, large studies in this population are unlikely in the immediate future. Hence, we planned to synthesize the current data that will help in a better understanding of COVID-19 in children. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Four different electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and CENTRAL) were searched for articles related to COVID-19 in the pediatric population. We included studies reporting disease characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 in patients aged less than 19 years. We performed a random-effect meta-analysis to provide pooled estimates of various disease characteristics. RESULTS: 27 studies (4857 patients) fulfilling the eligibility criteria were included in this systematic review, from a total of 883 records. About half of the patients had each of fever and cough, 11% (6–17%) had fast breathing, and 6–13% had gastrointestinal manifestations. Most of the patients had mild to moderate disease, and only 4% had a severe or critical illness. Leukopenia was the commonest reported laboratory abnormality. CONCLUSION: Even among the symptomatic COVID-19 cases, severe manifestations are seen in very few children.

Most of those challenges have existed prior to the pandemic and are linked to a limited implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) - the global agenda acknowledging interconnections between different policy fields. Despite the EU's commitment to implement the Agenda 2030 in its internal and external policies, there is a lack of visibility and sufficient reference to the SDGs on a strategic level as well as in the EU's actions and partnerships in global health. The Union has shown during the Covid-19 pandemic that it is a relevant global health actor; however, there seems to be a lack of strategic visions and resources. The poster aims to illustrate on the one hand the weaknesses and challenges of the EU global health policies in times of Covid-19 and beyond. On the other hand, it identifies advantages of the EU in the field of global health and explores future pathways. Applying a mixed-method approach I did a review of academic and grey literature; content analysis of official EU documents and statements, expert interviews and gathered insights from events such as policy dialogues. Preliminary results indicate that the EU has a strong focus on infectious disease control in its external health policies and hereby neglects the health system dimension and interlinkages with other foreign policies such as trade. Covid-19 has highlighted the importance of resilient health systems in a crisis and the interlinkages between different policies for an effective response. To pursue a genuine health-in-all-policies approach prioritising health system strengthening within a updated strategic roadmap is necessary. Moreover, efforts to ensure an equitable distribution of vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics should be pushed through the development and implementation of respective criteria. KEY MESSAGES: The focus of the EU in global health should shift from a narrow health security lens towards health system strengthening including disease control.

Since the 1950s, all types of JEV vaccines including inactivated, recombinant and live attenuated ones have been licensed. As an example of an extremely successful endeavour, the time is ripe for reviewing the development of JEV vaccines and probing the reasons behind their uniform success. RECENT FINDINGS: Vaccines against JEV have come a long way since the first licensing in the mid-1950s of the mouse brain-grown-inactivated virus preparations, to the present day live-attenuated virus vaccines. A survey of the various inactivated and live vaccines developed against JEV provides a striking insight into the impressive safety and efficacy of all the vaccines available to prevent encephalitis from JEV. This review juxtaposes studies to understand naturally acquired immunity against JEV that have mostly been published post-2000, compares these with those elicited by vaccines and highlights the paucity of data on cell-mediated immune responses elicited by JEV vaccines. SUMMARY: This article not only seeks to make available the immense salient literature on this endeavour in one collection, but also queries the basis for the remarkable success of JEV vaccines, not least of which may be the ease of protecting against encephalitis caused by JEV. To conclude, the true test of the ingenuity of those dedicated to the pursuit of viral vaccines would be success against viral diseases such as HIV-AIDS and dengue that pose a far greater challenge to scientists.","Satchidanandam, Vijaya",Curr Treat Options Infect Dis,283,1

These differences are important considerations for vaccine development efforts and data from large countries in Africa is limited. The aim of this study was to determine serotypes and genotypes of GBS isolates from pregnant women and their newborns in Ethiopia. METHODS: A hospital based cross-sectional study was conducted at three hospitals in Ethiopia from June 2014 to September 2015. Out of 225 GBS isolates, 121 GBS were recovered, confirmed and characterized at CDC’s Streptococcus Laboratory using conventional microbiology methods and whole genome sequencing. RESULTS: Of the 121 isolates, 87 were from rectovaginal samples of pregnant women, 32 from different body parts of their newborns and 2 from blood of newborns with suspected sepsis. There were 25 mother-infant pairs and 24 pairs had concordant strains. The most prevalent serotypes among mothers and/or their babies were II, Ia and V (41.5, 20.6, 19.5 and 40.6%, 25 and 15.6%, respectively). Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) on 83 isolates showed ST10 (24; 28.9%) and ST2 (12; 14.5%) as most predominant sequence types. All GBS strains were susceptible to penicillin, cefotaxime and vancomycin, which correlated to the presence of wildtype PBP2x types and the lack of known vancomycin-resistance genes. Tetracycline resistance was high (73; 88%, associated primarily with tetM, but also tetO and tetL). Five isolates (6%) were resistant to erythromycin and clindamycin and 3 isolates were fluoroquinolone-resistant, containing associated mutations in gyrA and parC genes. All isolates were positive for one of four homologous Alpha/Rib family determinants and 1–2 of the three main pilus types. CONCLUSIONS: Predominant serotypes were II, Ia, and V. A limited number of clonal types were identified with two STs accounting for about half of the isolates. All strains collected in this study were susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics and vancomycin. Typical of most GBS, these isolates were positive for single alpha-like family protein, serine-rich repeat gene, as well as 1–2 pilus determinants.

This phenomenon incurred increased amounts of teleworking and time spent at home, fewer trips to shops, closure of retail outlets selling non-essential goods, and the near disappearance of leisure and recreational activities. This paper presents a novel method for an economy-wide estimate of the emissions reductions caused by the restriction of movement. Using a global multiregional macro-economic model complemented by Google Community Mobility Reports (CMRs) and national transport data, we cover 129 individual countries and quantify direct and indirect global emissions reductions of greenhouse gases (GHG; 1173 Mt), PM(2.5) (0.23 Mt), SO(2) (1.57 Mt), and NO(x) (3.69 Mt). A statistically significant correlation is observed between cross-country emission reductions and the stringency of mobility restriction policies. Due to the aggregated nature of the CMRs, we develop different scenarios linked to consumption, work, and lifestyle aspects. Global reductions are on the order of 1–3% (GHG), 1–2% (PM(2.5)), 0.5–2.8% (SO(2)), and 3–4% (NO(x)). Our results can help support crucial decision making in the post-COVID world, with quantified information about how direct and indirect consequences of mobility changes benefit the environment.","Pomponi, Francesco; Li, Mengyu; Sun, Ya-Yen; Malik, Arunima; Lenzen, Manfred; Fountas, Grigorios; D’Amico, Bernardino; Akizu-Gardoki, Ortzi; Luque Anguita, Maria",Environ Sci Technol Lett,283,1

As such, this paper attempts to investigate the possibility if Bitcoin can be hedged by selected fiat currencies (EUR, JPY and GBP) as Bitcoin prices have experienced high and persistent volatility. To do so, we compute optimal hedge ratios between Bitcoin and fiat currencies over the period 02/02/2012–30/11/2017 based on the VAR-DCC-GARCH model, VAR-ADCC-GARCH model and VAR-component GARCH-DCC model. A rolling window analysis is employed to establish out-of-sample one-step-ahead forecasts of dynamic conditional correlations between different assets. This leads to establish time-varying hedge ratios and thus dynamic cross-hedging Bitcoin/fiat currency markets. The empirical results clearly show the time-varying correlations between Bitcoin and fiat currencies under different specifications, implying a dynamic behavior of the relationship between such assets. For all the proposed models, such dynamic correlations are rather characterized by trending downward over the period under study. The results also display time-varying hedge ratios which lead to an ongoing regular demand for rebalancing the hedged positions under different specifications. As a matter of fact, using various models which take into account different aspects of volatility and correlation structures allows to better implement dynamic hedging strategies.","Majdoub, Jihed; Ben Sassi, Salim; Bejaoui, Azza",Decisions Econ Finan,283,17

This paper builds on seminal marketing thought to propose a conceptual framework that places use of digital marketing analytics tools and channels in the context of a firm’s marketing plan. The framework has diverse applications across many industries and platforms and can help markers avoid falling victim to digital marketing analytics myopia, even as evolving technologies and broader societal forces like the response to Covid-19 accelerate the digitalization of marketing.","Vollrath, Matthew D.; Villegas, Salvador G.",J Market Anal,283,28

Transmission may also occur through other routes, including contaminated surfaces; nevertheless, the role that surfaces have on the spread of the disease remains contested. Here, we use the Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment framework to examine the risks of community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through surfaces and to evaluate the effectiveness of hand and surface disinfection as potential interventions. Using conservative assumptions on input parameters of the model (e.g., dose–response relationship, ratio of genome copies to infective virus), the average of the median risks for single hand-to-surface contact followed by hand-to-face contact range from 1.6 × 10(–4) to 5.6 × 10(–9) for modeled prevalence rates of 0.2%–5%. For observed prevalence rates (0.2%, 1%), this corresponds to a low risk of infection (<10(–6)). Hand disinfection substantially reduces risks of transmission independently of the disease’s prevalence and contact frequency. In contrast, the effectiveness of surface disinfection is highly dependent on the prevalence and the frequency of contacts. The work supports the current perception that contaminated surfaces are not a primary mode of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and affirms the benefits of making hand disinfectants widely available.","Pitol, Ana K.; Julian, Timothy R.",Environ Sci Technol Lett,283,1

Forty-three Veterans were seen remotely at their place of residence by a provider, using a VA Video Connect synchronous videoconferencing system. Veteran and provider satisfaction were collected using the Telerehabilitation Questionnaire (TRQ). Mean individual TRQ scores for both Veterans and providers were significantly higher than the scale midpoint of 3.5. Veterans had higher scores than providers for five individual items on the TRQ. Higher scores by Veterans on the technology and quality and clarity of the video and audio likely correspond to the differences in environmental settings in which the visit occurred for the Veteran compared with the provider. High satisfaction scores with the telerehabilitation assessments are likely attributed to the positive working relationship between the provider and the rehabilitation technician, who provided in-person technical support to the Veteran in the home during the wheeled mobility evaluation. Overall, the results indicate a high level of Veteran and provider satisfaction using telerehabilitation for wheelchair seating and mobility evaluations.","Ott, Kaila K.; Schein, Richard M.; Saptono, Andi; Dicianno, Brad E.; Schmeler, Mark R.",,283,1

This review highlights current means for hydrogen production and use, and the importance of progressing R&D along key technologies and policies to drive a cost reduction in renewable hydrogen production and enable the transition of chemical manufacturing toward green hydrogen as a feedstock and fuel. The chemical industry is at the core of what is considered a modern economy. It provides commodities and important materials, e.g., fertilizers, synthetic textiles, and drug precursors, supporting economies and more broadly our needs. The chemical sector is to become the major driver for oil production by 2030 as it entirely relies on sufficient oil supply. In this respect, renewable hydrogen has an important role to play beyond its use in the transport sector. Hydrogen not only has three times the energy density of natural gas and using hydrogen as a fuel could help decarbonize the entire chemical manufacturing, but also the use of green hydrogen as an essential reactant at the basis of many chemical products could facilitate the convergence toward virtuous circles. Enabling the production of green hydrogen at cost could not only enable new opportunities but also strengthen economies through a localized production and use of hydrogen. Herein, existing technologies for the production of renewable hydrogen including biomass and water electrolysis, and methods for the effective storage of hydrogen are reviewed with an emphasis on the need for mitigation strategies to enable such a transition.","Rambhujun, Nigel; Salman, Muhammad Saad; Wang, Ting; Pratthana, Chulaluck; Sapkota, Prabal; Costalin, Mehdi; Lai, Qiwen; Aguey-Zinsou, Kondo-Francois",MRS Energy & Sustainability,283,0

Activities that combine social, physical and cognitive stimuli are most effective in engaging older adults with apathy but are time consuming and require significant staff resources. We present the results from an initial pilot field study of our socially assistive robotic (SAR) system, Ro-Tri, capable of multi-modal interventions to foster social interaction between pairs of older adults. Seven paired participants attended two sessions a week for three weeks. Sessions consisted of robot-mediated triadic interactions with three types of activities repeated once over the 3 weeks. Ro-Tri gathered quantitative interaction data, head pose, vocal sound, and physiological signals to automatically evaluate older adults’ activity and social engagement. Ro-Tri functioned smoothly without any technical issues. Older adults had > 90% attendance and 100% completion rate and remained engaged with the system throughout the study duration. Participants’ visual attention toward the SAR system and their partners increased 7.2% and 4.7%, respectively, with their interaction effort showing an increase of 2.9%. Older adults and LTC staff had positive perceptions with the system. These initial results demonstrate Ro-Tri’s ability to engage older adults, encourage social human-to-human interaction, and assess the changes using quantitative metrics.

The aim of the present study was to explore KRT15 expression in BRCA based on data obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas and The Genotype-Tissue Expression. KRT15 expression was compared using a Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Functional enrichment analysis was performed to reveal the biological roles and pathways of KRT15. The association between KRT15 expression and immune-cell infiltration was evaluated via single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA). To investigate the relationship between clinicopathological features and KRT15 expression, the prognostic value of KRT15 and other clinical factors was evaluated using Cox regression analysis and Kaplan-Meier (KM) plots. Subgroup prognostic analysis was also performed using forest plots and KM curves. Finally, a tissue microarray was used to assess KRT15 expression in BRCA tissues. KRT15 expression was significantly lower in BRCA tissues compared with that in normal tissues. Functional enrichment analysis suggested that KRT15-related genes were primarily enriched in the transmembrane transporter complex, cornification and ligand-receptor interactions. Increased KRT15 was associated with several tumor-suppressive pathways. ssGSEA revealed that high KRT15 expression was significantly associated with natural killer-cell, B-cell and mast-cell infiltration. Significant associations were observed between low KRT15 expression and advanced stage clinicopathological factors, as well as unfavorable overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival. Multivariate Cox regression analysis suggested that KRT15 was an independent prognostic factor for OS (P=0.039; hazard ratio, 0.590; 95% CI, 0.358-0.974). Subgroup prognostic analysis demonstrated that low KRT15 was a reliable predictor of poor OS. Immunohistochemistry of a tissue microarray indicated that positive KRT15 expression rates were significantly higher in normal tissues compared with those in the BRCA tissues. In conclusion, low KRT15 expression was significantly associated with poor prognosis in patients with BRCA. Thus, KRT15 may serve an important role in BRCA progression and may be used as a promising prognostic marker for diagnostic and prognostic analyses in patients with BRCA.","Zhong, Pengcheng; Shu, Rong; Wu, Huiwen; Liu, Zhiwen; Shen, Xiaoling; Hu, Yingjie",Exp Ther Med,283,1

For this, we tend to parallelize the influence maximization task based on social behavior. In this paper, we introduce a new parallel algorithm, named PSAIIM, for identification of influential users in social network. In PSAIIM, we uses two semantic metrics: the user’s interests and the dynamically-weighted social actions as user interactive behaviors. In order to overcome the size of actual real-world social networks and to minimize the execution time, we used the community structure to apply perfect parallelism to the CPU architecture of the machines to compute an optimal set of influential nodes.

Image segmentation is one of the crucial and challenging steps in the design of a computer-aided diagnosis system owing to the presence of low contrast between skin lesion and background, noise artifacts, color variations, and irregular lesion boundaries. In this paper, we propose a modified and improved encoder-decoder architecture with a smaller network depth and a smaller number of kernels to enhance the segmentation process. The network performs segmentation for skin cancer images to obtain information about the infected area. The proposed model utilizes the power of the VGG19 network’s weight layers for calculating rich features. The deconvolutional layers were designed to regain spatial information of the image. In addition to this, optimized training parameters were adopted to further improve the network’s performance. The designed network was evaluated for two publicly available benchmarked datasets ISIC, and PH(2) consists of dermoscopic skin cancer images. The experimental observations proved that the proposed network achieved the higher average values of segmentation accuracy 95.67%, IoU 96.70%, and BF-score of 89.20% on ISIC 2017 and accuracy 98.50%, IoU 93.25%, and BF-score 84.08% on PH(2) datasets as compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms on the same datasets.","Kaur, Ranpreet; GholamHosseini, Hamid; Sinha, Roopak",Geometry and Vision,283,1

The neural models used were Hodgkin-Huxley, Hindmarsh-Rose, Integrate-and-Fire, and Spike-Response-Model. Discrete models such as Aihara, Rulkov, Izhikevic, and Courbage-Nekorkin-Vdovin were also evaluated. The dynamical systems’ parameters were varied in the search for chaos, by analyzing trajectories and bifurcation diagrams. Then, a coupling term was added to the models to analyze synchronization in a couple, a vector, and a lattice of oscillators. Later, a lattice with variable parameters is used to simulate different biological neurons. Discrete models did not synchronize in vectors and lattices, but the continuous models were successful in all stages, including the Spike Response Model, which synchronized without the use of a coupling force, only by the synchronous time arrival of presynaptic stimuli. However, this model did not show chaotic characteristics. Finally, in the models in which the previous results were satisfactory, lattices were studied where the coupling force between neurons varied in a non-random way, forming clusters of oscillators with strong coupling to each other, and low coupling with others. The possibility of identifying the clusters was observed in the trajectories and phase differences among all neurons in the reticulum detecting where it occurred and where there was no synchronization. Also, the average execution time of the last stage showed that the fastest model is the Integrate-and-Fire.","Toso, Guilherme; Breve, Fabricio",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,283,7

Unemployment numbers have surged, and millions of Americans have found themselves out of work amid the largest pandemic in a century; for these people, anxiety over their own health and that of their loved ones is compounded by financial worry and anxiety over their place in society or in their family. Under such circumstances, long-suppressed trauma often makes itself known, and many job seekers wrestle with paralyzing crises of confidence. This chapter looks at the particular difficulties of coaching unemployed clients to find jobs during the coronavirus pandemic and concomitant recession. It discusses ways in which sustained unemployment can beget feelings of confusion and helplessness, and suggests a multi-step method for restoring clients’ sense of control, helping them communicate their strengths to potential employers and ultimately succeed in obtaining new employment while increasing their sense of agency and self-worth.","Leifman, Howard","Shared Trauma, Shared Resilience During a Pandemic",283,1

Clinicians have been tasked with discovering new and alternative routes for treating their ailing clientele. A particularly vulnerable population is that of the eating disorder demographic as the shift in therapeutic methods such as tele-therapy presses on. While present social norms and attitudes include gaining weight, using food to control one’s anxieties or for comfort, clinicians must navigate their own experience of pandemic life while providing known and novel resources, tools, and interventions to their eating disorder clients. Preliminary risk factors for increased eating disorder symptom-use have emerged and will be discussed. This chapter will also serve as a reflection on clinical innovation and the significance of clinician resiliency in treating eating disorders during this unprecedented time in history.","Lenza, Cassandra","Shared Trauma, Shared Resilience During a Pandemic",283,1

Mostly, the estimation of the matrix conditionality is used for an assessment of the solvability of linear systems, which are important for interpolation, approximation, and solution of partial differential equations especially for large data sets with large range of values. In this contribution, a new approach to the matrix conditionality and the solvability of the linear systems of equations is presented. It is based on the application of the geometric algebra with the projective space representation using homogeneous coordinates representation. However, the physical floating-point representation, mostly the IEEE 754-219, has to be strictly respected as many algorithms fail due to this.","Skala, Vaclav",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,283,1

The widespread use of fast and accurate diagnostic methods can effectively aid in the early identification and elimination of the silent spread of the pandemic by asymptomatic carriers. The diagnostic approach to the SARS CoV-2 may either involve detecting the viral RNA in the acute phase of infection via molecular assays or by detecting the antibodies that may have developed due to viral exposure in the patient’s blood after a few weeks of infection. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay is the gold standard for identification of SARS CoV-2 virus. Besides the RT-PCR, other molecular assay techniques, like isothermal nucleic acid amplification, have been identified as a game changer, as they are rapid, highly efficient and cost-effective and need no expertise to perform. Serological tests like ELISA and lateral flow assays, to detect Covid-19 specific antibodies, play an important role in the diagnostic, surveillance and epidemiological progress of the disease.

Unusually, if not uniquely, the book’s coherence is not to be found in a single educational setting (e.g. K-12 or higher education) but rather in the carefully curated research chapters that have been meticulously collated in the hope that they may inspire new passionate research pursuits that may collectively combine to building the field of Christian education research. The book editors argue that this strategy is urgently needed for research in the field to mature. This introductory chapter to the book initially presents both project background and overview (Sect. 1.1), then introduces the book structure and chapter contents (Sect. 1.2) and finally details the work’s focus and intended contribution to field building (Sect. 1.3).

What are returnees perceptions of personal gains and losses? What are their personal and collective coping strategies for facing problems associated with their return? What are their reactions to current government policies, and what recommendations do they make for future policies? The Singapore study reveals a new reality that both the nation-state and its citizens need to face.

So this chapter turns to these potential alternative influences, focusing first on the strategic actions of presidential contenders, then on the strategic actions of state political parties. Candidate strategies are more numerous, more varied, and more nimble, while state strategies are more grand, more slow-moving, but with more automatic impact. Yet again, they fail to derail an underlying bandwagon, to alter the occupational seedbeds of the contenders, or to neutralize the factional struggles that ultimately produce two individual nominees.","Shafer, Byron E.; Sawyer, Elizabeth M.",Eternal Bandwagon,283,1

Thus, many national systems have been built from the bottom-up in a heterogeneous fashion based on voluntary cooperation, sometimes influenced by state mandates beyond public health and federal funding for public health. In other cases, federal powers related to interstate commerce or national defense gave rise to centralized systems. More recently, federal agencies have played an important role in convening stakeholders, coordinating practice and information standards, and using funding to support implementation as well as induce conformance to standards.

Catering to the need for mental health services is made difficult by access barriers. These barriers consist of structural factors as well as culturally different attitudes towards mental health, mental illness, and therapeutic interventions. One option to overcome these access barriers and to provide mental healthcare services in an appropriate manner is seen in digital interventions. In the form of interactive websites or smartphone apps, these interventions have proven to be effective in mental healthcare. There are also promising examples of successful use of these technologies with refugees. However, the ethical aspects of digital interventions for refugees have scarcely been studied yet. ARGUMENTS: Aim of this paper is to tackle this research desiderate. The instrument of the ethical analysis to be conducted is the concept of agency. According to the concept of agency, persons have to be seen as actors capable of acting based on their own resources and competencies. Agency is the guiding principle here for analyzing the opportunities and risks of digital interventions for refugees. In addition, I will attempt to point out prospects for an agency-based application of digital interventions.

We made a prospective plan to assess accuracy of the Libre on inpatients admitted to COVID units during an initial “validation phase”. Fingerstick blood glucose (FSBG) was checked for the first three days after placing the sensor and compared to Libre values within the next 1–15 minutes. Patients were instructed to scan the sensor after each FSBG, and at other times as clinically warranted. FSBG values were recorded from the medical record (CPRS) and compared to Libre values downloaded to LibreView. The mean absolute relative difference (MARD) between FSBG and Libre was calculated for each patient for one to three days. The average MARD across all patients was calculated. Accuracy was further assessed using the Bland-Altman Plot and error grid analysis using web-based tool. Of the 21 patients assessed in the validation phase, 19 had at least one day of data and 11 had at least three days. The mean MARD was 11.2% after one day, and 12.5% after three days. Four patients after one day and three patients after three days had a MARD of 15–20% where use of the Libre was continued with confirmatory FSBG. In 15/19 (78%) patients with one day of data and 8/11 (73%) of patients with 3 days of data had a MARD <15% and continued using the Libre without further FSBG. One patient had a MARD >20% that did not improve with changing the sensor, and Libre was discontinued. In 16 of 19 patients, the Libre values were lower than FSBG. No adverse events relating to Libre use were identified. Error grid analysis showed that most patients had no values outside the A and B ranges, and very few values outside of the clinically accurate range, occurring in 2 of the 19 patients (9% of values in the “slight risk” zone in 9% in one and 6% in the other). The Libre was well-accepted by patient and nursing staff, but did not have measurable effect on glycemic control, hypoglycemic events, or hospitalization measures. The libre was deemed a useful intervention in inpatients, but it can be inaccurate or only moderately accurate compared to FSBG in enough patients to require checking accuracy for at least 1–3 days. Inaccurate Libre values were mostly lower than FSBG requiring confirmatory measures of low Libre values with FSBG in our experience.","Pandya, Reeni K; Sukkari, Mohamad Anas; Olson, Darin E",J Endocr Soc,283,28

Our aim was to analyse the incidence, clinical presentation, and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection in IBD patients in the second and the third wave of infection. METHODS: Cross-sectional, observational study in IBD patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection by RCP and/or antigen tests from 01 July 2020 to 01 March 2021. All data were collected by telephone interview and reviewing the electronical medical records. RESULTS: Fifty-one of 805 IBD patients followed in our Unit were diagnosed of SARS-CoV-2 infection in this period (6.3%; 95% CI 4.6–8.0). Mean age: 45±13 years old; 56.9% female, 23.5% smokers, 56.9% Crohn’s disease, 29.4% comorbidities and 17.6% asymptomatic. Digestive symptoms were reported in 22 patients (43.1%), with diarrhoea as the most common (39.2%, median duration: 4 days; IQR 1–7). The most frequent symptoms other than diarrhoea were low-grade fever/fever in 43.1% (median duration: 3 days; IQR 1–6.5) and dysosmia/dysgeusia in 39.2% (median duration: 15 days; IQR 7–30). Only one patient (2%) was diagnosed with IBD flare-up during infection. Six patients (11.8%) temporarily withdrew their IBD treatment because of COVID-19. Most of the patients had a mild disease (88.2%), no patient had to be admitted in the intensive care unit. Only one patient died (2%) due to SARS-CoV-2 infection and multiple previous comorbidities, 52 years old male with ulcerative colitis in treatment with Mesalazine and dendritic cell sarcoma, common variable inmunodefiency, and primary sclerosing cholangitis progressing to cirrhosis. In the multivariate analysis, the presence of dyspnoea was associated with more severe infection (p=0.007; OR:25.7; 95% CI 2.4–277.8). Patients on immunomodulators and/or biological therapy did not have more severe disease compared to non-immunosuppressed patients (p>0.05). CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 infection was relatively frequent is our series. Dyspnoea was associated with a more severe infection. Severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection was not related to immunosuppression or development of IBD flare-ups and only a small percentage of patients needed to modify IBD medication during infection","Algaba Garcia, A; Guerra, I; Castro, S; Jiménez, L; Garza, D; Aller, M D M; Granja, A; Guardiola, A; Bellart, M; Pizarro, N; Bermejo, F",J Crohns Colitis,283,1

METHODS: Qualitative research methodology and the social cognitive theory were used. Focus group discussions and in-depth interviews were conducted with children (aged 10–11 years) and their mothers, respectively, from two private and one public schools in Beirut, Lebanon. Thematic inductive analytical approach was adopted. RESULTS: A total of six FGDs and 11 in-depth interviews with mothers were conducted from February till November 2020. Four main overarching themes emerged. Theme 1 pertained to the different views of children and mothers regarding the meaning of healthy eating and physical activity and their perceived impact on children's wellbeing. Theme 2 revealed a set of intrapersonal, social, and environmental determinants, which were reported differently between children and their mothers. Participants in our study who were interviewed after the COVID-19 pandemic talked about how their eating habits were adversely affected as a result of the sudden changes in daily schedules, boredom and anxiety. Theme 3 reflected the role of schools and sports facilities in setting a good example for children's healthy eating and active behaviors. Theme 4 revolved around participants’ suggestions to receive support for healthy eating and lifestyle habits at multiple levels, including intrapersonal, family/social, community, and policy-level strategies. Our findings highlight the importance of using theory-driven interventions, such as the social cognitive theory, to improve long-term health behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: Findings highlight the multiple influences that pertain to children's eating and activity habits and shed light on the need to use child- and parental-driven strategies in the planning and development of programs to promote children's health and wellbeing.

Since its emergence, SARS‐CoV‐2 has resulted in over 86.7 million cases and over 1.87 million deaths worldwide (WHO Coronavirus Disease (COVID‐19) Dashboard). Coronavirus spike glycoproteins assist in entry and infection of cells by binding to the human ACE2 receptor. Because of this, they are the main target for antibodies and inhibitors (Walls et al., 2020). There are many different strains of coronavirus, including SARS‐CoV‐1 and SARS‐CoV‐2. Although these are both β‐coronaviruses that bind to the ACE2 receptor through a spike protein, SARS‐CoV‐2 has been found to be less deadly but more easily transmissible than SARS‐CoV‐1 (Fani et al., 2020). We hypothesized that the variations in the structure of the spike proteins in different strains cause these different characteristics. In order to understand the structural differences between SARS‐CoV‐2 and SARS‐CoV‐1 spike proteins, we compared their structures by aligning them using PyMOL, a molecular visualization system. We observed that the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike proteins have differences in their structure. We will study these to identify their significance. The structure of a protein is directly related to its function which is why we think that this investigation is crucial to understanding COVID‐19. We expect that these regions are important for specific drug targets for SARS‐CoV‐2.","Cetin, Sena; Ng, Sydney; Zunino, Marzia",FASEB J,283,24

We find that there is a statistically significant positive relationship between long-term natural disaster frequency and social trust. We further examine the impact of long-term natural disaster frequency on social trust in specific groups of people. Social trust in neighbors and doctors is stronger where long-term natural disasters are more frequent. Our results are robust after we considering the geographical difference. The effect of long-term natural disasters remains positively significant after we divide the samples based on geographical location.

Most male nurses leave nursing within four years of starting their nursing career. It is crucial to understand the influencing factors on newly graduated male nurses staying in nursing. Previous studies on intentions to stay as nurses were seldom based on theory and failed to consider the differences between genders. Based on the Job Demands-Resources (JD-R) model, this study tested the model that social support, resilience, and nursing professional commitment influence the intention to stay and the mediating effect of nursing professional commitment in the above relationship. This cross-sectional study adopted purposive and snowball sampling methods. Data were collected using online questionnaire, and 272 newly graduated male nurses completed it. The hypothetical model had a good fit with the data. Nursing professional commitment had a complete mediating effect between social support and intention to stay and between resilience and intention to stay. Nursing professional commitment was highly positively correlated to intention to stay. It is suggested that future research and practice should enhance male nurses’ professional commitment to increase their intention to stay. The findings can serve as reference for developing newly graduated male nurse retention programs.","Yu, Hsingyi; Huang, Chunhsia; Chin, Yenfan; Shen, Yungchao; Chiang, Yuehtao; Chang, Chiwen; Lou, Jiunnhorng",Int J Environ Res Public Health,283,1

Despite the presence of fewer airlines in the market, the competition remains intense, which forces airlines to continually search for ways to increase their efficiency to maintain survival and financial sustainability. To evaluate airline performance and disentangle the causes of inefficiency, this paper applied a two-stage network data envelopment analysis approach and a truncated regression to investigate the performance of nine U.S.-based airlines from 2015 to 2019. Our empirical results reveal that during the sample period, airlines’ operating efficiency steadily improved, but the efficiency in the profitability stage stagnated. Therefore, strategic resource allocations are needed for airlines to see further advances in their overall efficiency. On average, airlines operating in the low-cost business model yielded higher efficiency scores than their peers operating in the full-service framework. While an airline’s size, measured in terms of total assets, has a positive influence on operating efficiency, a larger number of full-time employee equivalents hinders efficiency outcomes, which indicates the importance of enhancing labor efficiency among carriers.","Huang, Carol C.; Hsu, Chris C.; Collar, Emilio",JGBC,283,1

Understanding risks for infections, mechanisms of progression, and diagnostic and therapeutic interventions is essential for quality care. Clinical guidance emerges frequently from high-income countries and dissemination of information using traditional methods takes time to reach resource-limited settings. By using case-based learning (CBL) strategies, we sought to expedite this process to improve practices worldwide. We report the implementation of a network-based platform for discussion of infections in the immunocompromised child in resource-limited settings and the potential for dynamic sharing of best care practices. METHODS: Using a virtual meeting platform, we established a weekly appointment and invited members of our regional networks, mainly comprising pediatricians with training / interest in infection care and prevention who care for children with cancer. We solicited cases for discussion by providing an electronic case submission form, a presentation template, a presentation checklist, and a protected health information reminder sheet. Materials were prepared in Spanish and English, launching initially in Spanish (October 2019), then expanding to English (September 2020) alternating between Spanish and English-led discussions. Based on the case of the week, a panel of experts, worldwide infectious disease experts, provided recommendations for care based on published evidence, standardized guidelines, and best practices. Detailed written summaries were captured and shared with case submitters. We recorded attendance and evaluated participant satisfaction and the use of discussed information. Additional CBL materials were developed post-launch to support and expand CBL beyond the live meeting sessions. RESULTS: From October 2019 to December 2020, we hosted 45 online meetings with clinical cases presented from 15 countries and 23 institutions across the globe. We have had a total of 1054 attendees, with an average of 28 participants per live meeting. Discussions included complications grouped by viral, fungal, and mycobacterial infection. A quarterly survey revealed that participants found the case discussions most beneficial for reviewing recent literature and learning practices from invited guest experts. Most respondents have very often or always adopted the recommendations discussed during online meetings for the management of patients locally. Additional materials include: a protected virtual community space for storing all CBL materials and promoting continued participant engagement; a growing index of infections with prepared PubMed searches for quick and easy navigation to peer-reviewed literature (n=9); and, written case summary reports, indexed by infection, made available to all audience members for reference (5=in draft, 12=published). During the first part of the COVID-19 pandemic, we incorporated a journal club structure to discuss emerging literature on the virus, and specifically the implications for children with / without cancer. Participants indicated that COVID-19 activities were extremely useful for discussing and digesting the rapidly evolving scientific literature for SARS-CoV-2 and being able to apply lessons learned in real-time. CONCLUSIONS: A virtual platform for CBL provides a critical resource that expedites information-sharing and can potentially improve patient care by expanding access to expertise and experience for best care practices beyond geographic boundaries.","Gutierrez Tobar, I; Vázquez, M; Happ, B; Kopsidas, I; Tinoco Martín, I; Homsi, M R; Caniza, M A",J Pediatric Infect Dis Soc,283,1

The aim of this study was to identify the major risk factors for 30-day readmission among patients with gram-negative bacteremia. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study including all consecutive adults hospitalized in the medical departments in a referral hospital in Israel with gram-negative bacteremia between 2011 and 2020, who were discharged alive. Predictors for 30-day readmission were investigated, considering death after discharge as a competing event. Cephalosporin resistance was our predictor of interest. Subdistribution hazard ratios (HRs) of the cumulative incidence function were investigated using the Fine and Gray multivariable competing-risk regression model. The prediction models were cross-validated using the k-fold method. RESULTS: Among 2196 patients surviving hospitalization with gram-negative bacteremia, the mean age was 70 ± 16 years and 432 (19.6%) were readmitted within 30 days. Variables associated with readmission hazards were Arab ethnicity, active malignancy, conditions requiring immunosuppression, anxiolytics or hypnotics, anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy, discharge with a nasogastric tube, higher predischarge heart rate, duration of antibiotic therapy during hospitalization, and bacteremia caused by cephalosporin-resistant bacteria (HR, 1.23 [95% confidence interval {CI}, .99–1.52]). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for this model was 75.5% (95% CI, 71.3%–79.1%). In secondary models, cephalosporin resistance, inappropriate empirical antibiotic treatment, and lower predischarge albumin were significantly associated with readmission. CONCLUSIONS: Thirty-day readmissions among patients with gram-negative bacteremia surviving the index admission were high. Readmission was related to comorbidities and infections caused by multidrug-resistant infections. Main point: Among 2196 adults surviving hospitalization with gram-negative bacteremia, 432 (19.6%) were rehospitalized within 30 days. Comorbidities, inappropriate empirical antibiotic treatment, bacteremia caused by cephalosporin-resistant bacteria, predischarge heart rate, and albumin were associated with readmissions.","Porat, Yanay; Nashashibi, Jeries; Poran, Itamar; Paul, Mical",Open Forum Infect Dis,283,1

Nanofibers mimic the porous topography of natural extracellular matrix (ECM), hence they are advantageous for tissue regeneration . In biomedical engineering, electrospinning exhibits advantages as a tissue engineering scaffolds producer, which can make appropriate resemblance in physical structure with ECM. This is because of the nanometer scale of ECM fibrils in diameter, which can be mimicked by electrospinning procedure as well as its porous structure.

To better understand how these evolutionary forces affect codon usage bias, an extensive study to detect how codon usage patterns change across species is required. This study investigated 668 single-copy orthologous genes independently in 29 Drosophila species to determine how the codon usage patterns change with phylogenetic distance. We found a strong correlation between phylogenetic distance and codon usage bias and observed striking differences in codon preferences between the two subgenera Drosophila and Sophophora. As compared to the subgenus Sophophora, species of the subgenus Drosophila showed reduced codon usage bias and a reduced preference specifically for codons ending with C, except for codons with G in the second position. We found that codon usage patterns in all species were influenced by the nucleotides in the codon’s 2nd and 3rd positions rather than the biochemical properties of the amino acids encoded. We detected a concordance between preferred codons and preferred dinucleotides (at positions 2 and 3 of codons). Furthermore, we observed an association between speciation, codon preferences, and dinucleotide preferences. Our study provides the foundation to understand how selection acts on dinucleotides to influence codon usage bias.","Kokate, Prajakta P; Techtmann, Stephen M; Werner, Thomas",G3 (Bethesda),283,30

These factors caused the porosity of sprayed coatings, leading to a significant influence on the coating properties, especially their wear-corrosion resistance. In this study, a post-spray sealing treatment of Cr(3)C(2)-NiCr/Al(2)O(3)-TiO(2) plasma-sprayed coatings was carried out, and then, their corrosion properties were evaluated, before and after the treatment. For the sealing process, aluminum phosphate (APP) containing Al(2)O(3) nanoparticles (~10 nm) was used. The permeability of APP into the sprayed coating was analyzed by SEM-EDS. The treatment efficiency for porosity and corrosion resistance of sprayed coatings was evaluated by electrochemical measurements, such as the potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The wear-corrosion resistance of the coating was examined in 3.5 wt.% NaCl circulation solution containing 0.25% SiO(2) particles. The sealing efficiency was evaluated by the percentage of the treated open pores in the coating. The obtained results showed that APP penetrated deeply through the coating and the incorporation of Al(2)O(3) nanoparticles into APP sealant improved the sealing efficiency by 20% of open pores in comparison with the sealant without nano-Al(2)O(3). The effect of the post-treatment on corrosion protection of the sprayed coating has been discussed.","Van Nguyen, Tuan; Nguyen, Tuan Anh; Pham, Ha Thi; Pham, Ly Thi; Nguyen, Phuong Thi; Dao, Thuy Bich; Van Trinh, Trung; Vu, Duong; Le, Quy Thu",J Therm Spray Tech,283,16

Spirometers may measure even small air leakage, therefore, the spirometer technique requires a higher cuff pressure than the MOV technique to completely seal the airway. This study aimed to evaluate the difference in cuff pressure between the two techniques used to seal the airway. Methods Thirty-five female patients were intubated using an ETT with a cuff, and cuff inflation was performed with both techniques at a 10-min interval in random order-the MOV technique and then the spirometer technique or vice versa. The cuff pressure was measured at each period. Results The cuff pressures were 16.7 ± 4.4 cmH2O and 18.7 ± 5.2 cmH2O for the MOV and spirometer techniques, respectively. The cuff pressure for the spirometer technique was 2.0 cmH2O higher than that for the MOV technique and this difference was statistically significant (95% confidence interval, 0.7-3.3; P = 0.003). Considering the upper end (3.3 cmH2O) of the 95% confidence interval and the size of one scale unit (2.0 cmH2O) of a manometer, the difference in cuff pressure was up to 4 cmH2O in practice. Conclusions Even though the air leakage sound disappears on auscultation, unlike the previous recommendation, the airway sealing would be completed only by increasing the cuff pressure by approximately 4 cmH2O.","Park, Ha Yeon; Kim, Mina; In, Junyong",Anesthesia and pain medicine,283,25

In this review, a total of 66 studies were included, providing data for 67 patients. A prosthetic valve was present in 16.4%, while the most common causative pathogen was K. pneumoniae followed by K. oxytoca. The aortic valve was the most commonly infected intracardiac site, followed by the mitral valve. The diagnosis was based on transthoracic echocardiography in 46.2%, while the diagnosis was set at autopsy in 9.2% of included patients. Blood cultures were positive in 93.8%. Fever and sepsis were the most frequent clinical presentations, followed by embolic phenomena, paravalvular abscess, and heart failure. Cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, and carbapenems were the most frequently used antimicrobials. Surgical treatment along with antimicrobials was performed in 37.3% of included patients. Clinical cure was noted in 80.3%, while the overall mortality was 19.4%. Infection at the aortic valve was independently associated with mortality by IE.

METHODS Dextran dicysteine mannose was radiolabeled using the carbonyl method. Various parameters were studied such as in vitro stability at room temperature up to 5 h, protein binding and partition coefficient. Bioevaluation was performed in a rabbit model by developing images under a gamma camera at various time intervals. Biodistribution was performed in Wistar rat models (n = 3) by dissection and measurement of percent injected dose in various body organs, at 60 and 180 min post-injection intervals. Biodistribution was performed in two different groups of animals: in the first group, the radiolabeled compound was injected at a concentration of 200 μg/ml, thus delivering 10 μg radiolabeled compound at the site of injection; in the second group, the radiolabeled compound was injected at a concentration of 50 μg/ml, delivering 2.5 μg radiolabeled compound at the site of injection. RESULTS Radiolabeling efficacy was 97.5 ± 1% which remained quite stable till 5 h. Protein binding data show that 71.1 ± 5% drug exhibited binding with blood proteins. Partition coefficient results show that our radiopharmaceutical is quite hydrophilic in nature. It can be inferred from the imaging data that sentinel node can be visualized within 30 min post-injection. Rat dissection data showed that when the radiolabeled compound was injected at a concentration of 50 μg/ml, at 60 min post-injection, ~2.85% of activity was retained in the sentinel node with a significantly less accumulation, e.g., ~0.12%, in the secondary node, which resulted in very high popliteal extraction (PE) value, e.g., ~98%. At 180 min post-injection, 2.46 ± 0.29 % was found to be retained in the sentinel node and PE (99.64 ± 0.23%), thus resulting in almost complete washout from the secondary node (0.05 ± 0.01%). CONCLUSION The study demonstrates that radiolabeled DCCM might be a successful radiopharmaceutical for sentinel node detection.","Khan, Irfan U; Shahid, Abubaker; Ahmad, Fayyaz; Dar, Ume K; Ahmad, Munir; Javed, Muhammad",Annals of nuclear medicine,283,1

OBJECTIVES To assess the effectiveness of antihistamine-decongestant-analgesic combinations in reducing the duration and alleviating the symptoms of the common cold in adults and children. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 4), which contains the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, OLDMEDLINE (1953 to 1965), MEDLINE (1966 to November Week 3, 2011) and EMBASE (1990 to December 2011). SELECTION CRITERIA Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the effectiveness of antihistamine-decongestant-analgesic combinations compared with placebo, other active treatment (excluding antibiotics) or no treatment in children and adults with the common cold. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently extracted and summarised data on general recovery, nasal obstruction, rhinorrhoea, sneezing, cough and side effects. We categorised the trials according to the active ingredients. MAIN RESULTS We included 27 trials (5117 participants) of common cold treatments. Fourteen trials studied antihistamine-decongestant combinations; two antihistamine-analgesic; six analgesic-decongestant; and five antihistamine-analgesic-decongestant combinations. In 21 trials the control intervention was placebo and in six trials an active substance. Reporting of methods in most trials was poor and there were large differences in design, participants, interventions and outcomes. Pooling was only possible for a limited number of studies and outcomes.Antihistamine-decongestant: 12 trials. Eight trials report on global effectiveness, six could be pooled; n = 309 on active treatment, n = 312 placebo) the odds ratio (OR) of treatment failure was 0.27 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.15 to 0.50); the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) was four (95% CI 3 to 5.6). On the final evaluation day 41% of participants in the placebo group had a favourable response compared to 66% on active treatment. Of the two trials that were not included in the pooling, one showed some global effect, the other showed no effect.Antihistamine-analgesic: three trials. Two reported on global effectiveness, data from one study was presented. (n = 290 on active treatment, n = 292 ascorbic acid). The OR of treatment failure was 0.33 (95% CI 0.23 to 0.46) and the NNTB was 6.67 (95% CI 4.76 to 12.5). After six days of treatment 43% were cured in the control group and 70% in the active treatment group. The second study also showed an effect in favour of active treatment.Analgesic-decongestant: six trials. One trial reported on global effectiveness: 73% benefited compared with 52% in the control group (paracetamol) (OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.52).Antihistamine-analgesic-decongestant: Five trials. Four trials reported on global effectiveness, two could be pooled: global effect reported (less than one severity point on a four or five-point scale) with active treatment (52%) and placebo (34%); the OR of treatment failure was 0.47 (95% CI 0.33 to 0.67) and the NNTB was 5.6 (95% CI 3.8 to 10.2). Two other trials found no beneficial effect. Two other studies did not show any effect.Two studies with antihistamine-decongestant (113 children) could not be pooled. There was no significant effect of the active treatment.Adverse effects: the combination of antihistamine-decongestant had more adverse effects than the control intervention but the difference was not significant: 157/810 (19%) versus 60/477 (13%) participants suffered one or more adverse effects (OR 1.58, 95% CI 0.78 to 3.21). Analgesic-decongestant combinations had significantly more adverse effects than control (OR 1.71, 95% CI 1.23 to 2.37); the number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) was 14. None of the other two combinations caused significantly more adverse effects. Antihistamine-analgesic: 11/90 with combination suffered one or more adverse effects (12%) versus 9/91 (10%) with control (OR 1.27, 95% CI 0.50 to 3.23). Antihistamine-analgesic-decongestant: in one study 5/224 (2%) suffered adverse effects with active treatment versus 9/208 (4%) with placebo. Two other trials reported no differences between treatment groups but numbers were not reported. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Current evidence suggests that antihistamine-analgesic-decongestant combinations have some general benefit in adults and older children. These benefits must be weighed against the risk of adverse effects. There is no evidence of effectiveness in young children.","De Sutter, An I M; van Driel, Mieke L; Kumar, Anna A; Lesslar, Olivia; Skrt, Alja",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,283,31

However, much of the available evidence comes from high-income countries, where different health profiles challenge the application of this research to low/middle-income countries (LMICs). It is largely unknown what ML applications are available for LMICs that can support and advance clinical medicine and public health. We aim to address this gap by conducting a scoping review of health-related ML applications in LMICs. METHODS AND ANALYSIS This scoping review will follow the methodology proposed by Levac et al. The search strategy is informed by recent systematic reviews of ML health-related applications. We will search Embase, Medline and Global Health (through Ovid), Cochrane and Google Scholar; we will present the date of our searches in the final review. Titles and abstracts will be screened by two reviewers independently; selected reports will be studied by two reviewers independently. Reports will be included if they are primary research where data have been analysed, ML techniques have been used on data from LMICs and they aimed to improve health-related outcomes. We will synthesise the information following evidence mapping recommendations. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION The review will provide a comprehensive list of health-related ML applications in LMICs. The results will be disseminated through scientific publications. We also plan to launch a website where ML models can be hosted so that researchers, policymakers and the general public can readily access them.","Carrillo-Larco, Rodrigo M; Tudor Car, Lorainne; Pearson-Stuttard, Jonathan; Panch, Trishan; Miranda, J Jaime; Atun, Rifat",BMJ open,283,1

However, the association of obesity with the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is unclear. We examined this association using data from the only referral hospital in Shenzhen, China. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A total of 383 consecutively hospitalized patients with COVID-19 admitted from 11 January 2020 to 16 February 2020 and followed until 26 March 2020 at the Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen were included. Underweight was defined as a BMI <18.5 kg/m2, normal weight as 18.5-23.9 kg/m2, overweight as 24.0-27.9 kg/m2, and obesity as ≥28 kg/m2. RESULTS Of the 383 patients, 53.1% were normal weight, 4.2% were underweight, 32.0% were overweight, and 10.7% were obese at admission. Obese patients tended to have symptoms of cough (P = 0.03) and fever (P = 0.06) compared with patients who were not obese. Compared with normal weight patients, those who were overweight had 1.84-fold odds of developing severe COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR] 1.84, 95% CI 0.99-3.43, P = 0.05), while those who were obese were at 3.40-fold odds of developing severe disease (OR 3.40, 95% CI 1.40-2.86, P = 0.007), after adjusting for age, sex, epidemiological characteristics, days from disease onset to hospitalization, presence of hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, liver disease and cancer, and drug used for treatment. Additionally, after similar adjustment, men who were obese versus those who were normal weight were at increased odds of developing severe COVID-19 (OR 5.66, 95% CI 1.80-17.75, P = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS In this study, obese patients had increased odds of progressing to severe COVID-19. As the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 may continue to spread worldwide, clinicians should pay close attention to obese patients, who should be carefully managed with prompt and aggressive treatment.","Cai, Qingxian; Chen, Fengjuan; Wang, Tao; Luo, Fang; Liu, Xiaohui; Wu, Qikai; He, Qing; Wang, Zhaoqin; Liu, Yingxia; Liu, Lei; Chen, Jun; Xu, Lin",Diabetes care,283,1

AIM It was aimed to compare the symptoms of patients with COVID-19 positivity and patients without COVID-19 positivity hospitalized with suspicion of COVID-19. METHODS Patients presenting to the Sakarya University Training and Research Hospital with suspicion of COVID-19 were included in the study. Samples were obtained from the patients and PCR tests were performed; the patients were grouped as COVID-19 positive and COVID-19 negative; these two groups were questioned for 15 symptoms and the results were compared. RESULTS A total of 297 patients with suspicion of COVID-19 were included in the study. COVID-19 was positive in 143 patients and negative in 154 patients. The most common symptoms in the COVID-19 positive group were: cough (56.6%), weakness (56.6%), taste disorder (35.7%), myalgia (34.3%), and fever (33.6%); and in the COVID-19 negative group: cough (63%), weakness (45.5%), dyspnea (29.9%), headache (27.3%) and fever (24.7%). When these two groups were compared, taste disorder, smell disorder and diarrhea were significantly higher in the COVID-19 positive group (p = <0,00001, p = 0,00001 and p = 0,02).

Wuhan, Hubei Province, is the hardest-hit region, with a rise in confirmed cases and its hospitals overwhelmed. On 2nd February, 2020, Wuhan began to build a modular hospital to treat patients caught with mild illness. The mobile modular hospital is mainly composed of medical modules, technical support modules, ward units, living support units and transportation capacity under field conditions, and there are complete equipment and specialized personnel to treat patients. Due to the severity and particularity of SARS-CoV-2, taking granted from lessons learnt from mobile modular hospitals, we use the existing large venues to construct a new fixed modular hospital. As patients need to be treated and tested, it is important to develop a clinical laboratory in the modular hospital and ensure biosafety. The construction of a clinical laboratory in the modular hospital is faced with problems such as time pressure, limited site selection, high level of biosafety, lack of experience and so forth. This paper mainly discusses how to construct the clinical laboratory in the modular hospital quickly and safely and put it into use to provide testing service for patients under various limited conditions.","Yusong, Liu; Duanliang, Peng; Jia, Yang; Dunyan, Chen; Hongbing, Jia; Siyuan, Yu; Huanhuan, Chen; Juan, Zhao; Lyurong, Liu",Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine,283,1

A cross-sectional survey was conducted during the ""third wave"" of the COVID-19 pandemic in Thailand (March to April 2021). The survey was uploaded and administered via the online survey platform of Google™. Thai citizens aged >18 years completed the survey. All factors that predicted the vaccine intention (VI) among participants were measured and analyzed using logistics regression and cross-tabulation. Among 862 participants, 55.6% said they were likely to get a COVID-19 vaccine. From the finding of the logistic regression, men were more likely to be vaccinated than women. Respondents with more than three health conditions were less likely to get vaccinated compared with those without any health conditions. People at a higher risk of health conditions had the lowest VI in any age group. Among the older age group, the number of health conditions affected the VI. The potential harmful side effects of a COVID-19 vaccine was the main reason for vaccine hesitancy. Overall, ~56% of respondents to an online questionnaire intended to become vaccinated against COVID-19. The older age group with a high risk of health conditions had the lowest VI even though this group should get the vaccine first. Therefore, there is an urgent need to design an education strategy to overcome such vaccine hesitancy.","Boon-Itt, Sakun; Rompho, Nopadol; Jiarnkamolchurn, Sompong; Skunkan, Yukolpat",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,283,1

It has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020 and the outbreak still keeps its impacts worldwide. Behçet's disease (BD) is a multi-systemic vasculitis involving the skin, mucosa, eyes, joints, nervous system, cardiovascular system, and gastrointestinal system. The precise etiopathogenesis of the disorder is unknown but autoimmunity is believed to play a key role. A considerable part of patients with BD are susceptible to immunosuppression and are more predisposed to infections than healthy individuals. Hence, the protection and control measures for patients with BD against the COVID-19 are of the utmost significance. Given the requirement to balance proper treatment of BD with the smallest risk of COVID-19 associated mortality and morbidity, we aimed to review the management of BD in the era of the pandemic with a special focus on treatment considerations. According to current expert recommendations, there is no reason to discontinue topical treatments, colchicine, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Systemic steroids can be used at the lowest possible dose if needed. Ongoing treatments can be continued unchanged in patients with no suspected or confirmed COVID-19. In cases with COVID-19 symptoms, immunosuppressive and biological agents can be temporarily stopped but the decision should be made on a case by case basis. Considering their potential beneficial effects on the course of COVID-19, colchicine, pentoxifylline, and dapsone can be considered as safe treatment options in BD.

The procedure consists of three technical processes: transoral placement of the anvil with the head pre-tilted, extracorporeal preparation of the Roux-en-Y limb, and intracorporeal gastrojejunostomy with a circular stapler introduced via an umbilical mini-laparotomy. We applied the procedure to 33 patients with early gastric cancer between December 2008 and June 2010. None of the patients suffered from surgical complications related either to the transoral placement of the anvil or the anastomoses. The postoperative wound appearance was much less conspicuous than that of conventional laparoscopic distal gastrectomy, because our procedure needed only a 4-cm mini-laparotomy on the umbilicus, except for the trocar ports. This technique involving transoral anvil placement enables intracorporeal anastomosis for gastrojejunostomy via an umbilical mini-laparotomy, and may be one of the surgical choices for anastomosis and Roux-en-Y reconstruction following LADG.","Ohashi, Manabu; Iwanaga, Tomohiro; Ohinata, Ryouki; Kanda, Tatsuo; Iwasaki, Yoshiaki",Gastric cancer : official journal of the International Gastric Cancer Association and the Japanese Gastric Cancer Association,283,27

However, the low in vivo stability of BN conjugates may limit their clinical application. In an attempt to improve their pharmacokinetics and counteract their rapid enzymatic degradation, we prepared a series of polyethylene glycol (PEG)-ylated BN(7-14) analogues for radiolabeling with (99m)Tc(CO)(3) and evaluated them in vitro and in vivo. METHODS Derivatization of a stabilized (N(α)His)Ac-BN(7-14)[Cha(13),Nle(14)] analogue with linear PEG molecules of various sizes [5 kDa (PEG(5)), 10 kDa (PEG(10)) and 20 kDa (PEG(20))] was performed by PEGylation of the ɛ-amino group of a β(3)hLys-βAla-βAla spacer between the stabilized BN sequence and the (N(α)His)Ac chelator. The analogues were then radiolabeled by employing the (99m)Tc-tricarbonyl technique. Binding affinity and internalization/externalization studies were performed in vitro in human prostate carcinoma PC-3 cells. Stability was investigated in vitro in human plasma and in vivo in Balb/c mice. Finally, single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/X-ray computed tomography studies were performed in nude mice bearing PC-3 tumor xenografts. RESULTS PEGylation did not affect the binding affinity of BN analogues, as the binding affinity for BN(2)/GRP receptors remained high (K(d)<0.9 nM). However, in vitro binding kinetics of the PEGylated analogues were slower. Steady-state condition was reached after 4 h, and the total cell binding was 10 times lower than that for the non-PEGylated counterpart. Besides, PEGylation improved the stability of BN conjugates in vitro and in vivo. The BN derivative conjugated with a PEG(5) molecule showed the best pharmacokinetics in vivo, i.e., faster blood clearance and preferential renal excretion. The tumor uptake of the (99m)Tc-PEG(5)-Lys-BN conjugate was slightly higher compared to that of the non-PEGylated analogue (3.91%±0.44% vs. 2.80%±0.28% injected dose per gram 1 h postinjection, p.i.). Tumor retention was also increased, resulting in a threefold higher amount of radioactivity in the tumor at 24 h p.i. Furthermore, decreased hepatobiliary excretion and increased tumor-to-nontarget ratios (tumor-to-blood: 17.1 vs. 2.1; tumor-to-kidney: 1.1 vs. 0.4; tumor-to-liver: 5.8 vs. 1.0, 24 h p.i.) were observed and further confirmed via small-animal SPECT images 1 h p.i. CONCLUSION PEGylation proved to be an effective strategy to enhance the tumor-targeting potential of (99m)Tc-labeled BN-based radiopharmaceuticals and probably other radiolabeled peptides.","Däpp, Simone; García Garayoa, Elisa; Maes, Veronique; Brans, Luc; Tourwé, Dirk A; Müller, Cristina; Schibli, Roger",Nuclear medicine and biology,283,29

The activity of human milk banks was affected during that period, making it necessary to implement new measures in order to promote milk donation and diminish said impact. Method and objective: the aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of the state of alarm decreed from March 14 to June 22, 2020 on the breastmilk bank at Hospital Virgen de las Nieves, Granada, Spain, in comparison with the same period during the previous year. To that end, a retrospective descriptive study was undertaken in which the activity indicators of the breastmilk bank were collected and compared to data from the milk bank at Hospital Virgen de las Nieves and peripheral collaborating centers. RESULTS during the first state of alarm in 2020 a global reduction was seen in new donor registrations, number of donors who donated milk, donated mean volume per mother, and total volume of received and pasteurized milk. However, new registrations and number of donors who donated milk during this period increased in Granada's breastmilk bank. DISCUSSION the new measures adopted in the breastmilk bank in Granada, such as encouraging milk donation in mothers with admitted newborns in the Neonatal Unit, increasing information given to mothers, and home collection of donated milk, allowed to attenuate the impact of the pandemic while guaranteeing safety.","Miranda Romera, Patricia; Peña Caballero, Manuela; Martín Álvarez, Estefanía; Serrano López, Laura; Hurtado Suazo, José Antonio",Nutricion hospitalaria,283,16

The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of the use of temporary Solitaire AB stent-assisted technique with coiling for the treatment of acutely ruptured wide-neck aneurysms without perioperative antiplatelet therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective review of our endovascular data base identified all patients treated in the acute phase with a temporary stent-assisted technique by use of a fully resheathable Solitaire AB stent and coiling. One-year clinical and angiographic outcomes were evaluated. RESULTS Eight patients (5 women and 3 men; mean age, 57.5 years) with 8 ruptured wide-neck aneurysms were treated. There were 3 complications without clinical impact. Postoperative complete occlusion was achieved in 5 aneurysms, and 3 had a neck remnant. Three patients had an mRS score of 0, and 1 an mRS score of 3. Among the 4 patients admitted with a World Federation of Neurological Societies grade of V, 1 died, 1 improved to an mRS score of 1, and the other 2 achieved mRS scores of 4 and 5. Five had a stable occlusion, and 2 of the 3 incompletely occluded aneurysms underwent recanalization. CONCLUSIONS In this small series, temporary placement of the Solitaire AB stent during coiling was a feasible and effective treatment for acutely ruptured wide-neck aneurysms. This technique, avoiding the need for perioperative antiplatelet therapy, could be a valuable option for the treatment of such lesions when the balloon remodeling technique is either not an option or unsuccessful.","Signorelli, F; Gory, B; Turjman, F",AJNR.

The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of preoperative physical performance on postoperative pulmonary complications in patients awaiting lung resection surgery. In this prospective multicenter cohort study, the characteristics of patients and postoperative pulmonary complications were compared between subjects with low (<10) and high (≥10) Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) scores. Postoperative pulmonary complications were defined as over grade II in Clavien-Dindo classification system. We estimated the effects of physical performance on postoperative pulmonary complications using multivariable hierarchical logistic regression. The postoperative pulmonary complications were compared between 331 patients in the high and 33 patients in the low SPPB group. Patients in the low SPPB score group had a significantly higher rate of postoperative pulmonary complications (p < 0.001). Low SPPB score was associated with a higher risk of postoperative pulmonary complications (odds ratio, 8.80; p < 0.001). The SPPB is a clinically useful evaluation tool to assess surgical patients' physical performance. The low physical performance indicated by the SPPB may be predictive of postoperative pulmonary complications after lung resection surgery.Trial registration: Clinical Trials.

Ultrasound examination confirmed intrauterine death. Placenta histology showed necrosis of the villous trophoblast, associated with Chronic Histiocytic Intervillositis (CHI) and Massive Perivillous Fibrin Deposition (MPFD) with up to 90% - of the intervillous spaces being involved. Immunohistochemistry showed CD68 positive histiocytes in the intervillous spaces and the villous trophoblast was positive for the COVID-19 spike protein. RNA scope signal was indicative of the presence of the viral genome and active viral replication in the villous trophoblastic cells, respectively. MPFD is a gradually developing end-stage disease with various etiology, including autoimmune and alloimmune maternal response to antigens expressed at the feto-maternal interface and frequently accompanies chronic alloimmune villitis or histiocytic intervillositis. Covid-19 infection is associated with similar pattern of histological changes of the placenta leading to placental insufficiency and fetal death.

METHODS We used the Epilepsy Phenome/Genome Project (EPGP) dataset that consisted of 2,197 participants in 1,043 family units with ≥2 members having a common generalized (GE) or non-acquired focal epilepsy (NAFE). We identified participants with a history of traditionally defined SE (TSE) (seizures ≥30 minutes) and operationally defined SE (OSE) (seizures ≥10 minutes) by chart review. We assessed familial aggregation of TSE and OSE using χ2 analysis and generalized estimating equations (GEE). RESULTS One hundred fifty-five (7%) participants in 1,043 families had ≥1 episode of TSE. Two hundred fifty (11%) had ≥1 episode of OSE. In a χ2 analysis, the number of family units with ≥2 members having TSE (odds ratio [OR] 4.79, 95% CI 2.56-8.97) or OSE (OR 4.23, 95% CI 2.67-6.70) was greater than expected by chance. In GEE models adjusting for sex, broad epilepsy class (GE or NAFE), age at onset, and duration of epilepsy, TSE in a proband predicted TSE in a first-degree relative (OR 2.79, 95% CI 1.24-6.22), and OSE in a proband predicted OSE in a first-degree relative (OR 2.91, 95% CI 1.65-5.15). The results remained significant in models addressing epilepsy severity by incorporating the number of antiseizure medications used or epilepsy surgery. CONCLUSIONS TSE and OSE showed robust familial aggregation in a cohort of familial epilepsy independently of epilepsy severity or class, suggesting that genetic factors contribute to SE independently of the genetic cause of these epilepsies.","Weisenberg, Judith L Z; Fitzgerald, Robert T; Constantino, John N; Winawer, Melodie R; Thio, Liu Lin",Neurology,283,16

Our purpose was to report our surgical and clinical experiences and outcomes of 47 cases of robot-assisted pancreatic resection to show that minimally invasive pancreatic surgery is both feasible and effective. METHODS The medical records of 47 patients who underwent robot-assisted pancreatic resections for adenocarcinoma, cystic tumours or other pancreatic diseases at our institution by a single surgical team from March 2010 to December 2011 were retrospectively analysed. RESULTS There were 32 females and 15 males with a mean age of 48.7 ± 15.4 years, of whom 13 patients had pathologically diagnosed malignancies, 25 had cystic tumours or chronic pancreatitis, three had solid pseudopapillary tumours of pancreas, and six had other lesions. Sixteen patients underwent pancreatoduodenectomy, 16 distal pancreatectomies (nine of which had spleen resections), 10 middle pancreatectomies, four Beger's procedure, and one had enucleation of a pancreatic lesion. The mean surgical time was 299.2 ± 133.5 (range 70-540) min and mean blood loss was 431.8 ± 309.0 (range 50-1100) ml. Nine patients required a blood transfusion (mean transfusion volume 597.2 ± 543.3 ml). There were no conversions to laparotomy. The mean hospital stay was 29.4 ± 9.1 (range 8-41) days. Pancreatic fistula occurred in 20 cases, anastomotic bleeding in three patients and anastomotic leakage in one patient. Two patients, one who received a PD and one who received a distal pancreatectomy, required a second surgery. All other complications were resolved with conservative management. Surgical margins were negative in all cases, with a postoperative histopathological diagnosis of malignancy. Eleven of the 13 patients with malignancies were alive and well without recurrence at the time of publication, while two patients died. CONCLUSIONS Our series of 47 robot-assisted pancreatic resections adds further evidence that this technique is feasible and effective.","Zhan, Qian; Deng, Xia-Xing; Han, Bo; Liu, Qin; Shen, Bai-Yong; Peng, Cheng-Hong; Li, Hong-Wei",The international journal of medical robotics + computer assisted surgery : MRCAS,283,1

METHODS The 2012-2015 Nationwide Inpatient Sample was queried for all patients undergoing surgical resection of malignant brain tumors. These patients were then grouped by the presence of concurrent diagnosis of hyponatremia, and compared with respect to various clinical features, peri- and postoperative complications, all-cause mortality, discharge disposition, length of stay, and hospitalization costs. Propensity score matching was utilized to control for appropriate baseline confounders and the influence of other endpoint variables. RESULTS The search criteria identified 12,480 adult patients admitted for malignant brain tumor resection, of whom 1,162 (9.3%) developed hyponatremia in the perioperative period. Patients with obstructive hydrocephalus (RR = 1.23, P<0.001), diabetes (RR = 1.14, P=0.014), hypertension (RR = 1.15, P<0.001), and depression (RR = 1.24, P<0.002) were more likely to develop hyponatremia. Tumor location was not associated with risk of developing hyponatremia. Patients with hyponatremia were more likely to require ventriculostomy (RR = 1.23, P<0.001), ventriculoperitoneal shunt (RR = 1.34, P<0.001), and lumbar puncture (RR = 1.25, P<0.001), and were also more likely to be discharged to short-term hospital (RR = 1.25, P<0.001) or rehabilitation (RR = 1.21, P<0.001), as well as have longer hospital stay (P<0.001) and increased hospital charges (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS Patients with obstructive hydrocephalus, diabetes, hypertension, and depression were more likely to develop perioperative hyponatremia. Hyponatremia was associated with increased morbidity following malignant brain tumor resection.","Patel, Saavan; Chiu, Ryan G; Rosinski, Clayton L; Chaker, Anisse N; Burch, Taylor G; Behbahani, Mandana; Sadeh, Morteza; Mehta, Ankit I",World neurosurgery,283,16

These observations could be reinforced by the more and more evident existence of a lung-gut axis, suggesting the modulation of gut microbiota among the approaches to the COVID-19 prevention and treatment. As different possible roles of probiotics in this extremely severe illness have been contemplated, the aim of this work is to collect all the currently available information related to this topic, providing a starting point for future studies focussing on it.","Bottari, Benedetta; Castellone, Vincenzo; Neviani, Erasmo",International journal of food sciences and nutrition,283,16

They are the master regulators of cation Cl- cotransporters that could be targeted for discovering novel antihypertensive agents. Both kinases have a conserved carboxy-terminal (CCT) domain that recognizes a unique peptide motif (Arg-Phe-Xaa-Val) present in their upstream kinases and downstream substrates. Here, we have combined molecular docking with molecular dynamics simulations and free-energy calculations to identify potential inhibitors that can bind to the allosteric pocket of the OSR1-CCT domain and impede its interaction with the WNK peptide. Our study revealed that STOCK1S-14279 and Closantel bound strongly to the allosteric pocket of OSR1 and displaced the WNK peptide from the primary pocket of OSR1. We showed that primarily Arg1004 and Gln1006 of the WNK4-peptide motif were involved in strong H-bond interactions with Glu453 and Arg451 of OSR1. Besides, our study revealed that atoms of Arg1004 were solvent-exposed in cases of STOCK1S-14279 and Closantel, implying that the WNK4 peptide was moved out of the pocket. Overall, the predicted potential inhibitors altogether abolish the OSR1-WNK4-peptide interaction, suggesting their potency as a prospective allosteric inhibitor against OSR1.","Jonniya, Nisha Amarnath; Zhang, Jinwei; Kar, Parimal",The journal of physical chemistry.

Fatty acids, such as arachidic acid (AA), self-assemble on graphite into a sheet of parallel stripes with a periodicity of twice its molecular chain length. The molecular pattern is thus defined precisely by the size and functionality of the headgroup and tailgroup of the amphiphile. Complexation of metal ions to AA fixes the number and location of the ion, which can serve as a precursor to semiconductor nanocrystal arrays. In order to understand the effect of the ion complexation, we carry out atomic force microscopy (AFM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) investigations of AA self-assembly in the presence of various metal ions. While the stripe orientation is dictated by the graphite lattice and the stripe periodicity is determined by the AA chain length, the size, shape, and degree of order of the stripe crystalline domain are influenced by the metal ion bond strength to the carboxylic ligand. The change of morphology in the self-assembled pattern shows a trend along the Irving-Williams series.","Dong, Wen-Fei; Wang, Ruomiao; Mao, Guangzhao; Möhwald, Helmuth",Soft matter,283,1

Pregabalin, a gabapentinoid, is a neuromodulator that could potentially improve visceral hypersensitivity in FD patients. AIM To assess the efficacy and safety of pregabalin for the treatment of FD METHODS: We performed a randomised placebo-controlled study including FD patients who did not respond to proton pump inhibitors. Patients were randomly assigned to receive pregabalin (75 mg daily) or placebo for 8 weeks. The primary outcome was an adequate relief response rate. The secondary outcomes were improvement in quality of life, pain scores in divided categories, and safety profile. RESULTS Of 72 patients enrolled, 34 received pregabalin and 38 received placebo. The self-reported adequate relief rates in the pregabalin and placebo groups were 70.6% and 42.1% at week 4 (P = 0.02), and 70.6% and 44.7% at week 8 (P = 0.03), respectively. The reduction in global symptoms in the pregabalin and placebo groups were 11.7 ± 10.6 and 3.7 ± 8.9 points at week 4 (P < 0.01) and 15.1 ± 12.2 and 8.0 ± 10.2 points at week 8 (P = 0.01), respectively. Pregabalin improved the overall quality of life (P = 0.03). The most common adverse event with pregabalin was dizziness, occurring in 51.6% of patients.

Back pain is the main symptom leading patients to seek medical consultation. Stabilization exercise has been shown effective for reducing back pain. No literature review has examined the effects of such exercises in adults with scoliosis. The objective was to systematically review the effects of stabilization exercises on back pain, disability and quality of life in adults with scoliosis. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION We systematically searched the following databases from inception to March 2017: Medline, CINAHL, Embase, SportDiscus and Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials. Selection criteria included: controlled clinical trials that compare core stabilization exercise to placebo, no treatment or another treatment in participants diagnosed with AS over 18 years old. Studies with participants presenting torso or lower extremity surgery, injection in the last six months, comorbidity that could affect the spine, red flags signs or with a history of spine trauma were excluded. We extracted information about participants, treatments, and results on pain, function and quality of life. We appraised quality using Cochrane risk of bias. We formulated level of evidence summary statements using a priori rules based on quality and consistency of results. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS We found 630 unique articles and screened the full-text of 98 articles retrieved. Only one article met all selection criteria and was included in this review. Studies were mainly excluded for study design and patient population. The included study presented a low risk of bias for all criteria except for blinding and reporting if the timing of assessments was similar between groups. The literature provides limited evidence from one study with high risk of bias that stabilization exercises in the form of 20 weeks of active self-correction, task-oriented exercises and cognitive-behavioral therapy significantly improves pain, disability and quality of life. CONCLUSIONS Despite the high prevalence of AS, there is an important gap in the literature with limited evidence reporting the effect of exercise on back pain in adults with scoliosis. This review suggest further experimental research is needed and formulates research recommendations.","Alanazi, Malik H; Parent, Eric C; Dennett, Elizabeth",European journal of physical and rehabilitation medicine,283,1

The recent COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly impacted the delivery of in-person clinical care and clinical research. We conducted an online survey of active clinician members of the Parkinson Study Group (PSG) to evaluate the adoption of various non-face-to-face methods in clinical practice and research in PD during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS We conducted a survey using the open-access online SurveyMonkey tool (http://www.surveymonkey.com). The survey had 27 items and was designed to elucidate clinical/research care before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey was sent to 414 active PSG members with weekly reminders and it remained accessible for 30 days from May 2020. RESULTS We received 142 responses, of which 133 (93.7%) provided demographic data. The clinical use of virtual visits via synchronous video conferencing increased from 39.5% pre-COVID-19 to 94.6% during the COVID-19 pandemic. Lack of access for patients (68.2%) and patient resistance (51.4%) were the top barriers for its use. Approximately 70% respondents stated that 75-100% of their research activities were suspended during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many sites had to fill out protocol deviations (38.2%), protocol exceptions (25.5%) or change their research profile due to layoffs (16.8%). The overall use of video conferencing increased from 30.3% to 64.1%. CONCLUSION The current results suggest a need for flexibility in conducting office visits and clinical trials in PD patients. Technology has the potential to enhance patient care and convenience, when in-person visits can be challenging.","Shivkumar, Vikram; Subramanian, Thyagarajan; Agarwal, Pinky; Mari, Zoltan; Mestre, Tiago A",Parkinsonism & related disorders,283,12

This study reviewed our experiences with McKeown MIEs for esophageal cancer and aimed to investigate which route was better for esophageal reconstruction. MATERIALS AND METHODS From December 2011 to December 2013, 103 patients who underwent McKeown MIE and esophageal reconstruction by PM or RS routes were reviewed. The decision regarding which approach was appropriated mainly depended on the first surgeon's preference and experience. Baseline demographics, operative, and postoperative data of the patients were analyzed. RESULTS Fifty-six and forty-seven patients receiving PM and RS route reconstruction were reviewed, respectively. Shorter operation time (P = 0.001), less blood loss (P = 0.029), and longer route length (P < 0.001) were observed in PM route compared with RS route. No difference was observed in the resection type, harvested lymph node, intensive care unit and hospital stay, postoperative complications, and in-hospital mortality between the two routes (all P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Both RS route and PM route were safe and effective. PM route was associated with shorter operation time, less blood loss, but longer route length compared with RS route.","Yang, Jingrong; Xu, Chi; Lian, Duohuang; Ye, Shixin; Zeng, Zhiyong; Liu, Daoming; Zhuang, Congwen",The Journal of surgical research,283,23

The aim of this research was to measure the incidence of postoperative delirium in patients aged 75 years or older, with the exclusion of those with preexisting neurocognitive disorders (NCD), who underwent fast-track, moderate surgery. METHODS We conducted a prospective cohort study with patients ≥ 75 years of age who were eligible for fast-track, moderate surgery, without severe dementia, with a planned hospitalization of 24 h and with a physical status varying from very fit to vulnerable. The 4-item confusion assessment method (CAM4) was used to measure delirium. RESULTS Of the 209 eligible patients, 195 subjects were enrolled in the study. The percentage of the population with a CAM4 score above 0 before surgery was 2.56%; after surgery, the percentage was 10.25%; and on the following day, the percentage was 4.61%. There was a statistically significant difference in the CAM4 scores between immediately after surgery and at 24 h after surgery (p = 0.0172). CONCLUSION The data from this study support an enhanced recovery approach for elderly patients, in which after a minor surgical procedure with anaesthesia, a recovery period of one night in the hospital can contribute to normalizing the CAM4 score and reducing the incidence of delirium.","Melegari, Gabriele; Albertini, Giovanna; Romani, Andrea; Malaguti, Silvio; Traccitto, Francesca; Giuliani, Enrico; Cavallini, Gian Maria; Bertellini, Elisabetta; Barbieri, Alberto",Aging clinical and experimental research,283,1

METHODS A literature search was performed using the following Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms and keywords: ""Prostatic Neoplasms"", ""Prostate Cancer"", ""Transurethral Resection of Prostate"", ""Prostate resection"", ""Prostate enucleation"". Meta-analysis was performed if there were two or more studies reporting the same outcome under the same definition. In case of insufficient data, results were presented in a narrative manner. RESULTS Sixty-one studies were included in qualitative synthesis and 55 were included in meta-analysis. The pooled IPCa rate was 0.08 (95% CI 0.073-0.088). Increasing age, higher preoperative serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, higher preoperative PSA density (PSAD), smaller prostate volume, higher postoperative PSA velocity and lower enucleated prostate weight, were reported to have significant correlation with IPCa. In BPH patients, the mean pre-operative and post-operative PSA levels were 5.58 ± 1.48 ng/dL and 1.06 ± 0.27 ng/dL, respectively. In patients with IPCa, the mean pre-operative and post-operative PSA levels were 7.72 ± 2.90 ng/dL and 2.77 ± 1.66 ng/dL, respectively.

Method: A 25-year-old male student was admitted to the emergency department with an acute bilateral visual loss and headaches, nausea, and cold sweats. A complete clinical and ophthalmologic examination was performed. Results: On ophthalmic examination, visual acuity (VA) was light perception in the right eye (RE) and no light perception in the left eye (LE). Pupillary examinations demonstrated dilated, non-reactive pupils. An arterial blood gas analysis showed systemic metabolic acidosis with a pH of 7.23 and Gap anion elevated. Consequently, these results were enough to provide a substantial suspicion of methanol toxicity and start the treatment. 72 hours after, he confessed that he had been inhaling methanol-based solvent for eight years. Conclusions: Methanol-induced toxicity can cause a non-reversible toxic optic neuropathy. Blood acidemia with Gap anion elevated and a suspicious fundus ophthalmic examination allows a fast diagnosis. A quick treatment based on dialysis, intravenous ethanol, sodium bicarbonate, vitamin B12, and intravenous methylprednisolone slows the secondary intoxication damages.

However, PRV infection in humans is rare and to the best of knowledge, PRV has never been isolated from human cases before. METHODS Four acute encephalitis cases in humans were confirmed as PRV infection based on clinical symptoms, laboratory diagnosis, and metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were collected and applied for virus isolation. Etiological and genetic characteristics of this PRV human isolate were further determined. RESULTS The patients manifested respiratory dysfunction and acute neurological symptoms. The mNGS revealed PRV specific nucleotide sequences in patients' CSF samples (7-6198 reads and 0.2446%-80.58% coverage). The PRV envelope glycoprotein B antibody, glycoprotein E antibody, and neutralizing antibody were positively detected. For the first time, a PRV strain, designated hSD-1/2019, was isolated and identified from one CSF sample, and transmission electron microscopy revealed hSD-1/2019 had typical morphology similar to swine PRV. Phylogenetic analysis illustrated that hSD-1/2019 was genetically closest to those PRV variant strains currently circulating in pigs in China, and this strain showed similar etiological characteristics to Chinese PRV variant strains, while different from Chinese classical strain. Moreover, hSD-1/2019 showed high pathogenicity and induced acute neurological symptoms in pigs. CONCLUSIONS A PRV strain was isolated from an acute human encephalitis case. This isolate showed close phylogenetic relationships and similar etiological characteristics to Chinese PRV variant strains, implying the great risk of PRV transmission from pigs to humans.","Liu, Qingyun; Wang, Xiaojuan; Xie, Caihua; Ding, Shifang; Yang, Hongna; Guo, Shibang; Li, Jixuan; Qin, Lingzhi; Ban, Fuguo; Wang, Dongfang; Wang, Cui; Feng, Lingxiao; Ma, Haichang; Wu, Bin; Zhang, Liping; Dong, Changxian; Xing, Li; Zhang, Jiewen; Chen, Huanchun; Yan, Ruoqian; Wang, Xiangru; Li, Wei",Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,283,33

This account clarifies the limitations and adverse effects of conflicts of interest disclosure, especially when implemented as the sole legal or policy response.

Like orthodontic tooth movement, periodontitis is associated with inflammation and alveolar bone remodelling thereby affecting orthodontic treatment. Interactions of both processes, however, are not sufficiently explored, particularly with regard to oxidative stress. METHODS After preincubation with Agac lysate for 24 h periodontal ligament fibroblasts (PDLF) were either stretched or compressed for further 48 h simulating orthodontic forces in vitro. We analysed the expression of genes and proteins involved in the formation of reactive oxygen species (NOX-4, ROS) and nitric oxide (NOS-2), inflammation (TNF, IL-6, PTGS-2) and bone remodelling (OPG, RANKL). RESULTS Agac lysate elevated the expression of NOX-4, NOS-2, inflammatory IL-6 and PTGS-2 and the bone-remodelling RANKL/OPG ratio during compressive, but not tensile mechanical strain. Agac lysate stimulated pressure-induced inflammatory signalling, whereas surprisingly ROS formation was reduced. Pressure-induced downregulation of OPG expression was inhibited by Agac lysate. CONCLUSIONS Agac lysate impact on the expression of genes and proteins involved in inflammation and bone remodelling as well as ROS formation, when PDLF were subjected to mechanical forces occurring during orthodontic tooth movement.","Schröder, Agnes; Stumpf, Julia; Paddenberg, Eva; Neubert, Patrick; Schatz, Valentin; Köstler, Josef; Jantsch, Jonathan; Deschner, James; Proff, Peter; Kirschneck, Christian",BMC oral health,283,5

METHODS In this study, we enrolled 131 patients with preoperatively diagnosed early gastric cancer who underwent LATG by a single surgeon between June 2006 and February 2014 at the Department of Surgery, Gastroenterological Center, Yokohama City University. Risk factors for anastomotic leakage (esophagojejunostomy) after LATG were retrospectively evaluated by univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS Anastomotic leakage of the esophagojejunostomy was observed in 13 (9.9%) of 131 patients. Univariate analysis of risk factors for anastomotic leakage revealed that the prognostic nutritional index (PNI) is a risk factor for anastomotic leakage (<55, 11 of 63 vs. ≥55, 2 of 55; p = 0.039). Multivariate analysis revealed that PNI is an independent risk factor for anastomotic leakage (OR 0.208; 95% CI 0.044-0.981; p = 0.047).

Recurrent infection is especially challenging, with each recurrence increasing the likelihood of a successive recurrence, leading to cycles of prolonged symptoms, frequent antimicrobial use, and decreased quality of life. Fecal microbiota transplantation to prevent recurrent infection is a promising intervention with a large effect size in observational studies, but with conflicting results from randomized controlled trials. We are conducting a Veterans Affairs-wide randomized controlled trial utilizing centralized case identification, with enrollment and fecal microbiota transplant administration occurring at the participant's home. This type of trial design significantly improves trial efficiency, greatly decreases trial cost, increases consistency of trial administration, and most importantly makes nationwide clinical trials in less-common diseases possible. METHODS This is a randomized comparison of capsule-delivered fecal microbiota transplant for the prevention of recurrent Clostridiodes difficile infection, administered after successful initial treatment of recurrent C. difficile infection with standard therapy. The primary endpoint is the incidence of recurrent C. difficile infection or death. Cases are identified by searching the Veterans Affairs Corporate Data Warehouse, with central study coordinators then reaching out to potential participants. Individuals meeting inclusion criteria and interested in participation are scheduled for in-home consent, randomization, and capsule administration, followed by telephone follow-up for 6 months. To mitigate risks of COVID-19, enrollment via video visits has been implemented. RESULTS A total of 102 participants have been enrolled through January 2021. Centralized case identification and in-home enrollment has facilitated enrollment from 34 unique states, with 38% being from rural or highly rural areas. DISCUSSION Centralized case identification and in-home enrollment is a feasible and innovative method of conducting randomized controlled trials in the Veterans Affairs system, improving access to clinical research for populations who may have difficulty engaging with the traditional model of clinical trials where enrollment is based at large hospitals in major metropolitan areas.","Drekonja, Dimitri M; Shaukat, Aasma; Zhang, Jane H; Reinink, Andrew R; Nugent, Sean; Dominitz, Jason A; Davis-Karim, Anne; Gerding, Dale N; Kyriakides, Tassos C",Clinical trials,283,16

PDMPs aim to increase patient safety by certifying that opioids are prescribed in appropriate quantities. We aimed to synthesize the literature on changes in opioid-related harms and consequences, an important measure of PDMP effectiveness. METHODS We completed a systematic review. We conducted a narrative synthesis of opioid-related harms and consequences from PDMP implementation. Outcomes were grouped into categories by theme: opioid dependence, opioid-related care outcomes, opioid-related adverse events, and opioid-related legal and crime outcomes. RESULTS We included a total of 22 studies (49 PDMPs) in our review. Two studies reported on illicit and problematic use but found no significant associations with PDMP status. Eight studies examined the association between PDMP status and opioid-related care outcomes, of which two found that treatment admissions for prescriptions opioids were lower in states with PDMP programs (p < 0.05). Of the thirteen studies that reported on opioid-related adverse events, two found significant (p < 0.001 and p < 0.05) but conflicting results with one finding a decrease in opioid-related overdose deaths after PDMP implementation and the other an increase. Lastly, two studies found no statistically significant association between PDMP status and opioid-related legal and crime outcomes (crime rates, identification of potential dealers, and diversion). CONCLUSION Our study found limited evidence to support overall associations between PDMPs and reductions in opioid-related consequences. However, this should not detract from the value of PDMPs' larger role of improving opioid prescribing.","Rhodes, Emily; Wilson, Maria; Robinson, Alysia; Hayden, Jill A; Asbridge, Mark",BMC health services research,283,16

When performing chest sonography of patients with symptoms such as respiratory infection, dyspnea and chest pain, the primary goal is to find or exclude significant diagnoses such as pneumothorax, pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, tumors, pulmonary emboli, etc. as the cause of the symptoms. If infection with SARS-CoV-2 is present, COVID-19 pneumonia can be confirmed or excluded as the cause of the symptoms with a high degree of probability based on the sonographic signs. COVID-19 pneumonia shows typical changes in the lungs, which are easily accessible to ultrasound due to their usually peripheral location. These are ubiquitous signs, such as a thickened, fragmented pleura with subpleural consolidations, multiple comet tail artifacts of varying size and thickness, some of which are coascent, broad bright light beams, and possibly small encapsulated pleural effusions. The more of these sonographic signs are present and the more pronounced they are, the sooner the patient must be hospitalized and possibly intubated. Ultrasound is also useful as a follow-up tool, together with clinical and laboratory findings.","Horn, Rudolf; Mathis, Gebhard",Praxis,283,31

METHODS A retrospective cohort study of MDR-TB patients was conducted, with positive cultures collected from cases at 13 sites. Patients with nontuberculous mycobacterial infection during anti-TB therapy were excluded. BDQ minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined using a 7H9 Middlebrook broth-based microdilution method. Mutations conferring BDQ resistance were detected via Sanger sequencing. RESULTS 277 patients receiving BDQ treatment were studied, with BDQ resistance noted in isolates from 2.2% (6/277) of MDR-TB cases, sputum conversion observed in 5 cases, and culture conversion observed in 138 cases within 2 weeks. Another 15 and 30 isolates were excluded from final analysis due to failures in obtaining subcultures and serial isolates, respectively. Of 94 cases yielding serial isolates, 11 exhibited reduced BDQ susceptibility, while 3 of 5 cases with acquired resistance failed to culture convert. Sequence analysis revealed that 6 of 11 BDQ-resistant isolates harbored Rv0678 mutations; no mutations were detected in three other BDQ resistance-associated genes. No significant intergroup difference in culture conversion time was observed. CONCLUSIONS MDR-TB patients in China exhibited a low initial BDQ resistance rate. MDR-TB cases with acquired BDQ resistance were at greater risk of treatment failure relative to initially BDQ-resistant cases. Rv0678 mutations accounted for BDQ resistance in this cohort.","Liu, Yuhong; Gao, Mengqiu; Du, Jian; Wang, Lu; Gao, Jingtao; Shu, Wei; Wang, Yufeng; Xue, Zhongtan; Li, Liang; Pang, Yu",Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,283,16

A full characterization of these activities awaits elucidation but to date it has been shown that ES-62 can inhibit pro-inflammatory/Th1 immune responses and in some studies, it has been found to actively support Th2 development. As an active filarial nematode infection is associated with a Th2-like immunological phenotype, this study investigated whether ES-62 was likely to be responsible for, or at least contribute to, this phenotype. Specifically, we determined ES-62's effect on the immune response to two other filarial nematode antigens, chosen for their ability to promote Th1 responses. The two antigens were recombinant Onchocerca volvulus-Fatty acid And Retinol-binding-1 (rOv-FAR-1) and recombinant Onchocerca volvulus-Activation associated Secreted Protein-1 (Ov-ASP-1). Overall the results show that in spite of its previously characterized immunomodulatory properties, ES-62 was unable to modulate/reverse the Th1 immune responses induced by the two Onchocerca antigens. Therefore, in this study no support is provided for the idea that ES-62 might be a major player in facilitating the overall immunological phenotype in filariasis and reasons for this somewhat surprising outcome are discussed.","Al-Riyami, L; Egan, C A; Bradley, J E; Lustigman, S; Harnett, W",Parasite immunology,283,1

PATIENTS AND METHODES According to the short-term prognosis, 81 COVID-19 patients were divided into two groups, one of worse prognosis (Group W) and the other of better prognosis (Group B). The slope of D-dimer linear regression during hospitalization (SLOPE) was calculated as an indicator of D-dimer daily continuous tendency. The SLOPE difference between Group W and Group B was compared. The difference between the discharge results and the 3-month follow-up results was also compared. COX regression analysis was used to analyze the relationship between SLOPE and short-term prognosis of COVID-19. RESULTS There were 16 patients in Group W and 65 patients in Group B. Group W had more critical proportion (p < 0.0001), indicating that the symptoms of its patients were more severe during hospitalization. ARDS, the most visible cause of worse prognosis, accounted for up to 68.75%, and many symptoms merged and resulted in worse prognosis. The D-dimer levels of Group W not only were significantly higher (p < 0.0001), but also showed an increasing trend. In addition, the D-dimer levels at discharge were significantly higher than those at follow-up (p = 0.0261), and the mean difference was as high as 0.7474. SLOPE significantly correlated with the short-term prognosis of COVID-19 independently (RR: 1.687, 95% CI: 1.345-2.116, P < 0.0001). The worst prognosis occurred most likely during the first month after COVID-19 diagnosis. CONCLUSION Our study found that D-dimer daily continuous tendency independently correlates with worse prognosis and can be used as an independent predictor of the short-term prognosis for COVID-19.","Xing, Yinting; Yang, Wei; Jin, Yingyu; Wang, Chao; Guan, Xiuru",Clinical hemorheology and microcirculation,283,27

Once inside the cell, they are activated by a series of intracellular phosphorylation steps to produce 5´-triphosphate derivatives. In many cases, nucleoside analogues are poor substrates for the cellular kinases needed for their activation. It is clear that intracellular introduction of nucleoside analogues as phosphorylated metabolites (so called pronucleotides) could circumvent difficulties associated with the use of non-phosphorylated nucleoside analogues. METHODS among the current diverse pronucleotide approaches, nucleoside phosphoramidate derivatives appear to be an interesting class of potential antiviral agents because of the known relatively low stability of the P-N bond in cellular media. On the basis of oxathiaphospholane chemistry, a series of novel conjugates of 5´-O-phosphorylated zidovudine (AZT) and stavudine (d4T) with amino acids carboxamidates were obtained. The synthesis was performed using N-(2-thiono-1,3,2-oxathiaphospholane) derivatives of amino acids carboxamides as precursors. RESULTS all synthesized compounds were studied against DNA and RNA viruses. Specific antiviral activities were only detected against HIV type-1 and HIV type-2 in MT-4 cell cultures at compound concentrations that were equally active or slightly inferior to the activity of their parent drugs (2- to 20-fold for the AZT prodrugs and 6- to 40-fold for the d4T prodrugs). The compounds were also evaluated for their anti-HIV activity in CEM and in CEM thymidine-kinase-deficient (CEM/TK(-)) cell cultures. CONCLUSIONS loss of compound antiviral potency in the CEM/TK(-) cells suggested an eventual conversion of the test compounds to the free nucleosides prior to further phosphorylation to the active 5´-triphosphate metabolite.","Kulik, Katarzyna; Radzikowska, Ewa; Kaczmarek, Renata; Baraniak, Janina; Stec, Wojciech J; De Clercq, Erik; Balzarini, Jan; Pannecouque, Christophe",Antiviral chemistry & chemotherapy,283,15

However, this recommendation is questionable for its perioperative use. Several recent randomised controlled studies do not indicate a risk for renal failure-not even after high-risk surgery. Human albumin is used in our neurointensive care unit as a part of the ""Lund concept"" of brain injury resuscitation, and albumin has been introduced in elective neurosurgery instead of starch. The aim of our prospective unblinded observational cohort study was to compare the degree of dilutive coagulopathy after albumin and starch intra-operative fluid therapy. METHODS Thirty-nine patients undergoing elective brain tumour surgery with craniotomy received either 130/0.42 hydroxyethyl starch or 5 % albumin infusions. The first 18 patients received starch, whereas the rest received albumin. Rotational thromboelastometry with ROTEM and platelet aggregometry with Multiplate were performed before surgery, after the first and second consecutive colloid infusions (250/500 ml albumin or 500/1000 ml starch) and at the end of surgery. RESULTS Both intra- and inter-group comparisons showed more deranged ROTEM parameters after the higher doses of starch. Multiplate detected changes only in the albumin group after 500-ml infusion. Blood los did not differ between groups, nor did haemoglobin preoperatively or at end of surgery. Lower volumes of albumin were required to maintain stable intra-operative haemodynamic parameters; 250/500 ml albumin corresponded to 500/1000 ml starch. CONCLUSIONS Hydroxyethyl starch affected coagulation at lower volumes, with a more prominent effect on clot structure at the end of surgery, corroborating previous research. Only albumin decreased platelet aggregation, and 5 % albumin had a more potential volume effect than 130/0.42 hydroxyethyl starch.","Li, N; Statkevicius, S; Asgeirsson, B; Schött, U",Perioperative medicine,283,12

CoVs infect various organs including respiratory and enteric systems, as exemplified by the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2. The constellation of viral factors that contribute to developing enteric disease remains elusive. Here, we investigated CoV interferon antagonists for their contribution to enteric pathogenesis. Using an infectious clone of an enteric CoV, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (icPEDV), we generated viruses with inactive versions of interferon antagonist nonstructural proteins 1, 15, and 16 individually, or combined in one virus designated icPEDV-mut4. Interferon-responsive PK1 cells were infected with these viruses and produced higher levels of interferon responses, as compared to wild-type icPEDV infection. icPEDV-mut4 elicited robust interferon responses and was severely impaired for replication in PK1 cells. To evaluate viral pathogenesis, piglets were infected with either icPEDV or icPEDV-mut4. While the icPEDV-infected piglets exhibited clinical disease, the icPEDV-mut4-infected piglets showed no clinical symptoms and exhibited normal intestinal pathology at day 2 post-infection. The icPEDV-mut4 replicated in the intestinal tract, as revealed by detection of viral RNA in fecal swabs, with sequence analysis documenting genetic stability of the input strain. Importantly, icPEDV-mut4 infection elicited IgG and neutralizing antibody responses to PEDV. These results identify nsp1, nsp15, and nsp16 as virulence factors that contribute to the development of PEDV-induced diarrhea in swine. Inactivating these CoV interferon antagonists is a rational approach for generating candidate vaccines to prevent disease and spread of enteric CoVs, including SARS-CoV-2.Author summary Emerging coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and porcine CoVs, can infect enterocytes, cause diarrhea, and be shed in the feces. New approaches are needed to understand enteric pathogenesis and develop vaccines and therapeutics to prevent the spread of these viruses. Here, we exploit a reverse genetic system for an enteric CoV, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), and outline an approach of genetically inactivating highly conserved viral factors known to limit the host innate immune response to infection. Our study reveals that generating PEDV with inactive versions of three viral interferon antagonists, nonstructural proteins 1, 15 and 16, results in a highly attenuated virus that does not cause diarrhea in animals, and elicits a neutralizing antibody response in virus-infected animals. This strategy may be useful for generating live-attenuated vaccine candidates that prevent disease and fecal spread of enteric CoVs, including SARS-CoV-2.","Deng, Xufang; Buckley, Alexandra C; Pillatzki, Angela; Lager, Kelly M; Faaberg, Kay S; Baker, Susan C",Journal of virology,283,11

Dynamic monitoring of RN strain could identify when intervention is needed, but comprehensive views of RN work demands are not readily available. Electronic care delivery tools such as nurse call systems produce ambient data that illuminate workplace activity, but little is known about the ability of these data to predict RN strain. OBJECTIVES The purpose of this study was to assess the utility of ambient workplace data, defined as time-stamped transaction records and log file data produced by non-electronic health record care delivery tools (e.g., nurse call systems, communication devices), as an information channel for automated sensing of RN strain. METHODS In this exploratory retrospective study, ambient data for a 1-year time period were exported from electronic nurse call, medication dispensing, time and attendance, and staff communication systems. Feature sets were derived from these data for supervised machine learning models that classified work shifts by unplanned overtime. Models for three timeframes -8, 10, and 12 hours-were created to assess each model's ability to predict unplanned overtime at various points across the work shift. RESULTS Classification accuracy ranged from 57 to 64% across three analysis timeframes. Accuracy was lowest at 10 hours and highest at shift end. Features with the highest importance include minutes spent using a communication device and percent of medications delivered via a syringe. CONCLUSION Ambient data streams can serve as information channels that contain signals related to unplanned overtime as a proxy indicator of RN strain as early as 8 hours into a work shift. This study represents an initial step toward enhanced detection of RN strain and proactive prevention of missed or delayed patient care.","Womack, Dana M; Hribar, Michelle R; Steege, Linsey M; Vuckovic, Nancy H; Eldredge, Deborah H; Gorman, Paul N",Applied clinical informatics,283,1

Among 1519 records, we identified nine prospective studies (n = 5214) and 17 cross-sectional eligible studies (n = 7309), with most enrolling high CVD risk populations in Asia. All nine prospective studies investigated composite CVD events as an outcome (498 cases including coronary events and stroke) but modeled CAVI inconsistently.

Furthermore, there is no evidence that the market efficiency of globally listed private equity markets has improved after the global financial crisis. Due to the fact that the rapidly growing asset class of LPE as a form of private equity is still relatively unknown, the implications of the results of our paper are relevant for investors, policy makers, and academics alike. In addition, the results provide valuable insights to better understand the emerging asset class of LPE.","Tegtmeier, Lars",Journal of Risk and Financial Management,283,24

Extended water age in premise plumbing greatly increases the risk of opportunistic premise plumbing pathogens. This review critically analyses the chemical and physical parameters that influence the occurrence of opportunistic pathogens in the drinking water distribution system, specifically in premise plumbing. A comprehensive literature review reveals significant impacts of water age, disinfectant residual (type and concentration), temperature, pH, and pipe materials. Evidence suggests that there is substantial interplay between these parameters;however, the dynamics of such relationships is yet to be elucidated. There is a correlation between premise plumbing system characteristics, including those featuring water and energy conservation measures, and increased water quality issues and public health concerns. Other interconnected issues exacerbated by high water age, such as disinfectant decay and reduced corrosion control efficiency, deserve closer attention. Some common features and trends in the occurrence of opportunistic pathogens have been identified through a thorough analysis of the available literature. It is proposed that the efforts to reduce or eliminate their incidence might best focus on these common features.","Leslie, E.; Hinds, J.; Hai, F. I.",Applied Sciences-Basel,283,20

However, the role of VM and its integration as part of the WLC in a construction project remain reactive, and highly impacted by nature of the project, and this has become more challenging with the epidemic impact of COVID-19. This research aims to investigate the mechanisms that delivers value management as part of the “re-invent” strategy proposed by the Construction Leadership Council in the UK government to improve WLC for buildings. In addition to existing secondary data from the literature, primary data were attained using a focus group with six quantity surveyors from different cost consultancies in the UK to gather qualitative evidence using their experiences, perceptions, and key challenges they face when integrating VM. Findings revealed that value management is primarily being used as a cost-cutting tool, the majority of quantity surveyors lack knowledge of what it encompasses, hence the industry needs a more proactive strategy towards it. Analysis revealed that value management is primarily implemented as a cost-cutting solution, key stakeholders (e.g., facility managers) need to be integrated, and there is no standardised process to incorporate value management in projects. The study proposes a four-dimensional (governance and policies, sustainability, industry’s best practice, and innovation and technology) strategy to facilitate more holistic considerations of value management post COVID-19. Future work looks into evaluating the strategy proposed while acknowledging different procurement routes.","Bennett, Kieran Mayouf Mohammad",Sustainability,283,1

The 1st and 3rd laws receive the bulk of attention; the 1st law because of the paradigm shift significance in overhauling the previous circular models with epicycles of both Ptolemy and Copernicus, the 3rd because of its convenience to the standard curriculum in having a simple mathematical statement that allows for quantitative homework assignments and exams. In this work I advance a method for teaching the 2nd law that combines the paradigm-shift significance of the 1st and the mathematical proclivity of the 3rd. The approach is rooted in the historical method, indeed, placed in its historical context, Kepler's 2nd is as revolutionary as the 1st: as the 1st law does away with the epicycle, the 2nd law does away with the equant. This way of teaching the 2nd law also formulates the""time=area""statement quantitatively, in the way of Kepler's equation, M = E - e sin E (relating mean anomaly M, eccentric anomaly E, and eccentricity e), where the left-hand side is time and the right-hand side is area. In doing so, it naturally paves the way to finishing the module with an active learning computational exercise, for instance, to calculate the timing and location of Mars' next opposition. This method is partially based on Kepler's original thought, and should thus best be applied to research-oriented students, such as junior and senior physics/astronomy undergraduates, or graduate students.","Lyra, Wladimir",,283,10

Thus far, most investigators have used transgenic mice expressing the human ACE2 in epithelial cells (K18-hACE2 transgenic mice) that are intranasally instilled with a liquid SARS-CoV-2 suspension under deep anesthesia. Unfortunately, this experimental approach results in disproportionate high CNS infection leading to fatal encephalitis, which is rarely observed in humans and severely limits this model’s usefulness. Here, we describe the use of an inhalation tower system that allows exposure of unanesthetized mice to aerosolized virus under controlled conditions. Aerosol exposure of K18-hACE2 transgenic mice to SARS-CoV-2 resulted in robust viral replication in the respiratory tract, anosmia, and airway obstruction, but did not lead to fatal viral neuroinvasion. When compared to intranasal inoculation, aerosol infection resulted in a more pronounced lung pathology including increased immune infiltration, fibrin deposition and a transcriptional signature comparable to that observed in SARS-CoV-2- infected patients.

There is uncertainty regarding risks of virus aerosolization and laparoscopic surgery. This narrative review discusses these concerns of virus exposure and transmission for health care workers in the operating room by summarizing currently available recommendations and describing our institution's experience. Our virology review was performed by compiling published data on various viruses' presence in blood, peritoneal fluid and surgical smoke. Our recommendations review was performed by researching official organizational guidelines and medical archives (medRxiv) pre-prints. SARS-CoV-2 is mainly transmitted via respiratory droplets. Previous studies have demonstrated the ability of other viruses to form aerosol particles in peritoneal fluid and surgical smoke. Aerosol-generating medical procedures (AGMPs) are considered important risks for nosocomial transmission of viruses, but there is no consensus to include all surgical procedures as so. Most local and international organizations highlight the concerns surrounding laparoscopy, but are not strictly discouraging this modality. They recommend proceeding with caution to minimize surgical smoke exposure by ensuring the use of filtration systems, tight air-seals and fewer incisions. We can extrapolate from other viruses that SARS-CoV-2 may present a potential infectious risk in the operating room. Until evidence arises otherwise, we recommend considering all surgical procedures to be aerosolizing. Laparoscopy continues to be a safe and appropriate modality. Full airborne personal protective equipment (PPE) should be utilized in all emergent cases, and droplet PPE only in urgent elective cases for asymptomatic, screen- and test-negative patients.","Huynh, C.; Duncan, K.; Ramkumar, J.; Scott, T.

The article presents the results of polling students and professors of universities of Kazan, Magnitogorsk, Penza, and Ryazan. The respondents were over 100 students and 40 professors. The research showed that 67% of students and 91.7% of professors believe that higher education cannot be completely transferred into the online format. The professors consider a combination of online and offline regimes to be an optimal form of learning. The polling allowed evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of organization and content of distance learning at the local level, the difficulties and problems for professors and students, and the prospects of the phenomenon under study. The first and foremost of them is the insufficient preparedness of the professors and students for transiting to the distance learning regime. Many organizational problems were due to an unstable functioning of the digital educational environment, educational portals, and information-communication networks. The research showed that interaction between professors and students should be made more efficient. In general, both students and professors acknowledge that distance learning complements the existing traditional educational system and only certain forms of teaching can work in distant format. In this regard, the full transition of the Russian universities to distance format in spring 2020 is a forced necessity caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Vagaeva, O.

Yet, inclusion of pregnant women is of interest in vaccinology including during health crisis. Promotion of clinical trials by midwives may facilitate the decision making of pregnant women. Attitudes of midwives about participation in a vaccine clinical trial have been little explored. Methods: We conducted an anonymous survey from the 11th of September to the 11th of November 2020. Primary endpoint was the willingness to encourage pregnant women to participate in a hypothetical respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine clinical trial. Results: Among 398 midwives who answered the questionnaire, 113 (28.3 %) were likely to encourage pregnant women to participate in the vaccine clinical trial, this proportion ranged from 25 % in senior midwives to 34.5 % among the students. After adjustment on age, parenthood, previous vaccine hesitancy attitudes, and the 5 components of the 5C model, the only predictor of the promotion of the clinical trial was the training score with an adjusted odds ratio of 1.09 (1.01-1.18, p=0.027) for a one-point increase. Vaccine hesitancy and psychological antecedents of vaccinations were not associated with a lower promotion of pregnant women trial participation among midwives. Conclusion: Few respondents were likely to encourage pregnant women to participate in a vaccine clinical trial. Midwives who considered having a good training about vaccines were more prone to encourage pregnant women to participate in a RSV vaccine clinical trial.","Gagneux-Brunon, A.; Guyot, E.; Detoc, M.; Botelho-Nevers, E.; Barjat, T.",,283,24

Inflammatory tumor microenvironment leads to T cell exhaustion in multiple myeloma leading to treatment failure and relapse. Specifically, T cell based therapies including bispecific antibodies and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell are associated with the additional side effects of non-specific T cell activation and cytokine release syndrome. Adoptive therapy with allogeneic cord blood (CB) T regulatory (Treg) cell therapy has been shown to be safe with clinical efficacy in a wide range of diseases including graft vs. host disease (GvHD), inflammatory bone marrow failures and COVID-19 induced acute respiratory distress syndrome. Furthermore, combination of Tregs with donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) has led to resolution of leukemia relapse without GvHD flare up. We hypothesize that co-administration of Tregs with adoptive T cell based therapy will improve myeloma outcomes. Methods. 3x106 GFP-labeled MM.1S cells were injected into NSG mice followed by 5x106 CD3+ T conventional (Tcon) cells on day 14. In a subset of the Tcon treated mice, 1x107 CB Treg cells were injected on day 47, 54 and 61. Mice were followed every other day for weight and GvHD score. Non-invasive bioluminescent imaging (BLI) was performed serially. Weekly blood draw was performed for cell analysis and cytokine assays. At the time of euthanasia, blood, spleen and bone marrow were harvested for histopathology and flow analysis. In a subsequent experiment, intra-peritoneal injection of the bi-specific antibody against CD3 and BCMA (BCMA-BiTE) was administered in the xenogenic myeloma model in the presence or absence of CB Treg cells. Pan T cells were injected into all mice to facilitate the anti-tumor action of BiTE. Results. Both Tcon and Tcon+Treg recipients maintained their body weight compared to myeloma alone or myeloma + Treg arm (Figure A). All mice showed evidence of tumor growth by day 20 (Figure A). Widespread MM.1S cell growth in the myeloma only mice at day 27 was demonstrated by BLI whereas no measurable tumor growth was evident in Tcon recipients or Tcon+Treg recipients. By day 69, Tcon only mice were significantly increased tumor growth compared to Tcon+Treg recipients (Figure B). While circulating multiple myeloma cells were detected in myeloma alone and myeloma+Treg arm, no such evidence was detectable in the Tcon or Tcon+Treg recipients. However, upon euthanasia, extramedullary relapse of myeloma as retroperitoneal mass was detected in Tcon recipient (Figure C). Addition of Treg + BiTE led to a similar degree of tumor control compared to BiTE alone treated mice, however, a significant weight loss was observed in this arm (Figure D) with a corresponding high GvHD score (Figure E). Furthermore, addition of CB Treg cells led to decrease of T cell exhaustion phenotypic markers (data not shown). Conclusion. We are the first to show that CB Treg cells can be administered in combination with the T-cell based immunotherapies directed against myeloma. Such a strategy should be examined in the clinical setting. [Formula presented] Disclosures: Nishimoto: Bayer Yakuhin, Ltd:: Research Funding;Janssen Pharmaceutical K.K.:: Research Funding.

Several studies have reported that the amount of time an individual experiencing symptoms of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) spends at home a day (i.e., home stay), as well as various mobility related metrics, are associated with symptom severity in MDD. Due to the use of small and homogeneous cohorts of participants, it is uncertain whether the findings reported in those studies generalize to a broader population of individuals with the MDD symptoms. In the present study, we examined the relationship between overall severity of the depressive symptoms, as assessed by the eight-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ - 8), and median daily home stay over the two weeks preceding the completion of a questionnaire in individuals with MDD. We used questionnaire and geolocation data of 164 participants collected in the observational Remote Assessment of Disease and Relapse - Major Depressive Disorder (RADAR - MDD) study. Participant age and severity of the MDD symptoms were found to be significantly related to home stay, with older and more severely affected individuals spending more time at home. The association between home stay and symptom severity appeared to be stronger on weekdays than on weekends. Furthermore, we found a significant modulation of home stay by occupational status, with employment reducing home stay. Our findings suggest that home stay is associated with symptom severity in MDD and demonstrate the importance of accounting for confounding factors in future MDD studies.","Laiou, P.; Kaliukhovich, D.

Children are among the most vulnerable group to suffer from these health impacts. Parents as caregivers play a particularly important role in protecting them adequately. Objectives: The aim of the study was to investigate how parents perceive the health consequences of climate change. Of particular interest were their information status and already used communication channels, to make them more addressable. In addition, their risk perception and relevance estimation of the health consequences of climate change for their children were investigated. Methods: Parents were able to participate anonymously in the study from March to June 2020 by means of an online questionnaire. The study sample consisted of 292 parents living in Germany (age: M = 42.02; SD = 7.73; sex: [female] = 190; [male] = 54) with at least one child aged 0 to 18 years. Open-ended questions and closed-ended questions with Likert scales were used. Data were analyzed descriptively. Correlations and regression analysis were performed. Findings: About 75% of the respondents knew at least one health consequence of climate change. Heat related illnesses were named as the most important health consequences (74.1%). Parents obtain most of their information from the Internet (73.3%). The increase of air pollutants is estimated as the most relevant risk for the health of their children. Relevance estimation affects risk perception. Conclusion: Parents are aware of the importance of being informed about the health consequences of climate change. Therefore, knowledge about the health consequences in relation to the relevance assessment must be communicated clearly and sufficiently. Information channels already used should be improved and further multipliers identified.","Lagally, L.; Schorlemmer, J.; Schoierer, J.; Edlinger, M.; Boese-O'Reilly, S.",,283,1

Recent World Health Organization guidelines on tuberculosis infection prevention and control (IPC) recommend a range of measures to reduce transmission in healthcare and institutional settings. These were evaluated primarily based on evidence for their effects on transmission to healthcare workers in hospitals. To estimate the overall impact of IPC interventions, it is necessary to also consider their impact on overall community-wide tuberculosis incidence and mortality. Methods We developed an individual-based model of Mtb transmission between household members, in primary healthcare clinics (PHCs), and in other congregate settings; drug sensitive and multidrug resistant tuberculosis disease development and resolution; and HIV and antiretroviral therapy (ART) and their effects on tuberculosis. The model was parameterised using data from a high HIV prevalence, rural/peri-urban community in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, including data on social contact in clinics and other settings by sex, age group, and HIV/ART status; and data on the prevalence of tuberculosis in clinic attendees and the general population. We estimated the proportion of disease in adults that resulted from transmission in PHC clinics in 2019, and the impact of a range of IPC interventions in clinics on community-wide TB incidence and mortality. Results We estimate that 7.6% (plausible range 3.9-13.9%) of drug sensitive and multidrug resistant tuberculosis in adults resulted from transmission in PHC clinics in the study community in 2019. The proportion is higher in HIV-positive people, at 9.3% (4.8%-16.8%), compared to 5.3% (2.7%-10.1%) in HIV-negative people. We estimate that IPC interventions could reduce the number of incident TB cases in the community in 2021-2030 by 3.4-8.0%, and the number of deaths by 3.0-7.2%. Conclusions A non-trivial proportion of tuberculosis results from transmission in PHC clinics in the study communities, particularly in HIV-positive people. Implementing IPC interventions could lead to moderate reductions in disease burden. We therefore recommend that IPC measures in clinics should be implemented both for their benefits to staff and patients, but also for their likely effects on TB incidence and mortality in the surrounding community.","McCreesh, N.; Karat, A.

Normally, the model is used to investigate non-pharmaceutical interventions. In the present paper, we undertake steps to better understand the infection graph. It becomes clear that the typical infection graph representation that connects individual people is an even more expensive representation than our original, already expensive data-driven mobility model.

The novelty of the research lies in two main aspects: (1) the necessity to revise the traditional concept of motivation caused by the pandemic and (2) own methodological approach. While the first aspect reflects the lack of appropriate scientific attention paid to this issue, the second aspect develops methodological approaches applied so far in the research of intrinsic motivation sources. The goal of the paper has been achieved via own questionnaire research of the traditional quadratic structure of the intrinsic motivation sources of employees. The data from socio-demographically representative sample of 2000 respondents have been in accordance with contemporary trends in managerial analytics analysed via factor analysis and relevant statistic tests. It has been found that the ranking of intrinsic motivation sources before the COVID-19 pandemic was the following: (1) sense of choice;(2) sense of meaningfulness;(3) sense of progress and (4) sense of competence. The ranking of intrinsic motivation sources during the COVID-19 pandemic was the following: (1) sense of choice;(2) sense of progress;(3) sense of meaningfulness;and (4) sense of competence. Based on the identified changes in intrinsic motivation sources and their components, it can be stated that the pandemic has significantly influenced the existing principles and patterns of internal marketing communication. These should be critically reconsidered, and motivation systems should be revised to contribute to the optimal performance of the company on the market and its sustainable development by focusing on the financial situation of the company, significant for the economic pillar;the change in individual value scales, significant for the environmental pillar;and the phenomenon of millennials, significant for the social pillar.

Vocal and facial measurements were assessed in relation to schizophrenia symptom severity and functional impairment as it relates to work status. Results: Vocal markers including speech prevalence, vocal jitter, fundamental frequency, and vocal intensity demonstrated specificity as markers of negative symptom severity while measurement of facial expressivity demonstrated itself as a robust marker of overall schizophrenia severity.

Iceland is considering building its first wind farms, but its landscape and nature are not only a resource for renewable energy production;they are also the main attraction for tourists. As wind turbines affect how the landscape is perceived and experienced, it is foreseeable that the construction of wind farms in Iceland will create land use conflicts between the energy sector and the tourism industry. This study sheds light on the impacts of wind farms on nature-based tourism as perceived by the tourism industry. Based on 47 semi-structured interviews with tourism service providers, it revealed that the impacts were perceived as mostly negative, since wind farms decrease the quality of the natural landscape. Furthermore, the study identified that the tourism industry considered the following as key factors for selecting suitable wind farm sites: the visibility of wind turbines, the number of tourists and tourist attractions in the area, the area’s degree of naturalness and the local need for energy. The research highlights the importance of analysing the various stakeholders’ opinions with the aim of mitigating land use conflicts and socioeconomic issues related to wind energy development.","Wendt, Margrét Tverijonaite Edita",Land,283,1

In this study, we aimed to evaluate the extent of attention deficits, one of the commonly affected cognitive domains, among breast cancer patients treated with different chemotherapy regimens through neuroimaging techniques. Methods: Breast cancer patients treated with two commonly prescribed chemotherapy regimens, AC-T and TAC, and healthy volunteers were recruited. Near-infrared hemoencephalography (nirHEG) and quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) assessments were recorded for each participant at rest and during task performance to compare the functional cortical changes associated with each chemotherapy regimen. Results: The qEEG analysis revealed increased power of high alpha/low beta or sensorimotor rhythm (SMR) frequency in left fronto-centro-parietal regions involved in dorsal and ventral attention networks (DAN and VAN) in the AC-T-treated group comparing to the TAC and control group. The AC-T group also had the highest current source density (CSD) values in DAN and VAN-related centers in 10 and 15 Hz associated with the lowest Z-scored FFT coherence in the mentioned regions. Conclusions: The mentioned findings revealed increased cognitive workload and lack of cognitive ease in breast cancer patients treated with the AC-T regimen proposing the presumable neurotoxic sequelae of this chemotherapy regimen in comparison with the TAC regimen.","Vasaghi Gharamaleki, M.; Mousavi, S.

As the country was experiencing the onset of the first wave of COVID-19 in late February 2020, the majority coalition, the Alliance of Hope (Pakatan Harapan) that formed the federal government at the time broke apart due to defections, symbolized by the so-called Sheraton Move. A new government led by the National Alliance (Perikatan Nasional, PN) coalition came into power after the king appointed its leader, Muhyiddin Yassin, prime minister, replacing Mahathir Mohamad. The PN government immediately faced two severe challenges: the global pandemic threat and the crisis of legitimacy due to weak coalition building. This article mainly focuses on the second challenge, namely the ways the PN government has been able to avoid a parliamentary vote of no confidence and keep its coalition intact, albeit precariously. © 2021 by The Regents of the University of California.","Tayeb, A.",Asian Survey,283,16

An approach to appealing to URMs involves preexisting in-person strategies but also adapting virtual tools to promote inclusion. Specifically, program websites serve as the first impressions of a program, as well as influence the perception of diversity and inclusion. We evaluated the content and diversity representation of HO program websites to facilitate a generally more informed and URM-considerate recruitment. Methods: The websites of 2019-2020 ACGME accredited HO programs were assessed between June 1st to July 1st, 2020. Data focused on 30 informational categories, derived from published methodology, along with three additional categories concerning diversity, based on suggestions for inclusive graduate medical education recruitment strategies, were compared using two-tailed t tests. We defined websites with 70% or more of the 30 informational categories as 'comprehensive websites.' Affiliation with a National Cancer Institute (NCI) Designated Cancer Center, NCI Designated Cancer Center + National Cancer Center Network (NCCN) member institution, and a top 50 ranked cancer hospital by U.S. News was also considered in the analysis. Results: A total of 156 program websites were analyzed: 37.2% NCI;19.9% NCCN;29.5% U.S. News ranked. Only 31 (19.9%) were 'comprehensive websites,' and 34 (21.8%) had information pertaining to at least one of the diversity categories. There was a significant association between inclusion of diversity content and being a 'comprehensive website' (p = 0.001). Compared to those that were neither designated nor ranked, programs designated by NCI, NCCN, or ranked by U.S. News were more likely to have more complete information available (p &lt; 0.001, = 0.008, and &lt; 0.001, respectively). However, only programs ranked by U.S. News were more likely to include information about diversity on their websites (p = 0.006). Conclusions: The vast majority of HO fellowship program websites were not comprehensive, including a lack of diversity and inclusivity content. NCI designation, NCCN participation, and US News ranking were significantly associated with more complete fellowship websites. Given the context of the COVID-19 pandemic in which institution visitation is restricted, program websites may have elevated importance in recruitment. HO programs should direct resources to offering more complete and inclusive websites to better inform applicants, including URM residents.","Muthiah, A.; Aggarwal, V.; Wei, C.; Muthiah, C.; Quesenberry, M.

Receiving a score for most PSIs requires a minimum number of qualifying cases, which are partly determined by whether the associated diagnosis-related group (DRG) was surgical and whether the surgery was elective. While these criteria can exempt hospitals from PSIs, it remains to be seen whether exemption is driven by low volume, small numbers of DRGs, or perhaps, policies that determine how procedures are classified as elective. Methods: Using Medicare inpatient claims data from 4,069 hospitals between 2015 and 2017, we examined how percentages of elective procedures relate to numbers of surgical claims and surgical DRGs. We used a combination of quantile regression and machine learning based anomaly detection to characterize these relationships and identify outliers. We then used a set of machine learning algorithms to test whether outliers were explained by the DRGs they reported. Results: Average percentages of elective procedures generally decreased from 100% to 60% in relation to the number of surgical claims and the number of DRGs among them. Some providers with high volumes of claims had anomalously low percentages of elective procedures (5% to 40%). These low elective outliers were not explained by the particular surgical DRGs among their claims. However, among hospitals exempted from PSIs, those with the greatest volume of claims were always low elective outliers. Conclusion: Some hospitals with relatively high numbers of surgical claims may have classified procedures as non-elective in a way that ultimately exempted them from certain PSIs.","Locey, K.

At the zero lower bound on deposit rates (ZLBD), changes in policy rates affect activity through both real interest rates and banks’ net interest margins (NIMs). At empirically plausible credit supply elasticities, the Phillips curve is very flat at the ZLBD. This is because inflation increases NIMs, credit, deposits, and thereby output, while higher NIMs also dampen inflation by relaxing price setters’ credit rationing constraint. At the ZLBD, monetary policy has far larger effects on output relative to inflation, and inflation feedback rules stabilize output less effectively than rules that also respond to credit. For post-COVID-19 policy, this suggests urgency in returning inflation to targets, caution with negative policy rates, and a strong influence of credit conditions on rate setting.","Kumhof, Michael Wang Xuan",Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control,283,25

Gait analysis can therefore be used to detect impairments and help diagnose illnesses and assess patient recovery. Using vision-based systems, diagnoses could be done at home or in a clinic, with the needed computation being done remotely. State-of-the-art vision-based gait analysis systems use deep learning, requiring large datasets for training. However, to our best knowledge, the biggest publicly available pathological gait dataset contains only 10 subjects, simulating 4 gait pathologies. This paper presents a new dataset called GAIT-IT, captured from 21 subjects simulating 4 gait pathologies, with 2 severity levels, besides normal gait, being considerably larger than publicly available gait pathology datasets, allowing to train a deep learning model for gait pathology classification. Moreover, it was recorded in a professional studio, making it possible to obtain nearly perfect silhouettes, free of segmentation errors. Recognizing the importance of remote healthcare, this paper proposes a prototype of a web application allowing to upload a walking person's video, possibly acquired using a smartphone camera, and execute a web service that classifies the person's gait as normal or across different pathologies. The web application has a user friendly interface and could be used by healthcare professionals or other end users. An automatic gait analysis system is also developed and integrated with the web application for pathology classification. Compared to state-of-the-art solutions, it achieves a drastic reduction in the number of model parameters, which means significantly lower memory requirements, as well as lower training and execution times. Classification accuracy is on par with the state-of-the-art.","Albuquerque, Pedro; Machado, Joao; Verlekar, Tanmay Tulsidas; Soares, Luis Ducla; Correia, Paulo Lobato",,283,17

In addition to receiving standard treatment appropriate to the state of health at the time of the operation, a group of birds were treated with a single dose of ivermectin administered subcutaneously (0.2 mL of a 1% solution equivalent to 200 µg/kg body weight), with a group of control birds not receiving the treatment being reserved. The results showed a remarkable recovery of symptoms after 24 hours of treatment among the birds that received ivermectin. At 4 days after treatment, the birds that received ivermectin showed visibly greater mobility and vivacity, as well as a recovery in egg production. PCR tests after 4 days of treatment with ivermectin were negative for NDV and ILTV. These results are interesting and suggest a possible effect of ivermectin against NDV and ILTV in birds. More controlled studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis.","Fernandez-Díaz, Manolo; Guevara, Luis; Icochea, Eliana; Montalván, Angela; Villanueva-Pérez, Doris; Fernandez-Sánchez, Manolo; Ticona, Julio; Zimic, Mirko",bioRxiv,283,16

To overcome this shortage, we propose toxic intermediates and their controlling enzymes in metabolic pathways as a resource for new targets and provide a web-service, FunTox-Networks to explore the landscape of toxic intermediates in the metabolic networks of fungal pathogens. The toxicity of metabolites is predicted by a new random forest regression model and is available for over one hundred fungal species. Further, for major fungal pathogens, metabolic networks from the KEGG database were enriched with data of toxicity and regulatory effort for each enzyme to support identification of targets. We determined several toxic intermediates in fungal-specific pathways like amino acid synthesis, nitrogen and sulfur assimilation, and the glyoxylate bypass. For the latter, we show experimentally that growth of the pathogen Candida albicans is inhibited when the detoxifying enzymes Mls1 and Hbr2 are deleted and toxic glyoxylate accumulates in the cell. Thus, toxic pathway intermediates and their controlling enzymes represent an untapped resource of antifungal targets.","Ewald, Jan; Jansen, Paul Mathias; Brunke, Sascha; Hiller, Davina; Luther, Christian H.; González-Díaz, Humbert; Dittrich, Marcus T.; Fleißner, André; Hube, Bernhard; Schuster, Stefan; Kaleta, Christoph",bioRxiv,283,1

However, determining microbiomes diversity implies the classification of taxa composition within the sampled community, which is often done via the assignment of individual reads to taxa by comparison to reference databases. Although computational methods aimed at identifying the microbe(s) taxa are available, it is well known that inferences using different methods can vary widely depending on various biases. In this study, we first apply and compare different bioinformatics methods based on 16S ribosomal RNA gene and whole genome shotgun sequencing for taxonomic classification to three small mock communities of bacteria, of which the compositions are known. We show that none of these methods can infer both the true number of taxa and their abundances. We thus propose a novel approach, named Core-Kaiju, which combines the power of shotgun metagenomics data with a more focused marker gene classification method similar to 16S, but based on emergent statistics of core protein domain families. We thus test the proposed method on the three small mock communities and also on medium- and highly complex mock community datasets taken from the Critical Assessment of Metagenome Interpretation challenge. We show that Core-Kaiju reliably predicts both number of taxa and abundance of the analysed mock bacterial communities. Finally we apply our method on human gut samples, showing how Core-Kaiju may give more accurate ecological characterization and fresh view on real microbiomes.","Tovo, Anna; Menzel, Peter; Krogh, Anders; Lagomarsino, Marco Cosentino; Suweis, Samir",bioRxiv,283,20

The clinical signs and symptoms and the disease severity in people infected with COVID-19 can be varied. The present study was conducted to study the biomarker profile and their association with disease severity in COVID-19. Materials and Methods: This was a single-centre Cohort study of data regarding epidemiological, clinical and biomarker parameters, and outcome of COVID-19 patients admitted in a tertiary care hospital in South India. CDC guidelines were followed for assessing disease severity. Results: A total of 336 COVID-19 patients were admitted during the study period. Of these 16 were excluded and 320 cases were analysed. Mean age of patients was 44.82 years. A male predominance was observed. Diabetes mellitus was the most common co-morbidity. Asymptomatic, Mild, moderate, severe and critical disease was seen in 15%, 52.5%, 20.3%, 6.3% and 5.9% patients respectively. ICU care was required in 15.3%. Overall mortality was 5.3%.

They were members of different police departments, and the epidemic-related activities became part of their everyday tasks, so they had colourful experiences. In the research we used a 14 question survey form compiled by us. The query happened online during the period of their professional examinations (the end of May - the beginning of June 2020);we got 28 answered questions about the experiences of policing the pandemic. The results showed that the tasks were checking official home quarantine, duty at border crossing points and duty on public places related to the lockdown. The vast majority of the interviewed (85.7 per cent) did not feel these tasks emotionally overwhelming, while a little bigger part of them rated the duties physically overwhelming (28.6 per cent). We asked about their fears, too. The most intense fear was the infection of their family members, it was followed by infecting others and the infection of colleagues, but they did not feel intense fear about becoming infected. Based on the results, we can probably say that the first two months of policing the pandemic did not mean extreme psychological overload. Although the results are not representative, they can be a starting point for further research of the theme - especially because the autumn pandemic is more stressful for everyone both psychologically and physically.","Zsuzsanna, Borbély",Magyar Rendeszet,283,24

We validate our music-based sentiment measure by correlating it with mood swings induced by seasonal factors, weather conditions, and COVID-related restrictions. We find that music sentiment is positively correlated with same-week equity market returns and negatively correlated with next-week returns, consistent with sentiment-induced temporary mispricing. Results also hold under a daily analysis and are stronger when trading restrictions limit arbitrage.

While this provides advantages for employees and businesses, it also leads to a multitude of shortcomings, most prevalent of which is the emergence of additional security risks. Previous to the outbreak, company computer networks were mainly confined within its facilities. The pandemic has now caused this network to “spread thin,” as the majority of employees work remotely. This has opened up a variety of new vulnerabilities, as workers’ cyber protection is not the same at home as it is in office. Although the effects of the virus are now subsiding, working remotely has embedded itself as the new normal. Thus, it is imperative for company management to take the necessary steps to ensure business continuity and be prepared to deal with an increased number of cyber threats. In our research, we provide a detailed classification for a group of tools which will facilitate risk mitigation and prevention. We also provide a selection of automated tools such as vulnerability scanners, monitoring and logging tools, and antivirus software. We outline each tool using tables, to show useful information such as advantages, disadvantages, scalability, cost, and other characteristics. Additionally, we implement decision trees for each category of tools, in an attempt to assist in navigating the large amount of information presented in this paper. Our objective is to provide a multifaceted taxonomy and analysis of mitigation tools, which will support companies in their endeavor to protect their computer networks. Our contribution can also help companies to have some type of cyber threat intelligence so as to put themselves one step ahead of cyber criminals.","Iakovakis, George Constantinos-Giovanni Xarhoulacos Giovas Konstantinos Gritzalis Dimitris",Security and Communication Networks,283,16

Using an analytical framework combining Foucauldian discourse analysis with critical multimodality, we explore how Ashley is shaped into existence through discourses portraying him as a superhero, love interest/sex symbol, national treasure, saviour, saint and authority figure. These emergent discourses ride on the wave of longstanding dominant discourses relating to gender and sexuality, alongside nation, class and ethnicity. While dominant discourses may provide reassurance when established realities are under threat, they simultaneously cause harm by reproducing unequal power relations between social groups. We contend that, even in periods of crisis, we should consider what broader messages we are sending when we latch onto the latest discursive trend. Pendant le confinement dû au Covid-19, qui a eu lieu de mars à juin 2020 en Nouvelle Zélande, des produits artistiques et commerciaux représentant Ashley Bloomfield, le Directeur Général de la Santé et ‘héros de la quarantaine’, ont pris la forme de discours genrés. Avec un cadre analytique associant l’analyse du discours foucauldien et la multimodalité critique, nous examinons comment la figure d’Ashley se forme par des discours qui le présentent comme super héros, objet d’amour/symbole sexuel, trésor national, sauveur, saint, et figure d’autorité. Ces discours émergents se nourrissent de discours dominants de longue date liés au genre et à la sexualité, ainsi qu’à la nation, à la classe sociale, et à l’ethnicité. Bien que les discours dominants puissent rassurer lorsque des réalités établies se trouvent menacées, ils causent simultanément des dommages, en reproduisant des relations de pouvoir inégales entre des groupes sociaux.

However, more evidence is needed to understand the population-level impact of the US vaccination rollout in the face of the changing landscape of COVID-19 pandemic in the US, including variants with higher transmissibility and immune escape. Objective: To quantify the population-level impact of the US vaccination campaign in averting cases, hospitalizations and deaths from December 12, 2020 to June 28, 2021. Design: Age-stratified agent-based model which included transmission dynamics of the Alpha, Gamma and Delta variants in addition to the original Wuhan-1 variant. Setting: Our model was calibrated to COVID-19 outbreak and vaccine rollout in the US. Model predictions were made at the country level. Participants: Simulated age-stratified population representing US demographics. Main Outcomes and Measures: Cases, hospitalizations and deaths averted by vaccination against COVID-19 in the US, compared to the counterfactuals of no vaccination and vaccination administered at half the actual pace. Results: The swift vaccine rollout in the US curbed a potential resurgence of cases in April 2021, which would have been otherwise fuelled by the Alpha variant. Compared to the scenario without vaccines, we estimated that the actual vaccination program averted more than 26 million cases, 1.2 million hospitalizations and saved 279,000 lives. A vaccination campaign with half the actual rollout rate would have led to an additional 460,000 hospitalizations and 121,000 deaths. Conclusions and Relevance: The COVID-19 vaccination campaign in the US has had an extraordinary impact on reducing disease burden despite the emergence of highly transmissible variants. These findings highlight that the pace of vaccination was essential for mitigating COVID-19 in the US, and underscore the urgent need to close the vaccine coverage gaps in communities across the country.","Moghadas, S.; Sah, P.; Fitzpatrick, M.

Objectives: To assess the association between the patients' clinical and laboratory records, CT findings, and epidemiological features of COVID-19 with the severity of the disease. Materials and Methods: In this retrospective case-control study conducted on the medical records of confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia patients on admission, we investigated the CT manifestations and clinical and laboratory risk factors for progression to severe COVID-19 pneumonia. The medical records and radiological CT features of confirmed COVID-19 patients were reviewed in one public hospital and one respiratory clinic in Qom, Iran, from August 1 to September 30, 2020. Results: Of 236 confirmed COVID-19 cases, 62 were infected with moderate to severe COVID-19 and required hospital admission, and 174 were followed-up on an outpatient basis. A significant difference was found in the mean age of the outpatient and hospitalized groups. The incidence of bilateral lung involvement, consolidations, linear opacities, crazy-paving pattern, air bronchogram, and number of lobes involved were significantly higher in the hospitalized group compared to the outpatient group. However, the crazy-paving pattern was only significantly associated with an oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) level &lt; 90% and, coughing. Our findings indicated that the crazy-paving pattern was significantly associated with the inflammatory phase. The presence of this pattern on admission, SpO(2) &lt; 90%, older age, and diabetes were independent risk factors for progression to severe COVID-19. Conclusion: The crazy-paving pattern can predict the severity of COVID-19, which is of great importance in the management and follow-up of COVID-19 pneumonia patients. Clinical factors, such as aging, male gender, and diabetes, may be risk factors for the crazy-paving pattern. Severe cough is the most important clinical sign related to this pattern, along with an SpO(2) &lt; 90%, which is an important sign of COVID-19 severity.","Baeis, M.

In vitro, B.1.617.2 is 6-fold less sensitive to serum neutralising antibodies from recovered individuals, and 8-fold less sensitive to vaccine-elicited antibodies as compared to wild type Wuhan-1 bearing D614G. Serum neutralising titres against B.1.617.2 were lower in ChAdOx-1 versus BNT162b2 vaccinees. B.1.617.2 spike pseudotyped viruses exhibited compromised sensitivity to monoclonal antibodies against the receptor binding domain (RBD) and N-terminal domain (NTD), in particular to the clinically approved bamlavinimab and imdevimab monoclonal antibodies. B.1.617.2 demonstrated higher replication efficiency in both airway organoid and human airway epithelial systems as compared to B.1.1.7, associated with B.1.617.2 spike being in a predominantly cleaved state compared to B.1.1.7. Additionally we observed that B.1.617.2 had higher replication and spike mediated entry as compared to B.1.617.1, potentially explaining B.1.617.2 dominance. In an analysis of over 130 SARS-CoV-2 infected healthcare workers across three centres in India during a period of mixed lineage circulation, we observed substantially reduced ChAdOx-1 vaccine efficacy against B.1.617.2 relative to non-B.1.617.2. Compromised vaccine efficacy against the highly fit and immune evasive B.1.617.2 Delta variant warrants continued infection control measures in the post-vaccination era.","Mlcochova, Petra; Kemp, Steven; Dhar, Mahesh Shanker; Papa, Guido; Meng, Bo; Mishra, Swapnil; Whittaker, Charlie; Mellan, Thomas; Ferreira, Isabella; Datir, Rawlings; Collier, Dami A.; Albecka, Anna; Singh, Sujeet; Pandey, Rajesh; Brown, Jonathan; Zhou, Jie; Goonawardne, Niluka; Marwal, Robin; Datta, Meena; Sengupta, Shantanu; Ponnusamy, Kalaiarasan; Radhakrishnan, Venkatraman Srinivasan; Abdullahi, Adam; Charles, Oscar; Chattopadhyay, Partha; Devi, Priti; Caputo, Daniela; Peacock, Tom; Wattal, Chand; Goel, Neeraj; Satwik, Ambrish; Vaishya, Raju; Agarwal, Meenakshi; Mavousian, Antranik; Lee, Joo Hyeon; Bassi, Jessica; Silacci-Fegni, Chiara; Saliba, Christian; Pinto, Dora; Irie, Takashi; Yoshida, Isao; Hamilton, William L.; Sato, Kei; James, Leo; Corti, Davide; Piccoli, Luca; Bhatt, Samir; Flaxman, Seth; Barclay, Wendy S.; Rakshit, Partha; Agrawal, Anurag; Gupta, Ravindra K.",bioRxiv,283,23

There is evidence that mechanisms that contribute in thrombosis in COVID-19 patients are similar to those in anti-phospholipid syndrome (aPS). In fact, there is a possibility that anti-phospholipid autoantibodies (aPLs) might impulse thrombosis in patients with COVID-19, as literature suggests2. Objectives: The aim of our study was to evaluate the anti-phospholipid autoantibody titre in patients with COVID-19 during and after the infection. Methods: This is an observational study which included 71 patients with a recent COVID-19 up to 4 weeks after. Every patient was completed with aPL titre about IgG and IgM anti-cardiolipine (ACA) and lupus anticoagulant (LAC) autoantibodies. According to titre results, the patients were divided into groups in order to better show the immunologic results. Results: After gathering and analysing the data, it was estimated that 21 patients (29.6%) were positive for at least one type of aPL antibody: 12 patients were found positive for lupus anticoagulant autoantibodies (57.1%), 6 patients were double positive for LAC and ACA (28.6%), and 3 patients were positive for anti-cardiolipin antibodies (14.3%). Seven patients were IgM positive for any aPL (33.3%), 6 patients were found to have positive IgM and IgG (28.6%) and 8 patients had only IgG antibodies (38.1%). Conclusion: From this study it was observed that a significant proportion of patients with recent COVID-19 infection had positive anti-phospholipid antibodies, compared to the general population prevalence. This suggests that the impact of aPLs in COVID-19 might be of great importance. It should be carefully evaluated in order to better understand the mechanisms of thrombotic complications.","Jordhani, M.; Ruci, D.; Ruci, V.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,283,1

In response to these unprecedented challenges, universities are formulating more student development initiatives to support new students to transition into university and produce holistic graduates with essential soft skills. Student engagement evaluation can help inform and enhance the implementation of student development programs. In this study, seven domains of first year university students’ engagement were evaluated namely Academic Engagement (AE), Beyond-class Engagement (BE), Intellectual Engagement (IE), Online Engagement (OE), Peer Engagement (PE), Student-staff Engagement (SE) and Transition Engagement (TE). This study found that university freshmen’s Online Engagement (OE) was the strongest while their Academic Engagement (AE) was the weakest. This study also discovered that first year university students’ engagement were weakest with regard to reading of textbooks before attending class, asking questions in class and borrowing books from the university library. Future student development programs targeted at first year university students could be enhanced by increasing the use of ICT in teaching and learning as well as increasing efforts in assisting new students to transition from school to university learning environments by inculcating good reading habits and encouraging active class participation. © 2021.

We estimated greater excess mortality than official COVID-19 mortality in the U.S. (excess mortality 95% confidence interval (CI) (100013, 127501) vs. 78834 COVID-19 deaths) and 9 states: California (excess mortality 95% CI (3338, 6344) vs. 2849 COVID-19 deaths); Connecticut (excess mortality 95% CI (3095, 3952) vs. 2932 COVID-19 deaths); Illinois (95% CI (4646, 6111) vs. 3525 COVID-19 deaths); Louisiana (excess mortality 95% CI (2341, 3183) vs. 2267 COVID-19 deaths); Massachusetts (95% CI (5562, 7201) vs. 5050 COVID-19 deaths); New Jersey (95% CI (13170, 16058) vs. 10465 COVID-19 deaths); New York (95% CI (32538, 39960) vs. 26584 COVID-19 deaths); and Pennsylvania (95% CI (5125, 6560) vs. 3793 COVID-19 deaths). Conventional model results were consistent with semiparametric results but less precise. Significant excess pneumonia deaths were also found for all locations and we estimated hundreds of excess influenza deaths in New York. We find that official COVID-19 mortality substantially understates actual mortality, excess deaths cannot be explained entirely by official COVID-19 death counts. Mortality reporting lags appeared to worsen during the pandemic, when timeliness in surveillance systems was most crucial for improving pandemic response.","Rivera, Roberto; Rosenbaum, Janet; Quispe, Walter",,283,1

On March, 2020, the WHO announced that COVID-19 could be characterised as a pandemic (WHO, 2020a). Then, it was rapidly spread from China to others countries. Coronavirus disease, COVID-19, is a viral infection that generates a severe acute respiratory syndrome with serious clinical symptoms given by such as fever, dry cough, and pneumonia (Kucharski et al., 2020). In addition, this virus is so widespread among people and it is difficult to control. To fight the rapid spread of new diseases like COVID-19, the support of technologies such as AI, big data, and IoT has proved to be very useful and provides better pandemic spread control tools. In this paper, we propose to leverage smart grid technology to detect COVID-19 cases clusters, to accelerate pandemic remote monitoring, and to predict probable virus future spread by collecting and analysing retrieved data.

The critical infrastructure capabilities to be sustained during disasters are many. COVID-19 has demonstrated how a public health threat can fracture the supply chains, including those that underpin digital systems, and degrade the capacity of software and hardware companies. Society must plan for such digital disruptions if it is to survive such shocks. We explore some of the reasons why this is necessary, including the issue of cascading failures, and examines how and in what form more resilient systems might take. This includes consideration of issues such as the need for incentives in order to drive and maintain adoption of resilient technologies, and how such incentives can be created as a natural property of well-conceived systems. We also briefly examine two initiatives that seek to solve some of the harder problems, including security, trustability, independence from energy and communications infrastructure, and the ability to sustain digital capabilities when digital supply chains fail. This remains an open area requiring attention, if society is to improve its resilience to significant shocks.","Gardner-Stephen, P.; Nabben, K.; Ieee,",2020 Ieee Global Humanitarian Technology Conference,283,12

Depressive pattern reflects inability to sustain ambiguity due to deficiency of internal supports, overly dependence on others, conformity, obedience to authority and denial of personal standards and individuality. Noogenic pattern refers to negative affective states, generated by the ambiguity, contradictions and ambivalence of information. The means to regulate it include the lowering of the level of psychical functioning, with cognitive simplification, preference for order, routine and predictability. Transgression pattern suggests maniacal fascination with the dissipation of limits, normative restraints and rules, and the triumph of the narcissistic-perfectionist permissiveness. Constructivity pattern consists of the pleasure from explorations and insights, creation of new meanings, creative reappraisal and reconstruction of ambiguous situations.ConclusionsThe typical patterns of experiencing ambiguity that were singled out may have diagnostic and prognostic significance in evaluating the individual resource potential in situations of COVID related dangers and isolation.","Sokolova, E.; Ryzhov, A.; Pechnikova, L.",European Psychiatry,283,1

Disorders of calcium metabolism are a frequently encountered medical problem. The effect of hypocalcemia is not well defined on the outcomes of patients with PE. We aimed to identify the prognostic value of hypocalcemia in hospitalized PE patients utilizing the 2017 Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS). In this retrospective study, we selected patients with a primary diagnosis of Acute PE using ICD 10 codes. They were further stratified based on the presence of hypocalcemia. We primarily aimed to compare in-hospital mortality for PE patients with and without hypocalcemia. In the 2017 NIS, 187,989 patients had a principal diagnosis of acute PE. Among the above study group, 1565(0.8%)had an additional diagnosis of hypocalcemia. 12.4% of PE patients with hypocalcemia died in the hospital in comparison to 2.95% without hypocalcemia. On multivariate regression analysis, PE and hypocalcemia patients had 4 times higher odds (aOR-4.03, 95% CI 2.78-5.84, p<0.001) of in-hospital mortality compared to those with only PE. We observed a similarly high odds of mortality(aOR=4.4) on 1:1 propensity-matched analysis. The incidence of acute kidney injury (aOR=2.62, CI 1.95-3.52, p<0.001), acute respiratory failure (a0R=1.84, CI 1.42-2.38, p<0.001), sepsis (aOR=4.99, CI 3.08-8.11, p<0.001) and arrhythmias (aOR=2.63, CI 1.99-3.48, p<0.001) were also higher for PE patients with hypocalcemia. Thus, PE patients with hypocalcemia have higher in-hospital complications and mortality than those without hypocalcemia.","Murthi, M.; Shaka, H.; El-amir, Z.; Velagapudi, S.; Jamil, A.; Wani, F.; Atluri, R.; Kumar, A.; Kichloo, A.",,283,16

Domains are more than 100kb in size; complexes less than 100kb. They are present in the genomes of organisms ranging from fission yeast to man, with an expansion in size and number in mammals. Some of the likely functions of the domains/complexes include silencing of the donor mating type region in fission yeast, regulation of mammalian imprinted genes and the phylotypic progression during vertebrate development. Far cis- and trans-contacts between micro-phase separated domains/complexes in mammalian nuclei contribute to the emergence of epigenetic compartmental domains (ECDs) detected in Hi-C maps. We speculate that a thermodynamic description of micro-phase separation of heterochromatin-like domains/complexes will require a gestalt shift away from the monomer as the “unit of incompatibility”, where it is the choice of monomer that determines the sign and magnitude of the Flory-Huggins parameter, χ. Instead, a more dynamic structure, the oligo-nucleosomal “clutch”, consisting of between 2 to 10 nucleosomes is both the long sought-after secondary structure of chromatin and its unit of incompatibility. Based on this assumption we present a simple theoretical framework that enables an estimation of χ for domains/complexes flanked by euchromatin and thereby an indication of their tendency to phase separate. The degree of phase separation is specified by χN, where N is the number of “clutches” in a domain/complex. Our approach may provide an additional tool for understanding the biophysics of the 3D genome.","Singh, Prim B.; Belyakin, Stepan N.; Laktionov, Petr P.",bioRxiv,283,1

Results showed rates of 86% recovered or vaccinated at least once and 54.5% fully vaccinated. These vaccination rates were considerably higher compared to the general population. Vaccination hesitancy was half that of the general population at 6.4%. The findings of this large sample indicate that in the field of music culture there is a high vaccination rate and a low rejection of vaccination on the part of the audience and the performers.

Consequently, the Medical Intern Programme, a unique two year programme consisting of an observership, four clinical rotations at the level of a foundation doctor within an NHS Trust and a postgraduate diploma from a university in the north of England, was set up to enhance the NHS workforce by facilitating the entry of international medical graduates into UK medicine via a supported transitional programme. We aimed to explore the experiences of the doctors enrolled on the Medical Intern Programme. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted via the telephone with seven doctors enrolled on the programme. The interview guide was informed by the research questions and data were analysed using a thematic analysis. Results: We identified four themes that were important in the experiences of the doctors: preparing to work in the UK, feeling supported, weighing up the pros and cons of the programme and comparisons between countries. Conclusions: The Medical Intern Programme successfully facilitated international doctors' transition to the UK and working in the NHS. Support needs to be provided at the organisational, team and individual level including a period of observing and shadowing to enable the doctors to understand the systems and multidisciplinary team working in the NHS.","Lavallee, J.

These services are the response of journalism to disinformation, that has transformed a common internal procedure of journalistic work in the core of a business directed to the general public, also offered to the companies of mass media and social media. Literature review shows that the research on fact-checking has focused on the origin, funding, relationship with the media, procedures, and experiences related to politics and COVID-19. However, the ownership structure of the fact-checking services has been superficially analysed and the business model of these platforms has not yet been studied in detail and depth. The objective of this article is to identify and analyse the business model of the nine Spanish active fact-checking services through a documentary research of public information sources and the information that these services give about themselves. This paper explains their ownership structure and income provenance, from open information sources. The findings are that the fact-checking services that depend on media groups are no strangers to the trend of opacity usual in these groups, but in the case of fact-checking services that are born as initiatives of journalists, the trend towards transparency is, in the majority of cases, clear. However, the information provided by the Spanish fact-checking services is deficient and does not allow us to discover their business models, except in the case of Newtral and, to a certain extent, Maldita. © 2021 by the authors.

One of the suggested methods for mental health improvement is more intensive contact with nature, including birdwatching as a hobby. Material and methods: After an ornithological walk in February 2021 for 5 psychiatrists and psychotherapists, in spite of unfavourable weather, all participants very positively evaluated the impact of birding on their well-being, mood and subjective evaluation of stress level. Results: Particularly important is an observation that the pandemic reality forced the whole society, including mental health professionals, to limit their behaviours and attitudes to very “adult” and responsible ones. Everyday life was reduced to functioning based on a very concrete approach to reality while abandoning activities that stimulate imagination (travels, theatre, arts). The ornithological walk allowed participants to abandon the pandemic reality and enter the space of playfulness, fantasies and childhood experiences. It enabled immersion in a friendly “mother-world” in which sensory perceptions proved to be important: smell, touch (“rush of air”), feeling of space. Birds were perceived not only as direct objects of observations but also as symbols of freedom, energy and lightness. Conclusions: Despite the small group size, ornithological walks are recommended as a nature-based intervention exerting a positive influence on the mental health of psychiatrists and psychotherapists. It is also believed to positively affect the management of their patients, although this and many other aspects require further research.","Murawiec, S.; Tryjanowski, P.; Nita, A.",Psychiatria,283,1

Therefore, viruses must inhibit these signaling pathways, avoid being detected, or both. Papillomavirus virions are trafficked from early endosomes to the Golgi apparatus and wait for the onset of mitosis to complete nuclear entry. This unique subcellular trafficking strategy avoids detection by cytoplasmic PRRs, a property that may contribute to establishment of infection. However, as the capsid uncoats within acidic endosomal compartments, the viral DNA may be exposed to detection by toll-like receptor (TLR) 9. In this study we characterize two new papillomaviruses from bats and use molecular archeology to demonstrate that their genomes altered their nucleotide composition to avoid detection by TLR9, providing evidence that TLR9 acts as a PRR during papillomavirus infection. Furthermore, we demonstrate that TLR9, like other components of the innate immune system, is under evolutionary selection in bats, providing the first direct evidence for co-evolution between papillomaviruses and their hosts.","King, Kelly; Larsen, Brendan B.; Gryseels, Sophie; Richet, Cécile; Kraberger, Simona; Jackson, Robert; Worobey, Michael; Harrison, Joseph S.; Varsani, Arvind; Doorslaer, Koenraad Van",bioRxiv,283,25

This was related to the realisation that the novel coronavirus was spreading across the country. To the general population the impact of the virus was unknown. Gradually the federal government started closing the country’s borders. The panic buying of toilet rolls was not unique to Australia. It happened across all societies that used toilet paper rather than water to clean after defecation and urination. However, research suggests that the panic buying was most extreme in Australia. This article argues that the panic buying was closely linked to everyday notions of Western civilisation. Pedestal toilets and toilet paper are key aspects of civilisation and the fear of the loss of toilet paper is connected to anxiety about social breakdown, the loss of civilisation. This is the fear manifested in the perceived threat posed by the virus.

The ESSENCE concept began in an internally funded project at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU/APL), advanced with funding from the State of Maryland, and broadened in 1999 as a collaboration with the Walter Reed Army Institute for Research. Versions of the system have been further developed by JHU/APL in multiple military and civilian programs for timely detection and tracking of health threats. Features of ESSENCE include spatial and temporal statistical alerting, custom querying, user-defined alert notifications, geographical mapping, remote data capture, and event communications. These features allow ESSENCE users to gather and organize the resulting wealth of information into a coherent view of population health status and communicate findings among users. The resulting broad utility, applicability and adaptability of this system led to adoption of ESSENCE by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), numerous state and local health departments, and the Department of Defense (DOD) both nationally and globally. With emerging high-consequence communicable diseases and other health conditions, the continued user-requirements-driven enhancements of ESSENCE demonstrate an adaptable disease surveillance capability focused on the everyday needs of public health.

Mutations in Retromer cause late-onset Parkinson’s disease, while viral and bacterial pathogens can hijack the complex during cellular infection. To modulate and probe its function we have created a novel series of macrocyclic peptides that bind Retromer with high affinity and specificity. Crystal structures show the majority of cyclic peptides bind to Vps29 via a Pro-Leu-containing sequence, structurally mimicking known interactors such as TBC1D5, and blocking their interaction with Retromer in vitro and in cells. By contrast, macrocyclic peptide RT-L4 binds Retromer at the Vps35-Vps26 interface and is a more effective molecular chaperone than reported small molecules, suggesting a new therapeutic avenue for targeting Retromer. Finally, tagged peptides can be used to probe the cellular localisation of Retromer and its functional interactions in cells, providing novel tools for studying Retromer function.","Chen, Kai-En; Guo, Qian; Cui, Yi; Kendall, Amy K.; Hill, Timothy A.; Hall, Ryan J.; Sacharz, Joanna; Norwood, Suzanne J.; Xie, Boyang; Leneva, Natalya; Yang, Zhe; Ghai, Rajesh; Stroud, David A.; Fairlie, David; Suga, Hiroaki; Jackson, Lauren P.; Teasdale, Rohan D.; Passioura, Toby; Collins, Brett M.",bioRxiv,283,1

The versatility of the ambidexterity concept allows using it to test multiple research questions from various perspectives. It explains that in the last decades, the research in organizational ambidexterity has been exponentially rising. The authors argued that the proliferation of papers represents a consolidation stage of any phenomenon. Therefore, in this development cycle, the two possibilities maybe its decline or re-focus along new lines. Although the publication pattern focused on strategic management journals, it does not mean that organizational ambidexterity is only observed in established and mature organizations' strategies. Several entrepreneurial organizations have been born (e.g., new ventures) or have rejuvenated (i.e., established ventures with an entrepreneurial orientation) by implementing and developing an organizational ambidexterity capacity. This study is motivated by the apparent unrepresentativeness of organizational ambidexterity in entrepreneurship studies. Therefore, (a) we look back to the past 15 years of published research by focusing on the contribution of organizational ambidexterity to the fields of management studies and entrepreneurship studies;and (b) we look forward to the research in organizational ambidexterity by inspiring the analysis of ambidexterity's role in the current scenarios (social, economic, technological, environmental) in management and entrepreneurship studies. Based on this review and analysis, we show the underrepresentation of entrepreneurship in the published ambidexterity literature until the last decade (the 2010s). Motivated by this insight, we provoke the discussion about how the concept of ambidexterity, characterized by managing a double tension simultaneously, is a potential ingredient in the entrepreneurial decision-making process of individuals, teams, organizations, and eco-systems agents. We encourage new research lines that help refresh the analysis of ambidexterity in the entrepreneurship field and re-thinking its contribution to the reconciliation process between management, innovation, and entrepreneurship fields. Furthermore, several implications to managers, entrepreneurial organizations, and entrepreneurs emerge from this study. Concretely, we encourage them to consider this approach as a way of thinking to face the current social, economic, and health problems that we are living in due to the COVID-19 pandemic effects.","Guerrero, M.",Foundations and Trends in Entrepreneurship,283,28

It plays an important role in viral infection and immune escape by not only cleaving the viral polyprotein ORF1ab at 11 sites, but also cleaving the host proteins. However, there is still a lack of effective tools for determining the cleavage sites of the 3CL protease. This study systematically investigated the diversity of the cleavage sites of the coronavirus 3CL protease on the viral polyprotein, and found that the cleavage motif were highly conserved for viruses in the genera of Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus and Gammacoronavirus. Strong residue preferences were observed at the neighboring positions of the cleavage sites. A random forest (RF) model was built to predict the cleavage sites of the coronavirus 3CL protease based on the representation of residues at cleavage site and neighboring positions by amino acid indexes, and the model achieved an AUC of 0.96 in cross-validations. The RF model was further tested on an independent test dataset composed of cleavage sites on host proteins, and achieved an AUC of 0.88 and a prediction precision of 0.80 when considering the accessibility of the cleavage site. Then, 1,079 human proteins were predicted to be cleaved by the 3CL protease by the RF model. These proteins were enriched in pathways related to neurodegenerative diseases and pathogen infection. Finally, a user-friendly online server named 3CLP was built to predict the cleavage sites of the coronavirus 3CL protease based on the RF model. Overall, the study not only provides an effective tool for identifying the cleavage sites of the 3CL protease, but also provides insights into the molecular mechanism underlying the pathogenicity of coronaviruses.","Chen, Huiting; Zhu, Zhaozhong; Qiu, Ye; Ge, Xingyi; Zheng, Heping; Peng, Yousong",bioRxiv,283,16

However, the outbreak and transmission of COVID-19 had significant implications for the entire value chain in the oil industry. The price crash and the fluctuations in price is known to have far reaching effect on global economies, with Nigeria hard. It has therefore become imperative to develop a tool for forecasting the price of crude oil in order to minimise the risks associated with volatility in oil prices and also be able to do proper planning. Hence, this article proposed a hybrid forecasting model involving a classical and machine learning techniques - autoregressive neural network, in determining the prices of crude oil. The monthly data used were obtained from the Central Bank of Nigeria website, spanning January 2006 to October 2020. Statistical efficiency was computed for the hybrid, and the models from which the proposed hybrid was built, using the percent relative efficiency. Analyses showed that the efficiency of the hybrid model, at 20 and 100 hidden neurons, was higher than that of the individual models, the latter being the best performing.

Longitudinal followup is needed to characterize the severity, sequelae and outcomes in pts with cancer who develop COVID-19. Methods: NCCAPS is a prospective, longitudinal study (NCT04387656) aiming to accrue 2,000 pts with cancer undergoing active treatment or prior stem cell transplant for hematologic or solid tumor malignancy. Adult patients are eligible to enroll within 14 days of their first positive SARS-CoV-2 test;pediatric patients may also enroll retrospectively. Clinical data, patient-reported outcomes, blood specimens, and imaging are collected for up to 2 years. This abstract provides initial baseline and 2-month follow-up data. Results: As of Jan 22, 2021, 585 pts (552 adults and 33 pediatric pts) had complete baseline data and of these pts, 215 adults had 2 months of complete follow-up data. 23.4% of adults and 42.4% of pediatric pts were of nonWhite race and/or Hispanic/Latinx ethnicity. The most common cancer diagnoses were breast (19.6%), lung (9.9%) and multiple myeloma (8.9%) in adults and acute leukemia (AML/ALL;63.6%) in children. The most recent treatment was chemotherapy in 38.2%, immunotherapy in 9.6%, and radiation in 5.4%. Median time from positive SARS-CoV-2 test to study enrollment was 10.5 days in adults and 18 days in pediatric pts. Preliminary analysis of plasma cytokines will be presented. At enrollment, 84.6% of adults had COVID-19 symptoms. 55.9% reported symptoms 2 weeks after their positive SARSCoV-2 test;this fell to 39.0% at 1 month and 28.8% at 2 months (see Table). Of the 215 adults with complete data at 2 months, sequelae included pulmonary (n=22, 10%), cardiovascular (n=12, 6%) thromboembolic (n=9, 4%), bleeding (n=9, 4%) and gastrointestinal (n=11, 5%). 144 (67%) reported at least one cancer treatment disruption in the first 2 months, most commonly delayed therapy (n=98;46%).Of the 348 adults with baseline data and SARS-CoV-2 test date prior to Nov 23, 2020, 6.3% had died (median time from SARS-CoV-2 test to death: 27 days), and 22.1% reported at least one hospitalization for COVID-19. No deaths were reported in the pediatric population. Conclusion: Cancer pts with COVID-19 report ongoing symptoms after acute infection and a substantial number develop sequelae. Cancer treatment disruptions are common in the initial months following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Longer follow-up will inform whether these treatment disruptions are associated with adverse outcomes.

They have critical roles in most pathways involved in plant growth and reproductive development. Reproductive organs of monocots produce abundant phased, small interfering RNAs (phasiRNAs). The 21-nt reproductive phasiRNAs triggered by miR2118 are highly enriched in pre-meiotic anthers, and have not been described in eudicots. The 24-nt reproductive phasiRNAs are triggered by miR2275, and are highly enriched during meiosis in many angiosperms. Here, we describe additional variants of 21-nt reproductive phasiRNAs, including those triggered by miR11308 in wild strawberry, a eudicot, and we validate the presence of this pathway in rose. We report the widespread presence of the 21-nt reproductive phasiRNA pathway in eudicots, with novel biogenesis triggers in the basal eudicot columbine and the rosid flax. In eudicots, these 21-nt phasiRNAs are enriched in pre-meiotic stages, a spatiotemporal distribution consistent with that of monocots and suggesting a role in anther development. Although this pathway is apparently absent in well-studied eudicot families including the Brassicaceae, Solanaceae and Fabaceae, our work in eudicots supports a singular finding in spruce, indicating that the pathway of 21-nt reproductive phasiRNAs emerged in seed plants and was lost in some lineages.","Pokhrel, Suresh; Huang, Kun; Bélanger, Sébastien; Caplan, Jeffrey L.; Kramer, Elena M.; Meyers, Blake C.",bioRxiv,283,1

This paper describes early findings of a case study of 13 Danish first- and second-line managers’ experiences with distance management during COVID-19. The qualitative study collected data from May to December 2020 during six rounds. The analysis shows that the managers take the responsibility on them to make working from home function for their employees and seek new ways of organizing and manage work from home. They appreciate the flexibility and that meetings have become more efficient but also equal and inclusive. The new role provide them with new skills and tasks. However, distance management also comes with a cost i.e. longer workdays and awkward working hours, the tasks are demanding and require planning. The managers miss the social interaction that the office provides and work hard to create a sense of proximity and trust across distance. The study shows that the lockdowns have impacted managers’ experiences of their management job in a positive and negative way.

Business schools have been extensively blamed in previous crises for not educating their students in a responsible way. The COVID-19 pandemic could be the pivotal opportunity for business schools to regain legitimacy and a wake-up call to accelerate their journey towards RME. The authors aim to outline an illustration of the transition to a hybrid teaching model and how such educational reconfiguration might lead to more sustainable and RME, also beyond COVID-19. Design/methodology/approach A qualitative approach is proposed to analyse and decrypt the challenges and opportunities of a hybrid approach, its implications for the transformation of business schools and RME. This study also includes a state-of-the-art literature review, a specific investigation of the case of ESCP, the European cross-border multi-campus business school, and in-depth interviews with stakeholders impacted by the crisis. Findings The health crisis demonstrated the unprecedented capability of higher education to embrace rapid and profound change. Furthermore, the pandemic served as a wake-up call in that it may even have caused the progress of business schools, previously somewhat reluctant, towards more socially responsible and sustainable thinking. Thus, the schools have used the COVID-19 crisis as an opportunity to regain legitimacy and be part of the solution rather than part of the problem. Practical implications The paper pulls together a multitude of suggestions for higher education in general and business schools in particular. Originality/value Combining two of higher education's main challenges, namely, digitalisation and sustainability and applying the principles for responsible management education framework to map and analyse the pandemic's implications, this paper provides a new, compelling and inspiring resource for business schools on their path to a more responsible management approach and education.","Pucciarelli, F.; Kaplan, A.",Journal of Global Responsibility,283,1

Methods Data was extracted from publicly available datasets from Medicare Benefits Schedule(MBS) using item numbers assigned to each commonly performed urological intervention. These procedures were divided into three groups: Oncological therapeutic, diagnostic and non-oncological therapeutic procedures. A smoothing model, based on the historic procedure numbers from 2017 to 2019, was used to forecast monthly number of procedures performed in each category between January and June 2020. These forecasted models were compared with reported figures. Results A total of 108 169 procedures performed between January and June 2020 based on the MBS item numbers listed.

Since the current nosology-based standard for human diseases could not offer a one-size-fits-all corrective mechanism, many idiomatic but flawed names frequently appear in scientific literature and news outlets at the cost of sociocultural impacts. Objective We attempt to examine the ethical oversights of current naming practices and propose heuristic rationales and approaches to determine a pithy name instead of an inopportune nosology. Methods First, we examined the compiled global online news volumes and emotional tones on some inopportune nosology like German measles, Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome, Spanish flu, Hong Kong flu, and Huntington’s disease in the wake of COVID-19. Second, we prototypically scrutinize the lexical dynamics and pathological differentials of German measles and common synonyms by leveraging the capacity of the Google Books Ngram Corpus. Third, we demonstrated the empirical approaches to curate an exclusive substitute for an anachronistic nosology German measles based on deep learning models and post-hoc explanations. Results The infodemiological study shows that the public informed the offensive names with extremely negative tones in textual and visual narratives. The findings of the historiographical study indicate that many synonyms of German measles did not survive, while German measles became an anachronistic usage, and rubella has taken the dominant place since 1994. The PubMedBERT model could identify rubella as a potential substitution for German measles with the highest semantic similarity. The results of the semantic drift experiments further indicate that rubella tends to survive during the ebb and flow of semantic drift. Conclusions Our findings indicate that the nosological evolution of anachronistic names could result in sociocultural impacts without a corrective mechanism. To mitigate such impacts, we introduce some ethical principles for formulating an improved naming scheme. Based on deep learning models and post-hoc explanations, our illustrated experiments could provide hallmark references to the remedial mechanism of naming practices and pertinent credit allocations.","Hu, Zhiwen; Chen, Ya; Song, Yuling; Yang, Zhongliang; Huang, Hui",bioRxiv,283,13

Shortages in reagents and vaccines are a major challenge, as well as limited knowledge on dose response relationship with mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. We explored intradermal fractional dose administration of a mRNA SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 vaccine as a potential dose-sparing strategy. Methods We conducted a proof-of-concept, dose-escalation, open-label, randomised-controlled vaccine trial (IDSCOVA) in healthy adults aged 18-30 years. To test initial safety, ten participants received 10 g mRNA-1273 vaccine through intradermal injection at day 1 and 29. Following a favourable safety review, thirty participants were 1:1 randomised to receive 20 g mRNA-1273 either intradermally or intramuscularly. The primary endpoint was tolerability and safety. The secondary endpoint was seroconversion and specific IgG concentration against SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 and Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) after the second dose at day 43. We compared results to two historical cohorts of non-hospitalised COVID-19 patients and vaccinated individuals. Findings Thirty-eight of forty included participants (median age 25 years) completed the study. There were no serious adverse events. Self-reported local adverse reactions after intradermal delivery were mild, both in the 10 g and the 20 g group. In the higher dose group, systemic adverse reactions were more common, but still well tolerated. All 38 participants mounted substantially higher IgG-anti-S1 and IgG-anti-RBD concentrations at day 43 than COVID-19 controls. At day 43, anti-S1 (95% CI) was 1,696 (1,309-2,198) BAU/mL for the 10 g intradermal group, 1,406 (953.5-2,074) BAU/mL for the 20 g intramuscular group and 2,057 (1,421-2,975) BAU/mL for the 20 g intradermal group.

Findings Those high on collectivism and high on global personal impact associated with lower COVID-19 public policy hypocrisy. These individuals indicated consistent support for community and individual policies, likely requiring personal sacrifices. Indirect conditional effects of lower conscientiousness associated with higher hypocrisy among those collectivistic. Originality/value Participants evaluated preference to original public safety ads, representative of basic societal and individual benefits. Those higher on collectivism preferred societal ""we"" versus individual ""me"" public safety ads. Implications discuss benefits of personal and communal public health messaging in an individualistic society so businesses can reopen. Entrepreneurs experienced major economic setbacks that effective public health policies could have mitigated.","Bok, S.; Shum, J.; Harvie, J.; Lee, M.",Journal of Entrepreneurship and Public Policy,283,1

Design: Population-based cohort study. Setting: Observational cohort study from 2018 to 2021 using the Information System for Research in Primary Care (SIDIAP) database in Catalonia, Spain. Participants: 4,255,847 individuals aged 18 or older in SIDIAP on 1 March, 2018 with no prior history of anxiety and depressive disorders. Primary and secondary outcomes measures: Incidence of anxiety and depressive disorders prior to COVID-19 (March, 2018 to February, 2020), during the COVID-19 lockdown (March to June, 2020) and post-lockdown periods (from July, 2020 to March, 2021) were calculated. Forecasted rates over COVID-19 periods were estimated using negative binomial regression models based on previous data. The percentage reduction was estimated by comparing forecasted versus observed events, overall and by age, sex and socioeconomic status. Results: The incidence rates per 100,000 person-months of anxiety and depressive disorders were 171.0 (95%CI: 170.2-171.8) and 46.6 (46.2-47.0), respectively, during the pre-lockdown period. We observed an increase of 39.7% (95%PI: 26.5 to 53.3) in incident anxiety diagnoses compared to the expected in March, 2020, followed by a reduction of 16.9% (8.6 to 24.5) during the post-lockdown periods. A reduction of incident depressive disorders occurred during the lockdown and post-lockdown periods (46.6% [38.9 to 53.1] and 23.2% [12.0 to 32.7], respectively). Reductions were higher among adults aged 18 to 34 and individuals living in most deprived areas. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic in Catalonia was associated with an initial increase in anxiety disorders diagnosed in primary care, but a reduction in cases as the pandemic continued. Diagnoses of depressive disorders were lower than expected throughout the pandemic.","Raventos, B.; Pistillo, A.; Reyes, C.; Fernandez-Bertolin, S.; Aragon, M.; Berenguera, A.; Jacques-Avino, C.; Medina-Perucha, L.; Burn, E.; Duarte-Salles, T.",,283,0

The cyclic peptide natural product “A3” appears to be related to ternatin, but its complete structure is unknown and only 4 of its 11 stereocenters have been assigned. Hence, A3 could be any one of 128 possible stereoisomers. Guided by the stereochemistry of ternatin and more potent structural variants, we synthesized two A3 epimers, “SR-A3” and “SS-A3”. We found that synthetic SR-A3 is indistinguishable from naturally derived A3 and potently inhibits cancer cell proliferation. Relative to SS-A3 and previously characterized ternatin variants, SR-A3 exhibits a dramatically enhanced duration of action. This increase in cellular residence time is conferred, stereospecifically, by a single β-hydroxy group attached to N-methyl leucine. SR-A3 thus exemplifies a mechanism for enhancing the pharmacological potency of cyclic peptide natural products via side-chain hydroxylation.","Wang, Hao-Yuan; Oltion, Keely; Al-Khdhairawi, Amjad Ayad Qatran; Weber, Jean-Frédéric F.; Taunton, Jack",bioRxiv,283,16

However little is known about the impact of oncologic treatments in the evolution of the disease. On the other hand, the influence of SARS-CoV2 in cancer response remains to be established. We aim to determine both aspects in renal cancer patients receiving different therapeutic options. Methods: We designed a retrospective casecontrol study to compare the outcome of patients with advanced renal cancer who developed COVID19 under antiangiogenic treatment (cohort A [ChA]) vs immunotherapy (alone or in combination: cohort B [ChB]) vs matched controls (cohort C [ChC]). Controls were renal cancer patients who were not infected during the period of study. One control per case was selected regarding age, gender, kidney cancer histology and type of treatment. Results: From May 20 to Feb 21, 80 patients were recruited. We present the first 55 patients included (15 ChA, 16 ChB and 20 ChC, 4 patients were screening failure) from 13 centers in Spain. Median age was 62 (range 25 to 88) overall and 62 (range 44 to 88) in Ch A, 64,5 (range 42 to 83) in ChB and 61 (range 41 to 77) in ChC. 38 patients were male and 13 were female. Overall 45 cases were clear cell carcinoma (13 ChA, 14 ChB and 18 ChC), 4 papillary (1 ChA, 2 ChB and 1 ChC), 1 chromophobe (ChA) and 1 unclassified (ChC). Median number of prior lines of treatment was 2 (range 1 to 6) overall, (1 [range 1 to 4] in ChA, 2 [range 1 to 4] in ChB and 2 [range 1 to 6] in ChC). 25 patients required treatment interruptions (8 in ChA [32%], 14 in ChB [56%] and 3 [12%] in ChC). 9 patients were hospitalized (4 in Ch A, 5 in ChB and none in ChC) for a median of 10 days (range 4 to 16) overall (7 [range 4 to 14] in ChA and 12 [range 5 to 16] in ChB). No patient required ICU admission. Best tumor response was complete or partial (CR+PR) in 25 patients (5 [20%] in ChA, 9 [36%] in ChB and 11 [44%] in ChC). Clinical benefit (CR+PR+stable disease) was observed in 38 patients (11 [28,9%] in ChA, 10 [26,3%] in ChB and 17 [44,7%] in ChC). One patient in ChB died (due to COVID19). Updated results will be presented. Conclusions: Patients with renal cancer who developed COVID19 held treatment more frequently and presented lower clinical benefit rates than non infected cases. Patients receiving immunotherapy required more frequent dose interruptions and longer hospitalizations than cases on antiangiogenics. These results point to an impact of SARS-CoV2 in renal cancer outcome. Therapies administered to treat renal cancer, could play a role in the evolution of COVID19.","Donas, J.

However, the detailed roles of coarse (>5m) and fine ([≤]5m) respiratory aerosols produced when breathing, talking, and singing are not well-understood. Methods: Using a G-II exhaled breath collector, we measured viral RNA in coarse and fine respiratory aerosols emitted by COVID-19 patients during 30 minutes of breathing, 15 minutes of talking, and 15 minutes of singing. Results: Among the 22 study participants, 13 (59%) emitted detectable levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in respiratory aerosols, including 3 asymptomatic patients and 1 presymptomatic patient. Viral loads ranged from 63 - 5,821 N gene copies per expiratory activity. Patients earlier in illness were more likely to emit detectable RNA, and loads differed significantly between breathing, talking, and singing. The largest proportion of SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies was emitted by singing (53%), followed by talking (41%) and breathing (6%). Overall, fine aerosols constituted 85% of the viral load detected in our study. Virus cultures were negative. Conclusions: Fine aerosols produced by talking and singing contain more SARS-CoV-2 copies than coarse aerosols and may play a significant role in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Exposure to fine aerosols should be mitigated, especially in indoor environments where airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is likely to occur. Isolating viable SARS-CoV-2 from respiratory aerosol samples remains challenging, and whether this can be more easily accomplished for emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants is an important enquiry for future studies.","Coleman, K.

Malignant T-cells may overexpress programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), which signals via programmed death-1 (PD-1) receptor, and provides an inhibitory signal on normal T-cells further suppressing antitumor immunity. They can also express PD1 which may act as a tumor suppressor on malignant T-cells (Wartewig et al, Nature 2017). Thus, blocking the PD1/PDL1 synapse in PTCL may lead to tumor regression or progression. The NIVEAU trial is an ongoing international, multicenter, randomized, open label, phase 3 study testing Nivolumab (Nivo) in combination with (Rituximab), Gemcitabine, Oxaliplatin ((R-)GemOx) for patients with aggressive (B and T-cell) Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma in first relapse or progression not eligible for High-Dose Chemotherapy (NCT03366272). Here, we performed a preliminary analysis of the experimental arm (Nivo-GemOx) of the PTCL cohort to assess the safety and efficacy of this regimen in this population. Methods Key eligibility criteria include: first relapse or progression of peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL), ineligibility for high dose therapy (defined as >65 years of age or older than 18 years if HCT-CI score > 2), only one prior chemotherapy regimen including an anthracycline. Pts were planned to receive 8 cycles Nivolumab (3mg/kg) plus Gemcitabine and Oxaliplatin in 2-wk intervals followed by additional 18 Nivolumab (3mg/kg) biweekly as consolidation or until progression. Response was evaluated after 4 and 8 cycles of GemOx. Each progression/relapse of PTCL had to be reported as a SAE. Results The analysis (data cut-off 13-July-2020) included 12 PTCL pts enrolled in the experimental arm (Table 1): 4 (33%) PTCL NOS, 3 (25%) AITL, 1 (8%) PTCL TFH-type, 2 (17%) ALCL ALK-, 1 (8%) EATL, and 1 (8%) MEITL. Median age was 69.5 years (range, 53-80), 7 (58%) patients were male, 2 (17%) had received a prior autologous stem cell transplantation, and 5 (42%) were refractory to first line therapy. At enrollment, performance status was 0-1 in 9 (75%) pts and 2 in 3 (25%) pts, 11 (92%) had Ann Arbor stage III-IV, 2 (17%) had B-symptoms, 7 (58%) had more than one extra-nodal site and 4 (33%) had elevated LDH. PD1 and PD-L1 were expressed by the tumor cells in 6/10 (60%) and 2/11 (18%) patients, respectively (Table 1). Pts have received a median of 6 (1-8) cycles of GemOx and 7 (1-26) infusions of nivolumab. Treatment was prematurely discontinued in 9 pts (7 during induction and 2 during consolidation), due to lymphoma progression (n=6), toxicity (n=2) and an intercurrent disease (n=1). There were 26 SAE in 10 patients, including 8 progressive diseases. Nine (75%) patients achieved an objective response (4 CR and 5 PR). Two patients (pt 9: MEITL PD1-negative;and pt 12: PTCL-NOS strongly PD1-positive) experienced primary progression upon Nivo-GemOx (Table 1). Median PFS2 (time from randomisation to 2nd rel/prog/death) was 6.9 months (95% CI: 1.9-11.9) vs 7.7 months (95% CI: 7.2-8.2) for PFS1 (time from diagnosis to 1st rel/prog). PFS2 was superior to PFS1 in 2 out of 8 patients (25%), and not informative in 4 pts: 3 who are still on therapy (ongoing PFS) and 1 who died prematurely due to infection (pt 8) (Figure 1). Median OS was 24.8 months (95% CI: 0-49.8). After a median follow-up of 22.8 months, 7 patients have died (5 from lymphoma and 2 from infection (1 COVID-19 infection and 1 yeast septicemia)), and 5 remain alive. Conclusions Nivolumab in combination with GemOx was well tolerated in PTCL. The response rate and PFS2 (compared to PFS1) are encouraging. Marked differences in PFS2 might reflect heterogeneity of biology and susceptibility to PD-1 blockade in combination with GemOx chemotherapy. Furthermore, the translational research program of the study might help to identify markers which are predictive for efficacy of PD-1 blockade in PTCL. This phase 3 trial is actively enrolling patients and an update of these results will be presented at the meeting. Disclosure: ISR fin ncially supported by Bristol Myers Squibb.

These thromboembolic conditions are responsible for 1 in 4 deaths world-wide. This problem is also of significant current interest as 1 in 3 COVID-19 intensive care patients exhibit thromboembolic complications. Thrombus resistance to fracture is driven by its intrinsic fracture toughness as well as other, non-surface-creating dissipative mechanisms. In our current work, we identify and quantify these latter mechanisms toward future studies that aim to delineate fracture from other forms of dissipation. To this end, we use an in vitro thrombus mimic system to produce whole blood clots and explore their dissipative mechanics under simple uniaxial extension, cyclic loading, and stress-relaxation. We found that whole blood clots exhibit Mullins effect, hysteresis, permanent set, strain-rate dependence, and nonlinear stress-relaxation. Interestingly, we found that performing these tests under dry or submerged conditions did not change our results. However, performing these tests under room temperature or body temperature conditions yielded differences. Overall, we have demonstrated that whole blood clots show several dissipative phenomena - similarly to hydrogels - that will be critical to our understanding of thrombus fracture.","Sugerman, Gabriella P.; Parekh, Sapun H.; Rausch, Manuel K.",bioRxiv,283,27

Many if not most medical schools have placed significant limitations on direct patient contact by medical students which may persist indefinitely. Novel approaches are required to provide students with clinical experience. In response to this need, a case-based fourth year medical student (M4) elective was developed. Description of elective: In the first five offerings of the elective, two to nine M4 students enrolled. M4 electives are scheduled to begin on Mondays. On the first Monday morning, following a brief orientation, a lecture on aspects of the physical examination relevant to Hematology (such as physical findings of anemia, polycythemia, thrombocytopenia, lymph node examination, and spleen palpation) was presented using the Zoom application. Otherwise, the structure of Monday-Thursday sessions were identical. Each morning by 730 AM, students received an email containing a brief PowerPoint representing the information that was known to the Hematology attending at the time of initial clinic or inpatient referral. All identifiers were removed from the PowerPoint. All cases represented patients actually followed by the elective's faculty member (RTM). Students were expected to research the case and be prepared with additional history questions and additional laboratory tests. For tests requested, students were expected to have a plan for follow-up testing based on the different possible results. Students were also expected to have a differential diagnosis and, where appropriate, a proposal about whether treatment was indicated. At 1PM each day, students and the faculty member assembled on Zoom. After class discussion of the patient's presentation, diagnostic evaluation, and differential diagnosis. Images of blood and bone marrow were provide when appropriate. This segued into a discussion of the natural history, pathophysiology, and treatment of the patient's clinical diagnosis illustrated by the patient's results and clinical course. Rationale for the clinical decisions made were presented and discussed. Following the discussion, students were provided a copy of the discussion PowerPoint and copies of relevant references. For each case, students were expected to provide a reflective statement indicating what they had known before the case, what they had learned, and issues about which they had additional questions. The students were also asked to submit a diagnostic algorithm for the clinical topic discussed that is relevant for their residency career choice. Fridays used a different approach. The faculty physician presented an evolving case on Zoom in an effort to replicate something comparable to a real-time clinic experience. A microscope with a web-camera attachment was used to review the patient blood films. An example of elective topics in one offering of the elective is shown in Table 1. Results: Over the first five offerings of the selective, 30% of the M4 class participated. Three additional offerings are planned in this academic year. Students represented a diverse array of residency aspirations (Table 2), reflecting career aspirations of the overall class. End-of-elective feedback from students was uniformly positive. Features of the elective eliciting favorable comment included that these were real cases;the structure of the Monday - Thursday cases replicating a ward or clinic type experience (student “sees” the patient in the morning and then discusses the case at “attending rounds” in the afternoon);explication of clinical correlations of laboratory tests and their underlying mechanisms;the opportunity to think through the diagnosis while developing the algorithm for each case;feedback on the algorithms and reflective statements;and to the “real-time” nature of the evolving case. Suggestions for improvement mostly reflected a wish that additional areas be covered (lymphoma, acute leukemia and pediatric Hematology). Conclusions: The Covid-19 pandemic has created a need for creative approaches to clinical education and medical students. Hematology, with its strong connection to the diagnostic laboratory, is ideally situated to provide clinical exposure that allows clear correlation between patient presentation and natural history, foundational basic science, the diagnostic laboratory, and clinical management.

With church gatherings playing a vital role in the nature of Christianity in the Filipino culture, the advent of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic in the Philippines posed challenges to public religious practices amid efforts to mitigate COVID-19 community transmission. Various policy pronouncements from both the government-led Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) on Emerging Diseases and the church-led Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) were issued. These guidelines were implemented in order to address the two-pronged problem on healthcare and religious obligations. While these guidelines were initially contributory to the mitigation of disease transmission, varied compliance by Filipinos was observed through the progression of the pandemic. Considering the value that church gatherings and religion play in the lives of the Filipino people, further studies on COVID-19 transmission in the church should be conducted in order to develop more efficient policies and guidelines on the practice of religion, particularly for religious gatherings.

Hence, the present study aimed at assessing communication strategies used by Ethiopian Public Health Institute and Ministry of Health to address COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, make analysis of vaccination messages, and hybrid media messages to label best practices of communication techniques to address vaccine hesitancy. To attain this objective, a qualitative research method was employed to analyze messages that were disseminated with the hybrid national and regional media and social media platforms. MOH and EPHI disseminated messages;ministers, prominent people, opinion leaders and activists' speeches used as subjects of the study. COVID-19 vaccination messages were selected through purposive sampling method. The contents of messages regarding health communication were analyzed. The finding showed that building COVID-19 vaccine acceptance through effective communication is important to stop the spread of the virus. The participatory and presumptive style communications are the possible method to promote COVID-19 vaccination before it reaches on refusal stage. Moreover, the results revealed that communication strategies contributed to vaccine advocacy and vaccination campaign to improve vaccine acceptance. MOH and EPHI used the hybrid media to mold the unscientific information and the misinformation of the vaccine. In sum, using effective communication strategies is very important to create awareness about COVID-19 vaccines, and avoid vaccine hesitation to strength the public vaccines acceptability.","Yemer, D.

Prospects for Big Oil to align emissions with a 1.5 degrees C pathway",15.431665,2.316074,2021,"BackgroundThe emergence of a novel SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern called B.1.1.7 lineage sparked global alarm due to evidence of increased transmissibility, mortality, and uncertainty about vaccine efficacy, thus accelerating efforts to detect and track the variant. Current approaches to detect lineage B.1.1.7 include sequencing and RT-qPCR tests containing a target assay that fails or results in reduced sensitivity towards the B.1.1.7 variant. AimSince many countries lack robust genomic surveillance programs and failed assays detect multiple unrelated variants containing similar mutations as B.1.1.7, we sought to develop an RT-qPCR test that can accurately and rapidly differentiate the B.1.1.7 variant from other SARS-CoV-2 variants. MethodsWe used bioinformatics, allele-specific PCR, and judicious placement of LNA-modified nucleotides to develop a test that differentiates B.1.1.7 from other SARS-CoV-2 variants. We validated the test on 106 clinical samples with lineage status confirmed by sequencing and conducted a surveillance study of B.1.1.7 lineage prevalence in Slovakia. ResultsOur multiplexed RT-qPCR test showed 97% clinical sensitivity at detecting lineage B.1.1.7. The assay was used in a country-wide surveillance of B.1.1.7 lineage spread in Slovakia. Retesting nearly 7,000 SARS-CoV-2 positive samples obtained during three campaigns performed within a one month period, revealed pervasive spread of B.1.1.7 with an average prevalence of 82%. ConclusionLabs can easily implement this test to rapidly scale B.1.1.7 surveillance efforts and it is particularly useful in countries with high prevalence of variants possessing only the {Delta}H69/{Delta}V70 deletion because current strategies using target failure assays incorrectly identify these as putative B.1.1.7 variants.","Kovacova, Viera; Boršová, Kristína; Paul, Evan D; Radvanszka, Monika; Hajdu, Roman; Čabanová, Viktória; Sláviková, Monika; Ličková, Martina; Lukáčiková, Ľubomíra; Belak, Andrej; Roussier, Lucia; Kostičová, Michaela; Líšková, Anna; Maďarová, Lucia; Štefkovičová, Mária; Reizigová, Lenka; Nováková, Elena; Sabaka, Peter; Koščálová, Alena; Brejová, Broňa; Staroňová, Edita; Mišík, Matej; Vinar, Tomas; Nosek, Jozef; Cekan, Pavol; Klempa, Boris",,283,1

A typical approach for predicting patients’ outcomes relies on clinical scores such as the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). CCI-based triaging is a reliable approach for estimating the mortality risk in the general patients’ population. However, this score is not optimized for predicting mortality in specific populations such as the one represented by COVID inpatients, often the most represented population in the emergency department cohorts during the current pandemic. Motivated by this, this chapter describes the development of a new COVID-19-specific clinical score: The General Assessment of SARS-CoV-2 patients Score (GASS). The score builds on the clinical experience gained during the first phase of the pandemic, and it is based on both clinical and laboratory data. It was aimed at predicting the 30-day mortality outcome of hospitalized COVID-19 patients and showed markedly better accuracy than the CCI. Furthermore, this chapter introduces an additional predictive model based on a classical Computational Intelligence method. Specifically, it describes the development and validation of a feedforward artificial Neural Network (NN) that automatically maps patients’ clinical and laboratory data to a 30-day mortality-risk score. Critically, the NN-based method was shown to be more accurate at predicting 30-day mortality of COVID-19 patients than both the CCI and GASS scores. However, the intrinsic black-box nature of the NN-based method makes it hard to reach an intuitive understanding of the internal computations underlying its decision process. This might affect its general acceptance among clinicians, and lead them to prefer using the GASS score. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Greco, S.; Salatiello, A.; Fabbri, N.; Passaro, A.",Studies in Computational Intelligence,283,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS Five hundred and ninety-three respondents attending the National Healthcare Group Polyclinics (NHGP) participated in the survey from 9 to 13 June 2003. Associations between awareness of SARS symptoms and (i) first action to be taken and (ii) mode of transportation used, if the respondent was suspected of having SARS, were analysed using Chi-square or Fisher's exact tests. Logistic regression was performed to adjust for relevant covariates. RESULTS The majority (92.7%) of the respondents were aware of SARS symptoms. Television (91.6%), newspaper (65.2%) and radio (30.4%) formed the top 3 sources of information on SARS. Slightly more than half (51.6%) of those who suspect themselves of having SARS would choose to visit their primary health care doctors, while 22.7% of the respondents would go to Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH). If they suspected themselves to have SARS, most (84.9%) of the 578 respondents would react appropriately by taking the SARS ambulance or driving themselves to TTSH. However, 60 respondents would nonetheless take public transport to TTSH [by taxi 8.5%, mass rapid transit (MRT) or bus 1.9%]. In particular, the retired with lower educational levels were likely to be oblivious both to the symptoms of SARS and the possible consequences of travelling by inappropriate transport. CONCLUSION Despite more than 2 months of intensive SARS public education in Singapore, there remain important gaps in knowledge and appropriate behaviour that have to be bridged.","Seng, S L; Lim, P S; Ng, M Y; Wong, H B; Emmanuel, S C","Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore",283,16

In this premise, we studied the prognostic value of two markers of iron metabolism ferritin and hemoglobin. METHODOLOGY A retrospective-cohort study was carried out in a tertiary hospital in northern India involving 210 hospitalized COVID-19 patients aged 15-and above. Analysis was done for clinical profile, comorbidities and basic laboratory indices including ferritin-hemoglobin ratio (FHR) with primary end-point being in-hospital all-cause mortality. RESULTS Median serum ferritin levels (640.00ng/mL vs 220.00ng/mL) were significantly higher among non-survivors as against survivors while median hemoglobin levels were significantly lower (12.12g/dL vs 13.73g/dL). Serum ferritin levels >400ng/mL (Sn 80%, Sp 70%) predicted mortality with high sensitivity and specificity. Notably, serum ferritin levels >400ng/mL (HR 11.075 [1.481-82.801]) and anemia, defined as a hemoglobin of <12g/dL for females and < 13g/dL for males and were significantly associated with the risk of mortality in a univariable Cox-proportional hazards regression. The median FHR was significantly higher among non-survivors compared to survivors (56.98 vs 17.17). FHR>31 (Sn 85% Sp 71.6%) was highly sensitive and specific for predicting mortality. The multivariable analysis indicated that FHR >31 remained an independent risk factor for mortality (HR 12.293 [3.147-48.028]). CONCLUSION Ferritin-hemoglobin ratio (FHR), which encompasses into a single index, the effects of both elevated levels of ferritin and the severity of anemia, seems to perform particularly well as a prognostic marker and emerged as an independent risk factor for mortality in COVID-19 patients. Hyperferritinemia and anemia, both, are inexorably interlinked in addition to having a role, directly or indirectly in the disease pathophysiology. Ferritin and hemoglobin, hence should be seen as two sides of the same coin rather than as two discrete entities.","Raman, Nishant; Kv, Padmaprakash; Ashta, Kuldeep Kumar; Vardhan, Vasu; Thareja, Sandeep; J, Muthukrishnan; Kumar, Abhinav; Basavaraj,",The Journal of the Association of Physicians of India,283,21

We have now identified, after 21 serial undiluted passages of MHV, a small DI RNA, DIssF, which is efficiently packaged into virions. The DIssF RNA replicated at a high efficiency on its transfection into the helper virus-infected cells. The virus released from the transfected cells interfered strongly with mRNA synthesis and growth of helper virus. cDNA cloning and sequence analysis of DIssF RNA revealed that it is 3.6 kb and consists of sequences derived from five discontinuous regions of the genome of the nondefective virus. The first four regions (domains I to IV) from the 5' end are derived from gene 1, which presumably encodes the RNA polymerase of the nondefective virus. The entire domain I (859 nucleotides) and the first 750 nucleotides of domain II are also present in a previously characterized DI RNA, DIssE, which is not efficiently packaged into virions. Furthermore, the junction between these two domains is identical between the two DI RNAs. The remaining 77 nucleotides at the 3' end of domain II and all of domains III (655 nucleotides) and IV (770 nucleotides) are not present in DIssE RNA. These four domains are derived from gene 1. In contrast, the 3'-most domain (domain V, 447 nucleotides) is derived from the 3' end of the genomic RNA and is also present in DIssE. The comparison of primary sequences and packaging properties between DIsse and DIssF RNAs suggested that domains III and IV and part of the 3' end of domain II contain the packaging signal for MHV RNA. This conclusion was confirmed by inserting these DIssF-unique sequences into a DIssE cDNA construct; the in vitro-transcribed RNA from this hybrid construct was efficiently packaged into virion particles. DIssF RNA also contains an open reading frame, which begins from domain I and ends at the 5'-end 20 bases of domain III. In vitro translation of DIssF RNA and metabolic labeling of the virus-infected cells showed that this open reading frame is indeed translated into a 75-kDa protein. The structures of both DIssE and DIssF RNAs suggest that a protein-encoding capability is a common characteristic of MHV DI RNA.","Makino, S; Yokomori, K; Lai, M M",Journal of virology,283,12

To further our knowledge about mechanisms of viral RNA genome variability, in this paper we have studied homologous recombination in BMV RNA1 and RNA2 components during infection. We have found that basal RNA-RNA crossovers could occur within coding regions of both RNAs, although recombination frequencies slightly varied at different RNA sections. In all cases, the frequencies were much lower than the rate observed for the intercistronic recombination hot spot in BMV RNA3. Probability calculations accounted for at least one homologous crossover per RNA molecule per replication cycle. In addition, we have demonstrated an efficient repair of mutations within the conserved 3' and 5' noncoding regions, most likely due to error-prone BMV RNA replication. Overall, our data verify that homologous crossovers are common events a during virus life cycle, and we discuss their importance for viral RNA genetics.","Urbanowicz, Anna; Alejska, Magdalena; Formanowicz, Piotr; Blazewicz, Jacek; Figlerowicz, Marek; Bujarski, Jozef J",Journal of virology,283,1

In many settings, however, knowledge of the true status of disease is not possible and accuracy is evaluated against the interpretations of an expert panel. Common statistical approaches to evaluate accuracy include receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and kappa analysis but both of these methods have significant limitations and cannot answer the question of equivalence: Is the CAD performance equivalent to that of an expert? The goal of this study is to show the strength of log-linear analysis over standard ROC and kappa statistics in evaluating the accuracy of computer-aided diagnosis of renal obstruction compared to the diagnosis provided by expert readers. METHODS: Log-linear modeling was utilized to analyze a previously published database that used ROC and kappa statistics to compare diuresis renography scan interpretations (non-obstructed, equivocal, or obstructed) generated by a renal expert system (RENEX) in 185 kidneys (95 patients) with the independent and consensus scan interpretations of three experts who were blinded to clinical information and prospectively and independently graded each kidney as obstructed, equivocal, or non-obstructed. RESULTS: Log-linear modeling showed that RENEX and the expert consensus had beyond-chance agreement in both non-obstructed and obstructed readings (both p < 0.0001). Moreover, pairwise agreement between experts and pairwise agreement between each expert and RENEX were not significantly different (p = 0.41, 0.95, 0.81 for the non-obstructed, equivocal, and obstructed categories, respectively). Similarly, the three-way agreement of the three experts and three-way agreement of two experts and RENEX was not significantly different for non-obstructed (p = 0.79) and obstructed (p = 0.49) categories. CONCLUSION: Log-linear modeling showed that RENEX was equivalent to any expert in rating kidneys, particularly in the obstructed and non-obstructed categories. This conclusion, which could not be derived from the original ROC and kappa analysis, emphasizes and illustrates the role and importance of log-linear modeling in the absence of a gold standard. The log-linear analysis also provides additional evidence that RENEX has the potential to assist in the interpretation of diuresis renography studies.","Manatunga, Amita K; Binongo, José Nilo G; Taylor, Andrew T",EJNMMI research,283,16

Methods: The epidemiology, clinical symptoms, atory and radiologic data of 150 patients with 2019-nCoV infection admitted to the designated hospitals in Nanyang City from January 24,2020 to February 16, 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. Results: The 150 patients with 2019 nCov infection consisted of 67 men and 83 women, and the median age was (45±16) years; 69 of them were the first generation case,60 of them were the second generation case, 6 of them were the third generation case,the median incubation period of the first generation case was (5.4±2.2) days, and the second generation case was (6.7±3.1) days, and the first-generation cases are the majority in severe patients (69%) . The most common basic disease was hypertension (13 cases, 9%), diabetes (9 cases, 6%), and the most common symptom is fever(142 cases, 95%, 63% showed moderate fever) , cough and sputum(108 cases,72%), fatigue(23 cases,15%), anorexia(20 cases, 13%), headache, diarrhea, muscle soreness, sore throat as the first symptoms. The average time from onset of symptoms to consultation was (4.2±2.2) days for all patients. The changes in peripheral blood cells were mainly lymphonpenia (83 cases, 55%) and eosinophilia (95 cases, 63%), The lymphocyte count of the severe and critically ill patients was more significantly reduced, and some patients had increased myocardial enzymes, mainly LDH (47 cases, 31%), and a few patients had liver function damage, mainly manifested in ALT and AST. High, very few patients have renal impairment. Among the inflammation-related indicators, the main manifestations are increased CRP (66 cases, 43%) and ESR (86 cases, 57%), elevated D-Dimer in 29% of patients. 144 cases have different degrees of infective lesions in chest CT examination, with 30 cases (21%) on one side and 144 cases (79%) on both sides. Morphologically, most of the lesions were patchy ground glass lesions, which could be accompanied by air bronchus signs and some consolidation and paving stone signs. Of the cases showing ""white lung"", 87% were sever ill or critically ill. After active treatment, 45% of patients were discharged according to discharge standards. 33% of sever and critically ill patients were discharged, 49% of them were degraded hospitalization.The average length of hospitalization was (12±4) days. Conclusion: A history of epidemiological exposure, fever, chest CT with signs of pneumonia, normal or decreased WBC, and lymphocytopenia, eosinophilia are the clinical basis for the diagnosis of this disease, and most of the sever patients were the first generation cases. The degree of lymphocytopenia is related to the severity of the disease.","Sun, C; Zhang, X B; Dai, Y; Xu, X Z; Zhao, J",Zhonghua Jie He He Hu Xi Za Zhi,283,24

The primary detection technique for SARS-CoV-2, the reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-based approach, requires expensive reagents and equipment and skilled personnel. In addition, for SARS-CoV-2 detection, specimens are usually shipped to a designated laboratory for testing, which may extend the diagnosis and treatment time of patients with COVID-19. The latest research shows that clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-based approaches can quickly provide visual, rapid, ultrasensitive, and specific detection of SARS-CoV-2 at isothermal conditions. Therefore, CRISPR-based approaches are expected to be developed as attractive alternatives to conventional RT-PCR methods for the efficient and accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2. Recent advances in the field of CRISPR-based biosensing technologies for SARS-CoV-2 detection and insights into their potential use in many applications are reviewed in this article.","Zhang, Wancun; Liu, Kangbo; Zhang, Pin; Cheng, Weyland; Li, Linfei; Zhang, Fan; Yu, Zhidan; Li, Lifeng; Zhang, Xianwei",,283,16

This review describes the main clinical features of COVID-19 and potential role of microbiota in COVID-19. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have 79.5% nucleotide sequence identity and use angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors to enter host cells. The distribution of ACE2 may determine how SARS-CoV-2 infects the respiratory and digestive tract. SARS and COVID-19 share similar clinical features, although the estimated fatality rate of COVID-19 is much lower. The communication between the microbiota and SARS-CoV-2 and the role of this association in diagnosis and treatment are unclear. Changes in the lung microbiota were identified in COVID-19 patients, and the enrichment of the lung microbiota with bacteria found in the intestinal tract is correlated with the onset of acute respiratory distress syndrome and long-term outcomes. ACE2 regulates the gut microbiota by indirectly controlling the secretion of antimicrobial peptides. Moreover, the gut microbiota enhances antiviral immunity by increasing the number and function of immune cells, decreasing immunopathology, and stimulating interferon production. In turn, respiratory viruses are known to influence microbial composition in the lung and intestine. Therefore, the analysis of changes in the microbiota during SARS-CoV-2 infection may help predict patient outcomes and allow the development of microbiota-based therapies.","He, Yu; Wang, Jianhui; Li, Fang; Shi, Yuan",Front.

However, longitudinal research is needed to test changes in mental health and determine factors that contribute to change. The purpose of this study was to compare anxiety, depression, and stress pre-pandemic to during the pandemic within the same sample and identify predictors of change (i.e., disease threat, changes to daily life, social isolation, financial worries). METHOD: Three national samples of U.S. adults were recruited through an online platform (Amazon's Mechanical Turk). Participants completed online surveys pre-pandemic (September - December 2019) and during the pandemic(April - June 2020). RESULTS: Across the three samples, mini-meta analyses revealed significant increases in anxiety and stress (Cohen's ds = 0.17, 0.16, respectively; ps < 0.01). Financial concern and effects of COVID-19 on daily life predicted higher levels of depression, anxiety, and stress during the pandemic across all three samples (ds = 0.24, 0.40, and 0.40, respectively; ps < 0.001). LIMITATIONS: Response rates for follow-up surveys were relatively low, with some noted differences between those who did and did not complete both surveys. CONCLUSIONS: Significant increases in anxiety and stress were observed across three samples of U.S. adults from before to during the COVID-19 pandemic. Financial concern and effects of the pandemic on daily life emerged as the most consistent predictors of psychological distress across these samples.","Haliwa, Ilana; Wilson, Jenna; Lee, Jerin; Shook, Natalie J",J Affect Disord,283,24

In the U.S., residential recovery homes for persons with alcohol and drug disorders are good examples of high-risk environments where virus mitigation procedures are essential. The National Alliance for Recovery Residences (NARR) has taken recommendations developed by the Center for Disease Control (CDC) and applied them to recovery home settings. This paper describes how COVID-19 mitigation efforts in recovery homes may be influenced by two factors. First, while some houses are licensed by states with rigorous health and safety standards, others are not licensed and are subject to less oversight. These homes may be more inconsistent in adhering to mitigation standards. Second, to varying degrees, recovery homes use a social model approach to recovery that contrasts with mitigation procedures such as social distancing and stay-at-home orders. This paper provides examples of ways recovery homes have been forced to adjust to the competing demands of mitigation efforts and social model recovery. The paper also identifies multiple questions that could be addressed by provider-researcher coalitions to inform how social model recovery can navigate forward during the era of COVID-19. As we move forward during the era of COVID-19, providers are encouraged to remember that recovery homes have a history of resilience facing adversity and in fact have their origins in grassroots responses to the challenges of their times.","Polcin, Douglas L; Mahoney, Elizabeth; Wittman, Friedner; Sheridan, Dave; Mericle, Amy A",Int J Drug Policy,283,16

The cardiac injury is a common condition among the hospitalized patients with COVID-19. However, whether N terminal pro B type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) predicted outcome of severe COVID-19 patients was unknown. METHODS: The study initially enrolled 102 patients with severe COVID-19 from a continuous sample. After screening out the ineligible cases, 54 patients were analyzed in this study. The primary outcome was in-hospital death defined as the case fatality rate. Research information and following-up data were obtained from their medical records. RESULTS: The best cut-off value of NT-proBNP for predicting in-hospital death was 88.64 pg/mL with the sensitivity for 100% and the specificity for 66.67%. Patients with high NT-proBNP values (> 88.64 pg/mL) had a significantly increased risk of death during the days of following-up compared with those with low values (&#8804;88.64 pg/mL).

The blame-game is symptomatic of contradictory global imaginaries circulated within distinct geopolitical spaces. This article approaches Chinese disinformation narratives as transnational and intertextual constructs, which involve the practices of (mis)translating and referencing foreign source texts to paradoxically delegitimate the foreign, especially Western, Other;they reinforce what I call self-serving cosmopolitanism, a narcissistic and locally conditioned sense of global consciousness that is oriented towards the consolidation of self-identity and pride. It is my contention that, to combat global disinformation about COVID-19, we should foreground the politics of translation, enhance cross-cultural sensibility, and most importantly, mobilize a kind of counter-politics against the xenophobic nationalism that disinformation narratives often parasitize. Cultural scholars with comparative perspectives are well positioned to take the initiative in revealing the structural issues at play within a global context and in promoting genuine cosmopolitan openness.","Zou, Sheng",Cultural Studies,283,29

The virus started from a single human being in China, is now increasing globally at a rate of 3% to 5% daily and has become a never ending process. Some studies even predict that the virus will stay with us forever. India being the second most populous country of the world, is also not saved, and the virus is spreading as a community level transmitter. Therefore, it become really important to analyse the possible impact of COVID-19 in India and forecast how it will behave in the days to come. In present work, prediction models based on genetic programming (GP) have been developed for confirmed cases (CC) and death cases (DC) across three most affected states namely Maharashtra, Gujarat and Delhi as well as whole India. The proposed prediction models are presented using explicit formula, and impotence of prediction variables are studied. Here, statistical parameters and metrics have been used for evaluated and validate the evolved models. From the results, it has been found that the proposed GEP-based models use simple linkage functions and are highly reliable for time series prediction of COVID-19 cases in India.","Salgotra, Rohit; Gandomi, Mostafa; Gandomi, Amir H",Chaos Solitons Fractals,283,21

Social justice in catastrophe requires strong social insurance structures and legal protections for the most vulnerable people, who would otherwise lack economic resources and political influence to protect their essential interests. Social justice also requires greater and more sustained attention to disaster preparedness and public health infrastructure-both of which are characteristically neglected, in part because the public health enterprise is identified with politically weak and often stigmatized populations.","Pollack, Harold A",J Health Polit Policy Law,283,30

DESIGN: Publicly available register-based ecological study. SETTING: Two hundred and nine countries/territories in the world. PARTICIPANTS: Aggregated data including 10 445 656 confirmed COVID-19 cases. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: COVID-19 CFR and crude cause-specific death rate were calculated using country-level data from the Our World in Data website. RESULTS: The average of country/territory-specific COVID-19 CFR is about 2%-3% worldwide and higher than previously reported at 0.7%-1.3%. A doubling in size of a population is associated with a 0.48% (95% CI 0.25% to 0.70%) increase in COVID-19 CFR, and a doubling in the proportion of female smokers is associated with a 0.55% (95% CI 0.09% to 1.02%) increase in COVID-19 CFR. The open testing policies are associated with a 2.23% (95% CI 0.21% to 4.25%) decrease in CFR. The strictness of anti-COVID-19 measures was not statistically significantly associated with CFR overall, but the higher Stringency Index was associated with higher CFR in higher-income countries with active testing policies (regression coefficient beta=0.14, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.27). Inverse associations were found between cardiovascular disease death rate and diabetes prevalence and CFR. CONCLUSION: The association between population size and COVID-19 CFR may imply the healthcare strain and lower treatment efficiency in countries with large populations. The observed association between smoking in women and COVID-19 CFR might be due to the finding that the proportion of female smokers reflected broadly the income level of a country. When testing is warranted and healthcare resources are sufficient, strict quarantine and/or lockdown measures might result in excess deaths in underprivileged populations. Spatial dependence and temporal trends in the data should be taken into account in global joint strategy and/or policy making against the COVID-19 pandemic.","Cao, Yang; Hiyoshi, Ayako; Montgomery, Scott",BMJ Open,283,1

The outbreak was traced to a seafood wholesale market and human to human transmission was confirmed. The rapid spread and the death toll of the new epidemic warrants immediate intervention. The intra-host genomic variability of SARS-CoV-2 plays a pivotal role in the development of effective antiviral agents and vaccines, as well as in the design of accurate diagnostics. We analyzed NGS data derived from clinical samples of three Chinese patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, in order to identify small- and large-scale intra-host variations in the viral genome. We identified tens of low- or higher- frequency single nucleotide variations (SNVs) with variable density across the viral genome, affecting 7 out of 10 protein-coding viral genes. The majority of these SNVs (72/104) corresponded to missense changes. The annotation of the identified SNVs but also of all currently circulating strain variations revealed colocalization of intra-host as well as strain specific SNVs with primers and probes currently used in molecular diagnostics assays. Moreover, we de-novo assembled the viral genome, in order to isolate and validate intra-host structural variations and recombination breakpoints. The bioinformatics analysis disclosed genomic rearrangements over poly-A / poly-U regions located in ORF1ab and spike (S) gene, including a potential recombination hot-spot within S gene. Our results highlight the intra-host genomic diversity and plasticity of SARS-CoV-2, pointing out genomic regions that are prone to alterations. The isolated SNVs and genomic rearrangements reflect the intra-patient capacity of the polymorphic quasispecies, which may arise rapidly during the outbreak, allowing immunological escape of the virus, offering resistance to anti-viral drugs and affecting the sensitivity of the molecular diagnostics assays.","Karamitros, Timokratis; Papadopoulou, Gethsimani; Bousali, Maria; Mexias, Anastasios; Tsiodras, Sotirios; Mentis, Andreas",J Clin Virol,283,3

Included in the introductory section of the lesson were two short (&lt; 2 min), relevant YouTube videos. Together with the Boys and Girls Club STEM director who was on-site the students were directed through some hands-on activities followed by a discussion of how to keep their respiratory systems healthy. In order to illustrate the concept of gas exchange to the students, they participated in a Gas Exchange Relay race where students were split into 3 different groups, one representing the lungs, one representing an organ, and the third representing a red blood cell who would transfer colored marbles representative of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the other 2 students. Additionally, to demonstrate the relationship between breathing rate and exercise level, the students were asked to count how many times they exhaled during a 20 second period before and after running in place for 30 seconds and then the increase in amount of breaths was explained. The students were excited to have ?guest speakers? come and participated in all the activities. These hands-on activities kept the students mentally engaged while also focusing them to think about physiological processes.

Optimising and standardising management through evidence-based guidelines may improve quality of care and therefore patient outcomes. METHODS: A task force from the European Respiratory Society and endorsed by the Chinese Thoracic Society identified priority interventions (pharmacological and non-pharmacological) for the initial version of this ""living guideline"" using the PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcome) format. The GRADE approach was used for assessing the quality of evidence and strength of recommendations. Systematic literature reviews were performed, and data pooled by meta-analysis where possible. Evidence tables were presented and evidence to decision frameworks were used to formulate recommendations. RESULTS: Based on the available evidence at the time of guideline development (20 February, 2021), the panel makes a strong recommendation in favour of the use of systemic corticosteroids in patients requiring supplementary oxygen or ventilatory support, and for the use of anticoagulation in hospitalised patients. The panel makes a conditional recommendation for interleukin (IL)-6 receptor antagonist monoclonal antibody treatment and high-flow nasal oxygen or continuous positive airway pressure in patients with hypoxaemic respiratory failure. The panel make strong recommendations against the use of hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir-ritonavir. Conditional recommendations are made against the use of azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine combined with azithromycin, colchicine, and remdesivir, in the latter case specifically in patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation. No recommendation was made for remdesivir in patients requiring supplemental oxygen. Further recommendations for research are made. CONCLUSION: The evidence base for management of COVID-19 now supports strong recommendations in favour and against specific interventions. These guidelines will be regularly updated as further evidence becomes available.","Chalmers, James D; Crichton, Megan L; Goeminne, Pieter C; Cao, Bin; Humbert, Marc; Shteinberg, Michal; Antoniou, Katerina M; Ulrik, Charlotte Suppli; Parks, Helen; Wang, Chen; Vandendriessche, Thomas; Qu, Jieming; Stolz, Daiana; Brightling, Christopher; Welte, Tobias; Aliberti, Stefano; Simonds, Anita K; Tonia, Thomy; Roche, Nicolas",Eur. respir. j,283,16

There are no data about parents' SM practices for their children's dental problems during the COVID-19 pandemic. The present study aims to evaluate parents' knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding self-medication for their children's dental problems during the COVID-19 pandemic in Northern Turkey. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was carried out in the pediatric dental clinic at Ondokuz Mayis University, Faculty of Dentistry, Department of Pediatric Dentistry, immediately after the COVID-19 lockdown ended. A total of 389 parents who agreed to participate in the study completed the questionnaire from July 1 to October 1. A questionnaire with 18 items was designed to collect information on the parents' knowledge and attitudes regarding when, why, and how to use drugs and on their practices on medicating their children. The collected data were analyzed using descriptive and analytical statistics (chi-square test). RESULTS: The majority of parents (n = 273; 70.2%) practiced self-medication for their children's dental problems. Self-medication with a previously prescribed medications was usually preferred by parents (n = 179; 62.2%). Analgesics (98%) were the most commonly used medicines by parents in their self-medication for their children's dental problems. CONCLUSION: Prevalence of self-medication practices for children's dental problems is high in Turkey during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, new healthcare services, such as teledentistry, may be useful to overcome problems related to the self-medication of children during times when the ability to reach healthcare providers is limited, such as during pandemics.","Sen Tunc, Emine; Aksoy, Emre; Arslan, Hatice Nilden; Kaya, Zeynep",BMC Oral Health,283,1

In its complete setup, the system consists of an application running on the smartwatch and a wearable accessory. Its ease of implementation allows this solution to be ready-to-use and large-scale deployable. We developed two gesture detection approaches compatible with sensors embedded in recent smartwatches, i.e. inertial and magnetic sensors. After preliminary tests to tune target gesture parameters, we tested the two approaches and compared their accuracy. The final phase of this project consisted in exploiting the most robust approach in a daily living scenario during a 6-days campaign.

Observational studies suggest indolent cardiovascular involvement after recovery from acute COVID-19. However, these findings may reflect pre-existing cardiac phenotypes. AIMS: We tested the association of baseline cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) phenotypes with incident COVID-19. METHODS: We studied UK Biobank participants with CMR imaging and COVID-19 testing. We considered left and right ventricular (LV, RV) volumes, ejection fractions, and stroke volumes, LV mass, LV strain, native T1, aortic distensibility, and arterial stiffness index. COVID-19 test results were obtained from Public Health England. Co-morbidities were ascertained from self-report and hospital episode statistics (HES). Critical care admission and death were from HES and death register records. We investigated the association of each cardiovascular measure with COVID-19 test result in multivariable logistic regression models adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, deprivation, body mass index, smoking, diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol, and prior myocardial infarction. RESULTS: We studied 310 participants (n = 70 positive). Median age was 63.8 [57.5, 72.1] years; 51.0% (n = 158) were male. 78.7% (n = 244) were tested in hospital, 3.5% (n = 11) required critical care admission, and 6.1% (n = 19) died. In fully adjusted models, smaller LV/RV end-diastolic volumes, smaller LV stroke volume, and poorer global longitudinal strain were associated with significantly higher odds of COVID-19 positivity. DISCUSSION: We demonstrate association of pre-existing adverse CMR phenotypes with greater odds of COVID-19 positivity independent of classical cardiovascular risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: Observational reports of cardiovascular involvement after COVID-19 may, at least partly, reflect pre-existing cardiac status rather than COVID-19 induced alterations.","Raisi-Estabragh, Zahra; McCracken, Celeste; Cooper, Jackie; Fung, Kenneth; Paiva, José M; Khanji, Mohammed Y; Rauseo, Elisa; Biasiolli, Luca; Raman, Betty; Piechnik, Stefan K; Neubauer, Stefan; Munroe, Patricia B; Harvey, Nicholas C; Petersen, Steffen E",Aging Clin Exp Res,283,16

Serological tests can assess the extent of exposure and herd immunity to COVID-19 in general populations. This study aimed to estimate the nationwide seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies according to age, sex and clinical status in South Korea. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study randomly selected health examinees who underwent health check-up at 16 health promotion centres in 13 Korean cities across the country between late September and early December 2020. Residual serum samples were obtained from 4085 subjects (2014 men and 2071 women). Antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were measured by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay using Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 (Roche Elecsys, Mannheim, Germany). PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Fisher's exact test was used to compare the seroprevalence according to sex, age group and region. The relative risks of being seropositive according to the characteristics of the study subjects were analysed using logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: The overall seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 was 0.39% (95% CI=0.20% to 0.58%): 0.30% (95% CI=0.06% to 0.54%) for men and 0.48% (95% CI=0.18% to 0.78%) for women. The rate of anti-SARS-CoV-2 positivity varied significantly between different regions of Korea (p=0.003), but not with age group, sex, or the statuses of obesity, diabetes, hypertension or smoking. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the Korean population is still immunologically vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2, but the seroprevalence has increased relative to that found in studies performed prior to September 2020 in Korea.","Nah, Eun-Hee; Cho, Seon; Park, Hyeran; Hwang, Inhwan; Cho, Han-Ik",BMJ Open,283,23

Humoral vaccination response is impaired in these patients when circulating B cells are lacking. We aimed to analyze B-cell subsets at the time of vaccination to identify potential predictors of humoral vaccination response. MethodsPatients (n=120) receiving B-cell-depleting therapy (n=41), those suffering from inborn errors of immunity (n=25) and hematologic malignancies (n=56), and healthy controls (n=79) were vaccinated twice with BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273. B-cell subsets were analyzed prior to vaccination. Two independent anti-SARS-CoV-2 S immunoassays targeting the receptor-binding domain (RBD) or trimeric S protein (TSP) were performed three to four weeks after the second vaccination. ResultsSeroconversion occurred in 100% of the healthy controls, in contrast to 67% (RBD) and 82% (TSP) of the patients, while only 32% (RBD) and 22% (TSP) achieved antibody levels comparable to those of healthy controls. The number of circulating naive B cell was strongly associated with antibody levels (r=0.761, P<0.001) across all immunosuppressive treatments or conditions. In multivariable analysis, the number of naive B cells was an independent predictor for achieving antibody levels comparable to healthy controls, and receiver operating characteristic analysis predicted that at least six naive B cells per {micro}L were required. ConclusionsAssessing the abundance of naive B cells in immunocompromised patients could be useful in predicting the optimal vaccination response.

Apart from clinical severity of patients, a need for robust predictors was also felt for early categorization and accurate prediction of final fatal outcome in hospitalized patients. Material and Method: In this retrospective observational cohort study all the adult patients admitted during November month were included. Available data for epidemiological factors, inflammatory biomarkers and CT severity score were collected and analyzed by univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis to know predictive ability of each variable. A Receiver operating characteristic analysis was done to compare the predictive ability of each factor for final outcome of death. Results: We analyzed records of 735 total patients. Most of them were male (72.38%), have a median (IQR) age of 60 years (50-69). Diabetes (42.85%), and hypertension (39.86%) were the most common co-morbidities. After univariate and multivariate regression analysis we could find that CRP, D-Dimer and CT severity score levels only can predict final outcome of death. During multivariate regression and receiver operative characteristic (ROC) analysis also, age and Charlson's co-morbidity index failed to predict in hospital mortality. CRP and D-Dimer on admission positively predicts final outcome of in hospital mortality with AUROC of 0.749(p=0.007, CI 0.61-0.88), and 0.864(p= 0.000, CI 0.74-0.99) respectively. Whereas, CT severity score had AUROC 0.73 (p= 0.014, CI 0.575-0.83). Cut off for CRP was 45 mg/L (Sn 0.8, Sp 0.56), D-dimer was 1000 μg/L (Sn:0.8, Sp: 0.9), and CT severity score was 15 (Sn 0.8, Sp 0.58). Conclusion: CRP level of 45 mg/l, D-dimer level of 1000 μg/L and CT severity level of >15 at the time of admission can be added to conventional clinical severity algorithm to more accurately predicting final outcome and stratifying the level of care offered at the time of admission, and hence may improve odds off survival. © 2021 Journal of Association of Physicians of India.

Age and underlying comorbidities are important factors that play a significant role in COVID-19 severity. The uppermost number of the patients had symptoms of fever 78.3%, cough 50.4% and myalgias 50.1% RT-PCR low Ct value could be an important indicator related with the disease severity and mortality risk p value < 0.001 and 0.003 respectively. Bilirubin indirect, ALT, AST, and CRP were significantly associated with disease severity. Deritis ratio and CRP was found to be significantly associated with the risk of mortality. CONCLUSIONSReal-Time PCR results along with Ct values for SARS-CoV-2 may have benefit for clinicians in patient management decisions. Several risk factors e.g., age and comorbidities for developing severe disease and mortality risk have been identified. These biochemical laboratory parameters ALT, AST, Deritis ratio and CRP can be used as predictive biomarkers for progression towards severe disease and risk of mortality.","Khurshid, Fatima; Iqbal, Sajad; Mumtaz, Madiha",,283,16

METHODS: Case numbers from calendar weeks 1 through 22 of the two consecutive years 2019 and 2020 were obtained from 29 university hospitals and 7 non-university hospitals in Germany. Information was also obtained on the patients' age, sex, and urgency, along with the type of case (outpatient/inpatient), admitting ward, and a small number of tracer diagnoses (I21, myocardial infarction; J44, COPD; and I61, I63, I64, G45, stroke /TIA), as well as on the number of COVID-19 cases and of tests performed for SARS-CoV-2, as a measure of the number of cases in which COVID-19 was suspected or at least included in the differential diagnoses. RESULTS: A total of 1 022 007 emergency room consultations were analyzed, of which 546 940 took place in 2019 and 475 067 in 2020. The number of consultations with a positive test for the COVID-19 pathogen was 3122. The total number of emergency room consultations in the observation period was 13% lower in 2020 than in 2019, with a maximum drop by 38% coinciding with the highest number of COVID-19 cases (calendar week 14; 572 cases). After the initiation of interpersonal contact restrictions in 2020, there was a marked drop in COVID-19 case numbers, by a mean of -240 cases per week per emergency room (95% confidence interval [-284; -128]). There was a rise in case numbers thereafter, by a mean of 17 patients per week [14; 19], and the number of cases of myocardial infarction returned fully to the level seen in 2019. CONCLUSION: In Germany, the COVID-19 pandemic led to a significant drop in medical emergencies of all kinds presenting to the nation's emergency departments. A recovery effect began to be seen as early as calendar week 15, but the levels seen in 2019 were not yet reached overall by calendar week 22; only the prevalence of myocardial infarction had renormalized by then. The reasons for this require further investigation.","Slagman, Anna; Behringer, Wilhelm; Greiner, Felix; Klein, Matthias; Weismann, Dirk; Erdmann, Bernadett; Pigorsch, Mareen; Möckel, Martin",Dtsch Arztebl Int,283,20

Effects of the PNiPAM loading level in the range of 0-40% by weight ( wt%) on the chemical, mechanical, thermal, and morphological properties of the CMC/PNiPAMx films (where x is the wt% of PNiPAM) were symmetrically investigated. The obtained CMC/PNiPAMx films showed a high compatibility between the polymers. The CMC/PNiPAM20 blend showed the greatest tensile strength and modulus at 37.9 MPa and 2.1 GPa, respectively. Moreover, the thermal degradation of CMC was retarded by the addition of PNiPAM. Scanning electron microscopy images of CMC/PNiPAM20 revealed a porous structure that likely supported Zn2+ movement in the SPEs containing zinc triflate, resulting in the high Zn2+ ion transference number (0.56) and ionic conductivity (1.68 × 10-4 S cm-1). Interestingly, the presence of PNiPAM in the CMC/PNiPAMx blends showed a greater stability during charge-discharge cyclic tests, indicating the ability of PNiPAM to suppress dendrite formation from causing a short circuit. The developed CMC/PNiPAM20 based SPE is a promising material for high ionic conductivity and stability in a Zn ion battery.","Dueramae, Isala; Okhawilai, Manunya; Kasemsiri, Pornnapa; Uyama, Hiroshi; Kita, Rio",Sci Rep,283,15

COVID-19, as a new coronavirus, mainly targets the patient’s lung triggering a cascade of innate and adaptive immune responses in the host. The principal causes of death among COVID-19 patients, especially elderly subjects with cardiovascular diseases, are acute respiratory distress syndrome(ARDS), multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), and microvascular thrombosis. All prompted by an excessive uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response. Immunosenescence, characterized by systemic and chronic inflammation as well as innate/adaptive immune imbalance, presents both in the elderly and cardiovascular patients. COVID-19 infection further aggravates the existing inflammatory process and lymphocyte depletion leading to uncontrollable systemic inflammatory responses, which is the primary cause of death.

The effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on MS are not known. The aim of this study was to understand the impact of COVID-19 on new and pre-existing symptoms of MS. METHODS: The COVID-19 and MS study is an ongoing community-based, prospective cohort study conducted as part of the United Kingdom MS Register. People with MS and COVID-19 were invited by email to complete a questionnaire about their MS symptoms during the infection. An MS exacerbation was defined as developing new MS symptoms and/or worsening of pre-existing MS symptoms. RESULTS: Fifty-seven percent (230/404) of participants had an MS exacerbation during their infection; 82 developed new MS symptoms, 207 experienced worsened pre-existing MS symptoms, and 59 reported both. Disease modifying therapies (DMTs) reduced the likelihood of developing new MS symptoms during the infection (OR 0.556, 95%CI 0.316-0.978). Participants with a higher pre-COVID-19 webEDSS (web-based Expanded Disability Status Scale) score (OR 1.251, 95%CI 1.060-1.478) and longer MS duration (OR 1.042, 95%CI 1.009-1.076) were more likely to experience worsening of their pre-existing MS symptoms during the infection.

Few studies have examined the implications of public transit reliance on riders’ ability to reach healthcare when transit is disrupted. To understand how shocks to transportation systems impact healthcare access, this study measures the impact of avoiding public transit on the ability of riders to access healthcare and pharmacy services during lockdowns. Methods We deployed a cross-sectional survey of residents of Toronto and Vancouver in May 2020 through Facebook advertisements and community list-serves. Eligibility criteria included riding transit at least weekly prior to the pandemic and subsequent cessation of transit use during the pandemic. We applied multivariable modified Poisson models to identify socio-demographic, transportation, health-related, and neighborhood predictors of experiencing increased difficulty accessing healthcare and getting prescriptions while avoiding public transit. We also predicted which respondents reported deferring medical care until they felt comfortable riding transit again. Results A total of 4367 former transit riders were included (64.2% female, 56.1% Toronto residents). Several factors were associated with deferring medical care including: being non-White (Toronto, APR, 1.14;95% CI, 1.00-1.29;Vancouver, APR, 1.52;95% CI, 1.26-1.84), having a physical disability (Toronto, APR, 1.20;95% CI, 1.00-1.45;Vancouver, APR, 1.42;95% CI, 1.08-1.87), having no vehicle access (Toronto, APR, 1.74;95% CI, 1.51-2.00;Vancouver, APR, 2.74;95% CI, 2.20-3.42), and having low income (Toronto, APR, 1.77;95% CI, 1.44-2.17;Vancouver, APR, 1.51;95% CI, 1.06-2.14). Discussion During COVID-19 in two major Canadian cities, former transit riders from marginalized groups were more likely to defer medical care than other former riders. COVID-19 related transit disruptions may have imposed a disproportionate burden on the health access of marginalized individuals. Policymakers should consider prioritizing healthcare access for vulnerable residents during crises.","Palm, Matthew Sturrock Shelby L.; Howell, Nicholas A.; Farber, Steven Widener Michael",Journal of Transport &amp; Health,283,24

Despite limited evidence, an increasing number of surgeons suggest laparoscopic repair as an alternative to the gold standard of open repair. This review critically analysed post-operative clinical outcome on open versus laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair in paediatric patients. Before initiating the study, recurrence was defined as the primary outcome, and secondary outcomes were early post-operative pain, operation time and surgical site infections. METHODS: The PRISMA guidelines were followed. Using strict inclusion and exclusion criteria, the following databases were searched: MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science and Embase (May 2019). Retrospective and uncontrolled studies were excluded. RESULTS: Five studies were identified, four randomised controlled trials (n = 272) and one controlled prospective study (n = 85) which included a total of 357 patients. Generally, the studies included few patients, were highly heterogenic and were overall of moderate quality. With a follow-up time ranging from three months to 14 years, there was no difference in recurrence rate after unilateral open (0-2%) versus unilateral laparoscopic (0-4%) or bilateral open versus bilateral laparoscopic repair (n = 281; p > 0.05 in all studies). There were no other significant differences in any of the outcomes, including post-operative pain (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: There is no solid evidence that clinical outcome is improved after laparoscopic paediatric inguinal hernia repair compared with the gold standard.","Mahmood, Badar; Christoffersen, Mette; Miserez, Marc; Bisgaard, Thue",Danish medical journa,283,16

Therefore, cost-efficient, reliable and sensitive real-time monitoring methods are highly desirable to measure protease activity. In this paper, we describe the development of a new experimental approach for investigation of proteolytic enzymes. The method was designed by the combination of recombinant fusion protein substrates and bio-layer interferometry (BLI). The protease (PR) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) was applied as model enzyme to set up and test the method. The principle of the assay is that the recombinant protein substrates immobilized to the surface of biosensor are specifically cleaved by the PR, and the substrate processing can be followed by measuring change in the layer thickness by optical measurement. We successfully used this method to detect the HIV-1 PR activity in real time, and the initial rate of the signal decrease was found to be proportional to the enzyme activity. Substrates representing wild-type and modified cleavage sites were designed to study HIV-1 PR's specificity, and the BLI-based measurements showed differential cleavage efficiency of the substrates, which was proven by enzyme kinetic measurements. We applied this BLI-based assay to experimentally confirm the existence of extended binding sites at the surface of HIV-1 PR. We found the measurements may be performed using lysates of cells expressing the fusion protein, without primary purification of the substrate. The designed BLI-based protease assay is high-throughput-compatible and enables real-time and small-volume measurements, thus providing a new and versatile approach to study proteolytic enzymes.","Miczi, Márió; Diós, Ádám; Bozóki, Beáta; Tozsér, József; Mótyán, János András",Viruses,283,16

However, more details in the changes, future air quality trends, and related death benefits on a national scale are still unclear. In this study, a total of 352 Chinese cities were included. We collected air pollutants (including fine particulate matter [PM2.5], inhalable particulate matter [PM10], nitrogen dioxide [NO2], and ozone [O3]) data for each city from January 2015 to July 2020. Convolutional neural network-quantile regression (CNN-QR) forecasting model was used to predict pollutants concentrations from February 2020 to January 2021 and the changes in air pollutants were compared. The relationships between the socioeconomic factors and the changes and the avoided mortality due to the changes were further estimated. We found sharp declines in all air pollutants from February 2020 to January 2021. Specifically, PM2.5, PM10, NO2, and O3 would drop by 3.86 μg/m3 (10.81%), 4.84 μg/m3 (7.65%), 0.55 μg/m3 (2.18%), and 3.14 μg/m3 (3.36%), respectively. The air quality changes were significantly related to many of the socioeconomic factors, including the size of built-up area, gross regional product, population density, gross regional product per capita, and secondary industry share. And the improved air quality would avoid a total of 7,237 PM2.5-related deaths (95% confidence intervals [CI]: 4,935 to 9,209), 9,484 PM10-related deaths (95%CI: 5,362 to 13,604), 4,249 NO2-related deaths (95%CI: 3,305 to 5,193), and 6,424 O3-related deaths (95%CI: 3,480 to 9,367), respectively. Our study shows that the interventions to control COVID-19 would improve air quality, which had significant relationships with some socioeconomic factors.

It causes fever, cough, myalgia, fatigue up to dyspnoea, responsible for hospitalization and artificial oxygenation. SARS-CoV-2 infects human cells using ACE2, the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro ). Once bound to ACE2 and the other two proteases in concert they allow the virus replication and spread throughout the body. Our attention has been focused on the role of ACE2 as its binding to by the virus increases bradykinin and its metabolites, which facilitate inflammation in the lung (causing cough and fever), coagulation and the complement system. These three systems are involved in angioedema, cardiovascular dysfunction and sepsis, pathologies which occur in COVID-19 patients. Thus, we propose that blocking the kallikrein-kinin system with lanadelumab, approved for hereditary angioedema, will prevent facilitation of these 3 systems.

Turkey is the country hosting the largest number of refugees in the world with 3.6 million Syrian refugees 46 % of which are under 18 years old. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this article is to conduct a narrative review and analyze the vulnerabilities of refugee children in Turkey from the lens of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), more specifically SDG Goal 3: Good Health and Wellbeing, with a specific focus on Syrian refugee children. Moreover, this article explores the actions taken to prevent and mitigate issues that arise from these vulnerabilities. METHOD: This narrative review article collected data from various primary and secondary sources on the Turkish refugee framework including national and international legislation, governmental and non-governmental data and reports, and scientific papers. RESULTS: Syrian refugee children in Turkey are facing a variety of risks in terms of their health and wellbeing including communicable and non-communicable diseases, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, family violence, child labor, and child marriage. The measures taken for prevention and response by governmental and non-governmental entities are multilateral and aim to address issues from multiple perspectives including medical, psychosocial, child protection, and legal. CONCLUSIONS: The interventions and restructuring of the health system in Turkey contribute to the SDG number 3 for refugee children. The existence of a legal system which enables refugee access to health, protection, and other social services is key to achieve this goal. However, the existing system could be improved especially through solidifying the legal basis and centralizing the implementation for child and refugee protection. The engagement of all stakeholders to improve the health and wellbeing of refugee children remains vital.","Sahin, Ecem; Dagli, Tolga E; Acarturk, Ceren; Sahin Dagli, Figen",Child Abuse Negl,283,1

METHODS: The study population included patients who underwent head and neck surgery at an academic tertiary care center between February 2020 and November 2020 and were discharged with one to four drains with instructions for home removal. Prior to discharge, patients received thorough drain removal education. Patients were prospectively followed to evaluate for associated outcomes. RESULTS: One hundred patients were evaluated in the study. There was record for ninety-seven patients receiving education at discharge. The most common methods of education were face-to-face education and written instructions with educational video link provided. Of 123 drains upon discharge, 110 drains (89.4%) were removed at home while 13 (10.6%) were removed in office. Most drains were located in the neck (86.4%). There was one seroma, two hematomas, two drain site infections, and five ED visits; however, none of these complications were directly associated with the action of drain removal at home. Calculated cost savings for travel and lost wages was $259.82 per round trip saved. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate that home drain removal can provide a safe and efficacious option for patients following head and neck surgery. This approach was safe and associated with patient cost savings and better utilization of provider's time. Furthermore, patients and healthcare providers avoided additional in-person encounters and exposures during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings warrant further investigation into cost savings and formal patient satisfaction associated with home drain removal.

Released cytokines and oxidative stress following acute liver damage may affect other organs' function notably the diaphragm, which is particularly sensitive to oxidative stress and circulating cytokines. We addressed this issue in a mouse model of acute liver injury induced by administration of APAP. C57BL/6J mice (each n = 8) were treated with N-acetyl-para-amino phenol (APAP) to induce acute drug caused liver injury and sacrificed 12 or 24 h afterwards. An untreated group served as controls. Key markers of inflammation, proteolysis, autophagy and oxidative stress were measured in diaphragm samples. In APAP treated animals, liver damage was proven by the enhanced serum levels of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase. In the diaphragm, besides a significant increase in IL 6 and lipid peroxidation, no changes were observed in key markers of the proteolytic, and autophagy signaling pathways, other inflammatory markers and fiber dimensions. The first 24 h of acute liver damage did not impair diaphragm atrophic pathways although it slightly enhanced IL-6 and lipid peroxidation. Whether longer exposure might affect the diaphragm needs to be addressed in future experiments.","Bruells, C S; Duschner, P; Marx, G; Gayan-Ramirez, G; Frank, N; Breuer, T; Krenkel, O; Tacke, F; Mossanen, J C",Sci Rep,283,24

DATA SOURCES: A literature search of MEDLINE, PubMed and clinicaltrials.gov was performed to identify studies between 1980 to 2020 using the following search terms: corticosteroids, COVID19, severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and influenza. Pre-printed articles were also reviewed at medRxiv.org. DATA ANALYSIS: Corticosteroids were not recommended early in the COVID-19 pandemic outside of the use for concomitant indications (i.e. ARDS, septic shock) as they have been associated with delayed time to viral clearance in other viral pneumonias. A randomized trial showed a mortality benefit with dexamethasone in COVID-19. Guidelines have been updated to include a strong recommendation for their use in COVID-19 in those hospitalized requiring supplemental oxygen or mechanical ventilation. CONCLUSION: Based on data from available randomized trials, patients that require respiratory support or mechanical ventilation benefit from corticosteroid therapy. Corticosteroids are an inexpensive and readily available therapy that should be standard of care in hospitalized COVID-19 patients requiring respiratory support.","Johns, Meagan; George, Stephy; Taburyanskaya, Margarita; Poon, Yi Kee",J Pharm Pract,283,5

METHODS: This is an observational cross-sectional study through an online questionnaire survey. A self-administered survey (PEF-COVID19) was applied in the Brazilian general population, age &#8805; 18 years. T-test for independent samples and Chi-square tests were used to compare Brazil and different macro-regions, pË0.05. RESULTS: 1,977 participants filled the survey and 1,845 were included; 80% of the included ones were in social isolation. In general, the self-related physical exercise practice before and during the COVID-19 pandemic and exercise characteristics were highly affected by the pandemic (pË0.05). Sedentary behavior increased significantly (14.9 vs. 29.8%) and between the active ones, the frequency of PEx per week and duration of the PEx practice decreased significantly. The motivation to exercise also changed considering performance and health before and during the pandemic, respectively (10 vs. 5.6% and 72.4 vs. 79.1%). Also, the sample started to exercise less in the night and more in the afternoon, respectively (33.7 vs. 25.3% and 19.1 vs. 31.5%). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic highly influenced the physical exercise practice and habits (frequency, duration, motivation, period to exercise) in Brazil and its main macro-regions. These results can be used to create measures, as home-based exercise programs, to avoid the harm of sedentary behaviors and mental health impact during and after the pandemic.","Sonza, Anelise; Da Cunha de Sá-Caputo, Danubia; Bachur, José Alexandre; Rodrigues de Araújo, Maria das Graças; Valadares Trippo, Karen Valadares Trippo; Ribeiro Nogueira da Gama, Dirceu Ribeiro Nogueira da Gama; Lago Borges, Daniel; Amaral Mendonça, Vanessa; Bernardo-Filho, Mario",Acta Biomed,283,1

METHODS: Applicants signed a confidentiality agreement prior to their interviews and were invited to watch a series of videos orienting them to the process and to the program itself. All faculty raters interviewed candidates using a total of 6 non-medical MMI scenarios with corresponding questions and scoring rubrics through the Zoom platform. Applicants were then welcomed to voluntary informal conversations with the current fellow trainees and faculty. An optional survey was sent to the applicants post-interview to assess their overall satisfaction with the virtual process. RESULTS: The survey analyzed the following using a 5 point Likert scale: Overall Satisfaction, Video Overview Program, Interview Day Details, Video Tour, Web-Based Interviews, Process was Fair, and finally a question on Informed Decision regarding receiving sufficient information to formulate their rank list. All respondents (80% response rate) reported being either satisfied or very satisfied with each of the aspects of the interview process detailed above.

In particular, since from the beginning of the pandemic it has been clear that people from Black and African American backgrounds seem to be hit especially hard by the virus, creating a substantial infection gap. The observed abnormal impact on these ethnic groups could probably be due to the co-occurrence of other known risk factors, including co-morbidity, poverty, level of education, access to healthcare, residential segregation and response to cures, although those factors do not seem able to explain fully and in depth the excess incidence of infections and deaths among African Americans. Here, we introduce the concept of diffusion segregation, that is the extent to which a given group of people is internally clustered or exposed to other groups, as a result of mobility and commuting habits. By analysing census and mobility data on major US cities, we found that the weekly excess COVID-19 incidence and mortality in African American communities at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic is significantly associated with their level of diffusion segregation. The results confirm that knowing where people commute to, rather than where they live, is potentially much more important to contain and curb the spreading of infectious diseases.","Bassolas, Aleix; Sousa, Sandro; Nicosia, Vincenzo",J R Soc Interface,283,20

Evidence shows that these psychological challenges are especially prominent in healthcare workers (HCW); especially in nurses. Indeed, several studies report that nurses suffer more psychologically because of the consequences of the pandemic compared with medical doctors. To further look into this, we systematically review the recent literature to see whether the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic differs between medical doctors and nurses across studies and which aspects of mental health are especially affected in nurses. RECENT FINDINGS: Across studies, there is solid evidence that nurses show poorer mental health outcomes compared with medical doctors during the COVID-19 pandemic. This is especially true for symptoms of depression, anxiety and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Here, prevalence rates in nurses are often higher than 50%. In contrast, general stress levels and burnout seem to be comparable between nurses and medical doctors.

RESULT: A total of 3 trials including 245 COVID-19 patients were eventually enrolled.Compared with the control group,the LQ group showed great significant difference on reducing the rate of clinical change to severe or critical condition[RRâ¯=â¯0.38, 95 %CI (0.17,0.85), Pâ¯<â¯0.05]and the fever time (SMD =-0.57,95 %CI (-0.96,-0.17), P<0.05),as well as the significant improvement on the disappearance rate of the clinical symptoms: fever [RRâ¯=â¯1.36,95 %CI (1.14,1.61), Pâ¯<â¯0.05],cough[RRâ¯=â¯1.99,95 %CI (1.39,2.86), Pâ¯<â¯0.05],fatigue[RRâ¯=â¯1.52,95 %CI (1.15,2.01), Pâ¯<â¯0.05] and anhelation [RRâ¯=â¯4.18,95 %CI (1.99,8.81), Pâ¯<â¯0.05], but no significance on expectoration[RRâ¯=â¯2.46,95 %CI (0.81,7.51), Pâ¯<â¯0.05]. CONCLUSION: The clinical application of LQ on the treatment of COVID-19 has significant efficacy in improving clinical symptoms and reducing the rate of clinical change to severe or critical condition. Nevertheless, due to the limited quantity and quality of the included studies, more and higher quality trials with more observational indicators are expected to be published.","Zhuang, Jieqin; Dai, Xingzhen; Wu, Qihua; Cai, Hairong; Fu, Xue; Zhang, Weizhang; Chen, Bojun",Complement Ther Med,283,16

Critically, successful adaptation helps to reduce such symptoms to baseline, preventing long-term psychiatric disorders. It is thus important to understand whether and which psychiatric symptoms show transient elevations, and which persist long-term and become chronically heightened. At particular risk for the latter trajectory are symptom dimensions directly affected by the pandemic, such as obsessive-compulsive (OC) symptoms. In this longitudinal large-scale study (N = 406), we assessed how OC, anxiety and depression symptoms changed throughout the first pandemic wave in a sample of the general UK public. We further examined how these symptoms affected pandemic-related information seeking and adherence to governmental guidelines. We show that scores in all psychiatric domains were initially elevated, but showed distinct longitudinal change patterns. Depression scores decreased, and anxiety plateaued during the first pandemic wave, while OC symptoms further increased, even after the ease of Covid-19 restrictions. These OC symptoms were directly linked to Covid-related information seeking, which gave rise to higher adherence to government guidelines. This increase of OC symptoms in this non-clinical sample shows that the domain is disproportionately affected by the pandemic. We discuss the long-term impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on public mental health, which calls for continued close observation of symptom development.","Loosen, Alisa M; Skvortsova, Vasilisa; Hauser, Tobias U",Transl Psychiatry,283,8

Almost all of these vaccines have been designed to induce antibodies targeting spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 in expectation of neutralizing activities. However, non-neutralizing antibodies are at risk of causing antibody-dependent enhancement. Further, the longevity of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies is very short. Therefore, in addition to antibody-induced vaccines, novel vaccines on the basis of SARS-CoV-2-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) should be considered in the vaccine development. Here, we attempted to identify HLA-A*02:01-restricted CTL epitopes derived from the non-structural polyprotein 1a of SARS-CoV-2. Eighty-two peptides were firstly predicted as epitope candidates on bioinformatics. Fifty-four in 82 peptides showed high or medium binding affinities to HLA-A*02:01. HLA-A*02:01 transgenic mice were then immunized with each of the 54 peptides encapsulated into liposomes. The intracellular cytokine staining assay revealed that 18 out of 54 peptides were CTL epitopes because of the induction of IFN-Î³-producing CD8+ T cells. In the 18 peptides, 10 peptides were chosen for the following analyses because of their high responses. To identify dominant CTL epitopes, mice were immunized with liposomes containing the mixture of the 10 peptides. Some peptides were shown to be statistically predominant over the other peptides. Surprisingly, all mice immunized with the liposomal 10 peptide mixture did not show the same reaction pattern to the 10 peptides. There were three response patterns, suggesting the existence of an immunodominance hierarchy following peptide vaccination, which may provide us more variations in the epitope selection for designing CTL-based COVID-19 vaccines.IMPORTANCE For the development of vaccines based on SARS-CoV-2-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), we attempted to identify HLA-A*02:01-restricted CTL epitopes derived from the non-structural polyprotein 1a of SARS-CoV-2.

We aimed to present early data on children tested for SARS-CoV-2 at a large Australian tertiary children's hospital according to the state health department guidelines, which varied over time. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study at The Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, Australia. It included all paediatric patients (aged 0-18 years) who presented to the ED or the Respiratory Infection Clinic (RIC) and were tested for SARS-CoV-2. The 30-day study period commenced after the first confirmed positive case was detected at the hospital on 21 March 2020, until 19 April 2020. We recorded epidemiological and clinical data. RESULTS: There were 433 patients in whom SARS-CoV-2 testing was performed in ED (331 [76%]) or RIC (102 [24%]). There were four (0.9%) who had positive SARS-CoV-2 detected, none of whom were admitted to hospital or developed severe disease.

In this context, reliable and interpretable forecasts of disease incidents are a vital tool for policymakers to manage healthcare resources. Several experts have called for the necessity to account for human mobility to explain the spread of COVID-19. Existing approaches are often applying standard models of the respective research field. This habit, however, often comes along with certain restrictions. For instance, most statistical or epidemiological models cannot directly incorporate unstructured data sources, including relational data that may encode human mobility. In contrast, machine learning approaches may yield better predictions by exploiting these data structures, yet lack intuitive interpretability as they are often categorized as black-box models. We propose a trade-off between both research directions and present a multimodal learning approach that combines the advantages of statistical regression and machine learning models for predicting local COVID-19 cases in Germany. This novel approach enables the use of a richer collection of data types, including mobility flows and colocation probabilities, and yields the lowest MSE scores throughout our observational period in our benchmark study. The results corroborate the necessity of including mobility data and showcase the flexibility and interpretability of our approach.","Fritz, Cornelius; Dorigatti, Emilio; Rugamer, David",,283,10

PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to establish a drive-through clinic model to provide glaucoma care for patients while minimizing the risk of COVID-19 transmission. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A drive-through clinic was created by adapting a 1-lane, 1-way driveway adjacent to the Kellogg Eye Center building entrance. Patients were physicianselected from the Glaucoma Clinic at Kellogg Eye Center as existing patients who required intraocular pressure (IOP) checks and therapeutic management and were chosen based on their ability to be managed with an IOP measurement primarily. The entrance was otherwise closed to the public, allowing staff to utilize an adjacent vestibule with glass walls and sliding doors as a staffroom. Patients were instructed to arrive within a 15-minute time window at which time they would drive through the lane and stop their cars under an awning over the driveway. Ophthalmic technicians wearing appropriate personal protective equipment then approached each car, confirmed patient information, and measured IOP. Once the data were recorded using a mobile workstation, the physician was able to complete each visit by discussing the findings and therapeutic plan with the patient, either in-person in real time or virtually by phone or video visit at a later time.

In this context, and as a response to the economic difficulties resulted from the global economic crisis imposed by the Covid-19, the aim of this paper is to show theoretically and empirically that an expansive fiscal policy, focused on increasing public investment, could reduce, or at least control, the public debt accumulation as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product (GDP).","González, Josué Zavaleta",Investigacion Economica,283,26

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is one of the main tests used to detect COVID-19 infection. However, it is expensive, time-consuming, and lacks sufficient accuracy. In recent years, convolutional neural networks have grabbed many researchers' attention in the machine learning field, due to its high diagnosis accuracy, especially the medical image recognition. Many architectures such as Inception, ResNet, DenseNet, and VGG16 have been proposed and gained an excellent performance at a low computational cost. Moreover, in a way to accelerate the training of these traditional architectures, residual connections are combined with inception architecture. Therefore, many hybrid architectures such as Inception-ResNetV2 are further introduced. This paper proposes an enhanced Inception-ResNetV2 deep learning model that can diagnose chest X-ray (CXR) scans with high accuracy. Besides, a Grad-CAM algorithm is used to enhance the visualization of the infected regions of the lungs in CXR images.

However, there is no consensus on which factors contribute more to predicting psychological health. OBJECTIVES: The present study quantifies the importance of related risk factors on the level of psychological distress and further explores the threshold effect of each rick factor on the level of psychological distress. Both subjective and objective measures of risk factors are considered in the model. METHODS: We sampled 937 individual items of data obtained from an online questionnaire between 20 January and 13 February 2020 in China. Objective risk factors were measured in terms of direct distance from respondents' housing to the nearest COVID-19 hospital, direct distance from respondents' housing to the nearest park, and the air quality index (AQI). Perceived risk factors were measured in regard to perceived distance to the nearest COVID-19 hospital, perceived air quality, and perceived environmental quality. Psychological distress was measured with the Kessler psychological distress scale K6 score. The following health risk factors and sociodemographic factors were considered: self-rated health level, physical health status, physical activity, current smoker or drinker, age, gender, marital status, educational attainment level, residence location, and household income level. A gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) was used to analyse the data. RESULTS: Health risk factors were the greatest contributors to predicting the level of psychological distress, with a relative importance of 42.32% among all influential factors. Objective risk factors had a stronger predictive power than perceived risk factors (23.49% vs. 16.26%). Furthermore, it was found that there was a dramatic rise in the moderate level of psychological distress regarding the threshold of AQI between 40 and 50, and 110 and 130, respectively. Gender-sensitive analysis revealed that women and men responded differently to psychological distress based on different risk factors. CONCLUSION: We found evidence that perceived indoor air quality played a more important role in predicting psychological distress compared to ambient air pollution during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Chen, Yiyi; Liu, Ye",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),283,22

There are still not enough individuals being analyzed with MRI for age estimation. The aim of this study was to investigate the utility of T1-weighted turbo spin echo (T1-TSE) MRI sequences in determining the degree of ossification of the distal femoral and proximal tibial epiphyses in a Turkish population. In this study, images from 649 patients (335 males and 314 females) aged 10-30 years were retrospectively evaluated with sagittal T1-weighted turbo spin echo (T1-TSE) MRI sequences of the knee. Proximal tibial and distal femoral epiphysis were scored by two different observers twice using the combined staging system described by Schmeling and Kellinghaus. Spearman's rank correlation analysis indicated a significant positive relationship between age and ossification stages of the distal femoral and proximal tibial epiphyses (p < 0.001). The intra- and inter-observer reliabilities in evaluating the femur and tibia were separately determined and gave promising results and Cohen's kappa statistics ranged from &#954; = 0.886 and &#954; = 0.961. The minimal ages of patients with stage 4 ossification were 15.1 years for females and 15.8 years for males for the distal tibial epiphysis and 15.4 years for females and 17 years for males for the distal femoral epiphysis. This study show that (T1-TSE) MRI and the applicability and Schmeling and Kellinghaus staging method of the knee can be performed for living 14- to 17-year-old individuals in need of a supportive noninvasive method for estimating forensic age.","Ekizoglu, Oguzhan; Er, Ali; Bozdag, Mustafa; Basa, Can Doruk; Kacmaz, Ismail Eralp; Moghaddam, Negahnaz; Grabherr, Silke",Int. j. legal med,283,10

Human phage display technology has revolutionized the process of identifying and optimizing antibodies, providing facile entry points for further applications. Herein, we use this technology to search for antibodies targeting the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of CoV-2. Specifically, we screened a naïve human semisynthetic phage library against RBD, leading to the identification of a high-affinity single-chain fragment variable region (scFv). The scFv was further engineered into two other antibody formats (scFv-Fc and IgG1). All three antibody formats showed high binding specificity to CoV-2 RBD and the spike antigens in different assay systems. Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated specific binding of the IgG1 format to cells expressing membrane-bound CoV-2 spike protein. Docking studies revealed that the scFv recognizes an epitope that partially overlaps with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-interacting sites on the CoV-2 RBD. Given its high specificity and affinity, we anticipate that these anti-CoV-2 antibodies will be useful as valuable reagents for accessing the antigenicity of vaccine candidates, as well as developing antibody-based therapeutics and diagnostics for CoV-2.","Parray, Hilal Ahmad; Chiranjivi, Adarsh Kumar; Asthana, Shailendra; Yadav, Naveen; Shrivastava, Tripti; Mani, Shailendra; Sharma, Chandresh; Vishwakarma, Preeti; Das, Supratik; Pindari, Kamal; Sinha, Subrata; Samal, Sweety; Ahmed, Shubbir; Kumar, Rajesh",J Biol Chem,283,16

Participants were 541 individuals from family members of patients with COVID-19 (F = 52.3%, mean age = 41.3 ± 13.2 years). Data were collected with a packet including sociodemographic and risk factors, the Fear of COVID-19 Scale, the Short Health Anxiety Inventory, the Metacognitions Questionnaire 30, the Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale-12 and the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire. Structural equation modelling analyses revealed a full mediation of metacognitions (i.e., positive beliefs about worry, negative beliefs about thoughts concerning uncontrollability and danger, cognitive confidence and beliefs about the need to control thoughts), intolerance of uncertainty and expressive suppression in the relation between FC-19 and health anxiety. Moreover, the strongest indirect links were found between FC-19 and health anxiety through negative beliefs about thoughts concerning uncontrollability and danger and intolerance of uncertainty. These associations were independent of gender and risk status. The final model accounted for 71% of the variance of health anxiety. These findings suggest that particularly metacognitions, intolerance of uncertainty and expressive suppression play a full mediational role in the relation between FC-19 and health anxiety.","Akbari, Mehdi; Spada, Marcantonio M; Nikcevic, Ana V; Zamani, Elahe",Clin. psychol. psychother,283,26

This study aimed to examine the attitudes and beliefs of Australian adults towards the COVID-19 pandemic, and willingness and capacity to engage with these mitigation measures. In addition, we aimed to explore the psychosocial and demographic factors that are associated with adoption of recommended hygiene-related and avoidance-related behaviors. METHODS: A national cross-sectional online survey of 1420 Australian adults (18 years and older) was undertaken between the 18 and 24 March 2020. The statistical analysis of the data included univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. FINDINGS: The survey of 1420 respondents found 50% (710) of respondents felt COVID-19 would 'somewhat' affect their health if infected and 19% perceived their level of risk as high or very high. 84·9% had performed &#8805;1 of the three recommended hygiene-related behaviors and 93·4% performed &#8805;1 of six avoidance-related behaviors over the last one month. Adopting avoidance behaviors was associated with trust in government/authorities (aOR: 6.0, 95% CI 2.6-11·0), higher perceived rating of effectiveness of behaviors (aOR: 4·0, 95% CI: 1·8-8·7), higher levels of perceived ability to adopt social distancing strategies (aOR: 5.0, 95% CI: 1·5-9.3), higher trust in government (aOR: 6.0, 95% CI: 2.6-11.0) and higher level of concern if self-isolated (aOR: 1.8, 95% CI: 1.1-3.0). INTERPRETATION: In the last two months, members of the public have been inundated with messages about hygiene and social (physical) distancing. However, our results indicate that a continued focus on supporting community understanding of the rationale for these strategies, as well as instilling community confidence in their ability to adopt or sustain the recommendations is needed.","Seale, Holly; Heywood, Anita E; Leask, Julie; Sheel, Meru; Thomas, Susan; Durrheim, David N; Bolsewicz, Katarzyna; Kaur, Rajneesh",PLoS One,283,16

WHO states that there is currently no evidence that people who have recovered from COVID-19 and have antibodies are immune from a second infection [WHO]. Conventional mathematical models consider cases for which a recovered individual either becomes susceptible again or develops an immunity. Here, we study the case where infected agents recover and only develop immunity if they are continuously infected for some time. Otherwise, they become susceptible again. We show that field theory bounds the peak of the infectious rate. Consequently, the theory's phases characterise the disease dynamics: (i) a pandemic phase and (ii) a response regime. The model excellently describes the epidemic spread of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in the city of Wuhan, China. We find that only 30% of the recovered agents have developed an immunity.

Applications to internet traffic and COVID-19 data,15.352715,2.2845871,2020,"Despite numerous barriers to transmission, zoonoses are the major cause of emerging infectious diseases in humans. Among these, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and ebolaviruses have killed thousands; the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has killed millions. Zoonoses and human-to-animal cross-species transmission are driven by human actions and have important management, conservation, and public health implications. The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, which presumably originated from an animal reservoir, has killed more than half a million people around the world and cases continue to rise. In March 2020, New York City was a global epicenter for SARS-CoV-2 infections. During this time, four tigers and three lions at the Bronx Zoo, NY, developed mild, abnormal respiratory signs. We detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in respiratory secretions and/or feces from all seven animals, live virus in three, and colocalized viral RNA with cellular damage in one. We produced nine whole SARS-CoV-2 genomes from the animals and keepers and identified different SARS-CoV-2 genotypes in the tigers and lions. Epidemiologic and genomic data indicated human-to-tiger transmission. These were the first confirmed cases of natural SARS-CoV-2 animal infections in the United States and the first in nondomestic species in the world. We highlight disease transmission at a nontraditional interface and provide information that contributes to understanding SARS-CoV-2 transmission across species.IMPORTANCE The human-animal-environment interface of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an important aspect of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic that requires robust One Health-based investigations. Despite this, few reports describe natural infections in animals or directly link them to human infections using genomic data. In the present study, we describe the first cases of natural SARS-CoV-2 infection in tigers and lions in the United States and provide epidemiological and genetic evidence for human-to-animal transmission of the virus. Our data show that tigers and lions were infected with different genotypes of SARS-CoV-2, indicating two independent transmission events to the animals. Importantly, infected animals shed infectious virus in respiratory secretions and feces. A better understanding of the susceptibility of animal species to SARS-CoV-2 may help to elucidate transmission mechanisms and identify potential reservoirs and sources of infection that are important in both animal and human health.","McAloose, Denise; Laverack, Melissa; Wang, Leyi; Killian, Mary Lea; Caserta, Leonardo C; Yuan, Fangfeng; Mitchell, Patrick K; Queen, Krista; Mauldin, Matthew R; Cronk, Brittany D; Bartlett, Susan L; Sykes, John M; Zec, Stephanie; Stokol, Tracy; Ingerman, Karen; Delaney, Martha A; Fredrickson, Richard; Ivancic, Marina; Jenkins-Moore, Melinda; Mozingo, Katie; Franzen, Kerrie; Bergeson, Nichole Hines; Goodman, Laura; Wang, Haibin; Fang, Ying; Olmstead, Colleen; McCann, Colleen; Thomas, Patrick; Goodrich, Erin; Elvinger, François; Smith, David C; Tong, Suxiang; Slavinski, Sally; Calle, Paul P; Terio, Karen; Torchetti, Mia Kim; Diel, Diego G",mBio (Online),283,25

Both questionnaires asked respondents of the effect of COVID-19 on their mental health, and the former asked respondents about the effect of COVID-19 on their patient group's mental health. The questionnaires went on to ask respondents about their attitudes to mental health disclosure in various scenarios, to varying groups of people. The general population group was also asked how they would react if someone else disclosed their mental illness to them.ResultThe questionnaire for the medical professionals gained 62 respondents and the one for the general population had 122 respondents, with responses from multiple nations. Overall, COVID-19 has affected everyone's mental health to a degree, and all groups had reservations about disclosing their mental health issues to others. The medical professionals were especially reluctant to disclose mental illness to their patients, but were more comfortable when it came to disclosing mental illness to colleagues. The general population, however, was much more reluctant to disclose mental health issues to their colleagues. The general population were, on the whole, willing to listen to and help anyone who came to them with mental health concerns. Both groups surveyed showed reluctance toward disclosure to the wider community.ConclusionCOVID-19 appears to significantly affect not only physical health, but mental health as well. There is at least some degree of stigma surrounding the disclosure of mental health issues. While most would be happy to help anyone who came to them with their mental health problems, there seems to be an attitude shift when people must contend with mental health issues of their own.","Sengupta, Brishti Dasgupta Pritha",BJPsych Open,283,27

Aside from using the number of confirmed cases and the fatality to measure the impact caused by COVID-19, few adopted the inflection point (IP) to represent the control capability of COVID-19. How to determine the IP days related to the capability is still unclear. This study aims to (i) build a predictive model based on item response theory (IRT) to determine the IP for countries, and (ii) compare which countries (or continents) are hit most. METHODS: We downloaded COVID-19 outbreak data of the number of confirmed cases in all countries as of October 19, 2020. The IRT-based predictive model was built to determine the pandemic IP for each country. A model building scheme was demonstrated to fit the number of cumulative infected cases. Model parameters were estimated using the Solver add-in tool in Microsoft Excel. The absolute advantage coefficient (AAC) was computed to track the IP at the minimum of incremental points on a given ogive curve. The time-to-event analysis (a.k.a. survival analysis) was performed to compare the difference in IPs among continents using the area under the curve (AUC) and the respective 95% confidence intervals (CIs). An online comparative dashboard was created on Google Maps to present the epidemic prediction for each country. RESULTS: The top 3 countries that were hit severely by COVID-19 were France, Malaysia, and Nepal, with IP days at 263, 262, and 262, respectively. The top 3 continents that were hit most based on IP days were Europe, South America, and North America, with their AUCs and 95% CIs at 0.73 (0.61-0.86), 0.58 (0.31-0.84), and 0.54 (0.44-0.64), respectively. An online time-event result was demonstrated and shown on Google Maps, comparing the IP probabilities across continents. CONCLUSION: An IRT modeling scheme fitting the epidemic data was used to predict the length of IP days. Europe, particularly France, was hit seriously by COVID-19 based on the IP days. The IRT model incorporated with AAC is recommended to determine the pandemic IP.","Lee, Keng-Wei; Chien, Tsair-Wei; Yeh, Yu-Tsen; Chou, Willy; Wang, Hsien-Yi",Medicine (Baltimore),283,20

Using a two-stage transfer learning technique to train a convolutional neural network (CNN), we show that the algorithm is able to classify four classes of disease severity (normal, mild, moderate, and severe) with the average Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.93. In addition, we show that the outputs of different layers of the CNN under dominant filters provide valuable insight about the subtle patterns in the CXRs, which can improve the accuracy in the reading of CXRs by a radiologist. Finally, we show that our approach can be used for studying the disease progression in a single patient and its influencing factors. The results suggest that our technique can form the foundation of a more concrete clinical model to predict the evolution of COVID-19 severity and the efficacy of different treatments for each patient through using CXRs and clinical data in the early stages of the disease. This use of AI to assess the severity and possibly predicting the future stages of the disease early on, will be essential in dealing with the upcoming waves of COVID-19 and optimizing resource allocation and treatment.","Zandehshahvar, Mohammadreza; van Assen, Marly; Maleki, Hossein; Kiarashi, Yashar; De Cecco, Carlo N; Adibi, Ali",Sci Rep,283,20

Being endemic to several infectious diseases, Lebanon might be at increased risk of outbreaks as the utilization of RI services might have deteriorated due to the pandemic and the country's political unrest following the October 2019 uprising. The aim of this study was to assess the changes in the utilization of RI services in both the public and private sectors following the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A self-administered cross-sectional survey was completed electronically, in April 2020, by 345 private pediatricians who are registered in professional associations of physicians in Lebanon and provide immunization services at their clinics. Means of the reported percentages of decrease in the utilization of vaccination services by pediatricians were calculated. As for the public sector, an examination of the monthly differences in the number of administered vaccine doses in addition to their respective percentages of change was performed. Adjustment for the distribution of RI services between the sectors was performed to calculate the national decrease rate. RESULTS: The utilization of vaccination services at the national level decreased by 31%. In the private sector, immunization services provision diminished by 46.9% mainly between February and April 2020. The highest decrease rates were observed for oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) and hepatitis A, followed by measles and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines. The number of vaccine doses administered in the public sector decreased by 20%. The most prominent reductions were detected for the OPV and measles vaccines, and during October 2019 and March 2020. CONCLUSION: The substantial decrease in the utilization of RI as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic requires public health interventions to prevent future outbreaks of VPDs.","Mansour, Ziad; Arab, Jinan; Said, Racha; Rady, Alissar; Hamadeh, Randa; Gerbaka, Bernard; Bizri, Abdul Rahman",PLoS One,283,1

It has been described that volatile OSCs uptake occurs into a moderate extent. Among the bioavailable OSCs present in garlic, 2-vinyl-4H-1,3-dithiin (2VD) is a main component in garlic macerated oil and stir-fried garlic but has been poorly investigated compared with others OSCs, such allyl mercaptan (AM) and S-allyl cysteine (SAC). The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of 2VD on vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) isolated from spontaneous hypertensive rats (SHR) and compare them with those produced by AM and SAC. Cell viability and proliferation were measured using tetrazolium dye MTT assay and flow cytometry. Cell migration was evaluated by scrape-wound migration assay. OSCs anti-oxidative capacity was determined by measuring reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and total antioxidant status (TAS). Non-toxic plasmatic concentrations (10 µg L-1) of 2VD and AM inhibited VSMCs proliferation stimulated with 5% fetal bovine serum and impaired cell migration. In further flow cytometry analysis 2VD treatment resulted in a partial cell cycle arrest at G2 phase. The OSCs tested were able to prevent ROS increase after angiotensin II stimulation and surprisingly 2VD induced higher total antioxidant status compared with AM and SAC. Our results showed that 2VD produces equivalent or superior beneficial effects on VSMCs to those reported for other bioavailable compounds of garlic. This preliminary evidence suggests that 2VD intake could also exert important protective effects against arterial remodeling in hypertension.","Torres-Palazzolo, Carolina; de Paola, Matilde; Quesada, Isabel; Camargo, Alejandra; Castro, Claudia",Plant foods hum. nutr,283,2

DESIGN: Using social media for recruitment, we partnered with a local community task force to administer a brief online survey. SETTING: Residential urban community. SAMPLE: Eighty-four community members, the majority of whom were white, female, college educated completed the survey. MEASURES: Theory of planned behavior constructs: behavioral intentions, attitudes, perceived norms, and perceived behavioral control for 3 social distancing behaviors: maintaining a 6-foot distance, avoiding places people congregate, and staying home as much as possible. ANALYSIS: Path analyses were conducted to understand significant determinants of intentions for each behavior to guide the development of locally tailored health promotion messages. RESULTS: The RCBD was implemented, and results were communicated to the community within 1 week. Intentions were high across the 3 behaviors but lowest for staying home as much as possible. Younger participants had lower intentions of maintaining a 6-foot distance than older participants. For each behavior, specific recommendations for health promotion messaging emerged based on how attitudes, norms, and perceived behavioral control related to intentions. CONCLUSION: In a situation where local community action is paramount for reducing coronavirus transmission, this RCBD process is feasible and useful for informing local health promotion.","Smith, Philip H; Branscum, Paul W",Am J Health Promot,283,1

Additionally, the decision on the molecular testing algorithm is hindered by their clinical heterogeneity. However, the precise identification of the type of defect is often a prerequisite for the clinical management and genetic counselling. Four major molecular alterations (epimutations, uniparental disomies, copy number variants, single nucleotide variants) have been identified, but their frequencies vary between SRS and BWS. Due to their molecular aetiology, epimutations in both disorders as well as upd(11)pat in BWS are particular prone to mosaicism which might additionally complicate the interpretation of testing results. We report on our experience of molecular analysis in a total cohort of 1448 patients referred for diagnostic testing of BWS and SRS, comprising a dataset from 737 new patients and from 711 cases from a recent study. Though the majority of positively tested patients showed the expected molecular results, we identified a considerable number of clinically unexpected molecular alterations as well as not yet reported changes and discrepant mosaic distributions. Additionally, the rate of multilocus imprinting disturbances among the patients with epimutations and uniparental diploidies could be further specified. Altogether, these cases show that comprehensive testing strategies have to be applied in diagnostic testing of SRS and BWS. The precise molecular diagnosis is required as the basis for a targeted management (e.g. ECG (electrocardiogram) and tumour surveillance in BWS, growth treatment in SRS). The molecular diagnosis furthermore provides the basis for genetic counselling. However, it has to be considered that recurrence risk calculation is determined by the phenotypic consequences of each molecular alteration and mechanism by which the alteration arose. KEY MESSAGES: The detection rates for the typical molecular defects of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome or Silver-Russell syndrome (BWS, SRS) are lower in routine cohorts than in clinically well-characterised ones. A broad spectrum of (unexpected) molecular alterations in both disorders can be identified. Multilocus imprinting disturbances (MLID) are less frequent in SRS than expected. The frequency of MLID and uniparental diploidy in BWS is confirmed. Mosaicism is a diagnostic challenge in BWS and SRS. The precise determination of the molecular defects affecting is the basis for a targeted clinical management and genetic counselling.","Eggermann, Thomas; Brück, Johanna; Knopp, Cordula; Fekete, György; Kratz, Christian; Tasic, Velibor; Kurth, Ingo; Elbracht, Miriam; Eggermann, Katja; Begemann, Matthias",,283,26

In total, 211 unique profiles explicitly referenced COVID-19; 185 (85.8%) evoked risk reduction strategies, including discontinuation of in-person services (41.2%), pivoting to virtual services (38.9%), COVID-19 status disclosure (20.9%), enhanced sanitary and screening requirements (12.3%) and restricted travel (5.2%). Some profiles, however, seemed to downplay the seriousness of COVID-19 or resist protective measures (14.7%). CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the contention that COVID-19 has dramatically impacted the sex industry; globally, male sex workers may be facing considerable economic strain. Targeted education and outreach are needed to support male sex workers grappling with COVID-19, including around the most effective risk reduction strategies. Those involved with the sex industry must have access to state-sponsored COVID-19 financial and other aid programmes to support individual and public health.","Callander, Denton; Meunier, Étienne; DeVeau, Ryan; Grov, Christian; Donovan, Basil; Minichiello, Victor; Kim, Jules; Duncan, Dustin",Sex. transm. infect,283,16
275693,275693,275693,Exposure to Urbanized Poverty and Attitude Change: A Longitudinal Case Study on Service-Learning with Rural Undergraduate Criminal Justice Students,15.14209,2.309727,2020,"It is widely believed that infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus triggers a disproportionate immune response which causes a devastating systemic injury, particularly in individuals with obesity, itself a chronic, multi-organ inflammatory disease. Immune cells accumulate in visceral adipose tissue and together with paracrine adipocytes release a wide range of biologically active cytokines (including IL-1ß, IL5, IL6 and IL8) that can result in both local, pulmonary and systemic inflammation. A more intense 'cytokine storm' is postulated as the mechanism behind the extreme immune response seen in severe COVID-19. It is striking how dangerous the combination of obesity and COVID-19 is, resulting in a greater risk of ICU admission and a higher mortality. Furthermore, patients from a BAME background appear to have increased mortality after SARS-CoV-2 infection; they also have a higher prevalence of central obesity and its metabolic complications. In the absence of an effective vaccine, the therapeutic potential of immune-modulating drugs is a priority, but the development of new drugs is expensive and time-consuming. A more pragmatic solution would be to seek to repurpose existing drugs, particularly those that might suppress the heightened cytokine activity seen in obesity, the major risk factor for a poor prognosis in COVID-19. Montelukast is a cysteinyl leukotriene receptor antagonist licensed to treat asthma and allergic rhinitis. It has been shown to diminish pulmonary response to antigen, tissue eosinophilia and IL-5 expression in inflammatory cells. It has also been shown to decrease elevated levels of IL-1ß and IL8 in humans with viral upper respiratory tract infections compared with placebo-treated patients. In addition, in silico studies have demonstrated a high binding affinity of the montelukast molecule to the terminal site of the virus's main protease enzyme which is needed for virus RNA synthesis and replication. Montelukast, which is cheap, safe and widely available would appear to have the potential to be an ideal candidate drug for clinical trials, particularly in early stage disease before irreparable tissue damage has already occurred. HYPOTHESIS: Through a direct anti-viral effect, or by suppression of heightened cytokine release in response to SARS-CoV-2, montelukast will reduce the severity of immune-mediated multiorgan damage resulting from COVID-19, particularly in patients with central obesity and metabolic syndrome.","Almerie, Muhammad Qutayba; Kerrigan, David Daniel",Med Hypotheses,283,24

METHODS: Data were collected on a self-administered questionnaire through the website of a tertiary care center (February 9-18, 2021). RESULTS: Among 1,965 respondents, 1,436 (73.1%), 453 (23.1%), and 76 (3.9%) declared themselves in favor, hesitant, or against the COVID-19 vaccine: <60% of auxiliary nurses and technicians intended to be vaccinated, as compared to 60-79% of nurses and support staff, and>80% of medical staff. On multivariate analysis, age, occupation, flu vaccine history, and controversy over the AstraZeneca vaccine tolerability were independently associated with COVID-19 vaccine intention. CONCLUSIONS: Patterns of vaccine hesitancy related to the COVID-19 and influenza vaccines are similar among HCWs.

We conducted a living systematic review and meta-analysis to address three questions: (1) Amongst people who become infected with SARS-CoV-2, what proportion does not experience symptoms at all during their infection? (2) Amongst people with SARS-CoV-2 infection who are asymptomatic when diagnosed, what proportion will develop symptoms later? (3) What proportion of SARS-CoV-2 transmission is accounted for by people who are either asymptomatic throughout infection or presymptomatic? METHODS AND FINDINGS: We searched PubMed, Embase, bioRxiv, and medRxiv using a database of SARS-CoV-2 literature that is updated daily, on 25 March 2020, 20 April 2020, and 10 June 2020. Studies of people with SARS-CoV-2 diagnosed by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) that documented follow-up and symptom status at the beginning and end of follow-up or modelling studies were included. One reviewer extracted data and a second verified the extraction, with disagreement resolved by discussion or a third reviewer. Risk of bias in empirical studies was assessed with an adapted checklist for case series, and the relevance and credibility of modelling studies were assessed using a published checklist. We included a total of 94 studies. The overall estimate of the proportion of people who become infected with SARS-CoV-2 and remain asymptomatic throughout infection was 20% (95% confidence interval [CI] 17-25) with a prediction interval of 3%-67% in 79 studies that addressed this review question. There was some evidence that biases in the selection of participants influence the estimate. In seven studies of defined populations screened for SARS-CoV-2 and then followed, 31% (95% CI 26%-37%, prediction interval 24%-38%) remained asymptomatic. The proportion of people that is presymptomatic could not be summarised, owing to heterogeneity. The secondary attack rate was lower in contacts of people with asymptomatic infection than those with symptomatic infection (relative risk 0.35, 95% CI 0.10-1.27). Modelling studies fit to data found a higher proportion of all SARS-CoV-2 infections resulting from transmission from presymptomatic individuals than from asymptomatic individuals. Limitations of the review include that most included studies were not designed to estimate the proportion of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections and were at risk of selection biases; we did not consider the possible impact of false negative RT-PCR results, which would underestimate the proportion of asymptomatic infections; and the database does not include all sources. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this living systematic review suggest that most people who become infected with SARS-CoV-2 will not remain asymptomatic throughout the course of the infection. The contribution of presymptomatic and asymptomatic infections to overall SARS-CoV-2 transmission means that combination prevention measures, with enhanced hand hygiene, masks, testing tracing, and isolation strategies and social distancing, will continue to be needed.","Buitrago-Garcia, Diana; Egli-Gany, Dianne; Counotte, Michel J; Hossmann, Stefanie; Imeri, Hira; Ipekci, Aziz Mert; Salanti, Georgia; Low, Nicola",PLoS Med,283,12

We are witnessing a helpless situation due to COVID-19 as no vaccine or drug is effective against the disease. In the present study, we have tested the applicability of some combination drugs against COVID-19. We have tried to understand the mechanism of action of some repurposed drugs: Favipiravir (F), Hydroxychloroquine (H) and Oseltamivir (O). The ADME analysis have suggested strong inhibitory possibility of F, H, O combination towards receptor protein of $3CL^{pro}$ of SARS-CoV-2 virus. The strong binding affinity, number of hydrogen bond interaction between inhibitor, receptor and lower inhibition constant computed from molecular docking validated the better complexation possibility of F+H+O: $3CL^{pro}$ combination. Various thermodynamical output from Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations like potential energy ($E_g$), temperature (T), density, pressure, SASA energy, interaction energies, Gibbs free energy ($\Delta G_{bind}$) etc., also favored the complexation between F+H+O and CoV-2 protease.

Irrational beliefs were indexed by belief in COVID-19 conspiracy theories, COVID-19 knowledge overestimation, type I error cognitive biases, and cognitive intuition. Participants (N = 407) reported (1) how often they followed guidelines (e.g., handwashing, physical distancing), (2) how often they engaged in pseudoscientific practices (e.g., consuming garlic, colloidal silver), and (3) their intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Conspiratorial beliefs predicted all three outcomes in line with our expectations. Cognitive intuition and knowledge overestimation predicted lesser adherence to guidelines, while cognitive biases predicted greater adherence, but also greater use of pseudoscientific practices. Our results suggest an important relation between irrational beliefs and health behaviors, with conspiracy theories being the most detrimental.","Teovanovic, Predrag; Lukic, Petar; Zupan, Zorana; Lazic, Aleksandra; Ninkovic, Milica; Zezelj, Iris",Appl. cogn. psychol,283,5

RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 may enter into the host cell by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. This receptor seems to be widely expressed in different testicular cell types, making possible the occurrence of orchitis in male patients with COVID-19 infection. From a review of the literature, it seems that there is currently no evidence of sexual transmission of SARS-CoV-2; however, the possibility of virus-induced testis damage and dysfunction cannot be excluded.

Considering the different roles of autophagy during viral infection, including SARS-CoV-2 infection, in this review, we discuss several clinically used drugs that have effects at different stages of autophagy. Among them, we mention (1) lysosomotropic agents, which can prevent CoVs infection by alkalinizing the acid pH in the endolysosomal system, such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, artemisinins, two-pore channel modulators and imatinib; (2) protease inhibitors that can inhibit the proteolytic cleavage of the spike CoVs protein, which is necessary for viral entry into host cells, such as camostat mesylate, lopinavir, umifenovir and teicoplanin and (3) modulators of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathways, such as rapamycin, heparin, glucocorticoids, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (IECAs) and cannabidiol. Thus, this review aims to highlight and discuss autophagy-related drugs for COVID-19, from in vitro to in vivo studies.

The study took place in Ekaterinburg (Russian Federation).Methods A total of 157 HCWs from three different clinics (56, 60 and 41 HCWs, respectively) who worked during the COVID-19 pandemic period (May to August 2020) constituted the cohort. All of the three chosen clinics had followed COVID-19 screening, triage and other recommendations for safe practice. In addition to using personal protective equipment and other common barrier methods to lower virus transmission, these clinics were equipped with different types of aspirating systems that included V6000 used in dry mode, V6000 used in semi-dry mode and VS900, respectively. All HCWs underwent serological testing once a week to detect immunoglobulin G and M antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 using SARS-CoV-2-IgG-EIA-BEST and SARS-CoV-2-IgM-EIA-BEST enzyme immunoassay kits (Vector-Best).Results An overall prevalence of seropositivity was observed to be 11.5% (19/157 HCWs) over a five-month follow-up. The prevalence of infection was not found to be associated with sex or the role of the member in the dental team (dentist/dental assistant). Significantly higher infection rates (p <0.001) were observed among HCWs working in the clinic equipped with the VS900 aspirating vacuum pump without HEPA filters, while the lowest infection rate was found among HCWs working in the clinic using the V6000 aspirating system in dry mode.Conclusions HCWs working in the clinic equipped with an aspirating system which has HEPA filters and released the air into an external environment (V6000) exhibited significantly lower seroprevalence rates compared to HCWs in the clinic using an aspirating system without HEPA filters which released air within the dental operatory away from the operation site (VS900).","Gugnani, Neeraj; Gugnani, Shalini",Evid Based Dent,283,1

The aim of this study is to analyse the efficiency in the management of hospital beds before the COVID-19 outbreak at regional level in France, Germany, Italy and Spain. This analysis can indicate a reference point for future analysis on resource management in emergency periods and help hospital managers, emergency planners as well as policy makers to put in place a rapid and effective response to an emergency situation. The results of this study clearly underline that France and Germany could rely on the robust structural components of the hospital system, compared to Italy and Spain. Presumably, this might have had an impact on the efficacy in the management of the COVID-19 diffusion. In particular, the high availability of beds in the majority of the France regions paired with the low occupancy rate and high turnover interval led these regions to have a high number of available beds. Consider also that this country generally manages complex cases. A similar structural component is present in the German regions where the number of available beds is significantly higher than in the other countries. The impact of the COVID-19 was completely different in Italy and Spain that had to deal with a relevant large number of patients relying on a reduced number of both hospital beds and professionals. A further critical factor compared to France and Germany concerns the dissimilar distribution of cases across regions. Even if in these countries the hospital beds were efficiently managed, the concentration of hospitalized patients and the scarcity of beds have put pressure on the hospital systems.","Pecoraro, Fabrizio; Luzi, Daniela; Clemente, Fabrizio",PLoS One,283,12

Here we report that astrocytes also play a role in cortical neurons' vulnerability to Herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1) infection through the release of extracellular ATP. We found that the interaction of HSV-1 with heparan sulfate proteoglycans expressed on the plasma membrane of astrocytes triggered phospholipase C-mediated IP3 -dependent intracellular Ca2+ transients causing extracellular release of ATP. ATP binds membrane purinergic P2 receptors (P2Rs) of both neurons and astrocytes causing an increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration that activates the Glycogen Synthase Kinase (GSK)-3ß, whose action is necessary for HSV-1 entry/replication in these cells. Indeed, in co-cultures of neurons and astrocytes HSV-1-infected neurons were only found in proximity of infected astrocytes releasing ATP, whereas in the presence of fluorocitrate, an inhibitor of astrocyte metabolism, switching-off the HSV-1-induced ATP release, very few neurons were infected. The addition of exogenous ATP, mimicking that released by astrocytes after HSV-1 challenge, restored the ability of HSV-1 to infect neurons co-cultured with metabolically-inhibited astrocytes. The ATP-activated, P2R-mediated, and GSK-3-dependent molecular pathway underlying HSV-1 infection is likely shared by neurons and astrocytes, given that the blockade of either P2Rs or GSK-3 activation inhibited infection of both cell types. These results add a new layer of information to our understanding of the critical role played by astrocytes in regulating neuronal functions and their response to noxious stimuli including microbial agents via Ca2+ -dependent release of neuroactive molecules.","Li Puma, Domenica Donatella; Marcocci, Maria Elena; Lazzarino, Giacomo; De Chiara, Giovanna; Tavazzi, Barbara; Palamara, Anna Teresa; Piacentini, Roberto; Grassi, Claudio",GLIA,283,29

However, an adjustment in subsidy schemes and breakout of COVID-19 appear to slow down the uptake of NEVs in the Chinese market. This raises the question of whether, other less costly, policy instruments can help the transformation towards cleaner vehicles. With the understanding that public support and user acceptance play a key role, we ask whether NEVs as part of increasingly popular car-sharing mode can gain further support, the increased uptake of new energy vehicles. To investigate this question, we perform an online survey, retrieving 1583 questionnaires, and scrutinize the perception of NEVs at the nexus with car-sharing. Relying on the Theory of Planned Behavior and ordered logistic regression model, we demonstrate that attitudes towards environmental protection and perceived benefits (economic and safety) play a key role in accelerating the adoption of shared electric cars. NEVs promotion policies need to specifically target groups by regions. Municipal agencies can substantially support NEV uptake by providing on-street parking exclusively for shared NEVs in cities, and information on the economic and social benefits of NEVs in rural areas.","Hu, Jia-Wei Javaid Aneeque Creutzig Felix",Energy Policy,283,12

Prospective study that enrolled critically ill adults with suspected COVID-19 pneumonia between June 2, 2020 and August 11, 2020. Critically ill adults with suspected COVID-19 pneumonia who required mechanical ventilation within 24 h after hospital admission were followed until death or hospital discharge. Sequential ultrasonography screening of the lower extremities and catheter insertion sites, as well as testing for plasma biochemical markers, were performed at the intensive care unit admission, day 3, day 7, and day 14. The primary outcome was a composite of deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and thrombosis at the central catheter insertion sites. We enrolled 70 patients, including 57 patients with COVID-19 and 13 patients without COVID-19, and all patients completed follow-up. The incidence of the primary outcome was higher among patients with COVID-19 than among patients with respiratory failure related to other etiologies (36.8% vs. 0%, p = 0.023).

Notably, fewer patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 progress from acute disease onset to death compared with the progression rate associated with two other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Several research organizations and pharmaceutical industries have attempted to develop successful vaccine candidates for the prevention of COVID-19. However, increasing evidence indicates that the SARS-CoV-2 genome undergoes frequent mutation;thus, an adequate analysis of the viral strain remains necessary to construct effective vaccines. The current study attempted to design a multi-epitope vaccine by utilizing an approach based on the SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins. We predicted the antigenic T- and B-lymphocyte responses to four structural proteins after screening all structural proteins according to specific characteristics. The predicted epitopes were combined using suitable adjuvants and linkers, and a secondary structure profile indicated that the vaccine shared similar properties with the native protein. Importantly, the molecular docking analysis and molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the constructed vaccine possessed a high affinity for toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). In addition, multiple descriptors were obtained from the simulation trajectories, including the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD), root-mean-square fluctuation (RMSF), solvent-accessible surface area (SASA), and radius of gyration (R-g), demonstrating the rigid nature and inflexibility of the vaccine and receptor molecules. In addition, codon optimization, based on Escherichia coli K12, was used to determine the GC content and the codon adaptation index (CAI) value, which further followed for the incorporation into the cloning vector pET28+(a). Collectively, these findings suggested that the constructed vaccine could be used to modulate the immune reaction against SARS-CoV-2.","Obaidullah, A. J.; Alanazi, M. M.; Alsaif, N.

Stress influences health behaviors, including those related to dietary behaviors, alcohol, and sleep; yet the effects of stress can be mitigated by resilience. To date, past research studying the connections between dietary behaviors, alcohol misuse, sleep, and resilience commonly investigated singular relationships between two of the constructs. The aim of the current study was to explore the relationships between these constructs in a more holistic manner using mediation and moderation analyses. METHODS: Higher education students from China, Ireland, Malaysia, South Korea, Taiwan, the Netherlands, and the United States were enrolled in a cross-sectional study from April to May 2020, which was during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic for most participants. An online survey, using validated tools, was distributed to assess perceived stress, dietary behaviors, alcohol misuse, sleep quality and duration, and resilience. RESULTS: 2254 students completed the study. Results indicated that sleep quality mediated the relationship between perceived stress and dietary behaviors as well as the relationship between perceived stress and alcohol misuse. Further, increased resilience reduced the strength of the relationship between perceived stress and dietary behaviors but not alcohol misuse. CONCLUSION: Based on these results, higher education students are likely to benefit from sleep education and resilience training, especially during stressful events.","Du, Chen; Zan, Megan Chong Hueh; Cho, Min Jung; Fenton, Jenifer I; Hsiao, Pao Ying; Hsiao, Richard; Keaver, Laura; Lai, Chang-Chi; Lee, HeeSoon; Ludy, Mary-Jon; Shen, Wan; Swee, Winnie Chee Siew; Thrivikraman, Jyothi; Tseng, Kuo-Wei; Tseng, Wei-Chin; Doak, Stephen; Folk, Sara Yi Ling; Tucker, Robin M",Nutrients,283,20

However, when answering a decision problem with a DP mechanism, it causes a two-sided error. This characteristic of DP is not desirable when publishing risk information such as concerning COVID-19. This paper proposes relaxing DP to mitigate the limitation and improve the utility of published information. First, we define a policy that separates information into sensitive and non-sensitive. Then, we define asymmetric differential privacy (ADP) that provides the same privacy guarantee as DP to sensitive information. This partial protection induces asymmetricity in privacy protection to improve utility and allow a one-sided error mechanism. Following ADP, we propose two mechanisms for two tasks based on counting query with utilizing these characteristics: top-$k$ query and publishing risk information of viruses with an accuracy guarantee. Finally, we conducted experiments to evaluate proposed algorithms using real-world datasets and show their practicality and improvement of the utility, comparing state-of-the-art algorithms.","Takagi, Shun; Cao, Yang; Yoshikawa, Masatoshi",,283,16

METHODS: The medical workers from multiple hospitals in Hubei Province, China, volunteered to participate in this cross-sectional study. An online questionnaire, including Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS) and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), was used to evaluate sleep disturbances and mental status. Sleep disturbances were defined as PSQI>6 points or/and AIS>6 points. We compared the scores of PSQI, AIS, anxiety and depression VAS, as well as prevalence of sleep disturbances between FMW and non-FMW. RESULTS: A total of 1306 subjects (801 FMW and 505 non-FMW) were enrolled. Compared to non-FMW, FMW had significantly higher scores of PSQI (9.3 ± 3.8 vs 7.5 ± 3.7; P < 0.001; Cohen's d = 0.47), AIS (6.9 ± 4.3 vs 5.3 ± 3.8; P < 0.001; Cohen's d = 0.38), anxiety (4.9 ± 2.7 vs 4.3 ± 2.6; P < 0.001; Cohen's d = 0.22) and depression (4.1 ± 2.5 vs 3.6 ± 2.4; P = 0.001; Cohen's d = 0.21), as well as higher prevalence of sleep disturbances according to PSQI > 6 points (78.4% vs 61.0%; relative risk [RR] = 1.29; P < 0.001) and AIS > 6 points (51.7% vs 35.6%; RR = 1.45; P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: FMW have higher prevalence of sleep disturbances and worse sleep quality than non-FMW.

Most of the RNA viruses causing illnesses in humans are of zoonotic origin. Zoonotic viruses can directly be transferred from animals to humans through adaptation, followed by human-to-human transmission, such as in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and, more recently, SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), or they can be transferred through insects or vectors, as in the case of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV), Zika virus (ZIKV), and dengue virus (DENV). At the present, there are no vaccines or antiviral compounds against most of these viruses. Because proteins possess a vast array of functions in all known biological systems, proteomics-based strategies can provide important insights into the investigation of disease pathogenesis and the identification of promising antiviral drug targets during an epidemic or pandemic. Mass spectrometry technology has provided the capacity required for the precise identification and the sensitive and high-throughput analysis of proteins on a large scale and has contributed greatly to unravelling key protein-protein interactions, discovering signaling networks, and understanding disease mechanisms.

METHODS: From April 2020, conventional smears during FNAC were ceased according to World Health Organization recommendations due to the increased infection risk for operators, and a new protocol using only liquid-based cytology (LBC) was adopted. FNACs performed between April and July 2020 (COVID-19 group) were retrospectively compared with those from December 2019 through March 2020 (Pre-COVID-19 group). The distribution of diagnoses based on SIAPEC-IAP categories and the concordance between cytological and histological results were compared using the chi-squared test. RESULTS: Categories based on FNAC for 90 and 82 thyroid nodules in the Pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 groups showed no significant difference in distribution (P = .081), with the following respective cases (and percentages): TIR1, 7 (8%) and 8 (10%); TIR1C, 0 (0%) and 6 (7%); TIR2, 59 (66%) and 55 (67%); TIR3A, 8 (9%) and 5 (6%); TIR3B, 1 (1%) and 2 (3%); TIR4, 5 (6%) and 1 (1%); and TIR5, 10 (12%) and 5 (7%).

To fight against COVID-19 in a more efficient way, drug-drug or drug-herb combinations are frequently used in clinical settings.

This study aims to assay the inhibitory potentials of Qingfei Paidu decoction (QPD, a Chinese medicine compound formula recommended for combating COVID-19 in China) against human drug-metabolizing enzymes and to assess the pharmacokinetic interactions in vivo. The results demonstrated that QPD dose-dependently inhibited CYPs1A, 2A6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 2E1 but inhibited CYP3A in a time- and NADPH-dependent manner. In vivo test showed that QPD prolonged the half-life of lopinavir (a CYP3A substrate-drug) by 1.40-fold and increased the AUC of lopinavir by 2.04-fold, when QPD (6 g/kg) was co-administrated with lopinavir (160 mg/kg) to rats.

METHODS: We created a derivation rule and a validation rule for ICU admission using data from a national registry of a cohort of patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who were admitted between March and August 2020 (N = 16,298). We analyzed the available demographic, clinical, radiological, and laboratory variables recorded at hospital admission. We evaluated the performance of the risk score by estimating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Using the ß coefficients of the regression model, we developed a score (0 to 100 points) associated with ICU admission. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 67 years; 57% were men. A total of 1,420 (8.7%) patients were admitted to the ICU. The variables independently associated with ICU admission were age, dyspnea, Charlson Comorbidity Index score, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, lactate dehydrogenase levels, and presence of diffuse infiltrates on a chest X-ray. The model showed an AUROC of 0.780 (CI: 0.763-0.797) in the derivation cohort and an AUROC of 0.734 (CI: 0.708-0.761) in the validation cohort. A score of greater than 75 points was associated with a more than 30% probability of ICU admission while a score of less than 50 points reduced the likelihood of ICU admission to 15%. CONCLUSION: A simple prediction score was a useful tool for forecasting the probability of ICU admission with a high degree of precision.","Ena, Javier; Vicente Segura-Heras, José; Fonseca-Aizpuru, Eva María; López-Reboiro, Manuel Lorenzo; Gracia-Gutiérrez, Anyuli; Ángel Martín-Oterino, José; Diez-Canseco, Anabel Martin-Urda; Pérez-García, Cristina; Manuel Ramos-Rincón, José; Gómez-Huelgas, Ricardo",Rev. clin. esp.

The objective of this work was to evaluate the incidence of aPL antibodies in patients hospitalized in conventional unit for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection and confirmed venous thromboembolic events (VTE) associated with aPL antibodies. 41 patients infected with COVID-19 were tested for aPL antibodies. None had reported history of aPL syndrome. Arterial and venous duplex ultrasound of lower limbs was performed in all patients at Day 0 and Day 5. All patients had antithrombotic-prophylaxis upon admission using lower molecular weight heparin with Enoxaparin. Biological parameters were collected and analyzed. Nine patients (22%) developed VTE and seven (17%) were positive for aPL antibodies of which five had isolated positive lupus anticoagulant. The sixth patient was double aPL positive IgM anticardiolipin (147.8âU/ml) and anti-Beta2 Glyco protein 1 (97.3âU/ml) antibodies. The seventh was triple positive, IgM anticardiolipin 85.6âUI/ml, IgM anti-Beta2 Glyco protein 1 63.0âU/ml and positive lupus anticoagulant. Among the seven patients with aPL antibodies 2 (28.60%) had VTE.

In response, hospital-based transfusion medicine physicians instituted policies to conserve blood and decrease blood product usage. These efforts were aided by the US Surgeon General recommendation to cancel all elective procedures. Nevertheless, the duration, severity, and impact of the pandemic on the national blood supply was uncertain. Hospitals with in-house donor programs had the opportunity not only to control demand, but also increase supply. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A hospital-based blood donor center was rapidly mobilized to increase the supply of in-house collected blood, in order to counteract a sudden but potentially long-term depletion of the national blood supply during a pandemic. RESULTS: Collections increased approximately five-fold above baseline for whole blood units, while apheresis platelet units were maintained at the historical average for the blood donor center. Cancellation of elective procedures showed a modest, but not yet statistically significant decrease in average blood product usage per day, nevertheless the in-house collection rate was sufficient to meet demand. CONCLUSION: A hospital-based blood donor center can quickly increase collection volumes and capacity in the face of a national emergency or pandemic. The desire to collect units should be balanced with safety concerns, need for sustainability, and blood product demand.","Gniadek, Thomas J; Mallek, Jessica; Wright, Gregory; Saporito, Catherine; AbiMansour, Nasri; Tangazi, Wilkister; Rogers, Gloria; Zahara, Zachary; Cummings, Gabrielle; Kaul, Karen; Kang, Jason",Transfusion,283,15

However, detailed characterization of the host-virus interplay in infected human lung and intestinal epithelial cells is lacking. METHODS: We utilized immunofluorescence assays, flow cytometry, and RT-qPCR to delineate the virological features and the innate immune response of the host cells against SARS-CoV-2 infection in two prototype human cell lines representing the human lung (Calu3) and intestinal (Caco2) epithelium when compared with SARS-CoV. RESULTS: Lung epithelial cells were significantly more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 compared to SARS-CoV. However, SARS-CoV-2 infection induced an attenuated pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines induction and type I and type II IFN responses. A single dose of 10â¯U/mL interferon-ß (IFNß) pretreatment potently protected both Calu3 and Caco2 against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 was more sensitive to the pretreatment with IFNß and IFN inducer than SARS-CoV in Calu3. CONCLUSIONS: Despite robust infection in both human lung and intestinal epithelial cells, SARS-CoV-2 could attenuate the virus-induced pro-inflammatory response and IFN response. Pre-activation of the type I IFN signaling pathway primed a highly efficient antiviral response in the host against SARS-CoV-2 infection, which could serve as a potential therapeutic and prophylactic maneuver to COVID-19 patients.","Shuai, Huiping; Chu, Hin; Hou, Yuxin; Yang, Dong; Wang, Yixin; Hu, Bingjie; Huang, Xiner; Zhang, Xi; Chai, Yue; Cai, Jian-Piao; Chan, Jasper Fuk-Woo; Yuen, Kwok-Yung",J Infect,283,16

This transformation included changes in students? contact hours, the use of technologies in classroom and laboratories, and the implementation of active self-directed learning. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of these pedagogical changes on students? academic and mental states. To achieve this goal, we proposed two questions: First question was to examine whether there was a difference between male and female students? exam grades in the brain and behavior module during the COVID-19 lockdown. In the second question, we examined whether there was a difference between students? stress level in all age groups (22-24), (25-28) and 29 and above during the pandemic lockdown. This study employed a between-subject design and utilized convenience sampling technique to include 79 first-year medical students. The present study included the following variables: students module final exam grades, students? perception about their stress levels during COVID-19 and their age groups (22-24), (25-28) and 29 and above. We first used a comparison design between male and female students? academic performance during COVID-19. Further, we used a comparison design to compare between students? stress level in all age groups (22-24), (25-28) and 29 and above during the pandemic lockdown. In the first question, the result of the one-way between subject's ANOVA found that there was no statistically significant difference between male and female student? grades in the brain and behavior module during the pandemic lockdown. These findings suggest that both male and female students were able to overcome many of the challenges triggered by the COVID-19 in the learning environment and succeed in this module. In the second question, the one-way between subject's ANOVA found that there was no statistically significant difference between students? stress level in all age groups (22-24), (25-28) and 29 and above during the pandemic lockdown. These findings suggest that students in all ages felt the same level of stress during the COVID-19 lockdown. We concluded that there was no difference in students? final grades during pandemic, regardless of their gender, where all students maintained a high level of academic success. Additionally, students in all age groups were subjected to the same level of stress during COVID-19.

Intensive control measures stabilized the spread of COVID-19 in Korea. Therefore, the Korean government introduced the policy of ""distancing in daily life"" to support the maintenance of normal life starting on March 22, 2020. This policy provides rules and guidelines on distancing in daily life to facilitate the control of COVID-19 in Korea. ""Distancing in daily life"" refers to a new, sustainable way of life and social interactions that prepares society to face the possibility of long-term prevalence of COVID-19. These guidelines aim to achieve the goal of infection prevention and containment, while sustaining people's everyday life, economic, and social activities. All members of society and communities are called upon to fulfill their respective responsibilities to combat the COVID-19 pandemic and to safeguard everyone's health and well-being. Five key rules govern personal distancing in daily life: stay home for 3­4 days if you feel unwell; keep a distance of 2 arms' length from others; wash your hands for 30 seconds and cough or sneeze into your sleeve; ventilate spaces at least twice a day and disinfect regularly; and stay connected while physically distancing.

Other epidemic Betacoronaviruses include the 2003 SARS-CoV-1 and the 2009 Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), the genomes of which, particularly that of SARS-CoV-1, are similar to that of the 2019 SARS-CoV-2. In this extensive review, we document the most recent information on Coronavirus proteins, with emphasis on the membrane proteins in the Coronaviridae family. We include information on their structures, functions, and participation in pathogenesis. While the shared proteins among the different coronaviruses may vary in structure and function, they all seem to be multifunctional, a common theme interconnecting these viruses. Many transmembrane proteins encoded within the SARS-CoV-2 genome play important roles in the infection cycle while others have functions yet to be understood. We compare the various structural and nonstructural proteins within the Coronaviridae family to elucidate potential overlaps and parallels in function, focusing primarily on the transmembrane proteins and their influences on host membrane arrangements, secretory pathways, cellular growth inhibition, cell death and immune responses during the viral replication cycle. We also offer bioinformatic analyses of potential viroporin activities of the membrane proteins and their sequence similarities to the Envelope (E) protein. In the last major part of the review, we discuss complement, stimulation of inflammation, and immune evasion/suppression that leads to CoV-derived severe disease and mortality. The overall pathogenesis and disease progression of CoVs is put into perspective by indicating several stages in the resulting infection process in which both host and antiviral therapies could be targeted to block the viral cycle.

Telemedicine has rapidly emerged as a critical technology enabling health care visits to continue while supporting social distancing to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission among patients, families, and clinicians. This model of patient care is being utilized at major cancer centers around the USA-and tele-oncology (telemedicine in oncology) has rapidly become the primary method of providing cancer care. However, most clinicians have little experience and inadequate training in this new form of care delivery. Because many practicing oncology clinicians are not familiar with telemedicine technology and the best practices for virtual communication, we strongly believe that training in this field is essential. Utilizing best practices of communication skills training, this paper presents a brief tele-oncology communication guide (Comskil TeleOnc) to address the timely need to maximize high-quality care to patients with cancer. The goal of the Comskil TeleOnc Guide is to recognize, elicit, and effectively respond to patients' medical needs and concerns while utilizing empathic responses to communicate understanding, alleviate distress, and provide support via videoconferencing. We recommend five strategies to achieve the communication goal outlined above: (1) Establish the clinician-patient relationship/create rapport, (2) set the agenda, (3) respond empathically to emotions, (4) deliver the information, and (5) effectively end the tele-oncology visit. The guide proposed in this paper is not all-encompassing and may not be applicable to all health care institutions; however, it provides a practical, patient-centered framework to conduct a tele-oncology visit.","Banerjee, Smita C; Staley, Jessica M; Howell, Frances; Malling, Charlotte; Moreno, Aimee; Kotsen, Chris; Parikh, Dhwani; Parker, Patricia A",J. cancer educ,283,16

However, internet searches are a complex and dynamic process that can be fraught with subtleties and potential error. The mechanics of searching for and using electronic health (eHealth) information is ostensibly cognitively demanding; yet we know little about the role of neurocognitive abilities in this regard. Fifty-six young adults completed two naturalistic eHealth search tasks: fact-finding (eHealth Fact) and symptom-diagnosis (eHealth Search). Participants also completed neurocognitive tests of attention, psychomotor speed, learning/memory, and executive functions. Shorter eHealth symptom-diagnosis search time was related to better executive functions, while better eHealth symptom-diagnosis search accuracy was related to better episodic and prospective memory. In contrast, neither eHealth Fact search time nor its accuracy were related to any of the neurocognitive measures. Our findings suggest a differential relationship between neurocognitive abilities and eHealth search behaviors among young adults such that higher-order abilities may be implicated in eHealth searches requiring greater synthesis of information. Future work should examine the cognitive architecture of eHealth search in persons with neurocognitive disorders, as well as that of other aspects of eHealth search behaviors (e.g., search term generation, website reliability, and decision-making).","Kordovski, Victoria M; Babicz, Michelle A; Ulrich, Nathalie; Woods, Steven Paul",Percept Mot Skills,283,24

This fact, along with the highly technical nature of the industry standard reproducibility tools currently employed in data science, present out-of-the gate challenges in teaching reproducibility in the data science classroom. Put simply, students are not as intrinsically motivated to learn this topic, and it is not an easy one for them to learn. What can a data science educator do? Over several iterations of teaching courses focused on reproducible data science tools and workflows, we have found that providing extra motivation, guided instruction and lots of practice are key to effectively teaching this challenging, yet important subject.

Adequate understanding of the interplay between COVID-19 and CV disease is required for optimum management of these patients. METHODS: A literature search was done using PubMed and Google search engines to prepare a narrative review on this topic. RESULTS: Respiratory illness is the dominant clinical manifestation of COVID-19; CV involvement occurs much less commonly. Acute cardiac injury, defined as significant elevation of cardiac troponins, is the most commonly reported cardiac abnormality in COVID-19. It occurs in approximately 8-12% of all patients. Direct myocardial injury due to viral involvement of cardiomyocytes and the effect of systemic inflammation appear to be the most common mechanisms responsible for cardiac injury. The information about other CV manifestations in COVID-19 is very limited at present. Nonetheless, it has been consistently shown that the presence of pre-existing CV disease and/or development of acute cardiac injury are associated with significantly worse outcome in these patients. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the current reports on COVID-19 have only briefly described CV manifestations in these patients. Given the enormous burden posed by this illness and the significant adverse prognostic impact of cardiac involvement, further research is required to understand the incidence, mechanisms, clinical presentation and outcomes of various CV manifestations in COVID-19 patients.","Bansal, Manish",Diabetes Metab Syndr,283,16

Acquired GH deficiency (GHD) has been recently proposed as a risk factor for severity of COVID-19 infections. However, acquired GHD is often associated to other factors, including pituitary tumors, surgery, radiotherapy, and additional pituitary hormones deficits and their replacements, which, together, may hinder an accurate analysis of the relationship between GHD and COVID-19. Therefore, we decided to assess the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and the frequency of symptomatic cases of COVID-19 in adults subjects with untreated isolated GHD (IGHD) due to a homozygous null mutation in the GHRH receptor gene. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out in 27 adult IGHD subjects and 27 age- and gender-matched local controls. Interview, physical examination, bio-impedance, hematological and SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies were analyzed. RESULTS: There was no difference in the prevalence of positivity of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies between the two groups. Conversely, no IGHD individual had a previous clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 infection, while 6 control subjects did (p = 0.023). CONCLUSION: The production of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was similar between IGHD subjects due to a GHRH receptor gene mutation and controls, but the evolution to symptomatic stages of the infection and the frequency of confirmed cases was lower in IGHD subjects than in GH sufficient individuals.","Melo, Manuela A; Borges, Lysandro P; Salvatori, Roberto; Souza, Daniela R V; Santos-Júnior, Hertz T; de R Neto, José M; Campos, Viviane C; Santos, Aryanne A; Oliveira, Carla R P; da Invenção, Grazielly B; Batista, Vanderlan O; Matos, Igor L S; Barros-Oliveira, Cynthia S; Dos Santos, Kezia A; Santos, Elenilde G; Souza, Nicolas A A; Melo, Enaldo V; Borges, Pamela C; Santos, Saulo E F S; de Oliveira, Brenda M; Oliveira-Santos, Alécia A; de Jesus, Amélia R; Aguiar-Oliveira, Manuel H",Endocrine,283,24

The elderly, patients with comorbidities and solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients are particularly at risk. We observed a low incidence of severe disease in our population and aimed to determine the outcomes of COVID-19 (disease severity/Intensive care unit [ICU] admissions/mortality) in SOT recipients. METHODS: All SOT recipients diagnosed with COVID-19 were included. Their demographic and clinical data were recorded from the hospital electronic system. Patients were assigned to 1 of 4 stages of disease severity: A= asymptomatic, B=mild, C=moderate, and D=severe. RESULTS: Of the 3052 SOT recipients, 67 were diagnosed with COVID-19. The mean age was 52 years and 69% were male. There were approximately 25% patients in stage A, 28% in stage B, 34% in stage C and 12% in stage D. Patients in stage C and D were older than those in A (p=0.04) or B (P=0.03). Lactic dehydrogenase (p <0.01) and D-dimer (p <0.01) levels were higher across the stages.Approximately 70% of patients were admitted for a median duration of 9 days and the median follow-up was 35 days. Acute kidney injury occurred in 19% of patients, and 45% required supplementary oxygen. The symptomatic patients were treated with Hydroxychloroquine (83%), Azithromycin (89%) and Tocilizumab (23%). Around 15% of patients were admitted to ICU and 2 patients have died. CONCLUSIONS: Most SOT recipients developed mild to moderate COVID-19; few required ICU admission and 2 patients have died.

Insight into the phylodynamics and mutation variants of this virus is vital to understanding the nature of its spread in different climate conditions. The incidence rate of COVID-19 is increasing at an alarming pace within subtropical South-East Asian nations with high temperatures and humidity. To understand this spread, we analysed 444 genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 available on the GISAID platform from six South-East Asian countries. Multiple sequence alignments and maximum-likelihood phylogenetic analyses were performed to analyse and characterize the non-synonymous (NS) mutant variants circulating in this region. Global mutation distribution analysis showed that the majority of the mutations found in this region are also prevalent in Europe and North America, and the concurrent presence of these mutations at a high frequency in other countries indicates possible transmission routes. Unique spike protein and non-structural protein mutations were observed circulating within confined area of a given country. We divided the circulating viral strains into four major groups and three subgroups on the basis of the most frequent NS mutations. Strains with a unique set of four co-evolving mutations were found to be circulating at a high frequency within India, specifically. Group 2 strains characterized by two co-evolving NS mutants which alter in RdRp (P323L) and spike (S) protein (D614G) were found to be common in Europe and North America. These European and North American variants have rapidly emerged as dominant strains within South-East Asia, increasing from a 0% prevalence in January to an 81% by May 2020. These variants may have an evolutionary advantage over their ancestral types and could present a large threat to South-East Asia for the coming winter.","Islam, Ovinu Kibria; Al-Emran, Hassan M; Hasan, Md Shazid; Anwar, Azraf; Jahid, Md Iqbal Kabir; Hossain, Md Anwar",Transbound. emerg. dis.

We analysed the influence of genetics on cytokine regulation to obtain a better understanding of patient's heterogeneity. Methods: For up to N=389 genotyped participants of the PROGRESS study of hospitalised CAP patients, we performed a genome-wide association study of ten cytokines IL-1b, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, MCP-1 (MCAF), MIP-1a (CCL3), VEGF, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1. Consecutive secondary analyses were performed to identify independent hits and corresponding causal variants. Results: 102 SNPs from 14 loci showed genome-wide significant associations with five of the cytokines. The most interesting associations were found at 6p21.1 for VEGF (p=1.58x10E-20), at 17q21.32 (p=1.51x10E-9) and at 10p12.1 (p=2.76x10E-9) for IL-1b, at 10p13 for MIP-1a (CCL3) (p=2.28x10E-9), and at 9q34.12 for IL-10 (p=4.52x10E-8). Functionally plausible genes could be assigned to the majority of loci including genes involved in cytokine secretion, granulocyte function, and cilial kinetics. Conclusions: This is the first context-specific genetic association study of blood cytokine concentrations in CAP patients revealing numerous biologically plausible candidate genes.

We assessed the availability of WASH and standard precautions for infection prevention in health facilities across 18 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, as well as inequalities by location (rural/urban) and managing authority (public/private). Data from health facility surveys conducted between 2013 and 2018 in 18 sub-Saharan African countries were used to estimate the access to an improved water source within 500 m, an improved toilet, soap and running water or alcohol-based hand rub, and standard precautions for infection prevention at health facilities. Rural-urban differences and public-private differences in access to services were calculated. We also compared population level access to health facility access to services. RESULT: Overall, 16,456 health facilities from 18 countries were included. Across countries, an estimated 88 % had an improved water source, 94 % had an improved toilet, 74 % had soap and running water or alcohol-based hand rub, and 17 % had standard precautions for infection prevention available. There was wide variability in access to water, sanitation and hygiene services between rural and urban health facilities and between public and private facilities, with consistently lower access in both rural and public facilities. In both rural and urban areas, access to water, sanitation and hygiene services was ubiquitously better at health facilities than households. CONCLUSIONS: Availability of WASH services in health facilities in sub-Saharan Africa has improved but remains below the global target of 80 % in many countries. Ensuring adequate access to WASH services and enforcing adherence to safety and hygiene practices in health facilities will be essential to minimize the risk of COVID-19 transmission.","Kanyangarara, Mufaro; Allen, Savannah; Jiwani, Safia S; Fuente, David",BMC Health Serv Res,283,1

The predictive value of blood tests, performed during emergency department evaluation, was then addressed. A progressive increase of RDW was observed with advancing COVID-19 severity. The area under the curve (AUC) of RDW was 0.73 for predicting severe illness, 0.80 for severe AKI, and 0.83 for RRT, respectively. In multivariate analysis, elevated RDW was associated with 9-fold and 16-fold increased odds of severe COVID-19 and AKI, respectively. The results of this study suggest that RDW should be part of routine laboratory assessment and monitoring of COVID-19.","Henry, Brandon Michael; Benoit, Justin Lee; Benoit, Stefanie; Pulvino, Christina; Berger, Brandon A; Olivera, Maria Helena Santos de; Crutchfield, Christopher A; Lippi, Giuseppe",,283,1

We estimated the potential impact of COVID-19-related disruptions to HIV prevention/treatment services and sexual partnerships on HIV incidence and HIV-related deaths among key populations including female sex workers (FSW), their clients, men who have sex with men, and overall. SETTING: Yaoundé (Cameroon) and Cotonou (Benin). METHODS: We used mathematical models of HIV calibrated to city population-specific and risk population-specific demographic/behavioral/epidemic data. We estimated the relative change in 1-year HIV incidence and HIV-related deaths for various disruption scenarios of HIV prevention/treatment services and decreased casual/commercial partnerships, compared with a scenario without COVID-19. RESULTS: A 50% reduction in condom use in all partnerships over 6 months would increase 1-year HIV incidence by 39%, 42%, 31%, and 23% among men who have sex with men, FSW, clients, and overall in Yaoundé, respectively, and 69%, 49%, and 23% among FSW, clients, and overall, respectively, in Cotonou. Combining a 6-month interruption of ART initiation and 50% reduction in HIV prevention/treatment use would increase HIV incidence by 50% and HIV-related deaths by 20%. This increase in HIV infections would be halved by a simultaneous 50% reduction in casual and commercial partnerships. CONCLUSIONS: Reductions in condom use after COVID-19 would increase infections among key populations disproportionately, particularly FSW in Cotonou, who need uninterrupted condom provision. Disruptions in HIV prevention/treatment services have the biggest impacts on HIV infections and deaths overall, only partially mitigated by equal reductions in casual/commercial sexual partnerships. Maintaining ART provision must be prioritized to minimize short-term excess HIV-related deaths.","Silhol, Romain; Geidelberg, Lily; Mitchell, Kate M; Mishra, Sharmistha; Dimitrov, Dobromir; Bowring, Anna; Béhanzin, Luc; Guédou, Fernand; Diabaté, Souleymane; Schwartz, Sheree; Billong, Serge C; Njindam, Iliassou Mfochive; Levitt, Daniel; Mukandavire, Christinah; Maheu-Giroux, Mathieu; Rönn, Minttu M; Dalal, Shona; Vickerman, Peter; Baral, Stefan; Alary, Michel; Boily, Marie-Claude",J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr,283,23

Evidence from an asymmetric MF-DFA approach,15.20096,2.3143368,2021,"OBJECTIVES: To illustrate how patient risk and clinical costs are driven by false-positive and false-negative results. METHODS: Molecular, antigen, and antibody testing are the mainstay to identify infected patients and fight the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). To evaluate the test methods, sensitivity (percent positive agreement [PPA]) and specificity (percent negative agreement [PNA]) are the most common metrics utilized, followed by the positive and negative predictive value-the probability that a positive or negative test result represents a true positive or negative patient. The number, probability, and cost of false results are driven by combinations of prevalence, PPA, and PNA of the individual test selected by the laboratory. RESULTS: Molecular and antigen tests that detect the presence of the virus are relevant in the acute phase only. Serologic assays detect antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in the recovering and recovered phase. Each testing methodology has its advantages and disadvantages. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate the value of reporting probability of false-positive results, probability of false-negative results, and costs to patients and health care. These risk metrics can be calculated from the risk drivers of PPA and PNA combined with estimates of prevalence, cost, and Reff number (people infected by 1 positive SARS-CoV-2 carrier).","Brooks, Zoe C; Das, Saswati",Am J Clin Pathol,283,26

The aim of this review is to highlight the current advances in the pathways of neutrophilic inflammation against viral infection over the past ten years, focusing on the production of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and its impact on severe lung diseases, such as COVID-19. We focused on studies regarding hyperinflammation, cytokine storms, neutrophil function, and viral infections. We discuss how the neutrophil's role could influence COVID-19 symptoms in the interaction between hyperinflammation (overproduction of NETs and cytokines) and the clearance function of neutrophils to eliminate the viral infection. We also propose a more in-depth investigation into the neutrophil response mechanism targeting NETosis in the different phases of COVID-19.","Borges, Leandro; Pithon-Curi, Tania Cristina; Curi, Rui; Hatanaka, Elaine",Mediators Inflamm,283,16

We model various combinations of key variables to identify and compare a range of effective and practical surveillance strategies for schools and businesses. METHODS: We coupled a simulated data set incorporating actual community prevalence and test performance characteristics to a susceptible, infectious, removed (SIR) compartmental model, modeling the impact of base and tunable variables including test sensitivity, testing frequency, results lag, sample pooling, disease prevalence, externally-acquired infections, symptom checking, and test cost on outcomes including case reduction and false positives. FINDINGS: Increasing testing frequency was associated with a non-linear positive effect on cases averted over 100 days. While precise reductions in cumulative number of infections depended on community disease prevalence, testing every 3 days versus every 14 days (even with a lower sensitivity test) reduces the disease burden substantially. Pooling provided cost savings and made a high-frequency approach practical; one high-performing strategy, testing every 3 days, yielded per person per day costs as low as $1.32. INTERPRETATION: A range of practically viable testing strategies emerged for schools and businesses. Key characteristics of these strategies include high frequency testing with a moderate or high sensitivity test and minimal results delay. Sample pooling allowed for operational efficiency and cost savings with minimal loss of model performance.","Lyng, Gregory D; Sheils, Natalie E; Kennedy, Caleb J; Griffin, Daniel O; Berke, Ethan M",PLoS One,283,7

Yet, relatively little is known about attitudes towards covid-19 vaccines in these countries and in Africa in particular. In this paper, we provide cross-country comparable estimates of the willingness to accept a covid-19 vaccine in six Sub-Saharan African countries. MethodsWe use data from six national high-frequency phone surveys from countries representing 38% of the Sub-Saharan African population (Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Malawi, Mali, Nigeria, and Uganda). Samples are drawn from large, nationally representative sampling frames providing a rich set of demographic and socio-economic characteristics by which we disaggregate our analysis. Using a set of re-calibrated survey weights, our analysis adjusts for the selection biases common in remote surveys. ResultsAcceptance rates in the six Sub-Saharan African countries studied are generally high, with at least four in five people willing to be vaccinated in all but one country. Vaccine acceptance ranges from nearly universal in Ethiopia (97.9%, 97.2% to 98.6%) to below what would likely be required for herd immunity in Mali (64.5%, 61.3% to 67.8%). We find little evidence for systematic differences in vaccine hesitancy by sex or age but some clusters of hesitancy in urban areas, among the better educated, and in richer households. Safety concerns about the vaccine in general and its side effects emerge as the primary reservations toward a covid-19 vaccine across countries. ConclusionsOur findings suggest that limited supply, not inadequate demand, likely presents the key bottleneck to reaching high covid-19 vaccine coverage in Sub-Saharan Africa. To turn intent into effective demand, targeted communication campaigns bolstering confidence in the safety of approved vaccines and reducing concerns about side effects will be crucial to safeguard the swift progression of vaccine rollout in one of the worlds poorest regions.

Family and clinician perspectives about phone and video communication in the ICU during the COVID-19 pandemic are not yet well-understood. Increased knowledge about clinicians' and families' experiences with telehealth may help to improve the quality of remote interactions with families during periods of hospital visitor restrictions during COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: To explore experiences, perspectives and attitudes of family members and ICU clinicians about phone and video interactions during COVID-19 hospital visitor restrictions. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative interviewing study with an intentional sample of twenty-one family members and fourteen treating clinicians of cardiothoracic and neurologic ICU patients at an academic medical center in April 2020. Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with each participant. We used content analysis to develop a codebook and analyze interview transcripts. We specifically explored themes of effectiveness, benefits and limitations, communication strategies, and discordant perspectives between families and clinicians related to remote discussions. RESULTS: Respondents viewed phone and video communication as somewhat effective but inferior to in-person communication. Both clinicians and families thought phone calls were useful for information-sharing and brief updates, while video calls were preferable for aligning clinician and family perspectives. Clinicians and families expressed discordant views on multiple topics-for example, clinicians worried they were unsuccessful in conveying empathy remotely, while families felt empathy was conveyed successfully via phone and video. Communication strategies suggested by families and clinicians for remote interactions include identifying a family point-person to receive updates, frequently checking family understanding, positioning the camera on video calls to help family see the patient and their clinical setting, and offering time for the family and patient to interact without clinicians participating. CONCLUSIONS: Telehealth communication between families and clinicians of ICU patients appears a somewhat effective alternative when in-person communication is not possible. Use of communication strategies specific to phone and video can improve clinician and family experiences with telehealth.","Kennedy, Niki R; Steinberg, Alexis; Arnold, Robert M; Doshi, Ankur A; White, Douglas B; DeLair, Will; Nigra, Karen; Elmer, Jonathan",Ann.

Decontamination is mandatory to avoid harm and contain hazardous materials, but can delay care. Therefore, the stabilization of patients in the warm zone seems reasonable, but research is limited. Moreover, subjects involved in biological events are considered infectious even after decontamination and need to be managed while wearing personal protective equipment (PPE), as seen with Ebola and COVID-19 pandemic. With this simulation mannequin trial, we assessed the impact of CBRNe PPE on cardiopulmonary resuscitation and combat casualty care procedures. METHODS: We compared procedures performed by emergency medicine and anesthesiology senior residents, randomized in 2 groups (CBRNe PPE vs. no PPE). Chest compression (CC) depth was defined as the primary outcome. Time to completion was calculated for the following: tourniquet application; tension pneumothorax needle decompression; peripheral venous access (PVA) and intraosseous access positioning; and drug preparation and administration. A questionnaire was delivered to evaluate participants' perception. RESULTS: Thirty-six residents participated. No significant difference between the groups in CC depth (mean difference = 0.26 cm [95% confidence interval = -0.26 to 0.77 cm, P = 0.318]), as well as for CC rate, CC complete release, and time for drugs preparation and administration was detected. The PPE contributed to significantly higher times for tourniquet application, tension pneumothorax decompression, peripheral venous access, and intraosseous access positioning.

In this study, we explored the level of psychological distress that people experienced in social isolation and the factors which might ameliorate or exacerbate it. Two hundred and thirteen participants (69% female) with a mean age of 37.82 years participated in an online study. They completed a series of questions designed as part of a larger cross-national study. A positive attitude towards social isolation introduced by government as a strategy to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 was predictive of positive coping strategies, and both attitude and coping predicted reduced psychological distress. Participants' worries about contagion of COVID-19, their financial status, and the economic and political impact of the COVID-19 pandemic predicted increases in their psychological distress. Social support from family and work colleagues was not significant in reducing worries or psychological distress but it did positively predict engagement in coping. The findings and recommendations are discussed. PRACTITIONER POINTS: Fostering a positive attitude towards social isolation in clients: reduces psychological distress, fosters engagement in positive coping behaviours. Enhancing clients' level of social support received will serve to increase positive coping and indirectly reduce psychological distress during social isolation.

However, the evaluation of environmental impacts is insufficient because of the strong correlation effect between tourism and other industries. This study attempted to assess the environmental impact and cost of the tourism-induced pollutant emissions (in a broad sense) at the national scale through constructing the environmental-economic input-output model. Our results suggested that the China’s total emission of CO2, NOx, SOx related to tourism industry increased from 42 × 106 t, 162 kt, 345 kt in 1995 to 157 × 106 t, 527 kt, 854 kt in 2009. The indirect CO2, NOx, and SOx emissions of tourism and related industries were nearly 6.8–11 times of their direct emission in travel agency. Most of these indirect emissions (73% of CO2 in 2009, 54% of NOx in 1995, 62% of SOx in 2009) are derived from the energy plants and industrial sectors. The sustainable tourism should largely depend on the realization of sustainable mobility and transportation, through the low-emission behavior and energy-saving technology. The emission reduction cost of tourism industry in China was 30,170 and 172,812 million CNY in 1995 and 2009, accounting for nearly 14% of the total tourism revenue.","Shi, Yalan Yu Miaojing",Sustainability,283,5

COVID-19 is a new disease that is highly infectious and dangerous. It has deeply shaken the world, claiming the lives of over a million people and bringing the world to a lockdown. So, the early detection of COVID is essential for the patients' timely treatment and preventive measures. A filtering technique with time-varying parameters is presented to predict the stochastic volatility (SV) of COVID-19 cases. The time-varying parameters are estimated using the Kalman filtering technique based on the stochastic component of data volatility. Kalman filtering is essential as it removes insignificant information from the data. We forecast one-step-ahead predicted volatility with ± 3 standard prediction errors, which is implemented by Maximum Likelihood Estimation. We conclude that Kalman filtering in conjunction with the SV model is a reliable predictive model for COVID-19 since it is less constrained by the past autoregressive information.","Masum Bhuiyan, Md Al; Mahmud, Suhail; Islam, Md Romyull; Tasnim, Nishat",Results Phys,283,24

Identification of the main protein targets and pathways of severe cases of COVID-19 infection is the aim of this study. Methods: Published differentially expressed proteins were screened and the significant proteins were investigated via protein-protein interaction network using Cytoscape software V. 3.7.2 and STRING database. The studied proteins were assessed via action map analysis to determine the relationship between individual proteins using CluePedia. The related biological terms were investigated using ClueGO and the terms were clustered and discussed. Results: Among the 35 queried proteins, six of them (FGA, FGB, FGG, and FGl1 plus TLN1 and THBS1) were identified as critical proteins. A total of 38 biological terms, clustered in 4 groups, were introduced as the affected terms. ""Platelet degranulation"" and ""hereditary factor I deficiency disease"" were introduced as the main class of the terms disturbed by COVID-19 virus. Conclusion: It can be concluded that platelet damage and disturbed haemostasis could be the main targets in severe cases of coronavirus infection.

In this study, we examine whether the increased level of loneliness observed in the Netherlands persisted into the fall of 2020, whether there were differences in emotional, social, and existential loneliness, and whether the presence of well-known risk factors for loneliness also led to further increases in loneliness during the pandemic. METHODS: Data were obtained from the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam, with observations of 404 community-dwelling older adults aged 74 to 96 years from 2019 and fall 2020. RESULTS: Loneliness increased between 2019 and 2020, and the increase was particularly high for emotional loneliness (partial Î· 2 = 0.19). Having a partner, and a high mastery and good physical functioning before the pandemic provided some protection against an increase in loneliness. DISCUSSION: Loneliness increased for almost all older people. Targeted policies can reduce the negative impact of vulnerabilities. Efforts to combat loneliness during the pandemic should focus not only on groups traditionally considered vulnerable, such as socially isolated people, but also on older adults with a partner and who have daily contact with others.","van Tilburg, Theo G",,283,16

UVC light has been suggested as a potential option for decontamination of FFRs by the Centers for Disease Control. There has been a lack of publications characterizing UVC dose distribution across FFRs. Methods: A UVC light box and FFR rack system was assembled utilizing low pressure mercury lamps peaked at 254 nm and aluminum flashing to reduce shadowing effect. Dose was characterized with the use of UV intensity labels and a UVGI (ultraviolet germicidal irradiation) NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) traceable meter. Ozone production was evaluated after extended bulb run time. Results: Calibration of UV intensity labels were noted to have color-change saturation at 100 mJ/cm 2. Dose measurements with the UV intensity labels on the FFR demonstrated symmetric dose to all surfaces but symmetry not supported by measurements with the UVGI meter. There was substantial dose fall off on the lateral aspects of the FFR. No ozone production was noted in the UVC system. Conclusions: UV intensity labels for characterization of dose provided a false suggestion of symmetry when compared to UVGI meter. Estimates of appropriate exposure times to reach 1000 mJ/cm2 should be significantly increased to account for geometry of FFR and lateral dose fall off.,"Dunn, Emily F; Akhtar, Adil; Dunn, Adam; Lacey, Scott; Pauley, Ethan; Powers, Colton; McKee, James; Petereit, Daniel",Adv Radiat Oncol,283,11

During a time of social isolation, economic loss, psychological distress, and reduced access to health services and support networks, all of which are catalytic factors for both intentional injuries and heavy alcohol use, what is needed is individualized and population-based preventive interventions aimed at reducing alcohol consumption, rather than decisions to increase certain forms of alcohol availability.","Lange, Shannon; Probst, Charlotte; Rehm, Jürgen",Can J Public Health,283,16

The data collection techniques used were the survey and the interview. The study population consisted of 1093 teachers from official schools in Floridablanca. For the quantitative approach, a non-probabilistic accidental sample of 110 teachers was used, and for the qualitative approach, a non-probabilistic convenience sample of 10 teachers was used.

The case of the Mayan Riviera,15.416822,2.417583,2021,"BackgroundWe aimed to measure SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in a cohort of healthcare workers (HCWs) during the first UK wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, explore risk factors associated with infection, and investigate the impact of antibody titres on assay sensitivity. MethodsHCWs at Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (STH) were prospectively enrolled and sampled at two time points. SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were tested using an in-house assay for IgG and IgA reactivity against Spike and Nucleoprotein (sensitivity 99{middle dot}47%, specificity 99{middle dot}56%). Data were analysed using three statistical models: a seroprevalence model, an antibody kinetics model, and a heterogeneous sensitivity model. FindingsAs of 12th June 2020, 24{middle dot}4% (n=311/1275) HCWs were seropositive. Of these, 39{middle dot}2% (n=122/311) were asymptomatic. The highest adjusted seroprevalence was measured in HCWs on the Acute Medical Unit (41{middle dot}1%, 95% CrI 30{middle dot}0-52{middle dot}9) and in Physiotherapists and Occupational Therapists (39{middle dot}2%, 95% CrI 24{middle dot}4-56{middle dot}5). Older age groups showed overall higher median antibody titres. Further modelling suggests that, for a serological assay with an overall sensitivity of 80%, antibody titres may be markedly affected by differences in age, with sensitivity estimates of 89% in those over 60 years but 61% in those [≤]30 years. InterpretationHCWs in acute medical units working closely with COVID-19 patients were at highest risk of infection, though whether these are infections acquired from patients or other staff is unknown. Current serological assays may underestimate seroprevalence in younger age groups if validated using sera from older and/or more symptomatic individuals. Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed for studies published up to March 6th 2021, using the terms ""COVID"", ""SARS-CoV-2"", ""seroprevalence"", and ""healthcare workers"", and in addition for articles of antibody titres in different age groups against coronaviruses using ""coronavirus"", ""SARS-CoV-2, ""antibody"", ""antibody tires"", ""COVID"" and ""age"". We included studies that used serology to estimate prevalence in healthcare workers. SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence has been shown to be greater in healthcare workers working on acute medical units or within domestic services. Antibody levels against seasonal coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 were found to be higher in older adults, and patients who were hospitalised. Added value of this studyIn this healthcare worker seroprevalence modelling study at a large NHS foundation trust, we confirm that those working on acute medical units, COVID-19 ""Red Zones"" and within domestic services are most likely to be seropositive. Furthermore, we show that physiotherapists and occupational therapists have an increased risk of COVID-19 infection. We also confirm that antibody titres are greater in older individuals, even in the context of non-hospitalised cases. Importantly, we demonstrate that this can result in age-specific sensitivity in serological assays, where lower antibody titres in younger individuals results in lower assay sensitivity. Implications of all the available evidenceThere are distinct occupational roles and locations in hospitals where the risk of COVID-19 infection to healthcare workers is greatest, and this knowledge should be used to prioritise infection prevention control and other measures to protect healthcare workers. Serological assays may have different sensitivity profiles across different age groups, especially if assay validation was undertaken using samples from older and/or hospitalised patients, who tend to have higher antibody titres. Future seroprevalence studies should consider adjusting for age-specific assay sensitivities to estimate true seroprevalence rates.

Bangladesh, the most densely populated country in the world, is now under community trans-mission of the COVID-19 outbreak. This has created huge health, social, and economic burdens. Till the 10th of February 2020, Bangladesh has reported over 500,000 infected cases and 8000 deaths. To prevent further detriment in our scenario, predicting future consequences are very important. Studies have shown that machine learning(ML) models work extremely well in providing precise information regarding COVID-19 to the authorities thus enabling them to make decisions accordingly. However, to the best of our knowledge, no ML models have been applied that can help in determining the pandemic circumstance for Bangladesh demographics. In this study, we explore different machine learning algorithms that can provide more accurate estimations for predicting future cases which includes infections and deaths due to COVID-19 for Bangladesh. Based on this the government and policymakers can make a decision about the lockdown, resource mobilization, etc. Our study shows that in predicting the pandemic situations, amidst many predicting models the Facebook Prophet Model provided the best accuracy. We believe that using this information the authorities can take decisions that will lead to the saving of countless lives of the people. Additionally, this will also help to reduce the immeasurable economic burden our country is facing due to the present status quo. Furthermore, this study will help analysts to construct predicting models for future explorations. © 2021 IEEE.","Leon, M. I.; Iqbal, M. I.; Azim, S. M.; Al Mamun, K. A.","Int. Conf. Inf. Commun.

The diagnostic survey method was used in the research study. A total of 120 children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) aged 11–14 years participated in the study. The following tools were used to achieve the goal: Quality of Life of Students by S. Kowalik, “Jak Sobie Radzisz” by Z. Juczyński and N. Ogińska-Bulik and a proprietary questionnaire by the author. The research results indicate that during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, children with ASD from families with an average financial status are more satisfied with functioning in the family and more satisfied with themselves than children from families with a low financial status. Moreover, children with ASD from low-status families prefer strategies of focusing on emotions, which are not constructive and make functioning difficult, more often than their peers from families with average financial status. The results of the research show a positive correlation between the quality of life in the dimensions of satisfaction with the family, one’s local environment and oneself and active coping (disposition) and seeking social support;and a negative correlation with the strategy of focusing on emotions (disposition).

Another example is in phase II cancer studies, efficacy is often assessed as an ordinal variable based on a level of response of solid tumors with four categories: complete response, partial response, stable disease, and progression, though often a dichotomized approach is used in practices. However, there lack of designs for the ordinal endpoint despite Whitehead et al. (1993, 2017), Jaki et al. (2003) to list a few.

In brief, by using basis functions over a continuous state space, DDD allows for the fitting of continuous-time Markov chains over these basis functions and as a result continuously maps between distributions. The number of parameters in DDD scales by the square of the number of basis functions; we reformulate the problem and restrict the method to compact basis functions which leads to the inference of sparse matrices only -- hence reducing the number of parameters. Finally, we demonstrate how DDD is suitable to integrate both trajectory time series (paired between subsequent time points) and snapshot time series (unpaired time points). Methods capable of integrating both scenarios are particularly relevant for the analysis of biomedical data, whereby studies observe population at fixed time points (snapshots) and individual patient journeys with repeated follow ups (trajectories).","Taylor-King, Jake P.; Regep, Cristian; Soman, Jyothish; Tong, Flawnson; Cangea, Catalina; Roberts, Charlie",,283,20

Although underappreciated, many gut ""anaerobes"" are able to respire using oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor. The oxygen continually released from gut epithelial cells creates an oxygen gradient from the mucus layer to the anaerobic lumen [L. Albenberg et al., Gastroenterology 147, 1055-1063.e8 (2014)], with oxygen available to bacteria growing at the mucus layer. Here, we show that Bacteroides species are metabolically and energetically robust and do not mount stress responses in the presence of 0.10 to 0.14% oxygen, defined as nanaerobic conditions [A. D. Baughn, M. H. Malamy, Nature 427, 441-444 (2004)]. Taking advantage of this metabolic capability, we show that nanaerobic growth provides sufficient oxygen for the maturation of oxygen-requiring fluorescent proteins in Bacteroides species. Type strains of four different Bacteroides species show bright GFP fluorescence when grown nanaerobically versus anaerobically. We compared four different red fluorescent proteins and found that mKate2 yields the highest red fluorescence intensity in our assay. We show that GFP-tagged proteins can be localized in nanaerobically growing bacteria. In addition, we used time-lapse fluorescence microscopy to image dynamic type VI secretion system processes in metabolically active Bacteroides fragilis The ability to visualize fluorescently labeled Bacteroides and fluorescently linked proteins in actively growing nanaerobic gut symbionts ushers in an age of imaging analyses not previously possible in these bacteria.","García-Bayona, Leonor; Coyne, Michael J; Hantman, Noam; Montero-Llopis, Paula; Von, Salena S; Ito, Takeshi; Malamy, Michael H; Basler, Marek; Barquera, Blanca; Comstock, Laurie E",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,283,20

In the current study, we explored its downstream regulation in luminal A/B breast tumors. Materials and Methods: Bioinformatic prediction was performed using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)-breast cancer (BRCA). Cellular and molecular studies were conducted using luminal A/B representative MCF-7 and BT-474 cell lines. Results: ENST00000355610.8 (encoding MORC4a isoform) was the dominant transcript in breast cancer. ChIP-qPCR and dual-luciferase assay confirmed two STAT3-binding sites in the MID2 promoter in both MCF-7 and BT-474 cells. Co-IP confirmed an interaction between MORC4 and STAT3. ChIP-qPCR data indicated that MORC4 inhibition led to remarkably decreased enrichment of the STAT3-binding MID2 promoter segments. MORC4 overexpression significantly elevated BCL-2 expression in MCF-7 cells and increased their resistance to adriamycin (ADM), 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), and cisplatin (DDP). MID2 inhibition largely abrogated MORC4-induced drug-resistance. However, the drug-resistant phenotype was rescued by overexpressing MID2-MT that was resistant to MID2 siRNA. Conclusion: This study revealed a novel regulatory mechanism of MORC4 on MID2 expression via STAT3-mediated transcriptional activation. This regulatory axis might confer increased chemoresistance to breast cancer cells.","Luo, Jing; Zeng, Shiyan; Tian, Chao",Onco Targets Ther,283,20

METHODS AND RESULTS: The study population includes 99 consecutive patients with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to our hospital between 4 March and 25 March 2020. Fifty-three patients with a history of cardiac disease were compared with 46 without cardiac disease. Among cardiac patients, 40% had a history of heart failure, 36% had atrial fibrillation, and 30% had coronary artery disease. Mean age was 67 ± 12 years, and 80 (81%) patients were males. No differences were found between cardiac and non-cardiac patients except for higher values of serum creatinine, N-terminal probrain natriuretic peptide, and high sensitivity troponin T in cardiac patients. During hospitalization, 26% patients died, 15% developed thrombo-embolic events, 19% had acute respiratory distress syndrome, and 6% had septic shock. Mortality was higher in patients with cardiac disease compared with the others (36% vs. 15%, log-rank P = 0.019; relative risk 2.35; 95% confidence interval 1.08-5.09). The rate of thrombo-embolic events and septic shock during the hospitalization was also higher in cardiac patients (23% vs. 6% and 11% vs. 0%, respectively).

This study is particularly interested in analyzing the role of attitudes, descriptive norms, protective behaviors toward COVID-19, travel frequency before the pandemic, and spatial and individual characteristics on activity-travel behavior changes in relation to information and communication technology (ICT) use. Data were obtained from 1062 respondents using a web-based questionnaire survey. Structural equation modeling was used to examine the complex relationships among variables. This study found that descriptive norms positively affected the frequency of travel during the COVID-19 pandemic. Teleworking and e-learning and attitudes toward COVID-19 directly affected activity-travel behavior changes. On the contrary, teleshopping did not contribute to reducing out-of-home activities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Experience of ICT influenced a decline in travel frequency and ride-hailing use. Furthermore, although personal attributes insignificantly influenced activity-travel behavior change, these attributes directly affected ICT use. Meanwhile, people living outside of Java Island had a higher travel frequency during the beginning of COVID-19 pandemic than their counterparts. Based on our findings, this study recommends that the very initial step in an emergency caused by a disaster be to massively socialize or educate people about the risk of the pandemic and to continue with a policy to minimize travel by encouraging teleworking and e-learning.

This method allows for more lenient measures in areas less prone to the virus spread. There exist methods to model the spread of the virus, by predicting the number of confirmed cases. But the proposed system focuses more on the preventive side of the solution from a geographical point of view, by predicting the areas or regions that may become hotspots for the virus in the near future. The fact that the virus can only be transmitted by being in close proximity to an already infected person, suggests that, the regions that can easily be reached from an existing hotspot, have a higher chance of becoming a new hotspot. Moreover, in smaller regions, even after strict provisions, positive cases have been found. To consider this fact, the geographic distance between the nearest hotspots can be used as a measure of likelihood of the region also becoming a hotspot. In this paper, a weighted graph of regions with the regions themselves as weighted nodes with weight of the nodes as the number of active cases and the distance as edge weights.

Although reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction testing is the reference standard method to identify patients with COVID-19 infection, chest radiography and CT play a vital role in the detection and management of these patients. Prediction models for COVID-19 imaging are rapidly being developed to support medical decision making. However, inadequate availability of a diverse annotated data set has limited the performance and generalizability of existing models. To address this unmet need, the RSNA and Society of Thoracic Radiology collaborated to develop the RSNA International COVID-19 Open Radiology Database (RICORD). This database is the first multi-institutional, multinational, expert-annotated COVID-19 imaging data set. It is made freely available to the machine learning community as a research and educational resource for COVID-19 chest imaging. Pixel-level volumetric segmentation with clinical annotations was performed by thoracic radiology subspecialists for all COVID-19-positive thoracic CT scans. The labeling schema was coordinated with other international consensus panels and COVID-19 data annotation efforts, the European Society of Medical Imaging Informatics, the American College of Radiology, and the American Association of Physicists in Medicine. Study-level COVID-19 classification labels for chest radiographs were annotated by three radiologists, with majority vote adjudication by board-certified radiologists. RICORD consists of 240 thoracic CT scans and 1000 chest radiographs contributed from four international sites. It is anticipated that RICORD will ideally lead to prediction models that can demonstrate sustained performance across populations and health care systems.","Tsai, Emily B; Simpson, Scott; Lungren, Matthew P; Hershman, Michelle; Roshkovan, Leonid; Colak, Errol; Erickson, Bradley J; Shih, George; Stein, Anouk; Kalpathy-Cramer, Jayashree; Shen, Jody; Hafez, Mona; John, Susan; Rajiah, Prabhakar; Pogatchnik, Brian P; Mongan, John; Altinmakas, Emre; Ranschaert, Erik R; Kitamura, Felipe C; Topff, Laurens; Moy, Linda; Kanne, Jeffrey P; Wu, Carol C",Radiology,283,16

Eighty Wistar rats were randomly allocated to two experimental groups. Group 1: included 40 rats, submitted to abdominal suture and treated with saline, administered IM; Group 2: consisted of 40 rats, submitted to abdominal suture and treated with sodium diclofenac in a dose of 10 mg/kg of body weight per day during 4 days. Animals of both experimental groups were followed during 21 days after the suture, being killed on the 5th, 7th, 14th and 21th postoperative day, which corresponded to M1, M2, M3 and M4 moments. Ten animals from the both experimental groups were studied in each moment, with analysis of the following parameters: clinical state, breaking strength measurements, histology and tissue collagen content of abdominal scar. Several complications were observed in rats of the sodium diclofenac group, such as dehiscence, incisional rupture, weight loss, with a significant mortality rate when compared with control rats. In this group, there were no complications. Other alterations were also observed in the sodium diclofenac group, such as decreased of breaking strength on the 7th and 14th postoperative day and decreased of collagen content on the 5th, 7th and 14th postoperative day, which returns at normal values on the 21th postoperative day. In histology, animals of the sodium diclofenac group showed a delay in the healing process, such as a significant decreased of fibrogenesis, with decreased density of collagen fibers.

The rapid spread of the disease and enforcement of public health measures has caused distress among vulnerable populations such as pregnant women. With a limited understanding of the novel, emerging infectious disease, pregnant women have sought ways to access timely and trusted health care information. The mental health status of pregnant women during this public health emergency, as well as how they responded to the situation and where and how they obtained antenatal care information, remain to be understood. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the mental health status of pregnant women during the COVID-19 epidemic in China by measuring their perceived stress, anxiety, and depression levels; explore the approaches used by them to access antenatal health care information; and determine their associations with maternal mental health status. METHODS: We conducted a web-based, cross-sectional survey to assess the mental health status of Chinese pregnant women by using the validated, Chinese version of Perceived Stress Scale, Self-Rating Anxiety Scale, and Edinburgh Depression Scale. We also collected information on the various approaches these women used to access antenatal care information during the early stage of the COVID-19 epidemic, from February 5 to 28, 2020. RESULTS: A total of 1873 pregnant women from 22 provinces or regions of China participated in the survey. The prevalence of perceived stress, anxiety, and depression among these participants was 89.1% (1668/1873; 95% CI 87.6%, 90.4%), 18.1% (339/1873; 95% CI 16.4%, 19.9%), and 45.9% (859/1873; 95% CI 43.6%, 48.1%), respectively. Hospitals' official accounts on the Chinese social media platforms WeChat and Weibo were the most popular channels among these pregnant women to obtain antenatal care information during the COVID-19 outbreak. Access to antenatal care information via the hospitals' official social media accounts was found to be associated with a significantly lower risk of perceived stress (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.46, 95% CI 0.30-0.72; P=.001), anxiety (aOR 0.53, 95% CI 0.41-0.68; P<.001), and depression (aOR 0.73, 95% CI 0.59-0.91; P=.005). Access to health care information via hospital hotlines or SMS was found to be significantly associated with a lower risk of anxiety only (OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.60-0.98; P=.04). CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 outbreak in China, pregnant women experienced high levels of perceived stress, anxiety, and depression. During such public health emergencies, mental health care services should be strengthened to reassure and support pregnant women. Specific information targeted at pregnant women, including information on how to cope in an emergency or major disease outbreak, developed and disseminated by health care institutions via social media platforms could be an effective way to mitigate mental health challenges and ensure epidemic preparedness and response in the future.","Jiang, Hong; Jin, Longmei; Qian, Xu; Xiong, Xu; La, Xuena; Chen, Weiyi; Yang, Xiaoguang; Yang, Fengyun; Zhang, Xinwen; Abudukelimu, Nazhakaiti; Li, Xingying; Xie, Zhenyu; Zhu, Xiaoling; Zhang, Xiaohua; Zhang, Lifeng; Wang, Li; Li, Lingling; Li, Mu",J Med Internet Res,283,24

Despite improved understanding of the pathophysiology, management, and the great efforts worldwide to produce effective drugs, death rates of COVID-19 patients remain unacceptably high, and effective treatment is unfortunately lacking. Pharmacological strategies aimed at modulating inflammation in COVID-19 are being evaluated worldwide. Several drug therapies targeting this excessive inflammation, such as tocilizumab, an interleukin (IL)-6 inhibitor, corticosteroids, programmed cell death protein (PD)-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibition, cytokine-adsorption devices, and intravenous immunoglobulin have been identified as potentially useful and reliable approaches to counteract the cytokine storm. However, little attention is currently paid for non-drug therapeutic strategies targeting inflammatory and immunological processes that may be useful for reducing COVID-19-induced complications and improving patient outcome. Vagus nerve stimulation attenuates inflammation both in experimental models and preliminary data in human. Modulating the activity of cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathways (CAPs) described by the group of KJ Tracey has indeed become an important target of therapeutic research strategies for inflammatory diseases and sepsis. Non-invasive transcutaneous vagal nerve stimulation (t-VNS), as a non-pharmacological adjuvant, may help reduce the burden of COVID-19 and deserve to be investigated. VNS as an adjunct therapy in COVID-19 patients should be investigated in clinical trials. Two clinical trials on this topic are currently underway (NCT04382391 and NCT04368156). The results of these trials will be informative, but additional larger studies are needed.","Azabou, E.; Bao, G.; Bounab, R.; Heming, N.; Annane, D.",Frontiers in Medicine,283,29

According to the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), our emissions are estimated to have caused 0.8 deg C-1.2 deg C of anthropogenic global warming (AGW) above pre-industrial levels. AGW is likely to reach 1.5 degrees C between 2030 and 2052 if it continues to increase at the current rate. As the climate change is driven by the release of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases (GHG) into the atmosphere, there is a broad consensus that the mitigation of climate change requires transition to low GHG emission energy sources, technologies and practices. Implementing such changes systematically from individual to community-wide scales together with the resulting cultural changes and leadership towards environmental consciousness and responsibility are crucial to mitigate the looming damage of AGW. Given planetary scientists' wide recognition of the realities of climate change, and the need for us to maintain credibility by leading by example, it is appropriate to make own professional behavior more environmentally responsible. While scientists are few in numbers, and planetary scientists far fewer, high volumes of academic travel to conferences, panels, colloquia, and research collaboration visits together with extensive use of large, energetically demanding infrastructures make the""carbon footprint""of scientists much higher than that of an average citizen. This White Paper focuses on how modifying our activities, particularly associated with academic travel, can affect the carbon footprint of the planetary science community, and it makes recommendations on how the community and the funding agencies could best participate in the cultural change required to mitigate the damage that AGW will cause.","'Cuk, Matija; Virkki, Anne K.; Kohout, Tom'avs; Lellouch, Emmanuel; Lissauer, Jack J.",,283,21

Faculties have been guided by the university as well as institution to carry on the online teaching to the medical students. As the students were not present physically so flipped class model has been implemented using the Zoom cloud app for teaching Anatomy. Aim: To explore the perception of undergraduate students of Anatomy regarding online Zoom-app based flipped class sessions and to obtain the suggestions for improvement of such classes organised during the lockdown period of COVID-19. Materials and Methods: Ten gross Anatomy topics and 10 histology slides (total 15 sessions; one session for each gross anatomy topics and five sessions covering two slides for each day) were discussed in flipped class mode. For each session the text materials were served to the students two days before. On the third day, face to face interactive classes were undertaken using the Zoom platform; for the entire 199 students of Anatomy. After completion of one month, students' perceptions were obtained by semi-structured questionnaire made with Google form. Results: Although the department has organised almost daily Zoom sessions with pre-shared study material; in flipped classroom mode, but majority of the students opined for maximum three days per week Zoom sessions instead of every day's classes. Total 92% preferred the current strategy of advanced sharing of study material instead of concurrent sharing of text. Almost 93.5% students felt the study material helpful to them, 79% students found the Zoom sessions helpful for their doubt clearance. Strikingly, 53.36% students confessed that they failed to keep up with the progress of the classes in daily mode. There was a mixed reaction for continuing such mode of teaching in the post-lockdown era. The network connectivity became a broad issue as constrain to almost all of them to participate in online discussion platform. Conclusion: As the students and teachers were new in the online mode of teaching; so students feedbacks were felt need for future planning. The students had an opinion to lessen the number of classes so that they can cope up with the study material. However, majority of them wanted to move back to their classrooms rather than remain in the online mode of learning.","Roy, Hironmoy; Ray, Kuntaia; Saha, Satyajit; Ghosai, Asis Kumar",J. Clin. Diagn.

During the same period, the Norwegian Medicines Agency received 100 reports of suspected fatal adverse reactions to the vaccine. An expert group has examined the reports and assessed the extent of a causal link between vaccination and death. MATERIAL AND METHOD: The expert group worked in two pairs, each of which examined 50 anonymised reports. Each member first examined the reports alone and classified the causality as unlikely, possible, probable, certain or unclassifiable. Each pair then discussed their results until they reached a consensus. All four experts assessed a random sample of 20 reports. The degree of agreement was assessed using weighted kappa and McNemar's test of symmetry. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 87.7 years (range 61-103 years). Among 100 reported deaths, a causal link to the vaccine was considered probable in 10 cases, possible in 26 and unlikely in 59. Five were unclassifiable. Weighted kappa was 0.40 and 0.38 in the two expert pairs, respectively. INTERPRETATION: Most nursing home patients have a short remaining life expectancy, but vaccination may, in a few cases, have accelerated a process of dying that had already begun. Nursing home patients should still be given priority for vaccination, but the benefits versus risk must be carefully weighed up for the frailest patients.","Wyller, Torgeir Bruun; Kittang, Bård Reiakvam; Ranhoff, Anette Hylen; Harg, Pernille; Myrstad, Marius",Tidsskr. nor. laegeforen.,283,20

This allows to compare two radically different scenarios, one with no travel restrictions and another in which mobility is reduced by a travel ban. Our findings indicate that i) travel restrictions might be an effective measure in the short term, however, ii) they are ineffective when it comes to completely eliminate the disease. The latter is due to the impossibility of removing the risk of seeding the disease to other regions.

Physical distancing and masking were seen as more important than using a contact tracing app. There were mixed views around willingness to take COVID-19 vaccine. Current public health messaging was perceived as conflicting. Participants felt that consistent messaging and using social media to reach younger people would be helpful.

METHODS: This retrospective study, analyzed routine epidemiologic, clinical, and laboratory data of COVID-19 critically ill patients in King Saud Medical City (KSMC), Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, between March 20, 2020 and May 31, 2020. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection was confirmed by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assays performed on nasopharyngeal swabs in all enrolled cases. Outcome measures such as 28-days mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation, and ICU length of stay were analyzed. RESULTS: Three-hundred-and-fifty-two critically ill COVID-19 patients were included in the study. Patients had a mean age of 50.63 ± 13.3 years, 87.2% were males, and 49.4% were active smokers. Upon ICU admission, 56.8% of patients were mechanically ventilated with peripheral oxygen saturation/fraction of inspired oxygen (SpO2/FiO2) ratio of 158 ± 32. No co-infections with other endemic viruses were observed. Duration of mechanical ventilation was 16 (IQR: 8-28) days; ICU length of stay was 18 (IQR: 9-29) days, and 28-day mortality was 32.1%. Multivariate regression analysis showed that old age [Odds Ratio (OR): 1.15, 95% Confidence Intervals (CI): 1.03-1.21], active smoking [OR: 3, 95% CI: 2.51-3.66], pulmonary embolism [OR: 2.91, 95% CI: 2.65-3.36), decreased SpO2/FiO2 ratio [OR: 0.94, 95% CI: 0.91-0.97], and increased lactate [OR: 3.9, 95% CI: 2.4-4.9], and D-dimers [OR: 2.54, 95% CI: 1.57-3.12] were mortality predictors. CONCLUSION: Old age, active smoking, pulmonary embolism, decreased SpO2/FiO2 ratio, and increased lactate and D-dimers were predictors of 28-day mortality in critically ill COVID-19 patients.","Alharthy, Abdulrahman; Aletreby, Waleed; Faqihi, Fahad; Balhamar, Abdullah; Alaklobi, Feisal; Alanezi, Khaled; Jaganathan, Parameaswari; Tamim, Hani; Alqahtani, Saleh A; Karakitsos, Dimitrios; Memish, Ziad A",Journal of epidemiology and global health (Online),283,16

We hypothesized that hospitalized COVID-19 patients with encephalopathy have worse COVID-19 related outcomes. Methods: We used TriNetX, with a large COVID-19 database, collecting real-time electronic medical records data. We included hospitalized COVID-19 patients since January 20, 2020 who had encephalopathy based on ICD-10 coding. We examined clinical outcomes comprising need for critical care services, intubation and mortality among these patients and compared it with patients without encephalopathy before and after propensity-score matching. Results: Of 12,601 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, 1092 (8.7%) developed acute encephalopathy. Patients in the acute encephalopathy group were older (67 vs. 61 years) and had higher prevalence of medical co-morbidities including obesity, hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, COPD, chronic kidney and liver disease among others. Before and after propensity score-matching for co-morbidities, patients with acute encephalopathy were more likely to need critical care services (35.6% vs. 16.9%, p < 0.0001), intubation (19.5% vs. 6.0%, p<0.0001) and had higher 30-day mortality (24.3% vs. 17.9%, p 0.0002). Conclusion: Among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, acute encephalopathy is common and more likely to occur in patients with medical co-morbidities and are more likely to need critical care, intubation and have higher 30-day mortality even after adjusting for age and underlying medical co-morbidities.","Shah, Vishank Arun; Nalleballe, Krishna; Zaghlouleh, Ezzat; Onteddu, Sanjeeva",Brain Behav Immun Health,283,1

However, the risk of cardiotoxic effects tends to limit their use. In this review, the effects of these drugs on the electrical and mechanical activities of the heart as well as on remodelling of cardiac tissue are presented and the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms are discussed. The drugs can have proarrhythmic as well as antiarrhythmic actions resulting from their inhibition of ion channels, including voltage-dependent Na+ and Ca2+ channels, background and voltage-dependent K+ channels, and pacemaker channels. The drugs also exert a vagolytic effect due at least in part to a muscarinic receptor antagonist action. They also interfere with normal autophagy flux, an effect that could aggravate ischaemia/reperfusion injury or post-infarct remodelling. Most of the toxic effects occur at high concentrations, following prolonged drug administration or in the context of drug associations.","Mubagwa, Kanigula",Int J Antimicrob Agents,283,24

It is a hypothetical gene, which was speculated to encode a 38 aa protein. This hypothetical protein does not share sequence similarity with any other known protein and cannot be associated with a function. While the role of this ORF10 was proposed, there is growing evidence showing that the ORF10 is not a coding region. Here, we identified SARS-CoV-2 variants in which the ORF10 gene was prematurely terminated. The disease was not attenuated, and the transmissibility between humans was maintained. Also, in vitro, the strains replicated similarly to the related viruses with the intact ORF10. Altogether, based on clinical observation and laboratory analyses, it appears that the ORF10 protein is not essential in humans. This observation further proves that the ORF10 should not be treated as the protein-coding gene, and the genome annotations should be amended.","Pancer, Katarzyna; Milewska, Aleksandra; Owczarek, Katarzyna; Dabrowska, Agnieszka; Kowalski, Michal; Labaj, Pawel; Branicki, Wojciech; Sanak, Marek; Pyrc, Krzysztof",PLoS Pathog,283,33

Like for HIV, lymphopenia and drastic reduction of CD4+ T cell counts in COVID-19 patients have been linked with poor clinical outcome. As CD4+ T cells play a critical role in orchestrating responses against viral infections, important lessons can be drawn by comparing T cell response in COVID-19 and in HIV infection and by studying HIV-infected patients who became infected by SARS-CoV-2. We critically reviewed host characteristics and hyper-inflammatory response in these two viral infections to have a better insight on the large difference in clinical outcome in persons being infected by SARS-CoV-2.

Ensuring realistic conditions for music performance, however, constitutes a significant engineering challenge due to extremely strict requirements in terms of audio quality and, most importantly, network delay. To minimize the end-to-end delay experienced by the musicians, typical implementations of NMP applications use un-compressed, bidirectional audio streams and leverage UDP as transport protocol. Being connection less and unreliable,audio packets transmitted via UDP which become lost in transit are not re-transmitted and thus cause glitches in the receiver audio playout. This article describes a technique for predicting lost packet content in real-time using a deep learning approach. The ability of concealing errors in real time can help mitigate audio impairments caused by packet losses, thus improving the quality of audio playout in real-world scenarios.","Verma, Prateek; Mezza, Alessandro Ilic; Chafe, Chris; Rottondi, Cristina",,283,19

Precautionary behavior practices and psychological characteristics of confirmed and quarantined persons were investigated for planning pandemic recovery and preparedness. METHODS: this study was conducted with 1716 confirmed patients and quarantined persons in Daegu and Busan, regions where a high number of cases were confirmed during the early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak in South Korea. We collected online survey data from 23 April to 20 May 2020, in Daegu, and 28 April to 27 May 2020, in Busan, in cooperation with Daegu and Busan Infectious Disease Control Centers and public health centers in the regions. COVID-19 symptoms, pre-cautionary behavior practices, psychological states, and the need for improvement in isolation/quarantine environments were examined using an online survey. RESULTS: compared to patients infected with coronavirus, quarantined persons engaged in more hygiene-related behaviors (e.g., hand washing, cough etiquette, and proper mask-wearing) and social distancing. COVID-19 patients had a strong fear of stigma, while quarantined persons had a strong fear of contracting COVID-19. Study participants responded that it was necessary to provide financial support and adequate information during isolation/quarantine. CONCLUSIONS: the study highlights the importance of precautionary behavior to prevent COVID-19 infection and the need to provide support (both psychological and financial) to patients and quarantined persons, to reinforce effective communication, social solidarity, and public health emergency preparedness (PHEP) in a pandemic situation.","Lee, Yubin; Kim, Byung-Woo; Kim, Shin-Woo; Son, Hyunjin; Park, Boyoung; Lee, Heeyoung; You, Myoungsoon; Ki, Moran",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),283,1

The wards sampled were the Medium Secure Unit, Low Secure Unit, Hospital Based Rehabilitation Wards and Specialist Autism Inpatient Service. Records of all inpatients between January 2019 and July 2020 were examined for 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] level, ward area, supplementation status, test seasonality, medication, and health status.We performed a correlation to see whether there was an association between vitamin D level and length of time on treatment. In addition, comparison of the replete and inadequate group for age, ethnicity, seasonality, ward location and psychotropic medication was undertaken.Data on physical health risk factors, obesity and COVID-19 infection were also collected. The physical comorbidities were described in order to evaluate whether any emerging patterns relating to COVID-19 infection were emerging.ResultThere were 67 inpatients in Northgate IDD services on 1 January 2019, with 11 further patients admitted up to the end of the sampling period on 31 July 2020. Nineteen patients were discharged during that period, so the sample comprised 78 patients.Ages were comparable across three of the ward areas, except for an older group of patients in the hospital-based rehabilitation setting. Mean 25(OH)D level for supplemented (800IU/day) patients was 75nmol/l (SD 20) compared to 40nmol/l (SD 19) in the non-supplemented group (p &lt; 0.001).Thirty-eight percent of those who were inpatients during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic developed symptoms, but the small sample size could not establish vitamin D levels as a predictor of outcome.ConclusionOur findings show that clinicians continue to offer vitamin D supplementation for inpatients, at a dose of 800IU (20μg) per day.The mean vitamin D levels we observed were higher for those on supplements compared to our 2013 baseline data, whereas patients not on supplementation now had levels akin to those found previously. Vitamin D (800IU/day) supplementation is effective but adequacy of the nationally recommended dose of 400IU/day is unclear.

viral diseases continue to emerge and represent a serious issue to public health In the last twenty years, several viral epidemics such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002 to 2003, and H1N1 influenza in 2009, have been recorded Most recently, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012 In a timeline that reaches the present day, an epidemic of cases with unexplained low respiratory infections detected in Wuhan, the largest metropolitan area in China's Hubei province, was first reported to the WHO Country Office in China, on December 31, 2019 Published literature can trace the beginning of symptomatic individuals back to the beginning of December 2019 As they were unable to identify the causative agent, these first cases were classified as ""pneumonia of unknown etiology "" The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and local CDCs organized an intensive outbreak investigation program The etiology of this illness is now attributed to a novel virus belonging to the coronavirus (CoV) family, COVID-19 On February 11, 2020, the WHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, announced that the disease caused by this new CoV was a ""COVID-19,"" which is the acronym of ""coronavirus disease 2019"" In the past twenty years, two additional coronavirus epidemics have occurred SARS-CoV provoked a large-scale epidemic beginning in China and involving two dozen countries with approximately 8000 cases and 800 deaths, and the MERS-CoV that began in Saudi Arabia and has approximately 2,500 cases and 800 deaths and still causes as sporadic cases This new virus seems to be very contagious and has quickly spread globally In a meeting on January 30, 2020, per the International Health Regulations (IHR, 2005), the outbreak was declared by the WHO a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) as it had spread to 18 countries with four countries reporting human-to-human transmission An additional landmark occurred on February 26, 2020, as the first case of the disease, not imported from China, was recorded in the United States Initially, the new virus was called 2019-nCoV Subsequently, the task of experts of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) termed it the SARS-CoV-2 virus as it is very similar to the one that caused the SARS outbreak (SARS-CoVs) The CoVs have become the major pathogens of emerging respiratory disease outbreaks They are a large family of single-stranded RNA viruses (+ssRNA) that can be isolated in different animal species For reasons yet to be explained, these viruses can cross species barriers and can cause, in humans, illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as MERS and SARS Interestingly, these latter viruses have probably originated from bats and then moving into other mammalian hosts — the Himalayan palm civet for SARS-CoV, and the dromedary camel for MERS-CoV — before jumping to humans The dynamics of SARS-Cov-2 are currently unknown, but there is speculation that it also has an animal origin The potential for these viruses to grow to become a pandemic worldwide seems to be a serious public health risk Concerning COVID-19, the WHO raised the threat to the CoV epidemic to the ""very high"" level, on February 28, 2020 Probably, the effects of the epidemic caused by the new CoV has yet to emerge as the situation is quickly evolving World governments are at work to establish countermeasures to stem possible devastating effects Health organizations coordinate information flows and issues directives and guidelines to best mitigate the impact of the threat At the same time, scientists around the world work tirelessly, and information about the transmission mechanisms, the clinical spectrum of disease, new diagnostics, and prevention and therapeutic strategies are rapidly developing Many uncertainties remain with regard to both the virus-host interaction and the evolution of the epidemic, with specific reference to the times when the epidemic will reach its peak At the moment, the therapeutic strategies to deal with the infection are only supportive, and prevention aimed at reducing transmission in the community is our best weapon Aggressive isolation measures in China have led to a

The impact of timing of SNB on disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) is still unclear. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was conducted at 6 Italian Melanoma Intergroup (IMI) centres and included 8953 consecutive clinical stage I-II melanoma patients who were diagnosed, treated, and followed up between November 1997 and March 2018. All patients were prospectively included in dedicated IMI database. Multivariable Cox regression analyses were performed to investigate how baseline characteristics and time interval until SNB are related to DFS and OS. RESULTS: Considering the whole population, at multivariable analysis, after adjusting for age, gender, Breslow thickness, site, ulceration, and the SNB status, a delay in the timing of SNB was associated with a better DFS (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR, delayed versus early SNB] 0.98, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.97-0.99, p < 0.001) and OS (aHR 0.98, 95% CI 0.97-0.99, p = 0.001). Specifically, in patients with a negative SNB status, a beneficial impact of delayed SNB (i.e. at least 32 days after primary excision) was confirmed for DFS (aHR 0.70, 95%CI 0.63-0.79, p < 0.001) and OS (aHR 0.69, 95%CI 0.61-0.78, p < 0.001), whereas in those with a positive SNB status, DFS (aHR 0.96, 95%CI 0.84-1.09, p = 0.534) and OS (aHR 0.94 95%CI 0.81-1.08, p = 0.374) were not significantly different in patients with early or delayed SNB. CONCLUSIONS: Our study does not support a strict time interval for SNB. These results may be useful for national guidelines, for counselling patients and reducing the number of high urgency referrals.","Mandalà, Mario; Galli, Francesca; Patuzzo, Roberto; Maurichi, Andrea; Mocellin, Simone; Rossi, Carlo R; Rulli, Eliana; Montesco, Maria; Quaglino, Pietro; Caliendo, Virginia; De Giorgi, Vincenzo; Merelli, Barbara; Caracò, Corrado; Piazzalunga, Dario; Labianca, Alice; Ribero, Simone; Senetta, Rebecca; Gianatti, Andrea; Valeri, Barbara; Massi, Daniela; Ascierto, Paolo A; Santinami, Mario",Eur J Cancer,283,16

This study aimed to explore the links between contextual variables related to the COVID-19 pandemic and disease and psychological outcomes. METHODS: The sample included 124 Portuguese patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis (85.48% women) who completed self-reported measures in an online survey during April 2020. RESULTS: Fear of contracting COVID-19 and medication adherence were both high and unrelated. About half of the sample presented moderate (37.10%) to severe (14.50%) anxiety. Normal and mild anxiety levels were at 29.80% and 18.50%, respectively. Regarding depressive symptoms, 51.60% of the sample presented normal levels, 27.40% mild severity, 16.10% moderate, and 4.8% severe. No differences were found between Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis patients. Regression analyses showed that anxiety explained IBD symptom perception (ß = 0.29; P = 0.022); fear of contracting COVID-19 (ß = 0.35; P < 0.001) and IBD symptom perception (ß = -0.22; P = 0.009) explained depressive symptoms; and fear of contracting COVID-19 (ß = 0.41; P < 0.001), IBD symptom perception (ß = 0.26, P < 0.001), and being in isolation (ß = -0.16, P = 0.041) explained anxiety.

Their non-metalized gate dielectrics that are exposed to an electrolyte solution cover the semiconductor material and actively transduce the biological changes on the surface. The efficiency of these novel devices in detecting different biomolecular analytes in a real-time, highly precise, specific, and label-free manner has been validated by numerous research studies. Considerable progress has been attained in designing FET devices, especially for biomedical diagnosis and cell-based assays in the past few decades. The exceptional electronic properties, compactness, and scalability of these novel tools are very desirable for designing rapid, label-free, and mass detection of biomolecules. With the incorporation of nanotechnology, the performance of biosensors based on FET boosts significantly, particularly, employment of nanomaterials such as graphene, metal nanoparticles, single and multi-walled carbon nanotubes, nanorods, and nanowires. Besides, their commercial availability, and high-quality production on a large-scale, turn them to be one of the most preferred sensing and screening platforms. This review presents the basic structural setup and working principle of different types of FET devices. We also focused on the latest progression regarding the use of FET biosensors for the recognition of viruses such as, recently emerged COVID-19, Influenza, Hepatitis B Virus, protein biomarkers, nucleic acids, bacteria, cells, and various ions. Additionally, an outline of the development of FET sensors for investigations related to drug development and the cellular investigation is also presented. Some technical strategies for enhancing the sensitivity and selectivity of detection in these devices are addressed as well. However, there are still certain challenges which are remained unaddressed concerning the performance and clinical use of transistor-based point-of-care (POC) instruments; accordingly, expectations about their future improvement for biosensing and cellular studies are argued at the end of this review.","Sadighbayan, Deniz; Hasanzadeh, Mohammad; Ghafar-Zadeh, Ebrahim",Trends Analyt Chem,283,31

A literature search retrieved eligible studies in PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and Web of Science up to June 1, 2020. A comprehensive review of publications of the Chinese Medical Association about COVID-19 was also performed. A total of 84 articles with more than 5340 participants were included and reviewed. Chest CT comprised 92.61% of abnormal CT findings overall. Compared with real-time polymerase chain reaction result, CT findings has a sensitivity of 96.14% but a low specificity of 40.48% in diagnosing COVID-19. Ground glass opacity (GGO), pure (57.31%) or mixed with consolidation (41.51%) were the most common CT features with a majority of bilateral (80.32%) and peripheral (66.21%) lung involvement. The opacity might associate with other imaging features, including air bronchogram (41.07%), vascular enlargement (54.33%), bronchial wall thickening (19.12%), crazy-paving pattern (27.55%), interlobular septal thickening (42.48%), halo sign (25.48%), reverse halo sign (12.29%), bronchiectasis (32.44%), and pulmonary fibrosis (26.22%). Other accompanying signs including pleural effusion, lymphadenopathy and pericardial effusion were rare, but pleural thickening was common. The younger or early stage patients tended to have more GGOs, while extensive/multilobar involvement with consolidation was prevalent in the older or severe population. Children with COVID-19 showed significantly lower incidences of some ancillary findings than those of adults and showed a better performance on CT during follow up. Follow-up CT showed GGO lesions gradually decreased, and the consolidation lesions first increased and then remained relatively stable at 6-13 days, and then absorbed and fibrosis increased after 14 days.

We performed a prospective study to investigate seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among staff and patients with cancer at a large cancer centre, at the end of the period of first national lockdown in France and to determine factors associated with the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: After the first lockdown, all medical and non-medical staff, as well as all patients attending the medical oncology department were invited to undergo serological testing for SARS-CoV-2 between 11 May and 30 June 2020. All participants were also invited to complete a questionnaire collecting data about their living and working conditions, and for patients, medical management during lockdown. FINDINGS: A total of 1,674 subjects (663 staff members, 1011 patients) were included. Seroprevalence was low in both staff (1.8%) and patients (1.7%), despite more features of high risk for severe forms among patients. None of the risk factors tested in our analysis (working or living conditions, comorbidities, management characteristics during lockdown) was found to be statistically associated with seroprevalence in either staff or patients. There was no significant difference in the proportion of symptomatic and asymptomatic subjects between staff and patients. Only fever, loss of smell, and loss of taste were significantly more frequent among seropositive patients, in both staff and patients. INTERPRETATION: We report very low seroprevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in the staff (caregiving and non-caregiving) and patients of a large cancer care centre in which strict hygiene, personal protection, and social distancing measures were implemented.","Ladoire, Sylvain; Goussot, Vincent; Redersdorff, Emilie; Cueff, Adele; Ballot, Elise; Truntzer, Caroline; Ayati, Siavoshe; Bengrine-Lefevre, Leila; Bremaud, Nathalie; Coudert, Bruno; Desmoulins, Isabelle; Favier, Laure; Fraisse, Cléa; Fumet, Jean-David; Hanu, Roxana; Hennequin, Audrey; Hervieu, Alice; Ilie, Silvia; Kaderbhai, Courèche; Lagrange, Aurélie; Martin, Nils; Mazilu, Irina; Mayeur, Didier; Palmier, Rémi; Simonet-Lamm, Anne-Laure; Vincent, Julie; Zanetta, Sylvie; Arnould, Laurent; Coutant, Charles; Bertaut, Aurélie; Ghiringhelli, François",Eur J Cancer,283,21

Social isolation can expose older adults to an increased nutritional risk due to factors such as socioeconomic insecurity, which could affect food acquisition and the need for support in daily tasks and meals. The institutionalized older adults often depend on food donations, which may have reduced due the economic crisis caused by the pandemic, and the aging process itself causes changes in nutritional necessitie and eating habits. In the coronavirus pandemic, nutritionists and dietitians can offer remote nutritional follow-up. Moreover, the government actions, such as the implementation of educational and social service programs, should be applied to support healthy aging and minimize exposure to nutritional risks and coronavirus disease.","Ceolin, Gilciane; Moreira, Júlia Dubois; Mendes, Bruna Cunha; Schroeder, Jaqueline; Pietro, Patricia Faria Di; Rieger, Debora Kurrle",Rev.

The more recent use of several human adenoviruses as oncolytic agents has exhibited excellent safety profiles and firm evidence of clinical efficacy. This proffers the question whether NHP-derived adenoviruses could also be employed for viral oncolysis in human patients. While vaccine vectors are conventionally made as replication-defective vectors, in oncolytic applications replication-competent viruses are used. The data on NHP-derived adenoviral vectors obtained from vaccination studies can only partially support the suitability of NHP-derived adenoviruses for use in oncolytic virus therapy. In addition, the use of NHP-derived adenoviruses in humans might be received warily given the recent zoonotic infections with influenza viruses and coronaviruses. In this review, we discuss the similarities and differences between human- and NHP-derived adenoviruses in view of their use as oncolytic agents. These include their genome organization, receptor use, replication and cell lysis, modulation of the host's immune responses, as well as their pathogenicity in humans. Together, the data should facilitate a rational and data-supported decision on the suitability of NHP-derived adenoviruses for prospective use in oncolytic virus therapy.","Bots, Selas T F; Hoeben, Rob C",,283,23

Because of its rapid spread worldwide, it may influence the prognosis of other medical conditions, such as ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). We report a case of a 58-year female patient admitted with an infero-posterior STEMI on the background of recently positive COVID-19 swab. Reperfusion was attempted through primary PCI but unfortunately failed to restore coronary blood flow due to massive thrombotic burden despite several attempts of balloon dilatation and aspiration thrombectomy. She sadly died later on because of hemodynamic deterioration. This scenario raises concerns about Neutrophil Extracellular Traps (NETS) which might potentially have propagated inflammation and thrombosis via platelets' aggregation leading to enhanced coagulopathy and massive coronary thrombosis. Therefore, we suggest primary PCI as the first-choice of revascularization in patients with combined COVID-19 and STEMI. Additionally, we emphasize on the importance of using the potent new generation P2Y12 inhibitors along with GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors in every STEMI patient with COVID-19 to achieve favorable conditions for primary PCI as well as favorable outcomes after stent implantation.","Seif, Sherif; Ayuna, Ahmed; Kumar, Abhishek; Macdonald, John",Catheter. cardiovasc. interv,283,26

Aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of anticoagulation in coronavirus disease 2019 hospitalized patients and its impact on survival. DESIGN: Multicenter international prospective registry (Health Outcome Predictive Evaluation for Corona Virus Disease 2019). SETTING: Hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019. PATIENTS: Five thousand eight hundred thirty-eight consecutive coronavirus disease 2019 patients. INTERVENTIONS: Anticoagulation therapy, including prophylactic and therapeutic regimens, was obtained for each patient. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Five thousand four hundred eighty patients (94%) did not receive any anticoagulation before hospitalization. Two-thousand six-hundred one patients (44%) during hospitalization received anticoagulation therapy and it was not associated with better survival rate (81% vs 81%; p = 0.94) but with higher risk of bleeding (2.7% vs 1.8%; p = 0.03). Among patients admitted with respiratory failure (49%, n = 2,859, including 391 and 583 patients requiring invasive and noninvasive ventilation, respectively), anticoagulation started during hospitalization was associated with lower mortality rates (32% vs 42%; p < 0.01) and nonsignificant higher risk of bleeding (3.4% vs 2.7%; p = 0.3). Anticoagulation therapy was associated with lower mortality rates in patients treated with invasive ventilation (53% vs 64%; p = 0.05) without increased rates of bleeding (9% vs 8%; p = 0.88) but not in those with noninvasive ventilation (35% vs 38%; p = 0.40). At multivariate Cox' analysis mortality relative risk with anticoagulation was 0.58 (95% CI, 0.49-0.67) in patients admitted with respiratory failure, 0.50 (95% CI, 0.49-0.67) in those requiring invasive ventilation, 0.72 (95% CI, 0.51-1.01) in noninvasive ventilation.

Recently, investigators have stipulated that COVID-19 patients receiving angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) may be subject to poorer outcomes. This editorial presents the available evidence to guide treatment practices during this pandemic. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies from Wuhan cohorts provide valuable information about COVID-19. A cohort with 52 critically ill patients revealed cardiac injury in 12% of patients. Worse outcomes appear to be more prevalent in patients with hypertension and diabetes mellitus (DM), possibly due to overexpression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor in airway alveolar epithelial cells. Investigators suspect that SARS-CoV-2 uses the ACE2 receptor to enter the lungs in a mechanism similar to SARS-CoV. Several hypotheses have been proposed to date regarding the net effect of ACEI/ARB on COVID-19 infections. Positive effects include ACE2 receptor blockade, disabling viral entry into the heart and lungs, and an overall decrease in inflammation secondary to ACEI/ARB. Negative effects include a possible retrograde feedback mechanism, by which ACE2 receptors are upregulated. Even though physiological models of SARS-CoV infection show a theoretical benefit of ACEI/ARB, these findings cannot be extrapolated to SARS-CoV-2 causing COVID-19. Major cardiology scientific associations, including ACC, HFSA, AHA, and ESC Hypertension Council, have rejected these correlation hypotheses. After an extensive literature review, we conclude that there is no significant evidence to support an association for now, but given the rapid evolvement of this pandemic, findings may change.","Rico-Mesa, Juan Simon; White, Averi; Anderson, Allen S",Curr Cardiol Rep,283,4

Among 108 follow-up specimens from confirmed COVID-19 patients who tested negative by the non-nested COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay, 28 (25.9%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 by the STN COVID-19-RdRp/Hel or the STN COVID-19-N assay. To evaluate the performance of our novel STN assays in pooled specimens, we created four sample pools, with each pool consisting of one low positive specimen and 49 negative specimens. While the non-nested COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay was positive in only one of four sample pools (25%), both of the STN assays were positive in two of four samples pools (50%). In conclusion, the STN assays are highly sensitive and specific for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Their boosted sensitivity offers advantages in non-traditional COVID-19 testing algorithms such as saliva screening and pooled sample screening during massive screening.","Yip, Cyril Chik-Yan; Sridhar, Siddharth; Leung, Kit-Hang; Ng, Anthony Chin-Ki; Chan, Kwok-Hung; Chan, Jasper Fuk-Woo; Tsang, Owen Tak-Yin; Hung, Ivan Fan-Ngai; Cheng, Vincent Chi-Chung; Yuen, Kwok-Yung; To, Kelvin Kai-Wang",,283,24

Patients presenting with acute respiratory tract infections (RTI) are often started empirically on antibiotics and continued for days, unless confirmatory results are reported by microbiological testing. Procalcitonin is a serum inflammatory marker that increases in bacterial infections and is utilized as an adjunct to help differentiate viral versus bacterial pneumonia. Procalcitonin-guided management is associated with significantly lower antibiotic exposure and mortality. No studies exist in literature that assess the appropriate utilization of negative procalcitonin test for antibiotic discontinuation. This study assesses utilization of a negative PCT (&lt;0.25 ng/ml) to guide antibiotic discontinuation in patients with pneumonia in a community hospital. Methods:Retrospective observational study including adult patients admitted to our community hospital in 1 year (July 2019-June 2020) with diagnosis of community acquired pneumonia and started on empiric antibiotic therapy and had procalcitonin levels checked. Our hypothesis was that PCT is not being appropriately used for discontinuation of antibiotics and that rate of discontinuation of antibiotics will be less despite a negative PCT. Statistical analysis was performed using XLSTAT. Categorical variables were represented by frequencies and proportions and compared using Chi-square and z test for two proportions. Results: 516 charts were reviewed. After excluding missing data, 176 patients were included. 100 patients had negative PCT. Antibiotics were discontinued in 16% of patients with negative PCT, compared to 58% (p&lt;0.0001), in whom antibiotics were continued without any other indication (including UTI, severe COPD exacerbation, COVID pneumonia) despite a negative PCT. The difference between the percentage of antibiotic discontinuation in our PCT guided treatment sample (9%, n=16/176) was also found to be statistically significant (p&lt; 0.001) compared to percentage of antibiotic discontinuation in population using data from a meta-analysis of 7 RCTs (42%, n=698/1658).1 Conclusion:Previous studies have shown that procalcitonin guided treatment aids in decreasing antibiotic exposure. In lower respiratory tract infections, clinicians order PCT test to aid in differentiating viral versus bacterial etiology and ultimately help guide antibiotic therapy. Our data analysis reveals that despite negative PCT, thus indicating a likely viral etiology, clinicians are not consistently making changes to empiric antibiotic use. This study addresses need for further recommendations from antibiotic stewardship programs regarding procalcitonin-guided antibiotic use and prevent unnecessary ordering of PCT test.","Goel, M.; Aggarwal, A.; Chawla, R.; Khan, A.; Jerome, A.; Al-Haschemy, M.; Bidhan, S.; Kumar, S.; Tegeltija, V.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,283,26

Italy was the first country to be exposed to SARS-CoV-2 in Europe. One of the measures adopted by the Italian government during COVID-19 pandemic was the total lockdown of the cities with complete confinement at home. We aimed to examine the impact of the lockdown caused by COVID-19 pandemic on exclusive breastfeeding in non-infected mothers. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 204 mother-baby dyads during lockdown (9 March to 8 May 2020) that we compared to previously studied 306 mother-baby dyads admitted during the year 2018. To reduce the possible effect of confounding factors on exclusive breastfeeding, a 1:1 matching was performed by using an automatized procedure of stratification that paired 173 mother-baby dyads. Feeding modality was collected at discharge, 30 and 90 days of newborn's life. Exclusive breastfeeding was considered when the infant received only breast milk and no other liquids or solids were given with the exception of vitamins, minerals or medicines. RESULTS: At discharge 69.4% of infants were exclusively breastfed during lockdown versus 97.7% of control group, 54.3% at 30 days vs 76.3 and 31.8% vs 70.5% at 90 days (p < 0.001). The proportion of breastfeeding remaining exclusive from discharge to 30-day was similar between groups (about 80%), but it was lower in lockdown group than in control cohort (58.5% vs 92.4%, p < 0.001) from 30- to 90-days. CONCLUSIONS: Lockdown and home confinement led to a decrease of exclusively breastfeeding in the studied population. Considering the timing to shift from exclusive to non-exclusive breastfeeding, differences between study groups were concentrated during hospital stay and from 30- to 90 days of a newborn's life, confirming that the hospital stay period is crucial in continuing exclusive breastfeeding at least for the first 30 days, but no longer relevant at 90 days of life.","Latorre, Giuseppe; Martinelli, Domenico; Guida, Pietro; Masi, Ester; De Benedictis, Roberta; Maggio, Luca",Int Breastfeed J,283,16

The aim of this observational, single-center, prospective study was to assess the association between corticosteroids and hospital mortality in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients who did not receive IMV (OSCI 3-5). Included were 1,311 COVID-19 patients admitted to nonintensive care wards, and they were divided in two cohorts: (i) 480 patients who received corticosteroid therapy and (ii) 831 patients who did not. The median daily dose was of 8 mg of dexamethasone or equivalent, with a mean therapy duration of 5 (3-9) days. The indication to administer or withhold corticosteroids was given by the treating physician. In-hospital mortality was similar between the two cohorts after adjusting for possible confounders (adjusted odds ratio (ORadj) 1.04, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.81-1.34, P = 0.74). There was also no difference in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission (ORadj 0.81, 95% CI, 0.56-1.17, P = 0.26). COVID-19 patients with noninvasive mechanical ventilation (NIMV) had a lower risk for ICU admission if they received steroid therapy (ORadj 0.58, 95% CI, 0.35-0.94, P = 0.03). In conclusion, corticosteroids were overall not associated with a difference in hospital mortality for patients with COVID-19 with OSCI 3-5. In the subgroup of patients with NIMV (OSCI 5), corticosteroids reduced ICU admission, whereas the effect on mortality requires further studies.","Fusina, Federica; Albani, Filippo; Granato, Enza; Meloni, Angelo; Rozzini, Renzo; Sabatini, Tony; Stellini, Roberto; Terragnoli, Paolo; Rosano, Antonio; Abu Hilal, Mohammed; Natalini, Giuseppe",Clin Pharmacol Ther,283,16

It is an immediate priority to develop and test a computer-aided detection (CAD) scheme based on deep learning (DL) to automatically localize and differentiate COVID-19 from community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) on chest X-rays. Therefore, this study aims to develop and test an efficient and accurate deep learning scheme that assists radiologists in automatically recognizing and localizing COVID-19. A retrospective chest X-ray image dataset was collected from open image data and the Xiangya Hospital, which was divided into a training group and a testing group. The proposed CAD framework is composed of two steps with DLs: the Discrimination-DL and the Localization-DL. The first DL was developed to extract lung features from chest X-ray radiographs for COVID-19 discrimination and trained using 3548 chest X-ray radiographs. The second DL was trained with 406-pixel patches and applied to the recognized X-ray radiographs to localize and assign them into the left lung, right lung or bipulmonary. X-ray radiographs of CAP and healthy controls were enrolled to evaluate the robustness of the model. Compared to the radiologists' discrimination and localization results, the accuracy of COVID-19 discrimination using the Discrimination-DL yielded 98.71%, while the accuracy of localization using the Localization-DL was 93.03%. This work represents the feasibility of using a novel deep learning-based CAD scheme to efficiently and accurately distinguish COVID-19 from CAP and detect localization with high accuracy and agreement with radiologists.","Wang, Zheng; Xiao, Ying; Li, Yong; Zhang, Jie; Lu, Fanggen; Hou, Muzhou; Liu, Xiaowei",Pattern Recognit,283,24

The median score for overall efficacy, PRE, and PSE were 79.8, 87.5, and 80.0, respectively. However, the median value (66.7) for PCE was relatively low. Perceived threat significantly varied by age, education, occupation, and place of residence (p < 0.05). Perceived efficacy significantly differed by gender, residence, and use of some sources of information (p < 0.05). In terms of response to COVID-19, 290 (31.2%), 239 (25.7%), 175 (18.8%) and 225 (24.2%) of the respondents were in the responsive, pro-active, avoidant, and indifferent attitudinal categories, respectively. The avoidant and indifferent groups constituted a fear control response (mal-adaptive motivation towards COVID-19 protective behavior) whereas responsive and pro-active categories formed a danger control response (self-protective motivation). These responses varied significantly by residence, region, religion, and sources of information (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Understanding people's perceived health threat and efficacy is a critical step toward creating risk communication campaigns. Hence, this study provided an insight that has the potential to inform the COVID-19 risk communication campaigns targeting the educated section of the society, by ensuring a balanced combination of threat appeals and efficacy messages for improved self-protective responses.","Birhanu, Zewdie; Ambelu, Argaw; Fufa, Diriba; Mecha, Mohammed; Zeynudin, Ahmed; Abafita, Jemal; Belay, Ashenafi; Doyore, Feleke; Oljira, Lemessa; Bacha, Endale; Feyisa, Jilcha; Hadis, Zinabu; Ayele, Ketema; Addisu, Yohannes; Gutu, Birhanu; Tesfaye, Demu; Tilahun, Temesgen; Imana, Gudeta; Tolosa, Tadele; Mekonen, Seblework; Yitayih, Yimenu; Jibat, Nega; Moges, Mathewos; Adamu, Ayinengida; Teym, Abraham; Kenea, Adamu; Addis, Taffere; Mengesha, Akalework; Kebede, Yohannes",BMC Public Health,283,1

In this paper, we use a differential equation model to describe the propagation of COVID-19, and discuss the effects of intensity of hospital isolation and moment of taking measures on development of the epidemic. The results show that isolation measures can significantly reduce the epidemic final size and the number of dead, and the greater the intensity of measures, the better, but duration of the epidemic will be prolonged. Whenever isolation measures are taken, the epidemic final size and the number of dead can be reduced. In early stage of the epidemic, taking measures one day later has little impact, but after a certain period, if taking measures one day later, the epidemic final size and the number of dead increase sharply. Taking measures as early as possible makes the maximum number of patients appear later, which is conducive to expanding medical bed resources and reducing the pressure on medical resource demand. As long as possible, high-intensity isolation measures should be taken in time for patients with mild symptoms.","Pan, Qiuhui; Gao, Ting; He, Mingfeng",Chaos Solitons Fractals,283,16

Results: As a product of this research, we present two networks, one from the interactions virus-host, and the other restricted to host-host, the last one is not usually considered for network analysis. We identified the most important proteins in both networks, those that have the maximal value of calculated invariants, these proteins are considered as the most: affected, connected or those that best monitor the flow of information in the network, among them we find UBC, a human protein related with ubiquination, linked with different stages of coronavirus disease, and ORF7A a virus protein that induces apoptosis in infected cells, associated with virion tethering. Using the constructed networks, we establish the more significant diseases corresponding with human proteins and their connections with other proteins. It is relevant that the identified diseases coincide with comorbidities, particularly the subnetwork of diabetes involves a great quantity of virus and human proteins (56%) and interactions (60%), this could explain the effect of this condition as an important cause of disease complications.","Luna, Beatriz; Ram'irez, Marcelino; Gal'an, Edgardo",,283,1

Multiplex immunoblot (IB) assays termed COVID-19 IB assays were developed for detecting IgG and IgM antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 virus proteins in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Recombinant nucleocapsid protein and the S1, S2 and receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 were used as target antigens in the COVID-19 IBs. Specificity of the IB assay was established with 231 sera from persons with allergy, unrelated viral infections, autoimmune conditions and suspected tick-borne diseases, and 32 goat antisera to human influenza proteins. IgG and IgM COVID-19 IBs assays were performed on 84 sera obtained at different times after a positive RT-qPCR test from 37 COVID-19 patients with mild symptoms. RESULTS: Criteria for determining overall IgG and IgM antibody positivity using the four SARS-CoV-2 proteins were developed by optimizing specificity and sensitivity in the COVID-19 IgG and IgM IB assays. The estimated sensitivities and specificities of the COVID-19 IgG and IgM IBs for IgG and IgM antibodies individually or for either IgG or IgM antibodies meet the US recommendations for laboratory serological diagnostic tests. The proportion of IgM-positive sera from the COVID-19 patients following an RT-qPCR positive test was maximal at 83% before 10 days and decreased to 0% after 100 days, while the proportions of IgG-positive sera tended to plateau between days 11 and 65 at 78-100% and fall to 44% after 100 days. Detection of either IgG or IgM antibodies was better than IgG or IgM alone for assessing seroconversion in COVID-19. Both IgG and IgM antibodies detected RBD less frequently than S1, S2 and N proteins. CONCLUSIONS: The multiplex COVID-19 IB assays offer many advantages for simultaneously evaluating antibody responses to different SARS-CoV-2 proteins in COVID-19 patients.","Shah, Jyotsna; Liu, Song; Potula, Hari-Hara; Bhargava, Prerna; Cruz, Iris; Force, Denise; Bazerbashi, Ammar; Ramasamy, Ranjan",BMC Infect Dis,283,1

This study examines medication use and anticholinergic burden (ACB) among a cohort of older Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island people. METHOD: This cross-sectional study involving five Aboriginal communities (two in metropolitan Sydney and three on the mid-north coast of New South Wales) used a structured interview process to assess cognition, depression, and activities of daily living for a cohort of older adults (aged 60 years and over). Participants also reported on their health status, medical history, and prescription medications during the interview. ACB was calculated, and its association with adverse health outcomes including cognitive impairment, falls, hospitalization, and depressive symptoms were examined. RESULTS: Most participants (95%) were taking at least one regular medication with polypharmacy (&#8805;5 medications) observed in 43% of participants; 12.2% had a significant ACB (&#8805;3) with antidepressants being a major contributor. Anticholinergic medication use was associated with cognitive impairment, recent hospitalization (past 12 months), and depressive symptoms. After controlling for age, sex, and comorbidity, only the presence of depressive symptoms remained significantly associated with the use of anticholinergic medication (odds ratio 2.86; 95% confidence interval 1.48-5.51). CONCLUSIONS: Clinically significant ACB was common in older Aboriginal Australians and was largely attributable to inappropriate use of tricyclic antidepressants.

Changes in modes of instruction have presented psychosocial stressors to children and parents that can increase risks to mental health and well-being and might exacerbate educational and health disparities (1,2). CDC examined differences in child and parent experiences and indicators of well-being according to children's mode of school instruction (i.e., in-person only [in-person], virtual-only [virtual], or combined virtual and in-person [combined]) using data from the COVID Experiences nationwide survey. During October 8-November 13, 2020, parents or legal guardians (parents) of children aged 5-12 years were surveyed using the NORC at the University of Chicago AmeriSpeak panel,* a probability-based panel designed to be representative of the U.S. household population. Among 1,290 respondents with a child enrolled in public or private school, 45.7% reported that their child received virtual instruction, 30.9% in-person instruction, and 23.4% combined instruction. For 11 of 17 stress and well-being indicators concerning child mental health and physical activity and parental emotional distress, findings were worse for parents of children receiving virtual or combined instruction than were those for parents of children receiving in-person instruction. Children not receiving in-person instruction and their parents might experience increased risk for negative mental, emotional, or physical health outcomes and might need additional support to mitigate pandemic effects.

This condition with poorly understood incidence and etiology is characterized by the locoregional development of scar tissue, leading to subcutaneous cording, motion impairment and pain. The early identification of patients at risk for AWS would improve their clinical management. Here, we sought to characterize the prevalence of and the risk factors associated with AWS in BC women after surgery. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All patients with BC that underwent axillary surgery referred to an Outpatient Service for Oncological Rehabilitation were retrospectively collected. These women were assessed two weeks after the surgical procedure for their clinicopathologic features, type of therapeutic interventions, and AWS presence, laterality, pain, localization, cords type, and number of cords. RESULTS: Altogether, 177 patients (mean aged 60.65 ± 12.26 years) were included and divided into two groups: AWSPOS (n=52; 29.4%) and AWSNEG (n=125; 70.6%). Patients with tumor N &#8805;1 (OR=3.7; p<0.001), subjected to mastectomy, axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) and chemotherapy showed significant correlations with AWS onset (p<0.05). The range of shoulder motion limitation (OR=11.2; p<0.001) and the presence of breast cancer related lymphedema (OR=3.5; p=0.020) were associated with AWS. CONCLUSIONS: Mastectomy, ALND, chemotherapy, low staging tumors, shoulder range of motion limitations, and BCRL represent risk factors for AWS onset. Realizing new strategies for assessing the individual risk of AWS is a crucial clinical need to improve the health-related quality of life of BC survivors.","de Sire, A; Losco, L; Cisari, C; Gennari, A; Boldorini, R; Fusco, N; Cigna, E; Invernizzi, M",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,283,33

However, only a few Synechococcus phages have been described from the coastal seas of the Northwest Pacific Ocean. Here a new Synechococcus phage, S-B43 was isolated from the Bohai Sea, a semi-closed coastal sea of the Northwest Pacific Ocean. S-B43 is a member of Myoviridae, containing 275 predicted open reading frames. Fourteen auxiliary metabolic genes (AMG) were identified from the genome of S-B43, including five photosynthetic associated genes and several AMGs related to its adaption to the high turbidity and eutrophic coastal environment with a low ratio of phosphorus to nitrogen (HNLP). The occurrences of 31 AMGs among 34 cyanophage genomes indicates that AMGs zwf, gnd, speD, petF and those coding for FECH and thioredoxin were more common in coastal areas than in the open ocean and AMGs pebS and ho1 were more prevalent in the open ocean. The occurrence of cyanophage AMGs in different environments might be a reflection of the environmental adaption of their hosts. This study contributes to our understanding of the interactions between cyanobacteria and cyanophages and their environmental adaption to the coastal environment.","Wang, Meiwen; Gao, Chen; Jiang, Tong; You, Siyuan; Jiang, Yong; Guo, Cui; He, Hui; Liu, Yundan; Zhang, Xinran; Shao, Hongbing; Liu, Hongbin; Liang, Yantao; Wang, Min; McMinn, Andrew",Virus Res,283,24

We measured plasma hypocretin-1 levels in SCZ patients and healthy controls and found significantly decreased plasma hypocretin-1 levels in SCZ patients, which was mainly due to a significant decrease in female SCZ patients compared with female controls. In addition, we measured postmortem hypothalamic hypocretin-1-immunoreactivity (ir), ventricular cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hypocretin-1 levels, and hypocretin receptor (Hcrt-R) mRNA expression in the superior frontal gyrus (SFG) in SCZ patients and controls We observed a significant decrease in the amount of hypothalamic hypocretin-1 ir in SCZ patients, which was due to decreased amounts in female but not male patients. Moreover, Hcrt-R2 mRNA in the SFG was decreased in female SCZ patients compared with female controls, while male SCZ patients showed a trend of increased Hcrt-R1 mRNA and Hcrt-R2 mRNA expression compared with male controls.

Children have been excluded from the vaccination programmes owing to their lower vulnerability to COVID-19 and to the special protections that apply to children's exposure to new biological products. WHO guidelines and national laws focus on medical safety in the process of vaccine approval, and on national security in the process of emergency authorisation. Because children suffer much from social distancing, it is argued that the harms from containment measures should be factored in a broader perspective on the good of the child. Considering the available knowledge on the disease, vaccine, and coping strategies, the decision about vaccine access to children is a public responsibility. The ultimate choice is a matter of paediatric informed consent. Moreover, jurisdictions that permit non-participation in established childhood vaccination programmes should also permit choice of vaccines outside of the approved programmes. Even if vaccine supply is too short to cover the paediatric population, the a priori exclusion of children is unjust. It may also exacerbate local and global inequalities. The second part of the paper delineates a prudent and ethical scheme for gradual incorporation of minors in vaccination programmes that includes a rigorous postvaccination monitoring. This is a theoretical paper in ethics that uses the Pfizer vaccine as a stock example, without discussing possible differences among existing vaccines. The key purpose is reflection on the good of the child in emergencies and vaccine policymaking.","Brusa, Margherita; Barilan, Yechiel Michael",J Med Ethics,283,1

On April 2, when 19 cases had been confirmed among facility A employees, enhanced testing for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, was implemented, so that any employee with a COVID-19-compatible sign or symptom (e.g., fever, cough, or shortness of breath) could receive a test from a local health care facility. By April 11, 369 COVID-19 cases had been confirmed among facility A employees; on April 12, facility A began a phased closure* and did not reopen during the period of investigation (March 16-April 25, 2020). At the request of SDDOH, a CDC team arrived on April 15 to assist with the investigation. During March 16-April 25, a total of 929 (25.6%) laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases were diagnosed among 3,635 facility A employees. At the outbreak's peak, an average of 67 cases per day occurred. An additional 210 (8.7%) cases were identified among 2,403 contacts of employees with diagnosed COVID-19. Overall, 48 COVID-19 patients were hospitalized, including 39 employees and nine contacts. Two employees died; no contacts died. Attack rates were highest among department-groups where employees tended to work in proximity (i.e., <6 feet [2 meters]) to one another on the production line. Cases among employees and their contacts declined to approximately 10 per day within 7 days of facility closure. SARS-CoV-2 can spread rapidly in meat processing facilities because of the close proximity of workstations and prolonged contact between employees (1,2). Facilities can reduce this risk by implementing a robust mitigation program, including engineering and administrative controls, consistent with published guidelines (1).","Steinberg, Jonathan; Kennedy, Erin D; Basler, Colin; Grant, Michael P; Jacobs, Jesica R; Ortbahn, Dustin; Osburn, John; Saydah, Sharon; Tomasi, Suzanne; Clayton, Joshua L",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,283,16

Materials and Methods: This study included 306 volunteer adults who applied to our dental clinic for dental interventions during the early days of COVID-19 outbreak in Turkey. All patients responded to a newly created questionnaire composed of four sections with 19 questions those mostly assessing the social and demographic details; like the participant's age, gender, marital status, education status, medical history, basic dental hygiene habits, occupation, and general information about the COVID-19 infection and its protection methods. Results: The outcomes of 306 participants revealed that their gender, age, and education status showed significant distinctions about the dissemination of coronavirus via dental interventions. Higher education status was linked to a loftier level of social awareness about the COVID-19 infection and its potential associations with dental interventions. It was observed that the participants were unsatisfactorily cautious against the COVID-19 infection and its dissemination pathways in their social environment, particularly in the specific case of systematic diseases and preventive measures.

As a guideline, government issued directives on physical distancing and the use of face masks to curb community spread of the disease. Given that public transport has been identified as a high-risk environment for transmission, it was of interest to ascertain user and operator compliance to guidelines for public transport operations during the period, as a measure of its risk level. A roadside observer survey, of over 850 of the most popular paratransit (trotro) buses was carried out on one of the major roads in Kumasi. Compliance to the policy on physical distancing was determined using guidelines from the Ministry of Transport, while compliance to the policy on face masks was determined by the researchers themselves based on the number of commuters with/without face masks per bus. The results suggest that majority (98.0%) of buses comply with the social distancing guidelines established by the Ministry of transport, however the policy on face masks was complied with only partially in most vehicles. About 12.6% of the vehicles had fewer than three commuters without face masks, while 21.3% of buses that had fewer than 3 people with face masks. The results suggest public transport remains an area of high risk in the fight against COVID-19. It is recommended that operators are given additional directives that restrict them from allowing commuters without face masks on board their vehicles, and as well, that police enforce the policy through fines.","Dzisi, Emmanuel Komla Junior; Dei, Oscar Akunor",Transp.

Mobile technologies (mTechs) like smartphones, smartwatches, and fitness trackers might help patients in reaching these goals. This review aimed to scope current scientific literature on mTechs in CR to assess the impact on patients' exercise capacity and to identify gaps and future directions for research. PubMed, CENTRAL, and CDSR were systematically searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs). These RCTs had to utilize mTechs to objectively monitor and promote PA of patients during or following CR, aim at improvements in exercise capacity, and be published between December 2014 and December 2019. A total of 964 publications were identified, and 13 studies met all inclusion criteria. Home-based CR with mTechs vs. outpatient CR without mTechs and outpatient CR with mTechs vs. outpatient CR without mTechs did not lead to statistically significant differences in exercise capacity. In contrast, outpatient CR followed by home-based CR with mTechs led to significant improvement in exercise capacity as compared to outpatient CR without further formal CR. Supplying patients with mTechs may improve exercise capacity. To ensure that usage of and compliance with mTechs is optimal, a concentrated effort of CR staff has to be achieved. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an unprecedented lack of patient support while away from institutional CR. Even though mTechs lend themselves as suitable assistants, evidence is lacking that they can fill this gap.","Meinhart, Florian; Stütz, Thomas; Sareban, Mahdi; Kulnik, Stefan Tino; Niebauer, Josef",Sensors (Basel),283,30

In conclusion, owing to their ability to target functional macromolecules of SARS-CoV-2, along with positive ADMET properties, quinoline,1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-1-[(2-phenylcyclopropyl)sulfonyl]-trans-(8CI), saquinavir, elvitegravir, oxolinic acid, and rilapladib are suggested for the treatment of COVID-19.","Alexpandi, Rajaiah; De Mesquita, Joelma Freire; Pandian, Shunmugiah Karutha; Ravi, Arumugam Veera",Front.

Intensive care unit (ICU) nurses are at risk of burnout and the COVID-19 pandemic may increase this risk. The objectives of this study were to assess the prevalence of burnout risk and identify risk factors among ICU nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESEARCH METHODOLOGY: Web-based survey performed during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in French speaking Belgium. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Risk of burnout was assessed with the Maslach Burnout Inventory scale. RESULTS: A total of 1135 ICU nurses responded to the questionnaire. The overall prevalence of burnout risk was 68%. A total of 29% of ICU nurses were at risk of depersonalisation (DP), 31% of reduced personal accomplishment (PA), and 38% of emotional exhaustion (EE). A 1:3 nurse-to-patient ratio increased the risk of EE (OR = 1.77, 95% CI: 1.07-2.95) and DP (OR = 1.38, 95% CI: 1.09-2.40). Those who reported having a higher perceived workload during the COVID-19 pandemic were at higher risk for all dimensions of burnout. Shortage of personal protective equipment increased the risk of EE (OR = 1.78, 95% CI: 1.35-3.34) and nurses who reported having symptoms of COVID-19 without being tested were at higher risk of EE (OR = 1.40, 95% CI: 1.68-1.87). CONCLUSIONS: Two-thirds of ICU nurses were at risk of burnout and this risk was associated with their working conditions during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. We recommend monitoring the risk of burnout and implementing interventions to prevent and manage it, taking into account the factors identified in this study.","Bruyneel, Arnaud; Smith, Pierre; Tack, Jérôme; Pirson, Magali",Intensive Crit Care Nurs,283,28

METHODS: A total of 1211 non-severe patients with COVID-19 were retrospectively enrolled. Multivariate Cox regression was performed to identify the risk factors associated with long-term SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding, and a prediction model was established. RESULTS: In the training set, 796 patients were divided into the long-term (> 21 days) group (n = 116, 14.6%) and the short-term (&#8804; 21 days) group (n = 680, 85.4%) based on their viral shedding duration. Multivariate analysis identified that age > 50 years, comorbidity, CD4-positive T-lymphocytes count (CD4 + T cell) &#8804; 410 cells/ul, C-reactive protein (CRP) > 10 mg/L, and the corticosteroid use were independent risk factors for long-term SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding. Incorporating the five risk factors, a prediction model, named as the CCCCA score, was established, and its area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUROC) was 0.87 in the training set and 0.83 in the validation set, respectively. In the validation set, using a cut-off of 8 points, we found sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 51.7%, 92.2%, 33.3%, and 96.2%, respectively. Long-term SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding increased from 14/370 (3.8%) in patients with CCCCA < 8 points to 15/45 (33.3%) in patients with CCCCA &#8805; 8 points. CONCLUSION: Using the CCCCA score, clinicians can identify patients with long-term SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding.","Huang, Chen Lu; Fei, Ling; Li, WeiXia; Xu, Wei; Xie, Xu Dong; Li, Qiang; Chen, Liang",,283,1

Bioluminescence imaging revealed the successful delivery and transfection of AAV-luciferase. AAV-green fluorescent protein-transfected cardiomyocytes were homogeneously distributed on postoperative day 28. AAV-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-loaded MNs improved heart function by enhancing VEGF expression, promoting functional angiogenesis, and activating the Akt signaling pathway. The results indicated the superiority of MNs over direct muscle injection. Consequently, MNs might emerge as a promising tool with great versatility for delivering various agents to treat ischemic myocardial disease.","Shi, Hongpeng; Xue, Tong; Yang, Yang; Jiang, Chenyu; Huang, Shixing; Yang, Qi; Lei, Dong; You, Zhengwei; Jin, Tuo; Wu, Fei; Zhao, Qiang; Ye, Xiaofeng",Sci.

A decline of 3.7% in the global energy demand at about 150 million tonnes of oil equivalent (Mtoe) in the first quarter (Q1), of 2020 was recorded, as compared to the same first quarter (Q1), of 2019, due to the cutback on global economic activities. Our results showed that: 1) electricity production for the same period in the years 2018, 2019, and 2020, shrunk at an offset of about 9.20%, which resulted in the modest reduction of about (-1.79%), in the atmospheric CO$_2$, to that of 2017-2018 CO$_2$ level; 2) a non-seasonal abrupt; but brief, atmospheric CO$_2$ decrease by about 0.85% in mid-February 2020, could be due to the Phase 1 movement restrictions in China. The results showed that, the reduction in electricity production is significant to the short-term variability of atmospheric CO$_2$. It also highlights the significant contributions from China to the atmospheric CO$_2$, which suggests that, without the national restriction of activities, CO$_2$ concentration are set to exceed 2019 by 1.79%, but it quickly decreased due to the lockdown, and sustained the reduction for two consecutive months. The results underscore the atmospheric CO$_2$ reductions on the monthly time scale that can be achieved, if electricity production from combustible sources were slashed, which could be useful for cost-benefit analyses of the reduction in electricity production from combustible sources, and the impact of these reduction to the atmospheric CO$_2$.","Yusup, Yusri; Kayode, John Stephen; Ahmad, Mardiana Idayu; Yin, Chee Su; Hisham, Muhammad Sabiq Mohamad Nor; Isa, Hassim Mohamad",,283,20

Implementation of one or more social distancing policies resulted in an additional 24.5% reduction in mobility the following week, and subsequent shelter-in-place mandates yielded an additional 29.0% reduction. Decreases in mobility were associated with substantial reductions in case growth two to four weeks later. For example, a 10% reduction in mobility was associated with a 17.5% reduction in case growth two weeks later.

To explore these factors, we conducted a prospective mixed-methods study to assess the relationship between telemedicine utilization and socio-demographic factors among patients seeking eye care. We also assessed patient satisfaction with eye care using a health disparities lens. Methods : We conducted phone interviews with a stratified random sample of 1,720 patients who had a visit scheduled at the University of Michigan Kellogg Eye Center in Ann Arbor, Michigan from 4/30/20-5/25/20 to ascertain patient perception of care received during the COVID-19 pandemic. The participant data was stratified by visit type and then analyzed by demographic variables. A Chi-square test was used to assess for association between categorical variables. Associations between visit type were determined using a multinomial logistic regression model. Open ended questions were stratified by race and analyzed using grounded theory to identify whether themes varied through a disparities lens. Results : Non-white patients had lower odds of having an in-person visit (p<0.02). Older patients had lower odds of having a video visit (p=0.007) and higher odds of having an inperson visit (p=0.023) compared to younger patients. The mean neighborhood median household income varied significantly (p<0.0001) by race with Blacks having the lowest estimated mean. Access to broadband signal with faster download speeds compared to slower was associated with lower odds of an in-person visit (p=0.022). No differences between races were identified in patient satisfaction or perception of care. Conclusions : Disparities existed in how patients accessed eye care during the COVID-19 pandemic with non-white patients less likely to access care. Coupled with other barriers such as lower income, which, on a population level, may limit access to broadband internet, reimbursing telemedicine solely through broadband internet connection may further exacerbate disparities in access to eye care. Insurers should consider continued reimbursement of telemedicine delivered via phone to prevent further marginalization of underserved communities.","Sidhom, D.; Ugoh, P.; Newman-Casey, P.

COVID-19;the unexpected pandemic decease is a good testimony of the above proverb by exemplifying global business operations shutting down. Pre COVID-19, the business across the globe more or less are planned one;running smoothly;trying to reach their goals and objectives;satisfying the customers, finally leading to leapfrog the companies’ profits. This was the scenario, before the coronavirus;the alias of COVID-19 pandemic, which was germinated in one of the most scientific cities in china;Wuhan. Entire world business collapsed;another global economic recession after 2008;touching all the continents, countries, business, tribes, religions, lifestyles, as well as professional lives. No medicine was unable to save the lakhs of human life from contamination. Even different country leaders practised various preventive methods in order to cure the decease to save human life. In this light, this book chapter will explore the state of the art of COVID-19 across the globe with respect to business. The entire data analysis is based on secondary on-line data and thematically narrated. The book chapter furtherly discussed in detail connotes, process and state of art of software engineering and software analytics in business for sustainability. The analysis reveals that software analytics technology is the only industry lightly affected, should grow rapidly and it is the only solution provider to improve the process, and sustain business via better-automated software.

In this review, we discuss the effects of soy isoflavones on the overall gut function and inflammation and assess how these effects might be implicated in the treatment of several gut-related diseases. RECENT FINDINGS: Soy isoflavones influence several key aspects of gastrointestinal health: improve basal intestinal secretion, alleviate inflammation, limit intestinal morphological damage, and improve epithelial barrier function in several clinically relevant murine models of gastrointestinal diseases. Dietary supplementation with isoflavones proves to be a key means to improve the overall gut function and health.

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in the Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Thailand. All undergraduate medical students were requested to voluntarily respond to an electronic survey. Demographic data, related factors of happiness and stress, scores from the Thai version of the Oxford Happiness Questionnaire (Thai-OHQ), and Thai Stress Questionnaire (Thai-ST5) were collected. RESULTS: There were 369 responses, 64.8% from preclinical students and 35.2% responses from clinical students, and 53.9% were women. The mean age of the participants was 20.62±1.81 years. The most frequent platforms that the students used to track COVID-19 information were Facebook 43.9% and Twitter 43.4%. Both groups had a low level of stress. No difference was found in the Thai-OHQ score (p=0.323) and the Thai-ST5 score (p=0.278). With multivariable analysis, two factors significantly related to the happier students included higher health satisfaction scores (p<0.001) and maintaining an exercise program during the COVID-19 pandemic (p=0.015). CONCLUSION: There was no difference in the happiness and stress levels between the two groups during the first outbreak of COVID-19 in Thailand. To increase happiness, promoting awareness of health satisfaction and regularity of exercise for the medical students should be initiated. To direct the information during a disease outbreak such as the COVID-19 pandemic, Facebook, and Twitter are the primary platforms to use.","Isaradisaikul, Suwicha Kaewsiri; Thansuwonnont, Pichcha; Sangthongluan, Phatsaworn",Korean J Med Educ,283,0

407258,407258,407258,Are children essentially immune to COVID? - A review,15.119254,2.1741238,2020,"BACKGROUND: High rates of motorization in urban areas of Africa have adverse effects on public health. Transport-related mortality will increase as a result of inadequate transport infrastructure, air pollution and sedentary lifestyles. Health Impact Assessments (HIAs) have proven to be a successful tool to predict and mitigate negative health impact of urban transport planning policies, programmes or projects. Yet, there is a gap of evidence on transport and health in African countries. The aim of this study is assessing the health impacts of transport scenarios in Port Louis (city of 119,018 inhabitants in Mauritius) using a full chain participatory HIA model. METHODS: We estimated health and economic impacts associated to transport scenarios with qualitative data and quantitative comparative risk assessment methods. The health impact modeling was based on differences between the baseline and three transport scenarios (worse, good, ideal), estimating the averted deaths per year and economic outcomes by assessing health determinants of air pollution (AP), traffic deaths and physical activity (PA). Data on air pollution and traffic fatalities were obtained from public data sources. Data used to construct scenarios, establish baseline travel mode shares and physical activity were collected through (a) open-ended individual interviews (IDIs) with 14 stakeholders (b) closed-ended survey questions to 600 citizens and (c) 2 focus group discussions (FGDs) with the same 14 stakeholders from (a). RESULTS: In Port Louis, the worse-case transport scenario (doubling in car trips and a reduction in walking, motorcycle, and public transport), resulted in a total increment of 3.28 premature deaths per year. The good-case scenario (reducing car trips by half and increasing walking, motorcycle, and public transport trips) resulted in a total increment of 0.79 premature deaths per year. The ideal-case scenario (reduction in car and motorcycle trips and an increase in walking and public transport trips) resulted in a total reduction of 13.72 premature deaths per year. We estimated USD 23 millions of economic benefits related to mortality if the ideal-case was achieved. CONCLUSION: Participatory HIA shows that implementing transport policies aiming for less than an ideal situation may not be adequate or sufficient to avoid negative transport-related mortality in Mauritius. Urban transport planning is an opportunity to encourage physical activity in rapidly urbanizing settings of Africa. Transport policies should aim to restrict all forms of private motorized vehicles and promote active and public transport to support public health. We highly recommend the use of participatory approaches in quantitative HIA to ensure context specificity and policy relevance.","Thondoo, M; Mueller, N; Rojas-Rueda, D; de Vries, D; Gupta, J; Nieuwenhuijsen, M J",Environ Int,283,21

METHODS AND RESULTS: This observational study was performed using Istituto Superiore di Sanità (ISS) Tuscany COVID-19 database by the Agenzia Regionale Sanità (ARS), including all COVID-19 cases registered until April 30th, 2020, with reported information on chronic diseases. The principal outcome was hospitalization. An age and gender-adjusted logistic regression model was used to assess the association of clinical and demographic characteristics with hospitalization. Further multivariate models were applied. Of 4481 included subjects (36.9% aged over 70 years), 1907 (42.6%) were admitted to hospital. Obesity was associated with hospitalization after adjusting for age and gender. The association of obesity with hospitalization retained statistical significance in a fully adjusted model, including possible confounders (OR: 2.99 [IC 95% 2.04-4.37]). The effect of obesity was more evident in younger (<70 years) than in older (&#8805;70 years) subjects.

The article focuses on the clinical component of the preservice curriculum (practice teaching and methods courses). It reveals that curriculum became malleable in two major ways: there was (1) a shift to learner-centered well-being and social emotional learning (SEL); and (2) an adaptation of teaching methods. The Covid-19 shutdown imposed a restructuring of the content, sequence, and scope of the curriculum. While certain topics were omitted or reduced in scope, others-especially those related to digital instruction-were introduced or expanded. Pedagogy instructors also began to attend to their students' well-being by introducing SEL contents and activities. This response during challenging times revealed teacher educators' adaptability, resilience, and agency.

It has caused a global pandemic with more than three hundred thousand case fatalities. However, apart from supportive care by respirators, no standard medical therapy is validated. Areas covered: This paper presents old drugs with potential in vitro efficacy against SARS-CoV-2. The in vitro database, adverse effects, and potential toxicities of these drugs are reviewed regarding their feasibility of clinical prescription for the treatment of patients with COVID-19. To obtain convincing recommendations, we referred to opinions from the US National Institute of Health regarding drugs repurposed for COVID-19 therapy. Expert opinion: Although strong evidence of well-designed randomized controlled studies regarding COVID-19 therapy is presently lacking, remdesivir, teicoplanin, hydroxychloroquine (not in combination with azithromycin), and ivermectin might be effective antiviral drugs and are deemed promising candidates for controlling SARS-CoV-2. In addition, tocilizumab might be considered as the supplementary treatment for COVID-19 patients with cytokine release syndrome. In future, clinical trials regarding a combination of potentially effective drugs against SARS-CoV-2 need to be conducted to establish the optimal regimen for the treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19.","Jean, Shio-Shin; Hsueh, Po-Ren",Expert Rev Anti Infect Ther,283,1

Moreover, some particular features related to COVID-19 are also discussed. SUMMARY: Apart from a thorough preoperative assessment, preventive strategies and well-chosen monitoring should be implemented to preclude inadvertent events in sometimes high-risk patients. Timely preventive measures and early recognition of complications could only be achieved by a multidisciplinary cooperating team.

As in other countries of the world, public authorities in Turkey are implementing many preventive and mitigating partial lockdown (PL) actions against the virus's effects. Some decisions and policies implemented before and after March 11, 2020, when the first virus case has been identified, have reduced people and traffic circulation, which has also turned into some improvements in air quality. At this point, this study aims to investigate how this pandemic affects the air quality of a metropolis. A case study of the city of Istanbul, the most affected city with more than half of Turkey's cases, is performed. In our analysis, we observe, compare, and discuss the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and PL decisions on Istanbul city's air quality. We consider the particulate matter (PM10), sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), nitrogen oxide (NO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and ozone (O3) concentrations. We used data from 19 air monitoring stations (AMSs) and obtained improvements in the air quality for the pandemic period. In summary, the concentration levels in PM10, NO2, NO, and NOx result in a clear decline in pandemic times compared to the normal times in Istanbul. On the other hand, a non-homogenous trend for SO2 and CO concentrations is observed for different AMSs. A partial increase in O2 concentration is obtained in the comparison of before and during the PL period.","Celik, Erkan; Gul, Muhammet",Environ Dev Sustain,283,6

We evaluated sensitivity and specificity of five different widely used commercial serological assays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG, IgM, and IgA antibodies using reverse transcriptase-PCR assay in nasopharyngeal swab as reference standard test. Methods: A total of 337 plasma samples collected in the period April-June 2020 from SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive (n = 207) and negative (n = 130) subjects were investigated by one point-of-care lateral flow immunochromatographic assay (LFIA IgG and IgM, Technogenetics) and four fully automated assays: two chemiluminescence immunoassays (CLIA-iFlash IgG and IgM, Shenzhen YHLO Biotech and CLIA-LIAISON® XL IgG, DiaSorin), one electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA-Elecsys® total predominant IgG, Roche), and one enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA IgA, Euroimmune). Results: The overall sensitivity of all IgG serological assays was >80% and the specificity was >97%. The sensitivity of IgG assays was lower within 2 weeks from the onset of symptoms ranging from 70.8 to 80%. The LFIA and CLIA-iFlash IgM showed an overall low sensitivity of 47.6 and 54.6%, while the specificity was 98.5 and 96.2%, respectively. The ELISA IgA yielded a sensitivity of 84.3% and specificity of 81.7%. However, the ELISA IgA result was indeterminate in 11.7% of cases. Conclusions: IgG serological assays seem to be a reliable tool for the retrospective diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. IgM assays seem to have a low sensitivity and IgA assay is limited by a substantial rate of indeterminate results.","Chiereghin, Angela; Zagari, Rocco Maurizio; Galli, Silvia; Moroni, Alessandra; Gabrielli, Liliana; Venturoli, Simona; Bon, Isabella; Rossini, Giada; Saracino, Ilaria Maria; Pavoni, Matteo; Lafratta, Silvia; Deni, Alessandro; Felici, Silvia; Borghi, Michele; Guerra, Luca; Raumer, Luigi; Lodi, Vittorio; Viale, Pierluigi; Attard, Luciano; Lazzarotto, Tiziana",Front Public Health,283,24

STUDY DESIGN: This study design is a retrospective cohort study. METHODS: This study is conducted in Tan Tock Seng Hospital, a University affiliated 1600-bed public hospital in Singapore. Patients with pneumonia admitted under our Enhanced Pneumonia Surveillance (EPS) program from 7 February 2020 to 20 March 2020 were included. Relevant clinical variables were collated. RESULTS: Of 1295 patients admitted under our EPS program, 47 (3.6%) patients tested positive for COVID-19. The prevalence of a radiologist-reported normal chest X-ray (CXR) in the COVID-19-positive group was 62.8% compared with 6.2% in the COVID-19-negative group. In patients with a normal CXR, a low normal white blood cell (WBC) count and minimal C-reactive protein (CRP) elevation were associated with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: The pick-up rate of COVID-19 in low-risk patients with pneumonia is 3.6%. However, at least 7.9% of patients who were isolated had a normal CXR.

Methods: In this retrospective study, the records of patients presented with diabetic macular edema (DME) and non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy were reviewed. DME defined as clinically significant macular edema was treated by using argon green or yellow dye laser with focal, grid, and modified grid techniques according to Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study parameters. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was measured. BCVA change after the treatment and its relationship with other factors were evaluated. Results: The study included 133 eyes of 81 patients. The mean follow-up was 28.26 months. BCVA demonstrated the increase of 2 lines or more in 20.7% of the eyes, stabilization within 2 lines in 60.7% of the eyes, and loss of 2 lines or more in 18.3% of the eyes. The eyes with baseline BCVA lower than or equal to 0.50 showed a statistically significant increase (p=0.001) whereas the eyes with baseline BCVA of more than 0.50 did not show a statistically significant change (p=0.070) after laser photocoagulation treatment. Conclusions: Conventional laser photocoagulation is an effective treatment in diabetic macular edema including center-involved type and stabilizes visual acuity in the majority of the patients. Improvement in BCVA is significant in the group with lower baseline BCVA.

Current ENETS guidelines advocate resection of all localised d-NETs. However, 'watch and wait' may be appropriate for some localised, small, grade 1, non-functioning, non-ampullary d-NETs. We evaluated whether patients with such d-NETs who chose 'watch and wait' involving regular endoscopic surveillance had equivalent disease-related outcomes to patients undergoing endoscopic or surgical resection. Methods Retrospective review of patients with histologically confirmed d-NETs at Liverpool ENETS Centre of Excellence 2007-2020. Results Sixty-nine patients were diagnosed with d-NET of which fifty were sporadic, non-functioning, non-ampullary tumours. Patient treatment groups were similar in terms of age, gender, tumour location and grade, but unsurprisingly, larger tumours (median diameter 17mm (p<0.0001)) were found in the surgically treated group. Five patients underwent surgical resection with no evidence of tumour recurrence or disease-related death. Twelve patients underwent endoscopic resection, with one local recurrence detected during follow-up. Thirty patients (28 with d-NETs &#8804;10mm) underwent 'watch and wait' with resection only if tumours increased in size. The d-NETs in 28/30 patients remained stable or decreased in size over a median 27 months (IQR:15-48, R:3-98). In seven patients the d-NET was completely removed by avulsion during diagnostic biopsy and was not seen at subsequent endoscopies. Only two patients showed increased d-NET size during surveillance, of whom only one was fit for endoscopic resection. No NET-related deaths were documented during follow up. Conclusions All of the localised, &#8804;10mm, grade 1, non-functioning, non-ampullary d-NETs in this cohort behaved indolently with very low risks of progression and no tumour-related deaths. 'Watch and wait' therefore appears to be a safe alternative management strategy for selected d-NETs.","Exarchou, Klaire; Moore, Andrew R; Smart, Howard L; Duckworth, Carrie A; Howes, Nathan; Pritchard, D Mark",Neuroendocrinology,283,22

From Wuhan, China, in December 2019 to European countries, USA and now it seems to gain a strong foothold in India. The objective of this work is to report the initial experience with demographic and clinical features, and management of COVID-19 patients admitted in medical college Bhilwara, India. Methods: This is a descriptive case series of first 26 COVID-19 patients. Demographical, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and outcomes data were obtained with data collection forms and history given by 26 COVID-19 patients. Results and Discussion: During this study 26 COVID-19 positive patients were admitted in MG Hospital, Bhilwara. Male patients were 61.54% and majority (88.46%) were below 60 years of age. Approximately 30.76 % patients were asymptomatic. Fever was the most common symptom (61.54%) followed by sore throat (53.84 %), cough (42.30%) myalgia (38.46%)and dyspnea(23.07%). Six patients (23.07%) of total 26 had comorbidities. Leucopenia was seen in in 9 (34.61%) and leukocytosis was seen in 2 patient. Ten patient (38.46%) out of 26 shown increased lymphocyte/neutrophil ratio. Chest X- ray was normal in 20 patients (76.92%). Abnormalities in chest CT were detected among 10 (38.46%) patients. Typical findings were bilateral multifocal patchy peripheral subsegmental areas of consolidation more towards middle and lower zones and bilateral ground glass opacities involving multiple segments. Oseltamivir and chloroquine were given to all 26 patients. Azithromycin was given in 24 patients. Mean duration of conversion of COVID-19 patients was 6.83 days. All discharged patients advised home quarantine for 14 days as per guidelines. Conclusion: Patients often present without fever, and many may not have abnormal radiologic findings. Patients with older age and associated comorbid conditions (COPD and diabetes) seem to have greater risk for lung injury.","Gaur, Arun; Meena, Surender Kumar; Bairwa, Ramavtar; Meena, Daulat; Nanda, Rajan; Sharma, Shiv Raj; Rajawat, Govind Singh",J Assoc Physicians India,283,3

Even with its importance, very limited biophysical studies are available on the N protein because of its high level of disorder, high propensity for aggregation, and high susceptibility for autoproteolysis. Here, we successfully prepare the N protein and a 1000-nucleotide fragment of viral RNA in large quantities and purity suitable for biophysical studies. A combination of biophysical and biochemical techniques demonstrates that the N protein is partially disordered and consists of an independently folded RNA-binding domain and a dimerization domain, flanked by disordered linkers. The protein assembles as a tight dimer with a dimerization constant of sub-micromolar but can also form transient interactions with other N proteins, facilitating larger oligomers. NMR studies on the â¼100-kDa dimeric protein identify a specific domain that binds 1-1000-nt RNA and show that the N-RNA complex remains highly disordered. Analytical ultracentrifugation, isothermal titration calorimetry, multiangle light scattering, and cross-linking experiments identify a heterogeneous mixture of complexes with a core corresponding to at least 70 dimers of N bound to 1-1000 RNA. In contrast, very weak binding is detected with a smaller construct corresponding to the RNA-binding domain using similar experiments. A model that explains the importance of the bivalent structure of N to its binding on multivalent sites of the viral RNA is presented.","Forsythe, Heather M; Rodriguez Galvan, Joaquin; Yu, Zhen; Pinckney, Seth; Reardon, Patrick; Cooley, Richard B; Zhu, Phillip; Rolland, Amber D; Prell, James S; Barbar, Elisar",Biophys. j,283,26

Identification of individuals at increased risk of developing these conditions would help to target them for prevention and ultimately reduce the healthcare burden. We developed a 10-year predictive algorithm for depression and anxiety using the full cohort of over 400,000 UK Biobank (UKB) participants without pre-existing depression or anxiety using digitally obtainable information. From the initial 204 variables selected from UKB, processed into>520 features, iterative backward elimination using Cox proportional hazards model was performed to select predictors which account for the majority of its predictive capability. Baseline and reduced models were then trained for depression and anxiety using both Cox and DeepSurv, a deep neural network approach to survival analysis. The baseline Cox model achieved concordance of 0.813 and 0.778 on the validation dataset for depression and anxiety, respectively. For the DeepSurv model, respective concordance indices were 0.805 and 0.774. After feature selection, the depression model contained 43 predictors and the concordance index was 0.801 for both Cox and DeepSurv. The reduced anxiety model, with 27 predictors, achieved concordance of 0.770 in both models. The final models showed good discrimination and calibration in the test datasets.We developed predictive risk scores with high discrimination for depression and anxiety using the UKB cohort, incorporating predictors which are easily obtainable via smartphone. If deployed in a digital solution, it would allow individuals to track their risk, as well as provide some pointers to how to decrease it through lifestyle changes.","Morelli, D.; Dolezalova, N.; Ponzo, S.; Colombo, M.; Plans, D.",,283,26

This question captures several applications where we have uncertainty about the quality of candidates (e.g. auction bids, search results) and have the capacity to explore only a small subset due to an exogenous constraint. For example, consider a second price auction where system constraints (e.g., costly retrieval or model computation) allow the participation of only $k$ out of $n$ bidders, and the goal is to optimize the expected efficiency (highest bid) or expected revenue (second highest bid). We study the case where we are given an explicit description of each random variable. We give a PTAS for the problem of maximizing the expected highest value. For the second-highest value, we prove a hardness result: assuming the Planted Clique Hypothesis, there is no constant factor approximation algorithm that runs in polynomial time. Surprisingly, under the assumption that each random variable has monotone hazard rate (MHR), a simple score-based algorithm, namely picking the $k$ random variables with the largest $1/\sqrt{k}$ top quantile value, is a constant approximation to the expected highest and second highest value, \emph{simultaneously}.","Mehta, Aranyak; Nadav, Uri; Psomas, Alexandros; Rubinstein, Aviad",,283,20

For the past 8 years CCT has delivered face-to-face mock CASC exams and received excellent feedback from candidates and examiners, in addition to an extremely positive outcome of improvement in CASC pass rate for candidates.Due to the current COVID-19 pandemic restrictions delivery of the mock CASC examination had to be adapted with the aim of running it remotely via an online platform.MethodThe examinations were run online via Zoom due to its ease of use, including the ability to screen share candidate instructions and assign participants in to breakout rooms. One lead exam coordinator manually rotated candidates around the circuit of 16 stations.ResultA total of 16 candidates sat the mock exam over two separate sittings. Written feedback was obtained from candidates and examiners. Limitations identified during the initial sitting included high logistical workload for the lead exam co-ordinator and Zoom not being supported by all hospital computer internet browsers, these issues were addressed prior to the second sitting. Feedback from candidates regarding the overall experience of the online exams ranged from 'extremely effective’ to ‘very effective’, this is in line with feedback obtained following previous face-to-face mock exam events CCT has run.ConclusionAlthough online learning may feel very different to the face-to-face interactions we are all used to we are in an era where adaption is necessary.

Information is needed on which measures are, or are not, being undertaken. Data collected from the COVID Impact Survey, conducted by the non-partisan and objective research organization NORC at the University of Chicago on April, May, and June of 2020, were analyzed through weighted Quasi-Poisson regression modeling to determine the association of demographics, socioeconomics, and health conditions with protective health measures taken at the individual level in response to COVID-19. The three surveys included data from 18 regional areas including 10 states (CA, CO, FL, LA, MN, MO, MT, NY, OR, and TX) and 8 Metropolitan Statistical Areas (Atlanta, GA; Baltimore, MD; Birmingham, AL; Chicago, IL; Cleveland and Columbus, OH; Phoenix, AZ; and Pittsburgh, PA). Individuals with higher incomes, insurance, higher education levels, large household size, age 60+, females, minorities, those who have asthma, have hypertension, overweight or obese, and those who suffer from mental health issues during the pandemic were significantly more likely to report taking precautionary protective measures relative to their counterparts. Protective measures for the three subgroups with a known relationship to COVID-19 (positive for COVID-19, knowing an individual with COVID-19, and knowing someone who had died from COVID-19) were strongly associated with the protective health measures of washing hands, avoiding public places, and canceling social engagements.

METHOD: A total of 984 participants completed a self-administered online questionnaire. RESULTS: Over 90% were healthy (i.e., not in a high-risk health-related group for COVID-19), did not have COVID-19 symptoms within 30 d, and always/frequently engaged in preventive measures. Fifty-eight percent thought that they had a 0% to 25% chance of having immunity/antibodies to COVID-19. Non-dental health care workers thought that their chance was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than others. Over 70% were sometimes, frequently, or always worried about their friends and loved ones getting COVID-19 and of resulting financial problems. Dental workers were significantly less afraid than non-dental health care and non-health care providers. For all groups, more than half of the respondents stated that the pandemic had a negative (somewhat worse or worse) impact on daily life (59%), interactions with others (65%), stress levels (66%), and enjoyment of life (56%). There were significant differences among all 3 groups regarding the percentage of individuals with a negative impact on job security (dental, 47%; non-dental health care, 34%; non-health care, 31%). However, more than half of the respondents stated that the pandemic had a positive impact (same, somewhat better, or much better) on caring about one another, self-care, and exercise. Knowing the results of an antibody test would decrease the level of stress and anxiety in 67% of respondents. Over 80% found a COVID-19 test received in a dental setting acceptable, were ""definitely"" satisfied, and would ""definitely"" recommend it to a friend, family, or coworker. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support that dental workers are as vulnerable as other essential workers to threats and psychological impacts of COVID-19. They also support the acceptability and satisfaction of testing for a pandemic done in a dental setting. KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER STATEMENT: The results of this study highlight the impact that pandemics such as COVID-19 can have on life experiences of essential workers, including dentists. It also highlights a role that dentistry can play within the broader health care system, during and beyond the current pandemic, to help with surveillance efforts of community health.

We investigated the effect of administering enteral favipiravir at a 2 × 1,600 mg loading dose and 2 × 600 mg maintenance dose for 5 days in addition to the standard COVID-19 treatment. RESULTS: In total, 180 patients, who were hospitalized at the Istanbul Tuzla State Hospital and received favipiravir treatment between March 20, 2020 and May 30, 2020, were examined. Of these, 47 patients died. Thirty-three of the patients who died were aged over 65 years (70%), indicating that fatality was higher in elderly patients. Most of those who died had at least one comorbidity. Of the 101 patients who initiated favipiravir within &#8804;3 days of hospitalization, 17 died (17%). Of the 79 patients who initiated favipiravir after >3 days of hospitalization, 30 died (38%) (P = 0.002).

Inequalities in the region lead to barriers regarding the best use of diagnostic tests during the pandemic. There is a need for a simplified guideline, considering the region's health resources' low availability, international guidelines, medical literature, and local expertise. METHODS: Nine experts from Latin American countries developed a simplified algorithm for COVID-19 diagnosis, using a modified Delphi method. Twenty-four questions related to diagnostic settings were proposed, followed by discussion of the literature and experts' experience. RESULTS: The algorithm considers three timeframes (&#8804;7 days, 8-13 days, and &#8805; 14 days) and discusses diagnostic options for each one. SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR is the test of choice from day 1 to day 14 after symptom onset or close contact, although antigen testing may be used in particular situations, from days 5 to 7. Antibody assays may be used for confirmation, mainly after day 14. If the clinical suspicion is very high, but other tests are negative, these assays may be used as an adjunct to decision-making from day 8 to day 13. CONCLUSION: The proposed algorithm aims to support COVID-19 diagnosis decision-making in Latin America.","Fay, Fabian F; Alvarez-Moreno, Carlos Arturo; Bonvehi, Pablo E; Espinoza, Carolina Cucho; Hidalgo, Marco Luis Herrera; Marcano-Lozada, Marcel; Perez, Carlos M; Pulchinelli, Alvaro; Sáenz-Flor, Klever Vinicio; Condino-Neto, Antonio",Int. j. infect. dis,283,24

In the present study, we aimed to discuss the treatment response of TCZ therapy in COVID-19 infected patients. The demographic, treatment, laboratory parameters of C-reactive protein (CRP) and IL-6 before and after TCZ therapy and clinical outcome in the 15 COVID-19 patients were retrospectively assessed. Totally 15 patients with COVID-19 were included in this study. Two of them were moderately ill, six were seriously ill and seven were critically ill. The TCZ was used in combination with methylprednisolone in eight patients. Five patients received the TCZ administration twice or more. Although TCZ treatment ameliorated the increased CRP in all patients rapidly, for the four critically ill patients who received an only single dose of TCZ, three of them (No. 1, 2, and 3) still dead and the CRP level in the rest one patient (No. 7) failed to return to normal range with a clinical outcome of disease aggravation. Serum IL-6 level tended to further spiked firstly and then decreased after TCZ therapy in 10 patients. A persistent and dramatic increase of IL-6 was observed in these four patients who failed treatment. TCZ appears to be an effective treatment option in COVID-19 patients with a risk of cytokine storms. And for these critically ill patients with elevated IL-6, the repeated dose of the TCZ is recommended.","Luo, Pan; Liu, Yi; Qiu, Lin; Liu, Xiulan; Liu, Dong; Li, Juan",J Med Virol,283,16

There are no detailed data on the possible changes in the epidemiology and treatment of DRFs in children and adults during the Covid pandemic. The purpose of our study was a comprehensive assessment of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on distal radius fractures (DRF) epidemiology, including both children and adults and various fracture fixation methods in two large trauma centers in Poland. METHODS: This study compared the medical data on the treatment of distal radius fractures in Poland in two periods: the period of the COVID-19 pandemic (from March 15 to October 15, 2020) and the corresponding period prior to the pandemic (from March 15 to October 15, 2019). We assessed detailed data from two trauma centers for pediatric and adult patients. Outpatients seeking medical attention at emergency departments and inpatients undergoing surgery at trauma-orthopedic wards were evaluated. We compared epidemiological data, demographic data, treatment type, and hospital stay duration. RESULTS: The total number of patients hospitalized due to DRF during the pandemic was 180, it was 15.1% lower than that from the pre-COVID-19 pandemic period (212). In the case of adult patients, the total number of those hospitalized during the pandemic decreased significantly (by 22%) from 132 to 103 patients. Analysis of the individual treatment methods revealed that the number of adults who underwent conservative treatment was considerably (by 30.3%) significantly lower in the period of the COVID-19 pandemic, from 119 to 83 patients. Compared to 13 patients from the pre-pandemic period, the number of surgically treated adults statistically increased to 20 patients (by 53.8%). Our analyses showed hospitalizations of surgically treated adults to be shorter by 12.7% during the pandemic, with the corresponding hospitalizations of surgically treated pediatric patients to be shorter by11.5%. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed a significant impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the epidemiology and treatment of DRFs in children and adults. We found decreased numbers of pediatric and adult patients with DRFs during the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic caused an increase in the number of children and significantly increase adults undergoing surgical treatment for DRFs, a decrease in mean patient age, shorter significantly length of hospital stay, and an increased number of men with DRFs.","Olech, Jaroslaw; Ciszewski, Mariusz; Morasiewicz, Piotr",BMC Musculoskelet Disord,283,1

DESIGN: A prospective, single-center observational study was carried out. SETTING: Intensive care. PATIENTS: Patients admitted due to COVID-19 and respiratory failure. INTERVENTIONS: None. VARIABLES: Automatic recording was made of demographic variables, severity parameters, laboratory data, assisted ventilation (HFO: high-flow oxygen therapy and IMV: invasive mechanical ventilation), oxygenation (PaO2, PaO2/FiO2) and complications. The patients were divided into three groups: survivors (G1), deceased (G2) and patients remaining under admission (G3). The chi-squared test or Fisher exact test (categorical variables) was used, along with the Mann-Whitney U-test or Wilcoxon test for analyzing the differences between medians. Statistical significance was considered for p<0.05. RESULTS: A total of 43 patients were included (G1=28 [65.1%]; G2=10 [23.3%] and G3=5 [11.6%]), with a mean age of 65 years (range: 52-72), 62% males, APACHE II 18 (15-24), SOFA 6 (4-7). Arterial hypertension (30.2%) and obesity (25.6%) were the most frequent comorbidities. High-flow oxygen therapy was used in 62.7% of the patients, with failure in 85%. In turn, 95% of the patients required IMV and 85% received ventilation in prone decubitus. In the general population, initial PaO2/FiO2 improved after 7 days (165 [125-210] vs.194 [153-285]; p=0.02), in the same way as in G1 (164 [125-197] vs. 207 [160-294]; p=0.07), but not in G2 (163 [95-197] vs. 135 [85-177]). No bacterial coinfection was observed. The incidence of IMV-associated pneumonia was high (13 episodes/1000 days of IMV). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COVID-19 require early IMV, a high frequency of ventilation in prone decubitus, and have a high incidence of failed HFO. The lack of improvement of PaO2/FiO2 at 7 days could be a prognostic marker. .","Rodríguez, A; Moreno, G; Gómez, J; Carbonell, R; Picó-Plana, E; Benavent Bofill, C; Sánchez Parrilla, R; Trefler, S; Esteve Pitarch, E; Canadell, L; Teixido, X; Claverias, L; Bodí, M","Med. intensiva (Madr., Ed. impr.)",283,18

This assumption was based on the well known immunomodulatory actions of vitamin D and on the consistent finding of low levels of 25 hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Moreover, several studies reported a correlation between 25OHD levels and different clinical outcomes of the disease. AIM: Aim of the current review was to approach the topic of vitamin D and COVID-19 from a different perspective summarizing the data which led to the evidence of the existence of an endocrine phenotype of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: This review analyzed in the light of the current knowledge the possibility that several endocrine manifestations of COVID-19 could be holistically interpreted in the context of an inadequate vitamin D status.","Giustina, Andrea",Endocrine,283,29

An empirical study with PLS–SEM,15.123782,2.1484659,2020,"Povidone-iodine (PVP-I) is a time-tested antiseptic agent with excellent virucidal (99.99%) properties. Repurposing it against coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) is a relatively newer concept and has been sparsely tested in vivo. The most common route of entry of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2) is the nasopharynx. Averting colonization of the virus could be one of the best options to reduce the incidence of infection. PVP-I gargle and mouthwash were found to be effective in vitro rapid inactivation against SARS-CoV-2 on a smaller scale (Hassandarvish et al. in BDJ 1-4, 2020, Pelletier et al. in ENTJ 1-5, 2020). However, efficacy in humans is lacking. To assess the virucidal effect of PVP-I against SARS-CoV-2 located in the nasopharynx was the objective of this parallel armed randomized clinical trial. We screened all RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases aged 18 years and above with symptoms. Written informed consent was obtained before randomization. Nasopharyngeal clearance of SARS-CoV-2 was tested after single time application of PVP-I nasal irrigation (NI) at diluted concentrations of .4%, .5% and .6% and PVP-I nasal spray (NS) at diluted concentrations of .5% and .6%. All groups were compared to the corresponding controls (distilled water). The primary outcome was viral clearance in a repeat RT-PCR (qualitative), and the secondary outcome was the number of adverse events. Final data analysis was performed using the statistical software SPSS (Version 20). A total of 189 confirmed COVID-19 cases were randomized into seven groups: 27 patients in each group. Of all, 159 (84.1%) were male, and 30 (15.9%) were female. We observed a statistically significant proportion of nasopharyngeal clearance with all strengths of PVP-I NI and PVP-I NS compared to the corresponding controls. Additionally, 0.5% NI was significantly better than 0.5% NS for viral clearance (p = 0.018) and had the highest nasopharyngeal clearance among all strengths (n = 25, 92.6%). 0.6% NS is better than CNS and 0.5%NS in viral clearance. The only adverse event was nasal irritation recorded in two patients each in the 0.4% and 0.6% PVP-I NI groups (Tables 1 and 2). PVP-I NI and NS are proved as effective virucidal agent against SARS-CoV-2 in human body. Our recommendation is to use PVP-I in naopharynx (as well as oropharynx) to prevent COVID-19.","Arefin, Mostafa Kamal; Rumi, S K Nurul Fattah; Uddin, A K M Nasir; Banu, Sultana Sahana; Khan, Mala; Kaiser, Ahsanul; Chowdhury, Joybaer Anam; Khan, Md Abdullah Saeed; Hasan, Mohammad Jahid",Indian J Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,283,24

Trump's storytelling over twenty-seven days in spring 2020 in order to explore the ways in which his performances threatened to destroy the genre of nonfiction political narrative in the United States. The analysis of these twenty-seven days is framed by a Preface, written from the perspective of January 2021 after the attack on the US Capitol by those who believed Trump's Big Lie that he won the 2020 presidential election—an attack indicating that Trump had almost succeeded in destroying the genre. By the spring of 2020, Trump had all but eroded that genre's foundations in referentiality, and his Republican supporters in Congress, in right-wing media, and in the electorate had allowed him to operate on the principle that ""my saying makes things so."" The events of the spring of 2020, however, especially those accompanying the COVID-19 pandemic, provided the greatest resistance to that principle, because the virus was an extratextual reality that was indifferent to Trump's rhetoric. The essay is itself an unfolding narrative, as it traces Trump's storytelling about the pandemic, voting by mail, Barack Obama, and, toward the end of the period, about George Floyd's murder and the protests that followed. This thick description of Trump's performances does not end with a definitive judgment about the fate of the genre of nonfiction political narrative, but instead offers insights into the nature and relentlessness of Trump's attack on that genre that in turn shed light on his Big Lie about the 2020 presidential election.

The prevalence of vaccine acceptance increased from 76.4% (90% effectiveness) to 88.8% (95% effectiveness). Considering a 90% effective vaccine, Malaysia, Thailand, Bangladesh, and five African countries (Democratic Republic of Congo, Benin, Uganda, Malawi, and Mali) had lower acceptance odds compared to Brazil. Individuals who perceived taking the vaccine as important to protect themselves had the highest acceptance odds (aOR 2.49) at 95% effectiveness.Vaccine acceptance was also positively associated with COVID-19 knowledge, worry/fear regarding COVID-19, higher income, younger age, and testing negative for COVID-19. However, chronic disease and female gender reduced the odds for vaccine acceptance. The main reasons underpinning vaccine refusal were fear of side effects (41.2%) and lack of confidence in vaccine effectiveness (15.1%).

The aim is to investigate the correlates of different dimensions of subjective well-being in 10- to 16-year-olds from different cultural contexts. METHODS: An online, self-report questionnaire was completed by 1,613 adolescents in Luxembourg, Germany, and Brazil between May and July 2020. The outcome variables were measures of life satisfaction and emotional well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study included a range of sociodemographic, interpersonal, and intrapersonal covariates. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and latent variable structural equational modeling. RESULTS: A two-factor model of subjective well-being, consisting of life satisfaction and emotional well-being latent constructs, fitted well with this sample data for Luxembourg, Germany, and Brazil. Results showed that gender, socioeconomic status, intrapersonal factors, quantity and type of schoolwork, and relationships with adults were important common predictors of individual differences in subjective well-being during COVID-19. Fear of illness emerged as the strongest correlate of emotional well-being across the three countries. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that girls and adolescents from low-income homes may be especially vulnerable to negative secondary impacts of COVID-19 that can affect mental health. It identified several common correlates of subjective well-being in adolescents from different cultural settings, including factors that may be changeable, such as the following: the way adults listen to adolescents, schoolwork during distant learning, and fear of illness. Findings can inform the development of quality interventions for promoting the well-being of adolescents during a global pandemic.","Engel de Abreu, Pascale M J; Neumann, Sascha; Wealer, Cyril; Abreu, Neander; Coutinho Macedo, Elizeu; Kirsch, Claudine",J Adolesc Health,283,1

We aimed to investigate such during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: In three outpatient clinics, we hand-reviewed records of all patients having consulted us during a Study Period (90 days) in the early phase of the pandemic. Our inclusion criteria for Study Subjects were: (i) clear clinical diagnosis, (ii) dermoscopic confirmation, (iii) differential diagnoses excluded, (iv) eosinophilia, (v) protective gear worn during sanitation services, (vi) temporal correlation, (vii) distributional correlation, (viii) physician-assessed association, and (ix) patient-assessed association. Control Periods in the same season were elected. RESULTS: Twenty-five study subjects fulfilled all inclusion criteria. The incidence was significantly higher than in the control periods (IR: 3.57, 95% CI: 1.79-7.43). Male predominance was significant (P < 0.001). Such for patients in the control periods were insignificant. Study subjects were 21.2 (95% CI: 11.0-31.4) years younger than patients in the control periods. For the study subjects, the distribution of erythematous or skin-colored folliculocentric dome-shaped papules and pustules were all compatible with body parts covered by the gear. Lesional biopsy performed on two patients revealed eosinophilic dermal infiltrates within and around the pilosebaceous units. Polarized dermoscopy revealed folliculitis with peri-/interfollicular vascular proliferation. Lesion onsets were 6.4 (SD: 2.1) days after wearing gear. Remissions were 16.7 (SD: 7.5) days after ceasing to wear gear and treatments. CONCLUSIONS: Wearing protective gear in volunteered sanitizing works could be associated with eosinophilic folliculitis. Owing to the significant temporal and distributional correlations, the association might be causal.","Chuh, Antonio",Int J Dermatol,283,26

Although most COVID-19 cases are asymptomatic or involve mild upper respiratory tract symptoms, a significant number of patients develop severe or critical disease. Patients with severe COVID-19 commonly present with viral pneumonia that may progress to life-threatening acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Patients with COVID-19 are also predisposed to venous and arterial thromboses that are associated with a poorer prognosis. The present study identified the emergence of a low-density inflammatory neutrophil (LDN) population expressing intermediate levels of CD16 (CD16Int) in patients with COVID-19. These cells demonstrated proinflammatory gene signatures, activated platelets, spontaneously formed neutrophil extracellular traps, and enhanced phagocytic capacity and cytokine production. Strikingly, CD16Int neutrophils were also the major immune cells within the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, exhibiting increased CXCR3 but loss of CD44 and CD38 expression. The percentage of circulating CD16Int LDNs was associated with D-dimer, ferritin, and systemic IL-6 and TNF-&#945; levels and changed over time with altered disease status. Our data suggest that the CD16Int LDN subset contributes to COVID-19-associated coagulopathy, systemic inflammation, and ARDS.

Pro-inflammatory macrophage differentiation remains a process facilitating a broad array of disease pathologies, and has recently emerged as a potential target against cytokine storm in COVID19. Here, we perform a whole-genome CRISPR screen to identify essential nodes regulating CD14 expression in myeloid cells, using the differentiation of THP-1 cells as a starting point. This strategy uncovers many known pathways required for CD14 expression and regulating macrophage differentiation while additionally providing a list of novel targets either promoting or limiting this process. To speed translation of these results, we have then taken the approach of independently validating hits from the screen using well-curated small molecules. In this manner, we identify pharmacologically tractable hits that can either increase CD14 expression on non-differentiated monocytes or prevent CD14 upregulation during macrophage differentiation. An inhibitor for one of these targets, MAP2K3, translates through to studies on primary human monocytes, where it prevents upregulation of CD14 following M-CSF induced differentiation, and pro-inflammatory cytokine production in response to LPS. Therefore, this screening cascade has rapidly identified pharmacologically tractable nodes regulating a critical disease-relevant process.","Jimenez-Duran, Gisela; Luque-Martin, Rosario; Patel, Meghana; Koppe, Emma; Bernard, Sharon; Sharp, Catriona; Buchan, Natalie; Rea, Ceara; de Winther, Menno P J; Turan, Nil; Angell, Davina; Wells, Christine A; Cousins, Rick; Mander, Palwinder K; Masters, Seth L",EBioMedicine,283,16

One of the unprecedented challenges is defining the optimal therapy for those patients with severe pneumonia and systemic manifestations of COVID-19. The optimal therapy should be largely based on the pathogenesis of infections caused by this novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Since the onset of COVID-19, there have been many prepublications and publications reviewing the therapy of COVID-19 as well as many prepublications and publications reviewing the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. However, there have been no comprehensive reviews that link COVID-19 therapies to the pathogenic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2. To link COVID-19 therapies to pathogenic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2, we performed a comprehensive search through MEDLINE, PubMed, medRxiv, EMBASE, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Web of Science using the following keywords: COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, novel 2019 coronavirus, pathology, pathologic, pathogenesis, pathophysiology, coronavirus pneumonia, coronavirus infection, coronavirus pulmonary infection, coronavirus cardiovascular infection, coronavirus gastroenteritis, coronavirus autopsy findings, viral sepsis, endotheliitis, thrombosis, coagulation abnormalities, immunology, humeral immunity, cellular immunity, inflammation, cytokine storm, superantigen, therapy, treatment, therapeutics, immune-based therapeutics, antiviral agents, respiratory therapy, oxygen therapy, anticoagulation therapy, adjuvant therapy, and preventative therapy. Opinions expressed in this review also are based on personal experience as clinicians, authors, peer reviewers, and editors. This narrative review linking COVID-19 therapies with pathogenic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in six major therapeutic goals for COVID-19 therapy based on the pathogenic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2. These goals are listed below: 1. The first goal is identifying COVID-19 patients that require both testing and therapy. This is best accomplished with a COVID-19 molecular test from symptomatic patients as well as determining the oxygen saturation in such patients with a pulse oximeter. Whether a symptomatic respiratory illness is COVID-19, influenza, or another respiratory pathogen, an oxygen saturation less than 90% means that the patient requires medical assistance. 2. The second goal is to correct the hypoxia. This goal generally requires hospitalization for oxygen therapy; other respiratory-directed therapies such as prone positioning or mechanical ventilation are often used in the attempt to correct hypoxemia due to COVID-19. 3. The third goal is to reduce the viral load of SARS-CoV-2. Ideally, there would be an oral antiviral agent available such as seen with the use of oseltamivir phosphate for influenza. This oral antiviral agent should be taken early in the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Such an oral agent is not available yet. Currently, two options are available for reducing the viral load of SARS-CoV-2. These are post-Covid-19 plasma with a high neutralizing antibody titer against SARS-CoV-2 or intravenous remdesivir; both options require hospitalization. 4. The fourth goal is to identify and address the hyperinflammation phase often seen in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Currently, fever with an elevated C-reactive protein is useful for diagnosing this hyperinflammation syndrome. Low-dose dexamethasone therapy currently is the best therapeutic approach. 5. The fifth goal is to identify and address the hypercoagulability phase seen in many hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Patients who would benefit from anticoagulation therapy can be identified by a marked increase in d-dimer and prothrombin time with a decrease in fibrinogen. To correct this disseminated intravascular coagulation-like phase, anticoagulation therapy with low molecular weight heparin is preferred. Anticoagulation therapy with unfractionated heparin is preferred in COVID-19 patients with acute kidney injuries. 6. The last goal is prophylaxis for persons who are not yet infected. Potential supplements include vitamin D and zinc. Although the data for such supplements is not extremely strong, it can be argued that almost 50% of the population worldwide has a vitamin D deficiency. Correcting this deficiency would be beneficial regardless of any impact of COVID-19. Similarly, zinc is an important supplement that is important in one's diet regardless of any effect on SARS-CoV-2. As emerging therapies are found to be more effective against the SARS-CoV-2 pathogenic mechanisms identified, they can be substituted for those therapies presented in this review.","Stratton, Charles W; Tang, Yi-Wei; Lu, Hongzhou",J. med. virol,283,22

METHODS: A total of 132 patients with confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to a designated COVID-19 hospital in Wuhan, China from January 18, 2020 to February 26, 2020 were collected. The dynamic changes of blood SAA, CRP, PCT, WBC, Lymphocyte (L), PLT, CT imaging, and disease progression were studied. All patients completed at least twice laboratory data collection and clinical condition assessment at three time points indicated for this study; The length of hospital stay was longer than 14 days prior to February 26, 2020. RESULTS: COVID-19 patients had significantly increased SAA and CRP levels, while L count decreased, and PCT, WBC, and PLT were in the normal range. As disease progressed from mild to critically severe, SAA and CRP gradually increased, while L decreased, and PLT, WBC, and PCT had no significant changes; ROC curve analysis suggests that SAA/L, CRP, SAA, and L count are valuable in evaluating the severity of COVID-19 and distinguishing critically ill patients from mild ones; Patients with SAA consistently trending down during the course of disease have better prognosis, compared with the patients with SAA continuously rising; The initial SAA level is positively correlated with the dynamic changes of the serial CT scans. Patient with higher initial SAA level are more likely to have poor CT imaging. CONCLUSIONS: SAA and L are sensitive indicators in evaluating the severity and prognosis of COVID-19. Monitoring dynamic changes of SAA, combined with CT imaging could be valuable in diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19.","Li, Huan; Xiang, Xiaochen; Ren, Hongwei; Xu, Lingli; Zhao, Lisha; Chen, Xiaoqiong; Long, Hui; Wang, Qiang; Wu, Qingming",J Infect,283,14

This study assessed the attitudes, anxiety, and behavioral practices of university students in Jordan regarding COVID-19 during the early period of the infection (March 19-21, 2020) using a validated, self-administered survey questionnaire. Positive attitudes or low-risk practices were given 1 point, whereas negative attitudes or high-risk practices were scored 0. Percentages of the total score were used for categorizing data into negative attitudes or high-risk practices (&#8804; 60%), moderate attitudes or moderate-risk practices (60.01-80%), and positive attitudes or low-risk practices (> 80%). Generally, the university students displayed positive attitudes and low-risk practices toward preventing COVID-19, with an average score of 81.1% and 84.3%, respectively. Approximately two-thirds (69.1%) of the students showed a positive attitude toward COVID-19 seriousness, concern of contracting the virus, and the appropriate prevention measures, and low-risk practices (67.6%) toward preventing COVID-19 including implementation of social distancing and good hygiene. Female, older, medical, or postgraduate students practiced significantly more (P &#8804; 0.05) appropriate hygiene and social distancing behaviors toward COVID-19 than their counterparts of each group. More than two-thirds (69.2%) of the students were anxious that they might become infected with COVID-19. These results are important for health authorities to develop appropriate educational programs and protective health measures including good respiratory etiquette and handwashing practices, to enhance safer lifestyles and prevent COVID-19 transmission.","Olaimat, Amin N; Aolymat, Iman; Elsahoryi, Nour; Shahbaz, Hafiz M; Holley, Richard A",Am J Trop Med Hyg,283,21

During SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic activities performed in Abruzzo region (central Italy) several strains belonging to the B.1.177.75 lineage tested negative for the N gene but positive for the ORF1ab and S genes (+/+/- pattern) by the TaqPath COVID-19 CE-IVD RT-PCR Kit manufactured by Thermofisher. By sequencing, a unique mutation, synonymous 28948C > T, was found in the N-negative B.1.177.75 strains. Although we do not have any knowledge upon the nucleotide sequences of the primers and probe adopted by this kit, it is likely that N gene dropout only occurs when 28948C > T is coupled with 28932C > T, this latter present, in turn, in all B.1.177.75 sequences available on public databases. Furthermore, epidemiological analysis was also performed. The majority of the N-negative B.1.177.75 cases belonged to two clusters apparently unrelated to each other and both clusters involved young people. However, the phylogeny for sequences containing the (+/+/-) pattern strongly supports a genetic connection and one common source for both clusters. Though, genetic comparison suggests a connection rather than indicating the independent emergence of the same mutation in two apparently unrelated clusters. This study highlights once more the importance of sharing genomic data to link apparently unrelated epidemiological clusters and to, remarkably, update molecular tests.","Amato, Laura; Jurisic, Lucija; Puglia, Ilaria; Lollo, Valeria Di; Curini, Valentina; Torzi, Giuseppe; Girolamo, Arturo Di; Mangone, Iolanda; Mancinelli, Adamo; Decaro, Nicola; Calistri, Paolo; Giallonardo, Francesca Di; Lorusso, Alessio; D039,; Alterio, Nicola",Emerg Microbes Infect,283,0

Generalized linear mixed models and logistic mixed-effect models examined change over time for number of sexual partners, mood, and alcohol consumption. From February 29, 2020 to July 31, 2020, 177 MSM actively engaged in PrEP care were evaluated. The median age was 37 [interquartile range (IQR 30, 51]. Patients in the sample were largely representative of the clinic population and identified as White (73.0%), Black/African American (9.2%), and other race (17.2%), and 11.8% identified as Hispanic/Latino ethnicity. Men reported an average of 2.60 fewer sexual partners (95% CI -4.04, -1.40) during the pandemic compared to pre-COVID-19. Rates of depressive symptoms and alcohol use remained stable and few patients reported substance use. The reduced number of sexual partners may be explained by patients' efforts to reduce risk of exposure to COVID-19 and low rates of psychosocial symptoms may be indicative of only the highest functioning patients continuing to engage in care. Reductions in sexual partners may offset reduced engagement in care and help mitigate risk of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs).","Rogers, Brooke G; Tao, Jun; Darveau, Spencer C; Maynard, Michaela; Almonte, Alexi; Napoleon, Siena; Murphy, Matthew; Chan, Philip A",AIDS behav,283,23

Despite our rapidly advancing knowledge of immune memory to SARS-CoV-2, understanding how these responses translate into protection against reinfection at both the individual and population levels remains a major challenge. An ideal outcome following infection or after vaccination would be a highly protective and durable immunity that allows for the establishment of high levels of population immunity. However, current studies suggest a decay of neutralizing antibody responses in convalescent patients, and documented cases of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection are increasing. Understanding the dynamics of memory responses to SARS-CoV-2 and the mechanisms of immune control are crucial for the rational design and deployment of vaccines and for understanding the possible future trajectories of the pandemic. Here, we summarize our current understanding of immune responses to and immune control of SARS-CoV-2 and the implications for prevention of reinfection.","Cromer, D.; Juno, J.

Here, using a 5-year dataset of eukaryotic plankton DNA metabarcoding, we assess changes in biodiversity and net community production in this region. Our results show that sea-ice extent is a dominant factor influencing eukaryotic plankton community composition, biodiversity, and net community production. Species richness and evenness decline with an increase in sea surface temperature (SST). In regions with low SST and shallow mixed layers, the community was dominated by a diverse assemblage of diatoms and dinoflagellates. Conversely, less diverse plankton assemblages were observed in waters with higher SST and/or deep mixed layers when sea ice extent was lower. A genetic programming machine-learning model explained up to 80% of the net community production variability at the Western Antarctic Peninsula. Among the biological explanatory variables, the sea-ice environment associated plankton assemblage is the best predictor of net community production. We conclude that eukaryotic plankton diversity and carbon cycling at the Western Antarctic Peninsula are strongly linked to sea-ice conditions.","Lin, Yajuan; Moreno, Carly; Marchetti, Adrian; Ducklow, Hugh; Schofield, Oscar; Delage, Erwan; Meredith, Michael; Li, Zuchuan; Eveillard, Damien; Chaffron, Samuel; Cassar, Nicolas",Nat Commun,283,16

RESULTS: Of 1589 family doctors invited, 491 (31%) participated in the survey, including 242 (49%) from private sector. In all, 98% surveyed doctors continued to provide clinical services during the survey period, but reduced clinic service demands were observed in 45% private practices and 24% public clinics. Almost all wore masks during consultation and washed hands between or before patient contact. Significantly more private than public doctors (80% vs 26%, P<0.001) experienced difficulties in stocking personal protective equipment (PPE); more public doctors used guidelines to manage suspected patients. The main concern of the respondents was PPE shortage. Respondents appealed for effective public health interventions including border control, quarantine measures, designated clinic setup, and public education. CONCLUSION: Family doctors from public and private sectors demonstrated preparedness to serve the community from the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak with heightened infection control measures and use of guidelines.

Recent studies have reported the detrimental effects of the pandemic on neurosurgery residents in North America, Asia, and Italy. However, the impact of the pandemic on neurosurgical training in Latin America and Spain has not yet been reported. In the present report, we describe effects of COVID-19 on training and working conditions of neurosurgery residents in these countries. METHODS: An electronic survey with 33 questions was sent to neurosurgery residents between September 7, 2020 and October 7, 2020. Statistical analysis was made in SPSS version 25. RESULTS: A total of 293 neurosurgery residents responded. The median age was 29.47 ± 2.6 years, and 79% (n = 231) were male. Of respondents, 36.5% (n = 107) were residents training from Mexico; 42% surveyed reported COVID symptoms and 2 (0.7%) received intensive care unit care; 61.4% of residents had been tested for COVID and 21.5% had a positive result; 84% of the respondents mentioned persisted with the same workload (&#8805;70 hours per week) during the pandemic.

Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) has complex mechanical and thermogenic functions and paracrine actions via various cytokines released by it, which can have both pro- and anti-inflammatory actions on myocardium and adjacent coronaries. The alteration of EAT gene expression in CAD is speculated, but poorly understood. This study was undertaken to find out the difference in gene expression of epicardial fat in CAD and non-CAD patients. Methods: Twenty seven patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and 16 controls (non-CAD patients undergoing valvular heart surgeries) were included in the study and their EAT samples were obtained. Gene expressions of uncoupling protein-1, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), adiponectin, adenosine A1 receptor (ADORA-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-&#945;) were studied by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Glucose, insulin, lipid profile, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, homocysteine, vitamin D, TNF-&#945; and leptin levels were estimated in fasting blood samples and analyzed. Results: Leptin levels were significantly higher in CABG group as compared to controls (P <0.05), whereas other metabolic parameters were not significantly different between the two groups. MCP-1, VCAM-1 and TNF-&#945; were upregulated in the CABG group as compared to controls. Further, multivariate analysis showed significantly reduced adjusted odds ratio for MCP-1 [0.27; 95% confidence interval: 0.08-0.91] in the CABG group as compared to controls (P <0.05). Interpretation & conclusions: Our findings showed an alteration in EAT gene expression in CAD patients with significant upregulation of MCP-1. Further studies with a large sample need to be done to confirm these findings.","Sahasrabuddhe, Anagha Vinay; Pitale, Shailesh U; Sivanesan, Saravana Devi; Deshpande, Purushottam K; Deshpande, Swapnil P; Daiwile, Atul",Indian J Med Res,283,32

Infection by human corona viruses highly depends on host microRNA (miR) involved in regulation of host innate immune response and inflammation-modulatory miR-146a is among the first miRs induced by immune reaction to a virus. Moreover, recent analysis showed that miR-146 is predicted to target at the SARS-CoV-2 genome. As the dominant regulator of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) downstream signaling, miR-146a may limit excessive inflammatory response to virus. Downregulation of circulating miR-146a was found in diabetes, obesity and hypertension and it is reflected by enhanced inflammation and fibrosis, systemic effects accompanying severe COVID-19. Thus it could be hypothesized that miR-146a deficiency may contribute to severe COVID-19 state observed in diabetes, obesity and hypertension but further investigations are needed.","Roganovic, Jelena",Med Hypotheses,283,24

The study was aimed to explore the association between ivermectin prophylaxis and the development of SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare workers. METHODS: A hospital-based matched case-control study was conducted among healthcare workers of AIIMS Bhubaneswar, India, from September to October 2020. Profession, gender, age and date of diagnosis were matched for 186 case-control pairs. Cases and controls were healthcare workers who tested positive and negative, respectively, for COVID-19 by RT-PCR. Exposure was defined as the intake of ivermectin and/or hydroxychloroquine and/or vitamin-C and/or other prophylaxis for COVID-19. Data collection and entry was done in Epicollect5, and analysis was performed using STATA version 13. Conditional logistic regression models were used to describe the associated factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: Ivermectin prophylaxis was taken by 76 controls and 41 cases. Two-dose ivermectin prophylaxis (AOR 0.27, 95% CI, 0.15-0.51) was associated with a 73% reduction of SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare workers for the following month. Those involved in physical activity (AOR 3.06 95% CI, 1.18-7.93) for more than an hour/day were more likely to contract SARS-CoV-2 infection. Type of household, COVID duty, single-dose ivermectin prophylaxis, vitamin-C prophylaxis and hydroxychloroquine prophylaxis were not associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. CONCLUSION: Two-dose ivermectin prophylaxis at a dose of 300 µg/kg with a gap of 72 hours was associated with a 73% reduction of SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare workers for the following month.

A teleproctoring concept using optical see-through head-mounted displays with a proctor's ability to see and, more important, virtually interact in the operator's visual field is presented. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Test conditions were created for simulated proctoring using a bifurcation aneurysm flow model for WEB device deployment. The operator in the angiography suite wore a Magic Leap-1 optical see-through head-mounted display to livestream his or her FOV to a proctor's computer in an adjacent building. A Web-based application (Spatial) was used for the proctor to virtually interact in the operator's visual space. Tested elements included the quality of the livestream, communication, and the proctor's ability to interact in the operator's environment using mixed reality. A hotspot and a Wi-Fi-based network were tested. RESULTS: The operator successfully livestreamed the angiography room environment and his FOV of the monitor to the remotely located proctor. The proctor communicated and guided the operator through the procedure over the optical see-through head-mounted displays, a process that was repeated several times. The proctor used mixed reality and virtual space sharing to successfully project images, annotations, and data in the operator's FOV for highlighting any device or procedural aspects. The livestream latency was 0.71 (SD, 0.03) seconds for Wi-Fi and 0.86 (SD, 0.3) seconds for the hotspot (P = .02). The livestream quality was subjectively better over the Wi-Fi. CONCLUSIONS: New technologies using head-mounted displays and virtual space sharing could offer solutions applicable to remote proctoring in the neurointerventional space.","Rai, A T; Deib, G; Smith, D; Boo, S",AJNR Am J Neuroradiol,283,24

DESIGN: Survey of cases. PARTICIPANTS: The study included Québec HCWs from private and public institutions with laboratory-confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) diagnosed between March 1 and June 14, 2020. HCWs aged &#8805;18 years who worked during the exposure period and survived their illness were eligible for the survey. METHODS: After obtaining consent, 4,542 HCWs completed a standardized questionnaire. COVID-19 rates and proportions of exposures and practices were estimated and compared between ACHs and LTCFs. RESULTS: HCWs represented 13,726 (25%) of 54,005 reported COVID-19 cases in Québec and had an 11-times greater rate of COVID-19 than non-HCWs. Their secondary household attack rate was 30%. Most affected occupations were healthcare support workers, nurses and nurse assistants working in LTCFs (45%) and ACHs (30%). Compared to ACHs, HCWs in LTCFs had less training, higher staff mobility between working sites, similar PPE use, and better self-reported compliance with at-work physical distancing. Suboptimal IPC practices declined over time but were still present at the end of the first wave. CONCLUSION: Québec HCWs and their families were severely affected during the first wave of COVID-19. Insufficient pandemic preparedness and suboptimal IPC practices likely contributed to high transmission in both LTCFs and ACHs.","Carazo, Sara; Laliberté, Denis; Villeneuve, Jasmin; Martin, Richard; Deshaies, Pierre; Denis, Geoffroy; Adib, Georges; Tissot, France; Dionne, Marc; De Serres, Gaston",Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,283,29

Distancing directives are represented by rates of flow into these compartments, as well as by a reduction in contacts that lessens disease transmission. The dynamical behavior of this system is analyzed, under various different rate control strategies, and the sensitivity of the basic reproduction number to various parameters is studied. One of the striking features of this model is the existence of a critical implementation delay (CID) in issuing separation mandates: while a delay of about two weeks does not have an appreciable effect on the peak number of infections, issuing mandates even slightly after this critical time results in a far greater incidence of infection. Thus, there is a nontrivial but tight ""window of opportunity"" for commencing social distancing in order to meet the capacity of healthcare resources. However, if one wants to also delay the timing of peak infections -so as to take advantage of potential new therapies and vaccines- action must be taken much faster than the CID. Different relaxation strategies are also simulated, with surprising results. Periodic relaxation policies suggest a schedule which may significantly inhibit peak infective load, but that this schedule is very sensitive to parameter values and the schedule's frequency. Furthermore, we considered the impact of steadily reducing social distancing measures over time. We find that a too-sudden reopening of society may negate the progress achieved under initial distancing guidelines, but the negative effects can be mitigated if the relaxation strategy is carefully designed.","Gevertz, Jana L; Greene, James M; Sanchez-Tapia, Cynthia H; Sontag, Eduardo D",J Theor Biol,283,18

A significant part of the respondents believed that the COVID-19 pandemic affected the way they used social media. They pointed out that the most common social media use drivers were immediate needs, often of pragmatic nature, such as rapid communication and exchange of information, and social needs. Among the survey population, it was the women who were more active on social media, particularly regarding Instagram. They were also more active on Pinterest and Snapchat. Men were more active on YouTube. Extraverts published more often on Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, or Pinterest by a wide margin. They were also more active in general and more often judged social media content. The respondents indicated social platforms they believed would gain or lose popularity in the nearest future.

The objective of this study was to survey the use of smartphone-based medical apps among dentists in China and determine dentists' perceptions of such apps. METHODS: All data were collected using anonymous questionnaires. The questionnaires for this cross-sectional study were randomly sent to dentists by email, and 379 dentists responded. Dentists' demographics and perceptions of WeChat, QQ (the most popular social media apps in China) and other medical apps were assessed; the questionnaire including questions on the purpose, frequency, daily use, and opinion of the apps they used. Questions were answered using a Likert scale (1 = strongly agree, 2 = agree, 3 = not sure, 4 = disagree, and 5 = strongly disagree). RESULTS: A total of 379 valid responses were received; the respondents had a median age of 33.6 years old (63.3% female). All subjects (100%) owned a smartphone, and all of them installed and used WeChat or QQ in their clinical practice. Only 76% of subjects installed medical apps (other than WeChat and QQ) on their smartphones. Male dentists were more likely to install medical apps than female dentists (p < 0.05). With increasing age, the percentage of dentists who installed medical apps decreased (p < 0.001). The frequency and daily use were higher for WeChat and QQ than for medical apps. Medical apps were positively perceived, with dentists reporting that they recommend these medical apps to their peers (Likert score: 1.67 ± 0.68). CONCLUSION: Medical apps were perceived to have a positive impact on clinical practice, education and patient care in dentistry by providing relevant medical information. However, there will still be much room for improvement in the future.","Zhang, Chao; Fan, Lin; Chai, Zhaowu; Yu, Cong; Song, Jinlin",BMC Med Inform Decis Mak,283,24

As a southern hemisphere country like South Africa stands now as the most COVID-19 and HIV affected country in Africa, we use in this paper, recent COVID-19 data to provide a statistical and comparative analysis that may alert southern hemisphere countries entering the winter season. After that, we use a generalized simple mathematical model of HIV-COVID-19 together with graphs, curves and tables to compare the pandemic situation in countries that were once the epicenter of the disease, such as China, Italy, Spain, United Kingdom (UK) and United States of America (USA). We perform stability and bifurcation analysis and show that the model contains a forward and a backward bifurcation under certain conditions. We also study different scenarios of stability/unstability equilibria for the model. The fractional (generalized) COVID-19 model is solved numerically and a predicted prevalence for the COVID-19 is provided. Recall that Brazil and South Africa share number of similar social features like Favellas (Brazil) and Townships (South Africa) with issues like promiscuity, poverty, and where social distanciation is almost impossible to observe. We can now ask the following question: Knowing its HIV situation, is South Africa the next epicenter in weeks to come when winter conditions, proven to be favorable to the spread of the new coronavirus are comfily installed?","Doungmo Goufo, Emile F.; Khan, Yasir; Chaudhry, Qasim Ali",Chaos Solitons Fractals,283,10

This review summarizes food security during epidemics and pandemics before moving on to panic buying, food shortages, and price spikes observed during the current crisis. The importance of food resilience, together with the need for addressing issues related to food loss and food waste, is underlined in the review towards food security and sustainable development. As a result, the pandemic has shown that our food systems are fragile. Since the global population and urbanization will grow in the coming decades, pandemics will likely occur more often, and climate change will intensify. Consequently, there is a need to ensure that our food systems become more sustainable and resilient. To that end, we have highlighted the need to develop contingency plans and mitigation strategies that would allow a more rapid response to extreme events (e.g., disasters from climate change) and transform the food sector by making it more resilient.","BoyacÎ¹-Gündüz, Cennet Pelin; Ibrahim, Salam A; Wei, Ooi Chien; Galanakis, Charis M",,283,16

Human peripheral VÎ³9VÎ´2 T cells, which constitute a major transitional immunity lymphocyte subset, represent attractive candidates because of their broad and efficient anti-tumor functions, as well as their lack of alloreactivity and easy handling. VÎ³9VÎ´2 T cells act like immune cell stress sensors that can, in a tightly controlled manner but through yet incompletely understood mechanisms, detect subtle changes of levels of phosphorylated metabolites of isoprenoid synthesis pathways. Consequently, various anti-tumor immunotherapeutic strategies have been proposed to enhance their reactivity and cytotoxicity, as well as to reduce the deleterious events. In this review, we expose these advances based on different strategies and their validation in preclinical models. Importantly, we next discuss advantages and limits of each approach, by highlighting the importance of the use of relevant preclinical model for evaluation of safety and efficacy.

We performed this cross-sectional study to assess the levels and determinants of public KAP towards COVID-19 in a large, multinational sample. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study (survey). SETTING: The questionnaire was distributed to potential respondents via online platforms. PARTICIPANTS: 71 890 individuals from 22 countries. METHODS: We formulated a four-section questionnaire in English, followed by validation and translation into seven languages. The questionnaire was distributed (May to June 2020) and each participant received a score for each KAP section. RESULTS: Overall, the participants had fair knowledge (mean score: 19.24±3.59) and attitudes (3.72±2.31) and good practices (12.12±1.83) regarding COVID-19. About 92% reported moderate to high compliance with national lockdown. However, significant gaps were observed: only 68.2% knew that infected individuals may be asymptomatic; 45.4% believed that antibiotics are an effective treatment; and 55.4% stated that a vaccine has been developed (at the time of data collection). 71.9% believed or were uncertain that COVID-19 is a global conspiracy; 36.8% and 51% were afraid of contacting doctors and Chinese people, respectively. Further, 66.4% reported the pandemic had moderate to high negative effects on their mental health. Female gender, higher education and urban residents had significantly (p&#8804;0.001) higher knowledge and practice scores. Further, we observed significant correlations between all KAP scores. CONCLUSIONS: Although the public have fair/good knowledge and practices regarding COVID-19, significant gaps should be addressed.

The COVID-19 pandemic has seen a significant disruption in the provision of dental services globally. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on dental services provided in Australia through the Child Dental Benefits Schedule. METHODS: This study was a retrospective analysis of Medicare data on utilization of the Child Dental Benefits Schedule obtained from the Australian Government. Data were analysed for the period February to September 2020, with the number of services provided per month across five categories (diagnostic, preventive, restorative, endodontic and oral surgery) compared with the monthly average for 2019 (95% CI) and the same month for 2019. Total services by month were reported for 2017, 2018 and 2019 to compare the yearly trend with 2020. Differences in services provision by State/Territory were also described. RESULTS: Over the period of March to September, there were 881 454 fewer dental services provided in 2020 than 2019, with the largest decline seen in April. There was a greater decline in preventive and diagnostic services, and a smaller decline in endodontic and oral surgery services. A second wave of COVID-19 in Victoria saw 198 609 fewer dental services provided in that state from July to September 2020 than 2019. Dental service provision had still not returned to normal levels across Australia by September 2020. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the provision of dental services to children from lower socioeconomic backgrounds who already experience higher levels of dental disease and disadvantage in accessing dental care. Although the restriction of dental services was deemed necessary in order to minimize the risk of transmission of COVID-19 in the dental setting, the impact of these restrictions on oral health will be long lasting. Given the chronic and progressive nature of dental disease, the deferral of necessary dental care is likely to contribute to poorer oral health and long-term problems for many Australians.","Hopcraft, Matthew; Farmer, Glenda",Community dent. oral epidemiol,283,26

A total of 341 operations were included from the 31 days. Alongside data from the dispatch system, all operational documentation was assessed. Results: In 57% of cases, mNACA II patients (outpatient treatment) were identified, in 42% of cases, mNACA III patients (inpatient treatment) were identified, and in 1% of cases, mNACA IV (imminent danger to life) patients were identified. In 51% of cases, the emergency services transported the patient to a hospital, and in 49%, alternative care measures were employed. These included referral to a local physician in 28% of cases. In 11% of cases, patients were referred to on-call services of the Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians (KV in German). In 4% of cases, the Berlin Fire Department emergency dispatch center deployed a physician of the KV (KV-ARE investigator). Discussion: The results show that additional operational resources serve an important function during a pandemic with regards to an initial assessment and pilot function. This can help relieve not only the emergency services but also the medical facilities responsible for providing further care. The standardised dispatch enquiry enables the linking with the appropriate codes from the low-priority operational spectrum and support by a Tele-emergency physician lends additional professional competency to the emergency paramedics.","Breuer, F; Pommerenke, C; Ziemen, B; Stiepak, J-K; Poloczek, S; Dahmen, J",Notf Rett Med,283,13

METHOD: We designed and fielded an original representative survey of 3,000 American adults between March 20-23, 2020 to collect data on a battery of 38 health-related behaviors, government policy preferences on COVID-19 response and worries about the pandemic. We test for partisan differences COVID-19 related policy attitudes and behaviors, measured in three different ways: party affiliation, intended 2020 Presidential vote, and self-placed ideological positioning. Our multivariate approach adjusts for a wide range of individual demographic and geographic characteristics that might confound the relationship between partisanship and health behaviors, attitudes, and preferences. RESULTS: We find that partisanship-measured as party identification, support for President Trump, or left-right ideological positioning-explains differences in Americans across a wide range of health behaviors and policy preferences. We find no consistent evidence that controlling for individual news consumption, the local policy environment, and local pandemic-related deaths erases the observed partisan differences in health behaviors, beliefs, and attitudes. In further analyses, we use a LASSO regression approach to select predictors, and find that a partisanship indicator is the most commonly selected predictor across the 38 dependent variables that we study. CONCLUSION: Our analysis of individual self-reported behavior, attitudes, and policy preferences in response to COVID-19 reveals that partisanship played a central role in shaping individual responses in the earliest months of the COVID-19 pandemic. These results indicate that partisan differences in responding to a national public health emergency were entrenched from the earliest days of the pandemic.","Gadarian, Shana Kushner; Goodman, Sara Wallace; Pepinsky, Thomas B",PLoS One,283,16

Essential businesses, most prominently grocery stores, remained open to ensure access to food and household essentials. Grocery shopping presents increased potential for COVID-19 infection because customers and store employees are in proximity to each other. This study investigated shoppers' perceptions of COVID-19 infection risks and put them in context by comparing grocery shopping to other activities outside home, and examined whether a proactive preventive action by grocery stores influence shoppers' perceived risk of COVID-19 infection. Our data were obtained via an anonymous online survey distributed between April 2 and 10, 2020 to grocery shoppers in New York State (the most affected by the pandemic at the time of the study) and Washington State (the first affected by the pandemic). We found significant factors associated with high levels of risk perception on grocery shoppers. We identified some effective preventive actions that grocery stores implement to alleviate anxiety and risk perception. We found that people are generally more concerned about in-store grocery shopping relative to other out-of-home activities. Findings suggest that a strict policy requiring grocery store employees to use facemasks and gloves greatly reduced shoppers' perceived risk rating of infection of themselves by 37.5% and store employees by 51.2%. Preventive actions by customers and businesses are critical to reducing the unwitting transmission of COVID-19 as state governments prepare to reopen the economy and relax restrictions on activities outside home.","Li, Jie; Verteramo Chiu, Leslie J; Gómez, Miguel I; Bills, Nelson L",PLoS One,283,16

CASE SUMMARY: A 60-year-old man was diagnosed with left UC and was given azathioprine 2.5 mg/kg to control UC symptoms and decrease corticosteroid patient dependence. Four years later, he developed adverse reaction to azathioprine and began treatment with mercaptopurine 1.5 mg/kg/day. Despite this treatment, he developed a severe relapse (Truelove-Witts modified: 15 points). Treatment with IFX 5 mg/kg at weeks 0, 2, 6, and every 8 weeks was started. After 1 year in clinical remission, the patient developed an infusion reaction to IFX, and IFX was suspended. The patient started treatment with ADA 40 mg every other week. After 2 years in clinical remission, ADA was suspended. 20 months after ADA discontinuation, the patient developed an acute episode of UC with a Truelove-Witts modified score of 16 points. ADA plus corticosteroid therapy was restarted. Despite these treatments, the patient's clinical condition did not improved. ADA 40 mg per week was started with not clinical improvement and with corticosteroid dependence after 4 months of ADA intensive therapy. The patient denied surgery, and cyclosporine was discarded because of its inability to be used as a maintenance drug. The patient started GLB with an induction dosage regimen of 200 mg subcutaneous at week 0, followed by 100 mg at week 2, and then maintenance therapy with 100 mg every 4 weeks (patient's weight = 84 kg), combined with mercaptopurine and corticosteroids. After 6 weeks of treatment, the patient achieved clinical remission, with just three non-bleeding stools per day, without stomach ache, apyretic, and no urgency or tenesmus rectal symptoms. One year later, the patient continued to be asymptomatic with a Truelove-Witts modified score of 2 points, corticoid-free treatment, and a complete clinical and endoscopic remission and normal calprotectin levels (< 15 µg/g). We decided to suspend mercaptopurine in order to avoid side effects derived from the combined treatment. After 1 year on GLB therapy, the patient continued in clinical remission. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our case, GLB could be selected as an effective approach for patients with UC refractory to IFX and ADA. However, further studies need to be performed to evaluate the efficacy of GLB therapy as a rescue treatment.","Cortes, Xavier; Borrás-Blasco, Joaquín; Flor, Laura; Antequera, Beatríz; Fernandez-Martinez, Sergio; Molés, Jose Ramón; Casterá, Elvira",Int. j. clin. pharmacol. ther,283,10

DESIGN: A regression discontinuity in time (RDiT) analysis of daily service-level activity. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Mental healthcare data were extracted from 10 UK providers. OUTCOME MEASURES: Daily (weekly for one site) deaths from all causes, referrals and discharges, inpatient care (admissions, discharges, caseloads) and community services (face-to-face (f2f)/non-f2f contacts, caseloads): Adult, older adult and child/adolescent mental health; early intervention in psychosis; home treatment teams and liaison/Accident and Emergency (A&E). Data were extracted from 1 Jan 2019 to 31 May 2020 for all sites, supplemented to 31 July 2020 for four sites. Changes around the commencement and lifting of COVID-19 'lockdown' policy (23 March and 10 May, respectively) were estimated using a RDiT design with a difference-in-difference approach generating incidence rate ratios (IRRs), meta-analysed across sites. RESULTS: Pooled estimates for the lockdown transition showed increased daily deaths (IRR 2.31, 95% CI 1.86 to 2.87), reduced referrals (IRR 0.62, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.70) and reduced inpatient admissions (IRR 0.75, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.83) and caseloads (IRR 0.85, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.91) compared with the pre lockdown period. All community services saw shifts from f2f to non-f2f contacts, but varied in caseload changes. Lift of lockdown was associated with reduced deaths (IRR 0.42, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.66), increased referrals (IRR 1.36, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.60) and increased inpatient admissions (IRR 1.21, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.42) and caseloads (IRR 1.06, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.12) compared with the lockdown period. Site-wide activity, inpatient care and community services did not return to pre lockdown levels after lift of lockdown, while number of deaths did. Between-site heterogeneity most often indicated variation in size rather than direction of effect.

A cross-sectional analysis among a representative sample of high school boys (n = 3672) from the 2015 Maine Integrated Youth Health Survey was conducted. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were obtained using logistic regression analyses while controlling for grade level, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, suicidal ideation, alcohol and marijuana use, and gun access. Among the sample, 3.3% reported carrying a gun to school at least one time in the previous 12-months, 9.5% reported experiencing gender-based bullying victimization, and 7% reported experiencing sexual orientation-based bullying victimization. Regression analyses indicated that adolescent boys who experienced gender-based bullying victimization (OR 3.40, 95% CI 1.64, 5.62, p < .001) or sexual orientation-based bullying victimization (OR 3.57, 95% CI 1.91, 6.67, p < .001) had greater odds of reporting they carried a gun to school while controlling for grade level, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, suicidal ideation, alcohol and marijuana use, and gun access. These results expand upon previous gun carrying and bullying research by identifying the specific type of the bullying experienced and have important implications for social workers and school personnel.

Of the 175/215 who reported contact with COVID-19 positive patients, 6/ 215 had a positive PCR result and 15/215 reported a positive antibody test. Only 3/6 that had a positive PCR test demonstrated antibodies. Conclusions: Our immunity rate of 7% is extremely low and is concerning especially in respect of the anticipated herd immunity which would mitigate many of the issues presently being confronted and it is likely to be many months at least before this makes realistic contribution. Continued testing for the presence of COVID-19 antibodies will contribute to crucial seroprevalence data that can be used by public health bodies whose advice will necessarily evolve as increasing data sets become available.","Isheerwood, J.; Winyard, J.; Bekhyat Karki, B.; Chung, W.

This review explores the evidence surrounding the importance of being born in the right unit, the advantages of in utero transfers compared to ex utero transfers, and how to accurately assess which women are at most risk of delivering early and the challenges of in utero transfers. Accurate identification of the women most at risk of preterm birth is key to prioritising who to transfer antenatally, but the administrative burden and pathway variation of in utero transfer in the UK are likely to compromise optimal clinical care. Women reported the impact that in utero transfers have on them, including the emotional and financial burdens of being transferred and the anxiety surrounding domestic and logistical concerns related to being away from home. The final section of the review explores new approaches to reforming the in utero transfer process, including learning from outside the UK and changing policy and guidelines. Examples of collaborative regional guidance include the recent Pan-London guidance on in utero transfers. Reforming the transfer process can also be aided through technology, such as utilising the CotFinder app. In utero transfer is an unavoidable aspect of maternity and neonatal care, and the burden will increase if preterm birth rates continue to rise in association with increased rates of multiple pregnancy, advancing maternal age, assisted reproductive technologies, and obstetric interventions. As funding and capacity pressures on health services increase because of the COVID-19 pandemic, better prioritisation and sustained multi-disciplinary commitment are essential to maximise better outcomes for babies born too soon.","Watson, Helena; McLaren, James; Carlisle, Naomi; Ratnavel, Nandiran; Watts, Tim; Zaima, Ahmed; Tribe, Rachel M; Shennan, Andrew H",F1000Research,283,26

Different mechanisms have been proposed for the pathogenesis of HF in COVID-19 ranging from direct viral injury to indirect immune mediated damage. Patients can have different clinical presentations with either acute heart failure or chronic heart failure. Early recognition and prompt management is the need of the hour to prevent any mortality and morbidity. Summary: COVID-19 can affect the heart in many ways. This article describes the mechanisms, clinical presentations and management of heart failure caused by COVID-19 infection.","Mani, Avinash; Ojha, Vineeta; Dubey, Manoj Kumar",J Assoc Physicians India,283,20

In 2017, urban neuropsychologists and a pediatrician practicing in a rural region of New Mexico started to develop a teleneuropsychology (TeleNP) consultation service model to efficiently triage and determine a clinical course of action. This pilot project, aimed at expanding clinical access to specialized pediatric services in rural areas, evolved over the course of 2 years prior to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. METHOD: Providers earned the trust of the local community, gained understanding of pertinent sociocultural factors, and acquired knowledge of the clinical and educational concerns for the children residing in the rural community. The application of a culturally informed approach that highlights the importance of community participation and collaboration steered the decision to implement a TeleNP consultation model. By widening access to neuropsychology, this service helped to determine whether neuropsychological testing procedures were medically indicated. RESULTS: We summarize the distinct processes that needed to occur at each location to support the implementation of telemedicine. We propose a clinical service decision tree with specific criteria to help guide providers on how to triage cases in order to increase access to specialized healthcare. CONCLUSION: The success of implementing a TeleNP consultation service hinges upon ongoing care coordination between providers, clerical staff, patients, and families with clear goals and expectations, maintenance of legal and ethical standards, and development of specific administrative and clinical processes supporting the use of TeleNP.","Sherwood, Andrea R; MacDonald, Beatriz",Arch Clin Neuropsychol,283,12

This function is driven by neural interactions in the entorhinal cortical-hippocampal network, especially the neural input from the pyramidal cells in layer III of medial entorhinal cortex (MECIII) to hippocampal CA1 is crucial for TAL. Successful TAL depends on the strength of event stimuli and the duration of the temporal gap between events. Whereas it has been demonstrated that the neural input from pyramidal cells in layer II of MEC, referred to as Island cells, to inhibitory neurons in dorsal hippocampal CA1 controls TAL when the strength of event stimuli is weak, it remains unknown whether Island cells regulate TAL with long trace periods as well. To understand the role of Island cells in regulating the duration of the learnable trace period in TAL, we used Pavlovian trace fear conditioning (TFC) with a 60-sec long trace period (long trace fear conditioning [L-TFC]) coupled with optogenetic and chemogenetic neural activity manipulations as well as cell type-specific neural ablation. We found that ablation of Island cells in MECII partially increases L-TFC performance. Chemogenetic manipulation of Island cells causes differential effectiveness in Island cell activity and leads to a circuit imbalance that disrupts L-TFC. However, optogenetic terminal inhibition of Island cell input to dorsal hippocampal CA1 during the temporal association period allows for long trace intervals to be learned in TFC. These results demonstrate that Island cells have a critical role in regulating the duration of time bridgeable between associated events in TAL.","Yokose, Jun; Marks, William D; Yamamoto, Naoki; Ogawa, Sachie K; Kitamura, Takashi",Learn Mem,283,16

Accordant public policies often balance between retributive (punishment-based) and assistance (solidarity-based) measures to foster responsible behaviour. Yet, the uncontrolled spreading of the disease has divided public opinion about which measures are best suited, and it has made salient group disparities in behaviour, potentially straining intergroup relations, elevating heated emotions, and undercutting coordinated international responses. In a 2 × 2 between-subjects experiment, British citizens (N = 377) read about national in-group or outgroup members (categorical differentiation), who were either conforming to or deviating from the corona regulations (normative differentiation). Participants then reported moral emotions towards the target national group and indicated support for public policies. In general, support for assistance policies outweighed support for retributive measures. Second, however, norm deviation was associated with less positive and more negative moral emotions, the latter category further relating to more punitiveness and less assistance support. Finally, respondents who read about norm-violating outgroup members especially reported support for retributive measures, indicating that people might use norm deviation to justify outgroup derogation. We discuss implications for policymakers and formulate future research avenues.","Van Assche, Jasper; Politi, Emanuele; Van Dessel, Pieter; Phalet, Karen",Br J Soc Psychol,283,24

Major US news media provided information to the public about social distancing after COVID-19 was declared a pandemic, potentially spurring this preventative health practice. Using data from a representative sample of US residents, this study aims to understand the relationship between news media attention and social-distancing behavior via three potential mediators: perceived effectiveness of social distancing, perceived susceptibility to COVID-19 infection, and perceived negative consequences of infection. Media trust and social norms concerning social distancing were included as potential moderators of these relationships, along with political ideology. With multiple regression and mediation analyses, we found that news media attention was positively associated with social-distancing behavior during this period. Perceived effectiveness of social distancing mediated this relationship, while perceived susceptibility and negative consequences of COVID-19 did not. Notably, media trust negatively moderated news attention's impact on the perceived effectiveness of social distancing, with the relationship being more pronounced among those who have lower trust in media. Political ideology did not moderate the relationship between news attention and perceived effectiveness. Further, social norms negatively moderated the relationship between perceived effectiveness and social-distancing behavior, with this relationship growing stronger among those uncertain about the adoption of social-distancing norms in their circle. Overall, the study found news media to have an important role in promoting social-distancing behavior when they emphasized safety measures across the ideological spectrum.","Jiang, Xiaoya; Hwang, Juwon; Shah, Dhavan V; Ghosh, Shreenita; Brauer, Markus",Health Commun,283,24

METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed to examine the basic data, clinical characteristics and prognosis of patients with COVID-19 in Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University and Wuhan Fourth Hospital from January 1st to February 1st in 2020. According to the diagnostic criteria of Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO), patients with AKI were included in AKI group and those without AKI were included in non-AKI group. The differences of each index between the two groups were compared. The prognostic value of AKI for COVID-19 was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier survival curve and Cox regression. RESULTS: A total of 394 COVID-19 patients were included, with a total mortality of 5.6%; 37 (9.4%) of them developed AKI. The mortality of patients with COVID-19 associated AKI was 18.9%. There were significant differences in age, gender, smoking history, hypertension history, malignancy history, cardiovascular disease history and cerebrovascular disease history between the two groups. In addition to the difference of serum creatinine (SCr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), white blood cell count (WBC), neutrophil count (NEU), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), D-dimer, procalcitonin (PCT) and C-reaction protein (CRP) in AKI group were significantly higher than those in non-AKI group [WBC (×109/L): 5.75 (4.13, 7.83) vs. 4.52 (3.35, 5.90), NEU (×109/L): 4.55 (2.81, 6.11) vs. 3.06 (2.03, 4.50), AST (U/L): 40.0 (24.5, 69.5) vs. 30.0 (23.0, 42.5), LDH (µmol×s-1×L-1): 5.21 (3.68, 7.57) vs. 4.24 (3.05, 5.53), D-dimer (µg/L): 456 (266, 2 172) vs. 290 (152, 610), PCT (µg/L): 0.33 (0.03, 1.52) vs. 0.01 (0.01, 0.11), CRP (mg/L): 53.80 (26.00, 100.90) vs. 23.60 (9.25, 51.10), all P < 0.05], while lymphocyte count (LYM) and platelet count (PLT) were decreased [LYM (×109/L): 0.68 (0.47, 1.05) vs. 0.91 (0.63, 1.25), PLT (×109/L): 142.0 (118.0, 190.0) vs. 171.0 (130.0, 2 190.0), both P < 0.05]. The mortality of AKI group was significantly higher than that of non-AKI group [18.9% (7/37) vs. 4.2% (15/357), P < 0.01]. Kaplan-Meier survival curve showed that the 30-day cumulative survival of AKI group was lower than that of non-AKI group (log-rank: P = 0.003).

There is also a global pandemic of diabetes. It is caused by an insufficiency of the hormone insulin, which lowers blood glucose levels. Here we highlight recent work that addresses the question of how insulin is normally secreted from the β-cells of the pancreas and what goes wrong with this process in diabetes. We focus on the metabolic regulation of the ATP-sensitive potassium channel, an ATP-gated membrane pore that regulates insulin secretion. We show that when this pore is shut, insulin is released, and when it is open, insulin release is prevented. As may be expected, genetic mutations that impair the ability of ATP to close the channel cause neonatal diabetes. We also consider if a failure of β-cell metabolism to generate enough ATP to close the channel may lead to the progressive decline in β-cell function in type 2 diabetes. © 2021 The Authors.

While the medical community understands the mode of viral transmission, less is known about how long viral shedding occurs once viral symptoms have resolved. Our objective was to determine how long the SARS-CoV-2 remains detectable following self-reporting of viral symptom resolution. METHODS: This study was approved by the University of Wisconsin Institutional Review Board. A cohort of patients who were previously SARS-CoV-2 positive less than 28 days after self-reported symptom resolution were retested for proof of viral recovery by nasal swab reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. RESULTS: A total of 152 potential participants were screened, of which 5 declined, 54 were ineligible, and 93 were recruited; 86 of 93 completed testing. Eleven of 86 (13%) were still positive at a median of 19 days (range, 12-24 days) after symptom resolution. Positive participants were significantly older than negative participants (mean, 54 years; 95% confidence interval [CI], 44-63 vs 42 years; 95% CI, 38-46; P = .024). CT values were significantly, inversely associated with age (ß = -.04; r2 = 0.389; P = .04). The number of days since symptom recovery was not apparently different between positive and negative participants. CONCLUSION: We found evidence of persistent viral shedding in nasopharyngeal secretions more than 2 weeks after resolution of symptoms from confirmed COVID-19 infection. Persistent shedding was more common in older participants, and viral load was higher among older positive participants. These results underscore the necessity of testing COVID-19 convalescent plasma donors less than 28 days after symptom resolution.","Hartman, William R; Hess, Aaron S; Connor, Joseph P",Transfusion,283,6

Early results of the MonarchE trial investigating the addition of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitor abemaciclib to standard adjuvant endocrine therapy indicated a lower recurrence rate in the combination group in a high-risk population of patients with early stage hormone receptor (HR)-positive/HER2-negative BC. In contrast, the PALLAS study evaluating adjuvant palbociclib could not confirm these results. Subtle differences in the respective trial populations, a higher discontinuation rate in PALLAS, or substance-specific differences may be responsible. In HER2-positive early stage BC, long-term results of the ADAPT-TP trial support the notion that chemotherapy-free treatment may be possible in a subset of patients with favourable response to HER2-directed therapy without compromising long-term outcome. The phase III IMpassion031 trial evaluated the addition of atezolizumab to neoadjuvant anthracycline/taxane-containing chemotherapy in triple-negative BC (TNBC). A significant improvement in terms of pathologic complete remission rate was observed but data concerning long-term outcome must be awaited. Final overall survival (OS) analysis of IMpassion130 confirmed the clinically relevant OS improvement observed with the addition of atezolizumab to first-line nab-paclitaxel in metastatic PD-L1 positive TNBC. In contrast, no benefit was observed with the addition of atezolizumab to solvent-based paclitaxel in a similar population. This contradiction is commonly explained by the need for corticosteroid co-medication with conventional paclitaxel, but the exact reason remains poorly understood. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have been successfully established in HER2-positive breast cancer; in TNBC, the phase III ASCENT trial compared the ADC sacituzumab govitecan with chemotherapy by physician's choice in pretreated metastatic patients. A significant improvement in terms of progression-free survival and OS was observed rendering this drug a potential novel standard in this patient population.","Bartsch, Rupert",Memo,283,32

Outpatients from the US were enrolled remotely via internet-based surveys and followed up for 21 days. Eligible participants had a positive SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic test result (nucleic acid amplification or antigen) within 7 days prior to enrollment, were aged 18 years or older, and were not hospitalized at the time of enrollment. Among 604 individuals screened, 297 were ineligible, 44 refused participation, and 263 were enrolled. Participants, investigators, and study staff were masked to treatment randomization. Interventions: Participants were randomized in a 2:1 fashion to a single oral 1.2-g dose of azithromycin (n = 171) or matching placebo (n = 92). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was absence of self-reported COVID-19 symptoms at day 14. There were 23 secondary clinical end points, including all-cause hospitalization at day 21. Results: Among 263 participants who were randomized (median age, 43 years; 174 [66%] women; 57% non-Hispanic White and 29% Latinx/Hispanic), 76% completed the trial. The trial was terminated by the data and safety monitoring committee for futility after the interim analysis. At day 14, there was no significant difference in proportion of participants who were symptom free (azithromycin: 50%; placebo: 50%; prevalence difference, 0%; 95% CI, -14% to 15%; P > .99). Of 23 prespecified secondary clinical end points, 18 showed no significant difference. By day 21, 5 participants in the azithromycin group had been hospitalized compared with 0 in the placebo group (prevalence difference, 4%; 95% CI, -1% to 9%; P = .16). Conclusions and Relevance: Among outpatients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, treatment with a single dose of azithromycin compared with placebo did not result in greater likelihood of being symptom free at day 14. These findings do not support the routine use of azithromycin for outpatient SARS-CoV-2 infection.

470951,470951,470951,Speculations on the post-pandemic university campus – a global inquiry,15.344852,2.4049447,2021,"BACKGROUND: Accurate antibody tests are essential to monitor the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Lateral flow immunoassays (LFIAs) can deliver testing at scale. However, reported performance varies, and sensitivity analyses have generally been conducted on serum from hospitalised patients. For use in community testing, evaluation of finger-prick self-tests, in non-hospitalised individuals, is required. METHODS: Sensitivity analysis was conducted on 276 non-hospitalised participants. All had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcription PCR and were &#8805;21 days from symptom onset. In phase I, we evaluated five LFIAs in clinic (with finger prick) and laboratory (with blood and sera) in comparison to (1) PCR-confirmed infection and (2) presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies on two 'in-house' ELISAs. Specificity analysis was performed on 500 prepandemic sera. In phase II, six additional LFIAs were assessed with serum. FINDINGS: 95% (95% CI 92.2% to 97.3%) of the infected cohort had detectable antibodies on at least one ELISA. LFIA sensitivity was variable, but significantly inferior to ELISA in 8 out of 11 assessed. Of LFIAs assessed in both clinic and laboratory, finger-prick self-test sensitivity varied from 21% to 92% versus PCR-confirmed cases and from 22% to 96% versus composite ELISA positives. Concordance between finger-prick and serum testing was at best moderate (kappa 0.56) and, at worst, slight (kappa 0.13). All LFIAs had high specificity (97.2%-99.8%). INTERPRETATION: LFIA sensitivity and sample concordance is variable, highlighting the importance of evaluations in setting of intended use. This rigorous approach to LFIA evaluation identified a test with high specificity (98.6% (95%CI 97.1% to 99.4%)), moderate sensitivity (84.4% with finger prick (95% CI 70.5% to 93.5%)) and moderate concordance, suitable for seroprevalence surveys.","Flower, Barnaby; Brown, Jonathan C; Simmons, Bryony; Moshe, Maya; Frise, Rebecca; Penn, Rebecca; Kugathasan, Ruthiran; Petersen, Claire; Daunt, Anna; Ashby, Deborah; Riley, Steven; Atchison, Christina Joanne; Taylor, Graham P; Satkunarajah, Sutha; Naar, Lenny; Klaber, Robert; Badhan, Anjna; Rosadas, Carolina; Khan, Maryam; Fernandez, Natalia; Sureda-Vives, Macià; Cheeseman, Hannah M; O039,; Hara, Jessica; Fontana, Gianluca; Pallett, Scott J C; Rayment, Michael; Jones, Rachael; Moore, Luke S P; McClure, Myra O; Cherepanov, Peter; Tedder, Richard; Ashrafian, Hutan; Shattock, Robin; Ward, Helen; Darzi, Ara; Elliot, Paul; Barclay, Wendy S; Cooke, Graham S",Thorax,283,1

We herein examined LUS patterns in relation to disease severity and disease stage among patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: We performed a retrospective case series analysis of patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who were admitted to the hospital because of pneumonia. We recorded history, clinical parameters and medications. LUS was performed and scored in a standardized fashion by experienced operators, with evaluation of up to 12 lung fields, reporting especially on B-lines and consolidations. RESULTS: We included 96 patients, 58.3% men, with a mean age of 65.9 years. Patients with a high-risk quick COVID-19 severity index (qCSI) were older and had worse outcomes, especially for the need for high-flow oxygen. B-lines and consolidations were located mainly in the lower posterior lung fields. LUS patterns for B-lines and consolidations were significantly worse in all lung fields among patients with high versus low qCSI. B-lines and consolidations were worse in the intermediate disease stage, from day 7 to 13 after onset of symptoms. While consolidations correlated more with inflammatory biomarkers, B-lines correlated more with end-organ damage, including extrapulmonary involvement. CONCLUSIONS: LUS patterns provide a comprehensive evaluation of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia that correlated with severity and dynamically reflect disease stage. LUS patterns may reflect different pathophysiological processes related to inflammation or tissue damage; consolidations may represent a more specific sign of localized disease, whereas B-lines seem to be also dependent upon generalized illness due to SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Senter, Riccardo; Capone, Federico; Pasqualin, Stefano; Cerruti, Lorenzo; Molinari, Leonardo; Fonte Basso, Elisa; Zanforlin, Nicolò; Previato, Lorenzo; Toffolon, Alessandro; Sensi, Caterina; Arcidiacono, Gaetano; Gorgi, Davide; Ippolito, Renato; Nessi, Enrico; Pettenella, Pietro; Cellini, Andrea; Fossa, Claudio; Vania, Eleonora; Gardin, Samuele; Sukthi, Andi; Luise, Dora; Giordani, Maria Teresa; Zanatta, Mirko; Savino, Sandro; Cianci, Vito; Sattin, Andrea; Maria, Anna; Vianello, Andrea; Pesavento, Raffaele; Giannini, Sandro; Avogaro, Angelo; Vettor, Roberto; Fadini, Gian Paolo; Saller, Alois",,283,16

We recruited sexual and gender minority men using online networking apps from April 18-24, 2020 to enroll a longitudinal cohort. We analyzed baseline qualitative data from open-ended responses using content analysis to examine how the HIV/AIDS epidemic has helped sexual minority men with the current COVID-19 pandemic. Of the 437 participants who completed the survey, 155 (35%) indicated that HIV/AIDS had helped them cope with COVID-19. Free-response data from those 135 of those participants clustered around four themes: (1) experience having lived through a pandemic, (2) experience coping with stigma, (3) familiarity with public health protocols, and (4) belief in collective action. Based on the experiences of these men, public health approaches centered on resilience and collective action could be particularly helpful in responding and coping with COVID-19-especially if the pandemic persists over longer periods of time.","Quinn, Katherine G; Walsh, Jennifer L; John, Steven A; Nyitray, Alan G",AIDS behav,283,16

Because HCoV-OC43 uses cell-surface transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) for cell entry, VeroE6 cells expressing TMPRSS2 may show a clear CPE after HCoV-OC43 infection. The aim of this study was to construct a 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) assay for HCoV-OC43 based on CPE evaluation using VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells. VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells showed clear CPEs 3 to 4 days after low-titer HCoV-OC43 infection. Evaluation of viral kinetics indicated that the viral titer in the culture supernatant of VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells in the early stages of infection was higher than that of other cells. In comparison, between the CPE-based and the IPA-based (i.e., the reference titer) methods, the titer measured with CPE evaluation 4 to 5 days after infection using VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells showed a much smaller difference from the reference titer than that measured using other cells. Thus, the TCID50 assay using CPE evaluation with VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells provides the correct titer value and will greatly contribute to future research on HCoV-OC43.IMPORTANCE HCoV-OC43 rarely shows a cytopathic effect (CPE) in infected cell lines, and thus the plaque and TCID50 assays by CPE observation are not applicable for titration; the indirect immunoperoxidase assay (IPA) is used instead. However, the IPA is relatively complex, time-consuming, costly, and not suitable for simultaneous titration of many samples. We developed a TCID50 assay using CPE evaluation with TMPRSS2-expressing VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells that provides the same accuracy as the conventional IPA-based viral titration and does not require any staining procedures using antibodies or substrates. This titration method will greatly contribute to future research on HCoV-OC43 by allowing simple, low-cost, and accurate titration of this virus.","Hirose, Ryohei; Watanabe, Naoto; Bandou, Risa; Yoshida, Takuma; Daidoji, Tomo; Naito, Yuji; Itoh, Yoshito; Nakaya, Takaaki",MSphere,283,24

Here we generated single-cell atlases of 24 lung, 16 kidney, 16 liver and 19 heart autopsy tissue samples and spatial atlases of 14 lung samples from donors who died of COVID-19. Integrated computational analysis uncovered substantial remodelling in the lung epithelial, immune and stromal compartments, with evidence of multiple paths of failed tissue regeneration, including defective alveolar type 2 differentiation and expansion of fibroblasts and putative TP63+ intrapulmonary basal-like progenitor cells. Viral RNAs were enriched in mononuclear phagocytic and endothelial lung cells, which induced specific host programs. Spatial analysis in lung distinguished inflammatory host responses in lung regions with and without viral RNA. Analysis of the other tissue atlases showed transcriptional alterations in multiple cell types in heart tissue from donors with COVID-19, and mapped cell types and genes implicated with disease severity based on COVID-19 genome-wide association studies.

METHODS: Sixty-five patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia were evaluated in the sixth month after discharge from the hospital. Spirometry, 6 min walking test (6MWT), and short form of health-related quality of life scale (SF-36) were applied in the sixth month. Chest computed tomography (CT) was performed and the findings were grouped according to lung involvement. RESULTS: Forty-nine male and 16 female patients were included in the study. Forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1)% values of 18 patients (30.5%), forced vital capacity (FVC)% values of 27 patients (45.8%), and 6MWT of 13 patients (23.2%) were found lower than expected in the sixth month. On the SF-36 scale, physical function, energy-vitality, social functionality, pain, and general health parameters were found lower than normal. Minimal interstitial changes in chest CT were seen in 26 patients. Nine patients had lung area involvement between 10% and 50% of the surface, there was a correlation between FEV1% and FVC% values in this group. There was severe pulmonary fibrosis in four patients. There was a correlation between pulmonary function and physical function and general perception of health from SF-36 scale subparameters. CONCLUSION: Functional and radiological abnormalities were detected in a significant number of patients in the sixth month after severe COVID-19 pneumonia. A systematic monitoring plan must be established to assess and properly manage the long-term problems that may arise.","Bardakci, Mustafa Ilteris; Ozturk, Esin Nagihan; Ozkarafakili, Mufide Arzu; Ozkurt, Huseyin; Yanc, Ugur; Yildiz Sevgi, Dilek",J. med. virol,283,26

Cancer patients are at risk for infection exposure and serious complications. A prompt diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is crucial for the timely adoption of isolation measures and the appropriate management of cancer treatments. In lung cancer patients the symptoms of infection 19 may resemble those exhibited by the underlying oncologic condition, possibly leading to diagnostic overlap and delays. Moreover, cancer patients might display a prolonged positivity of nasopharyngeal RT-PCR assays for SARS-CoV-2, causing long interruptions or delay of cancer treatments. However, the association between the positivity of RT-PCR assays and the patient's infectivity remains uncertain. We describe the case of a patient with non-small cell lung cancer, and a severe ab extrinseco compression of the trachea, whose palliative radiotherapy was delayed because of the prolonged positivity of nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2. The patient did not show clinical symptoms suggestive of active infection, but the persistent positivity of RT-PCR assays imposed the continuation of isolation measures and the delay of radiotherapy for over two months. Finally, the negative result of SARS-CoV-2 viral culture allowed us to verify the absence of viral activity and to rule out the infectivity of the patient, who could finally continue her cancer treatment.","Ferrari, Anna; Trevenzoli, Marco; Sasset, Lolita; Di Liso, Elisabetta; Tavian, Toni; Rossi, Lucia; Di Meco, Eugenia; Cattelan, Anna Maria",Curr Oncol,283,32

Nevertheless, the COVID-19 pandemic led to a drastic reduction in routine clinical activities and a consequent risk of looser connections between LVAD patients and their referring center. Potential deleterious effects of such a situation can be a delayed recognition of LVAD-related complications, misdiagnosis of COVID-19, and impaired social and psychological well-being for patients and families. As one of the largest LVAD programs worldwide, we designed a sustainable and enforceable telemonitoring algorithm which can be easily adapted to every LVAD center so as to maintain optimal quality of care for LVAD patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Mariani, Silvia; Hanke, Jasmin S; Dogan, Günes; Schmitto, Jan D",Artif Organs,283,20

During quarantine, health monitoring, mental health assessments and psychosocial support were provided. All repatriates completed 14 days of quarantine. One person developed symptoms consistent with COVID-19 during quarantine but tested negative. Overall health operations were considered a success despite logistical and resource challenges. Lessons learnt were documented during a health sector after-action review held on 22 July 2020. Key recommendations for improvement were to obtain timely receipt of repatriate information before travel, limit the number of repatriates received and avoid the mixing of ""travel cohorts,"" ensure sufficient human resources are available to support operations while maintaining other essential services, establish a command and control structure for health operations, develop training packages and deliver them to all personnel supporting operations, and coordinate better with other sectors to ensure health aspects are considered.

Integrating sensing functionality is emerging as a key feature of the 6G Radio Access Network (RAN), allowing to exploit the dense cell infrastructure of 5G for constructing a perceptive network. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview on the background, range of key applications and state-of-the-art approaches of Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC). We commence by discussing the interplay between sensing and communications (S&C) from a historical point of view, and then consider multiple facets of ISAC and its performance gains. By introducing both ongoing and potential use cases, we shed light on industrial progress and standardization activities related to ISAC. We analyze a number of performance tradeoffs between S&C, spanning from information theoretical limits, tradeoffs in physical layer performance, to the tradeoff in cross-layer designs. Next, we discuss signal processing aspects of ISAC, namely ISAC waveform design and receive signal processing. As a step further, we provide our vision on the deeper integration between S&C within the framework of perceptive networks, where the two functionalities are expected to mutually assist each other, i.e., communication-assisted sensing and sensing-assisted communications. Finally, we summarize the paper by identifying the potential integration between ISAC and other emerging communication technologies, and their positive impact on the future of wireless networks.","Liu, Fan; Cui, Yuanhao; Masouros, Christos; Xu, Jie; Han, Tony Xiao; Eldar, Yonina C.; Buzzi, Stefano",,283,14

Multilevel models were used to compare trajectories of psychological distress, perceived stress, and loneliness among ED groups. Results Individuals with EDs and unsure EDs had higher levels of psychological distress, perceived stress and loneliness compared to those without EDs. Those unsure about their EDs showed initial decreases in perceived stress and loneliness, but started increasing again after some time. Levels of loneliness among those with EDs increased initially but later began to decrease;individuals with EDs showed steady decreases in perceived stress. Limitations Type, severity, and duration of EDs were unspecified in the self-reported measure of EDs, which could differentiate the trajectories of outcomes. Conclusions Intervention is crucial for mitigating mental health problems among those with ED symptoms during COVID-19. Further, results showed that individuals who are unsure about their ED status may be experiencing more fluctuation in mental health across the pandemic.","Kim, Sharon Wang Wei-Lin Mason Tyler",Journal of Affective Disorders Reports,283,10

To protect against the COVID-19 pandemic, the World Health Organization proposed intervening guidance that included movement restrictions, isolation, restriction of national and international travel or movement, and full or partial closure of organizations and institutions. Police personnel play a vital role in safeguarding the spread of COVID-19; thus, potentially causing severe stress due to increased consignment and direct exposure to infection during duty. The study aimed to determine the effect of the added stress of the COVID-19 pandemic and population lockdown on the sleep/wake 24 h rhythm of traffic police. A concise online questionnaire survey was conducted among the traffic police personnel of India. Collected data were analyzed statistically. Disorientation of working schedule, fear of being vulnerable to disease, pressure of maintaining law, and orders during lockdown increased stress level. The survey identified discontinuation of sleep, shift of mid-sleep time, increase in depression, plus stress and anxiety among traffic police personnel that affected their chronobiological milieu. Proper awareness of adequate health and safety measures, use of personnel protection equipment, regular conversation with family members, and meditation can help reduce stress during this pandemic situation.","Dey, Arindam; Majumdar, Piya; Saha, Atanu; Sahu, Subhashis",Chronobiol Int,283,16

METHODS: This was a national cohort study of patients with early BC undergoing multidisciplinary team (MDT)-guided treatment recommendations during the pandemic, designated 'standard' or 'COVID-altered', in the preoperative, operative and post-operative setting. FINDINGS: Of 3776 patients (from 64 UK units) in the study, 2246 (59%) had 'COVID-altered' management. 'Bridging' endocrine therapy was used (n = 951) where theatre capacity was reduced. There was increasing access to COVID-19 low-risk theatres during the study period (59%). In line with national guidance, immediate breast reconstruction was avoided (n = 299). Where adjuvant chemotherapy was omitted (n = 81), the median benefit was only 3% (IQR 2-9%) using 'NHS Predict'. There was the rapid adoption of new evidence-based hypofractionated radiotherapy (n = 781, from 46 units). Only 14 patients (1%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 during their treatment journey. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of 'COVID-altered' management decisions were largely in line with pre-COVID evidence-based guidelines, implying that breast cancer survival outcomes are unlikely to be negatively impacted by the pandemic.

While the number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 in Africa compared to other continents has so far been low, there are concerns about under-reporting, inadequate diagnostic tools, and insufficient treatment facilities. Moreover, proactiveness on the part of African governments has been under scrutiny. For instance, issues have emerged regarding the responsiveness of African countries in closing international borders to limit trans-continental transmission of the virus. Overdependence on imported products and outsourced services could have contributed to African governments' hesitation to shut down international air and seaports. In this era of emerging and re-emerging pathogens, we recommend that African nations should consider self-sufficiency in the health sector as an urgent priority, as this will not be the last outbreak to occur. In addition to the Regional Disease Surveillance Systems Enhancement fund (US$600 million) provided by the World Bank for strengthening health systems and disease surveillance, each country should further establish an epidemic emergency fund for epidemic preparedness and response. We also recommend that epidemic surveillance units should create a secure database of previous and ongoing pandemics in terms of aetiology, spread, and treatment, as well as financial management records. Strategic collection and analysis of data should also be a central focus of these units to facilitate studies of disease trends and to estimate the scale of requirements in preparation and response to any future pandemic or epidemic.","Oboh, Mary Aigbiremo; Omoleke, Semeeh Akinwale; Imafidon, Christian Eseigbe; Ajibola, Olumide; Oriero, Eniyou Cheryll; Amambua-Ngwa, Alfred",J Prev Med Public Health,283,24

SETTING: French refractive surgeons. DESIGN: Anonymous practice survey. METHODS: The questionnaire was sent in a single email invitation to 400 declared refractive surgeons. The following information was recorded between December 2019 and April 2020, before the coronavirus pandemic: demographics data, preoperative evaluation and preparation of the patient, surgical management, immediate and postoperative protocol, and infections reported after corneal refractive surgery. RESULTS: Eighty-three 83 of 400 surgeons (20.75%) responded to the questionnaire; 55 (66.0%) performed more than 50 corneal refractive surgeries a year, and 25 (30.1%) performed more than 200 procedures a year. Thirty-six (43.4%) surgeons wore 3 protective items, 37 (44.6%) 2, 5 (6.0%) 1, and 5 (6.0%) zero. Seventy-seven (92.8%) surgeons used povidone-iodine for skin area disinfection and 54 (65%) for conjunctival fornix disinfection. The contact time of povidone-iodine was less than 3 minutes for 71 (85.0%) surgeons. Twenty surgeons (24.1%) reported at least 1 post-refractive surgery infection. Twenty percent of surgeons who wore sterile gloves for PRK reported post-operative infections compared with 62.5% for those who did not (p=0.008). These figures were, respectively, 8.7% and 66.7% for the use of sterile gloves during LASIK (p=0.002); 8.9% of surgeons who wore surgical masks for LASIK reported postoperative infections compared with 50.0% for those who did not (p=0.01). CONCLUSION: Practices are variable among French refractive surgeons. Wearing a surgical mask and sterile gloves during corneal refractive surgery appears to be advisable.","Tourabaly, Moïse; Knoeri, Juliette; Leveziel, Loïc; Bouheraoua, Nacim; Ameline, Barbara; Borderie, Vincent",J. cataract. refract. surg,283,22

The current COVID-19 pandemic has led to increased adoption of telemedicine with national orthopaedic governing bodies advocating its use, as evidence suggests that social distancing maybe necessary until 2022. This systematic review aims to explore evidence for telemedicine in orthopaedics to determine its advantages, validity, effectiveness and utilisation. METHODS: Databases of PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus and CINAHL were systematically searched and articles were included if they involved any form of telephone or video consultation in an orthopaedic population. Findings were synthesised into four themes: patient/clinician satisfaction, accuracy and validity of examination, safety and patient outcomes and cost effectiveness. Quality assessment was undertaken using Cochrane and Joanna Briggs Institute appraisal tools. RESULTS: Twenty-one studies were included consisting of nine randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Studies revealed high patient satisfaction with telemedicine for convenience, less waiting and travelling time. Telemedicine was cost effective particularly if patients had to travel long distances, required hospital transport or time off work. No clinically significant differences were found in patient examination nor measurement of patient-reported outcome measures. Telemedicine was reported to be a safe method of consultation. DISCUSSION: Evidence suggests that telemedicine in orthopaedics can be safe, cost effective, valid in clinical assessment and with high patient/clinician satisfaction. However, more high-quality RCTs are required to elucidate long-term outcomes. This systematic review presents up-to-date evidence on the use of telemedicine and provides data for organisations considering its use in the current COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.","Haider, Zakir; Aweid, Bashaar; Subramanian, Padmanabhan; Iranpour, Farhad",J Telemed Telecare,283,20

Factors that influence health disparities in this population include inadequate dissemination of culturally and linguistically appropriate health information. METHOD: Our qualitative analysis is based on data obtained from three focus groups with Spanish-speaking Hispanic adults conducted at a clinic in Nebraska. Participants were asked about their perceptions of health information in the form of videos, brochures, and websites. We followed the consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research and used the theoretical framework of content analysis. RESULTS: For videos, attributes associated with higher levels of trust included a friendly health professional, the logo or name of a health care institute, and a reference specifying ""se habla Español."" For brochures, attributes associated with trust included use of visual aids, use of numerous colors and big font sizes, the year of printing, and a health care agency logo. For websites, characteristics associated with trust were inclusion of plain language, use of pictures and videos, and date of last update. In all focus groups, participants perceived the use of mixed English/Spanish language in health information from pamphlets and websites as unprofessional. The use of unknown governmental logos in health promotional videos and websites was perceived as untrustworthy information. CONCLUSIONS: Spanish-speaking Hispanics prefer health information supported by a health care agency or delivered by a health care professional.

In China, Wuhan, Hubei Province was the epicenter. The disease is more severe in patients with high comorbidities and dialysis patients fall into this category. METHODS: In this report, we reviewed the whole course of the epidemic emerged in the HD center of Wuhan NO.1 Hospital by 28 February 2020. We compared the differences on the epidemiological characteristics and clinical features between patients surviving from COVID-19 and patients who died. RESULT: In this hospital, at time of the present report, 627 patients were on chronic hemodialysis and the prevalence of affected cases was 11.8% (74/627).The median age of the COVID-19-positive patients was 63 years (range 31-88), with an almost even gender distribution (females accounted for 54.4%).The most frequent presenting symptom was cough (41.9%), followed by fatigue (24.2%), fever (17.2%) and dyspnea (14.8%); 22.4% of the cases were and asymptomatic. Fourteen of the 74 patients died (19%), as for presenting symptoms, cough was more frequent in patients who died (P < 0.05). Surviving patients had higher levels of phosphate and albumin, and lower levels of C-reactive protein (CRP). Chest CT scan was positive in all cases, including in asymptomatic ones, and revealed in about three fourths of the cases bilateral (76.2%) lesions; in each lung lesions were multiple in about half of the cases of the cases (52.3%). After diagnosis, median time to death was 7 days in the 14 patients who died, with a range between 4 and 18 days. CONCLUSION: This preliminary, single Center study identifies hemodialysis patients as a population at high risk of severe, and deadly COVID-19 infection. While classic baseline clinical conditions, including age, kidney disease and gender, are not significantly associated with survival in COVID-19 infected hemodialysis, our study also suggests a significant association between risk of and death, poor nutritional status and less than optimal metabolic balance.","Min, Yonglong; Cheng, Li; Tu, Can; Li, Hongbo; He, Da; Huang, Dan; Chen, Dan; Huang, Xiaoli; Chen, Fang; Xiong, Fei",Int. urol. nephrol,283,1

Several kinases have been proposed as possible mediators of multiple viral infections, including life-threatening coronaviruses like SARS-CoV-1, Middle East syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2. Viral infections hijack abundant cell signaling pathways, resulting in drastic phosphorylation rewiring in the host and viral proteins. Some kinases play a significant role throughout the viral infection cycle (entry, replication, assembly, and egress), and several of them are involved in the virus-induced hyperinflammatory response that leads to cytokine storm, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), organ injury, and death.

However, dialysis supplies and personnel are often limited. METHODS: Using data from adult hospitalized COVID-19 patients from five hospitals from the Mount Sinai Health System who were admitted from March 10th and December 26th, 2020, we developed and validated several models (logistic regression, LASSO, random forest, and XGBoost (with and without imputation)) for predicting treatment with dialysis or death at various time horizons (1, 3, 5 and 7 days) following hospital admission. Patients admitted to the Mount Sinai Hospital were used for internal validation while the other hospitals were part of the external validation cohort. Features included demographics, comorbidities, and laboratory and vitals signs within 12 hour of hospital admission. RESULTS: 6093 patients (2,442 in training and 3,651 in external validation) were included in the final cohort. Of the different model approaches used, XGBoost without imputation had the highest area under the receiver curve on internal validation (range of 0.93-0.98) and area under the precision recall curve (range of 0.78-0.82 across) for all time points. XGBoost without imputation also had the highest test parameters on external validation (AUROC range 0.85 to 0.87, and AUPRC range of 0.27 to 0.54) across all time windows. XGBoost without imputation outperformed all models with higher precision and recall (mean difference in AUROC of 0.04 and mean difference in AUPRC of 0.15). Features of creatinine, Blood Urea Nitrogen, and Red cell distribution width were major drivers of model's prediction. CONCLUSIONS: An XGBoost model without imputation for prediction of a composite outcome of either death or dialysis in COVID positive patients had the best performance compared to standard and other machine learning models.","Vaid, Akhil; Chan, Lili; Chaudhary, Kumardeep; Jaladanki, Suraj; Paranjpe, Ishan; Russak, Adam; Kia, Arash; Timsina, Prem; Levin, Matthew; He, John; Bottinger, Erwin; Charney, Alexander; Fayad, Zahi; Coca, Steven; Glicksberg, Benjamin; Nadkarni, Girish",Clin. j. am. soc. nephrol,283,16

Case decisions in the cath labs should be individualized, taking into account the risk of 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) exposure versus the risk of delay in diagnosis or therapy. In patients with known or suspected COVID-19 and ischemic heart disease, the balance of staff exposure and patient benefit will need to be weighed carefully. AIM OF THE WORK: Analyzing and assessing the impact of COVID 19 pandemic on the: (1) volume, type of patients, and the different procedures performed. (2) The changes in management trends of cardiologists in the cath labs. RESULTS: This study has surveyed 30 cath labs distributed all over Egypt during COVID-19 pandemic with 43.35% in urban area and 56.7% in rural areas. Only 63.3% of surveyed centers were well equipped to deal with COVID-19 active patients and full personal protective equipment was worn in only 6.7% of patients. A decrease in the volume of new acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients, ST-elevation myocardial infarction patients and primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was recorded in 80%, 83%, and 80% of the surveyed centers respectively. Regarding the delay in the invasive management for patients with ACS due to diagnostic testing, there was 100% delay in all surveyed centers with 70% of centers suffering from delay in primary PCI due to awaited testing. On the other hand, there was a decrease in the volume of patients receiving elective procedures in 83.3% of cath labs. CONCLUSION: The management trends in the current Egyptian survey were significantly impacted during COVID-19 pandemic. Primary PCI volume much reduced and takes longer time than should be.","Mahmoud, Sharaf E D; Etriby, Shehab E; Etriby, Adel E; Ghalib, Alaa",Curr Probl Cardiol,283,20

During this period, there was a significant increase in supermarket expenditure. It has been shown that stress, anxiety and boredom are triggers for unhealthy eating habits. Fat consumption is a risk factor for both the development of gallstones and, additionally, the development of acute calculous cholecystitis. The aim of this study was to assess the incidence of acute calculous cholecystitis during the nationwide lockdown and compare it to the same period one year prior. METHODS: A retrospective review of all emergency abdominal imaging performed during the first 5 weeks of the lockdown was completed using the hospital PACS (picture archiving and communication system). All cases of acute calculous cholecystitis were identified and compared with the same period 1 year prior. RESULTS: Eighteen cases of acute calculous cholecystitis were identified from 24 March to 27 April 2020. Eleven cases were identified during the same period in 2019. This represented an increase of 63%. Non-COVID-19-related emergency presentations decreased during this period, and imaging of emergency presentations decreased by 24%. The rate of scans positive for acute cholecystitis more than doubled (p < 0.037). CONCLUSION: A statistically significant increase in cases of acute calculous cholecystitis was observed during a nationwide lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is hypothesised that this is due to increased consumption of fatty foods during this period due to stress, anxiety and boredom.","Murphy, Mark C; Dempsey, Philip J; Gillespie, Ciara D; Murphy, Alexandra N; McNicholas, Michelle M J",Ir. j. med. sci,283,16

Local fabrication based on 3D printing is one way to address this challenge, particularly in the case of products such as protective face shields. No clear path exists, however, for introducing a locally fabricated product into a clinical setting. Methods: We describe a research protocol under Institutional Review Board supervision that allowed clinicians to participate in an iterative design process followed by real-world testing in an emergency department. All designs, materials used, testing protocols, and survey results are reported in full to facilitate similar efforts in other clinical settings. Findings: Clinical testing allowed the incident command team at a major academic medical center to introduce the locally fabricated face shield into general use in a rapid but well-controlled manner. Unlike standard hospital face shields, the locally fabricated design was intended to be reusable. We discuss the design and testing process and provide an overview of regulatory considerations associated with fabrication and testing of personal protective equipment, such as face shields. Conclusions: Our work serves as a case study for robust, local responses to pandemic-related disruption of medical supply chains with implications for health care professionals, hospital administrators, regulatory agencies, and concerned citizens in the COVID-19 and future health care emergencies.

In Israel during the covid-19 pandemic and mandatory lockdown, nursing students encountered a new reality of economic uncertainty, fear of infection, challenges of distance education, lack of personal protection equipment (PPE) at work etc. The objective of this study was to assess levels of anxiety and ways of coping among nursing students in the Ashkelon Academic College, Southern District, Israel. A cross-sectional study was conducted among all 244 students in the nursing department during the third week of a national lockdown. Anxiety level was assessed using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item Scale with a cut-off point of 10 for moderate and of 15 for severe anxiety. Factor analysis was used to identify coping components. The prevalence of moderate and severe anxiety was 42.8% and 13.1% respectively. Gender, lack of PPE, and fear of infection were significantly associated with a higher anxiety score. Stronger resilience and usage of humor were associated with significantly lower anxiety levels, while mental disengagement with higher anxiety levels.

Accordingly, characteristics of households in a region have been shown to relate to transmission heterogeneity of the virus. We introduce a discrete-time stochastic epidemiological model to examine the impact of the household size distribution in a region on the transmission dynamics. We choose parameters to reflect incidence in two health regions of the Greater Vancouver area in British Columbia and simulate the impact of distancing measures on transmission, with household size distribution the only different parameter between simulations for the two regions. Our result suggests that the dissimilarity in household size distribution alone can cause significant differences in incidence of the two regions, and the distributions drive distinct dynamics that match reported cases. Furthermore, our model suggests that offering individuals a place to isolate outside their household can speed the decline in cases, and does so more effectively where there are more larger households.","Liu, Pengyu; McQuarrie, Lisa; Song, Yexuan; Colijn, Caroline",J R Soc Interface,283,26

We present a fast and simple assay principle for antigen detection and demonstrate its functionality by detecting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antigens in nasopharyngeal swabs. The method is based on the detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein (NP) and S protein (SP) via time-resolved Förster resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) with donor- and acceptor-labeled polyclonal anti-NP and -SP antibodies. Using recombinant proteins and cell culture-grown SARS-CoV-2, the limits of detection were established as 25 pg of NP or 20 infectious units (IU) and 875 pg of SP or 625 IU. Testing reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR)-positive (n = 48, with cycle threshold [CT ] values from 11 to 30) or -negative (n = 96) nasopharyngeal swabs demonstrated that the assay yielded positive results for all samples with CT values of <25 and for a single RT-PCR-negative sample. Virus isolation from the RT-PCR-positive nasopharyngeal swabs showed a strong association between the presence of infectious virus and a positive antigen test result. The NP-based assay showed 97.4% (37/38) sensitivity and 100% (10/10) specificity in comparison with virus isolation and 77.1% (37/48) sensitivity and 99.0% (95/96) specificity in comparison with SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. The assay is performed in a buffer that neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 infectivity, and the assay is relatively simple to set up as an ""in-house"" test. Here, SARS-CoV-2 served as the model pathogen, but the assay principle is applicable to other viral infections, and the test format could easily be adapted to high-throughput testing.IMPORTANCE PCR is currently the gold standard for the diagnosis of many acute infections. While PCR and its variants are highly sensitive and specific, the time from sampling to results is measured in hours at best. Antigen tests directly detect parts of the infectious agent, which may enable faster diagnosis but often at lower sensitivity and specificity. Here, we describe a technique for rapid antigen detection and demonstrate the test format's potential using SARS-CoV-2 as the model pathogen. The 10-min test, performed in a buffer that readily inactivates SARS-CoV-2, from nasopharyngeal samples identified 97.4% (37/38) of the samples from which we could isolate the virus. This suggests that the test performs well in identifying patients potentially shedding the virus. Although SARS-CoV-2 served as the model pathogen to demonstrate proof of concept, the test principle itself would be applicable to a wide variety of infectious and perhaps also noninfectious diseases.","Rusanen, Juuso; Kareinen, Lauri; Szirovicza, Leonora; Ugurlu, Hasan; Levanov, Lev; Jääskeläinen, Anu; Ahava, Maarit; Kurkela, Satu; Saksela, Kalle; Hedman, Klaus; Vapalahti, Olli; Hepojoki, Jussi",mBio (Online),283,26

This paper examines how heightened fears of contracting the virus, financial impacts, and social isolation contribute to declining mental health among this already vulnerable group. OBJECTIVE/HYPOTHESIS: This paper investigates how increases in anxiety, stress, and despair are associated with concerns about getting infected, COVID-19-induced financial hardship, and increased social isolation as a result of adhering to protective measures among people with disabilities and chronic health conditions. METHODS: This study uses original national quota-based online survey data (n = 1027) collected in June 2020 from people with disabilities and chronic health conditions. Three logistic regression models investigate the relationship between COVID-19's effects on finances, concerns about contracting the virus, changes in loneliness and belonging, and measures taken to combat the spread of COVID-19 and reports of increased anxiety, stress, and despair, net of covariates. RESULTS: Models show that increased anxiety, stress, and despair were associated with negative financial effects of COVID-19, greater concerns about contracting COVID-19, increased loneliness, and decreased feelings of belonging. Net of other covariates, increased measures taken to combat COVID-19 was not significantly associated with mental health outcomes.

Currently, a large amount of primary data have been generated from several preclinical studies. At least 300 clinical trials are underway for drug repurposing against COVID-19; the clinician needs objective evidence-based medication to treat COVID-19. OBSERVATIONS: Single-stranded RNA viral genome of SARS-CoV-2 encodes structural proteins (spike protein), non-structural enzymatic proteins (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, papain-like protease, 3-chymotrypsin-like protease) and other accessory proteins. These four enzymatic proteins on spike protein are rate-limiting steps in viral replications and, therefore, an attractive target for drug development against SARS-CoV-2. In silico and in vitro studies have identified various potential epitomes as candidate sequences for vaccine development. These studies have also revealed potential targets for drug development and drug repurposing against COVID-19. Clinical trials utilizing antiviral drugs and other drugs have given inconclusive results regarding their clinical efficacy and side effects. The need for angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE-2) inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers and corticosteroids has been recommended. Western countries have adopted telemedicine as an alternative to prevent transmission of infection in the population. Currently, no proven, evidence-based therapeutic regimen exists for COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has put tremendous pressure on researchers to evaluate and approve drugs effective against the disease. Well-controlled randomized trials should assess medicines that are not marketed with substantial evidence of safety and efficacy and more emphasis on time tested approaches for drug evaluation.","Shah, Naveed Nazir; Nabi, Showkat Ul; Rather, Muzafar Ahmad; Kalwar, Qudratullah; Ali, Sofi Imtiyaz; Sheikh, Wajid Mohammad; Ganai, Alveena; Bashir, Showkeen Muzamil",Basic clin. pharmacol. toxicol,283,20

Hospitals and health systems faced significant burdens during this time, particularly in New York City. APPROACH: Third- and fourth-year medical students at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai formed the COVID-19 Student WorkForce to connect students to essential roles in the Mount Sinai Hospital System and support physicians, staff members, researchers, and hospital operations. With the administration's support, the WorkForce grew to include over 530 medical and graduate students. A methodology was developed for clinical students to receive elective credit for these volunteer activities. OUTCOMES: From March 15, 2020 to June 14, 2020, student volunteers recorded 29,602 hours (2,277 hours per week) in 7 different task forces which operated at 7 different hospitals throughout the health system. Volunteers included students from all years of medical school as well as PhD, master's, and nursing students. The autonomous structure of the COVID-19 Student WorkForce was unique and contributed to its ability to quickly mobilize students to necessary tasks. The group leaders collaborated with other medical schools in the New York City area, sharing best practices and resources and consulting on a variety of topics. EXT STEPS: Going forward, the COVID-19 Student WorkForce will continue to collaborate with student leaders of other institutions and prevent volunteer burnout; transition select initiatives into structured, precepted student roles for clinical education; and maintain a state of readiness in the event of a second surge of COVID-19 infections in the New York City area.","Bahethi, Rohini R; Liu, Benjamin Y; Asriel, Benjamin; Blum, James R; Huxley-Reicher, Zina; Agathis, Alexandra Z; Pathak, Shravani; Sainté Willis, Michelle; Muller, David",Acad. med,283,16

During the COVID-19 pandemic, moral distress in medical personnel has gained attention, related to the impact of pandemic-associated factors, such as the uncertainty of treatment options for the virus and the accelerated pace of deaths. Measures to provide aid and mitigate the long-term pandemic effect on providers are starting to be designed. Yet, little has been said about the moral distress experienced by patients and the relational and additive effect on provider moral distress. Pandemic-associated factors affecting moral distress in patients include the constraining effects of isolation on spiritual and religious traditions as well as the intentional separation of patients from their families. This paper will explore the idea that patients are suffering their own moral distress and further how this impacts the intensity of moral distress experienced by the providers-nurses and physicians. The paucity of research in this area with the implications on patient's distress, decision making, and distress experienced by providers compels further investigation and analysis.","Vittone, Sarah; Sotomayor, Claudia R",HEC forum,283,26

She has recently completed her second PhD in Social Sciences (Northumbria University). She also acted as post-doctoral researcher at the Desertification Research Centre (University of Sassari, Italy) investigating the adaptive capacity of some communities to climate change impact. This paper analyses the first phases of the Covid-19 (Coronavirus) outbreak management in Italy by exploring the combination of political, scientific, media and public responses. A lack of coordination between political and scientific levels, and between institutional claim-makers and the media, suggests a mismanagement of the crisis during the first phases of the outbreak. The outbreak management suffered from the five communication weaknesses identified by Reynolds, related to i) mixed messages from multiple messengers; ii) delay in releasing information; iii) paternalistic attitudes; iv) lack of immediate reaction to rumours; and v) political confusion. This supports that the communication of uncertainty around an unknown threat should be accompanied by both political and scientific cohesion. However, both political and scientific dysfunctions caused the failure of several government efforts to contain the outbreak. This paper contributes towards informing policymakers on some lessons learned from the management of the Covid-19 in one of the most affected countries in the world. The Italian case study offers the opportunity for other countries to improve the management of the outbreak by limiting the spread of both chaos and panic.","Ruiu, Maria Laura",J. Risk Res.,283,16

The model assumes that the images in the dataset are non-linear mappings of low-dimensional latent vectors. We use the deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to represent the non-linear transformation. The parameters of the generator as well as the low-dimensional latent vectors are jointly estimated only from the undersampled measurements. This approach is different from traditional CNN approaches that require extensive fully sampled training data. We penalize the norm of the gradients of the non-linear mapping to constrain the manifold to be smooth, while temporal gradients of the latent vectors are penalized to obtain a smoothly varying time-series. The proposed scheme brings in the spatial regularization provided by the convolutional network. The main benefit of the proposed scheme is the improvement in image quality and the orders-of-magnitude reduction in memory demand compared to traditional manifold models. To minimize the computational complexity of the algorithm, we introduce an efficient progressive training-in-time approach and an approximate cost function. These approaches speed up the image reconstructions and offers better reconstruction performance.","Zou, Qing; Ahmed, Abdul Haseeb; Nagpal, Prashant; Kruger, Stanley; Jacob, Mathews",IEEE. trans. med. imaging,283,21

However, high variability in results emerged, potentially due to logistic paradigms adopted. Here, we analyze stroke code admissions, hospitalizations, and stroke belt performance for ischemic stroke patients in the metropolitan Bologna region, comparing temporal trends between 2019 and 2020 to define the impact of COVID-19 on the stroke network. METHODS: This retrospective observational study included all people admitted at the Bologna Metropolitan Stroke Center in timeframes 1 March 2019-30 April 2019 (cohort-2019) and 1 March 2020-30 April 2020 (cohort-2020). Diagnosis, treatment strategy, and timing were compared between the two cohorts to define temporal trends. RESULTS: Overall, 283 patients were admitted to the Stroke Center, with no differences in demographic factors between cohort-2019 and cohort-2020. In cohort-2020, transient ischemic attack (TIA) was significantly less prevalent than 2019 (6.9% vs 14.4%, p = .04). Among 216 ischemic stroke patients, moderate-to-severe stroke was more represented in cohort-2020 (17.8% vs 6.2%, p = .027). Similar proportions of patients underwent reperfusion (45.9% in 2019 vs 53.4% in 2020), although a slight increase in combined treatment was detected (14.4% vs 25.4%, p = .05). Door-to-scan timing was significantly prolonged in 2020 compared with 2019 (28.4 ± 12.6 vs 36.7 ± 14.6, p = .03), although overall timing from stroke to treatment was preserved. CONCLUSION: During COVID-19 pandemic, TIA and minor stroke consistently reduced compared to the same timeframe in 2019. Longer stroke-to-call and door-to-scan times, attributable to change in citizen behavior and screening at hospital arrival, did not impact on stroke-to-treatment time. Mothership model might have minimized the effects of the pandemic on the stroke care organization.","Zini, Andrea; Romoli, Michele; Gentile, Mauro; Migliaccio, Ludovica; Picoco, Cosimo; Dell039,; Arciprete, Oscar; Simonetti, Luigi; Naldi, Federica; Piccolo, Laura; Gordini, Giovanni; Tagliatela, Francesco; Bua, Vincenzo; Cirillo, Luigi; Princiotta, Ciro; Coniglio, Carlo; Descovich, Carlo; Cortelli, Pietro",Neurol Sci,283,16

RECENT FINDINGS: ACE2 has quickly gained prominence in basic research as it has been identified as the main entry receptor for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This novel pathogen causes Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), a pathogenic condition that reached pandemic proportion and is associated with unprecedented morbidity and mortality. SUMMARY: The renin-angiotensin system is a complex, coordinated hormonal cascade that plays a pivotal role in controlling individual cell behaviour and multiple organ functions. ACE2 acts as an endogenous counter-regulator to the pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic pathways triggered by ACE through the conversion of Ang II into the vasodilatory peptide Ang 1-7. We discuss the structure, function and expression of ACE2 in different tissues. We also briefly describe the role of ACE2 as a pivotal driver across a wide spectrum of pathogenic conditions, such as cardiac and renal diseases. Furthermore, we provide the most recent data concerning the possible role of ACE2 in mediating SARS-CoV-2 infection and dictating COVID-19 severity.","Perico, Luca; Benigni, Ariela; Remuzzi, Giuseppe",Curr Opin Nephrol Hypertens,283,20

This self-study of teaching and teacher education practices (S-STTEP) builds on previous research to transform traditional face-to-face lessons into effective online lessons using alternate modes of delivery. In this paper, Ted shares some of his signature lessons including ice-breakers, critical response questions, discussions, group activities, and jigsaws, utilizing Moodle, Big Blue Button, Padlet, Google Docs, and other online tools. With Georgann’s help as a critical friend, Ted critically analyzed his teaching of Master of Education graduate students through S-STTEP. In addition, he explored comparative ethnographic narrative (CEN) as another way of knowing within the S-STTEP space. Data included detailed weekly reflections. In addition, students provided written feedback at the end of each class, and at the end of term through a survey and course evaluation. Ted shared weekly electronic journal reflections and student feedback with Georgann, via email and teleconferences. Then, together Ted and Georgann made meaning from these field texts. The research text evolved from teacher-to-teacher conversations. Promising pedagogies for synchronous and face to face learning were identified with several signature lessons the focus.

Front-line staff, those most heavily exposed to the virus, are also those most at risk of developing psychological disorders. The aim of this national survey was to determine the prevalence of psychological disorders among the nurses working in intensive care unit during the pandemic. We developed an electronic questionnaire distributed by email between June 17th and July 17th, 2020. The responders were 381 health care professionals (nurses, anaesthetists nurse, operating room nurses and health managers). The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Impact Event Scale Revisited were used to assess the prevalence of anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. Operating Room Nurses were those who suffered the most from psychological disorders: anxiety disorder (64%) (p = 0.055), depression (45%) (p = 0.004) and post-traumatic stress disorder (45%) (p = 0.008). Nurses usually working in intensive care were the least affected by psychological disorders: anxiety disorder (30%), depressive disorder (11%) and post-traumatic stress (20%). The risk factors for developing a psychological disorder are the low level of training in intensive care unit (ICU), not being volunteer for working in ICU and having a burnout history. This study describes a profile of professionals at risk of developing psychological disorders in this setting.

We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of primary prophylaxis (PP) with biosimilar filgrastim-sndz in patients with intermediate risk of FN compared with secondary prophylaxis (SP) over three different cancer types. METHODS: A Markov decision analytic model was constructed from the US payer perspective over a lifetime horizon to evaluate PP versus SP in patients with breast cancer, non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Cost-effectiveness was evaluated over a range of willingness-to-pay thresholds for incremental cost per FN avoided, life year gained, and quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Sensitivity analyses evaluated uncertainty. RESULTS: Compared with SP, PP provided an additional 0.102-0.144 LYs and 0.065-0.130 QALYs. The incremental cost-effectiveness ranged from $5,660 in US dollars (USD) to $20,806 USD per FN event avoided, $5,123 to $31,077 USD per life year gained, and $7,213 to $35,563 USD per QALY gained. Over 1,000 iterations, there were 73.6%, 99.4%, and 91.8% probabilities that PP was cost-effective at a willingness to pay of $50,000 USD per QALY gained for breast cancer, NSCLC, and NHL, respectively. CONCLUSION: PP with a biosimilar filgrastim (specifically filgrastim-sndz) is cost-effective in patients with intermediate risk for FN receiving curative chemotherapy regimens for breast cancer, NSCLC, and NHL. Expanding the use of colony-stimulating factors for patients may be valuable in reducing unnecessary health care visits for patients with cancer at risk of complications because of COVID-19 and should be considered for the indefinite future.","Li, Edward; Mezzio, Dylan J; Campbell, David; Campbell, Kim; Lyman, Gary H",JCO Oncol Pract,283,16

Complications of COVID-19 are closely related to an upregulation of the inflammatory response revealed by the pro-inflammatory profile of plasma cytokines (to the point of causing a cytokine storm), which is also a contributing cause of the associated coagulation disorders with venous and arterial thromboembolisms, causing multiple organ dysfunction and failure. In severe fulminant cases of COVID-19, there is an activation of coagulation and consumption of clotting factors leading to a deadly disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). It is well established that human immune response changes with age, and also that the pro-inflammatory profile of plasma cytokines is upregulated in both healthy and diseased elderly people. In fact, normal aging is known to be associated with a subclinical, sterile, low-grade, systemic pro-inflammatory state linked to the chronic activation of the innate immune system, a phenomenon known as ""inflammaging"". Inflammaging may play a role as a condition contributing to the co-occurrence of the severe hyper-inflammatory state (cytokine storm) during COVID-19, and also in other severe infections (sepsis) in older people. Moreover, we must consider the impact of inflammation on coagulation due to the crosstalk between inflammation and coagulation. The systemic inflammatory state and coagulation disorders are closely related, a phenomenon that here we call ""coagul-aging"" (Giunta S.). In this review, we discuss the various degrees of inflammation in older adults after being infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and the adverse effects of aging on the inflammatory response and coagulation system. It is important to note that although there is no gender difference in susceptibility to COVID-19 infection, however, due to differences in angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression, innate immunity, and comorbidities, older men exhibit more severe disease and higher mortality than older women. There are currently no FDA-approved specific antiviral drugs that can be used against the virus. Therapies used in patients with COVID-19 consist of remdesivir, dexamethasone, low-molecular-weight heparin, in addition to monoclonal antibodies against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 in the early phase of the disease. Future pharmacological research should also consider targeting the possible role of the underlying scenario of inflammaging in healthy older people to prevent or mitigate disease complications. It is worth mentioning that some specific cytokine antagonists and traditional Chinese medicine preparations can reduce the elderly's inflammatory state.","Xu, Kangqiao; Wei, Yaqin; Giunta, Sergio; Zhou, Min; Xia, Shijin",Exp Gerontol,283,1

The results show that the nationwide lockdown, decreed on 13 March by the Spanish government, exerted a statistically significant effect upon most pollution indicators. The estimates range from approximately −82% (NO and NO2) to −3% (CO). Reversely, the COVID-19 induced lockdown raised O3 levels by an average of 20%. By using data from 43 stations spread out among the region, the paper provides a local level analysis. This analysis reveals substantial differences across areas and across pollutants.

Recent advances in next generation sequencing (NGS)-based metagenomics allow pan-pathogen detection in a single assay, and may have significant advantages over culture-based techniques. RESULTS: We conducted a cohort study of 159 CAP patients to assess the diagnostic performance of a clinical metagenomics assay and its impact on clinical management and patient outcomes. When compared to other techniques, clinical metagenomics detected more pathogens in more CAP cases, and identified a substantial number of polymicrobial infections. Moreover, metagenomics results led to changes in or confirmation of clinical management in 35 of 59 cases; these 35 cases also had significantly improved patient outcomes.

Despite the available reviews that summarized its autoimmune/rheumatic manifestations, a systematic approach is still lacking. Therefore, we conducted a comprehensive systematic review in order to give an overview upon these rare but clinically significant manifestations. Methods: We performed a literature search of PubMed and EMBASE as of October 9, 2020. All articles relevant to either systemic or organ-specific autoimmune and rheumatic manifestations potentially associated with COVID-19 were collected. The reviewed literature were limited to adults &#8805;18 years. Results: Although most of the existing evidence was based on case reports or case series without a long-term follow-up, a variety of autoimmune/rheumatic manifestations were associated with COVID-19. The manifestations that have a consistent association with COVID-19 include autoimmune cytopenia, cutaneous vasculitis, encephalitis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome. Such association is conflicting as regards to antiphospholipid syndrome, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, and myasthenia gravis. Conclusion: Our systematic review indicated the potential of the COVID-19 virus to trigger a myriad of autoimmune and rheumatic manifestations, which should be considered amid global efforts to combat COVID-19.","Tang, Kuo-Tung; Hsu, Bo-Chueh; Chen, Der-Yuan",Front Immunol,283,7

We hypothesized that COVID-19 is accompanied by procoagulant platelets with subsequent alteration of the coagulation system. We investigated depolarization of mitochondrial inner transmembrane potential (&#916;&#936;m), cytosolic calcium (Ca2+) concentration, and phosphatidylserine (PS) externalization. Platelets from COVID-19 patients in the intensive care unit (ICU; n = 21) showed higher &#916;&#936;m depolarization, cytosolic Ca2+, and PS externalization compared with healthy controls (n = 18) and non-ICU COVID-19 patients (n = 4). Moreover, significant higher cytosolic Ca2+ and PS were observed compared with a septic ICU control group (ICU control; n = 5). In the ICU control group, cytosolic Ca2+ and PS externalization were comparable with healthy controls, with an increase in &#916;&#936;m depolarization. Sera from COVID-19 patients in the ICU induced a significant increase in apoptosis markers (&#916;&#936;m depolarization, cytosolic Ca2+, and PS externalization) compared with healthy volunteers and septic ICU controls. Interestingly, immunoglobulin G fractions from COVID-19 patients induced an FcÎ³ receptor IIA-dependent platelet apoptosis (&#916;&#936;m depolarization, cytosolic Ca2+, and PS externalization). Enhanced PS externalization in platelets from COVID-19 patients in the ICU was associated with increased sequential organ failure assessment score (r = 0.5635) and D-dimer (r = 0.4473). Most importantly, patients with thrombosis had significantly higher PS externalization compared with those without. The strong correlations between markers for apoptosic and procoagulant platelets and D-dimer levels, as well as the incidence of thrombosis, may indicate that antibody-mediated procoagulant platelets potentially contributes to sustained increased thromboembolic risk in ICU COVID-19 patients.","Althaus, Karina; Marini, Irene; Zlamal, Jan; Pelzl, Lisann; Singh, Anurag; Häberle, Helene; Mehrländer, Martin; Hammer, Stefanie; Schulze, Harald; Bitzer, Michael; Malek, Nisar; Rath, Dominik; Bösmüller, Hans; Nieswandt, Bernard; Gawaz, Meinrad; Bakchoul, Tamam; Rosenberger, Peter",Blood,283,24

Currently, there are no effective medications against coronavirus. In the present study, we utilized a holistic bioinformatics approach to study gene signatures of SARS-CoV- and SARS-CoV-2-infected Calu-3 lung adenocarcinoma cells. Through the Gene Ontology platform, we determined that several cytokine genes were up-regulated after SARS-CoV-2 infection, including TNF, IL6, CSF2, IFNL1, IL-17C, CXCL10, and CXCL11. Differentially regulated pathways were detected by the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, gene ontology, and Hallmark platform, including chemokines, cytokines, cytokine receptors, cytokine metabolism, inflammation, immune responses, and cellular responses to the virus. A Venn diagram was utilized to illustrate common overlapping genes from SARS-CoV- and SARS-CoV-2-infected datasets. An Ingenuity pathway analysis discovered an enrichment of tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) and interleukin (IL)-17-related signaling in a gene set enrichment analysis. Downstream networks were predicted by the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery platform also revealed that TNF and TNF receptor 2 signaling elicited leukocyte recruitment, activation, and survival of host cells after coronavirus infection.

Methods: Baseline demographics and clinicopathological data of eligible patients were retrieved from medical records. Information of clinical manifestations, history of epidemiology, lab tests and chest CT scan images of visiting patients from February 13 to February 28 were collected. Literatures about pulmonary infiltrates in cancer patients were searched from databases including PUBMED, EMBASE and CNKI. Results: Among the 139 cancer patients who underwent chest CT scans before chemotherapy, pulmonary infiltrates were identified in eight patients (5.8%), five of whom were characterized with GGOs in lungs. 2019-nCoV nuclear acid testing was performed in three patients and the results were negative. One case was a 66-year-old man who was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma and underwent CHOP chemotherapy regimen. His chest CT scan image displayed multiple GGOs in lungs and the complete blood count showed decreased lymphocytes. This patient denied any contact with confirmed/suspected cases of 2019-nCoV infection, fever or other respiratory symptoms. Considering the negative result of nuclear acid testing, this patient was presumptively diagnosed with viral pneumonia and an experiential anti-infection treatment had been prescribed for him. Conclusions: The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) complicates the clinical scenario of pulmonary infiltrates in cancer patients. The epidemic history, clinical manifestation, CT scan image and lab test should be taken into combined consideration. The 2019-nCoV nuclear acid testing might be applied in more selected patients.

Many countries with low COVID-19 death rates have a common feature of eating large quantities of fermented vegetables such as cabbage and, in some continents, various spices. Fermented vegetables and spices are agonists of the antioxidant transcription factor nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2), and spices are transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 and vanillin 1 (TRPA1/V1) agonists. These mechanisms may explain many COVID-19 symptoms and severity. It appears that there is a synergy between Nrf2 and TRPA1/V1 foods that may explain the role of diet in COVID-19. One of the mechanisms of COVID-19 appears to be an oxygen species (ROS)-mediated process in synergy with TRP channels, modulated by Nrf2 pathways. Spicy foods are likely to desensitize TRP channels and act in synergy with exogenous antioxidants that activate the Nrf2 pathway.","Bousquet, Jean; Czarlewski, Wienczyslawa; Zuberbier, Torsten; Mullol, Joaquim; Blain, Hubert; Cristol, Jean-Paul; De La Torre, Rafael; Le Moing, Vincent; Pizarro Lozano, Nieves; Bedbrook, Anna; Agache, Ioana; Akdis, Cezmi A; Canonica, G Walter; Cruz, Alvaro A; Fiocchi, Alessandro; Fonseca, Joao A; Fonseca, Susana; Gemicioglu, Bilun; Haahtela, Tari; Iaccarino, Guido; Ivancevich, Juan Carlos; Jutel, Marek; Klimek, Ludger; Kuna, Piotr; Larenas-Linnemann, Désirée E; Melén, Erik; Okamoto, Yoshitaka; Papadopoulos, Nikolaos G; Pfaar, Oliver; Reynes, Jacques; Rolland, Yves; Rouadi, Philip W; Samolinski, Boleslaw; Sheikh, Aziz; Toppila-Salmi, Sanna; Valiulis, Arunas; Choi, Hak-Jong; Kim, Hyun Ju; Anto, Josep M",Int Arch Allergy Immunol,283,24

To characterize T cell immunity, but also for the development of vaccines, identification of exact viral T cell epitopes is fundamental. Here we identify and characterize multiple dominant and subdominant SARS-CoV-2 HLA class I and HLA-DR peptides as potential T cell epitopes in COVID-19 convalescent and unexposed individuals. SARS-CoV-2-specific peptides enabled detection of post-infectious T cell immunity, even in seronegative convalescent individuals. Cross-reactive SARS-CoV-2 peptides revealed pre-existing T cell responses in 81% of unexposed individuals and validated similarity with common cold coronaviruses, providing a functional basis for heterologous immunity in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Diversity of SARS-CoV-2 T cell responses was associated with mild symptoms of COVID-19, providing evidence that immunity requires recognition of multiple epitopes. Together, the proposed SARS-CoV-2 T cell epitopes enable identification of heterologous and post-infectious T cell immunity and facilitate development of diagnostic, preventive and therapeutic measures for COVID-19.","Nelde, Annika; Bilich, Tatjana; Heitmann, Jonas S; Maringer, Yacine; Salih, Helmut R; Roerden, Malte; Lübke, Maren; Bauer, Jens; Rieth, Jonas; Wacker, Marcel; Peter, Andreas; Hörber, Sebastian; Traenkle, Bjoern; Kaiser, Philipp D; Rothbauer, Ulrich; Becker, Matthias; Junker, Daniel; Krause, Gérard; Strengert, Monika; Schneiderhan-Marra, Nicole; Templin, Markus F; Joos, Thomas O; Kowalewski, Daniel J; Stos-Zweifel, Vlatka; Fehr, Michael; Rabsteyn, Armin; Mirakaj, Valbona; Karbach, Julia; Jäger, Elke; Graf, Michael; Gruber, Lena-Christin; Rachfalski, David; Preuß, Beate; Hagelstein, Ilona; Märklin, Melanie; Bakchoul, Tamam; Gouttefangeas, Cécile; Kohlbacher, Oliver; Klein, Reinhild; Stevanovic, Stefan; Rammensee, Hans-Georg; Walz, Juliane S",Nat. immunol,283,16

Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) have been shown to protect COVID-19 among healthcare workers, however, Kenya has faced PPE shortages that can adequately protect all healthcare workers. We, therefore, examined the health and economic consequences of investing in PPE for healthcare workers in Kenya. METHODS: We conducted a cost-effectiveness and return on investment (ROI) analysis using a decision-analytic model following the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) guidelines. We examined two outcomes: 1) the incremental cost per healthcare worker death averted, and 2) the incremental cost per healthcare worker COVID-19 case averted. We performed a multivariate sensitivity analysis using 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations. RESULTS: Kenya would need to invest $3.12 million (95% CI: 2.65–3.59) to adequately protect healthcare workers against COVID-19. This investment would avert 416 (IQR: 330–517) and 30,041 (IQR: 7243 – 102,480) healthcare worker deaths and COVID-19 cases respectively. Additionally, such an investment would result in a healthcare system ROI of $170.64 million (IQR: 138–209) – equivalent to an 11.04 times return. CONCLUSION: Despite other nationwide COVID-19 prevention measures such as social distancing, over 70% of healthcare workers will still be infected if the availability of PPE remains scarce. As part of the COVID-19 response strategy, the government should consider adequate investment in PPE for all healthcare workers in the country as it provides a large return on investment and it is value for money.","Kazungu, Jacob; Munge, Kenneth; Werner, Kalin; Risko, Nicholas; Vecino-Ortiz, Andres I.; Were, Vincent",BMC Health Serv Res,283,16

These microorganisms have multiple different types of interaction with each other. A plethora of evidence suggests that they can regulate immune and digestive systems and also play roles in various diseases, such as mental, cardiovascular, metabolic and some skin diseases. In addition, they take-part in some current health problems like diabetes mellitus, obesity, cancers and infections. Viral infection is one of the most common and problematic health care issues, particularly in recent years that pandemics like SARS and COVID-19 caused a lot of financial and physical damage to the world. There are plenty of articles investigating the interaction between microbiota and infectious diseases. We focused on stimulatory to suppressive effects of microbiota on viral infections, hoping to find a solution to overcome this current pandemic. Then we reviewed mechanistically the effects of both microbiota and probiotics on most of the viruses. But unlike previous studies which concentrated on intestinal microbiota and infection, our focus is on respiratory system’s microbiota and respiratory viral infection, bearing in mind that respiratory system is a proper entry site and residence for viruses, and whereby infection, can lead to asymptomatic, mild, self-limiting, severe or even fatal infection. Finally, we overgeneralize the effects of microbiota on COVID-19 infection. In addition, we reviewed the articles about effects of the microbiota on coronaviruses and suggest some new therapeutic measures.","Baghbani, Taha; Nikzad, Hossein; Azadbakht, Javid; Izadpanah, Fatemeh; Haddad Kashani, Hamed",Microb Cell Fact,283,24

College students were highly impacted, since many universities transferred curriculum from in-person to entirely online formats, physically separating students with little notice. With social distancing, their use of social networking sites (SNSs) likely changed during the COVID-19 pandemic, possibly holding implications for well-being. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine (1) how components of SNS use (ie, weekly frequency, time per day, habitual use, engagement, enjoyment, addiction, and emotional impact) changed from before to during COVID-19, (2) how these changes in SNS use were associated with pandemic-related social and emotional well-being, and (3) how SNS use and changes in use during the pandemic were associated with loneliness. METHODS: College students (N=176) were surveyed during the time when their university campus in the United States was operating online. Participants completed the same SNS use questionnaires twice, once with regard to the month preceding the onset of COVID-19 and again with regard to the month since this time. They also reported the extent to which they experienced perceived change in social support resulting from the pandemic, pandemic-related stress, and general loneliness. RESULTS: After the onset of COVID-19, participants showed an increase in daily time spent on SNSs (t(169)=5.53, d=0.42, P<.001), habitual use (t(173)=3.60, d=0.27, P<.001), and addiction (t(173)=4.96, d=0.38, P<.001); further, enjoyment on SNSs decreased (t(173)=–2.10, d=–0.16, P=.04) and the emotional impact of SNS activities became more negative (t(172)=–3.76, d=–0.29, P<.001). Increased perceived social support during COVID-19 was associated with changes in frequency of SNS use, time per day, addiction, and engagement (r>0.18 for all). Pandemic-related stress was associated with changes in SNS addiction and the extent to which one’s SNS content was related to the pandemic (r>0.20 for all). Loneliness was positively associated with SNS addiction (r=0.26) and negatively associated with SNS engagement (r=–0.19) during the pandemic. Loneliness was also negatively associated with changes in habit and engagement (r<–0.15 for all). CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that components of SNS use are associated with both positive and negative pandemic-related social outcomes, but largely negative pandemic-related emotional outcomes. Further, some components of SNS use are positively associated with loneliness (eg, addiction) while others show a negative association (eg, engagement). These findings provide a more nuanced picture of how SNS use is associated with social and emotional well-being during the time of a global health crisis when in-person interactions are scarce.","Tuck, Alison B; Thompson, Renee J",JMIR Form Res,283,1

In this study, we compared a total of 371 SARS-CoV-2 published whole genomes reported from different parts of Bangladesh with 467 sequences reported globally to understand the origin of viruses, possible patterns of mutations, and availability of unique mutations. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that SARS-CoV-2 viruses might have transmitted through infected travelers from European countries, and the GR clade was found as predominant in Bangladesh. Our analyses revealed 4604 mutations at the RNA level including 2862 missense mutations, 1192 synonymous mutations, 25 insertions and deletions and 525 other types of mutation. In line with the global trend, D614 G mutation in spike glycoprotein was predominantly high (98%) in Bangladeshi isolates. Interestingly, we found the average number of mutations in ORF1ab, S, ORF3a, M, and N were significantly higher (p < 0.001) for sequences containing the G614 variant compared to those having D614. Previously reported frequent mutations, such as R203K, D614G, G204R, P4715L and I300F at protein levels were also prevalent in Bangladeshi isolates.

These are unintentionally overshadowing others such as food security, increase of human population, preservation of natural ecosystems, water scarcity and reliability of energy supply, amongst others. This fact tends to obscure the reality that most, if not all the global challenges, are closely interdependent and need a holistic approach to deal with them in a coherent and effective way. Likewise, society at large must be made fully aware that there will not be an enduring solution unless there is a change in the level of consumption of goods and energy in affluent countries. There is an increasing perception, understanding and concern in academic circles as well as in other sectors of society that the unsustainable production and consumption of natural resources need to be tackled by novel approaches. These combined efforts should ensure that they will be enacted in policy initiatives and in the actions that pave the way to building a global biodiplomacy. This new biodiplomacy should have the courage to develop and act in the interests of the human population overall, and not be undone by the legitimate but narrower interests of any single national priority. This article concludes by highlighting some of the key elements needed to give a biodiplomacy a chance to address, effectively, responsibly and synergistically, the current global challenges that affect mankind.","Aguilar, Alfredo; Patermann, Christian",N Biotechnol,283,16

Using an SIV macaque model of AIDS and CNS disease, our overall goal was to assess how the expression of genes associated with immune and inflammatory responses are longitudinally changed in different organs or cells during SIV infection. To compare RNA expression of a panel of 88 immune-related genes across time points and among three tissues – spleen, mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) – we designed a set of Nanostring probes. To identify significant genes during acute SIV infection and to investigate whether these genes are tissue-specific or have global roles, we introduce a novel multiplexed component analysis (MCA) method. This combines multivariate analysis methods with multiple preprocessing methods to create a set of 12 “judges”; each judge emphasizes particular types of change in gene expression to which cells could respond, for example, the absolute or relative size of expression change from baseline. Compared to bivariate analysis methods, our MCA method improved classification rates. This analysis allows us to identify three categories of genes: (a) consensus genes likely to contribute highly to the immune response; (b) genes that would contribute highly to the immune response only if certain assumptions are met – e.g. that the cell responds to relative expression change rather than absolute expression change; and (c) genes whose contribution to immune response appears to be modest. We then compared the results across the three tissues of interest; some genes are consistently highly-contributing in all tissues, while others are specific for certain tissues. Our analysis identified CCL8, CXCL10, CXCL11, MxA, OAS2, and OAS1 as top contributing genes, all of which are stimulated by type I interferon. This suggests that the cytokine storm during acute SIV infection is a systemic innate immune response against viral replication. Furthermore, these genes have approximately equal contributions to all tissues, making them possible candidates to be used as non-invasive biomarkers in studying PBMCs instead of MLN and spleen during acute SIV infection experiments. We identified clusters of genes that co-vary together and studied their correlation with regard to other gene clusters. We also developed novel methods to faithfully visualize multi-gene correlations on two-dimensional polar plots, and to visualize tissue specificity of gene expression responses.","Hosseini, Iraj; Gama, Lucio; Mac Gabhann, Feilim",PLoS One,283,28

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using a representative healthcare claims database of approx. 4 million adults to estimate the incidence rates (IR) and associated mortality of CAP in 2015. IR and mortality were stratified by treatment setting, age group, and risk group status. A pneumonia coded in the primary diagnosis position or in the second diagnosis position with another pneumonia-related condition coded in the primary position was used as the base cases definition for the study. Sensitivity analyses using broader and more restrictive case definitions were also performed. RESULTS: The overall IR of CAP in adults ≥18 years was 1,054 cases per 100,000 person-years of observation. In adults aged 16 to 59 years, IR for overall CAP, hospitalized CAP and outpatient CAP was 551, 96 and 466 (with a hospitalization rate of 17%). In adults aged ≥60 years, the respective IR were 2,032, 1,061 and 1,053 (with a hospitalization rate of 52%). If any pneumonia coded in the primary or secondary diagnosis position was considered for hospitalized patients, the IR increased 1.5-fold to 1,560 in the elderly ≥60 years. The incidence of CAP hospitalizations was substantially higher in adults ≥18 years with at-risk conditions and high-risk conditions (IR of 608 and 1,552, respectively), compared to adults without underlying risk conditions (IR 108). High mortality of hospitalized CAP in adults ≥18 was observed in-hospital (18.5%), at 30 days (22.9%) and at one-year (44.5%) after CAP onset. Mortality was more than double in older adults in comparison to younger patients. CONCLUSION: CAP burden in older adults and individuals with underlying risk conditions was high. Maximizing uptake of existing vaccines for respiratory diseases may help to mitigate the disease burden, especially in times of strained healthcare resources.","Theilacker, Christian; Sprenger, Ralf; Leverkus, Friedhelm; Walker, Jochen; Häckl, Dennis; von Eiff, Christof; Schiffner-Rohe, Julia",PLoS One,283,24

Using a mammalian cell expression system, a genetically engineered sensor of fluorescent protein (Gamillus)‐fused SARS‐CoV‐2 spike trimer (STG) to probe the viral entry process is developed. In ACE2‐expressing cells, it is found that the STG probe has excellent performance in the live‐cell visualization of receptor binding, cellular uptake, and intracellular trafficking of SARS‐CoV‐2 under virus‐free conditions.

Antioxidant activity (DPPH) and total polyphenol content (TPC) were monitored as responses. The TPC and DPPH were 71.98 ± 0.33 mg GAE/100 mL extract and 80.63 ± 0.49 mg TE/100mL extract respectively under optimal conditions (solid/liquid ratio = 5, temperature = 93.8 °C and time 11.3 min). The evaluation of phenolic compounds and volatile compounds of C. citratus extract at conditions for optimum extraction revealed that caffeic (20.81 ± 0.003 mg/100mL) and syringic acids (18.63 ± 7.390 mg/100mL) were the main phenolic compounds while citral and geraniol were the primary volatile compounds. The results achieved herein suits the potential use of C. citratus extract as natural source of antioxidant and aroma compounds that can be employed in different industrial sectors.

Bone mineral content (BMC) in the proximal end of the tibia was significantly decreased (14%) in OVX rats, and MU314 (100 μg/kg) and E2 significantly suppressed the decline in BMC. OVX rats exhibited decreased cancellous bone in the proximal end of the tibia and induced destruction of its trabecular structure. MU314 suppressed these changes. OVX also reduced the mechanical strength of the femoral neck, which was also recovered by MU314 and E2. E2 completely protected against OVX-induced uterine atrophy, but MU314 had no effect. These results strongly indicate that MU314 acts as a selective estrogen receptor modulator.","Fukuyama, Ryo; Shimokawa, Akio; Kodama, Yasushi; Fujita, Mitsugu; Ohishi, Yoshitaka; Ando, Yuko; Koida, Masao; Nakamuta, Hiromichi",Journal of Pharmacological Sciences,283,1

The objective of this research is to model the economic consequences of the epidemic and also to highlight the importance of the containment policy in facilitating economic recovery in Morocco. The results obtained using a combination of Ramsey's model and the epidemiological propagation model affirm that the choice of the containment policy made it possible to reduce the negative repercussions of the pandemic on Morocco, despite the economic consequences of the latter. The comparisons made between the two situations confirm that the economic repercussions remain moderate and Morocco will be able to face this disaster with even stricter or even more intelligent containment.","Firano, Zakaria; Fatine, Filali Adib",One Health,283,9

Proven communications of the gut microbiota with the pulmonary microbiota (gut–lung axis) and the pathway of neural connections between the gut and brain (gut–brain axis) may be important in the face of the pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 was shown to affect almost all organs because of the presence of a host receptor known as angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The ACE2 receptor is mainly present in the brush border of intestinal enterocytes, ciliary cells, and type II alveolar epithelial cells in the lungs. The transport function of ACE2 has been linked to the ecology of gut microbes in the digestive tract, suggesting that COVID-19 may be related to the gut microbiota. The severity of COVID-19 may be associated with a number of comorbidities, such as hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and/or old age; therefore, attention is also paid to multiple morbidities and the modulation of microbiota through comorbidities and medications. This paper reviews the research in the context of the state of the intestinal microbiota and its impact on the cells of the immune system during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","Jabczyk, Marzena; Nowak, Justyna; Hudzik, Bartosz; Zubelewicz-Szkodzińska, Barbara",J Clin Med,283,26

DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: We describe a theory-driven approach to co-designing an intervention by adapting and integrating Experience-based Co-design (EBCD) with the Behaviour Change Wheel (BCW). Our case study was informed by the results of a systematic integrative review and guided by this integrated approach. We undertook 80 hours of non-participant observations, and semistructured interviews with 14 service users (7 of which were filmed), 2 carers and 12 clinicians from the same acute ward. The facilitated intervention co-design process involved two feedback workshops, one joint co-design workshop and seven small co-design team meetings. Data analysis comprised the identification of touchpoints and use of the BCW and behaviour change technique taxonomy to inform intervention development. SETTING: This study was conducted over 12 months at an acute mental health organisation in England. RESULTS: The co-designed Let’s Talk toolkit addressed four joint service user/clinician priorities for change: (1) improve communication with withdrawn people; (2) nurses to help service users help themselves; (3) nurses to feel confident when engaging with service users; (4) improving team relations and ward culture. Intervention functions included training, education, enablement, coercion and persuasion; 14 behaviour change techniques supported these functions. We detail how we implemented our integrated co-design-behaviour change approach with service users, carers and clinicians to develop a toolkit to improve nurse–patient therapeutic engagement. CONCLUSIONS: Our theory-driven approach enhanced both EBCD and the BCW. It introduces a robust theoretical approach to guide intervention development within the co-design process and sets out how to meaningfully involve service users and other stakeholders when designing and implementing complex interventions.","McAllister, Sarah; Simpson, Alan; Tsianakas, Vicki; Canham, Nick; De Meo, Vittoria; Stone, Cady; Robert, Glenn",BMJ Open,283,2

In this study, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of polyethylene glycol recombinant granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (PEG-rhG-CSF) compared with short-acting rhG-CSF in the dose-adjusted etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin (DA-EPOCH) regimen. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 66 patients with newly diagnosed aggressive B-cell lymphomas who received the rituximab combined with DA-EPOCH regimen and G-CSF support after chemotherapy were included in this study, including 33 patients in the PEG-rhG-CSF group during coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic and another 33 matched patients in short-acting rhG-CSF group as historic control. RESULTS: The incidence of FN and FN-related hospitalization was significantly lower in chemotherapy cycles using PEG-rhG-CSF than in those using short-acting rhG-CSF (FN incidence: 10.4% vs 20.2%, P=0.038; incidence of FN-related hospitalization: 1.7% vs 7.3%, P=0.042). Overall, the incidence of dose-escalation and dose-reduction of the DA-EPOCH regimen was similar between these two groups. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that PEG-rhG-CSF as a substitute for short-acting rhG-CSF in the DA-EPOCH regimen significantly reduced the incidence of FN and FN-related hospitalization, while simplifying neutropenia management for both patients and healthcare providers.","Wei, Chong; Zhang, Yan; Wang, Wei; Zhang, Wei",Cancer Manag Res,283,20

Evidence from China,15.180541,2.4266984,2021-06-18,"BACKGROUND: Moderate/severe cases of COVID-19 present a dysregulated immune system with T cell lymphopenia and a hyper-inflammatory state. This is a study protocol of an open-label, multi-center, double-arm, randomized, dose-finding phase I/II clinical trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, alloreactivity, and efficacy of the administration of allogeneic memory T cells and natural killer (NK) cells in COVID-19 patients with lymphopenia and/or pneumonia. The aim of the study is to determine the safety and the efficacy of the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of this treatment for patients with moderate/severe COVID-19. METHODS: In the phase I trial, 18 patients with COVID-19-related pneumonia and/or lymphopenia with no oxygen requirement or with an oxygen need of ≤ 2.5 liters per minute (lpm) in nasal cannula will be assigned to two arms, based on the biology of the donor and the patient. Treatment of arm A consists of the administration of escalating doses of memory T cells, plus standard of care (SoC). Treatment of arm B consists of the administration of escalating doses of NK cells, plus SoC. In the phase II trial, a total of 182 patients with COVID-19-related pneumonia and/or lymphopenia requiring or not oxygen supplementation but without mechanical ventilation will be allocated to arm A or B, considering HLA typing. Within each arm, they will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio. In arm A, patients will receive SoC or RP2D for memory T cells plus the SoC. In arm B, patients will receive SoC or RP2D for NK cells plus the SoC. DISCUSSION: We hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2-specific memory T-lymphocytes obtained from convalescent donors recovered from COVID-19 can be used as a passive cell immunotherapy to treat pneumonia and lymphopenia in moderate/severe patients. The lymphopenia induced by COVID-19 constitutes a therapeutic window that may facilitate donor engraftment and viral protection until recovery. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.govNCT04578210.

People with obesity are blamed for their weight, and there is a common perception that weight stigmatization is justifiable and may motivate individuals to adopt healthier behaviors. The authors of this study aimed to explore WS prevalence and factors associated with WS in a large nationwide study of Saudi Arabian adults. Methods: This study was a nationwide cross-sectional survey conducted via phone interviews in June 2020. A proportional quota-sampling technique was adopted to obtain equal distributions of participants by age and sex across the 13 regions of Saudi Arabia. In total, 6239 people were contacted, and 4709 (75.48%) responded and completed the interview. The authors of the study collected data about WS using the Arabic Weight Self-Stigma Questionnaire (WSSQ), BMI, smoking, nutritional knowledge, bariatric surgery, risk of depression, and demographic variables. Results: Participants had a mean age of 36.4 ± 13.5 (18–90), and 50.1% were female. The prevalence of higher WS was 46.4%. Among other risk factors, there was a significant association between WS and obesity (odds ratio (OR): 3.93; 95% CI: 2.83–5.44; p < 0.001), waterpipe smoking (OR: 1.80; 95% CI: 1.20–2.69; p < 0.001), bariatric surgery (OR: 2.07; 95% CI: 1.53–2.81; p < 0.001), and risk of depression (OR: 1.68; 95% CI: 1.36–2.09; p < 0.001). Conclusion: This was the first study to explore WS and its associated factors among adults in a community setting in Saudi Arabia. This study revealed some risk factors associated with WS that may help to identify people at risk of WS and to develop interventions to reduce WS, such as improving nutritional knowledge, correcting the ideas about bariatric surgery and obesity in general, and ceasing waterpipe smoking.","Althumiri, Nora A.; Basyouni, Mada H.; AlMousa, Norah; AlJuwaysim, Mohammed F.; Alhamdan, Adel A.; Al-Qahtani, Faisal Saeed; BinDhim, Nasser F.; Alqahtani, Saleh A.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,283,1

Among HCWs, prolonged COVID symptoms could lead to the inability to perform work tasks. The aim of this study is to investigate 35-day long-COVID (35-LC) characteristics and risk factors in a one-year period. Methods: We carried out a retrospective cohort study during the COVID-19 pandemic at University Hospital of Bari. A total of 5750 HCWs were tested for close contact with a confirmed case, in the absence of personal protective equipment, or for symptom development. Results: Each positive HCW was investigated for cardiovascular risk factors or respiratory diseases. An amount of 352 HCWs (6.1%) were infected by SARS-CoV-2, and 168 cases evolved to long COVID. The 35-LC group showed mean BMI values higher than the non-35-LC group (25.9 kg/m(2) vs. 24.8 kg/m(2), respectively), and this difference was significant (p-value: 0.020).

Research into previous infectious disease outbreaks has shown that healthcare workers are at increased risk for burnout during these dire times, with those on the front lines at greatest risk. The purpose of this prospective study was to determine the effect that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on the wellness of emergency physicians (EP). METHODS: A survey was sent to 137 EPs in a multi-hospital network in eastern Pennsylvania. We compared 10 primary and two supplemental questions based on how the physicians had been feeling in the prior 2–3 weeks (COVID-19 period) to the same questions based on how they were feeling in the prior 4–6 months (pre-COVID-19 period). RESULTS: We received 55 responses to the survey (40.1% response rate). The study found that during the pandemic, EPs felt less in control (p-value = 0.001); felt decreased happiness while at work (p-value 0.001); had more trouble falling asleep (p-value = 0.001); had an increased sense of dread when thinking of work needing to be done (p-value = 0.04); felt more stress on days not at work (p-value <0.0001); and were more concerned about their own health (p-value <0.0001) and the health of their families and loved ones (p-value <0.0001). CONCLUSION: This study showed a statistically significant decrease in EP wellness during the COVID-19 pandemic when compared to the pre-pandemic period.

We aim to report outcomes for children with LD and LT enrolled in the NASPGHAN/SPLIT SARS-CoV2 registry. METHODS: In this multicenter observational cohort study, we collected data from 91 patients <21 years (LD 44, LT 47) with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV2 infection between April 21 and September 17, 2020. RESULTS: Patients with LD were more likely to require admission (70% vs 43% LT, P = 0.007) and pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) management (32% vs 4% LT, P = 0.001). Seven LD patients required mechanical ventilation (MV) and 2 patients died; no patients in the LT cohort died or required MV. Four LD patients presented in pediatric acute liver failure (PALF), 2 with concurrent multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C); all recovered without LT.

Then, the control reproduction number of general population epidemic model is obtained. Based on the epidemic model of general population, the epidemic model of general population and college population is further established, and the control reproduction number is also obtained. METHODS: For the established epidemic model, firstly, the expression of the control reproduction number is obtained by using the next generation matrix. Secondly, the real-time reported data of COVID-19 in Shaanxi Province is used to fit the epidemic model, and the parameters in the model are estimated by least square method and MCMC. Thirdly, the Latin hypercube sampling method and partial rank correlation coefficient (PRCC) are adopted to analyze the sensitivity of the model. CONCLUSIONS: The control reproduction number remained at 3 from January 23 to January 31, then gradually decreased from 3 to slightly greater than 0.2 by using the real-time reports on the number of COVID-19 infected cases from Health Committee of Shaanxi Province in China. In order to further control the spread of the epidemic, the following measures can be taken: (i) reducing infection by wearing masks, paying attention to personal hygiene and limiting travel; (ii) improving isolation of suspected patients and treatment of symptomatic individuals.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the variables attributable to the fear of contracting COVID‐19. DESIGN: This is a quantitative study based on an online cross‐sectional self‐administered survey in Chile between 10 July 2020 and 10 August 2020. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A sample of 531, comprising over 18‐year‐old participants from middle‐ and high‐income levels, was selected. OUTCOME MEASURES: Estimations were obtained using a probit regression model with marginal effects. RESULTS: Fear prevailed mainly in women. It has a positive relationship with variables such as chronic illnesses, infectious family or relatives, reduction in economic activity and perception of bad government response to a pandemic. Fear has a negative relationship with knowledge about COVID‐19, education level and ageing. Moreover, those who consider socioeconomic impact less important than health care do not fear a COVID‐19 infection. DISCUSSIONAND CONCLUSION: The socioeconomic and health aspects help predict fears. Thus, the government should prioritize these variables in implementing policies. The government's credibility and communication systems can also reduce fears of contracting COVID‐19. PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: A pilot focus group of COVID‐19–recuperated individuals and some members of our interest groups were consulted in the design stage of the study; this helped in constructing the survey questions. Additionally, three independent individuals volunteered to read and comment on the draft manuscript.","Cerda, Arcadio A.; García, Leidy Y.",Health Expect,283,10

Early detection of COVID-19 positive patients and timely isolation of the patients are essential to prevent its spread. Chest X-ray images of COVID-19 patients often show the characteristics of multifocality, bilateral hairy glass turbidity, patchy network turbidity, etc. It is crucial to design a method to automatically identify COVID-19 from chest X-ray images to help diagnosis and prognosis. Existing studies for the classification of COVID-19 rarely consider the role of attention mechanisms on the classification of chest X-ray images and fail to capture the cross-channel and cross-spatial interrelationships in multiple scopes. This paper proposes a multi-kernel-size spatial-channel attention method to detect COVID-19 from chest X-ray images. Our proposed method consists of three stages. The first stage is feature extraction. The second stage contains two parallel multi-kernel-size attention modules: multi-kernel-size spatial attention and multi-kernel-size channel attention. The two modules capture the cross-channel and cross-spatial interrelationships in multiple scopes using multiple 1D and 2D convolutional kernels of different sizes to obtain channel and spatial attention feature maps. The third stage is the classification module. We integrate the chest X-ray images from three public datasets: COVID-19 Chest X-ray Dataset Initiative, ActualMed COVID-19 Chest X-ray Dataset Initiative, and COVID-19 radiography database for evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method improves the performance of COVID-19 detection and achieves an accuracy of 98.2%.","Fan, Yuqi; Liu, Jiahao; Yao, Ruixuan; Yuan, Xiaohui",Pattern Recognit,283,24

The influence of meteorological factors on the transmission and spread of COVID-19 is of interest. This study sought to examine the associations of daily average temperature (AT) and relative humidity (ARH) with the daily count of COVID-19 cases in 30 Chinese provinces (in Hubei from December 1, 2019 to February 11, 2020 and in other provinces from January 20, 2020 to Februarys 11, 2020). A Generalized Additive Model (GAM) was fitted to quantify the province-specific associations between meteorological variables and the daily cases of COVID-19 during the study periods. In the model, the 14-day exponential moving averages (EMAs) of AT and ARH, and their interaction were included with time trend and health-seeking behavior adjusted. Their spatial distributions were visualized. AT and ARH showed significantly negative associations with COVID-19 with a significant interaction between them (0.04, 95% confidence interval: 0.004–0.07) in Hubei. Every 1 °C increase in the AT led to a decrease in the daily confirmed cases by 36% to 57% when ARH was in the range from 67% to 85.5%. Every 1% increase in ARH led to a decrease in the daily confirmed cases by 11% to 22% when AT was in the range from 5.04 °C to 8.2 °C. However, these associations were not consistent throughout Mainland China.","Qi, Hongchao; Xiao, Shuang; Shi, Runye; Ward, Michael P.; Chen, Yue; Tu, Wei; Su, Qing; Wang, Wenge; Wang, Xinyi; Zhang, Zhijie",Sci Total Environ,283,1

To control the pandemic, the One Health approach (https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/one-health) is very important. We herein provide a real-world example of efficient COVID-19 control in Anhui Province, China with outbreak originating from imported cases through implementation of a series of measures as part of the One Health approach and describe the stratified cases features. METHODS: Since the identification of the first imported COVID-19 case on Jan 22, 2020, Anhui immediately initiated a sequence of systematic and forceful interventions. We detailed the control measures and analyzed the effects as demonstrated by the corresponding temporal changes of overall epidemiology data on confirmed, cured, and hospitalized cases and contacts. An accumulated number of 991 cases were confirmed, with a total number of 29,399 contacts traced. We further retrieved individual-level data of confirmed cases and compared them across stratifications by sex, age group, linkage to Wuhan, and period of diagnosis. RESULTS: With a series of interventions including active field investigation, case tracing, quarantine, centralization, education, closed management, and boundary control implemented, number of hospitalized COVID-19 cases peaked, new case disappeared, and all cases were discharged 21, 36, and 46 days after the identification of the initial case, respectively. Male patients were younger, more often had linkage to Wuhan, and received timelier care, but less often had infected cohabitants. Patients aged 25–44 years most often had linkage to Wuhan, while such frequency was lowest in those ≥65 years. Cases <25 years most often had a known contact with COVID-19 patients and any infected family member and cohabitant and were beforehand quarantined, and received fastest management. Patients with linkage to Wuhan were younger, less often had infected family member, had longer incubation period, and received earlier quarantine and timelier care. With more recent periods, the proportion of cases with linkage to Wuhan markedly decreased while the proportion of cases with known contact with COVID-19 cases dramatically increased; the proportions of patients with any infected family member or cohabitant, those beforehand quarantined, and those taking drugs before admission increased; incubation period lengthened, and patients received timelier professional care. Nonspecific systemic symptoms were most common, whose proportion decreased in more recent periods. CONCLUSIONS: Timely and powerful measures as part of the One Health approach (https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/one-health) effectively and efficiently controlled the COVID-19 outbreak in Anhui, which can be a good real-world example strongly demonstrating the usefulness of such measures in places with outbreaks originating from imported cases. Precise and dynamic prevention and control measures should be implemented and based on features including sex, age group, exposure history, and phase of outbreak.","Huang, Lei; Zhang, Xinyue; Xu, Aman",One Health,283,14

Macrophages trigger inflammation to eliminate pathogens and repair tissue, but this process can also lead to hyperinflammation and resulting exaggerated disease. The role of macrophages in dysregulated inflammation during SARS-CoV-2 infection is poorly understood. We used SARS-CoV-2 infected and glycosylated soluble SARS-CoV-2 Spike S1 subunit (S1) treated THP-1 human-derived macrophage-like cell line to clarify the role of macrophages in pro-inflammatory responses. Soluble S1 upregulated TNF-α and CXCL10 mRNAs, and induced secretion of TNF-α from THP-1 macrophages. While THP-1 macrophages did not support productive SARS-CoV-2 replication, virus infection resulted in upregulation of both TNF-α and CXCL10 genes. Our study shows that S1 is a key viral component inducing inflammatory response in macrophages, independently of virus replication. Thus, virus-infected or soluble S1-activated macrophages may become sources of pro-inflammatory mediators contributing to hyperinflammation in COVID-19 patients.","Chiok, Kim; Hutchison, Kevin; Miller, Lindsay Grace; Bose, Santanu; Miura, Tanya A.",bioRxiv,283,9

Therefore, quality standards that take into account basic scientific and journalistic principles, but are also scalable to specific health-related topics (such as medicine, nutrition and environment) are particularly relevant. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Starting from an internationally established catalogue in the framework of the “media doctor project”, criteria for good medical journalism were analysed, reclassified and completed on the basis of theoretical concepts and practical applicability. In parallel, existing criteria from medical journalism were transferred to an adapted criteria catalogue for reporting on nutrition. RESULTS: A consensus was reached on a catalogue of criteria modularised into general journalistic, general science journalistic and specific medical journalistic aspects, which is published here for the first time in a scientific paper. With some rare exceptions, quality criteria for medical journalism could be well adapted to nutritional topics. Based on the two catalogues, further media contributions have been regularly evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: The advanced modularisation of the criteria catalogues facilitates their applicability and possibly their extension to other disciplines and for use by medical doctors as well as by laypersons. While medical journalism is strongly oriented towards the criteria of scientific evidence, the role of academic studies and experts versus anecdotal evidence should be further investigated for nutritional journalism.","Anhäuser, Marcus; Wormer, Holger; Viciano, Astrid; Rögener, Wiebke",Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz,283,16

The overwhelming majority of publications focussed on polar compounds. Compounds that show promise for the inhibition of coronavirus in humans include scutellarein, silvestrol, tryptanthrin, saikosaponin B2, quercetin, myricetin, caffeic acid, psoralidin, isobavachalcone, and lectins such as griffithsin. Other compounds such as lycorine may be suitable if a therapeutic level of antiviral activity can be achieved without exceeding toxic plasma concentrations.

This was found to be a novel nucleocapsid protein that matched almost exactly one predicted by an open reading frame in the recently published nucleotide sequence of the same virus isolate (>96% coverage). A second viral protein corresponding to the predicted ∼139-kDa spike glycoprotein has also been examined by MALDI-TOF MS (42% coverage). After peptide N-glycosidase F digestion, 12 glycosylation sites in this protein were confirmed. The sugars attached to four of the sites were also identified.

Covid-19 patients can suddenly deteriorate and develop life threatening complications. Hence, there is a need to identify laboratory biomarkers in order to categorize high risk patients. The main purpose of the study is to investigate the role and correlation of laboratory parameters such as total leucocyte count (TLC), absolute lymphocyte count, platelet count, C-Reactive Proteins (CRP), serum ferritin, serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), serum procalcitonin and D-dimer in severe and non-severe Covid-19 patients. METHODOLOGY: This retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted at Latifa Women and Child Hospital in the UAE after obtaining ethical committee clearance. Based on the symptoms and the criteria by National Institute of Health, USA, 109 patients were divided into three groups: Non-severe with 75, severe with 18 and critical with 16 patients. Laboratory data of these patients were assessed through the electronic medical records (SALAMA). Statistical analysis was done using Statistical Packages for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 25.0 (SPSS/PC; SPSS-25.0, Chicago, USA). Laboratory test profiles were expressed as mean (SD). Independent ‘t’ test and ANOVA were used to study the significance of means. P value less than 0.05 was considered significant. RESULT: Males were more severely affected than females. Severe and critically ill Covid-19 patients had a significantly higher TLC, serum LDH, ferritin and CRP and lower absolute lymphocyte count.

However, it still has limitations on salt-and-pepper noise corrupted images and uneven illumination images. To alleviate these limitations and improve the overall performance, here we propose an improved 2D Otsu's algorithm to increase the robustness to salt-and-pepper noise together with an adaptive energy based image partition technology for uneven illumination image segmentation. Based on the partition method, two schemes for automatic thresholding are adopted to find the best segmentation result. Experiments are conducted on both synthetic and real world uneven illumination images as well as real world regular illumination cell images. Original 2D Otsu's method, MAOTSU_2D, and two latest 1D Otsu's methods (Cao's method and DVE) are included for comparisons. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations are introduced to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Results show that the proposed method is more robust to salt-and-pepper noise and acquires better segmentation results on uneven illumination images in general without compromising its performance on regular illumination images.

PAD4 is expressed in neutrophils that, when activated, can drive the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Uncontrolled activation of PAD4 and subsequent citrullination of proteins is increasingly recognized as a driver of (auto)immune diseases. Currently, our understanding of PAD4 structure–function relationships and activity control in vivo is incomplete. Aims: To provide the current state‐of‐the‐art on PAD4 structure‐activity relationships and involvement of PAD4 in autoimmune disorders as well as in thrombo‐inflammatory disease. Materials & Methods: Literature review and molecular modelling Results: In this review, we used molecular modelling to generate a three‐dimensional structure of the complete PAD4 molecule. Using our model, we discuss the catalytic conversion of the arginine substrate to citrulline. Besides mechanistic insight into PAD4 function, we give an overview of biological functions of PAD4 and mechanisms that influence its activation. In addition, we discuss the crucial role of PAD4‐mediated citrullination of histones during the formation of NETs. Subsequently, we focus on the role of PAD4‐mediated NET formation and its role in pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis, sepsis and (immune‐)thrombosis. Finally, we summarize current efforts to design different classes of PAD4 inhibitors that are being developed for improved treatment of autoimmune disorders as well as thrombo‐inflammatory disease. Discussion: Advances in PAD4 structure‐function are still necessary to gain a complete insight in mechanisms that control PAD4 activity in vivo. The involvement of PAD4 in several diseases signifies the need for a PAD4 inhibitor. Although progress has been made to produce an isotype specific and potent PAD4 inhibitor, currently no PAD4 inhibitor is ready for clinical use. Conclusion: More research into PAD4 structure and function and into the regulation of its activity is required for the development of PAD4 specific inhibitors that may prove vital to combat and prevent autoimmune disorders and (thrombo)inflammatory disease.","Liu, Xiaosong; Arfman, Tom; Wichapong, Kanin; Reutelingsperger, Chris P.

The use of these devices has the theoretical risk of increased exposure risk because of possible particulate generation. This study aimed to quantify the particulate generation associated with different oxygen devices. METHODS: This was a prospective single center study conducted during September 2020 using ten healthy adult volunteers. Testing was conducted in a negative pressure hospital room using a light scattering particle counter. The oxygen devices used were a nasal cannula, an OxyMask™, a non-rebreathing mask, and a high flow system. Particle measurements were obtained at baseline in the room and then with each oxygen delivery device and pre-specified oxygen flow rates. These measurements were obtained different distances from the volunteer with their mouth open. A Wilcoxon/Kruskal-Wallis test was performed on each separate oxygen modality with all flow rates as one model. RESULTS: The particle concentrations were slightly non-significantly increased with the OxyMask™ and non-rebreathing mask at the closest distance measured. As the distance increased, these counts decreased closer to ambient levels. The nasal cannula and high flow nasal cannula particle counts were not significantly different from ambient measurements at either distance. CONCLUSION: Nasal cannula, OxyMask™, non-rebreathing mask, and high flow oxygen did not generate any additional aerosols or droplets above a baseline room measurement, but further studies are necessary to determine infectious risk.","Helgeson, Scott A.; Lee, Augustine S.; Lim, Kaiser G.; Niven, Alexander S.; Patel, Neal M.",Respir Med,283,1

Oral healthcare is essential to the health and well-being of elders and is one of the key indicators determining their quality of life. This research aimed to study oral health literacy, self-efficacy, social support, and demographic characteristic factors associated with the oral health care behaviors of elderly people living in the rural areas of northern Thailand. METHODS: This research was a cross-sectional study that recruited 406 elderly participants using convenience and snowball samplings. Participants’ names were obtained from the registration list of the Java Health Center Information System (JHCIS) program, where they received a health service between 2018 and 2020. Data were obtained through face-to-face interviews with participants, while they were waiting to receive a health service or through a phone interview. Linear regression was analyzed to determine the factors associated with oral healthcare behaviors. RESULTS: The majority of participants (85%) had inadequate functional health literacy, 52% had moderate self-efficacy toward oral health behaviors, 91.9% had moderate social support, and 53% admitted to moderate oral health behaviors. The results from the model show that self-efficacy, social support, and oral health literacy are positively associated with oral health care behaviors among the elderly (p-value < 0.05). The multiple regression model can account for 47.2% of the variance in oral health care behaviors. CONCLUSION: Improving oral health care behaviors among elderly people should be considered by health care providers and those who provide social support. Self-esteem, communication skills among service providers and service receivers, and self-management of oral healthcare should receive special attention. Moreover, social support and relevant agencies can help promote oral healthcare by collaborating with other healthcare providers for better oral health outcomes among elderly people.","Khamrin, Pattaraporn; Boonyathee, Sorawit; Bootsikeaw, Sasivimol; Ong-Artborirak, Parichat; Seangpraw, Katekaew",Clin Interv Aging,283,16

To this end, many approaches have been proposed to predict the partner-selecting amino acid positions in evolutionarily close complexes. These approaches can be grouped into sequence-based machine learning and structure-based energy-driven methods. In this work, we assessed these methods’ ability to map the specificity-determining positions of Axl, a receptor tyrosine kinase involved in cancer progression and immune system diseases. For sequence-based predictions, we used SDPpred, Multi-RELIEF, and Sequence Harmony. For structure-based predictions, we utilized HADDOCK refinement and molecular dynamics simulations. As a result, we observed that (i) sequence-based methods overpredict partner-selecting residues of Axl and that (ii) combining Multi-RELIEF with HADDOCK-based predictions provides the key Axl residues, covered by the extensive molecular dynamics simulations. Expanding on these results, we propose that a sequence-structure-based approach is necessary to determine specificity-determining positions of Axl, which can guide the development of therapeutic molecules to combat Axl misregulation.","Karakulak, Tülay; Rifaioglu, Ahmet Sureyya; Rodrigues, João P.

Using the health crisis management framework, the CNSs demonstrated authentic leadership throughout the prevention, preparedness, response, recovery, and rehabilitation phases. OUTCOME Data analysis of CNS handoff and meeting communications generated these areas of focus involving the CNSs: (1) clinical practice, (2) supplies, (3) workflows, and (4) people. CONCLUSION The CNS played a vital role in the planning, training, and evaluation of crisis preparation. New and emerging infectious diseases may continue to confront the healthcare system. Thus, healthcare systems need to remain prepared for public health threats. In the crisis leadership role, the CNS helped the transition to learn and relearn practices. As authentic leaders, CNSs instilled calmness, confidence, trust, and resiliency to the staff during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Ladak, Anila; Lee, Betty; Sasinski, Juliet",Clinical nurse specialist CNS,283,16

Colchicine achieves anti inflammatory activity through tubulin disruption and the inhibition of leucocyte mediated inflammatory activities (such as the production of superoxide and release of various cytokines), which are central to the pathophysiology of COVID 19. Accordingly, this systematic review and meta analysis provides an assessment of currently available data pertaining to the use of colchicine for the treatment of COVID 19. Three studies (two RCTS and one observational) were included in the review, totaling 402 patients of whom 194 received colchicine. The random effect model showed the overall pooled OR to be 0.32 (95% CI: 0.18 to 0.56) for the primary outcome (clinical deterioration), which was statistically significant (p < 0.0001). Further, there was an increase in adverse effects (diarrhea) with the use of colchicine, as suggested by the pooled OR (OR = 4.56, 95% CI: 2.04 to 10.15, P = 0.0002). Despite the limited number of available studies, a statistically significant reduction of clinical deterioration in COVID 19 patients was revealed. However, there was an increase in adverse effects in the form of diarrhea, which was mild and self limiting.

The leader and trailer non-coding regions of the EBOV genome likely regulate its transcription, replication, and progeny genome packaging. We investigated the cis-acting RNA signals involved in RNA–RNA and RNA–protein interactions that regulate replication of eGFP-encoding EBOV minigenomic RNA and identified heat shock cognate protein family A (HSC70) member 8 (HSPA8) as an EBOV trailer-interacting host protein. Mutational analysis of the trailer HSPA8 binding motif revealed that this interaction is essential for EBOV minigenome replication. Selective 2′-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension analysis of the secondary structure of the EBOV minigenomic RNA indicates formation of a small stem-loop composed of the HSPA8 motif, a 3′ stem-loop (nucleotides 1868–1890) that is similar to a previously identified structure in the replicative intermediate (RI) RNA and a panhandle domain involving a trailer-to-leader interaction.

The purpose of this study was to assess HCP willingness to get vaccinated and identify specific concerns that would undermine vaccination efforts. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of HCP, including clinical and non-clinical staff, researchers, and trainees between November 23 (rd) ,2020 and December 5 (th) ,2020. The survey evaluated attitudes, beliefs and willingness to get vaccinated. RESULTS: A total of 5287 respondents had a mean age of 42.5 years (SD=13.56), and were 72.8% female (n=3842). Overall 57.5 % of individuals expressed intent to receive COVID-19 vaccine. 80.4% were physicians and scientists representing the largest group. 33.6% of registered nurses, 31.6% of allied health professionals, and 32% of master’s level clinicians were unsure they would take the vaccine (p<.001). Respondents who were older, males, White, or Asian were more likely to get vaccinated compared to other groups. Vaccine safety, potential adverse events, efficacy and speed of vaccine development dominated concerns listed by participants. Fewer (54.0%) providers of direct care vs. non-care providers (62.4%), and 52.0% of those who had provided care for COVID-19 patients (vs. 60.6% of those who had not) indicated they would take the vaccine if offered (p<.001). CONCLUSIONS: We observed that self-reported willingness to receive vaccination against COVID-19 differs by hospital roles, with physicians and research scientists showing the highest acceptance. These findings highlight important heterogeneity in personal attitudes among HCPs around COVID-19 vaccines and highlight a need for tailored communication strategies.","Shaw, Jana; Stewart, Telisa; Anderson, Kathryn B; Hanley, Samantha; Thomas, Stephen J; Salmon, Daniel A; Morley, Christopher",Clin Infect Dis,283,24

In this paper, we explore strategies that such institutions can adopt to conduct safe reopening and resume operations during the pandemic. The research is motivated by the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign’s (UIUC’s) SHIELD program, which is a set of policies and strategies, including rapid saliva-based COVID-19 screening, for ensuring safety of students, faculty and staff to conduct in-person operations, at least partially. Specifically, we study how rapid bulk testing, contact tracing and preventative measures such as mask wearing, sanitization, and enforcement of social distancing can allow institutions to manage the epidemic spread. This work combines the power of analytical epidemic modeling, data analysis and agent-based simulations to derive policy insights. We develop an analytical model that takes into account the asymptomatic transmission of COVID-19, the effect of isolation via testing (both in bulk and through contact tracing) and the rate of contacts among people within and outside the institution. Next, we use data from the UIUC SHIELD program and 85 other universities to estimate parameters that describe the analytical model. Using the estimated parameters, we finally conduct agent-based simulations with various model parameters to evaluate testing and reopening strategies. The parameter estimates from UIUC and other universities show similar trends. For example, infection rates at various institutions grow rapidly in certain months and this growth correlates positively with infection rates in counties where the universities are located. Infection rates are also shown to be negatively correlated with testing rates at the institutions. Through agent-based simulations, we demonstrate that the key to designing an effective reopening strategy is a combination of rapid bulk testing and effective preventative measures such as mask wearing and social distancing. Multiple other factors help to reduce infection load, such as efficient contact tracing, reduced delay between testing and result revelation, tests with less false negatives and targeted testing of high-risk class among others. This paper contributes to the nascent literature on combating the COVID-19 pandemic and is especially relevant for educational institutions and similarly large organizations. We contribute by providing an analytical model that can be used to estimate key parameters from data, which in turn can be used to simulate the effect of different strategies for reopening. We quantify the relative effect of different strategies such as bulk testing, contact tracing, reduced infectivity and contact rates in the context of educational institutions. Specifically, we show that for the estimated average base infectivity of 0.025 ([Formula: see text] ), a daily number of tests to population ratio T/N of 0.2, i.e., once a week testing for all individuals, is a good indicative threshold. However, this test to population ratio is sensitive to external infectivities, internal and external mobilities, delay in getting results after testing, and measures related to mask wearing and sanitization, which affect the base infection rate.","Mukherjee, Ujjal K.; Bose, Subhonmesh; Ivanov, Anton; Souyris, Sebastian; Seshadri, Sridhar; Sridhar, Padmavati; Watkins, Ronald; Xu, Yuqian",Sci Rep,283,14

To address its mission, investigators working at the CC designed two protocols to study this new disease. To protect our patients and our staff, we quickly developed infection control guidelines based on what was known about the epidemiology and pathogenesis of this new disease. RESULTS: We created a multidisciplinary team to identify risk points during the admission and treatment phases of these protocols. This group met once or twice weekly for 6 months. New policies and procedures were created which were patterned after the CDC guidelines but which met the unique needs of our existing infrastructure and patient populations. We created a new position (isolation monitor) to ensure compliance with infection control precautions. We also conducted a failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) to identify additional areas of risk. Policies and procedures were reviewed by: 1) a multi-institute physician committee, 2) an external expert in hospital epidemiology, and 3) the CC Medical Executive Committee.

The presented protocol aims to provide an approach to reduce the risk of malnutrition and improve the clinical outcomes. METHODS: : Short age-adjusted Nutritional Risk Screening was performed for all 94 non-ICU patients admitted to the Giovanni Borea Civil Hospital in Sanremo. The 49 ICU patients were considered at risk of malnutrition without screening and were fed with EN plus supplemental PN. In non-ICU setting, patients underwent a personalized nutritional protocol, considering their conditions, which consisted of a high-protein and high-calories pureed diet, Oral Nutritional Supplements and/or Artificial Nutrition or other personalized nutritional path. RESULTS: : The nutritional treatment was well tolerated by patients. The 19.1% of non-ICU patients died, they were mainly women, with higher BMI and older in age. On the other hand, the 53.1% of ICU patients died. The non-ICU patients scoring positive on at least one nutritional risk screening item (excluding age) were 72 out of 94. Patients > 70 years old were 68 out of 94. Non-ICU patients who did not meet their energy and protein needs were older (P=0.01) and died more frequently (P <0.001).

OBJECTIVES: To analyze the kinetics of T-lymphocyte subsets in LTR and the association between nadir CD4 T-cell count and viral infections after transplantation. STUDY DESIGN: Serial measurements of peripheral blood CD4 and CD8 T-cell counts obtained during the first year post-transplantation from 83 consecutive LTR and their correlation with both viral OI and community-acquired infections post-transplantation were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: LTR with a nadir CD4 T-cell count <200 cells/μl had consistently lower CD4 and CD8 T-cell counts than LTR with a nadir CD4 T-cell count >200 cells/μl (p < 0.001).

We used a combination of classic epidemiological methods, natural language processing (NLP), and machine learning (for predictive modeling), to analyse the electronic health records (EHRs) of patients with COVID-19. We explored the unstructured free text in the EHRs within the SESCAM Healthcare Network (Castilla La-Mancha, Spain) from the entire population with available EHRs (1,364,924 patients) from January 1st to March 29th, 2020. We extracted related clinical information upon diagnosis, progression and outcome for all COVID-19 cases, focusing in those requiring ICU admission. A total of 10,504 patients with a clinical or PCR-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 were identified, 52.5% males, with a mean age of 58.2 and S.D. 19.7 years. Upon admission, the most common symptoms were cough, fever, and dyspnoea, but all in less than half of cases. Overall, 6% of hospitalized patients required ICU admission. Using a machine-learning, data-driven algorithm we identified that a combination of age, fever, and tachypnoea was the most parsimonious predictor of ICU admission: those younger than 56 years, without tachypnoea, and temperature <39 C, (or >39 C without respiratory crackles), were free of ICU admission. On the contrary, COVID-19 patients aged 40 to 79 years were likely to be admitted to the ICU if they had tachypnoea and delayed their visit to the ER after being seen in primary care. Our results show that a combination of easily obtainable clinical variables (age, fever, and tachypnoea with/without respiratory crackles) predicts which COVID-19 patients require ICU admission.","Izquierdo, Jose Luis; Ancochea, Julio; Group, - Savana COVID-19 Research; Soriano, Joan B",,283,26

Wuhan had a much higher mortality rate than the rest of China. However, a large number of asymptomatic infections in Wuhan may have never been diagnosed, contributing to an overestimated mortality rate. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to obtain an accurate estimate of infections in Wuhan using internet data. METHODS: In this study, we performed a combined analysis of the infection rate among evacuated foreign citizens to estimate the infection rate in Wuhan in late January and early February. RESULTS: Based on our analysis, the combined infection rate of the foreign evacuees was 0.013 (95% CI 0.008-0.022). Therefore, we estimate the number of infected people in Wuhan to be 143,000 (range 88,000-242,000), which is significantly higher than previous estimates. Our study indicates that a large number of infections in Wuhan were not diagnosed, which has resulted in an overestimated case fatality rate. CONCLUSIONS: Increased awareness of the original infection rate of Wuhan is critical for proper public health measures at all levels, as well as to eliminate panic caused by overestimated mortality rates that may bias health policy actions by the authorities.","Qu, Hui-Qi; Cheng, Zhangkai Jason; Duan, Zhifeng; Tian, Lifeng; Hakonarson, Hakon",J Med Internet Res,283,16

In older children, several cases of diabetic ketoacidosis were reported. Our results show that delaying care can lead to seriously ill children, life-threatening situations and that in some cases it can even lead to death. If we want to avoid such a delay at a possible second peak of Corona, general care providers and paediatricians have to join forces and find new ways of working.

The crown-like spikes on the surface of the virion are the unique structural feature of viruses in the family Coronaviridae. The spike (S) protein adopts distinct conformations while mediating entry of the virus into the host. This multifunctional protein mediates the entry process by recognizing its receptor on the host cell, followed by the fusion of the viral membrane with the host cell membrane. This review article focuses on the structural and functional comparison of S proteins of the human betacoronaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Here, we review the current state of knowledge about receptor recognition, the membrane fusion mechanism, structural epitopes, and glycosylation sites of the S proteins of these viruses.

Various precautions during COVID-19 in China have kept a large number of people in isolation, and this has inconvenienced and placed enormous stress on pregnant women. Pregnant women are more likely to suffer from antenatal depression (ANDP) with social isolation or low social support. This research aims to investigate the neurobiological mechanisms underlying ANDP, which impedes early detection and intervention in this disorder. Methods: A total of 43 singleton pregnant women who experienced isolation were recruited, including 21 treatment-naïve ANDP patients and 22 healthy pregnant women (HPW). To explore the intrinsic cerebral activity alternations in ANDP using resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI), we assessed the local regional homogeneity (ReHo) differences in two groups using the voxel-based whole-brain analysis. The correlation between the regional functional abnormalities and clinical variables in ANDP patients was also examined. Results: Compared with HPW, ANDP patients showed decreased ReHo in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, right insular and the cluster coving the right ventral temporal cortex (VTC), amygdala (AMG), and hippocampus (HIP). The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) scores of ANDP patients negatively correlated with the ReHo in the right VTC, AMG, and HIP.

However, to date, we do not know how these consequences change over time. The first objective of the present study was to track changes in adjustment strategies and clinical issues among French university students at different times of the pandemic. The second objective was to investigate the psychological and situational factors contributing to students’ anxiety and depressive symptoms. Method: This cohort study was conducted between 23 April and 11 December 2020. Measurements were performed four times: during France’s first national lockdown, during the period after lockdown, when universities were open, and finally during the second national lockdown. A total of 1294 university students were initially included, and 91 students completed the four measurement points over a 7-month period. Coping strategies (with the Brief-COPE), health concerns (with two questions), anxiety and depressive symptoms (with the HADS) were measured. Results: Results showed an evolution over time of anxiety (χ(2) = 21.59 ***) and depressive (χ(2) = 29.73 ***) symptoms. Depressive symptoms are significantly higher during lockdown periods compared to unlockdown periods. Anxiety symptoms are likewise particularly high during the two lockdowns, but also when the universities reopen. At different times, anxiety and depressive symptoms were positively associated with maladaptive strategies, such as the self-blame (rho between 0.33 and 0.51) and negatively with adaptive strategies, such as the positive reframing (rho between −0.23 and −0.44). Conclusions: The trajectory of anxiety, which is elevated even in the absence of lockdown, raises concerns about the long-term effects of the pandemic on these symptoms.","Charbonnier, Elodie; Le Vigouroux, Sarah; Goncalves, Aurelie",Int J Environ Res Public Health,283,13

In the virulent Miller strain of TGEV, ORF 3b is 5′-terminal on mRNA 3–1 and is presumably translated following 5′ cap-dependent ribosomal entry. For three other strains of TGEV, the virulent British FS772/70 and Taiwanese TFI and avirulent Purdue-116, mRNA species 3–1 is not made and ORF 3b is present as a non-overlapping second ORF on mRNA 3. ORF 3b begins at base 432 on mRNA 3 in Purdue strain. In vitro expression of ORF 3b from Purdue mRNA 3-like transcripts did not fully conform to a predicted leaky scanning pattern, suggesting ribosomes might also be entering internally. With mRNA 3-like transcripts modified to carry large ORFs upstream of ORF 3a, it was demonstrated that ribosomes can reach ORF 3b by entering at a distant downstream site in a manner resembling ribosomal shunting. Deletion analysis failed to identify a postulated internal ribosomal entry structure (IRES) within ORF 3a. The results indicate that an internal entry mechanism, possibly in conjunction with leaky scanning, is used for the expression of ORF 3b from TGEV mRNA 3. One possible consequence of this feature is that ORF 3b might also be expressed from mRNAs 1 and 2.","O'Connor, Jennifer Black; Brian, David A.",Virology,283,5

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) promoting molecules such as peroxides are detrimental to many viruses, including coronaviruses. In this paper, metal decorated single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) were evaluated for hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) adsorption for potential use for designing viral inactivation surfaces. We employed first-principles methods based on the density functional theory (DFT) to investigate the capture of an individual H(2)O(2) molecule on pristine and metal (Pt, Pd, Ni, Cu, Rh, or Ru) decorated SWCNTs. Although the single H(2)O(2) molecule is weakly physisorbed on pristine SWCNT, a significant improvement on its adsorption energy was found by utilizing metal functionalized SWCNT as the adsorbent. It was revealed that Rh-SWCNT and Ru-SWCNT systems demonstrate outstanding performance for H(2)O(2) adsorption. Furthermore, we discovered through calculations that Pt- and Cu-decorated SWNCT-H(2)O(2) systems show high potential for filters for virus removal and inactivation with a very long shelf-life (2.2 × 10(12) and 1.9 × 10(8) years, respectively).

We generated a series of the full-length, reporter-tagged, clones of GLRaV-2 and demonstrated that they are systemically infectious upon agroinfection of an experimental host plant Nicotiana benthamiana. These clones and corresponding minireplicon derivatives were used to address L1 and L2 functions in GLRaV-2 infection cycle. It was found that the deletion of genome region encoding the entire L1–L2 tandem resulted in a ~ 100-fold reduction in minireplicon RNA accumulation. Five-fold reduction in RNA level was observed upon deletion of L1 coding region. In contrast, deletion of L2 coding region did not affect RNA accumulation. It was also found that the autocatalytic cleavage by L2 but not by L1 is essential for genome replication. Analysis of the corresponding mutants in the context of N. benthamiana infection launched by the full-length GLRaV-2 clone revealed that L1 or its coding region is essential for virus ability to establish infection, while L2 plays an accessory role in the viral systemic transport. Strikingly, when tagged minireplicon variants were used for the leaf agroinfiltration of the GLRaV-2 natural host, Vitis vinifera, deletion of either L1 or L2 resulted in a dramatic reduction of minireplicon ability to establish infection attesting to a host-specific requirement for tandem proteases in the virus infection cycle.","Liu, Yu-Ping; Peremyslov, Valera V.; Medina, Vicente; Dolja, Valerian V.",Virology,283,5

An inquiry into the perspectives of Japanese university educators on global citizenship education,15.361967,2.4908125,2021-06-29,"BACKGROUND: Primary care physicians have been present on the frontline during the ongoing pandemic, adding new tasks to already high workloads. Our aim was to evaluate burnout in primary care physicians during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as associated contributing factors. METHODS: Cross-sectional study with an online questionnaire disseminated through social media, applying the snowball technique. The target population was primary care physicians working in Portugal during the first outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to sociodemographic data, the questionnaire collected responses to the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (CBI), the Resilience Scale and the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales (DASS-21). Data were collected from May 9 to June 8, 2020, a period comprising the declaration of a national calamity and then state of emergency, and the subsequent ease of lockdown measures. Levels of burnout in 3 different dimensions (personal, work, and patient-related), resilience, stress, depression, and anxiety were assessed. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify factors associated with burnout levels. RESULTS: Among the 214 physician respondents, burnout levels were high in the 3 dimensions. A strong association was found between gender, years of professional experience, depression and anxiety, and burnout levels. CONCLUSIONS: Physician burnout in primary care is high and has increased during the pandemic. More studies are needed in the long term to provide a comprehensive assessment of COVID-19’simpact on burnout levels and how to best approach and mitigate it during such unprecedented times.","Baptista, Sofia; Teixeira, Andreia; Castro, Luísa; Cunha, Maria; Serrão, Carla; Rodrigues, Andreia; Duarte, Ivone",J Prim Care Community Health,283,1

It recognizes several pathogens of important public health concern. In particular, a highly polymorphic variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) at the neck-region of CLEC4M had been associated with genetic predisposition to some infectious diseases. To gain insight into the origin and evolution of this VNTR in CLEC4M, we studied 21 Africans, 20 Middle Easterns, 35 Europeans, 38 Asians, 13 Oceania, and 18 Americans (a total of 290 chromosomes) from the (Human Genome Diversity Panel) HGDP-CEPH panel; these samples covered most of alleles of this VNTR locus present in human populations. We identified a limited number of haplotypes among the basic repeat subunits that is 69 base pairs in length. Only 8 haplotypes were found. Their sequence identities were determined in the 290 chromosomes. VNTR alleles of different repeat length (from 4 to 9 repeats) were analyzed for composition and orientation of these subunits. Our results showed that the subunit configuration of the same repeat number of VNTR locus from different populations were, in fact, virtually identical. It implies that most of the VNTR alleles existed before dispersion of modern humans outside Africa. Further analyses indicate that the present diversity profile of this locus in worldwide populations is generated from the effect of migration of different tribes and neutral evolution. Our findings do not support the hypothesis that the origin of the VNTR alleles were arisen by independent (separate) mutation events and caused by differential allele advantage and natural selection as suggested by previous report based on SNP data.","Li, Hui; Wang, Jia-Xin; Wu, Dong-Dong; Wang, Hua-Wei; Tang, Nelson Leung-Sang; Zhang, Ya-Ping",PLoS One,283,20

However, subsequent domestic outbreaks of COVID-19 continue to occur. To sharp the community education program to guarantee the final success in the fight against COVID-19 in Vietnam and comparable countries, we examined the levels of COVID-19 knowledge and associated predictors among university students in Vietnam. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on all students enrolling at Phenikaa University using a self-developed questionnaire consisted of 20 questions regarding COVID-19's risk factors, transmission routes, symptoms, and prevention. RESULTS: Among 728 participants, 40.9% were male, 63.2% studied health-related majors, and 18.1% lived alone. Correct response rates ranged from 25.3% to 98.9% across 20 questions. Only 51.9% (378/728) of participants had good knowledge levels. Studying health majors (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 0.547, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.398 - 0.751, P <0.001), and living with the seniors (AOR 0.612, 95% CI 0.389 - 0.963, P = 0.034) or with friends (AOR 0.405, 95% CI 0.252 – 0.650, P <0.001) were negatively associated with a poor level of COVID-19 knowledge. CONCLUSION: The proportion of university students having good knowledge levels is suboptimal. It is essential to improve the quality of COVID-19 education with a more focus on not only the preventive measures, but also the disease itself. More studies are needed to improve the level of COVID-19 knowledge among those living alone or do not study health-related majors.","Duong, Minh Cuong; Nguyen, Hong Trang; Duong, Bich Thuy; Vu, Minh Thuy",Infect Chemother,283,19

A collective and coordinated national economic and social reconstruction effort aimed at shoring up services to promote children's MEB, like the Marshall Plan that helped rebuild Europe post-World War II, has been proposed to buttress against the expected retrenchment. The plan prioritizes children's well-being as a social objective. We propose strategically reconstructing the public safety-net systems serving youth, including early education, maternal and child health, child welfare, corrections, and mental health. That plan called for a concentrated focus on coalition-building and contracting by state mental health systems to establish a foundation for an improved health system. This paper offers a complementary set of suggestions for the four non-mental health systems mentioned above by recommending actionable steps based on scientific evidence to support improved services for children at risk for MEB problems. For each system we describe examples of evidence-informed services, policies or programs that (1) prevent disabilities and promote health, (2) protect and preserve families and neighborhoods, and (3) provide quality care. Prioritizing the promotion of children's MEB health by all state systems can shape U.S. children's health and well-being for generations to come.","Hoagwood, Kimberly Eaton; Gardner, William; Kelleher, Kelly J.",Adm Policy Ment Health,283,16

In order to impart these competencies, appropriate courses must be developed at educational institutions. In view of the rapid development of new aspects of digitization, this presents a challenge; suitable teaching formats must be developed successively. The establishment of cross-location teaching networks is one way to better meet training needs and to make the necessary spectrum of educational content available. As part of the Medical Informatics Initiative, the HiGHmed consortium is establishing such a teaching network, in the field of medical informatics, which covers many topics related to the digitization of the health care system. Various problem areas in the German education system were identified that hinder the development of the teaching network. These problem areas were prioritized firstly according to the urgency of the solution from the point of view of the HiGHmed consortium and secondly according to existing competencies in the participating societies. A workshop on the four most relevant topics was organized with experts from the German Society for Medical Informatics, Biometry and Epidemiology (GMDS), the Society for Medical Education (GMA) and the HiGHmed consortium. These are: 1. recognition of exam results from teaching modules that are offered digitally and across locations, and their integration into existing curricula; ; 2. recognition of digital, cross-location teaching in the teachers' teaching load; ; 3. nationwide uniform competencies for teachers, in order to be able to conduct digital teaching effectively and with comparable quality; ; 4. technical infrastructure to efficiently and securely communicate and manage the recognition of exam results between educational institutions. For all subject areas, existing preliminary work was identified on the basis of working questions, and short- and long-term needs for action were formulated. Finally, a need for the redesign of a technologically supported syntactic and semantic interoperability of learning performance recording was identified.","Benning, Nils-Hendrik; Haag, Martin; Knaup, Petra; Krefting, Dagmar; Rienhoff, Otto; Suhr, Markus; Hege, Inga; Tolks, Daniel",GMS J Med Educ,283,1

With little exception, each factor was predictive of incidence and mortality. The regression equation can be used to identify priority locations for preventive efforts and preparation for medical care caseloads when prevention is unsuccessful.

However, human exposure to LHQW components and their pharmacological effects remain largely unknown. Hence, this study aimed to determine human exposure to LHQW components and their anti-COVID-19 pharmacological activities. Analysis of LHQW component profiles in human plasma and urine after repeated therapeutic dosing was conducted using a combination of HRMS and an untargeted data-mining approach, leading to detection of 132 LHQW prototype and metabolite components, which were absorbed via the gastrointestinal tract and formed via biotransformation in human, respectively. Together with data from screening by comprehensive 2D angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) biochromatography, 8 components in LHQW that were exposed to human and had potential ACE2 targeting ability were identified for further pharmacodynamic evaluation. Results show that rhein, forsythoside A, forsythoside I, neochlorogenic acid and its isomers exhibited high inhibitory effect on ACE2. For the first time, this study provides chemical and biochemical evidence for exploring molecular mechanisms of therapeutic effects of LHQW capsule for the treatment of COVID-19 patients based on the components exposed to human.

However, epidemiologic transition theory is infrequently employed in epidemiology. OBJECTIVE: Moving beyond Omran's original formulation, we discuss critiques and modifications of the theory of epidemiologic transitions and highlight some of the ways in which incorporating epidemiologic transition theory can benefit theory and practice in epidemiology. DESIGN: We focus on two broad contemporary trends in human health that epidemiologic transition theory is useful for conceptualizing: the increased incidence of chronic inflammatory diseases (CIDs), such as allergic and autoimmune diseases, and the emergence and reemergence of infectious disease. RESULTS: Situating these trends within epidemiologic transition theory, we explain the rise in CIDs with the hygiene hypothesis and the rise in emerging and reemerging infections with the concept of a third epidemiologic transition. CONCLUSIONS: Contextualizing these trends within epidemiologic transition theory reveals implications for clinical practice, global health policies, and future research within epidemiology.","Zuckerman, Molly Kathleen; Harper, Kristin Nicole; Barrett, Ronald; Armelagos, George John",Glob Health Action,283,26

The mechanism of heparin binding to IFNγ and IL-6 and the resulting inhibition of their activity were studied by means of extensive molecular-dynamics simulations. The effect of LMWH on IFNγ signalling inside stimulated WISH cells was investigated by measuring its antiproliferative activity and the translocation of phosphorylated STAT1 in the nucleus. We found that LMWH binds with high affinity to IFNγ and is able to fully inhibit the interaction with its cellular receptor. It also influences the biological activity of IL-6 by binding to either IL-6 or IL-6/IL-6Rα, thus preventing the formation of the IL-6/IL-6Rα/gp130 signalling complex. These findings shed light on the molecular mechanism of the anti-inflammatory action of LMWH and underpin its ability to influence favourably conditions characterised by overexpression of these two cytokines. Such conditions are not only associated with autoimmune diseases, but also with inflammatory processes, in particular with COVID-19.

SARS-CoV-2 is the etiological agent of COVID-19 that has already spread to more than 200 countries. However, infectivity, severity, and mortality rates do not affect all countries equally. Here we consider 140 HLA alleles and extensively investigate the landscape of 3,723 potential HLA-I A and B restricted SARS-CoV-2-derived antigens and how 37 countries in the world are predicted to respond to those peptides considering their HLA-I distribution frequencies. The clustering of HLA-A and HLA-B allele frequencies partially separates most countries with the lowest number of deaths per million inhabitants from the other countries. We further correlated the patterns of in silico predicted population coverage and epidemiological data. The number of deaths per million inhabitants correlates to the predicted antigen coverage of S and N derived peptides and its module is influenced if a given set of frequent or rare HLA alleles are analyzed in a given population. Moreover, we highlighted a potential risk group carrying HLAs associated with an elevated number of deaths per million inhabitants. In addition, we identified three potential antigens bearing at least one amino acid of the four-length insertion that differentiates SARS-CoV-2 from previous coronavirus strains. We believe these data can contribute to the search for peptides with the potential to be used in vaccine strategies considering the role of herd immunity to hamper the spread of the disease.

Despite the effectiveness of community-based interventions to address this situation, the benefits thereof may disappear in the long term, due to a lack of maintenance, especially among disadvantaged and high-risk populations. The KaziBantu randomised controlled trial conducted in 2019 consisted of two school-based health interventions, KaziKidz and KaziHealth. This study will evaluate the long-term effectiveness and sustainability of these interventions in promoting positive lifestyle changes among children and educators in disadvantaged schools in Nelson Mandela Bay, South Africa, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study has an observational, longitudinal, mixed-methods design. It will follow up educators and children from the KaziBantu study. All 160 educators enrolled in KaziHealth will be invited to participate, while the study will focus on 361 KaziKidz children (aged 10–16 years) identified as having an increased risk for non-communicable diseases. Data collection will take place 1.5 and 2 years postintervention and includes quantitative and qualitative methods, such as anthropometric measurements, clinical assessments, questionnaires, interviews and focus group discussions. Analyses will encompass: prevalence of health parameters; descriptive frequencies of self-reported health behaviours and quality of life; the longitudinal association of these; extent of implementation; personal experiences with the programmes and an impact analysis based on the Reach, Efficacy, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance framework. DISCUSSION: In settings where resources are scarce, sustainable and effective prevention programmes are needed. The purpose of this protocol is to outline the design of a study to evaluate KaziKidz and KaziHealth under real-world conditions in terms of effectiveness, being long-lasting and becoming institutionalised. We hypothesise that a mixed-methods approach will increase understanding of the interventions’ capacity to lead to sustainable favourable health outcomes amid challenging environments, thereby generating evidence for policy.

In the present review, we conferred evidence of neurological complications in COVID-19 patients and shed light on the SARS-CoV-2 infection routes including the hematogenous, direct/neuronal, lymphatic tissue or cerebrospinal fluid, or infiltration through infected immune cells, while the underlying mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 invasion to the central nervous system (CNS) was also discussed. In an up-to-date manner, we further reviewed the impact of COVID-19 in developing diverse neurologic manifestations associated with CNS, peripheral nervous system (PNS), skeletal muscle, and also pre-existing neurological diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, and myasthenia gravis. Furthermore, we discussed the involvement of key factors including age, sex, comorbidity, and disease severity in exacerbating the neurologic manifestations in COVID-19 patients. An outlook of present therapeutic strategies and state of existing challenges in COVID-19 management was also accessed. Conclusively, the present report provides a comprehensive review of COVID-19-related neurological complications and emphasizes the need for their early clinical management in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

We present a COVID-19 patient with refractory acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS), and life-threatening PE who underwent successful thrombolysis. CASE PRESENTATION: A previously healthy 47 year old male was admitted to our hospital due to severe COVID-19 pneumonia [confirmed by Real-Time-Polymerase-Chain-Reaction (RT-PCR)]. He had rapidly evolving ARDS [partial arterial pressure of oxygen to fractional inspired concentration of oxygen ratio: 175], and sepsis. Laboratory results showed lymphocytopenia, and increased D-dimer levels (7.7 μg/ml; normal: 0–0.5 μg/ml). The patient was treated in the intensive care unit. On day-1, ARDS-net/prone positioning ventilation, and empiric anti-COVID treatment integrating prophylactic anticoagulation was administered. On hospital day-2, the patient developed shock with worsening oxygenation. Point-of-care-ultrasound depicted a large thrombus migrating from the right atrium to the pulmonary circulation. Intravenous alteplase (100 mg over 2 h) was administered as rescue therapy. The patient made an uneventful recovery, and was discharged to home isolation (day-20) on oral rivaroxaban. CONCLUSION: Thrombolysis may have a critical therapeutic role for massive PE in COVID-19; however the risk of potential bleeding should not be underestimated.

The first proposed model is a Random Forest classifying descriptors of Action Unit (AU) time series; the second is a modified MobileNetV2 CNN classifying face images that combine three points in time; and the third is a custom deep network combining two CNN branches using the same input as for MobileNetV2 plus knowledge of the RFc. We conduct experiments with X-ITE phasic pain database, which comprises videotaped responses to heat and electrical pain stimuli, each of three intensities. Distinguishing these six stimulation types plus no stimulation was the main 7-class classification task for the human observers and automated approaches. Further, we conducted reduced 5-class and 3-class classification experiments, applied Multi-task learning, and a newly suggested sample weighting method. Experimental results show that the pain assessments of the human observers are significantly better than guessing and perform better than the automatic baseline approach (RFc-BL) by about 1%; however, the human performance is quite poor due to the challenge that pain that is ethically allowed to be induced in experimental studies often does not show up in facial reaction. We discovered that downweighting those samples during training improves the performance for all samples. The proposed RFc and two-CNNs models (using the proposed sample weighting) significantly outperformed the human observer by about 6% and 7%, respectively.","Othman, Ehsan; Werner, Philipp; Saxen, Frerk; Al-Hamadi, Ayoub; Gruss, Sascha; Walter, Steffen",Sensors (Basel),283,29

However, lack of access to UGS or important UGS features, in addition to concerns about UGS safety or maintenance, could prevent people from receiving these benefits. We designed an online survey to understand how people were using and perceiving UGS during the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City during the spring of 2020. The survey included questions about how people’s visits to UGS and perceptions of the importance of UGS for health had changed since the start of the pandemic, as well as the concerns people had and features of UGS they considered important. Of the 1372 people who took the survey, most respondents were concerned about a lack of social distancing and crowded UGS, and respondents with these concerns were less likely to visit UGS and had visited UGS less often during than before the pandemic. In addition, generalized linear models showed differences in some concerns and important features of UGS across gender, race and ethnicity, demonstrating the importance of considering community needs in UGS design and management. Although concerns about lack of access were not common in our study population, these also appeared to prevent people from using UGS, and were more common in certain areas of the city that were also hard-hit by COVID-19 in the beginning of the pandemic. To ensure that people can get health benefits from UGS during times of crisis, cities must eliminate barriers by providing equitable access to UGS, considering what amenities communities need from UGS, and provide consistent communication about public health policies.","Lopez, Bianca; Kennedy, Christopher; Field, Christopher; Mcphearson, Timon",Urban For Urban Green,283,30

Though medical applications remain the major area of application, biosensors are gradually penetrating a wide variety of non-medical areas. Earlier predictions indicated that the medical application was around 90% of the total biosensor market, which includes clinical applications for diabetes, cholesterol, and coagulation monitoring. However, medical applications of biosensors are now down to around 60%. These changes are atributed to the rapidly advancing technologies and to some serious business challenges. The biosensor field has expanded dramatically in the past 45 years or so since the first demonstration of a biosensor application in 1962. Self-diagnosis of blood glucose levels by diabetes sufferers, however, remains the dominant area of biosensor application. The increased investment in new laboratories is essential to permit the application research required for determining the commercial applicability of biosensors. Different trends and models for collaboration between different entities are being noticed at the present time. Some of these trends are presented here. Incubators are springing up wherein scholarly research at universities may be gradually turned into or groomed to becoming successful business ventures. In effect, the future expansion of biosensor markets will depend on the balance between market opportunities and technical and/or financial obstacles. Different examples of biosensor companies along with their product and what analyte it detects have been described. Most, if not all, of the examples have been selected at random to provide an overall perspective of the biosensors that have been or are in the process of being commercialized.","Sadana, Ajit; Sadana, Neeti",Fractal Analysis of the Binding and Dissociation Kinetics for Different Analytes on Biosensor Surfaces,283,20

Therefore, rapid and accurate identification of pathogenic viruses plays a vital role in selecting appropriate treatments, saving people’s lives and preventing epidemics. It is important to establish a quick standard diagnostic test for the detection of the infectious disease (COVID-19) to prevent subsequent secondary spread. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is regarded as a gold standard test for the molecular diagnosis of viral and bacterial infections with high sensitivity and specificity. Isothermal nucleic acid amplification is considered to be a highly promising candidate method due to its fundamental advantage in quick procedure time at constant temperature without thermocycler operation. A variety of improved or new approaches also have been developed. This review summarizes the currently available detection methods for coronavirus nucleic acid. It is anticipated that this will assist researchers and clinicians in developing better techniques for timely and effective detection of coronavirus infection.","Shen, Minzhe; Zhou, Ying; Ye, Jiawei; Abdullah AL-maskri, Abdu Ahmed; Kang, Yu; Zeng, Su; Cai, Sheng",J Pharm Anal,283,23

A biopsychosocial approach is critical for understanding the disproportionate death rate among men. Biological, psychological, behavioral, and social factors may put men at disproportionate risk of death. We propose a stepwise approach to clinical, public health, and policy interventions to reduce COVID-19–associated morbidity and mortality among men. We also review what health professionals and policy makers can do, and are doing, to address the unique COVID-19–associated needs of men.","Griffith, Derek M.; Sharma, Garima; Holliday, Christopher S.; Enyia, Okechuku K.; Valliere, Matthew; Semlow, Andrea R.; Stewart, Elizabeth C.; Blumenthal, Roger Scott",Prev Chronic Dis,283,22
