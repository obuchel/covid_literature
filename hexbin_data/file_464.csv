The spectrum of GBS includes acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP), acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN), acute motor sensory axonal neuropathy (AMSAN), and some other variants like Miller-Fisher syndrome (MFS). METHODS: Patient with AMAN variant of GBS after severe bilateral pneumonia and ARDS due to the novel pandemic H1N1 influenza A virus is presented. RESULTS: 28-year-old white female was admitted to our Intensive Care Unit during the influenza pandemic because of severe ARDS due to bilateral pneumonia. The course of the disease was complicated with the new onset tetraplegia due to the AMAN variant of GBS. Treatment with plasma exchange was conducted and the patient had satisfactory recovery. CONCLUSION: We report a case of AMAN variant of GBS associated with proven H1N1 influenza A infection. This virus has not been reported previously as the agent of antecedent infection that induced this disorder. Risk factors for other causes of ICU neuromuscular weakness are usually present in the ICU patients and should not be the reason for reluctance in active quest for GBS. Once the diagnosis of GBS is established or suspected the treatment with plasma exchange or intravenous immune globulin is indicated.","Kutleša, Marko; Santini, Marija; Krajinović, Vladimir; Raffanelli, Dinko; Baršić, Bruno",Neurocrit Care,464,22

Meningitis, encephalitis, and hepatic dysfunction have also been reported, particularly in severe cases with multisystem involvement. Scrub typhus has never been reported in the literature to cause urinary tract infections (UTIs) which includes cystitis and pyelonephritis. CASE PRESENTATION: A 45-year old male presenting to the outpatient unit with fever, right flank pain, and burning micturition for three days was initially treated for UTI. However, he returned to the hospital on the fourth day of illness with persistent symptoms. He was hospitalized, with intravenous (IV) ceftriaxone. Computerized tomography scan of his abdomen-pelvis showed features of acute pyelonephritis, so his antibiotics were upgraded to meropenem and teicoplanin. Despite this, the patient’s condition deteriorated. Laboratory investigations showed multisystem involvement: decreasing platelets, raised creatinine, and deranged liver panel. As Kathmandu was hit by dengue epidemic during the patient’s hospitalization, on the seventh day of his illness, blood samples were sent for tropical fever investigation. All tests came out negative except for scrub typhus—IgM antibodies positive on rapid diagnostic test. The patient’s symptoms subsided after 48 h of starting doxycycline and he became fully asymptomatic four days later. Fever did not recur even after discontinuing other IV antibiotics, favoring scrub typhus disease rather than systemic bacterial sepsis. CONCLUSIONS: Scrub typhus is an emerging infectious disease of Nepal. Therefore, every unexplained fever cases (irrespective of clinical presentation) should be evaluated for potential Rickettsiosis. Moreover, for cases with acute pyelonephritis, atypical causative agents should be investigated, for example scrub typhus in this case.","Bhattarai, Tulsi; Poudel, Sujan Chandra; Pokharel, Nishma; Bhattarai, Suraj",BMC Infect Dis,464,1

The Nuss procedure is a new effective treatment for severe flail chest patients who cannot be weaned from prolonged mechanical ventilation in the last few years. However, the procedure is not suitable when there are multiple fractures in both the anterior and lateral chest walls. Here, we reported a rare case of severe flail chest in a patient who suffered multiple fractures in both the anterior and lateral chest walls in a traffic accident. CASE PRESENTATION: A 49-year-old patient suffered severe flail chest by a steering wheel in a traffic accident with multiple fractures in both the anterior and lateral chest walls. In the beginning, the patient was administrated with mechanical ventilation because of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) for more than 1 week. Then the patient suffered from a severe lung infection and decreased blood oxygen saturation. After a multidiscipline discussion (MDT), three rib fixation plates were first used to rebuild the stability of lateral chest walls, then two Nuss bars were inserted to eliminate paradoxical movement in the anterior chest wall. Finally, the patient recovered smoothly after the combining procedure. CONCLUSIONS: Severe flail chest patients with both the anterior and lateral chest walls after trauma are in a life-threatening situation, and require an appropriate procedure to get out of danger in time. Rib fixation is an effective treatment when the fractured sites are few and the fractured area is small. The Nuss procedure is a new effective method for severe flail chest with multiple fractures in an anterior chest wall, which is also a minimally invasive and short time-consuming procedure. However, it does not suitable for the patient with multiple fractures in lateral chest walls. Combining the use of Nuss procedure and rib fixation can solve severe flail chest with multiple ribs and sternum fractures in both the anterior and lateral chest walls, and the outcome of this procedure is satisfying in the present rare case.","Guo, Quanwei; Zhang, Jinghui; Cai, Kaican; Zhang, Jianhua",BMC Surg,464,1

A study has suggested the efficacy of combination therapy with ART-123 and PMX-HP; however, it did not evaluate the effect modification between them. We hypothesised that coadministration of ART-123 and PMX-HP has a significant positive effect modification on survival outcome. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect modification between ART-123 and PMX-HP treatment on the survival outcome of sepsis using post hoc analysis of the dataset of the Japan Septic Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation registry. RESULTS: Of the 3195 patients recorded in the registry, 2350 were analysed. The product term between ART-123 and PMX-HP was analysed by the Cox regression model to evaluate significance. The primary outcome of this study was hospital mortality. Although the administration of ART-123 was independently positively associated with survival outcome (adjusted hazard ratio [HR]: 0.834, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.695–0.999; P = 0.049) in the model prior to the introduction of the product term, a significant effect modification on survival outcome was observed between the administration of ART-123 and PMX-HP treatment (adjusted HR: 0.667, 95% CI 0.462–0.961; P = 0.030). CONCLUSIONS: The main effect of the administration of ART-123 may be beneficial for survival outcome in patients with sepsis. In addition, a significant beneficial effect modification on survival outcome was observed between the administration of ART-123 and PMX-HP treatment.","Mochizuki, Katsunori; Mori, Kotaro; Kamijo, Hiroshi; Ichikawa, Michitaro; Nitta, Kenichi; Imamura, Hiroshi",Ann Intensive Care,464,21

These structures are deep and respond quickly, making them difficult to study during ongoing speech. Recent techniques have begun to address this problem, but yield temporally broad responses with consequently ambiguous neural origins. Here, we describe a method that pairs re-synthesized ‘peaky’ speech with deconvolution analysis of electroencephalography recordings. We show that in adults with normal hearing the method quickly yields robust responses whose component waves reflect activity from distinct subcortical structures spanning auditory nerve to rostral brainstem. We further demonstrate the versatility of peaky speech by simultaneously measuring bilateral and ear-specific responses across different frequency bands and discuss the important practical considerations such as talker choice. The peaky speech method holds promise as a tool for investigating speech encoding and processing, and for clinical applications.","Polonenko, Melissa J; Maddox, Ross K",,464,1
16041,16041,16041,Mitteilungen der DGG,10.881667,1.7453835,2021-03-10,"BACKGROUND: People living in rural and remote areas have poorer access to mental health services than those living in cities. They are also less likely to seek help because of self-stigma and entrenched stoic beliefs about help seeking as a sign of weakness. E-mental health services can span great distances to reach those in need and offer a degree of privacy and anonymity exceeding that of traditional face-to-face counseling and open up possibilities for identifying at-risk individuals for targeted intervention. OBJECTIVE: This scoping review maps the research that has explored text-based e-mental health counseling services and studies that have used language use patterns to predict mental health status. In doing so, one of the aims was to determine whether text-based counseling services have the potential to circumvent the barriers faced by clients in rural and remote communities using technology and whether text-based communications, in particular, can be used to identify individuals at risk of psychological distress or self-harm. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive electronic literature search of PsycINFO, PubMed, ERIC, and Web of Science databases for articles published in English through November 2020. RESULTS: Of the 9134 articles screened, 70 met the eligibility criteria and were included in the review. There is preliminary evidence to suggest that text-based, real-time communication with a qualified therapist is an effective form of e-mental health service delivery, particularly for individuals concerned with stigma and confidentiality. There is also converging evidence that text-based communications that have been analyzed using computational linguistic techniques can be used to accurately predict progress during treatment and identify individuals at risk of serious mental health conditions and suicide. CONCLUSIONS: This review reveals a clear need for intensified research into the extent to which text-based counseling (and predictive models using modern computational linguistics tools) may help deliver mental health treatments to underserved groups such as regional communities, identify at-risk individuals for targeted intervention, and predict progress during treatment. Such approaches have implications for policy development to improve intervention accessibility in at-risk and underserved populations.","Dwyer, Anne; de Almeida Neto, Abílio; Estival, Dominique; Li, Weicong; Lam-Cassettari, Christa; Antoniou, Mark",JMIR Ment Health,464,1

However, research mainly focused on sexual child abuse and knowledge is lacking on how individual program components contribute to the effectiveness of school-based prevention programs for any form of child abuse. This study aimed to examine the overall effect of these school-based programs on (a) children’s child abuse-related knowledge and (b) self-protection skills by conducting two three-level meta-analyses. Furthermore, moderator analyses were performed to identify how program components and delivery techniques were associated with effectiveness. A literature search yielded 34 studies (158 effect sizes; N = 11,798) examining knowledge of child abuse and 22 studies (99 effect sizes; N = 7804) examining self-protection skills. A significant overall effect was found of school-based programs on both knowledge (d = 0.572, 95% CI [0.408, 0.737], p < 0.001) and self-protection skills (d = 0.528, 95% CI [0.262, 0.794], p < 0.001). The results of the first meta-analysis on children’s child abuse knowledge suggest that program effects were larger in programs addressing social–emotional skills of children (d = 0.909 for programs with this component versus d = 0.489 for programs without this component) and self-blame (d = 0.776 versus d = 0.412), and when puppets (d = 1.096 versus d = 0.500) and games or quizzes (d = 0.966 versus d = 0.494) were used. The second meta-analysis on children’s self-protections skills revealed that no individual components or techniques were associated with increased effectiveness. Several other study and program characteristics did moderate the overall effects and are discussed. In general, school-based prevention programs show positive effects on both knowledge and self-protection skills, and the results imply that program effectiveness can be improved by implementing specific components and techniques.

The often asymptomatic status of C. trachomatis (CT) infections leads to an increased burden on human reproductive health, especially in middle- and low-income settings. Early detection and management of these infections could play a decisive role in controlling this public health burden. The objective of this review is to provide an insight into the evolution of diagnostic methods for CT infections through the development of new molecular technologies, emphasizing on -omics’ technologies and their significance as diagnostic tools both for effective patient management and control of disease transmission. METHODS: Narrative review of the diagnostic methodologies of CT infections and the impact of the introduction of -omics’ technologies on their diagnosis by review of the literature. RESULTS: Various methodologies are discussed with respect to working principles, required specifications, advantages, and disadvantages. Implementing the most accurate methods in diagnosis is highlighted as the cornerstone in managing CT infections. CONCLUSION: Diagnostics based on -omics’ technologies are considered to be the most pertinent modalities in CT testing when compared to other available methods. There is a need to modify these effective and accurate diagnostic tools in order to render them more available and feasible in all settings, especially aiming on turning them to rapid point-of-care tests for effective patient management and disease control.","Shetty, Seema; Kouskouti, Christina; Schoen, Uwe; Evangelatos, Nikolaos; Vishwanath, Shashidhar; Satyamoorthy, Kapaettu; Kainer, Franz; Brand, Angela",Braz J Microbiol,464,1

During surgery, in cases with advanced stage biliary tract tumors that cannot be performed hepatectomy, after aggressive dissections to provide a negative surgical margin, a large number of segmental bile ducts can be revealed and needs to ensure the continuity of bile flow. Here, our clinical series of portoenterostomy (PE) in which we applied in patients who had aggressive hilar dissection and resection for hilar cholangiocarcinomas and biliary tract tumors were discussed. The study included 15 patients who underwent PE for biliary tract tumors and hilar cholangiocarcinomas between 2015 and 2019.

Here, we show that emission reduction is the major driving force for the PM(2.5) change, contributing to a PM(2.5) decrease by 37% to 55% in the four YRD major cities (i.e., Shanghai, Hangzhou, Nanjing, and Hefei), but the MDA8 O(3) increase is driven by both emission reduction (29%–52%) and variation in meteorological conditions (17%– 49%). Among all pollutants, reduction in emissions mainly of primary PM contributes to a PM(2.5) decrease by 28% to 46%, and NOx emission reduction contributes 7% to 10%. Although NOx emission reduction dominates the MDA8 O(3) increase (38%–59%), volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emission reduction lead to a 5% to 9% MDA8 O(3) decrease. Increased O(3) promotes secondary aerosol formation and partially offsets the decrease of PM(2.5) caused by the primary PM emission reductions.

Fritschka,10.654261,1.6118624,2020-10-22,"The atmospheric concentration of well-mixed greenhouse gases has drastically increased since 1850. The prime cause for this increase is anthropogenic activity, particularly the burning of fossil fuels. As a consequence of the changing atmospheric composition, we observe a net positive radiative forcing, which manifests in global warming. The global mean surface temperature has increased since the preindustrial by about 1.0 °C. Under the assumption of continued greenhouse gas emissions, climate models project a temperature increase between 3.7 °C and 4.8 °C until 2100 (compared to the 1850-1900 mean). The assessment reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change detail the catastrophic consequences of global warming of such extent for both ecosystems and mankind. As a consequence, the Paris Agreement aims to limit global warming to below 2 °C, ideally 1.5 °C, when compared to the preindustrial. To achieve this goal, fast and ambitious emission controls are required, reaching net zero emission by 2050 at the latest. Examining the global greenhouse gas emissions of recent decades, it becomes obvious how far away we are at present from reaching this goal. Also, the currently determined national contributions for emission reduction do not suffice to meet the 1.5 °C target. Thus, it is of uttermost importance to raise the global ambition in climate protection. The 1.5 °C target can still be reached, however, the time to set the required measures will expire within this decade.","Rieder, Harald E.",Elektrotech,464,12

Recent conflict escalation between China and western countries gives rise to widespread concern over the possibility of delinking China from global trade and supply chain. By drawing on utility theory, we suggest that the political relationship is a key determinant of collective emotions of consumers and trading companies and consequently the interactions between importers and exporters. We hypothesize that warmer relations lead to larger increases (or smaller decreases) in trade while cooler relations have the opposite effect. Based on monthly data of China and her twelve trading partners from 1981 to 2019, our study provides an empirical investigation into the association between political relationship and bilateral trade flows. Our results show that shocks to relations are highly persistent and frequently cause changes in trade. However, relations themselves are little influenced by changes in trade, changes that show little persistence. We also address the US-China trade war and the observation that innovations to China’s exports to the US improve China’s relations with the US while shocks to American exports to China worsen relations from China’s perspective.","Whitten, Gregory; Dai, Xiaoyi; Fan, Simon; Pang, Yu",J,464,1

Intercultural models such as traditional, complementary and integrative medicine (TCIM) are an important part of health care in most countries and often contribute to expanding access to primary health care. Despite legal recognition and policies to integrate TCIM into health systems, their contribution to health, well-being, and people-centered care to achieve universal health is still underestimated. This article presents the progress (2017-2020) achieved by the Virtual Health Library specialized in the TCIM (VHL TCIM Americas), an initiative created as a tool to reduce the gaps in the production and access to validated information on TCIM. Through collaborative network work, the VHL TCIM Americas contributes to the democratization of health, access to verified scientific data, visibility of non-conventional knowledge, strengthening of research capacities, and exchange of experiences for informed decision-making.","Gallego-Pérez, Daniel F; Abdala, Carmen Verônica Mendes; Amado, Daniel Miele; Carvalho de Sousa, Islândia Maria; Aldana-Martínez, Natalia Sofía; Ghelman, Ricardo",Rev Panam Salud Publica,464,16

However, side effects with fatal risks, dysfunction in tumor microenvironment and low immune response rates remain the bottlenecks in immunotherapy. Nano metal-organic frameworks (nMOFs), with an accurate structure and a narrow size distribution, are emerging as a solution to these problems. In addition to their function of temporospatial delivery, a large library of their compositions, together with flexibility in chemical interaction and inherent immune efficacy, offers opportunities for various designs of nMOFs for immunotherapy. In this review, we overview state-of-the-art research on nMOFs-based immunotherapies as well as their combination with other therapies. We demonstrate that nMOFs are predominantly customized for vaccine delivery or tumor-microenvironment modulation. Finally, a prospect of nMOFs in cancer immunotherapy will be discussed.

The virus is called SARS-CoV-2, and the virus-induced disease is called COVID-19. The infection spreads via droplets or direct contact with contaminated surfaces. Airborne transmission occurs during aerosol-generating procedures on patients. Many otologic procedures are considered AGPs and therefore require precautions to protect staff and patients and minimize transmission of the disease. MAIN BODY: Outpatient otology activity has seen changes, including virtual clinics and limitation of face-to-face consultations, to ensure safety. Powered instrumentation should be avoided during surgical procedures unless necessary or replaced with other tools, and if performed, enhanced personal protective equipment (PPE) must be used. Ear, nose, and throat (ENT) examination is recommended for any patient with full PPE in place except for consultations done without examination. Systemic steroid administration for treating conditions such as Bell’s palsy and sudden sensorineural hearing loss should be discussed with both the patient and infectious diseases specialist to weigh risks against benefits. Triaging of patients and prioritization is unavoidable during the pandemic and even after due to the limitations of clinic and theater time. All emergency/urgent cases are considered potentially COVID-19 positive. For the semi-urgent and all elective cases, COVID-19 testing 48 h prior to surgery, strict quarantine awaiting test results, and repeat testing on day of surgery if rapid tests are available are the precautions suggested. Different measures should be in place to minimize staff potential exposure intraoperatively. CONCLUSIONS: Otology practice has been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Various measures are in place to ensure the delivery of safe and effective service for patients and health care workers.","Dawoud, Moustafa M.",Egypt J Otolaryngol,464,1

METHODS: This retrospective cohort study surveyed US‐based Humana claims, which includes prescription and patient records from private‐payer and Medicare insurance. Claims from 288,515 patients, aged 45 years and older, without prior history of NDD or neurological surgery, were surveyed for a diagnosis of NDD starting 1 year following statin exposure. Patients were required to be enrolled with claims data for at least 6 months prior to first statin prescription and at least 3 years thereafter. Computational system biology analysis was conducted to determine unique target engagement for each statin. RESULTS: Of the 288,515 participants included in the study, 144,214 patients (mean [standard deviation (SD)] age, 67.22 [3.8] years) exposed to statin therapies, and 144,301 patients (65.97 [3.2] years) were not treated with statins. The mean (SD) follow‐up time was 5.1 (2.3) years. Exposure to statins was associated with a lower incidence of Alzheimer's disease (1.10% vs 2.37%; relative risk [RR], 0.4643; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.44–0.49; P < .001), dementia 3.03% vs 5.39%; RR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.54–0.58; P < .001), multiple sclerosis (0.08% vs 0.15%; RR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.41–0.66; P < .001), Parkinson's disease (0.48% vs 0.92%; RR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.48–0.58; P < .001), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (0.02% vs 0.05%; RR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.30–0.69; P < .001). All NDD incidence for all statins, except for fluvastatin (RR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.65‐1.30; P = 0.71), was reduced with variances in individual risk profiles. Pathway analysis indicated unique and common profiles associated with risk reduction efficacy. DISCUSSION: Benefits and risks of statins relative to neurological outcomes should be considered when prescribed for at‐risk NDD populations. Common statin activated pathways indicate overarching systems required for risk reduction whereas unique targets could advance a precision medicine approach to prevent neurodegenerative diseases.","Torrandell‐Haro, Georgina; Branigan, Gregory L.; Vitali, Francesca; Geifman, Nophar; Zissimopoulos, Julie M.; Brinton, Roberta Diaz",Alzheimers Dement (N Y),464,13

We conducted a systematic review to establish if patients with GCS ≤ 8 for trauma or non-traumatic emergencies and treated in the acute care setting (e.g., Emergency Department or Pre-hospital environment) should be intubated to avoid aspiration or aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis, and consequently, reduce mortality. METHODS: We searched six databases, Pubmed, Embase, Scopus, SpringerLink, Cochrane Library, and Ovid Emcare, from April 15th to October 14th, 2020, for studies involving low GCS score patients of whom the risk of aspiration and related complications was assessed. RESULTS: Thirteen studies were included in the final analysis (7 on non-traumatic population, 4 on trauma population, 1 pediatric and 1 adult mixed case studies). For the non-traumatic cases, two prospective studies and one retrospective study found no difference in aspiration risk between intubated and non-intubated patients. Two retrospective studies reported a reduction in the risk of aspiration in the intubated patient group. For traumatic cases, the study that considered the risk of aspiration did not show any differences between the two groups. A study on adult mixed cases found no difference in the incidence of aspiration among intubated and non-intubated patients. A study on pediatric patients found increased mortality for intubated versus non-intubated non-traumatic patients with a low GCS score. CONCLUSION: Whether intubation results in a reduction in the incidence of aspiration events and whether these are more frequent in patients with low GCS scores are not yet established. The paucity of evidence on this topic makes clinical trials justifiable and necessary. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Prospero registration number: CRD42020136987.

And which ideas about the future stem from these events? The COVID-19 pandemic offers the opportunity to reflect on human actions occurring with a dimension of solidarity only in situations of emergency. We will start from Sorokin’s intuition, which can be summarized in the statement:The future of humanity is in the hands of humanity itself. We will assume that collective damage requires collective strategies, reinforcing and renovating networks in the community. To highlight the necessary changes to turn individual and collective dynamics towards resilience, we follow with the consideration that it is necessary to rediscover the positive values of individuals. This, in turn, leads to further reflection on the problems of choice and the ethics of responsibility that permits individuals to embrace the concept of “common good”, something that they experience as members of a community and that they can only pursue from the standpoint of solidarity.

The present study revealed that 21.2% of the respondents were experiencing severe anxiety, 34.8% moderately severe anxiety, 25.2% moderate anxiety, and 18.8% mild anxiety. Women have more rates of severe anxiety. People who get online knowledge about COVID19 have least rates of severe anxiety. 51.8% think having the virus is stigmatizing. Knowledge and stigma are insignificantly inversely correlated to anxiety scores CONCLUSION: Online scientific health education is necessary to reduce anxiety.","Rabei, Samah Hamed; El Fatah, Wafaa Osman Abd",Middle East Curr Psychiatry,464,1

Vested interests have been very persuasive in their propaganda against systems in other nations. Public policy has never truly addressed the issue of what should be the nature of the relationship between health services within a profit-based economy: What is the proper role for profit-oriented firms in the supply, provider functions, and insurance segment? How should their roles be assessed and at what costs and control are they permitted? What safeguards should be instituted to preserve a more appropriate and popularly desired balance? What is the necessary regulatory oversight for maintaining accountability? More importantly, is the structure and control over what we have now the best and the only way to organize healthcare services for the benefit of the American people and for their health promotion and well-being in the whole population?

AIMS: To present a polycarbonate box (EndoBox) designed for use in upper GI endoscopy and evaluate its impact on the contamination of endoscopy staff during simulated procedures. METHODS: Simulated gastroscopies were performed using an upper body simulator placed in left lateral decubitus (LLD) and supine positions. The endoscopist and assistant wore personal protective equipment. Droplet exposure was measured using fluorescent abiotic surrogate particles. Two blinded observers independently viewed images from each scenario to qualitatively evaluate contamination levels. The primary outcome was the level of HCW contamination by droplets generated from a simulated cough with and without the EndoBox on the upper body simulator. The endoscopist’s ergonomic behaviour was also assessed using the Rapid Upper Limb Assessment (RULA) tool. RESULTS: Without the EndoBox, there was a higher level of contamination on the endoscopist when the upper body simulator is in the LLD position. A higher level of contamination was observed on the assistant when the simulator is in supine position. With the EndoBox, the contamination levels on the endoscopy staff were lower in both LLD and supine scenarios. The endoscopist’s ergonomics were rated 2 to 3 on the RULA tool when using the EndoBox. CONCLUSIONS: The EndoBox reduces macroscopic droplet contamination during simulated gastroscopy. The endoscopist’s risk of musculoskeletal injury remained in the low risk categories as assessed by the RULA tool. Another advantage of the EndoBox design is the arch extending from the bottom that allows for removal of the box without withdrawing the endoscope. This enables rapid access to the patient’s airway if they experience respiratory distress. This study was limited by an inability to assess microscopic contamination and contamination at the level of the port or buttons when suction is applied. Within these limitations, the EndoBox may be a useful adjunct to traditional personal protective equipment.

The pandemic has also undone progress on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), widened income inequalities, and created a new backlash against digital globalization such that the UN social imperative – the pledge to leave no one behind by achieving the SDGs by 2030 – now appears an impossible task. Could the “going digital” MNEs that are making substantial investments in 4IR technologies take a socially proactive stance and thereby provide a window of opportunity that would rebuild momentum on the UN social imperative? Our paper explores the possible social impacts of MNE digitalization initiatives, both directly through their corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities and indirectly through their global value and supply chains. Because digitalization can be used for the good but requires adequate harnessing, we argue that three changes are needed to ensure that the going digitals, with the assistance of UN agencies, can simultaneously address their economic imperative and facilitate progress on the UN’s social imperative: (i) revamping the CSR function; (ii) making SDGs “matter”; and (iii) building a new UN–MNE coalition.","Srinivasan, Niraja; Eden, Lorraine",J Int Bus Policy,464,1

This is due to reductions in elective operating, clinic cancellations and redeployment of doctors to medical wards. Surgical education has evolved to address anxieties from staff about missing out on valuable skills and experience. Although there has been a big emphasis on virtual learning, in-person simulation remains highly relevant. The Double 2s MDT Surgical Emergencies Course was piloted amidst the pandemic at UHBW Foundation Trust. Places were restricted in view of social distancing (n = 13). Foundation doctors and nurses engaged in two simulation sessions based around acutely deteriorating surgical patients. Feedback was collected anonymously via an online google form. All participants agreed that the course was pertinent to their clinical practice. 77 and 100% learners felt that their confidence had improved in assessing and managing surgical emergencies respectively. The feedback shows that simulation can and should be employed alongside virtual learning to maintain the integrity of surgical education. Whilst the situation may eventually return to ‘business as normal’, the Double 2s course is appropriate to run again during winter pressures which may have similar implications for surgical training.

The cost of top-dressing agents is accounted for 20% of the production cost and therefore, the development of top-dressing automation technology is important to maintain and improve the financial and environmental viability of shrimp sustainable farming. This perspective described several sensor-based aquaculture technologies for on-farm management systems but sustainability in the aquaculture industry is not yet achieved in practice. The present technology is a new invention to reduce labor and production costs required for reducing bacterial and organic loads in Biofloc shrimp cultures. Aquaculture automation system disperses the top-dressing agents to the shrimp ponds based on the signals received from microbial and environmental sensors.

Though research on circular business models has recently increased, few scholars have investigated how companies engaged with CE view the connection between CE and sustainability. To address this gap, this paper uses a semi-quantitative survey and semi-structured interviews conducted with companies based in Italy and the Netherlands. Purposive sampling was employed to target firms associated with national and international CE networks, as these companies already engage with CE practices. The survey was distributed online to over 800 firms, of which 155 provided information on their understanding of the CE concept and its relationship with sustainability. The survey results are complemented through findings from 43 interviews with a subset of the survey respondents. The survey answers show that companies view CE as one of the tools to achieve sustainable development, particularly in the environmental domain, where the focus lies on environmentally friendly resource use. Yet, the respondents are less confident whether CE increases economic and social benefits of firms. Interviews show that a majority of respondents position sustainability as the overarching concept. However, most companies advocate that the private sector should strive for both sustainability and circularity, though the distinction between the two concepts in daily business operations seems synthetic and futile to some. These findings provide an important stepping stone for better understanding how firms could apply CE practices to move towards a more sustainable society.","Walker, Anna M.; Opferkuch, Katelin; Roos Lindgreen, Erik; Raggi, Andrea; Simboli, Alberto; Vermeulen, Walter J.V.; Caeiro, Sandra; Salomone, Roberta",Circ.Econ.Sust.,464,1

Whilst current evidence indicates the therapeutic benefits from the use of chemotherapy, self-perceived cognitive difficulties emerged as a frequent occurrence during and after chemotherapy treatment in breast cancer patients. AIM: The current study sought to investigate self-perceived cognitive impairment in a group of breast cancer patients in semi-rural South Africa. SETTING: The patients were recruited from an outpatient oncology clinic at a semi-rural, tertiary academic hospital in Gauteng, South Africa. METHODS: In a randomised, quantitative, time-based series study, 30 female patients aged 21–60 years (mean age = 50 years) diagnosed with stages II and III breast cancer on CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, fluorouracil) (n = 10) and FAC (fluorouracil, adriamycin, cyclophosphamide) (n = 20) chemotherapy regimens, completed the self-reported Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Cognition (Fact-Cog) test as a measure of subjective cognitive functioning at three points during the course of treatment (T(0), T(1), T(2)).

METHODS: We evaluated travel-related illness encountered at EuroTravNet clinics, the European surveillance sub-network of GeoSentinel, between March 1, 1998 and March 31, 2018. FINDINGS: 103,739 ill travellers were evaluated, including 11,239 (10.8%) migrants, 89,620 (86.4%) patients seen post-travel, and 2,880 (2.8%) during and after travel. Despite increasing numbers of patient encounters over 20 years, the regions of exposure by year of clinic visits have remained stable. In 5-year increments, greater proportions of patients were migrants or visiting friends and relatives (VFR); business travel-associated illness remained stable; tourism-related illness decreased. Falciparum malaria was amongst the most-frequently diagnosed illnesses with 5,254 cases (5.1% of all patients) and the most-frequent cause of death (risk ratio versus all other illnesses 2.5:1). Animal exposures requiring rabies post-exposure prophylaxis increased from 0.7% (1998–2002) to 3.6% (2013–2018). The proportion of patients with seasonal influenza increased from zero in 1998–2002 to 0.9% in 2013–2018. There were 44 cases of viral haemorrhagic fever, most during the past five years. Arboviral infection numbers increased significantly as did the range of presenting arboviral diseases, dengue and chikungunya diagnoses increased by 2.6% and 1%, respectively.

RECENT FINDINGS The number and proportion of older adults with schizophrenia is rapidly increasing. Schizophrenia is a heterogeneous disorder and older adults with schizophrenia display significant variability in symptom severity, quality of life and overall outcomes. Many achieve stable disease remission, some display persistent nonremission and others experience fluctuating symptoms. Depression is commonly reported, and although rates of suicide are higher when compared with age-matched peers, the excess mortality seen in this population is mainly attributed to natural causes of death. Cognitive decline and reduced illness awareness have important implications for functional status and quality of life. Antipsychotics remain essential in the treatment regimen, although elderly patients with chronic disease may be good candidates for gradual dose reduction. Interdisciplinary treatment approaches as well as nonpharmacologic psychosocial interventions play a critical adjunctive role in the treatment of older adults with schizophrenia. SUMMARY Research focusing on schizophrenia in late life is sparse. Too often, older patients are eliminated from research studies or averaged in with all age groups. Thus, there continues to be gaps in our understanding of modifiable predictors of remission and recovery, and the most efficacious and safest treatment approaches for this age group.","Solomon, Haley V; Sinopoli, Martina; DeLisi, Lynn E",Current opinion in psychiatry,464,17

Unique to this study is a multivariate approach that has yet to be fully explored by previous research. Using an interconnected multifactor model, this work investigated social determinant, geographic, prior health, and political behavioral factors likely to influence Covid-19 per capita fatalities in Texas. Methods: County-level income, rurality, insurance, health status, 2020 presidential vote percentage, and fatality rate data were collected and analyzed in a path analysis model with Covid-19 per capita fatalities as the key variable of interest. Results: The analysis found strong support for the proposed model structure (R2 = 37.6%). The strongest overall effects on the Covid-19 per capita fatality rate came from income levels and voting behaviors. Conclusion: The model explained a substantial amount of variability in mortalities attributed to Covid-19. Socioeconomic and political factors provided the strongest contribution to the per-capita Covid-19 death rate, controlling for the other variables studied. The Covid-19 pandemic was highly politicized by various leaders and media outlets. The current analysis showed that political trends were one of the key overall factors related to Covid-19 mortality. The strongest overall factor was median income. Income is used to enhance one's current health or acquire adequate treatment which may safeguard people from the most severe effects of Covid-19. Counties with lower income levels had higher rates of Covid-19 per capita fatalities.","Penuliar, M. S.; Clark, C.; Curti, D.; Carrasco, M.; Hudson, C.; Philips, B.",,464,1

The pandemic generated by COVID-19 has increased these waiting lists. In this study two objectives were pursued: on the one hand, to determine which are the resources that are determining the number of persons that are in a surgery waiting list per 1,000 inhabitants; on the other hand, to estimate the impact that the current pandemic has on the latter. METHODS To estimate which are the resources that are having a greater impact on the waiting lists and to forecast the effect that the COVID-19 has on them, we use dynamic panel data models. The data on the surgery resources and on the waiting lists by autonomous communities is obtained from the Surveys on Health, Hospital Statistics and reports on waiting lists of the Ministry of Health, Consumption and Social Well Being and the Counsels. The sample period is 2012-2017 (last published year for surgery resources). In addition, a literature review is conducted and it shows the important and complexity of waiting list like a gestion tool of health system (Science, SciELO and Dialnet web data bases). RESULTS COVID-19 will increase the waiting lists by approximately 7.6% to 19.14%, depending on the autonomous community. Not all the available surgery resources have the same relevance nor an equal effect on the reduction of the waiting lists. The most significant resources are the beds and operating rooms per 1,000 inhabitants. The hospital expenditure is not so relevant. CONCLUSIONS The panel data models estimate the relation between the surgery resources and the waiting list. The latter is deemed complex and different across autonomous communities. In addition, these models allow to predict the expected increase in the waiting lists and are, thus, a useful instrument for their management.","De Pablos Escobar, Laura; García-Centeno, María-Carmen",Revista espanola de salud publica,464,12

The patient, who had only mild illness without fever or cough and was not wearing a mask, drove the car for 15 minutes with the air conditioning turned on and windows closed. The PCIS was clipped to the sun-visor above the front passenger seat and was retrieved from the car two hours after completion of the drive. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 was detectable at all PCIS stages by PCR and was cultured from the section of the sampler collecting particles in the 0.25 to 0.50 µm size range. CONCLUSIONS: Our data highlight the potential risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission by minimally symptomatic persons in the closed space inside of a car and suggest that a substantial component of that risk is via aerosolized virus.","Lednicky, John A; Lauzardo, Michael; Alam, Md M; Elbadry, Maha A; Stephenson, Caroline J; Gibson, Julia C; Morris, J Glenn",Int. j. infect. dis,464,21

Our model incorporates two important dynamically varying population behaviors: level of caution and sense of safety. Level of caution increases with infectious cases, while an increasing sense of safety with increased vaccination lowers precautions. Our model accurately reproduces the complete time history of COVID-19 infections for various regions of the United States. We propose a parameter [Formula: see text] as a direct measure of a population's caution against an infectious disease that can be obtained from the infectious cases. The model provides quantitative measures of highest disease transmission rate, effective transmission rate, and cautionary behavior. We predict future COVID-19 trends in the United States accounting for vaccine rollout and behavior. Although a high rate of vaccination is critical to quickly ending the pandemic, a return towards pre-pandemic social behavior due to increased sense of safety during vaccine deployment can cause an alarming surge in infections. Our results predict that at the current rate of vaccination, the new infection cases for COVID-19 in the United States will approach zero by August 2021.

One mechanism of aging is the progressive shortening of telomeres, which are protective structures at chromosome ends. Critically short telomeres impair the regenerative capacity of tissues and trigger loss of tissue homeostasis and disease. The SARS-CoV-2 virus infects many different cell types, forcing cell turn-over and regeneration to maintain tissue homeostasis. We hypothesize that presence of short telomeres in older patients limits the tissue response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We measure telomere length in peripheral blood lymphocytes COVID-19 patients with ages between 29 and 85 years-old. We find that shorter telomeres are associated to increased severity of the disease. Individuals within the lower percentiles of telomere length and higher percentiles of short telomeres have higher risk of developing severe COVID-19 pathologies.","Sanchez-Vazquez, Raul; Guío-Carrión, Ana; Zapatero-Gaviria, Antonio; Martínez, Paula; Blasco, Maria A",Aging (Albany NY),464,2

In a subgroup analysis of the PRACTICAL study, a pragmatic randomised controlled trial of budesonide-formoterol reliever therapy versus maintenance budesonide plus terbutaline reliever therapy in adults with mild asthma, we recently reported that about two-thirds preferred as-needed combination preventer and reliever therapy. The aim of this study was to determine the relative importance of attributes associated with these two asthma therapies in this subgroup of participants who indicated their preferred treatment in the PRACTICAL study. METHODS: At their final study visit, a subgroup of participants indicated their preferred treatment and completed a discrete choice experiment using the Potentially All Pairwise RanKings of all possible Alternatives method and 1000minds software. Treatment attributes and their levels were selected from measurable study outcomes, and included: treatment regimen, shortness of breath, steroid dose and likelihood of asthma flare-up. RESULTS: The final analysis dataset included 288 participants, 64% of whom preferred as-needed combination preventer and reliever. Of the attributes, no shortness of breath and lowest risk of asthma flare-up were ranked highest and second highest, respectively. However, the relative importance of the other two attributes varied by preferred therapy: treatment regimen was ranked higher by participants who preferred as-needed treatment than by participants who preferred maintenance treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge of patient preferences for treatment attributes together with regimen characteristics can be used in shared decision-making regarding choice of treatment for patients with mild-moderate asthma.

These measures, which include isolation, stringent border controls, physical distancing and improved hygiene also have effects on other human pathogens, including parasitic enteric diseases such as cryptosporidiosis. Cryptosporidium infections in humans are almost entirely caused by two species: C. hominis, which is primarily transmitted from human to human, and Cryptosporidium parvum, which is mainly zoonotic. By monitoring Cryptosporidium species and subtype families in human cases of cryptosporidiosis before and after the introduction of Covid-19 control measures in New Zealand, we found C. hominis was completely absent after the first months of 2020 and has remained so until the beginning of 2021. Nevertheless, C. parvum has followed its typical transmission pattern and continues to be widely reported. We conclude that ~7 weeks of isolation during level 3 and 4 lockdown period interrupted the human to human transmission of C. hominis leaving only the primarily zoonotic transmission pathway used by C. parvum. Secondary anthroponotic transmission of C. parvum remains possible among close contacts of zoonotic cases. Ongoing 14-day quarantine measures for new arrivals to New Zealand have likely suppressed new incursions of C. hominis from overseas. Our findings suggest that C. hominis may be controlled or even eradicated through nonpharmaceutical interventions.","Knox, M A; Garcia-R, J C; Ogbuigwe, P; Pita, A; Velathanthiri, N; Hayman, D T S",Parasitology,464,10

To meet diagnostic needs as the pandemic grows, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently granted several commercial SARS-CoV-2 tests Emergency Use Authorization (EUA), but manufacturer-independent evaluation data are scarce. We performed the first manufacturer-independent evaluation of the fully automated sample-to-result two-target test cobas 6800 SARS-CoV-2 (cobas) (Roche Molecular Systems, Branchburg, NJ), which received U.S. FDA EUA on 12 March 2020.

Immediate prospective head-to-head comparative evaluation followed on 502 samples, and the diagnostic approaches showed overall agreement of 99.6% and a kappa value of 0.98. A good correlation (r 2 = 0.96) between cycle threshold values for SARS-CoV-2-specific targets obtained by cobas and the comparator was observed. Our results showed that cobas is a reliable assay for qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swab samples collected in the Universal Transport Medium System (UTM-RT) (Copan, Brescia, Italy).

Here, we employed an integrated computational approach involving structure and sequence based predictions to study the effect of naturally occurring variations in the S-RBD on its stability and ACE2 binding affinity. The hotspot stabilizing residue mutations N501I, N501Y, Q493L, Q493H and K417R, strengthen the RBD-ACE2 complex by modulating the interaction statistics at the interface. Thus, we report here some critical mutations that could increase the binding affinity of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD with ACE2, increasing the viral infectivity and pathogenicity. Understanding the effect of these mutations will help in developing potential vaccines and therapeutics.","Verma, Jyoti; Subbarao, Naidu",Virology,464,16

Groups of ten golden Syrian hamsters were infected intranasally with SARS-CoV-2 or phosphate-buffered saline (mock infection). Necropsies were performed at 1, 3, 6, and 14 days post-infection (dpi). Lung samples were investigated using hematoxylin and eosin, alcian blue, immunohistochemistry targeting aquaporin 1, CD3, CD204, CD31, laminin, myeloperoxidase, SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein, and transmission electron microscopy. SARS-CoV-2 infected animals showed endothelial hypertrophy, endothelialitis, and vasculitis. Inflammation mainly consisted of macrophages and lower numbers of T-lymphocytes and neutrophils/heterophils infiltrating the vascular walls as well as the perivascular region at 3 and 6 dpi. Affected vessels showed edema formation in association with loss of aquaporin 1 on endothelial cells. In addition, an ultrastructural investigation revealed disruption of the endothelium. Summarized, the presented findings indicate that loss of aquaporin 1 entails the loss of intercellular junctions resulting in paracellular leakage of edema as a key pathogenic mechanism in SARS-CoV-2 triggered pulmonary lesions.","Allnoch, L.; Beythien, G.; Leitzen, E.; Becker, K.; Kaup, F.

However, data on the development of humoral immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in patients with kidney disease is limited, and the utility of an LFIA to test for antibodies in these patients has not been assessed. Study Design: Observational study. Setting & Participants: 60 patients (40 hemodialysis and 20 kidney transplant recipients) with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by viral reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing and 88 historic negative-control samples (collected before September 2019). Test: A commercially available LFIA to test for SARS-CoV-2 IgG in patients with infection confirmed by viral RT-PCR testing. Outcomes: Sensitivity and specificity of the LFIA to detect SARS-CoV-2 IgG in dialysis patients and transplant recipients. Results: 56/58 (96.6%) patients (38/39 hemodialysis and 18/19 transplant recipients) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG. 5/7 (71.4%) patients who were negative on preliminary testing had detectable IgG when retested more than 21 days postdiagnosis. Median times to first and second tests after diagnosis were 17 (interquartile range, 15-20) and 35 (interquartile range, 30-39) days, respectively. Calculation of test characteristics gave sensitivity of 96.6% (95% CI, 88.3%-99.4%) and specificity of 97.7% (95% CI, 92.0-99.6%). Limitations: Possible exposure to other beta-coronaviruses that may cross-react with the antigen used in the LFIA cannot be excluded. Conclusions: Symptomatic dialysis patients and transplant recipients commonly develop an immune response against SARS-CoV-2 infection that can be detected using an LFIA. Used diligently, an LFIA could be used to help screen the dialysis populations or confirm exposure on a patient level, especially in facilities in which laboratory resources are limited.","Prendecki, Maria; Clarke, Candice; McKinnon, Tom; Lightstone, Liz; Pickering, Matthew C; Thomas, David C; McAdoo, Stephen P; Willicombe, Michelle",,464,3

No statistical method exists for estimating SBM diffusion coefficients from a given timetree and tip coordinates, and no method exists for simulating SBM along a given timetree.

The government has introduced budget cuts, reducing spending during this pandemic, and failed to provide adequate measures to protect already vulnerable citizens living in poverty and within the grips of the drug war, from COVID-19. Frontline workers are labouring in unsafe conditions with inadequate protective equipment and protocols. As a result, the death toll has risen rapidly. Mexico is currently listed as having the fourth highest death rate. I describe how fearing death, many have turned to the saint of death for recovery from coronavirus and to prolong life.

Women were recruited at cancer treatment facilities in Namibia, Nigeria, Uganda, and Zambia. The baseline interview included information used to generate the geospatial features: urban/rural residence, travel mode to treatment facility, and straight-line distances from home to first care provider and to diagnostic/treatment facility, categorized into country/ethnicity (population)-specific quartiles. These factors were investigated in relation to delay in diagnosis (&#8805;3 months since first symptom) and late stage at diagnosis (TNM: III, IV) using logistic regression, adjusted for population group and sociodemographic characteristics. The median (interquartile range) distances to first provider and diagnostic and treatment facilities were 5 (1-37), 17 (3-105), and 62 (5-289) kms, respectively. The majority had a delay in diagnosis (74%) and diagnosis at late stage (64%). Distance to first provider was not associated with delay in diagnosis or late stage at diagnosis. Rural residence was associated with delay, but the association did not persist after adjustment for sociodemographic characteristics. Distance to the diagnostic/treatment facility was associated with delay (highest vs lowest quartile: Odds Ratio (OR)=1.56, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.08-2.27) and late stage (overall: OR=1.47, CI=1.05-2.06; without Nigerian hospitals where mostly local residents were treated: OR=1.73, CI=1.18-2.54).

The nanodevice is built by combining an ultraviolet (UV) light-activatable aptamer module and a photosensitizer (PS) with up-conversion nanoparticle (UCNP) that enables the operation of the nanodevice with deep tissue-penetrable NIR light. The UCNPs can convert two distinct NIR excitations into orthogonal UV and green emissions for programmable photoactivation of the aptamer modules and PSs, respectively, allowing spatiotemporally controlled target recognition and photodynamic antitumor effect.

In the context of viral infection, a growing body of evidence shows that Î³Î´ T cells are particularly equipped for early virus detection, which triggers their subsequent activation, expansion and the fast deployment of antiviral functions such as direct cytotoxic pathways, secretion of cytokines, recruitment and activation of other immune cells and mobilization of a trained immunity memory program. As such, Î³Î´ T cells represent an attractive target to stimulate for a rapid and effective resolution of viral infections. Here, we review the known aspects of Î³Î´ T cells that make them crucial component of the immune response to viruses, and the ways that their antiviral potential can be harnessed to prevent or treat viral infection.","Caron, Jonathan; Ridgley, Laura Alice; Bodman-Smith, Mark",Front Immunol,464,29

Since the number of opioid overdoses is still increasing, it is becoming obvious that current rather unsystematic approaches to tackle this health problem are not effective. This review suggests that fighting the opioid epidemic requires a structured public health approach. Therefore, it is important to consider not only scientific and biomedical perspectives, but societal implications and the lived experience of groups at risk as well. Hence, this review evaluates the risk factors associated with opioid overdoses and investigates the rates of chronic opioid misuse, particularly in the context of chronic pain as well as post-surgery treatments, as the entrance of opioids in people's lives. Linking pharmaceutical biology to narrative analysis is essential to understand the modulations of the usual themes of addiction and abuse present in the opioid crisis. This paper shows that patient narratives can be an important resource in understanding the complexity of opioid abuse and addiction. In particular, the relationship between chronic pain and social inequality must be considered. The main goal of this review is to demonstrate how a deeper transdisciplinary-enriched understanding can lead to more precise strategies of prevention or treatment of opioid abuse.","Damiescu, Roxana; Banerjee, Mita; Lee, David Y W; Paul, Norbert W; Efferth, Thomas",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),464,1

The Motor Neuron Disease Systematic Multi-Arm Randomised Adaptive Trial (MND-SMART) is a multisite UK trial seeking to address the paucity in effective disease-modifying drugs for people with MND (pwMND). Historically, neurological trials have been plagued by suboptimal recruitment and high rates of attrition. Failure to recruit and/or retain participants can cause insufficiently representative samples, terminated trials or invalid conclusions. This study investigates patient-specific factors affecting recruitment and retention of pwMND to MND-SMART. Improved understanding of these factors may improve trial protocol design, optimise recruitment and retention. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: PwMND on the Scottish MND Register, Clinical Audit Research and Evaluation of MND (CARE-MND), will be invited to participate in a prospective observational cohort study that investigates factors affecting trial participation and attrition. We hypothesise that patient-specific factors will significantly affect trial recruitment and retention. Participants will complete the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, 9-Item Patient Health Questionnaire and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-Form Y to evaluate neuropsychiatric symptoms, the ALS-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire-Brief Form and Centre for Disease Control and Prevention-Health-Related Quality of Life for quality of life and a novel study-specific questionnaire on Attitudes towards Clinical Trial Participation (ACT-Q). Clinical data on phenotype, cognition (Edinburgh Cognitive and Behavioural ALS Screen) and physical functioning (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale-Revised) will also be collated. Caregivers will complete the Brief Dimensional Apathy Scale. After 12 months, a data request to MND-SMART will evaluate recruitment and retention. Descriptive statistics will summarise and compare assessments and participants reaching impairment thresholds. Variable groupings: attitudes, quality of life, cognition, behaviour, physical functioning, neuropsychiatric and phenotype. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression will explore association with participation/withdrawal in MND-SMART; presented as ORs and 95% CIs. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval was provided by the West of Scotland Research Ethics Committee 3 (20/WS/0067) on 12 May 2020. The results of this study will be published in a peer-reviewed journal, presented at academic conferences and disseminated to participants and the public.","Beswick, Emily; Glasmacher, Stella A; Dakin, Rachel; Newton, Judith; Carson, Alan; Abrahams, Sharon; Chandran, Siddharthan; Pal, Suvankar",BMJ Open,464,17

The American Academy of Sleep Medicine strongly urges sleep clinicians to continue postponing non-urgent care until a later date, if such a recommendation is made by state officials due to local conditions. At the same time, one cannot ignore the fact that sleep is important for people's health and wellbeing. Therefore, to protect the health of the population, it is essential to find ways and means to continue the practice of sleep medicine even during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: Social environment and work ethics in sleep clinics and sleep laboratories in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are different from those in the US. Under these circumstances, the Indian Society for Sleep Research (ISSR) created a task force to develop guidelines for the practice of sleep medicine, not only for the Indian environment but also for other countries that are affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The task force examined documents regarding practice of sleep medicine and associated specialities during COVID-19 by various professional organizations and governmental authorities. The recommendations were examined for their applicability. Wherever gaps were identified, consensus was reached keeping in view the available evidences. Outcome and Recommendations: The emphasis of the guidelines is on avoiding doctor to patient contact during the pandemic. Teleconsultation and other modes of audio-visuals can be used as modes for medical practice during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, in addition to the patient, the presence of a family member, or a reliable informant is recommended. Patients of most sleep disorders can be provided tele-aftercare service. ISSR guidelines also give a list of medications allowed to be prescribed during the first and the follow-up teleconsultation. Hospitals and clinics are slowly opening in India and many other countries. As sleep services resume operations, there is a need to find innovative ways to reduce contact with COVID-19 patients, follow personal protection guidelines, as well as social distancing. This article does discuss strategies for the safe conduct of Level 1 sleep studies. Home sleep testing, which had greater acceptance during the last few years, should be given more attention during the COVID-19 period. Once the decision to reopen the sleep laboratory and resume operations is made, the safety of the patients and office staff should become the major priority. The ISSR recommendation is to postpone and reschedule in-laboratory positive pressure therapy, but it mentions the considerations to be followed in emergency situations. At the same time, high clinical risk patients may be diagnosed on the basis of clinical findings, and without performing polysomnography or home sleep testing. However, at some point, there is a need to reinitiate the in-lab testing. In addition, daily assessment of the COVID-19 situation in the community, along with a review of the situation with local public health and the state health department is advised.","Gupta, Ravi; Kumar, V Mohan; Tripathi, Manjari; Datta, Karuna; Narayana, Manjunatha; Ranjan Sarmah, Kripesh; Bhatia, Manvir; Devnani, Preeti; Das, Sourav; Shrivastava, Deepak; Gourineni, Rama Devi; Singh, Tripat Deep; Jindal, Apar; Mallick, Hruda Nanda",Sleep Vigil,464,2

RECENT FINDINGS: The current literature does not support the risk of intraoperative viral transmission nor does it suggest a harm of minimally invasive procedures in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, medical societies mostly adopted a precautionary approach with a focus on protective measures. Austrian surgeons considered MIS safe during the pandemic and Austria managed to keep the initial outbreak in control. Yet, MIS programs were still affected due to the postponements of elective procedures and switches to other methods by some surgeons. SUMMARY: The postponement and cancellation of MIS caused complexities in health-care delivery in Austria, whilst the evidence to substantiate this precautionary approach is missing. It must be noted, both the guidelines and our review are limited by the scarcity of evidence. In further consequence, regional factors should be considered while taking precautions. Specific studies on the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 transmission risk during MIS are urgently needed.","Mun, Dong-Ho; Pradere, Benjamin; Shariat, Shahrokh F; Yurdakul, Ozan; Remzi, Mesut",Curr Opin Urol,464,24

We extend the discussion to Herpesviridae, Coronaviridae, and Toxoplasma, as well as to diverse bacteria and yeasts, and debate the advantages and disadvantages that endozoite infection might afford to the host and to the ecosystem. We provide a clinical perspective in which endozoites are implicated in neurodegenerative disease, anxiety/depression, and schizophrenia.

Thoracic aortic dissection typically presents with tearing chest, back, or abdominal pain. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a viral disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome–coronavirus 2 (SARS–Cov2), which has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) and usually manifests with respiratory symptoms, including cough, shortness of breath, flu-like symptoms, and fever. This case report highlights an important impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the identification and management of aortic dissection in the emergency department. Case report: A 35-year-old Bahraini male, a suspected case of Marfan syndrome, presented with complaints of shortness of breath and worsening productive cough after returning from the United States (U.S). He denied any chest, back, or abdominal pain, dizziness, weakness in any limb, gait disturbance, headache, or change in vision. He was considered high risk for COVID-19 because of the recent travel and respiratory symptoms and was diagnosed incidentally with ascending aortic dissection along with a right lung consolidation. His SARS–Cov2 PCR came negative thrice during hospital stay, and he underwent elective cardiothoracic surgery. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic has been a major stressor for the healthcare system worldwide, inflicting serious threats. Aortic dissection is one of the major life-threatening diseases that needs to be identified early on in the emergency department; however, in this case delayed diagnosis raised significant concerns due to underlying evolving triaging system for COVID-19 and atypical and overlapping clinical presentation. Further research is needed to look for COVID-19–associated factors, affecting the standard of care in the emergency department.

Internet-based behavioural activation (iBA) therapy has demonstrated its efficacy for improving postnatal depression. No study has examined whether the iBA program is also effective at preventing child abuse. This study aims to investigate whether iBA improves depressive symptoms among mothers and prevents abusive behaviours towards children in postpartum mothers in a randomized controlled trial, stratifying on depressive mood status. The study also evaluates the implementation aspects of the program, including how users, medical providers, and managers perceive the program in terms of acceptability, appropriateness, feasibility, and harm done. METHODS: The study is a non-blinded, stratified randomized controlled trial. Based on cut-off scores validated on Japanese mothers, participants will be stratified to either a low Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) group, (EPDS 0–8 points) or a high EPDS group (EPDS ≥9 points). A total of 390 postnatal women, 20 years or older, who have given birth within 10 weeks and have regular internet-access will be recruited at two hospitals. Participants will be randomly assigned to either treatment, with treatment as usual (TAU) or through intervention groups. The TAU group receives 12 weekly iBA sessions with online assignments and feedback from trained therapists. Co-primary outcomes are maternal depressive symptoms (EPDS) and psychological aggression toward children (Conflict Tactic Scale 1) at the 24-week follow-up survey. Secondary outcomes include maternal depressive symptoms, parental stress, bonding relationship, quality of life, maternal health care use, and paediatric outcomes such as physical development, preventive care attendance, and health care use. The study will also investigate the implementation outcomes of the program. DISCUSSION: The study investigates the effectiveness of the iBA program for maternal depressive symptoms and psychological aggression toward children, as well as implementation outcomes, in a randomized-controlled trial. The iBA may be a potential strategy for improving maternal postnatal depression and preventing child abuse. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study protocol (issue date: 2019-Mar-01, original version 2019005NI-00) was registered at the UMIN Clinical Trial Registry (UMIN-CTR: ID UMIN 000036864).","Obikane, Erika; Baba, Toshiaki; Shinozaki, Tomohiro; Obata, Soichiro; Nakanishi, Sayuri; Murata, Chie; Ushio, Emiko; Suzuki, Yukio; Shirakawa, Norihito; Honda, Mari; Sasaki, Natsu; Nishi, Daisuke; O’Mahen, Heather; Kawakami, Norito",BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth,464,20

The present study aimed to explore the views and behavior of HCWs and non-HCWs towards the phenomenon of working while experiencing ILI. METHODS: The study was a cross-sectional online survey conducted between October 2018 and January 2019 to explore sickness presenteeism and the behaviour of HCWs and non-HCWs when experiencing ILI. The survey questionnaire was distributed to the members and international networks of the International Society of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy (ISAC) Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) Working Group, as well as via social media platforms, including LinkedIn, Twitter and IPC Blog. RESULTS: In total, 533 respondents from 49 countries participated (Europe 69.2%, Asia-Pacific 19.1%, the Americas 10.9%, and Africa 0.8%) representing 249 HCWs (46.7%) and 284 non-HCWs (53.2%). Overall, 312 (58.5%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 56.2–64.6) would continue to work when sick with ILI, with no variation between the two categories. Sixty-seven (26.9%) HCWs and forty-six (16.2%) non-HCWs would work with fever alone (p<0 .01) Most HCWs (89.2–99.2%) and non-HCWs (80%-96.5%) would work with “minor” ILI symptoms, such as sore throat, sinus cold, fatigue, sneezing, runny nose, mild cough and reduced appetite. CONCLUSION: A future strategy to successfully prevent the transmission of ILI in healthcare settings should address sick-leave policy management, in addition to encouraging the uptake of influenza vaccine.","Tartari, Ermira; Saris, Katja; Kenters, Nikki; Marimuthu, Kalisvar; Widmer, Andreas; Collignon, Peter; Cheng, Vincent C.

In general, TLRs mediate these effects by utilizing different intracellular signaling molecules, one of them is Mal. Mal is a protein closely related to the antibacterial response, and its role in the TLR7 pathways remains poorly understood. In this study, we show that Mal determines the expression and secretion of IFNβ following activation of TLR7, a receptor that recognizes ssRNA and imidazoquinolines. Moreover, we observed that R848 induces Mal-dependent IFNβ production via ERK1/2 activation as well as the transcription factor IRF7 activation. Although activation of TLR7 leads to NF-κB-dependent expression of IRF7, this process is independent of Mal. We also demonstrate that secretion of IFNβ regulated by TLR7 and Mal in macrophages and dendritic cells leads to the IP-10 chemokine expression. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that Mal is a critical regulator of the imidazoquinolinones-dependent IFNβ production via ERK1/2/IRF7 signaling cascade which brings us closer to understanding the molecular mechanism’s regulation of innate immune response.","Leszczyńska, Ewa; Makuch, Edyta; Mitkiewicz, Małgorzata; Jasyk, Izabella; Narita, Miwako; Górska, Sabina; Lipiński, Tomasz; Siednienko, Jakub",Int J Mol Sci,464,20

Even as the epidemic appears to be near its end in the Americas, it is unclear whether substantial Zika virus transmission may still be ongoing. This issue is exacerbated by large discrepancies in local case reporting and significant delays in detecting outbreaks due to surveillance gaps. To uncover locations with lingering outbreaks in the Americas, we investigated travel-associated Zika cases diagnosed in the United States and Europe to identify signatures of transmission dynamics that were not captured by local reporting. We found that a large and unreported Zika outbreak occurred in Cuba during 2017, a year after peak transmission in neighboring countries, with cases still appearing in 2018. By sequencing Zika virus from infected travelers, we show that the 2017 outbreak in Cuba was sparked by long-lived lineages of Zika virus introduced from multiple places in the Americas a year prior. Our data suggest that while aggressive mosquito control in Cuba may initially have been effective at mitigating Zika virus transmission, in the absence of vaccines, herd immunity, or strong international coordination, such control measures may need to be maintained to be effective. Our study highlights how Zika virus may still be ‘silently’ spreading in the Americas and provides a framework for more accurately understanding outbreak dynamics.","Grubaugh, Nathan D.; Saraf, Sharada; Gangavarapu, Karthik; Watts, Alexander; Tan, Amanda L.; Oidtman, Rachel J.; Ladner, Jason T.; Oliveira, Glenn; Matteson, Nathaniel L.; Kraemer, Moritz U.G.; Vogels, Chantal B.F.; Hentoff, Aaron; Bhatia, Deepit; Stanek, Danielle; Scott, Blake; Landis, Vanessa; Stryker, Ian; Cone, Marshall R.; Kopp, Edgar W.; Cannons, Andrew C.; Heberlein-Larson, Lea; White, Stephen; Gillis, Leah D.; Ricciardi, Michael J.; Kwal, Jaclyn; Lichtenberger, Paola K.; Magnani, Diogo M.; Watkins, David I.; Palacios, Gustavo; Hamer, Davidson H.; Gardner, Lauren M.; Alex Perkins, T.; Baele, Guy; Khan, Kamran; Morrison, Andrea; Isern, Sharon; Michael, Scott F.; Andersen, Kristian G.",bioRxiv,464,28

METHODS: We carried out public involvement and pilot testing in 315 volunteers to improve usability. Feedback was obtained through online discussions, questionnaires, observations and interviews of people who tried the test at home. This informed the design of a nationally representative survey of adults in England using two LFIAs (LFIA1 and LFIA2) which were sent to 10,600 and 3,800 participants, respectively, who provided further feedback. RESULTS: Public involvement and pilot testing showed high levels of acceptability, but limitations with the usability of kits. Most people reported completing the test; however, they identified difficulties with practical aspects of the kit, particularly the lancet and pipette, a need for clearer instructions and more guidance on interpretation of results. In the national study, 99.3% (8,693/8,754) of LFIA1 and 98.4% (2,911/2,957) of LFIA2 respondents attempted the test and 97.5% and 97.8% of respondents completed it, respectively. Most found the instructions easy to understand, but some reported difficulties using the pipette (LFIA1: 17.7%) and applying the blood drop to the cassette (LFIA2: 31.3%). Most respondents obtained a valid result (LFIA1: 91.5%; LFIA2: 94.4%). Overall there was substantial concordance between participant and clinician interpreted results (kappa: LFIA1 0.72; LFIA2 0.89). CONCLUSION: Impactful public involvement is feasible in a rapid response setting. Home self-testing with LFIAs can be used with a high degree of acceptability and usability by adults, making them a good option for use in seroprevalence surveys.","Atchison, Christina; Pristerà, Philippa; Cooper, Emily; Papageorgiou, Vasiliki; Redd, Rozlyn; Piggin, Maria; Flower, Barnaby; Fontana, Gianluca; Satkunarajah, Sutha; Ashrafian, Hutan; Lawrence-Jones, Anna; Naar, Lenny; Chigwende, Jennifer; Gibbard, Steve; Riley, Steven; Darzi, Ara; Elliott, Paul; Ashby, Deborah; Barclay, Wendy; Cooke, Graham S; Ward, Helen",Clin Infect Dis,464,5

METHODS: Using multi-stage sampling, a survey of public health workers involved in the prevention and control of COVID-19 was conducted from 18 February to 1 March 2020 through a self-administered questionnaire. These public health workers were from the primary health care center (defined as “primary-urban” and “primary-rural” for those in urban and rural areas, respectively) and the center for disease control and prevention (defined as “non-primary”) in five provinces including Hubei, Guangdong, Sichuan, Jiangsu and Gansu, China. RESULTS: A total of 9,475 public health workers were surveyed, of which 40.0 %, 27.0 % and 33.0 % were from the primary-rural, primary-urban and non-primary, respectively. The resources shortage were reported by 27.9 % participants, with the primary-rural being the worst affected (OR = 1.201, 95 %CI: 1.073–1.345). The difficulties in data processing were reported by 31.5 % participants, with no significant differences among institutions. The difficulties in communication and coordination were reported by 29.8 % participants, with the non-primary being the most serious (primary-rural: OR = 0.520, 95 %CI: 0.446–0.606; primary-urban: OR = 0.533, 95 %CI: 0.454–0.625). The difficulties with target audiences were reported by 20.2 % participants, with the primary-urban being the worst (OR = 1.368, 95 %CI: 1.199–1.560). The psychological distress were reported by 48.8 % participants, with no significant differences among institutions. CONCLUSIONS: Psychological distress is the most serious problem in the prevention and control of COVID-19. Resources shortage in primary-rural, difficulties in communication and coordination in non-primary, and difficulties with target audiences in the primary-urban deserve attention. This study will provide scientific evidences for improving the national public health emergency management system, especially for reducing the urban-rural differences in emergency response capacity.

Numerous efficient methods have been developed for sequence comparison, but challenges remain. In this article, we proposed a novel method to compare biological sequences based on Gaussian model. Instead of comparing the frequencies of k‐words in biological sequences directly, we considered the k‐word frequency distribution under Gaussian model which gives the different expression levels of k‐words. The proposed method was tested by similarity search, evaluation on functionally related genes, and phylogenetic analysis. The performance of our method was further compared with alignment‐based and alignment‐free methods. The results demonstrate that Gaussian model provides more information about k‐word frequencies and improves the efficiency of sequence comparison. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

We show here that the N-terminal domain (NTD) of N protein from mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a virus most closely related to SARS-CoV, employs aromatic amino acid-nucleobase stacking interactions with a triple adenosine motif to mediate high-affinity binding to single-stranded RNAs containing the transcriptional regulatory sequence (TRS) or its complement (cTRS). Stoichiometric NTD fully unwinds a TRS-cTRS duplex that mimics a transiently formed transcription intermediate in viral subgenomic RNA synthesis. Mutation of the solvent-exposed Y127, positioned on the β-platform surface of our 1.75 Å structure, binds the TRS far less tightly and is severely crippled in its RNA unwinding activity. In contrast, the C-terminal domain (CTD) exhibits no RNA unwinding activity. Viruses harboring Y127A N mutation are strongly selected against and Y127A N does not support an accessory function in MHV replication. We propose that the helix melting activity of the coronavirus N protein NTD plays a critical accessory role in subgenomic RNA synthesis and other processes requiring RNA remodeling.","Grossoehme, Nicholas E.; Li, Lichun; Keane, Sarah C.; Liu, Pinghua; Dann, Charles E.; Leibowitz, Julian L.; Giedroc, David P.",Journal of Molecular Biology,464,21

The immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines is unknown in this vulnerable population where immune compromise is common. Objective: To determine seroresponse to vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 utilizing mRNA vaccines among patients receiving maintenance dialysis. Design: Retrospective observational study. Setting: Dialysis Clinic, Inc. (DCI) outpatient dialysis clinics in the United States. Participants: All patients receiving maintenance dialysis that received two doses of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines with SARS-CoV-2 spike-antibody test results drawn at least 14 days after the second dose, as documented in the electronic health record through March 18, 2021. Exposure: Two doses of BNT162b2/Pfizer or of mRNA-1273/Moderna vaccines administered per manufacturer recommendations. Main Outcomes and Measures: Levels of immunoglobulin-G against the receptor binding domain of the S1 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen (seropositive: 2 or greater) using FDA-approved semi-quantitative chemiluminescent assay (ADVIA Centaur XP/XPT COV2G). The DCI clinical protocol for in-clinic administration included baseline and follow-up levels although initial administration of the vaccine occurred primarily elsewhere (e.g. long-term care facilities, hospitals, etc.) during the evaluation period. Hence, only post-vaccination antibody levels were reported. Results: Among 186 patients receiving maintenance dialysis from 32 clinics in 8 states tested an average of 23 days after receiving 2 vaccine doses, mean age was 68 years, with 47% women, 21% Black, 26% residents in long-term care facilities and 97% undergoing in-center hemodialysis. Overall seropositive rate was 165/186 (88.7%) with 70% at maximum titer and with no significant difference in seropositivity between BNT162b2/Pfizer (N=148) and mRNA-1273/Moderna (N=18) vaccines (88.1% vs. 94.4%, p=0.42). Among patients with COVID-19 history, seropositive rate was 38/38 (100%) with 97% at maximum titer. Conclusions and Relevance: Most patients receiving maintenance dialysis were seropositive after two doses of BNT162b2/Pfizer or mRNA-1273/Moderna vaccine. Early evidence suggests that vaccinated dialysis patients with prior COVID-19 develop robust antibody response. These results support an equitable and aggressive vaccination strategy for all eligible patients receiving maintenance dialysis, regardless of age, sex, race, ethnicity, or disability, to prevent the extremely high morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19 in this high risk population.","Lacson, E.; Argyropoulos, C.

At the time of writing, over 1.8M distinct viral genome sequences have been made publicly available, and a sophisticated nomenclature system based on phylogenetic evidence and expert manual curation has allowed the relatively rapid classification of emerging lineages of potential concern. Here, we propose a complementary approach that integrates fine-grained spatiotemporal estimates of allele frequency with unsupervised clustering of viral haplotypes, and demonstrate that multiple highly frequent genetic variants, arising within large and/or rapidly expanding SARS-CoV-2 lineages, have highly biased geographic distributions and are not adequately captured by current SARS-CoV-2 nomenclature standards. Our results advocate a partial revision of current methods used to track SARS-CoV-2 genomic diversity and highlight the importance of the application of strategies based on the systematic analysis and integration of regional data. Here we provide a complementary, completely automated and reproducible framework for the mapping of genetic diversity in time and across different geographic regions, and for the prioritization of virus variants of potential concern.

Previous studies have suggested that SARS-CoV-2 can infect human ovary, the core organ of the female reproductive system. However, it remains unclear which type of ovarian cells are easily infected by SARS-CoV-2 and whether ovarian infectivity differs from puberty to menopause. In this study, public datasets containing bulk and single-cell RNA-Seq data derived from ovarian tissues were analyzed to demonstrate the mRNA expression and protein distribution of the two key entry receptors for SARS-CoV-2—angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and type II transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2). Furthermore, an immunohistochemical study of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in human ovaries of different ages was conducted. Differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis of ovaries of different ages and with varying ovarian reserves was conducted to explore the potential functions of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the ovary. The analysis of the public datasets indicated that the co-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 was observed mostly in oocytes and partially in granulosa cells. However, no marked difference was observed in ACE2 or TMPRSS2 expression between young and old ovaries and ovaries with low and high reserves. Correspondingly, ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were detected in the human ovarian cortex and medulla, especially in oocytes of different stages, with no observed variations in their expression level in ovaries of different ages, which was consistent with the results of bioinformatic analyses. Remarkably, DEG analysis showed that a series of viral infection-related pathways were more enriched in ACE2-positive ovarian cells than in ACE2-negative ovarian cells, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may potentially target specific ovarian cells and affect ovarian function. However, further fundamental and clinical research is still needed to monitor the process of SARS-CoV-2 entry into ovarian cells and the long-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the ovarian function in recovered females.","Wu, Meng; Ma, Lingwei; Xue, Liru; Zhu, Qingqing; Zhou, Su; Dai, Jun; Yan, Wei; Zhang, Jinjin; Wang, Shixuan",Genomics,464,1

In contrast to arguments that treat populism and nationalism as either completely separate or essentially equivalent phenomena, I begin from an understanding of the two as distinct ideologies that grow from a shared foundational claim to represent an “us” versus a “them.” In part 1, I first juxtapose populism and nationalism around this common, undergirding us-them boundary to bring out their core features. I then analyze how populism and nationalism vary across the twin axes of intensity and inclusiveness to bring out their distinct sub-types. In part 2, I use this theoretical map of populism and nationalism to navigate the conceptual terrain of their intersection. I focus, in particular, on the implications of nationalist populism for those seen as “us” versus those viewed as “them,” where the “us” and “them” are determined by the dimensions of intensity and inclusiveness. In contrast to characterizations of nationalist populism in directional terms as negative, I suggest that it is instead better understood as an amplifying force that exacerbates both the positive and negative consequences of populism. All else equal, relative to populism, those beyond nationalist populist boundaries are subject to heightened hostility and discrimination, while those within benefit from enhanced life opportunities.","Singh, Prerna",Stud Comp Int Dev,464,16

Therefore, the frequency of testing, accessibility, and immediate results are critical for reopening societies until an effective vaccine becomes available for a substantial proportion of the population. The loss of sense of smell is among the earliest, most discriminant, and prevalent symptoms of COVID-19, with 75-98% prevalence when clinical olfactory tests are used. Frequent screening for olfactory dysfunction could substantially reduce viral spread. However, olfactory dysfunction is generally self-reported and not measured, which is specially problematic as partial olfactory impairment is broadly unrecognized. To address this limitation, we developed a rapid psychophysical olfactory test (KOR) deployed on a web platform for automated reporting and traceability based on a low-cost, six-odor olfactory identification kit. Based on test results, we defined an anosmia score - a classifier for olfactory impairment -, and a Bayesian Network (BN) model that incorporates other symptoms for detecting COVID-19 cases. We trained and validated the BN model on two samples: suspected COVID-19 cases in five healthcare centers (n=926; 32% COVID-19 prevalence) and healthy (asymptomatic) mining workers (n=1,365; 1.1% COVID-19 prevalence). All participants had COVID-19 assessment by RT-PCR assay. Using the BN model, we predicted COVID-19 status with 76% accuracy (AUC=0.79 [0.75-0.82]) in the healthcare sample and 84% accuracy (AUC=0.71 [0.63-0.79]) among miners. The KOR test and BN model enabled the detection of COVID-19 cases that otherwise appeared asymptomatic. Our results confirmed that olfactory dysfunction is the most discriminant symptom to predict COVID-19 status when based on olfactory function measurements. Overall, this work highlights the potential for low-cost, frequent, accessible, routine testing for COVID-19 surveillance to aid society's reopening.","Eyheramendy, S.; Saa, P. A.; Undurraga, E.

Most of these patients require critical care support because of respiratory failure or presence of multiorgan dysfunction syndrome. As there is no pharmacological therapy available, respiratory support in the form of supplemental oxygen, noninvasive ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation remains mainstay of care in intensive care units. As there is still dearth of direct evidence, most of the data are extrapolated from the experience gained from the management of general critical care patients.

No studies have examined how the SARS‐associated coronavirus (SARS‐CoV) loads in different organs with respect to time, post‐mortem. The aim of this study was to determine the quantitative temporal‐spatial distribution of SARS‐CoV in the post‐mortem tissue samples of seven patients. Quantitation of a house‐keeping gene, glyceraldehyde‐3‐phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was undertaken to standardize the amount of tissue tested. SARS‐CoV viral load and SARS‐CoV/GAPDH RNA ratio for each organ type were related to four time durations: onset of illness to death, death to post‐mortem tissue sampling, and total durations of treatment with ribavirin and hydrocortisone. The SARS‐CoV/GAPDH RNA ratio remained relatively stable in most organ tissue types for all these time durations. The ratio reached the highest value of equal to or greater than one for lung and small bowel, whereas those for heart, liver, spleen, and kidney were always less than one. It is concluded that SARS‐CoV viral loads in these organs remain relatively stable, post‐mortem. This quantitative assessment further supports SARS‐CoV has a specific tropism for the human respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, which may be related to the density of SARS‐CoV receptors. J. Med.

The COVID-19 patients with severe symptoms account for a majority of mortality of this disease. However, early detection and effective prediction of patients with mild to severe symptoms remains challenging. In this study, we performed proteomic profiling of urine samples from 32 healthy control individuals and 6 COVID-19 positive patients (3 mild and 3 severe). We found that urine proteome samples from the mild and severe COVID-19 patients with comorbidities can be clearly differentiated from healthy proteome samples based on the clustering analysis. Multiple pathways have been compromised after the COVID-19 infection, including the dysregulation of immune response, complement activation, platelet degranulation, lipoprotein metabolic process and response to hypoxia. We further validated our finding by directly comparing the same patients' urine proteome after recovery. This study demonstrates the COVID-19 pathophysiology related molecular alterations could be detected in the urine and the potential application of urinary proteome in auxiliary diagnosis, severity determination and therapy development of COVID-19.","Li, Y.; Wang, Y.; Liu, H.; Sun, W.; Ding, B.; Zhao, Y.; Chen, P.; Zhu, L.; Li, Z.; Li, N.; Chang, L.; Wang, H.; Bai, C.; Xu, P.",,464,20
