60466,Magnetic Resonance Imaging With Cochlear Implant Magnet in Place: Safety and Imaging Quality.,2015,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Rapid decision making optimizes outcomes from endovascular thrombectomy for acute cerebral ischemia. Visual displays facilitate swift review of potential outcomes and can accelerate decision processes. METHODS From patient-level, pooled randomized trial data, 100 person-icon arrays (Kuiper-Marshall personographs) were generated showing beneficial and adverse effects of endovascular thrombectomy for patients with acute cerebral ischemia and large vessel occlusion using (1) automated (algorithmic) and (2) expert-guided joint outcome table specification. RESULTS For the full 7-category modified Rankin Scale, thrombectomy added to IV tPA (intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator) alone had number needed to treat to benefit 2.9 (95% confidence interval, 2.6-3.3) and number needed to harm 68.9 (95% confidence interval, 40-250); thrombectomy for patients ineligible for IV tPA had number needed to treat to benefit 2.3 (95% confidence interval, 2.1-2.5) and number needed to harm 100 (95% confidence interval, 62.5-250). Visual displays of treatment effects on 100 patients showed: with thrombectomy added to IV tPA alone, 34 patients have better disability outcome, including 14 more normal or near normal (modified Rankin Scale, 0-1); with thrombectomy for patients ineligible for IV tPA, 44 patients have a better disability outcome, including 16 more normal or nearly normal. Displays also showed that harm (increased modified Rankin Scale final disability) occurred in 1 of 100 patients in both populations, mediated by increased new territory infarcts. The person-icon figures integrated these outcomes, and early side-effects, in a single display. CONCLUSIONS Visual decision aids are now available to rapidly educate healthcare providers, patients, and families about benefits and risks of endovascular thrombectomy, both when added to IV tPA in tPA-eligible patients and as the sole reperfusion treatment in tPA-ineligible patients.","Tokunboh, Ivie; Vales Montero, Marta; Zopelaro Almeida, Matheus Fellipe; Sharma, Latisha; Starkman, Sidney; Szeder, Viktor; Jahan, Reza; Liebeskind, David; Gonzalez, Nestor; Demchuk, Andrew; Froehler, Michael T; Goyal, Mayank; Lansberg, Maarten G; Lutsep, Helmi; Schwamm, Lee; Saver, Jeffrey L",Stroke,https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.117.018715; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29222229/,845
62213,Intracranial Complications From Temporal Bone Cystic Angiomatosis.,2017,"BACKGROUND Video-assisted thoracoscopic lobectomy was introduced in the early 1990s but has not yet gained widespread acceptance. The VATS approach is still controversial although several studies suggest less postoperative morbidity compared with open thoracotomy. Nevertheless, some patients report long-lasting chest wall pain following VATS procedures, and, in theory, such pain may be related to intercostal nerve injury. The present study presents our experience with a commercially available flexible thoracoscope. METHODS The study was designed as a case-control series of prospectively collected data to determine if performing VATS with a flexible thorascope could have benefits for both the patient and the surgeon. RESULTS During the last 24 months 128 of 274 consecutive lobectomies (47%) were scheduled as VATS procedures with a new flexible high-definition thoracoscope. Six operations (4.6%) were converted to open surgery but only one case was converted during the last 12 months. There was no hospital mortality. The median duration of the operation was 105 min (range: 50-289 min), and the median postoperative hospital stay was 4 days (range: 2-27 days). At routine follow-up 2 weeks postoperatively all but three patients (2%) were considered pain free, which was significantly less than in 15 consecutive VATS lobectomies with rigid thoracoscopy performed prior to the introduction of flexible VATS (p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS Video-assisted thoracoscopic lobectomy by flexible thoracoscopy is feasible and in our opinion easier and safer compared with rigid thoracoscopy. In our experience all parts of the operation are better visualized and many surgical pitfalls may be avoided. Even during early phases of setting up the VATS lobectomy program, the duration of the operation is comparable with open surgery, and postoperative pain is low, possibly because porthole angulation is minimized.","Licht, Peter B; Ladegaard, Lars",World journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00268-010-0468-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20177684/,845
65260,A novel method of 3D image analysis of high-resolution cone beam CT and multi slice CT for the detection of semicircular canal dehiscence.,2014,"The pathophysiology of refractory chronic cough (RCC) is unclear. We hypothesised that endogenous inhibitory control mechanisms, such as those activated by noxiousstimuli inducing pain (conditioned pain modulation (CPM)), may be capable of inhibiting coughing and urge to cough evoked by inhaled capsaicin. Furthermore, these mechanisms may be impaired in patients with RCC.The objective was to investigate the effects of pain on cough and urge to cough (UTC) in healthy volunteers (HV) and RCC. HV and RCC patients underwent a randomised, controlled, 4-way cross-over study comparing the effect of 4 interventions on capsaicin evoked coughing and UTC. The interventions comprised immersing a hand in i) noxious cold-water, ii) warm water, iii) warm water but instructed to voluntarily supress coughing and iv) no intervention. The co-primary outcomes were numbers of evoked coughs and UTC scores.Twenty HV (mean age 50.1(±SD14.2), M:F 10:10) and 20 RCC (age 60.1(±7.9), M:F 9:11) participated. Overall, noxious cold water reduced capsaicin evoked UTC scores and cough numbers compared with warm water (1.6 (95% C.I. 1.3-2.0) versus 2.2 (1.8-2.6) p<0.001; 4.8 coughs (3.7-6.2) versus 7.9 coughs (6.7-9.5) p<0.001, respectively). HV and RCC demonstrated similar reductions in the UTC during noxious cold-water immersion, but noxious cold water and voluntary suppression interventions were less effective in RCC than HV in reducing capsaicin evoked cough (p=0.041).Endogenous inhibitory control mechanisms, specifically those activated by pain, can reduce both coughing and the UTC. Impairment of endogenous inhibitory control mechanisms may contribute to excessive coughing in RCC.","Hilton, Emma; Satia, Imran; Holt, Kimberley; Woodcock, Ashley A; Belcher, John; Smith, Jaclyn A",The European respiratory journal,https://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.01387-2020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32703776/,845
65431,Side-to-end hypoglossal to facial anastomosis with transposition of the intratemporal facial nerve.,2014,"This personal view, regarding the value of healthcare support worker (HCSW) assistantships, is based on our experiences as medical students entering our final year, having both worked as HCSW's during the COVID-19 pandemic, and from SC's experience as a HCSW before and throughout medical school. HCSW's provide a large proportion of the basic care patients receive on the wards, in clinics and primary care. The proximity to patients attracts individuals with excellent communication skills and bedside manner, and means they are well-positioned to assist in the management of both the general wellbeing of patients and equally, to recognise the signs of a deteriorating patient making them a versatile and invaluable member of the multidisciplinary team (MDT). This piece aims to highlight the value of our time spent working as a HCSWs, thus promoting the formation of a mandatory assistantship for medical students, like that seen in Germany. Through this, essential communication skills, empathy, 'ward smarts' and an appreciation for the wider MDT can be gained in a way that typical clinical attachments and classroom teaching do not replicate.","Cowley, Samuel; White, Gemma",Medical teacher,https://doi.org/10.1080/0142159x.2020.1817351; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32990112/,845

70217,"A Systematic Review of Cochlear Implant Outcomes in Prelingually-deafened, Late-implanted Patients.",2020-01-13,"OBJECTIVE To study the correlation between fungal colonization and bacterial pneumonia and to test the effect of antifungal treatments on the development of bacterial pneumonia in colonized rats. DESIGN Experimental animal investigation. SETTING University research laboratory. SUBJECTS Pathogen-free male Wistar rats weighing 250-275 g. INTERVENTIONS Rats were colonized by intratracheal instillation of Candida albicans. Fungal clearance from the lungs and immune response were measured. Both colonized and noncolonized animals were secondarily instilled with different bacterial species (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, or Staphylococcus aureus). Bacterial phagocytosis by alveolar macrophages was evaluated in the presence of interferon-gamma, the main cytokine produced during fungal colonization. The effect of antifungal treatments on fungal colonization and its immune response were assessed. The prevalence of P. aeruginosa pneumonia was compared in antifungal treated and control colonized rats. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS C. albicans was slowly cleared and induced a Th1-Th17 immune response with very high interferon-gamma concentrations. Airway fungal colonization favored the development of bacterial pneumonia. Interferon-gamma was able to inhibit the phagocytosis of unopsonized bacteria by alveolar macrophages. Antifungal treatment decreased airway fungal colonization, lung interferon-gamma levels and, consequently, the prevalence of subsequent bacterial pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS C. albicans airway colonization elicited a Th1-Th17 immune response that favored the development of bacterial pneumonia via the inhibition of bacterial phagocytosis by alveolar macrophages. Antifungal treatment decreased the risk of bacterial pneumonia in colonized rats.","Roux, Damien; Gaudry, Stéphane; Khoy-Ear, Linda; Aloulou, Meryem; Phillips-Houlbracq, Mathilde; Bex, Julie; Skurnik, David; Denamur, Erick; Monteiro, Renato C; Dreyfuss, Didier; Ricard, Jean-Damien",Critical care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/ccm.0b013e31828a25d6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23887232/,845
78317,The Effect of Cochlear Implantation on Tinnitus and Quality of Life: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,2021-05-10,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES We present 2 cases of laparoendoscopic single site surgery (LESS) splenectomy performed with a conventional laparoscope and instruments, and the use of a novel internal retraction device. METHODS One patient underwent LESS splenectomy for idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP), and a pediatric patient with sickle cell disease underwent LESS splenectomy and cholecystectomy. In each case, a 2-cm vertical incision was made within the confines of the umbilical ring, and a SILS port (Covidien, Norwalk CT) inserted. A 5-mm, 30-degree laparoscope and standard 5-mm instruments were used. After isolation of the splenic hilum, one 5-mm trocar of the SILS port was upsized to 12mm, and a laparoscopic stapler was used to divide the splenic artery and vein. An internal retractor consisting of a laparoscopic bulldog clamp with a hook attachment was used to retract the gallbladder, and to secure the specimen retrieval bag during splenic extraction, which eliminated the need for a fourth trocar. RESULTS Total operative time was 160 minutes for the LESS splenectomy, and 216 minutes for the LESS splenectomy and cholecystectomy. Both procedures were successfully completed with conventional instrumentation and a SILS port, without the need for additional incisions or trocars. No complications occurred, and both patients had an uneventful recovery. CONCLUSIONS LESS splenectomy is a feasible procedure that can be performed safely. Although articulating instruments and laparoscopes may offer advantages, they are not necessary for performing LESS splenectomy.","Colon, Modesto J; Telem, Dana; Chan, Edward; Midulla, Peter; Divino, Celia; Chin, Edward H",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.4293/108680811x13125733356918; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21985729/,845
78371,Does electrocautery damage cochlear implants?,2015,"PURPOSE To describe the use of an imaging selection tool, multiphase computed tomographic (CT) angiography, in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and to demonstrate its interrater reliability and ability to help determine clinical outcome. MATERIALS AND METHODS The local ethics board approved this study. Data are from the pilot phase of PRoveIT, a prospective observational study analyzing utility of multimodal imaging in the triage of patients with AIS. Patients underwent baseline unenhanced CT, single-phase CT angiography of the head and neck, multiphase CT angiography, and perfusion CT. Multiphase CT angiography generates time-resolved images of pial arteries. Pial arterial filling was scored on a six-point ordinal scale, and interrater reliability was tested. Clinical outcomes included a 50% or greater decrease in National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) over 24 hours and 90-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 0-2. The ability to predict clinical outcomes was compared between single-phase CT angiography, multiphase CT angiography, and perfusion CT by using receiver operating curve analysis, Akaike information criterion (AIC), and Bayesian information criterion (BIC). RESULTS A total of 147 patients were included. Interrater reliability for multiphase CT angiography is excellent (n = 30, κ = 0.81, P < .001). At receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, the ability to predict clinical outcome is modest (C statistic = 0.56, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.52, 0.63 for ≥50% decrease in NIHSS over 24 hours; C statistic = 0.6, 95% CI: 0.53, 0.68 for 90-day mRS score of 0-2) but better than that of models using single-phase CT angiography and perfusion CT (P < .05 overall). With AIC and BIC, models that use multiphase CT angiography are better than models that use single-phase CT angiography and perfusion CT for a decrease of 50% or more in NIHSS over 24 hours (AIC = 166, BIC = 171.7; values were lowest for multiphase CT angiography) and a 90-day mRS score of 0-2 (AIC = 132.1, BIC = 137.4; values were lowest for multiphase CT angiography). CONCLUSION Multiphase CT angiography is a reliable tool for imaging selection in patients with AIS.","Menon, Bijoy K; d'Esterre, Christopher D; Qazi, Emmad M; Almekhlafi, Mohammed; Hahn, Leszek; Demchuk, Andrew M; Goyal, Mayank",Radiology,https://doi.org/10.1148/radiol.15142256; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25633505/,845
91304,Intratympanic Steroid for Menière's Disease: A Systematic Review.,2019,"Cellular therapy exerts profound therapeutic potential for curing a broad spectrum of diseases. Adult stem cells reside within a specified dynamic niche in vivo, which is essential for continuous tissue homeostatic maintenance through balancing self-renewal with lineage selection. Meanwhile, adult stem cells may be multipotent or unipotent, and are present in both quiescent and actively dividing states in vivo of the mammalians, which may switch to each other state in response to biophysical cues through mitochondria-mediated mechanisms, such as alterations in mitochondrial respiration and metabolism. In general, stem cells facilitate tissue repair after tissue-specific homing through various mechanisms, including immunomodulation of local microenvironment, differentiation into functional cells, cell ""empowerment"" via paracrine secretion, immunoregulation, and intercellular mitochondrial transfer. Interestingly, cell-source-specific features have been reported between different tissue-derived adult stem cells with distinct functional properties due to the different microenvironments in vivo, as well as differential functional properties in different tissue-derived stem cell-derived extracellular vehicles, mitochondrial metabolism, and mitochondrial transfer capacity. Here, we summarized the current understanding on roles of mitochondrial dynamics during stem cell homeostasis and aging, and lineage-specific differentiation. Also, we proposed potential unique mitochondrial molecular signature features between different source-derived stem cells and potential associations between stem cell aging and mitochondria-endoplasmic reticulum (ER) communication, as well as potential novel strategies for anti-aging intervention and healthy aging.","Lin, Weiping; Chen, Shuxun; Wang, Yan; Wang, Ming; Lee, Wayne Yuk-Wai; Jiang, Xiaohua; Li, Gang",Cell death & disease,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41419-021-03912-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34400615/,845
95676,"How reliable is the ""scratch test"" versus the Weber test after tympanomastoid surgery?",2014,"BACKGROUND As the pandemic process, COVID-19 has a serious occupational safety risk for healthcare professionals. Therefore, determining their health and safety perceptions and attitudes in the pandemic process is very important. This study aims to determine which is more effective in work accident prevention behavior: safety awareness and competencies of healthcare professionals or perception of fatalism. METHOD For this purpose, a questionnaire was applied to 326 healthcare professionals. The questionnaire consists of four parts: (1) demographic information of the employees, (2) scale of preventing occupational accidents, (3) fatalism perception scale in occupational health and safety, and (4) security awareness and competency scale. Descriptive statistical methods, multiple regression and correlation analysis were used in the analysis of the data. RESULTS It was determined that the participants' safety awareness and competencies were at the high level and their fatalism perceptions were at the low level. The average of the responses given by the participants to the scale of preventing work accidents was above the middle level. According to the study, the safety awareness and competencies of health workers were found to be about three times more effective on the behavior of preventing work accidents than the perception of fatalism. CONCLUSION In conclusion, it is important to recommend managers to take the step to increase the safety awareness and competencies of those working in their institutions.","Ünal, Özgün",Work,https://doi.org/10.3233/wor-203327; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33325425/,845

Objective To determine whether preoperative NT-proBNP has additional predictive value beyond a clinical risk score for the composite of vascular death and myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery (MINS) within 30 days after surgery. Design Prospective cohort study. Setting 16 hospitals in 9 countries. Patients 10 402 patients aged 45 years or older having inpatient noncardiac surgery. Measurements All patients had NT-proBNP levels measured before surgery and troponin T levels measured daily for up to 3 days after surgery. Results In multivariable analyses, compared with preoperative NT-proBNP values less than 100 pg/mL (the reference group), those of 100 to less than 200 pg/mL, 200 to less than 1500 pg/mL, and 1500 pg/mL or greater were associated with adjusted hazard ratios of 2.27 (95% CI, 1.90 to 2.70), 3.63 (CI, 3.13 to 4.21), and 5.82 (CI, 4.81 to 7.05) and corresponding incidences of the primary outcome of 12.3% (226 of 1843), 20.8% (542 of 2608), and 37.5% (223 of 595), respectively. Adding NT-proBNP thresholds to clinical stratification (that is, the Revised Cardiac Risk Index [RCRI]) resulted in a net absolute reclassification improvement of 258 per 1000 patients. Preoperative NT-proBNP values were also statistically significantly associated with 30-day all-cause mortality (less than 100 pg/mL [incidence, 0.3%], 100 to less than 200 pg/mL [incidence, 0.7%], 200 to less than 1500 pg/mL [incidence, 1.4%], and 1500 pg/mL or greater [incidence, 4.0%]). Limitation External validation of the identified NT-proBNP thresholds in other cohorts would reinforce our findings. Conclusion Preoperative NT-proBNP is strongly associated with vascular death and MINS within 30 days after noncardiac surgery and improves cardiac risk prediction in addition to the RCRI.

To the authors' knowledge, there are no data in the literature on this phenomenon in patients undergoing total joint arthroplasty. They hypothesized that there would be an increased infection rate in the summer months in patients undergoing elective total joint arthroplasty. They retrospectively reviewed consecutive patients undergoing elective total hip or knee arthroplasty at a single institution during 1 year by a single surgeon. Wound infections were defined as any patient requiring oral antibiotics for cellulitis, readmission for intravenous antibiotics, a return to the operating room for irrigation and debridement, or excisional arthroplasty and placement of a cement spacer within 90 days of the initial procedure. Seventeen of 750 patients developed an infection, for an overall incidence of 2.2%. There was a statistically significant difference in infection rate according to season: 3 (1.5%) infections occurred in winter, 1 (0.5%) in spring, 9 (4.7%) in summer, and 4 (2.4%) in fall. The incidence was highest during July (4.5%), August (5.4%), and September (4.3%). There was a statistically significant difference in infection rate between summer/fall (3.6%) vs winter/spring (1.0%). There is an increase in the incidence of infection during summer months for patients undergoing total joint arthroplasty.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Nine patients underwent simultaneous static and dynamic VUS examination and videofluoroscopy (VFS) of swallowing. RESULTS At the static phase, VUS showed 5/9 patients had lingual atrophy. Abnormal bolus position was observed in 6/9 patients at VUS and 3/9 at VFS. Both techniques identified an inability to keep the bolus in the oral cavity in 4/9 patients. At the dynamic phase, reduced lingual movement was observed in 5/9 patients at VUS and 2/9 at VFS. Disorganised tongue movement was seen in 3/9 patients at VUS and in 2/9 at VFS. Fragmented swallowing was only visualised at VUS. Stagnation of ingested material was never visualised at VUS, whereas it was clearly depicted in 2/9 patients at VFS. CONCLUSIONS VUS can be integrated into the diagnostic protocol for evaluating swallowing in patients with ALS, as it has higher sensitivity than VFS in assessing the dynamic factors that represent the early signs of dysphagia.","Tamburrini, S; Solazzo, A; Sagnelli, A; Del Vecchio, L; Reginelli, A; Monsorrò, M; Grassi, R",La Radiologia medica,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11547-010-0523-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20174881/,845
136478,Effects of body tilt on multifrequency admittance tympanometry.,2015,"INTRODUCTION hospital malnutrition is a highly prevalent problem and continues to be a pending issue today, often unnoticed by health personnel, with the negative clinical impact this entails. OBJECTIVES a) to evaluate nutritional status upon admission; b) to assess the outcome after a week of hospitalization; c) to analyze the relationship between nutritional status and different clinical variables (specialty, age, body weight loss, length of stay, readmissions, and consultations to the endocrinology-nutrition department). METHODS an observational, prospective, analytical, randomized study in 260 patients from medical and surgical services, nutritionally evaluated on admission and after seven days of hospitalization using the SGA and NRS-2002. RESULTS prevalence at admission according to the SGA was 48 % and according to NRS-2002, 38.5 %. After a week of hospitalization it increased to 72.5 % and 58.8 %, respectively. After seven days, 2-7.8 % of subjects improved their nutritional status, while 16-27.5 % worsened. Malnutrition on admission was associated with longer stay (6 days for non-malnourished vs 8 days for malnourished); with older age (64 years for non-malnourished vs 71 years for malnourished); with medical vs surgical specialties (44-53 % vs 20-32 %); with weight loss (on admission they had lost 2.1 kg on average as compared to usual weight, and 0.9 kg after seven days of hospitalization); and with premature readmission (8-11 % for non-malnourished vs 27 % for malnourished), among others. CONCLUSIONS the study's results offer an overview of hospital malnutrition, showing how patients evolve nutritionally during hospitalization, and which are the crucial moments for action. It is extremely important that health personnel will become aware and take action.","Villaverde Núñez, Alberto; Pérez Ramos, Cristina; Sanz Lobo, María Victoria; Morgado Benito, María Del Carmen; Martínez Ibáñez, Virginia; Avecilla Nieto, Noelia; Antón Rodríguez, Cristina",Nutricion hospitalaria,https://doi.org/10.20960/nh.03499; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34080436/,845

METHODS AND RESULTS Newly diagnosed patients with AF and CHA2 DS2 -VASc score ≥ 1 were consecutively enrolled. Baseline characteristics were assessed by the presence or absence of HF diagnosis at enrolment. Incidence rates for outcomes in dabigatran-treated patients were estimated with and without standardization by stroke (excluding HF component) and bleeding risk scores. A total of 15 308 eligible patients were enrolled, including 15 154 with known HF status; of these, 3679 (24.0%) had been diagnosed with HF, 11 475 (75.0%) had not. Among 4873 dabigatran-treated patients, 1169 (24.0%) had HF, and 3658 (75.1%) did not; the risk of stroke was high (CHA2 DS2 -VASc score ≥ 2) for 94.3% of patients with HF and 85.8% without, while 6.0% and 7.0%, respectively, had a high bleeding risk (HAS-BLED ≥ 3). Incidence rates of all-cause death in dabigatran-treated patients with and without HF, standardized for CHA2 DS2 -VASc and HAS-BLED scores, were 4.76 vs. 1.80 per 100 patient years (py), with roughly comparable rates of stroke (0.82 vs. 0.60 per 100 py) and major bleeding (1.20 vs. 0.92 per 100 py). CONCLUSIONS Patients with AF and history of HF may have greater disease burden at AF diagnosis and increased mortality rates vs. patients without HF. Stroke and major bleeding rates were roughly comparable between groups confirming the long-term safety and effectiveness of dabigatran in patients with HF.","Dubner, Sergio J; Teutsch, Christine; Huisman, Menno V; Diener, Hans-Christoph; Halperin, Jonathan; Rothman, Kenneth J; Ma, Chang-Sheng; Chuquiure-Valenzuela, Eduardo; Bergler-Klein, Jutta; Zint, Kristina; Riou França, Lionel; Lu, Shihai; Paquette, Miney; Lip, Gregory Y H",ESC heart failure,https://doi.org/10.1002/ehf2.12857; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32613745/,845
148874,Early Experience With Telemedicine in Patients Undergoing Otologic/Neurotologic Procedures.,2020-08-05,"In the twenty-first century, ticks and tick-borne diseases have expanded their ranges and impact across the US. With this spread, it has become vital to monitor vector and disease distributions, as these shifts have public health implications. Typically, tick-borne disease surveillance (e.g., Lyme disease) is passive and relies on case reports, while disease risk is calculated using active surveillance, where researchers collect ticks from the environment. Case reports provide the basis for estimating the number of cases; however, they provide minimal information on vector population or pathogen dynamics. Active surveillance monitors ticks and sylvatic pathogens at local scales, but it is resource-intensive. As a result, data are often sparse and aggregated across time and space to increase statistical power to model or identify range changes. Engaging public participation in surveillance efforts allows spatially and temporally diverse samples to be collected with minimal effort. These citizen-driven tick collections have the potential to provide a powerful tool for tracking vector and pathogen changes. We used MaxEnt species distribution models to predict the current and future distribution of Ixodes pacificus across the Western US through the use of a nationwide citizen science tick collection program. Here, we present niche models produced through citizen science tick collections over two years. Despite obvious limitations with citizen science collections, the models are consistent with previously-predicted species ranges in California that utilized more than thirty years of traditional surveillance data. Additionally, citizen science allows for an expanded understanding of I. pacificus distribution in Oregon and Washington. With the potential for rapid environmental changes instigated by a burgeoning human population and rapid climate change, the development of tools, concepts, and methodologies that provide rapid, current, and accurate assessment of important ecological qualities will be invaluable for monitoring and predicting disease across time and space.","Porter, W Tanner; Barrand, Zachary A; Wachara, Julie; DaVall, Kaila; Mihaljevic, Joseph R; Pearson, Talima; Salkeld, Daniel J; Nieto, Nathan C",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0244754; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33400719/,845

We propose a novel method that uses viral load data collected over time since hospitalization, hindcasting the timing of infection with a mathematical model for viral dynamics. As an example, we used reported data on viral load for 30 hospitalized patients from multiple countries (Singapore, China, Germany, and Korea) and estimated the incubation period. The median, 2.5, and 97.5 percentiles of the incubation period were 5.85 days (95 % CI: 5.05, 6.77), 2.65 days (2.04, 3.41), and 12.99 days (9.98, 16.79), respectively, which are comparable to the values estimated in previous studies.

Strong, Th1-skewed T cell responses can drive protective humoral and cell-mediated immune responses2 and might reduce the potential for disease enhancement3. Cytotoxic T cells clear virus-infected host cells and contribute to control of infection4. Studies of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 have suggested a protective role for both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses in recovery from COVID-19 (refs. 5,6). ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222) is a candidate SARS-CoV-2 vaccine comprising a replication-deficient simian adenovirus expressing full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. We recently reported preliminary safety and immunogenicity data from a phase 1/2 trial of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine (NCT04400838)7 given as either a one- or two-dose regimen. The vaccine was tolerated, with induction of neutralizing antibodies and antigen-specific T cells against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Here we describe, in detail, exploratory analyses of the immune responses in adults, aged 18-55 years, up to 8 weeks after vaccination with a single dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 in this trial, demonstrating an induction of a Th1-biased response characterized by interferon-Î³ and tumor necrosis factor-&#945; cytokine secretion by CD4+ T cells and antibody production predominantly of IgG1 and IgG3 subclasses. CD8+ T cells, of monofunctional, polyfunctional and cytotoxic phenotypes, were also induced. Taken together, these results suggest a favorable immune profile induced by ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine, supporting the progression of this vaccine candidate to ongoing phase 2/3 trials to assess vaccine efficacy.","Ewer, Katie J; Barrett, Jordan R; Belij-Rammerstorfer, Sandra; Sharpe, Hannah; Makinson, Rebecca; Morter, Richard; Flaxman, Amy; Wright, Daniel; Bellamy, Duncan; Bittaye, Mustapha; Dold, Christina; Provine, Nicholas M; Aboagye, Jeremy; Fowler, Jamie; Silk, Sarah E; Alderson, Jennifer; Aley, Parvinder K; Angus, Brian; Berrie, Eleanor; Bibi, Sagida; Cicconi, Paola; Clutterbuck, Elizabeth A; Chelysheva, Irina; Folegatti, Pedro M; Fuskova, Michelle; Green, Catherine M; Jenkin, Daniel; Kerridge, Simon; Lawrie, Alison; Minassian, Angela M; Moore, Maria; Mujadidi, Yama; Plested, Emma; Poulton, Ian; Ramasamy, Maheshi N; Robinson, Hannah; Song, Rinn; Snape, Matthew D; Tarrant, Richard; Voysey, Merryn; Watson, Marion E E; Douglas, Alexander D; Hill, Adrian V S; Gilbert, Sarah C; Pollard, Andrew J; Lambe, Teresa",Nat. med,,845

Although pregnancy may be a risk factor in respiratory virus infections, there are no considerable differences regarding COVID-19 severity observed between pregnant and nonpregnant women. In these circumstances, an emergent concern is the possibility of neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric harm for the offspring of infected mothers. Currently, there is no stronger evidence indicating vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2; however, the exacerbated inflammatory response observed in the disease could lead to several impairments in the offspring's brain. Furthermore, in the face of historical knowledge on possible long-term consequences for the progeny's brain after infection by viruses, we must consider that this might be another deleterious facet of COVID-19.

A planned and purposeful transition process is often non-existent or experienced negatively by youth and their caregivers. Stakeholders, including youth and their caregivers, have demanded interventions to support more effective transitions, such a transition navigator. The transition navigator model uses a navigator to facilitate complex transitions from acute care CAMHS to community or AMHS. However, despite the widespread implementation of this model, there has been no evaluation of the programme, hindering its scalability. This paper describes the study protocol of the Navigator Evaluation Advancing Transitions study that aims to collaborate with patients, caregivers and clinicians in the evaluation of the navigator model. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A pre and post mixed-method study will be conducted, using the Triple Aim Framework, to evaluate the navigator model. We will recruit participants from one large tertiary and two community hospitals in Toronto, Canada. For the quantitative portion of the study, we will recruit a sample of 45 youth (15 at each site), aged 16–18, and their caregivers at baseline (referral to navigator) (T1) and 6 months (T2). Youth and caregiver participants will complete a set of standardised measures to assess mental health, service utilisation, and satisfaction outcomes. For the qualitative portion of the study, semistructured interviews will be conducted at 6 months (T2) with youth, their caregivers and clinicians to better understand their experience and satisfaction with the model. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Research Ethics Board (REB) approval has been obtained from the lead research sites, the University of Toronto and the Hospital for Sick Children.
