6910,Intravascular large B-cell lymphoma with diffuse FDG uptake in the lung by (18)FDG-PET/CT without chest CT findings,2012-04-27,"Intravenous brentuximab vedotin (ADCETRIS(®)) is a targeted antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) active against CD30-positive cancer cells such as those associated with classical Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). In noncomparative, phase 2 trials and in the real-world setting, salvage therapy with brentuximab vedotin resulted in high objective response (complete plus partial remission) rates in patients with relapsed or refractory CD30-positive HL, including as retreatment in patients who had an objective response to previous brentuximab vedotin therapy and subsequently relapsed. These beneficial outcomes were durable during long-term follow-up. As consolidation therapy after autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplant (ASCT) in the multinational, phase 3 AETHERA trial, brentuximab vedotin prolonged progression-free-survival (PFS) compared with placebo at a median follow-up of 30 months (primary analysis), with a 43% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death. The beneficial effects of brentuximab vedotin consolidation therapy were maintained during long-term follow-up. In the clinical trial and real-world setting, brentuximab vedotin had an acceptable tolerability and safety profile, with most adverse events manageable with dose reductions and/or delays [including peripheral sensory neuropathy (PSN) and neutropenia]. With a paucity of treatments available for many patients with relapsed or refractory HL, brentuximab vedotin represents an important option for the management of patients who have failed high-dose chemotherapy/ASCT or at least two prior chemotherapy regimens and as post-ASCT consolidation therapy in patients who are at increased risk/high-risk of relapse or progression after ASCT.","Scott, Lesley J.",Drugs,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102329/,518
14927,Correction: Study protocol: a prospective cohort on non-communicable diseases among primary healthcare users living in Kosovo (KOSCO),2021-01-20,"BACKGROUND: The healthcare setting is stressful for many people, especially children. Efforts are needed to mitigate children’s healthcare-related anxiety. Medical play using the Teddy Bear Hospital (TBH) concept can expose children to healthcare settings and help them develop positive experiences in these settings. In this role-playing game, children bring their soft toys and act as parents to the ‘sick’ teddies in a pretend hospital or clinic play setting. The objective of this systematic review is to evaluate the effectiveness of the TBH in improving children’s health outcomes and well-being. METHODS: We searched the reference lists of included studies from four electronic databases (PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus and Google Scholar) from inception until November 2020. We included pre-post, quasiexperimental and case–control studies, as well as randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that discussed medical play using the TBH concept as an intervention. Studies that involved sick patients and used interventions unlike the TBH were excluded. We assessed the quality of the included studies using the Cochrane Collaboration’s ‘Risk of bias’ tool. RESULTS: Ten studies were included in this systematic review. Five specifically investigated the TBH method, while the others involved the same concept of medical play. Only three studies were RCTs. All of the studies report more than one outcome—mostly positive outcomes. Two report lower anxiety levels after intervention. Two found better healthcare knowledge, with one reporting increased feelings of happiness regarding visiting a doctor. Two studies found no change in anxiety or feelings, while another two found increased levels of fear and lowered mood after the medical play (which involved real medical equipment). CONCLUSIONS: The practice of TBH has mostly positive outcomes, with lower anxiety levels and improved healthcare knowledge. Its effectiveness should be verified in future studies using a more robust methodology.

However, these models are difficult to optimize for fast inference at scale without accuracy loss in von Neumann architectures due to non-uniform memory access patterns. Recently, we proposed a novel analog content addressable memory (CAM) based on emerging memristor devices for fast look-up table operations. Here, we propose for the first time to use the analog CAM as an in-memory computational primitive to accelerate tree-based model inference. We demonstrate an efficient mapping algorithm leveraging the new analog CAM capabilities such that each root to leaf path of a Decision Tree is programmed into a row. This new in-memory compute concept for enables few-cycle model inference, dramatically increasing 10(3) × the throughput over conventional approaches.","Pedretti, Giacomo; Graves, Catherine E.; Serebryakov, Sergey; Mao, Ruibin; Sheng, Xia; Foltin, Martin; Li, Can; Strachan, John Paul",Nat Commun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8490381/,518

Fe/Ni catalyst was successfully applied in the treatment of the flowback fluid for the first time in this paper. The effects of different oxidants and catalysts on the treatment of fracturing flowback were investigated. Electrolytic brine was an optimal oxidation gel breaker and molecular sieve loaded with Fe/Ni as catalyst for the treatment of fracturing flowback. Fe/Ni catalyst was characterized by SEM, EDS analysis, TEM and XRD, and the catalytic effect of the Fe/Ni proportion was explored. Fracturing flowback that dealt with catalytic oxidation was mixed with polyaluminum chloride (PAC) and polyacrylamide (PAM) for flocculation and sedimentation, through a filter, and was continuously treated for 20 days to simulate on-site operation. Finally, the suspended solids (SS) content of the fracturing flowback was steadily less than 15 mg/L, which meets the reinjection standard of fracturing flowback (SY/T 5329-2012 (China)). Hence, electrolytic brine-catalyzed oxidation treatment of high viscosity fracturing flowback possess broad application prospects.","Si, Shaoxiong; Gong, Zhaobo; Yang, Yongxia; Liu, Shengli; Wang, Yu; Wang, Xinghua",Water science and technology : a journal of the International Association on Water Pollution Research,https://doi.org/10.2166/wst.2020.496; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33263593/,518
61022,A hard time to die: grief and the coronavirus: Michael Boland.,2020-07-01,"BACKGROUND Enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) has been sporadically reported as a cause of respiratory tract infections. In 2014, an international outbreak of EV-D68 occurred and caused severe respiratory disease in the pediatric population. METHODS A retrospective chart review was performed of children admitted to Children's Mercy Hospital from August 1-September 15, 2014 with positive multiplex PCR testing for enterovirus/rhinovirus (EV/RV). Specimens were subsequently tested for EV-D68, and clinical data were obtained from the medical records. Patients with EV-D68 were compared with children presenting simultaneously with other EV/RV. RESULTS Of 542 eligible specimens, children with EV-D68 were significantly older than children with other EV/RV (4.6 vs. 2.2 years, P<0.001). Children with EV-D68 were more likely to have a history of asthma (38.6% vs. 30.0%, P=0.04) or recurrent wheezing (22.1% vs. 14.8%, P=0.04). EV-D68 positive children more commonly received supplemental oxygen (86.7% vs. 65.0%, P<0.001), albuterol (91.2% vs. 65.5%, P<0.001), and corticosteroids (82.9% vs. 58.6%, P<0.001). Age ≥5 years was an independent risk factor for intensive care unit (ICU) management in EV-D68 infected children. Children with a history of asthma or recurrent wheezing and EV-D68 received supplemental oxygen (92.7% vs. 82.4%, P=0.007) and magnesium (42.7% vs. 29.7%, P=0.03) at higher rates and more continuous albuterol (3 vs. 2 hours, P=0.03) than those with other EV/RV. CONCLUSIONS EV-D68 causes severe disease in the pediatric population, particularly in children with a history of asthma or recurrent wheezing. EV-D68 positive children are more likely to require therapy for refractory bronchospasm and may need ICU level care.","Schuster, Jennifer E; Selvarangan, Rangaraj; Hassan, Ferdaus; Briggs, Kayla B; Hays, Lindsay; Miller, Jenna O; Pahud, Barbara; Puls, Henry T; Queen, Mary Ann; Thompson, Marita T; Weddle, Gina; Jackson, Mary Anne",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,https://doi.org/10.1097/inf.0000000000001421; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28187065/,518

63438,Debrief: Joining the cult.,2020-05-01,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Radiologic selection criteria to identify patients likely to benefit from endovascular stroke treatment are still controversial. In this post hoc analysis of the recent randomized Sedation versus Intubation for Endovascular Stroke TreAtment (SIESTA) trial, we aimed to investigate the impact of sedation mode (conscious sedation versus general anesthesia) on the predictive value of collateral status. MATERIALS AND METHODS Using imaging data from SIESTA, we assessed collateral status with the collateral score of Tan et al and graded it from absent to good collaterals (0-3). We examined the association of collateral status with 24-hour improvement of the NIHSS score, infarct volume, and mRS at 3 months according to the sedation regimen. RESULTS In a cohort of 104 patients, the NIHSS score improved significantly in patients with moderate or good collaterals (2-3) compared with patients with no or poor collaterals (0-1) (P = .011; mean, -5.8 ± 7.6 versus -1.1 ± 10.7). Tan 2-3 was also associated with significantly higher ASPECTS before endovascular stroke treatment (median, 9 versus 7; P < .001) and smaller mean infarct size after endovascular stroke treatment (median, 35.0 versus 107.4; P < .001). When we differentiated the population according to collateral status (0.1 versus 2.3), the sedation modes conscious sedation and general anesthesia were not associated with significant differences in the predictive value of collateral status regarding infarction size or functional outcome. CONCLUSIONS The sedation mode, conscious sedation or general anesthesia, did not influence the predictive value of collaterals in patients with large-vessel occlusion anterior circulation stroke undergoing thrombectomy in the SIESTA trial.","Schönenberger, S; Pfaff, J; Uhlmann, L; Klose, C; Nagel, S; Ringleb, P A; Hacke, W; Kieser, M; Bendszus, M; Möhlenbruch, M A; Bösel, J",AJNR.

64112,Prejudice Plus Power = Racism.,2020-08-01,"PURPOSE To synthesize existing evidence on the unmet supportive care needs of people affected by kidney cancer, across the cancer care continuum. METHODS A systematic review was conducted according to the PRISMA Statement Guidelines. Electronic databases (CINAHL, MEDLINE, and PsychINFO) were searched using key search terms. Articles were assessed according to pre-specified eligibility criteria. Data extraction and quality appraisal were conducted. The findings were integrated in a narrative synthesis. RESULTS One thousand sixty-three publications were screened, and 18 publications met the inclusion criteria. The following domains of unmet needs in order of frequency included psychological/emotional needs (17/18: 94%), physical needs (10/18: 56%), social needs (4/18: 22%), interpersonal/intimacy needs (4/18: 22%), patient-clinician communication needs (3/18: 17%), family-related needs (3/18: 17%), health system/information needs (3/18: 17%), spiritual needs (3/18: 17%), daily living needs (2/18: 11%), practical needs (1/18: 6%), and cognitive needs (1/18: 6%). CONCLUSIONS There was a wide range of unmet supportive care needs experienced by people diagnosed with kidney cancer. A prominent focus was on psychological and physical needs. Further research is needed to understand how clinical (stage/treatment) and demographic (age/socio-economic/ethnicity) variables may moderate or mediate the relationship with unmet needs over time. With many unmet needs identified, this review provides a starting place to inform future work to address the complex unmet supportive care needs of people affected by kidney cancer.

65710,Should Jean be given the money?: A Twitter Poll exploration of consent and patient-centred care.,2021,"BACKGROUND Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has high morbidity and mortality rates. COPD impairs body functioning, reduces quality of life, and creates a great economic burden for society. Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) has become an important nonpharmacological treatment for COPD. This paper systematically reviews economic evaluations of PR in COPD patients in different settings. OBJECTIVES We aimed to understand the cost-effectiveness of PR in different settings for COPD to provide economic evidence for decision-makers. METHODS We searched eight databases from their inception to 23 November 2019. The results were presented in terms of an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), and the decision uncertainty was expressed by cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (CEACs). We used the Consensus on Health Economic Criteria to assess study quality. RESULTS This review included ten studies that matched the selection criteria. Five studies compared PR with usual care in primary healthcare or outpatient departments. Two studies compared community-based PR with hospital PR or usual care. In the other studies, PR was mainly carried out at home. Compared with usual care, PR was cost-effective in primary healthcare institutions or outpatient departments. According to CEACs, community-based PR had a 50% probability of cost-effectiveness at £30,000/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) compared with hospital PR in the UK. Based on the ICER, community-based PR was ""moderately"" cost-effective, with a ratio of €32,425/QALY compared with usual care in the Netherlands. Home-based PR was dominant compared with usual care, and tele-rehabilitation was dominant compared with traditional home PR. CONCLUSIONS PR conducted in different settings can potentially be cost-effective, as measured using QALY or the Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire (CRQ).","Liu, Shengnan; Zhao, Qiheng; Li, Wenshuo; Zhao, Xuetong; Li, Kun",Applied health economics and health policy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40258-020-00613-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33079374/,518

66716,Pathology-based validation of FDG PET segmentation tools for volume assessment of lymph node metastases from head and neck cancer.,2013,"OBJECT Prompt diagnosis of shunt malfunction is critical in preventing neurological morbidity and death in individuals with hydrocephalus; however, diagnostic methods for this condition remain limited. For several decades, investigators have sought a long-term, implantable intracranial pressure (ICP) monitor to assist in the diagnosis of shunt malfunction, but efforts have been impeded by device complexity, marked measurement drift, and limited instrumentation lifespan. In the current report, the authors introduce an entirely novel, simple, compressible gas design that addresses each of these problems. METHODS The device described herein, termed the ""baric probe,"" consists of a subdural fluid bladder and multichannel indicator that monitors the position of an air-fluid interface (AFI). A handheld ultrasound probe is used to interrogate the baric probe in vivo, permitting noninvasive ICP determination. To assess the function of device prototypes, ex vivo experiments were conducted using a water column, and short- and long-term in vivo experiments were performed using a porcine model with concurrent measurements of ICP via a fiberoptic monitor. RESULTS Following a toe region of approximately 2 cm H(2)O, the baric probe's AFI demonstrated a predictable linear relationship to ICP in both ex vivo and in vivo models. After a 2-week implantation of the device, this linear relationship remained robust and reproducible. Further, changes in ICP were observed with the baric probe, on average, 3 seconds in advance of the fiberoptic ICP monitor reading. CONCLUSIONS The authors demonstrate ""proof-of-concept"" and feasibility for the baric probe, a long-term implantable ICP monitor designed to facilitate the prompt and accurate diagnosis of shunt malfunction. The baric probe showed a consistent linear relationship between ICP and the device's AFI in ex vivo and short- and long-term in vivo models. With a low per-unit cost, a reduced need for radiography or CT, and an indicator that can be read with a handheld ultrasound probe that interfaces with any smart phone, the baric probe promises to simplify the care of patients with shunt-treated hydrocephalus throughout both the developed and the developing world.","Limbrick, David D; Lake, Stephen; Talcott, Michael; Alexander, Benjamin; Wight, Samuel; Willie, Jon T; Richard, William D; Genin, Guy M; Leuthardt, Eric C",Journal of neurosurgery.

In addition to viral detection, detection of tumors, glucose levels, and microbes is necessary for improved disease treatment and prevention. Bionanoparticles, such as extracellular vesicles and protein nanoparticles, are ideal platforms for biosensing and bioimaging applications because of their propensity for high density surface functionalization and large loading capacity. Scaffolding large numbers of sensing modules and detection modules onto bionanoparticles allows for enhanced analyte affinity and specificity as well as signal amplification for highly sensitive detection even at low analyte concentrations. Here we demonstrate the potential of bionanoparticles for bioimaging and biosensing by highlighting recent examples in literature that utilize protein nanoparticles and extracellular vesicles to generate highly sensitive detection devices with impressive signal amplification.","Yur, Daniel; Lieser, Rachel M; Sullivan, Millicent O; Chen, Wilfred",Current opinion in biotechnology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.copbio.2021.06.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34157601/,518
68804,Safe practice ventilation technique in lung scanning for pulmonary embolism.,2020-09-15,"The economics of affinity-tagging technologies, particularly at preparative scales, depends in part on the cost and efficiency of the bioprocessing step used to remove the affinity tag and obtain the final purified product (Lowe et al., J Biochem Biophys Methods. 2001;49:561-574). When CBM9, the family 9 cellulose binding module from Thermotoga maritima, serves as the affinity tag, the overall efficiency of tag removal is a function of the choice of processing enzyme and the local structure of the cleavage site, most notably the linker sequence flanking the bioprocessing recognition site on the tag side. A novel spectroscopic method is reported and used to rapidly and accurately measure CBM9 fusion-tag bioprocessing kinetics and their dependence on the choice of linker sequence. The assay monitors energy transfer between a lanthanide-based donor bound to the CBM9 tag and an acceptor fluorophore presented on the target protein or peptide. Enzyme-catalyzed cleavage of the fusion tag terminates this resonance energy transfer, resulting in a change in fluorescence intensity that can be monitored to quantify substrate concentration over time. The assay is simple, fast and accurate, providing k(cat)/K(M) values that contain standard errors of less than 3%. As a result, both substantial and subtle differences in bioprocessing kinetics can be measured and used to guide bioproduct design.","Kavoosi, Mojgan; Creagh, A Louise; Turner, Robin F B; Kilburn, Douglas G; Haynes, Charles A",Biotechnology progress,https://doi.org/10.1002/btpr.88; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19496182/,518
71784,18F-FDG PET/CT for diagnosing infectious complications in patients with severe neutropenia after intensive chemotherapy for haematological malignancy or stem cell transplantation.,2012,"BACKGROUND Outdoor play, sedentary behavior (SB), and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) are related to youth's health, however, there are research gaps regarding 1) associations between outdoor play, SB, and MVPA across a broad pediatric age range (6-17 years), and 2) longitudinal associations between outdoor play, SB, and MVPA across childhood and adolescence. Two studies were conducted to address those research gaps: Study 1 aimed to investigate relationships between outdoor play and accelerometer-assessed SB and MVPA in a cross-sectional nationwide sample of children and adolescents in Germany. Study 2 aimed to investigate prospective associations between outdoor play and self-reported screen-time SB and MVPA and in a sample of children with three measurement timepoints across 11 years. METHODS Data were obtained of the German national representative Motorik-Modul (MoMo) Study and the German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents (KiGGS). In Study 1, N = 2278 participants (6-17 years) were included with self-reported outdoor play and accelerometer-assessed SB and MVPA. Associations were examined via multiple linear regressions. In Study 2, N = 570 participants (baseline: 4-7 years) were included in the longitudinal analysis with follow-ups six and 11 years later. Screen-time SB (TV watching and PC/Gaming), MVPA, and outdoor play were self-reported. Associations were investigated through a path prediction model. RESULTS Study 1 showed that compared to <1 h outdoor play, higher engagement in daily outdoor play was related to lower SB (1-2 h: - 9.75 min/day, P = 0.017; ≥2 h: - 17.78 min/day, P < 0.001) and higher MVPA (≥2 h: + 3.87 min/day, P = 0.001). The cross-sectional relationship between MVPA and outdoor play was moderated by sex (in favor of males) and age (in favor of younger children). Study 2 showed that outdoor play in early childhood negatively predicted PC use/Gaming in later childhood, but was unrelated to MVPA. CONCLUSION In Study 1, outdoor play was negatively related to SB cross-sectionally. In Study 2, outdoor play in early childhood was negatively related to PC and Gaming time in later childhood. Thus, providing outdoor play opportunities, especially during early childhood, has potential to prevent SB. Future research should investigate longitudinal relationships using device-based assessments for SB and MVPA.","Nigg, Carina; Niessner, Claudia; Nigg, Claudio R; Oriwol, Doris; Schmidt, Steffen C E; Woll, Alexander",BMC public health,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-11754-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34548057/,518

The economic implications of achieving FPE have not been assessed. OBJECTIVE To assess the economic impact of achieving complete or near complete reperfusion after the first pass. METHODS Post hoc analyses were conducted using ARISE II study data. The target population consisted of patients in whom mTICI 2c-3 was achieved, stratified into two groups: (1) mTICI 2c-3 achieved after the first pass (FPE group) or (2) after multiple passes (non-FPE group). Baseline characteristics, clinical outcomes, and healthcare resource use were compared between groups. Costs from peer-reviewed literature were applied to assess cost consequences from the perspectives of the United States (USA), France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden, and United Kingdom (UK). RESULTS Among patients who achieved mTICI 2c-3 (n=172), FPE was achieved in 53% (n=91). A higher proportion of patients in the FPE group reached good functional outcomes (90-day modified Rankin Scale score 0-2 80.46% vs 61.04%, p<0.01). The patients in the FPE group had a shorter mean length of stay (6.10 vs 9.48 days, p<0.01) and required only a single stent retriever, whereas 35% of patients in the non-FPE group required at least one additional device. Driven by improvement in clinical outcomes, the FPE group had lower procedural/hospitalization-related (24-33% reduction) and annual care (11-27% reduction) costs across all countries. CONCLUSIONS FPE resulted in improved clinical outcomes, translating into lower healthcare resource use and lower estimated costs.","Zaidat, Osama O; Ribo, Marc; Mattle, Heinrich Paul; Saver, Jeffrey L; Bozorgchami, Hormozd; Yoo, Albert J; Ehm, Alexandra; Kottenmeier, Emilie; Cameron, Heather L; Qadeer, Rana A; Andersson, Tommy",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2020-016930; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33443119/,518
74343,"As the profession soldiers on, all members hear the call to arms.",2020-05-01,"This paper aims to evoke an alternative viewpoint on surrogacy, moving beyond popular Western feminist beliefs on the practice, by introducing the history and current context of East Asian surrogacy. To elaborate a different cultural perspective on surrogacy, this paper first introduces the East Asian history of contract pregnancy systems, prior to the emergence of the American invention of 'modern' surrogacy practice. Then, it examines Japanese mass media portrayals of cross-border surrogacy in which white women have become 'convenient' entities. The results of the analysis show how Japanese culture has adopted a rhetoric about the use of white women as convenient surrogate mothers in the global commercial surrogacy market. An essential aspect of surrogacy is the premise that a woman's reproductive function should be accessible to others. Past discussions among feminists have neglected this important point. Moreover, they share the assumption that white surrogacy clients are exploiters, who take advantage of women of colour as surrogate mothers. The current situation in Asia flips this perspective-with white women regarded as easier targets for exploitation by wealthy people of colour. For Asian clients, Westerners can be easily regarded as 'others' whom they can use for their reproductive needs. In today's globalized era, the surrogacy industry is no longer for affluent Westerners only. Considering this change, it is crucial to discuss surrogacy issues by reconstructing feminist perspectives with a globalized view, to help protect women's bodies, regardless of nationality, ethnicity, skin colour, or religion.","Yanagihara, Yoshie",Bioethics,https://doi.org/10.1111/bioe.12758; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32488873/,518

76177,Different radiolabelling methods alter the pharmacokinetic and biodistribution properties of plasminogen activator inhibitor type 2 (PAI-2) forms.,2012,"γδ-T cells play an indispensable role in host defense against different viruses, including influenza A virus. However, whether these cells have cytotoxic activity against influenza virus-infected lung alveolar epithelial cells and subsequently contribute to virus clearance remains unknown. Using influenza virus-infected A549 cells, human lung alveolar epithelial cells, we investigated the cytotoxic activity of aminobisphosphonate pamidronate (PAM)-expanded human Vγ9Vδ2-T cells and their underlying mechanisms. We found that PAM could selectively activate and expand human Vγ9Vδ2-T cells. PAM-expanded human Vγ9Vδ2-T cells efficiently killed influenza virus-infected lung alveolar epithelial cells and inhibited virus replication. The cytotoxic activity of PAM-expanded Vγ9Vδ2-T cells was dependent on cell-to-cell contact and required NKG2D activation. Perforin-granzyme B, tumor-necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and Fas-Fas ligand (FasL) pathways were involved in their cytotoxicity. Our study suggests that targeting γδ-T cells by PAM can potentially offer an alternative option for the treatment of influenza virus.","Li, Hong; Xiang, Zheng; Feng, Ting; Li, Jinrong; Liu, Yinping; Fan, Yingying; Lu, Qiao; Yin, Zhongwei; Yu, Meixing; Shen, Chongyang; Tu, Wenwei",Cellular & molecular immunology,https://doi.org/10.1038/cmi.2012.70; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23353835/,518

77237,Role of three-phase bone scintigraphy in paediatric osteoid osteoma eligible for radiofrequency ablation.,2013,"Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is commonly used in the treatment of malaria and rheumatic diseases. Recently it has also been identified as possible therapeutic option in combating COVID-19. However, the use of HCQ is known to induce cytotoxicity. In 2020, we developed a Multiscale Absorption and Transit (MAT) toolkit to simulate the dissolution, transport, absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination of orally administered drugs in the human GIT at multiple levels. MAT was constructed by integrating the spatially accurate first-principles driven high-fidelity drug transport, dissolution, and absorption model in the human stomach and GIT using the recently published Quasi-3D framework. The computational results showed that MAT was able to match the experimental concentration results better than the traditional compartmental models. In this study, we adapted MAT, to predict the pharmacokinetics of orally delivered HCQ in healthy subjects. The computational results matched the experimental concentration results. The simulated stomach and intestinal fluid and enterocyte concentrations were compared with the in-vitro CC50 values. While the peak enterocyte concentrations were several orders lower than the in-vitro CC50 values, the peak stomach and the intestinal fluid concentrations were only one order smaller than the in-vitro CC50 values. In particular, the peak stomach and the duodenum fluid concentrations were just 3X smaller than the in-vitro CC50 values. This implies that the lumen walls are much more susceptible to cytotoxicity-based damage than the enterocyte layers. We envision that MAT can be used to optimize the dosing regimen of HCQ by maximizing its bioavailability, while simultaneously minimizing the cytotoxic damage. This article is protected by copyright.

These strains represent two V. longisporum lineages derived from different hybridization events of haploid parental Verticillium strains. Vl32 and Vl43 carry same-sex mating-type genes derived from both parental lineages. Vl32 and Vl43 similarly colonize and penetrate plant roots, but asymptomatic Vl32 proliferation in planta is lower than virulent Vl43. The highly conserved Vl43 and Vl32 genomes include less than 1% unique genes, and the karyotypes of 15 or 16 chromosomes display changed genetic synteny due to substantial genomic reshuffling. A 20 kb Vl43 lineage-specific (LS) region apparently originating from the Verticillium dahliae-related ancestor is specific for symptomatic Vl43 and encodes seven genes, including two putative transcription factors. Either partial or complete deletion of this LS region in Vl43 did not reduce virulence but led to induction of even more severe disease symptoms in rapeseed. This suggests that the LS insertion in the genome of symptomatic V. longisporum Vl43 mediates virulence-reducing functions, limits damage on the host plant, and therefore tames Vl43 from being even more virulent.","Harting, Rebekka; Starke, Jessica; Kusch, Harald; Pöggeler, Stefanie; Maurus, Isabel; Schlüter, Rabea; Landesfeind, Manuel; Bulla, Ingo; Nowrousian, Minou; de Jonge, Ronnie; Stahlhut, Gertrud; Hoff, Katharina J; Aßhauer, Kathrin P; Thürmer, Andrea; Stanke, Mario; Daniel, Rolf; Morgenstern, Burkhard; Thomma, Bart P H J; Kronstad, James W; Braus-Stromeyer, Susanna A; Braus, Gerhard H",Molecular plant pathology,https://doi.org/10.1111/mpp.13071; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33955130/,518

Array tomography permits the quantitative analysis of single synapses but has limited sensitivity, and its application to functionally characterized synapses is challenging. Here, we aim to overcome these limitations by searching the parameter space of different fixation, resin, embedding, etching, retrieval, and elution conditions. Our optimizations reveal that etching epoxy-resin-embedded ultrathin sections with Na-ethanolate and treating them with SDS dramatically increase the labeling efficiency of synaptic proteins. We also demonstrate that this method is ideal for the molecular characterization of individual synapses following paired recordings, two-photon [Ca2+] or glutamate-sensor (iGluSnFR) imaging. This method fills a missing gap in the toolbox of molecular and cellular neuroscience, helping us to reveal how molecular heterogeneity leads to diversity in function.","Holderith, Noemi; Heredi, Judit; Kis, Viktor; Nusser, Zoltan",Cell reports,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2020.107968; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32726631/,518
80216,Forward View Retrospective.,2021-04-01,"BACKGROUND/AIM Coronavirus disease is spreading worldwide. Due to fast transmission and high fatality rate drastic emergency restrictions were issued. During the lockdown, only urgent medical services are guaranteed. All non-urgent services, as breast cancer (BC) screening, are temporarily suspended. The potential of breast cancer screening programs in increasing the survival rate and decreasing the mortality rate has been widely confirmed. Suspension could lead to worse outcomes for breast cancer patients. Our study aimed to analyse the data and provide estimates regarding the temporary BC screening suspension. PATIENTS AND METHODS Data regarding breast cancer and respective screening programs were achieved through literature research and analysis. RESULTS Considering three different scenarios with respect to the lockdown's impact on breast cancer screening, we estimate that approximately 10,000 patients could have a missed diagnosis during these 3 months. Considering a 6-month period, as suggested by the Imperial college model, the number of patients who will not receive a diagnosis will rise to 16,000. CONCLUSION Breast cancer screening should be resumed as soon as possible in order to avoid further breast cancer missed diagnosis and reduce the impact of delayed diagnosis.","Vanni, Gianluca; Pellicciaro, Marco; Materazzo, Marco; Bruno, Valentina; Oldani, Chiara; Pistolese, Chiara Adriana; Buonomo, Chiara; Caspi, Jonathan; Gualtieri, Paola; Chiaravalloti, Agostino; Palombi, Leonardo; Piccione, Emilio; Buonomo, Oreste Claudio",In vivo,https://doi.org/10.21873/invivo.12139; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32871851/,518

METHODS Men with localized high-grade PCa (n=256, Gleason 8-10, International Society of Urological Pathology [ISUP] grades 4 or 5) were imaged with bone scintigraphy and 18F-FDGPET/CT. We compared on a per-patient basis the accuracy of the two imaging modalities, taking intermodality agreement as the standard of truth (SOT). RESULTS 18F-FDG-PET/CT detected at least one bone metastasis in 33 patients compared to only 26 with bone scan. Of the seven false-negative bone scintigraphies, four (57.1%) were solitary metastases (monometastatic), three (42.9%) were oligometastatic (2-4 lesions), and none were plurimetastatic (>4 lesions). Compared to SOT, 18F-FDG-PET/CT showed higher sensitivity and accuracy than bone scintigraphy (100% vs. 78.8%, and 98.7% vs. 98.2%) for the detection of skeletal lesions. CONCLUSIONS 18F-FDG-PET/CT appears similar or better than conventional bone scans to assess for bone metastases in patients newly diagnosed with high-grade PCa. Since intraprostatic FDG-uptake is also a biomarker of failure to radical prostatectomy and that FDG-PET/CT has been shown to be accurate in detecting PCa lymph node metastasis, FDG-PET/CT has the potential to be used as the sole preoperative staging modality in high-grade PCa.","Otis-Chapados, Samuel; Goulet, Cassandra Ringuette; Dubois, Gabriel; Lavallée, Étienne; Dujardin, Thierry; Fradet, Yves; Lacombe, Louis; Lodde, Michele; Tiguert, Rabi; Toren, Paul; Fradet, Vincent; Beauregard, Jean-Mathieu; Buteau, François-Alexandre; Pouliot, Frédéric",Canadian Urological Association journal = Journal de l'Association des urologues du Canada,https://doi.org/10.5489/cuaj.7107; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33750523/,518

MATERIALS AND METHODS Fifty patients who underwent FDG PET-CT for assessment of a SPN were identified. Seven reporters with varied experience at four centres graded FDG uptake visually using the British Thoracic Society (BTS) four-point scale. Five reporters also scored SPNs according to three- and five-point visual assessment scales and using semi-quantitative assessment (maximum standardised uptake value [SUVmax]). Interobserver reliability was assessed with the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) and weighted Cohen's kappa (κ). Diagnostic performance was evaluated by receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis. RESULTS Good interobserver reliability was demonstrated with the BTS scale (ICC=0.78, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.69-0.85) and five-point scale (ICC=0.78, 95 CI 0.68-0.86), whilst the three-point scale demonstrated moderate reliability (ICC=0.70, 95% CI: 0.59-0.80). Almost perfect agreement was achieved between two consultants (κ=0.85), and substantial agreement between two other consultants (κ=0.78) using the BTS scale. ROC curves for the BTS and five-point scales demonstrated equivalent accuracy (BTS area under the ROC curve [AUC]=0.768; five-point AUC=0.768). SUVmax was no more accurate compared to the BTS scale (SUVmax AUC=0.794; BTS AUC=0.768, p=0.43). CONCLUSIONS The BTS scale can be applied reliably by reporters with varied levels of PET-CT reporting experience, across different centres and has a diagnostic performance that is not surpassed by alternative scales.","Fatania, K; Brown, P J; Xie, C; McDermott, G; Callister, M E J; Graham, R; Subesinghe, M; Gleeson, F V; Scarsbrook, A F",Clinical radiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.crad.2020.06.028; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32709393/,518

86933,FDA Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs): What are they and what do they mean for the H1N1 swine flu response?,2009,"BACKGROUND Pressure ulcers, also known as bedsores, decubitus ulcers and pressure injuries, are localised areas of injury to the skin or the underlying tissue, or both. Dressings are widely used to treat pressure ulcers and promote healing, and there are many options to choose from including alginate, hydrocolloid and protease-modulating dressings. Topical agents have also been used as alternatives to dressings in order to promote healing.A clear and current overview of all the evidence is required to facilitate decision-making regarding the use of dressings or topical agents for the treatment of pressure ulcers. Such a review would ideally help people with pressure ulcers and health professionals assess the best treatment options. This review is a network meta-analysis (NMA) which assesses the probability of complete ulcer healing associated with alternative dressings and topical agents. OBJECTIVES To assess the effects of dressings and topical agents for healing pressure ulcers in any care setting. We aimed to examine this evidence base as a whole, determining probabilities that each treatment is the best, with full assessment of uncertainty and evidence quality. SEARCH METHODS In July 2016 we searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations); Ovid Embase and EBSCO CINAHL Plus. We also searched clinical trials registries for ongoing and unpublished studies, and scanned reference lists of relevant included studies as well as reviews, meta-analyses, guidelines and health technology reports to identify additional studies. There were no restrictions with respect to language, date of publication or study setting. SELECTION CRITERIA Published or unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the effects of at least one of the following interventions with any other intervention in the treatment of pressure ulcers (Stage 2 or above): any dressing, or any topical agent applied directly to an open pressure ulcer and left in situ. We excluded from this review dressings attached to external devices such as negative pressure wound therapies, skin grafts, growth factor treatments, platelet gels and larval therapy. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently performed study selection, risk of bias assessment and data extraction. We conducted network meta-analysis using frequentist mega-regression methods for the efficacy outcome, probability of complete healing. We modelled the relative effectiveness of any two treatments as a function of each treatment relative to the reference treatment (saline gauze). We assumed that treatment effects were similar within dressings classes (e.g. hydrocolloid, foam). We present estimates of effect with their 95% confidence intervals for individual treatments compared with every other, and we report ranking probabilities for each intervention (probability of being the best, second best, etc treatment). We assessed the certainty (quality) of the body of evidence using GRADE for each network comparison and for the network as whole. MAIN RESULTS We included 51 studies (2947 participants) in this review and carried out NMA in a network of linked interventions for the sole outcome of probability of complete healing. The network included 21 different interventions (13 dressings, 6 topical agents and 2 supplementary linking interventions) and was informed by 39 studies in 2127 participants, of whom 783 had completely healed wounds.We judged the network to be sparse: overall, there were relatively few participants, with few events, both for the number of interventions and the number of mixed treatment contrasts; most studies were small or very small. The consequence of this sparseness is high imprecision in the evidence, and this, coupled with the (mainly) high risk of bias in the studies informing the network, means that we judged the vast majority of the evidence to be of low or very low certainty. We have no confidence in the findings regarding the rank order of interventions in this review (very low-certainty evidence), but we report here a summary of results for some comparisons of interventions compared with saline gauze. We present here only the findings from evidence which we did not consider to be very low certainty, but these reported results should still be interpreted in the context of the very low certainty of the network as a whole.It is not clear whether regimens involving protease-modulating dressings increase the probability of pressure ulcer healing compared with saline gauze (risk ratio (RR) 1.65, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.92 to 2.94) (moderate-certainty evidence: low risk of bias, downgraded for imprecision). This risk ratio of 1.65 corresponds to an absolute difference of 102 more people healed with protease modulating dressings per 1000 people treated than with saline gauze alone (95% CI 13 fewer to 302 more). It is unclear whether the following interventions increase the probability of healing compared with saline gauze (low-certainty evidence): collagenase ointment (RR 2.12, 95% CI 1.06 to 4.22); foam dressings (RR 1.52, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.26); basic wound contact dressings (RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.65 to 2.58) and polyvinylpyrrolidone plus zinc oxide (RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.37 to 4.62); the latter two interventions both had confidence intervals consistent with both a clinically important benefit and a clinically important harm, and the former two interventions each had high risk of bias as well as imprecision. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS A network meta-analysis (NMA) of data from 39 studies (evaluating 21 dressings and topical agents for pressure ulcers) is sparse and the evidence is of low or very low certainty (due mainly to risk of bias and imprecision). Consequently we are unable to determine which dressings or topical agents are the most likely to heal pressure ulcers, and it is generally unclear whether the treatments examined are more effective than saline gauze.More research is needed to determine whether particular dressings or topical agents improve the probability of healing of pressure ulcers. The NMA is uninformative regarding which interventions might best be included in a large trial, and it may be that research is directed towards prevention, leaving clinicians to decide which treatment to use on the basis of wound symptoms, clinical experience, patient preference and cost.","Westby, Maggie J; Dumville, Jo C; Soares, Marta O; Stubbs, Nikki; Norman, Gill",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd011947.pub2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28639707/,518

DESIGN This was a retrospective cohort study of a referral center for COVID-19. We included all consecutive patients admitted to the hospital between February 26 and May 15, 2020 with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. SMI was assessed from a transverse computed tomography image at the level of T12 with NIH ImageJ software, statistical analysis was done to find an association between SMI and in-hospital mortality, need of IMV, and ICU admission. RESULTS We included 519 patients, median age was 51 (42-61) years, 115 patients (22%) had low SMI. On multivariable analysis, SMI was not associated with mortality, ICU admission or IMV need, nor in a sub analysis of patients > 65 years.

101596,Initial Evaluation of (99m)Tc(CO)3(ASMA) as a Renal Tracer in Healthy Human Volunteers.,2014,"INTRODUCTION At the end of April 2020, three European pediatric societies published an alert on a new hyperinflammatory disorder linked to SARS-CoV-2. This disease has alternatively been called Kawasaki-like disease, pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection (PIMS-TS), and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). These alerts provide a clear starting point from which to study the early response of the medical and scientific community to a new disease in terms of scientific publications, and to compare the timeline of this response with levels of general public interest. To this aim, we conducted a bibliometric analysis of articles on this disease published between 1 April and 5 July 2020. METHOD A literature search was performed using PubMed and in three preprint repositories. For each article, the name used for the disease in the title, the number of authors, the number of patients, the citations according to Google Scholar, the journal impact factor, and the Altmetric score were retrieved. Google search trends for the terms ""Kawasaki"" and ""COVID,"" ""COVID-19,"" and ""coronavirus"" were also retrieved, as was the number of Reuters news articles published on the topic. These data were compared longitudinally on a weekly basis. The quality of the reporting of the study was evaluated using the STROBE guidelines for observational studies with more than three patients and using the CARE guidelines for case reports of three or fewer patients. RESULTS Eighty-six articles were included, among which ten were preprints (three of which were subsequently published) and 49 were clinical articles (57%). A total of 857 patients were described. The median number of authors per article was five (range, 1-45), the median number of patients was four (1-186), the median number of citations was one (0-170), the median Altmetric score was 12 (0-7242), and the median journal impact factor was 3.7 (1-74.7). For the clinical articles, the median percentage of STROBE or CARE checklist items satisfied was 70% (IQR, 56.75-79.25; range, 40-90). Guideline adherence was significantly higher for observational studies than for case reports (median percentage of checklist items satisfied, 78.5% vs 61.5%; P<0.001); however, guideline adherence did not differ significantly between peer-reviewed and preprint articles (median percentage of checklist items satisfied, 57% vs 72%; P=0.205). The only statistically significant difference between clinical articles and other types of articles was the number of authors (median, 7 vs 2; P=2.53E-9). Fifty-seven of the 86 articles were authored by researchers from just three countries (the USA, 31; France, 14; and the UK, 12). The names most frequently used in the title were Kawasaki-like disease (n=37), followed by MIS-C (n=27), PIM-TS (n=14), and other names involving the term ""inflammatory"" (n=12). Google searches for related terms peaked between weeks 18 and 21, following the initial alerts and decreased rapidly thereafter. The number of Reuters articles on the subject was correlated with Google search trends (ρ: 0.86, 95% CI [0.59; 0.96]; P=0.00016), but the number of medical articles published was not (ρ: -0.54, 95% CI [-0.87; 0.14]; P=0.11). The first small case series was published less than 2 weeks after the initial alert; however, if all articles had been deposited as preprints when they were submitted to journals, the cumulative number of reported cases would have been 300% higher in week 18 (3 vs 1), 400% higher in week 19 (44 vs 11), 70% higher in week 20 (124 vs 73), and 54% higher in week 21 (129 vs 84). CONCLUSION In a period of 9 weeks after the initial alerts from European pediatric societies, 85 medical articles were published, involving 856 patients (one case report was published before the alerts), allowing rapid dissemination of research information. However, general public interest followed the news cycle rather than scientific releases. The quality of the reporting, as assessed by adherence to STROBE or CARE guidelines, was adequate with more than two-thirds of checklist items satisfied. Learned societies play an important role in the early dissemination of up-to-date peer-reviewed information. Preprint deposition should be encouraged to accelerate the dissemination of research information.","Morand, A; Urbina, D; Giovannini-Chami, L; Fabre, A",Archives de pediatrie : organe officiel de la Societe francaise de pediatrie,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arcped.2021.05.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34140220/,518

The Story of Smallpox: Lessons from a Previous Pandemic.,2020-10-01,"Pro-inflammatory activation of adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) is causally linked to obesity and obesity-associated disorders. A number of studies have demonstrated the crucial role of mitochondrial metabolism in macrophage activation. However, there is a lack of pharmaceutical agents to target the mitochondrial metabolism of ATMs for the treatment of obesity-related diseases. Here, we characterize a near-infrared fluorophore (IR-61) that preferentially accumulates in the mitochondria of ATMs and has a therapeutic effect on diet-induced obesity as well as obesity-associated insulin resistance and fatty liver. IR-61 inhibits the classical activation of ATMs by increasing mitochondrial complex levels and oxidative phosphorylation via the ROS/Akt/Acly pathway. Taken together, our findings indicate that specific enhancement of ATMs oxidative phosphorylation improves chronic inflammation and obesity-related disorders. IR-61 might be an anti-inflammatory agent useful for the treatment of obesity-related diseases by targeting the mitochondria of ATMs.","Wang, Yawei; Tang, Binlin; Long, Lei; Luo, Peng; Xiang, Wei; Li, Xueru; Wang, Huilan; Jiang, Qingzhi; Tan, Xu; Luo, Shenglin; Li, Huijuan; Wang, Ziwen; Chen, Zelin; Leng, Yu; Jiang, Zhongyong; Wang, Yang; Ma, Le; Wang, Rui; Zeng, Chunyu; Liu, Zujuan; Wang, Yu; Miao, Hongming; Shi, Chunmeng",Nature communications,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-20315-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33397994/,518

103082,Diagnostic evaluation of pulmonary embolism during the COVID-19 pandemic.,2020-04-01,"OBJECTIVE(S) Obstetric Violence refers to professional deficiencies in maternity care, which can occur in both low and high resource settings. Examples include non-dignified care, lack of respect when giving care, discrimination and abandonment of care. The objective of this study was to assess knowledge and attitudes towards obstetric violence in a cohort of medical students in India and the UK. STUDY DESIGN An online survey was sent to 240 UK and 280 Indian medical students. This incorporated a video showing a dramatized scenario of obstetric violence. The survey assessed participant's demographics and prior knowledge of obstetric violence. Participants scored their perceptions of eight behaviours in the video on visual analogue scales. Participants were asked to reflect on their own practice and score this. Comparisons of survey responses between UK and Indian participants were made using chi squared/Student's t-test. RESULTS 62 Indian medical students and 58 UK medical students completed the survey. Indian medical students were significantly more likely to be male (p < 0.001). 26 % of UK participants had previously heard the term obstetric violence, compared to 34 % of Indian participants (p = 0.15). Both were able to correctly define obstetric violence at similar rates (32 % versus 34 %). Indian medical students were significantly less critical (p < 0.001) of all eight scored behaviours in the video of obstetric violence compared to their UK counterparts. UK medical students were significantly less likely to agree that the video had changed their perception on how teams should behave and act in this context (p < 0.001). 90 % of UK participants and 38 % of Indian participants had received training in professional behaviours. 14 % of UK participants had seen examples of obstetric violence in clinical practice compared to 49 % of Indian participants. CONCLUSIONS UK and Indian medical students were able to identify behaviours associated with obstetric violence, although the majority were previously unaware of the term. Indian medical students in this study were less critical of obstetric violence in the video, which may be because of cultural reasons, greater numbers of male students, greater exposure to obstetric violence or less training on professional behaviours. Standardised training to prevent obstetric violence should be part of undergraduate medical training internationally.","Gray, Thomas; Mohan, Suruchi; Lindow, Stephen; Pandey, Uma; Farrell, Tom","European journal of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive biology",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejogrb.2021.04.013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33932685/,518

The degree of ecological sensitivity varies in spatial dimension depending on the natural and cultural features. Ecological sensitivity analysis is based on basis of mapping these differences. As a result of the analysis, an important data that can be a base for spatial plans at different scales is provided. In accordance with this aim, Denizli province was selected for the study area in this research. The factors affecting sensitivity were determined by the literature survey, which was conducted by considering the characteristics of the study area. In this context, elevation, slope, aspect, the proximity to water surface, land cover, and vegetation coverage were evaluated as natural factors, and the proximity to primary traffic roads and residential areas as cultural factors. Each factor was spatially grouped by means of geographic information systems (GIS) according to the degree of impact on ecological sensitivity. Scale 1 (lowest ecological sensitivity) to 5 (highest ecological sensitivity) was used for the spatial grouping. A analytical hierarchy process (AHP) was applied to weight the factors. The overlay method was used in line with the weighted scores in order to determine the composite ecological sensitivity. As a result of the study, the area of 286.26 sq km (2.37%) as highly and more sensitive, 5267.47 sq km (43.50%) as moderately sensitive, and 6554.56 sq km (54.13%) as mildly and less sensitive was determined.

110354,"Melatonin and cocaine: role of mitochondria, immunity, and gut microbiome.",2020-04-03,"Enveloped viruses utilize fusion (F) proteins studding the surface of the virus to facilitate membrane fusion with a target cell membrane. Fusion of the viral envelope with a cellular membrane is required for release of viral genomic material, so the virus can ultimately reproduce and spread. To drive fusion, the F protein undergoes an irreversible conformational change, transitioning from a metastable pre-fusion conformation to a more thermodynamically stable post-fusion structure. Understanding the elements that control stability of the pre-fusion state and triggering to the post-fusion conformation is important for understanding F protein function. Mutations in F protein transmembrane (TM) domains implicated the TM domain in the fusion process, but the structural and molecular details in fusion remain unclear. Previously, analytical ultracentrifugation was utilized to demonstrate that isolated TM domains of Hendra virus F protein associate in a monomer-trimer equilibrium (Smith, E. C., Smith, S. E., Carter, J. R., Webb, S. R., Gibson, K. M., Hellman, L. M., Fried, M. G., and Dutch, R. E. (2013) J. Biol. Chem. 288, 35726-35735). To determine factors driving this association, 140 paramyxovirus F protein TM domain sequences were analyzed. A heptad repeat of β-branched residues was found, and analysis of the Hendra virus F TM domain revealed a heptad repeat leucine-isoleucine zipper motif (LIZ). Replacement of the LIZ with alanine resulted in dramatically reduced TM-TM association. Mutation of the LIZ in the whole protein resulted in decreased protein stability, including pre-fusion conformation stability. Together, our data suggest that the heptad repeat LIZ contributed to TM-TM association and is important for F protein function and pre-fusion stability.","Webb, Stacy; Nagy, Tamas; Moseley, Hunter; Fried, Michael; Dutch, Rebecca",The Journal of biological chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.m117.777235; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28213515/,518

RECENT FINDINGS Studies of central nervous system (CNS) tissue in brain model systems and from adults with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection have begun to uncover potential mechanisms for neurological damage during COVID-19. These studies suggest that direct viral invasion of the CNS occurs in a subset of cases but does not frequently cause overt viral meningoencephalitis. Vascular abnormalities including microvascular thrombi and endothelial activation, as well as parainfectious processes, including CNS specific immune responses, may contribute to neurological symptoms during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. SUMMARY Neuroimmune perturbations and vascular inflammation observed in people with COVID-19 may warrant investigation of immune-modulating interventions to ameliorate neurological complications associated with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. These therapies may also impact the trajectory of potential long-term complications of COVID-19.","Farhadian, Shelli F; Seilhean, Danielle; Spudich, Serena",Current opinion in neurology,https://doi.org/10.1097/wco.0000000000000944; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33852526/,518
113883,A commentary on the Nigerian response to the COVID-19 pandemic.,2020-06-11,"BACKGROUND Single-site laparoscopic colectomy (SLC) is an emerging concept that, compared with conventional multiport laparoscopic colectomy (MLC), yields reduced postoperative pain and improved cosmesis. Complete mesocolic excision (CME) is a novel concept for colon cancer surgery that provides improved oncologic outcomes; however, there are no reports of SLC with CME. We conducted a prospective case-control study to evaluate the feasibility and safety of SLC with CME for colon cancer. METHODS Prospectively collected data of patients with stage I-III colon cancer who underwent SLC (n = 150) or MLC (n = 150) between June 2008 and March 2012 were analyzed. Patients who underwent SLC were, in terms of clinical characteristics and tumor location, matched as closely as possible with those undergoing MLC. Within each group, patients were classified as having right-sided (n = 69 in each group) or left-sided (n = 81 in each group) colon cancer, and short-term outcomes were compared between the two procedures overall and per side. RESULTS Overall perioperative outcomes, including operation time, blood loss, number of lymph nodes harvested, length of the resected specimen, and complications, were similar between the two procedures, whereas postoperative pain was significantly lower with SLC. Operation time for right-sided SLC was significantly shortened. SLC with CME was completed successfully in 94 % (65/69) of right-sided cases and in 88 % (71/81) of left-sided cases. Conversion rates were 1.4 % (1/69) and 1.1 % (1/81), respectively. The umbilical scars were nearly invisible 3 months after the procedure, and most patients reported being quite satisfied with the cosmetic outcomes. CONCLUSIONS SLC with CME for colon cancer is feasible when performed by experienced surgeons in selected patients. Excellent cosmesis and reduced postoperative pain as well as oncologic clearance can be expected. A large-scale, prospective, randomized, controlled trial should be conducted to confirm the superiority of this procedure over MLC with CME.","Takemasa, Ichiro; Uemura, Mamoru; Nishimura, Junichi; Mizushima, Tsunekazu; Yamamoto, Hirofumi; Ikeda, Masataka; Sekimoto, Mitsugu; Doki, Yuichiro; Mori, Masaki",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-013-3284-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24202709/,518

This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the novel serological biomarkers intestinal fatty acid-binding protein (I-FABP), α-glutathione S-transferase (α-GST), D-lactate, ischemia modified albumin (IMA), and citrulline to detect AMI. A systematic search of electronic databases was performed to identify all published diagnostic accuracy studies on I-FABP, α-GST, D-lactate, IMA, and citrulline. Articles were selected based on pre-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Risk of bias and applicability were assessed. Two-by-two contingency tables were constructed to calculate accuracy standards. Summary estimates were computed using random-effects models. The search yielded 1925 papers, 21 were included in the final analysis. Pooled sensitivity and specificity for investigated biomarkers were: I-FABP (Uden); 79.0 (95% CI 66.5-88.5) and 91.3 (87.0-94.6), I-FABP (Osaka); 75.0 (67.9-81.2) and 79.2 (76.2-82.0), D-lactate; 71.7 (58.6-82.5) and 74.2 (69.0-79.0), α-GST; 67.8 (54.2-79.5) and 84.2 (75.3-90.9), IMA; 94.7 (74.0-99.9) and 86.4 (65.1-97.1), respectively.

Risk factors for critical illness from SARS-CoV-2 infection include male gender, obesity, diabetes, and age >65. The mechanisms underlying the susceptibility to critical illness are poorly understood. Of interest, these comorbidities have previously been associated with increased signaling of Th17 cells. Th17 cells secrete IL-17A and are important for clearing extracellular pathogens, but inappropriate signaling has been linked to acute respiratory distress syndrome. Currently there are few treatment options for SARS-CoV-2 infections. This review describes evidence linking risk factors for critical illness in COVID-19 with increased Th17 cell activation and IL-17 signaling that may lead to increased likelihood for lung injury and respiratory failure. These findings provide a basis for testing the potential use of therapies directed at modulation of Th17 cells and IL-17A signaling in the treatment of COVID-19.","Orlov, Marika; Wander, Pandora L; Morrell, Eric D; Mikacenic, Carmen; Wurfel, Mark M",Journal of immunology,https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.2000554; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32651218/,518

To overcome the challenges facing conventional cancer therapies, newly developed methods are being investigated. Significant levels of specificity, remarkable accumulation at the tumor site, limited side effects, and minimal off-target effects enable the newly synthesized nanoparticles (NPs) to become the preferred drug delivery method in anticancer therapeutic approaches. According to the literature, CD73 has a pivotal role in cancer progression and resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Therefore, CD73 has attracted considerable attention among scientists to target this molecule. Accordingly, FDA approved CDK inhibitors such as Dinaciclib that blocks CDK1, 2, 5, and 9, and exhibits significant anticancer activity. So in this study, we intended to simultaneously suppress CD73 and CDKs in cancer cells by using the folic acid (FA)-conjugated chitosan-lactate (CL) NPs loaded with anti-CD73 siRNA and Dinaciclib to control tumor progression and metastasis. The results showed that NPs could effectively transfect cancer cells in a FA receptor-dependent manner leading to suppression of proliferation, survival, migration, and metastatic potential. Moreover, the treatment of tumor-bearing mice with this combination strategy robustly inhibited tumor growth and enhanced survival time in mice. These findings imply the high potential of FA-CL NPs loaded with anti-CD73 siRNA and Dinaciclib for use in cancer treatment shortly.","Hallaj, Shahin; Asl, Sima Heydarzadeh; Alian, Fatemeh; Farshid, Sajjad; Eshaghi, Farzaneh Sadat; Namdar, Afshin; Atyabi, Fatemeh; Masjedi, Ali; Hallaj, Tooba; Ghorbani, Anahita; Ghalamfarsa, Ghasem; Sojoodi, Mozhdeh; Jadidi-Niaragh, Farhad",Life sciences,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2020.118150; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32726663/,518

Thus far, this topic has received little systematic attention. AIM To summarise studies describing self-management strategies of patients with advanced cancer and associated experiences and personal characteristics. Also, to summarise attitudes of relatives and healthcare professionals towards patient self-management. DESIGN A systematic review including non-experimental quantitative and qualitative studies. Data were analysed using critical interpretive synthesis. Included studies were appraised on methodological quality and quality of reporting. DATA SOURCES MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Web of Science and Google Scholar (until 11 June 2019). RESULTS Of 1742 identified articles, 31 moderate-quality articles describing 8 quantitative and 23 qualitative studies were included. Patients with advanced cancer used self-management strategies in seven domains: medicine and pharmacology, lifestyle, mental health, social support, knowledge and information, navigation and coordination and medical decision-making (29 articles). Strategies were highly individual, sometimes ambivalent and dependent on social interactions. Older patients and patients with more depressive symptoms and lower levels of physical functioning, education and self-efficacy might have more difficulties with certain self-management strategies (six articles). Healthcare professionals perceived self-management as desirable and achievable if based on sufficient skills and knowledge and solid patient-professional partnerships (three articles). CONCLUSION Self-management of patients with advanced cancer is highly personal and multifaceted. Strategies may be substitutional, additional or even conflicting compared to care provided by healthcare professionals.

This case-control study aimed to (a) document the prevalence of disorders of gut-brain interaction (DGBI) in eating disorders, (b) examine the specific impact of disordered eating behaviors on the risk of DGBI, and (c) explore the impact of current eating disorder psychopathology on DGBI. METHOD We included 765 cases with eating disorders and 1,240 controls. DGBI were assessed via the ROME III questionnaire. Prevalences of DGBI were calculated across eating disorder diagnoses (anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and multiple eating disorders) and in controls. The association between disordered eating behaviors and DGBI was examined using logistic regression models. Lastly, we compared the total number of DGBI in individuals with high versus low current eating disorder symptoms. RESULTS A large majority (88.2-95.5%) of individuals with eating disorders reported at least one DGBI and 34.8-48.7% reported three or more DGBI. Of the DGBI categories, functional bowel disorders were the most commonly endorsed category, and of the individual DGBI, irritable bowel syndrome was the most frequently reported (43.9-58.8%).

However, an acute episode of MD has not been evaluated by using WBT yet. OBJECTIVE To investigate WBT findings in patients with MD during acute attacks. METHOD Thirty definite MD patients with unilateral acute low-tone sensorineural hearing loss and aural fullness, and thirty age- and sex-matched control subjects were enrolled prospectively in a tertiary referral center. Ears were divided into three groups as follows: (1) affected ears of MD patients, (2) contralateral ears of MD patients, (3) control ears. Individuals underwent WBT. The resonance frequency (RF), mean absorbance value, mean low- and high-frequency absorbance values (LF-A and HF-A), and double peak width at 2 kHz of conductance tympanometry (2-kHz PW) were assessed. RESULTS Seventy percent in group 1, 66.7% in group 2, and 78.3% in group 3 demonstrated double peaks at 2 kHz.

Final diagnosis was autoimmune-relatedepilepsy (confirmed + probable) in 22 cases and ASS secondary to autoimmune encephalitis (confirmed or probable) in 27, non-autoimmune aetiologies or other diagnosis in 49 (44 %), and unknown aetiology in 11 (10.2 %). Neuronal antibodies (ab) were found in 27 patients (24.7 %). T-lymphocyte infiltration in temporal lobes was observed in 2/8 patients (20 %). Neuronal ab were more frequent in the autoimmune groups: 17 patients (29.8 %) vs 1(2.3 %), p:0.001, and they suffered more autoimmune diseases: 37 (75.5 %) vs 12 (24.48 %), p:0.0001, and 34 (69 %) vs 22 (44.9 %) p:0.027, respectively. All patients with GAD ab 17/17 (100 %) evolved to chronic disease. Four patients (29 %) with ASS secondary to autoimmune encephalitis developed epilepsy. SIGNIFICANCE ASS secondary to autoimmune encephalitis or autoimmune-related epilepsy will be diagnosed in nearly half of patients who have been suspected of it. The only diagnostic clue is neuronal ab. Patients who have suffered ASS secondary to autoimmune encephalitis may develop epilepsy over time.","Falip, Mercè; Jaraba, Sònia; Rodríguez-Bel, Laura; Castañer, Sara; Mora, Jaume; Arroyo, Pablo; Miro, Júlia; Sala-Padró, Jacint; Martínez-Yélamos, Sergio; Casasnovas, Carlos; Gascon-Bayarri, Jordi; Real, Eva; Moranderia, Francisco; Vidal, Noemí; Veciana, Misericòrdia; Saiz, Albert; Carreño, Mar",Seizure,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.seizure.2020.07.019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32818871/,518

The study of the molecular phenomena that affect biological membranes has a great impact on the understanding of cellular physiology. To understand these phenomena, it has become increasingly necessary to develop simple synthetic models that allow the most basic details of such processes to be reproduced. In this short communication, we took advantage of the properties of two well-established lipid model systems, GUVs and SLBs, with compositions mimicking the cell membrane present in mammals and bacteria, to study the thermotropic phase behavior of lipids as well as the effect of daptomycin, a cyclic lipopeptide used as an antibiotic. The study of mechanical and thermodynamical properties of these model systems could contribute to establish a theoretical framework to develop more efficient strategies for biological control.","Balleza, Daniel; Mescola, Andrea; Alessandrini, Andrea",European biophysics journal : EBJ,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00249-020-01445-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32632743/,518

This systematic review investigates the literature concerning overall mortality and postoperative complications after cancer surgery with inhalational (INHA) and intravenous anesthesia (TIVA). A search was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines, including studies with patients undergoing surgery for cancer and where TIVA was compared with INHA. Two investigators identified relevant papers in the databases: PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library. Risks of bias assessment tools from the Cochrane Collaboration were used for evaluating quality of evidence. Eight studies with a total of 10,696 patients were included. Four studies reported data regarding overall mortality and four studies reported data regarding postoperative complications. Evidence was evaluated to be of moderate to serious risk of bias. Three retrospective studies presented a hazard ratio (HR) adjusting for several confounders. One study reported an increased overall mortality after INHA with a HR of 1.47 (95% CI 1.31-1.64, p≤0.001), while another study reported a tendency of decreased overall mortality after TIVA (HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.72-1.00, p=0.051). A third study showed no difference in the overall mortality, but prolonged recurrence-free survival after TIVA with a HR of 0.48 (95% CI 0.27-0.86, p=0.014). In one study, the rate of pulmonary complications was significantly higher after INHA compared with TIVA, while other postoperative complications were comparable. There are currently four propensity-adjusted retrospective studies indicating that TIVA might be the preferred anesthetic choice in cancer surgery. However, evidence is currently of low quality and randomized clinical trials are required for further investigation.","Soltanizadeh, Sinor; Degett, Thea H; Gögenur, Ismail",Journal of clinical anesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclinane.2017.08.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28797751/,518

OBJECTIVES We sought to summarize the studies published to date regarding the antiviral activity of zinc in COVID-19 patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS A meta-analysis was performed to compare the outcomes of hospitalized patients receiving zinc supplementation and those treated with standard care. The primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge. Secondary outcomes were in-hospital mortality and length of stay in hospital or intensive care unit (ICU). RESULTS Data relating to 1474 patients included in four studies were analyzed. Survival to hospital discharge was 56.8% in the zinc group, compared to 75.9% in the non-zinc group (P=0.88). In-hospital mortality was 22.3% in the zinc group, compared to 13.6% for the standard care group (P=0.16). Length of hospital stay was 7.7(3.7) days in the zinc group and 7.2(3.9) days in the standard treatment group (P<0.001). Length of ICU stay was 4.9(1.7) days in the zinc group and 5.8(1.9) days in the standard care group (P=0.009). CONCLUSIONS Zinc supplementation did not have any beneficial impact on the course of COVID-19 evaluated as survival to hospital discharge and in-hospital mortality. The zinc-supplemented group had longer hospital and ICU lengths of stay. There is at present no evidence-based data to support routine zinc supplementation in COVID-19 patients.","Szarpak, Lukasz; Pruc, Michal; Gasecka, Aleksandra; Jaguszewski, Milosz J; Michalski, Tomasz; Peacock, Frank W; Smereka, Jacek; Pytkowska, Katarzyna; Filipiak, Krzysztof J",Polish archives of internal medicine,https://doi.org/10.20452/pamw.16048; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34180610/,518

METHODS The University of Hong Kong (HKU), HKU-Shenzhen Hospital, and Shenzhen Health Capacity Building and Continuing Education Center invited PCPs from Hong Kong and Shenzhen to participate in an online survey. RESULTS The survey was completed by 151 PCPs and 258 PCPs from Hong Kong and Shenzhen, respectively. The majority agreed it was important to keep current with genetics (91%) and that personalized medicine was the future of healthcare (86%), yet only 10% reported that they had postgraduate training in genomic medicine. Seventeen percent of Hong Kong and 40% of Shenzhen's PCPs encountered genetic-related cases in the past 6 months, and they identified insufficient knowledge, few training opportunities, and self-rated low confidence in their skillsets as main barriers. CONCLUSIONS Our survey shows that Hong Kong and Shenzhen's PCPs are not yet fully utilizing potential benefits of genomic medicine in their clinical practice, which could be addressed with a combination of easily accessible educational resources, clear referral pathways and guidelines on genetic diseases, and cross-specialty collaboration between healthcare systems and professional bodies.","Yu, Man Wai Cecilia; Fung, Jasmine Lee Fong; Ng, Amy Pui Pui; Li, Zhuo; Lan, Wang; Chung, Claudia Ching Yan; Li, Yang; Liu, Ying; Chung, Brian H Y; Wong, William Chi Wai",Molecular genetics & genomic medicine,https://doi.org/10.1002/mgg3.1702; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34002545/,518

Methods: A continuous cohort of adults and adolescent (≥12 years) who screened COVID-19 was included in Xiangya Hospital of Central South University from January 23 to February 3, 2020 in which cases were divided the test library and the verification library. Their gender, age, onset time were recorded. Take epidemiological history, fever, and the blood lymphocytes decline as clinical indicators, used CT to evaluate the possibility of COVID-19 and range of lung involvement. According to the current national standards, throat swabs of suspected cases were collected and the nucleic acid of COVID-19 was detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The Xiangya process was constructed according to multi-index, compared with clinical indicators, CT results and national standards, the efficiency of detecting confirmed cases were verified in the test and verification library. Results: A continuous cohort of 382 adults who screened COVID-19 was included in which 261 cases were in the test library and 121 cases were in the verification library. In the 382 cases, 192 were males (50.3%) and 190 were females (49.7%), with a median age of 35 years (range: 15-92 years). There were 183 cases (47.9%) with epidemiological history, 275 cases (72.0%) with fever, 212 cases (55.5%) with decreased hemolytic lymphocytes, CT positive 114 cases (29.8%), 43 cases (11.3%) with positive CT-COVID-19, and 30 cases (7.9%) with positive throat swab nucleic acid. Compared with clinical indicators, the sensitivity and specificity of CT were 0.950 and 0.704, respectively. The accuracy of CT to make a definite diagnosis was higher than that of epidemiological history, fever, and blood lymph count decline (0.809 vs 0.660, 0.532, 0.596, P=0.001, 0.002, 0.003, respectively). The sensitivity of this process and the program recommended by the Health Commission all were high (all were 1.000) , and the specificity and accuracy of the process were higher than the program recommended by the Health Commission (0.872 vs 0.765, 0.778 vs 0.592, both P<0.001). The CT-COVID-19 would have reduced the missed diagnosis rate caused by false negative of nucleic acid test (31 vs 64, difference rate 51.6%), the positive rate of nucleic acid test was 64.5% (20/31). In validation library, the specificity and accuracy of the Xiangya process was 0.967, the positive rate of nucleic acid test was 76.9% (10/13). Conclusions: The Xiangya process can predict the nucleic acid test results of COVID-19 well, and can be applied as a reliable basis for confirmed cases detection in adults and adolescent (≥12 years) in areas other than Hubei during the epidemic period of COVID-19. The cohort size needs to be increased for further validation.","Xiong, Z; Fu, L; Zhou, H; Liu, J K; Wang, A M; Huang, Y; Huang, X; Yi, B; Wu, J; Li, C H; Quan, J; Li, M; Leng, Y S; Luo, W J; Hu, C P; Liao, W H",Zhonghua yi xue za zhi,https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn112137-20200228-00499; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32157849/,518

Those who care for children (henceforth caregivers) may face the brunt of these changes, but little research has examined the consequences of COVID-19 on eating pathology in caregivers. A community sample of caregivers (N = 140) completed a cross-sectional online survey assessing demographics, stress and concern about weight gain before/during COVID-19, disordered eating (Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire-Short Form), and emotional eating (Emotional Eating Scale-Revised). Significant positive relationships emerged between stress and concern about weight gain before/during COVID-19 and disordered eating, emotional eating-depression, emotional eating-anger/anxiety, and emotional eating-boredom. Stress and concern about weight gain during, not before, COVID-19 positively predicted variance in disordered eating and emotional eating. Stress was associated with lower emotional eating-boredom when concern about weight gain during COVID-19 was low. Stress was associated with lower emotional eating-depression when concern about weight gain before COVID-19 was low, but when high, stress was associated with higher emotional eating-depression. Stress and concern about weight gain before/during COVID-19 may be relevant to worsened disordered eating and emotional eating in caregivers, a neglected population in the literature. Targeting concern about weight gain may weaken the relationship between stress and emotional eating-depression and emotional eating-boredom among caregivers in the context of COVID-19.","Jordan, Amy K; Barnhart, Wesley R; Studer-Perez, Emma I; Kalantzis, Maria A; Hamilton, Lindsay; Musher-Eizenman, Dara R",Appetite,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2021.105580; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34186158/,518

Thus, approaches to promote their degradation and inhibit their formation are beneficial for stroke recovery. The interaction of microglia and astrocytes is known to be involved in glial scar formation after stroke; however, how microglia affect glial scar formation remains unclear. Methods: Mice were treated daily with M2 microglial small extracellular vesicles through tail intravenous injections from day 1 to day 7 after middle cerebral artery occlusion. Glial scar, infarct volume, neurological score were detected after ischemia. microRNA and related protein were examined in peri-infarct areas of the brain following ischemia. Results: M2 microglial small extracellular vesicles reduced glial scar formation and promoted recovery after stroke and were enriched in miR-124. Furthermore, M2 microglial small extracellular vesicle treatment decreased the expression of the astrocyte proliferation gene signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, one of the targets of miR-124, and glial fibrillary acidic protein and inhibited astrocyte proliferation both in vitro and in vivo. It also decreased Notch 1 expression and increased Sox2 expression in astrocytes, which suggested that astrocytes had transformed into neuronal progenitor cells. Finally, miR-124 knockdown in M2 microglial small extracellular vesicles blocked their effects on glial scars and stroke recovery. Conclusions: Our results showed, for the first time, that microglia regulate glial scar formation via small extracellular vesicles, indicating that M2 microglial small extracellular vesicles could represent a new therapeutic approach for stroke.","Li, Zongwei; Song, Yaying; He, Tingting; Wen, Ruoxue; Li, Yongfang; Chen, Tingting; Huang, Shuxian; Wang, Yongting; Tang, Yaohui; Shen, FanXia; Tian, Heng-Li; Yang, Guo-Yuan; Zhang, Zhijun",Theranostics,https://doi.org/10.7150/thno.48761; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33391532/,518

Signs and symptoms of gallstone disease are nausea/vomiting, right upper quadrant tenderness, and a history of gallstone disease. With persistence of the obstruction, inflammation and bacterial overgrowth within the gallbladder lumen and tissue may lead to eventual venous congestion, pressure necrosis and even empyema of the gallbladder. CASE REPORT A 60-year old male presented with complaints of mild mid-epigastric pain radiating to the back. He denied previous similar history. CT and ultrasound of the abdomen revealed acute cholecystitis. During surgery, it was clear that the imaging did not accurately represent the severity of the infection and he was diagnosed with gallbladder empyema. Surgery was difficult but was successfully finished. The patient's symptoms and laboratory results normalized by post-operative day 3 and he was discharged. He had no further complications during 2-week follow up. CONCLUSIONS Physicians should keep the abnormal presentations of gallbladder empyema in mind and prepare themselves for a presentation different from imaging during surgery.

Furthermore, it is also noted that achieving knowledge sharing at different levels by building diverse knowledge-sharing platforms can promote the risk control of rural inclusive finance from the individual-organization level to the chain level of multi-organization collaboration, which contributes to the formation of symbiotic risk control ecology. Research limitations/implications: The authors have formed the “Chinese wisdom” to deal with inclusive financial risks and to promote in-depth development in relation to the “last mile” practice of inclusive finance, which means the final and the most important phase of a project. The conclusions contribute to enriching the outcomes regarding the risk control of rural inclusive finance, provide experiences to its sustainable development and offer a reference to other countries with their risk control of rural inclusive finance. Originality/value: Drawing on the knowledge-sharing approach, this study creatively resolves the persistent problems in the risk control of rural inclusive finance, which forms a powerful supplement to the extant literature. Meanwhile, the paper combines the two contextual factors of the post-COVID-19 era and emerging economies, which can be deemed as a novel attempt. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Duan, Y.; Liu, Y.; Chen, Y.; Guo, W.; Yang, L.",Journal of Knowledge Management,https://doi.org/10.1108/jkm-11-2020-0854,518

The novel design of the prototype Schwarzschild-Couder Telescope (pSCT) is motivated by the need of the next-generation Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) observatory to have the ability to perform wide ($\geq 8^{\circ}$) field-of-view observations simultaneously with superior imaging of atmospheric cascades (resolution of $0.067^{\circ}$ per pixel or better). The pSCT design, if implemented in the CTA installation, has the potential to improve significantly both the $\gamma$-ray angular resolution and the off-axis sensitivity of the observatory, reaching nearly the theoretical limit of the technique and thereby making a major impact on the CTA observatory sky survey programs, follow-up observations of multi-messenger transients with poorly known initial localization, as well as on the spatially resolved spectroscopic studies of extended $\gamma$-ray sources.

The sample consisted of 16 participants who had visibility over the entire QA – Maximize Value relationship, were knowledgeable, willing to participate and had between 4 and 12 years’ higher education experience. The data was collected through focus, elite groups and in-depth interviews based on the participants’ perspectives of their experiences. The collected data was subjected to content analysis. The following research questions focused on: definition of QA, the definition of quality education and stakeholders’ expectations for the education setting.FindingsThe study identified 10 categories that drive the QA – Maximize Value for stakeholder relationships in higher education settings. The categories are, namely, the definition of QA;definition of quality management;value for governing council;value for lecturers and staff;value for students;value for employers;value for government;definition of quality education;continuous improvement;and QA in universities. The main findings of the research related to “how” and “why” QA create value for stakeholders. The results of the study indicate that the governing council representatives’ (key stakeholders) expected value creation through improved management and proper education policy. The expected value creation for lecturers and university staff included career advancement, good working conditions of service, remuneration and the excellent performance of students. The paper finds that QA in higher education is contingent on senior management commitment to the strategic decision on overall objectives, management of the facility, financial and human resources, which are geared toward ensuring effective teaching, student learning and value maximization for all stakeholders.Research limitations/implicationsThe limitation of the study is that the major stakeholders considered were all from universities. Other stakeholders such as employers from the industry and other sectors should be included in a future study.Practical implicationsBased on the study findings, two major implications for training of senior management, deans and heads of departments in the concepts of QA to maximize value for all stakeholders;and the QA system selected for the university must be “fit for purpose” were drawn, leading to recommendations for future practice. These findings can help universities to develop strategies that improve educational quality and maximize value for all stakeholders. The authors suggested some propositions that can be examined in-depth in future research endeavors so as to enhance the understanding of the predictors of QA in education and the expectations of different stakeholders.Originality/valueThe originality of the study lies in the perspective of experienced participants who had visibility over the entire QA –Maximize Value relationship and were knowledgeable. Based on the use of the grounded theory approach and the view of major stakeholders used in this research, the findings emphasize the stakeholders’ – driven definition of quality education that focuses on value maximization for all stakeholders. This is different from the majority of the existing definitions in the quality literature that are primarily standard-driven, focusing on meeting a pre-defined set of standards, specifications, requirements and are set internally or externally. The approach provides an opportunity to increase the credibility and rigor of grounded theory research.","Tetteh, Godson A.; Amoako-Gyampah, Kwasi Twumasi Juliet",Quality Assurance in Education,https://doi.org/10.1108/qae-12-2020-0141,518

It is a burning issue worldwide in the current COVID-19 situation. The aim of this study is to examine the financial risks of Czech companies. By employing the stepwise regression technique to estimate the financial risks, the p-values of all selected 15 financial ratios (explanatory variables) were calculated. If the p-value of the variable is more than the level of significance, the particular variable is removed from the model and another regression model is calculated. The findings from the stepwise regression revealed that return on capital, current ratio, net working capital turnover rate, and current assets turnover rate have a positive influence on company’s financial health. On the contrary, return on capital employed, asset turnover rate, inventory turnover rate, fixed assets turnover rate, and debt to equity ratio negatively impact the company’s financial health.

The pieces of literature published in 2020 on the traditional application analyzed the phytochemical composition, pharmacological effects, and mechanisms of the different ethnic groups including Tibetan, Mongolian, Zhuang, Dai, and Uyghur medicines, among others. This study found that some projects were stalled or delayed due to the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak in 2020 compared with 2019, resulting in a decrease in the number of articles in certain fields. However, studied on Chinese minority traditional medicine have shown an overall upward trend this year with the Tibetan, Mongolian, and Dai medicines as the top three. In addition, the Chinese minority traditional medicine application under the coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic situation background was also summarized. Consequently, this study found that among the Chinese minority traditional medicine-related publications in 2020, publications using Chinese minority traditional medicine to treat coronavirus disease 2019 account for a certain percentage.

We present two simulation-based optimization models for developing dynamic predictive resource distribution strategies for cross-regional pandemic outbreaks. In both models, the underlying simulation mimics the disease and population dynamics of the affected regions. The quantity-based optimization model generates a progressive allocation of limited quantities of mitigation resources, including vaccines, antiviral, administration capacities, and social distancing enforcement resources. The budget-based optimization model strives instead allocating a total resource budget. Both models seek to minimize the impact of ongoing outbreaks and the expected impact of potential outbreaks. The models incorporate measures of morbidity, mortality, and social distancing, translated into the societal and economic costs of lost productivity and medical expenses. The models were calibrated using historic pandemic data and implemented on a sample outbreak in Florida, with over four million inhabitants. The quantity-based model was found to be inferior to the budget-based model, which was advantageous in its ability to balance the varying relative cost and effectiveness of individual resources. The models are intended to assist public health policy makers in developing effective distribution policies for mitigation of influenza pandemics.","Uribe-Sánchez, Andrés; Savachkin, Alex",J Multidiscip Healthc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3004603/,518

It has commonly been associated with pulmonary manifestations and there is a growing body of evidence of multisystem involvement of the virus. As evidenced by various case reports and cohort studies, COVID-19-associated coagulopathy has been a common manifestation amongst the critically ill and has been associated with increased mortality. The presence of venous thromboembolic events in patients who are critically ill due to COVID-19 has prompted the adoption of anticoagulation regimens aimed at preventing thromboembolic phenomena. Coagulation abnormalities have also been implicated in the progression and the severity of COVID-19 related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). There is strong evidence that D-dimer levels help predict which patients are at risk of thromboembolic events, progression to ARDS, DIC, immune dysregulation and mortality. We will review the utility of D-dimer as screening tool and in the risk stratification of COVID-19 patients prone to developing thromboembolic events, DIC, immune dysregulation and death. To date, the studies that have been published show the presence of elevated D-dimer levels in both the adult and pediatric populations and the measured level correlates with disease severity. Studies have also shown the relative increase of D-dimer levels in non-survivors compared to survivors. The elevation of D-dimer levels has shown to guide clinical decision making, namely the initiation of therapeutic anticoagulation and mortality benefit in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia compared to severe non COVID-19 pneumonia. Although the current body of literature suggested the use of D-dimer as a risk stratification tool and as a test to augment clinical judgement regarding the initiation of anticoagulation, randomized control trials are needed to fully understand the relationship between COVID-19 infection and the efficacy of D-dimer assays in clinical decision making.","Kariyanna, Pramod Theetha; Aurora, Lyudmila; Jayarangaiah, Apoorva; Yadav, Vivek; Hossain, Naseem.

The present study was done to retrospectively assess the treatment strategies (e.g., pharmaceutical care services) for COVID-19 patients in selected hospitals and highlight the importance of such services in the management of a pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from a series of COVID-19 patients (978 patients; 658 males [66.9%] and 324 females [33.1%]) admitted to the selected hospitals in Tehran from 20 February to 19 March 2020 were retrieved retrospectively from the Health Information System (HIS) of the hospitals. The statistical tests were used for analyzing the effect and correlation of the variables (drugs) with the average length of stay (ALOS) in the hospital. RESULTS: Diverse medication classes and old drugs with or without strong evidence of therapeutic effects against the novel coronavirus, some previously tried as a treatment for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, were mostly used for the treatment of patients in the hospitals. Many medications (broad-spectrum antibiotics and antivirals) or combination therapies are used without evidence of their therapeutic effects during pandemics. CONCLUSION: Therefore, guidelines should be provided for the off-label use of these drugs by policymakers and stakeholders during a pandemic emergency due to high demands.

We present a stochastic model of a SARS outbreak in a community and its hospital. For a range of basic reproductive numbers (R(0)) corresponding to conditions in different cities (but with emphasis on R(0) approximately 3 as reported for Hong Kong and Singapore), we evaluate contact precautions and case management (quarantine and isolation) as containment measures. Hospital-based contact precautions emerge as the most potent measures, with hospital-wide measures being particularly important if screening of HCWs is inadequate. For R(0) = 3, case isolation alone can control a SARS outbreak only if isolation reduces transmission by at least a factor of four and the mean symptom-onset-to-isolation time is less than 3 days. Delays of a few days in contact tracing and case identification severely degrade the utility of quarantine and isolation, particularly in high-transmission settings. Still more detrimental are delays between the onset of an outbreak and the implementation of control measures; for given control scenarios, our model identifies windows of opportunity beyond which the efficacy of containment efforts is reduced greatly. By considering pathways of transmission in our system, we show that if hospital-based transmission is not halted, measures that reduce community-HCW contact are vital to preventing a widespread epidemic. The implications of our results for future emerging pathogens are discussed.","Lloyd-Smith, James O; Galvani, Alison P; Getz, Wayne M",Proceedings.

We previously isolated and characterized SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-like viruses from human and animals, respectively, suggesting that SARS could be transmitted from wild/farmed animals to humans. Comparison of the viral genomes indicated that sequence variation between animal and human isolates existed mainly in the spike (S) gene. We hypothesized that these variations may underlie a change of binding specificity of the S protein to the host cells, permitting viral transmission from animals to humans. Here we report that four 20-mer synthetic peptides (S protein fragments), designed to span these sequence variation hotspots, exhibited significant antiviral activities in a cell line. SARS-CoV infectivity was reduced over 10 000-fold through pre-incubation with two of these peptides, while it was completely inhibited in the presence of three peptides. Molecular modelling of the SARS-CoV peplomer suggests that three of these antiviral peptides map to the interfaces between the three monomers of the trimeric peplomer rather than the heptad repeat region from which short peptides are known to inhibit viral entry. Our results revealed novel regions in the spike protein that can be targeted to inhibit viral infection.

OBJECTIVES To assess the impact of the local COVID-19 outbreak on routine child health services. METHODS The District Health Information System data set for KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) provincial health services was accessed, and monthly child health-related data were extracted for the period January 2018 - June 2020. Chronological and geographical variations in sentinel indicators for service access, service delivery and the wellbeing of children were assessed. RESULTS During April - June 2020, following the start of the COVID-19 outbreak in KZN, significant declines were seen for clinic attendance (36%; p=0.001) and hospital admissions (50%; p=0.005) of children aged <5 years, with a modest recovery in clinic attendance only. Among service delivery indicators, immunisation coverage recovered most rapidly, with vitamin A supplementation, deworming and food supplementation remaining low. Changes were less pronounced for in- and out-of-hospital births and uptake rates of infant polymerase chain reaction testing for HIV at birth, albeit with wide interdistrict variations, indicating inequalities in access to and provision of maternal and neonatal care. A temporary 47% increase in neonatal facility deaths was reported in May 2020 that could potentially be attributed to COVID-19-related disruption and diversion of health resources. CONCLUSIONS Multiple indicators demonstrated disruption in service access, service delivery and child wellbeing.

Piglets inoculated in utero at 92 or 104 gestational days (n = 12) were collected by Caesarean section at term and either sacrificed immediately or kept in isolators and allowed to live postnatally until 35 days postinoculation (PI). Caesarean-derived piglets inoculated at 1 day of age (n = 14) were sacrificed at 10, 21, 35, 42, and 49 days PI. Spleen and lymph nodes were collected for virologic and histopathological examinations. Clinical signs were not observed in any of the piglets. High virus titers (10(4.5-5.7) TCID50/g [TCID refers to tissue culture infectious dose]) were detected in 6 of the 26 piglets. Three of these 6 piglets were euthanized at 10 days PI, and infected cells of the monocyte-macrophage lineage (SWC3+, CD14+, and sialoadhesin [Sa]+ cells) and infected cells bearing lymphocyte markers (CD4+, CD8+, and immunoglobulin M+ cells) were identified by double-immunofluorescence labeling on serial cryostat sections. The other 3 piglets were euthanized at 21 and 35 days PI, and the majority of infected cells were SWC3+, CD14+, and Sa-. The absence of Sa in these infected cells, together with their localization in lymphocyte-dependent regions, suggests that they were infiltrating monocytic cells. Sialoadhesin is highly expressed in differentiated macrophages and not in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In all 6 piglets with high virus titers, lymphocyte depletion and infiltration of monocytic cells were observed. In the remaining 20 piglets with virus titers less than 10(4.5) TCID50/g, the majority of infected cells were SWC3+, CD14+, and Sa+. In conclusion, it can be stated that high PCV2 titers in lymphoid organs may lead to the development of histological lesions similar to those observed in pigs with postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome without causing disease. Furthermore, in lymphoid organs with high virus titers, infection occurs mainly in infiltrating monocytic cells and to a limited extent in cells bearing lymphocyte markers.","Sanchez, Romeo E; Meerts, Peter; Nauwynck, Hans J; Ellis, John A; Pensaert, Maurice B","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15152830/,518

In addition, radiolabeled Nsp3 was cleaved successively with cyanogen bromide and trypsin, and microscale iron-chelate affinity chromatography was used to enrich phosphopeptides. By combining these methods, we showed that Nsp3 is phosphorylated on serine residues 320, 327, 332, 335, 356, 359, 362, and 367, and is heavily phosphorylated on peptide Gly(338)-Lys(415), which carries 7-12 phosphates distributed over its 13 potential phosphorylation sites. These analytical findings were corroborated by constructing a Nsp3 derivative devoid of phosphorylation. The results represent the first determination of phosphorylation sites of an alphavirus nonstructural protein, but the approach can be utilized in phosphoprotein analysis in general.","Vihinen, H; Saarinen, J",The Journal of biological chemistry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10851234/,518

These virions have different abundance, structure, location and roles in the virus life-cycle. Here, the formation and function of these virions are considered with emphasis on the EEV form and its precursors, IEV and CEV. IMV is the most abundant form of virus and is retained in cells until lysis; it is a robust, stable virion and is well suited to transmit infection between hosts. IEV is formed by wrapping of IMV with intracellular membranes, and is an intermediate between IMV and CEV/EEV that enables efficient virus dissemination to the cell surface on microtubules. CEV induces the formation of actin tails that drive CEV particles away from the cell and is important for cell-to-cell spread. Lastly, EEV mediates the long-range dissemination of virus in cell culture and, probably, in vivo. Seven virus-encoded proteins have been identified that are components of IEV, and five of them are present in CEV or EEV. The roles of these proteins in virus morphogenesis and dissemination, and as targets for neutralizing antibody are reviewed. The production of several different virus particles in the VV replication cycle represents a coordinated strategy to exploit cell biology to promote virus spread and to aid virus evasion of antibody and complement.","Smith, Geoffrey L; Vanderplasschen, Alain; Law, Mansun",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12466468/,518

The main potential benefits of medical assistance in these patients reside in the careful monitoring of their clinical status, the maintenance of adequate hydration and oxygenation, the preservation of the airway opened and cleared of secretions and the option to perform parental education. There is no convincing evidence that any other form of therapy will reliably provide beneficial effects in infants with bronchiolitis and currently, any treatment beyond supportive care should be prescribed on a case-by-case basis with watchful appraisal of its effects. Therapies such as ribavirin, IFN, vitamin A, antibiotics, mist therapy or anticholinergics, have not demonstrated any measurable clinical effect. Several studies and meta-analyses with beta(2)-agonists and corticosteroids have failed to show any benefit of significant extent, however, physicians keep favouring their use. Presently, adrenaline has received rather consistent support from clinical trials but it is not yet widely prescribed. There are other therapeutic strategies, for instance, heliox, hypertonic saline, noninvasive ventilation, physical therapy techniques, thickened feeds or palivizumab that have shown promising potential benefits, but evidence supporting its use is still limited and further studies should be warranted. In the meantime, infants with acute viral bronchiolitis should be treated following evidence-based clinical practice guidelines, keeping the patient central in the process and being sensitive to social, cultural and familiar influences on their treatment strategy.","Martinón-Torres, Federico",Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12877643/,518

However, the receptor of the PEDV has not been identified yet. A virus overlay protein binding assay (VOPBA) was used to identify PEDV binding protein in permissive cells. The binding ability of PEDV to porcine APN (pAPN) and the effects of pAPN on infectivity of PEDV in Vero cells were also investigated. VOPBA identified a 150 kDa protein, as a putative PEDV receptor in enterocytes and swine testicle (ST) cells. Further the PEDV binding to pAPN was blocked by anti-pAPN and pAPN enhanced PEDV infectivity in Vero cells. In conclusion, these results suggested that pAPN may act as a receptor of PEDV.","Oh, Jin Sik; Song, Dae Sub; Park, Bong Kyun",Journal of veterinary science,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14685034/,518

In less than six months since its first diagnosis in Wuhan, China, the COVID-19 infectious disease due to the novel coronavirus has infected over 5,000,000 people and claimed over 350,000 lives. In the United States, most of the cases are in large urban settings along the coasts, but the disease is slowly progressing through the mainland. Kansas, with its particular location in the midwest United States, has seen a relatively small number of cases, but these are increasing. The Kansas government took radical measures to prevent the spread of the disease. According to the Health Beliefs Model, an individual's perception of risk will dictate engagement with preventive behaviors. Knowledge about the disease and preventive measures drive the risk assessment. Knowledge is dependant on the sources of information used. This study explored these metrics in a sample of Kansans living in the times of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods A combination of snowball samples and random distribution through social media was used to recruit participants to an online survey. The risk and knowledge instrument was developed and validated by WHO Europe. Data collection lasted 96 hours. Results The attitudes and behaviors of Kansans concerning COVID-19 were consistent with its location in an area of the country with a relatively lower incidence of the disease. Participants had good knowledge about the disease and preventive measures and were willing to comply with recommendations from local authorities. Conclusion Localized information sources that cater to the community are often primary, while social media is not a valuable source for information pertinent to COVID-19.","Geana, Mugur V",Kansas journal of medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32612749/,518
194342,[The role of children in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2].,2020-06-03,"The double-stranded RNA genome of giardiavirus (GLV) has only two large open reading frame (ORFs). The 100-kDa capsid polypeptide (p100) is encoded by ORF1, whereas the only other viral polypeptide, the 190-kDa GLV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (p190), is synthesized as an ORF1-ORF2 fusion protein by a (-1) ribosomal frameshifting. Edman degradation revealed that p100 was N-terminally blocked except for 2 to 5% of it that showed free N terminus starting from amino acid residue 33 of ORF1. Studies using antiserum targeted against amino acid residues 6 to 27 indicated that this region (NT) is absent from viral p100 and p190, while pulse-labelling experiments showed that NT is present in nascent p100 synthesized in GLV-infected Giardia lamblia but removed subsequently. In contrast, this region was retained in the two viral proteins synthesized in vitro, and it was not removed upon prolonged incubation or inclusion of microsomal fraction in the in vitro translation reaction mixtures. These results suggest that endoplasmic reticulum is not involved in the protein processing and that the precursors of p100 and p190 are incapable of cleaving themselves or each other. This specific cleavage was reproduced when lysates from GLV-infected G. lamblia were added, but not those from uninfected cells. The cleavage activity was relatively insensitive to phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, but it was inhibitable by leupeptin or E-64, two known specific inhibitors of cysteine protease. The possible origin of this processing activity is discussed.","Yu, D; Wang, C C; Wang, A L",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7707505/,518

BB diabetes-prone (BBDP) rats develop T1D spontaneously. BB diabetes-resistant (BBDR) rats develop T1D after immunological perturbations that include regulatory T cell (Treg) depletion plus administration of low doses of a TLR ligand, polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid. Using both models, we analyzed CD4+CD25+ and CD4+CD45RC- candidate rat Treg populations. In BBDR and control Wistar Furth rats, CD25+ T cells comprised 5-8% of CD4+ T cells. In vitro, rat CD4+CD25+ T cells were hyporesponsive and suppressed T cell proliferation in the absence of TGF-beta and IL-10, suggesting that they are natural Tregs. In contrast, CD4+CD45RC(-) T cells proliferated in vitro in response to mitogen and were not suppressive. Adoptive transfer of purified CD4+CD25+ BBDR T cells to prediabetic BBDP rats prevented diabetes in 80% of recipients. Surprisingly, CD4+CD45RC-CD25- T cells were equally protective. Quantitative studies in an adoptive cotransfer model confirmed the protective capability of both cell populations, but the latter was less potent on a per cell basis. The disease-suppressing CD4+CD45RC-CD25- population expressed PD-1 but not Foxp3, which was confined to CD4+CD25+ cells. We conclude that CD4+CD25+ cells in the BBDR rat act in vitro and in vivo as natural Tregs. In addition, another population that is CD4+CD45RC-CD25- also participates in the regulation of autoimmune diabetes.","Hillebrands, Jan-Luuk; Whalen, Barbara; Visser, Jeroen T J; Koning, Jasper; Bishop, Kenneth D; Leif, Jean; Rozing, Jan; Mordes, John P; Greiner, Dale L; Rossini, Aldo A",Journal of immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17114453/,518

Oligonucleotides specific for sequences within the S2 region of the spike (S) gene (Lin et al., 1991a) and nucleocapsid (N) gene (Zwaagstra et al., 1992) gave the appropriate products with all 41 isolates. Oligonu-cleotide pair UTR1 - UTR2 +, corresponding to sequences within the 3 untranslated region (UTR) of the genome, also gave the predicted product with all the isolates. Oligonucleotide pair UTR3 - /UTR4 + was internal to oligonucleotides UTR1 - /UTR2 + and was used in a nested-set arrangement for greater specificity and sensitivity, giving the correct product with the 39 isolates examined. Oligonucleotide pair S1Unil - /S1Uni2 + was used to produce a 1.6 kb cDNA, corresponding to most of the S1 region of the S gene, with 24/24 isolates tested. This oligonucleotide pair was less suited than the others for routine detection of IBV but is recommended for the amplification of the S1 region of the S gene of new isolates for subsequent analysis. Other oligonucleotide pairs, yielding cDNA corresponding to the variable region of the IBV genome where genes 3 and 4 (M) overlap, were selected to be largely specific for Massachusetts serotype isolates, in the context of European strains. RT-PCR analysis using these oligonucleotide pairs showed that a number of field isolate preparations also contained a small amount of Massachusetts serotype virus, probably of vaccine origin and indicative of low level persistent infection. These results suggest that any strain of IBV is likely to be detectable by RT-PCR with at least one of our primer pairs.","Adzhar, A; Shaw, K; Britton, P; Cavanagh, D",Avian pathology : journal of the W.V.P.A,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18645901/,518

DESIGN Qualitative content analysis. SETTING Canada. PARTICIPANTS Sixteen family physicians who have experienced a public health crisis. METHODS Semistructured interviews were conducted with 16 family physicians practising in various regions across Canada who had experienced what they defined as a public health crisis. These events included environmental crises, like forest fires and hurricanes, and infectious disease crises, like the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and H1N1 outbreaks. Interview transcripts were coded using an inductive qualitative content analysis method, specifically focusing on recommendations from participants on how to improve risk communication to family physicians in the event of a future public health crisis. MAIN FINDINGS Based on their personal experiences, participants had many explicit recommendations on how to improve risk communication strategies in the event of a future public health crisis. These included having a single trusted source of information; having timely and succinct communication; having consideration for learners; ensuring access to information for all physicians; improving public health and family medicine collaboration; having crisis information for patients; and creating communication infrastructure before a crisis occurs. CONCLUSION This research provides thoughtful and varied considerations and advice from practising family physicians on how to improve risk communication from public health agencies and professional organizations to this group in the event of a public health crisis. With improved communications between these bodies and family physicians, practitioners will be better informed and prepared to provide the best possible care to their patient populations during such events.","Kain, Nicole A; Jardine, Cynthia G",Canadian family physician Medecin de famille canadien,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32165480/,518

This procedure elucidated the inappropriateness of the active site for non-covalent inhibitors, but it has also shown that there exists an additional, more favorable, allosteric binding site, which could be a better target for non-covalent inhibitors, as it could prevent dimerization and activation of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro. Two such examples are radotinib and nilotinib, tyrosine kinase inhibitors already in use for treatment of leukemia and which binding to the newly found allosteric binding site was also confirmed using MD simulations.

Specifically, we simultaneously collected (for the first time) multi-sensor data including urban environmental factors (e.g. air pollution including: PM1, PM2.5, PM10, Oxidised, Reduced, NH3 and Noise, People Count in the vicinity), body reaction (physiological reactions including: EDA, HR, HRV, Body Temperature, BVP and movement) and individuals' perceived responses (e.g. self-reported valence) in urban settings. Our users followed a pre-specified urban path and collected the data using a comprehensive sensing edge devices. The data is instantly fused, time-stamped and geo-tagged at the point of collection. A range of multivariate statistical analysis techniques have been applied including Principle Component Analysis, Regression and spatial visualisations to unravel the relationship between the variables. Results showed that EDA and Heart Rate Variability HRV are noticeably impacted by the level of Particulate Matters (PM) in the environment well with the environmental variables. Furthermore, we adopted Deep Belief Network to extract features from the multimodel data feed which outperformed Convolutional Neural Network and achieved up to (a=80.8%, {\sigma}=0.001) accuracy.","Johnson, Thomas; Kanjo, Eiman; Woodward, Kieran",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.12615v1.pdf,518

We carried out an ex vivo exposure of gill of Corydoras paleatus fish to 100 µg L-1 of AgNP or AgNO3, alone and in combination with 10 mg L-1 of humic acids (HA), with the aim to evaluate the potential mitigation of HA on AgNP toxic effects. We analyzed Ag accumulation and oxidative stress biomarkers. The results showed high bioaccumulation after the AgNO3+HA exposure. An inhibition of glutathione-S-transferase enzymatic activity and depletion of reduced glutathione levels were registered after the AgNO3 exposure, and increased lipid peroxidation levels in the case of AgNP one. Oxidative responses were mitigated when the HA were present in the media.

The identification of novel drugs and efficient therapies against these infectious viruses is need of the hour. The eruption of COVID-19 is caused by a novel acute respiratory syndrome virus SARS-CoV-2 which has taken the whole world by storm as it has transformed into a global pandemic. This lethal syndrome is a global health threat to general public which has already affected millions of people. Despite the development of some potential vaccines and repurposed drugs by some Pharma companies, this health emergency needs more attention due to the less efficacy of these vaccines coupled with the emergence of novel and resistant strains of SARS-CoV-2. Due to enormous structural diversity and biological applications, natural products are considered as a wonderful source of drugs for such diseases. Natural product based drugs constitute a substantial proportion of the pharmaceutical market particularly in the therapeutic areas of infectious diseases and oncology. The naturally occurring bioactive antiviral phytochemicals including alkaloids, flavonoids and peptides have been subjected to virtual screening against COVID-19. Since there is no specific medicine available for the treatment of Covid-19, designing new drugs using in silico methods plays an all important role to find that magic bullet which can target this lethal virus. The in silico method is not only quick but economical also when compared to the other conventional methods which are hit and trial methods. Based on this in silico approach, various natural products have been recently identified which might have a potential to inhibit COVID-19 outbreak. These natural products have been shown by these docking studies to interact with the spike protein of the novel coronavirus. This spike protein has been shown to bind to a transmembrane protein called Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), this protein acts as a receptor for the viral spike protein. This comprehensive review article anticipates providing a summary of the authentic and peer reviewed published literature about the potential of natural metabolites that can be developed into possible lead compounds against this new threat of Covid-19. Main focus of the article will be to highlight natural sources of potential anti-coronavirus molecules, mechanism of action, docking studies and the target proteins as well as their toxicity profiles. This review article intends to provide a starting point for the research endeavors that are needed for the design and development of drugs based on pure natural products, their synthetic or semi-synthetic derivatives and standardized plant extracts.

The leading public health institutions around the world have developed and established interim policies and guidelines for researchers and biobank staff to handle the infectious biospecimens safely and adequately from COVID-19 patients. A study of these important and complementary policies and guidelines is conducted in this study. It should be emphasized that the COVID-19 biospecimens must be collected, processed, and preserved by trained personnel equipped with right personal protective equipment to prevent the transmission of the coronavirus and ensure the specimen quality for testing and research. Six of the leading global public health organizations or institutions included in this study are the World Health Organization, the Pan American Health Organization, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Public Health England, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and the Office of Research at the University of California, San Francisco. In conclusion, following the recommended guidance and policies with extreme precautions is essential to ensure the quality of the collected COVID-19 biospecimens and accuracy of the conducted research or treatment, and prevent any possible transmission.

Treatments for COVID-19-associated coagulopathy are still a clinical challenge. An advancement in the knowledge of mechanisms of the excessive or inappropriate activation of the complement cascade involved in the genesis of COVID-19-associated coagulopathy might be a fundamental approach for developing novel classes of anticoagulant drugs. In this context, there is emerging evidence indicating that C5a, a component of the complement system, and its receptors (C5aRs) play a critical role in the genesis of the COVID-19-associated hypercoagulable state. Thus, this review describes the mechanisms by which C5a/C5aR signaling participates in the cascade of events involved in the pathophysiology of COVID-19-associated coagulopathy.

METHODS: We examined 31 eyes of 31 patients with pseudoexfoliation and cataract (without glaucoma) and 30 eyes of 30 patients with cataract. We collected aqueous humor samples from all patients at the time of cataract surgery through a limbal paracentesis via a 25-gauge cannula mounted on a tuberculin syringe that received 100 to 150 µL of aqueous humor. We measured levels of aqueous humor Heat shock protein 70, periostin, and irisin using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay methods. RESULTS: The age (p=0.221) and gender (p=0.530) means were similar between the pseudoexfoliation and control groups. The mean Heat shock protein 70 level (29.22 ± 9.46 ng/mL; 17.88-74.46) in the pseudoexfoliation group was significantly higher than that in the control group (19.03 ± 7.05 ng/mL; 9.93-35.52; p<0.0001). The mean periostin level was significantly higher (6017.32 ± 1271.79 pg/mL; 3787.50-10803.57) in the pseu doexfoliation group than that in the control group (4073.63 ± 1422.79 pg/mL; 2110.44-7490.64; p<0.0001).

The aim of the study was to compare diagnostic performance of admission chest CT and LUS for the diagnosis of COVID-19. METHODS: We included patients admitted to emergency department between February 21-March 6, 2020 (high prevalence group, HP) and between March 30-April 13, 2020 (moderate prevalence group, MP) undergoing LUS and chest CT within 12â¯h. Chest CT was considered positive in case of ""indeterminate""/""typical"" pattern for COVID-19 by RSNA classification system. At LUS, thickened pleural line withâ¯&#8805;â¯three B-lines at least in one zone of the 12 explored was considered positive. Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and AUC were calculated for CT and LUS against real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and serology as reference standard. RESULTS: The study included 486 patients (males 61 %; median age, 70 years): 247 patients in HP (COVID-19 prevalence 94 %) and 239 patients in MP (COVID-19 prevalence 45 %). In HP and MP respectively, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV were 90-95 %, 43-69 %, 96-72 %, 20-95 % for CT and 94-93 %, 7-31 %, 94-52 %, 7-83 % for LUS. CT demonstrated better performance than LUS in diagnosis of COVID-19, both in HP (AUC 0.75 vs 0.51; Pâ¯<â¯0.001) and MP (AUC 0.85 vs 0.62; Pâ¯<â¯0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Admission chest CT shows better performance than LUS for COVID-19 diagnosis, at varying disease prevalence.

The impact of uterine sliding sign has not been previously demonstrated in this practice setting. METHODS: Physicians' remote interpretations of transvaginal ultrasound examinations in 2016, before uterine sliding sign, were compared to examinations in 2019 after addition of uterine sliding sign to determine the diagnostic rates. Surgical and histopathological results were reviewed to determine sensitivity and specificity of the respective exam techniques. RESULTS: Two hundred eighty-five transvaginal ultrasounds were performed in 2016 and 390 sliding sign ultrasounds in 2019. The number of deeply infiltrating endometriosis cases identified increased significantly from 2% to 6% during the study period (chi-square, Fisher's exact test p = .012). The sensitivity and specificity of routine pelvic sonography for detecting deeply infiltrating endometriosis improved from 36%/94% to 68%/98%. CONCLUSIONS: Uterine sliding sign videos should be included in the standard sonographic protocol for patients presenting with chronic pelvic pain, endometriosis history, or sonographic evidence of endometriosis in the setting of physicians interpreting sonographic images obtained by non-physicians.","Young, Scott W; Dahiya, Nirvikar; Yi, Johnny; Wasson, Megan; Davitt, John; Patel, Maitray D",J. ultrasound med,,518

321577,Covid-19: Lessons from hospital preparedness for radiation accidents,2020,"Despite the reported increase in SARS-CoV-2-infected pets, the description of the clinical features from natural infection and the medical follow up in symptomatic pets is still not sufficiently documented. This study reports the case of an indoor cat that displayed respiratory signs and a gastrointestinal syndrome, following the COVID-19 diagnosis of his owners. Thoracic radiographies were suggestive of bronchial pneumonia, while blood tests were indicative of a mild inflammatory process. Nasal and oropharyngeal swabs tested positive through RT-qPCR assays targeting SARS-CoV-2 genes 14 days after his owners tested positive for the virus. Nasal swabs persisted to be RT-qPCR positive after 31 days. Serology confirmed the presence of antibodies through ELISA, electrochemiluminescence analysis and plaque reduction neutralization test, recording a high antibody titre after 31 days. The cat improved after medical treatment and clinically recovered. This study suggests that exposure to SARS-CoV-2 could lead to a natural infection with bronchial pneumonia in cats along with a possible prolonged persistence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the upper airways, albeit at a low level. The cat developed neutralizing antibodies, reaching a high titre after 31 days. Further descriptions of SARS-CoV-2 naturally infected pets, their medical management and diagnostic findings would be useful to enhance knowledge about COVID-19 in susceptible animals.","Natale, A.; Mazzotta, E.; Mason, N.; Ceglie, L.; Mion, M.; Stefani, A.; Fincato, A.; Bonfante, F.; Bortolami, A.; Monne, I.; Bellinati, L.; Guadagno, C.; Quaranta, E.; Pastori, A.; Terregino, C.",Animals,,518
325253,How and why have we so hazardously misconceived our NHS staff?,2021,"The evolutionary mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 viruses adapt to mammalian hosts and, potentially, undergo antigenic evolution depend on the ways genetic variation is generated and selected within and between individual hosts. Using domestic cats as a model, we show that SARS-CoV-2 consensus sequences remain largely unchanged over time within hosts, while dynamic sub-consensus diversity reveals processes of genetic drift and weak purifying selection. We further identify a notable variant at amino acid position 655 in Spike (H655Y), which was previously shown to confer escape from human monoclonal antibodies. This variant arises rapidly and persists at intermediate frequencies in index cats. It also becomes fixed following transmission in two of three pairs. These dynamics suggest this site may be under positive selection in this system and illustrate how a variant can quickly arise and become fixed in parallel across multiple transmission pairs. Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in cats involved a narrow bottleneck, with new infections founded by fewer than ten viruses. In RNA virus evolution, stochastic processes like narrow transmission bottlenecks and genetic drift typically act to constrain the overall pace of adaptive evolution. Our data suggest that here, positive selection in index cats followed by a narrow transmission bottleneck may have instead accelerated the fixation of S H655Y, a potentially beneficial SARS-CoV-2 variant. Overall, our study suggests species- and context-specific adaptations are likely to continue to emerge. This underscores the importance of continued genomic surveillance for new SARS-CoV-2 variants as well as heightened scrutiny for signatures of SARS-CoV-2 positive selection in humans and mammalian model systems.","Braun, Katarina M; Moreno, Gage K; Halfmann, Peter J; Hodcroft, Emma B; Baker, David A; Boehm, Emma C; Weiler, Andrea M; Haj, Amelia K; Hatta, Masato; Chiba, Shiho; Maemura, Tadashi; Kawaoka, Yoshihiro; Koelle, Katia; O039,; Connor, David H; Friedrich, Thomas C",PLoS Pathog,,518

333309,[Impact of confinement measures on the Covid-19 pandemic on alcohol risk consumption.],2021,"BACKGROUND: More than half of the global population is under strict forms of social distancing. Estimating the expected impact of lockdown and exit strategies is critical to inform decision makers on the management of the COVID-19 health crisis. METHODS: We use a stochastic age-structured transmission model integrating data on age profile and social contacts in Île-de-France to (i) assess the epidemic in the region, (ii) evaluate the impact of lockdown, and (iii) propose possible exit strategies and estimate their effectiveness. The model is calibrated to hospital admission data before lockdown. Interventions are modeled by reconstructing the associated changes in the contact matrices and informed by mobility reductions during lockdown evaluated from mobile phone data. Different types and durations of social distancing are simulated, including progressive and targeted strategies, with large-scale testing. RESULTS: We estimate the reproductive number at 3.18 [3.09, 3.24] (95% confidence interval) prior to lockdown and at 0.68 [0.66, 0.69] during lockdown, thanks to an 81% reduction of the average number of contacts. Model predictions capture the disease dynamics during lockdown, showing the epidemic curve reaching ICU system capacity, largely strengthened during the emergency, and slowly decreasing. Results suggest that physical contacts outside households were largely avoided during lockdown. Lifting the lockdown with no exit strategy would lead to a second wave overwhelming the healthcare system, if conditions return to normal. Extensive case finding and isolation are required for social distancing strategies to gradually relax lockdown constraints. CONCLUSIONS: As France experiences the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic in lockdown, intensive forms of social distancing are required in the upcoming months due to the currently low population immunity. Extensive case finding and isolation would allow the partial release of the socio-economic pressure caused by extreme measures, while avoiding healthcare demand exceeding capacity. Response planning needs to urgently prioritize the logistics and capacity for these interventions.","Di Domenico, Laura; Pullano, Giulia; Sabbatini, Chiara E; Boëlle, Pierre-Yves; Colizza, Vittoria",BMC Med,,518

The emergence of in-situ electrospinning technology has fundamentally solved this problem. It exhibits a high speed of hemostasis, and no bleeding occurs after surgery. Thus, it is of great significance. The use of sutures in some human organs, such as the intestines and bladder, is inadequate because fluid leakage occurs due to the presence of pinholes. Methods: Three types of large intestine wounds with an opening of about 1 cm were investigated. They were untreated, treated by needle and threaded, and treated by hand-held electrospinning, respectively. Results: The results show that hand-held electrospinning technique effectively prevented the exudation of fluids in the intestinal tract. The average diameter of the nanofibrous membrane was about 0.5 µm with hole of several micrometers. It can be elongated 90% without breakage. The hand-held electrospinning device could be used with nitrile gloves, preventing the risk of infection caused by exposed hands.

At the same time, recent geopolitical events combined with the COVID-19 outbreak is certain to lead to a reevaluation of global supply chains. Taken in combination it is likely that market and policy changes will create significant opportunities for the domestic manufacture of the components associated with the production of “green” energy. Using a combination of NAICS industrial data and proprietary firm data, that is scalable to the national level, we attempt to determine the real capacity for Wisconsin State manufacturers to participate in the component supply chain associated with wind and solar power. We find that, despite extensive industry and firm data, there are significant gaps in our ability to estimate firm-level output, in real terms, in the aggregate. This finding is indicative of the significant challenges associated with rapid structure economic reform such as the “Green New Deal” or the COVID response.

Besides, social media platforms and technological advances also appear to be another potential tool for promoting health and wellbeing, however, the capability of these interventions during the pandemic era is largely unknown. To explore the possible role of technological advances and social media platforms as an alternate tool in promoting a healthy living style during the COVID-19 era. The studies with the predefined criteria were used to synthesize information regarding the opportunities and challenges. Studies delivering lifestyle intervention using social media platforms, technologies for health promotion were considered for the review. The studies included to synthesize evidence were randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews and meta-analysis. Database like Medline, Scopus, and Science Direct were searched independently by two reviewers. A total of 17 studies were included in the review, Internet and lifestyle modification n = 2, mHealth and lifestyle modification n = 3, Social media and lifestyle modifications n = 3, technology adoption for lifestyle modification n = 4, and hazards = 5. Technology and social media-based interventions appear to be a promising technique for promoting health and wellbeing and it is the only effective method for delivering an intervention during a pandemic situation. However, there also appears a need for the development of guidelines for social media usage to prevent probable hazards.","Dixit, Snehil; Nandakumar, Girish",Rev Cardiovasc Med,,518

South Sudan, with a population of approximately 11 million, began COVID-19 surveillance in February 2020 and reported 6,931 cases through February 21, 2021. Surveillance data analyzed were from point of entry screening, testing of symptomatic persons who contacted an alert hotline, contact tracing, sentinel surveillance, and outbound travel screening. After travel restrictions were relaxed in early May 2020, international land and air travel resumed and mandatory requirements for negative pretravel test results were initiated. The percentage of all testing accounted for by travel screening increased >300%, from 21.1% to 91.0% during the analysis period, despite yielding the lowest percentage of positive tests among all sources. Although testing of symptomatic persons and contact tracing yielded the highest percentage of COVID-19 cases, the percentage of all testing from these sources decreased 88%, from 52.6% to 6.3% after support for these activities was reduced. Collectively, testing increased over the project period, but shifted toward sources least likely to yield positive results, possibly resulting in underreporting of cases. Policy, funding, and strategy decisions related to the COVID-19 pandemic response, such as those implemented in South Sudan, are important issues to consider when interpreting the epidemiology of COVID-19 outbreaks.","Shragai, T.; Summers, A.; Olushayo, O.; Rumunu, J.; Mize, V.; Laku, R.; Bunga, S.",Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report,,518
396204,[Diagnostic algorithm for COVID-19 at the ER],2020,"Objectives: During the COVID-19 pandemic, a significantly lower rate of health care usage was reported, potentially leading to delayed medical care. Diabetic ketoacidosis is an acute life-threatening complication of a delayed diagnosis in type 1 diabetes. Methods: We conducted a nationwide retrospective survey to investigate the frequency of diabetic ketoacidosis in children and adolescents with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes in Germany from March 13, when most federal states closed kindergartens and schools in order to reduce interpersonal contacts, through May 13, 2020. The estimated frequencies of diabetic ketoacidosis and severe diabetic ketoacidosis observed during the COVID-19 period and during the same periods in 2018 and 2019 were adjusted for age, sex, and migration background, and were compared by multivariable logistic regression analysis. Results: We obtained and analyzed data of 532 children and adolescents with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes from March 13 through May 13, 2020, from 217 diabetes centers participating in the German DPV register. Compared with the pre-COVID-19 periods, the mean estimated proportion of diabetic ketoacidosis and severe diabetic ketoacidosis increased during the COVID-19 period by 84.7% (95% confidence interval (CI), 59.6% to113.8%;p &lt; 0.0001) and 45.3% (95% CI, 14.5% to 84.3%;p = 0.002), respectively. Young children showed the highest risk for diabetic ketoacidosis and severe diabetic ketoacidosis during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusions: Delayed access to health care in Germany during the COVID-19 pandemic might explain the significant increase in ketoacidosis at diabetes diagnosis in children. Our results raise the question whether delayed diagnosis during the COVID-19 pandemic may also have harmed patients with other diseases.","Kamrath, C.; Mönkemöller, K.; Fink, K.; Biester, T.; Raile, K.; Rohrer, T.; Warncke, K.; Pappa, A.; Hammersen, J.; Holl, R.",Pediatric Diabetes,,518

This affected all aspects of society including health care. In the field of chronic neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD), teleneurology is employed in scenarios where face-to-face interactions are not possible. A growing number of clinicians and institutions are turning to teleneurology in order to providing medical care. AIMS OF THE ARTICLE: In this manuscript, we present a practical, 'how we do it in real life', example of a teleneurology appointment with a person with PD (PwP). METHODS: We elaborated a step-by-step approach of the main aspects of a consultation with a PwP and provide video illustration. RESULTS: The key aspects of a teleneurology appointment were separated into: (1) In the office, before the appointment; (2) History taking; (3) Examination; and (4) Finishing up.

397474,[Confusion and abdominal pain after COVID-19 vaccination],2021,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The modified TICI score is the benchmark for quantifying reperfusion after mechanical thrombectomy. There has been limited investigation into the reliability of this score. We aim to identify intra-rater and inter-rater reliability of the mTICI score among endovascular neurosurgeons. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four independent endovascular neurosurgeons (raters) reviewed angiograms of 67 patients at 2 time points. &#954; statistics assessed inter- and intrarater reliability and compared raters'-versus-proceduralists' scores. Reliability was also assessed for occlusion location and by dichotomizing modified TICI scores (0-2a versus 2b-3). RESULTS: Interrater reliability was moderate-to-substantial, weighted &#954; = 0.417-0.703, overall &#954; = 0.374 (P < .001). The dichotomized modified TICI score had moderate-to-substantial interrater agreement, &#954; statistics = 0.468-0.715, overall &#954; = 0.582 (P < .001). Intrarater reliability was moderate-to-almost perfect, weighted &#954; = 0.594-0.81. The dichotomized modified TICI score had substantial-to-almost perfect reliability, &#954; = 0.632-0.82. Proceduralists had fair-to-moderate agreement with raters, weighted &#954; = 0.348-0.574, and the dichotomized modified TICI score had fair-to-moderate agreement, &#954; = 0.365-0.544. When proceduralists and raters disagreed, proceduralists' scores were higher in 79.6% of cases. M1 followed by ICA occlusions had the highest agreement. CONCLUSIONS: The modified TICI score is a practical metric for assessing reperfusion after mechanical thrombectomy, though not without limitations. Agreement improved when scores were dichotomized around the clinically relevant threshold of successful revascularization. Interrater reliability improved with time, suggesting that formal training of interventionalists may improve reporting reliability. Agreement of the modified TICI scale is best with M1 and ICA occlusion and becomes less reliable with more distal or posterior circulation occlusions. These findings should be considered when developing research trials.","Heiferman, D M; Pecoraro, N C; Wozniak, A W; Ebersole, K C; Jimenez, L M; Reynolds, M R; Ringer, A J; Serrone, J C",AJNR am. j. neuroradiology,,518

Many researchers have investigated COVID-19 misinformation, but none of them was related to social media users’ diverse responses to different types of COVID-19 misinformation, which could be a timely exploration. To bridge this gap in scholarly literature, the present study based on 11,716 comments from 876 Facebook posts on five COVID-19 misinformation seeks to answer two relevant research questions: (a) How ignorant social media users are about misinformation? (b) How do they react to different types of misinformation? Following a quantitative content analysis method, this study produces a few novel findings. The results show that most of the users trust misinformation (60.88%), and fewer can deny (16.15%) or doubt (13.30%) the claims based on proper reasons. The acceptance of religious misinformation (94.72%) surpassed other types of misinformation. Most of the users react happily (34.50%) to misinformation: the users who accept misinformation are mostly happy (55.02%) because it may satisfy their expectations, and the users who distrust misinformation are mostly angry (44.05%) presuming it may cause harm to people.

400502,"Yonder: COVID non-compliance, antidepressant withdrawal, probiotics, and GPs in China",2021,"In the present report, we describe two small molecules with broad-spectrum antiviral activity. These drugs block the formation of the nodosome. The studies were prompted by the observation that infection of human fetal brain cells with Zika virus (ZIKV) induces the expression of nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2 (NOD2), a host factor that was found to promote ZIKV replication and spread. A drug that targets NOD2 was shown to have potent broad-spectrum antiviral activity against other flaviviruses, alphaviruses, enteroviruses, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Another drug that inhibits receptor-interacting serine/threonine protein kinase 2 (RIPK2), which functions downstream of NOD2, also decreased the replication of these pathogenic RNA viruses. The antiviral effect of this drug was particularly potent against enteroviruses. The broad-spectrum action of nodosome-targeting drugs is mediated in part by the enhancement of the interferon response. Together, these results suggest that further preclinical investigation of nodosome inhibitors as potential broad-spectrum antivirals is warranted.","Limonta, Daniel; Dyna-Dagman, Lovely; Branton, William; Mancinelli, Valeria; Makio, Tadashi; Wozniak, Richard W; Power, Christopher; Hobman, Tom C",Antimicrob Agents Chemother,,518

And, in much the same way, tourism aficionados, policy makers and communities are asking a similar question—what will the tourism landscape, and indeed the world, look like after the pandemic? As casualties from the crisis continue to fall by the wayside, the rethinking about what an emergent tourism industry might resemble is on in earnest. Many are hopeful that this wake-up call event is an opportunity to reshape tourism into a model that is more sustainable, inclusive and caring of the many stakeholders that rely on it. And some indicators, though not all, point in that direction. In line with this, the concept of ‘human flourishing’ offers merits as an alternative touchstone for evaluating the impacts of tourism on host communities. Human flourishing has a long genesis and its contemporary manifestation, pushed by COVID-19 and applied to travel and tourism, further expands the bounds of its application. Human flourishing has the potential to offer more nuanced sets of approaches by which the impact of tourism on host communities might be measured. The challenge remaining is how to develop robust indices to calibrate human flourishing policy successes.","Cheer, Joseph M.",Tour. Geogr.,,518

A review of literature to support the adoption of telemedicine in multidisciplinary pediatric otolaryngology is also incorporated. RESULTS: Telemedicine was successfully adopted for 7 multidisciplinary pediatric clinics with a variety of specialists: aerodigestive disorders, congenital hearing loss, microtia/aural atresia, orofacial clefting, sleep disorders, tracheostomy care, and velopharyngeal dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: Telemedicine is feasible for a variety of multidisciplinary clinics and its optimization is critical for providing care to complex pediatric otolaryngology patients during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.","Hoi, Karen K; Curtis, Stuart H; Driver, Lynn; Wisnosky, Erica; Zopf, David A; Bohm, Lauren A",Ann Otol Rhinol Laryngol,,518

For this purpose, it is imperative to understand the strategies of the body against oxygen imbalance-especially oxygen deficiency (hypoxia). Adaptation to hypoxia and maintenance of oxygen homeostasis involve a wide range of responses that occur at different organizational levels in the body. These responses are greatly influenced by perioperative patient management including factors such as perioperative drugs. Herein, the influence of perioperative patient management on the body's response to oxygen imbalance was reviewed with a special emphasis on hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), transcription factors whose activity are regulated by the perturbation of oxygen metabolism. The 2019 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to three researchers who made outstanding achievements in this field. While previous studies have reported the effect of perioperatively used drugs on hypoxia-induced gene expression mediated by HIFs, this review focused on effects of subacute or chronic hypoxia changes in gene expression that are mediated by the transcriptional regulator HIFs. The clinical implications and perspectives of these findings also will be discussed. Understanding the basic biology of the transcription factor HIF can be informative for us since anesthesiologists manage patients during the perioperative period facing the imbalances the oxygen metabolism in organ and tissue.

There are a few reports of allogeneic human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) as a potential treatment for ARDS. In this phase 1 clinical trial, we present the safety, feasibility, and tolerability of the multiple infusions of high dose MSCs, which originated from the placenta and umbilical cord, in critically ill COVID-19-induced ARDS patients. METHODS: A total of 11 patients diagnosed with COVID-19-induced ARDS who were admitted to the intensive care units (ICUs) of two hospitals enrolled in this study. The patients were critically ill with severe hypoxemia and required mechanical ventilation. The patients received three intravenous infusions (200 × 106 cells) every other day for a total of 600 × 106 human umbilical cord MSCs (UC-MSCs; 6 cases) or placental MSCs (PL-MSCs; 5 cases). FINDINGS: There were eight men and three women who were 42 to 66 years of age. Of these, six (55%) patients had comorbidities of diabetes, hypertension, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and cardiomyopathy (CMP). There were no serious adverse events reported 24-48 h after the cell infusions. We observed reduced dyspnea and increased SpO2 within 48-96 h after the first infusion in seven patients. Of these seven patients, five were discharged from the ICU within 2-7 days (average: 4 days), one patient who had signs of acute renal and hepatic failure was discharged from the ICU on day 18, and the last patient suddenly developed cardiac arrest on day 7 of the cell infusion. Significant reductions in serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-&#945;; P < 0.01), IL-8 (P < 0.05), and C-reactive protein (CRP) (P < 0.01) were seen in all six survivors. IL-6 levels decreased in five (P = 0.06) patients and interferon gamma (IFN-Î³) levels decreased in four (P = 0.14) patients. Four patients who had signs of multi-organ failure or sepsis died in 5-19 days (average: 10 days) after the first MSC infusion. A low percentage of lymphocytes (< 10%) and leukocytosis were associated with poor outcome (P = 0.02). All six survivors were well with no complaints of dyspnea on day 60 post-infusion. Radiological parameters of the lung computed tomography (CT) scans showed remarkable signs of recovery. INTERPRETATION: We suggest that multiple infusions of high dose allogeneic prenatal MSCs are safe and can rapidly improve respiratory distress and reduce inflammatory biomarkers in some critically ill COVID-19-induced ARDS cases. Patients that develop sepsis or multi-organ failure may not be good candidates for stem cell therapy. Large randomized multicenter clinical trials are needed to discern the exact therapeutic potentials of MSC in COVID-19-induced ARDS.","Hashemian, Seyed-Mohammad Reza; Aliannejad, Rasoul; Zarrabi, Morteza; Soleimani, Masoud; Vosough, Massoud; Hosseini, Seyedeh-Esmat; Hossieni, Hamed; Keshel, Saeid Heidari; Naderpour, Zeinab; Hajizadeh-Saffar, Ensiyeh; Shajareh, Elham; Jamaati, Hamidreza; Soufi-Zomorrod, Mina; Khavandgar, Naghmeh; Alemi, Hediyeh; Karimi, Aliasghar; Pak, Neda; Rouzbahani, Negin Hossieni; Nouri, Masoumeh; Sorouri, Majid; Kashani, Ladan; Madani, Hoda; Aghdami, Nasser; Vasei, Mohammad; Baharvand, Hossein",Stem Cell Res Ther,,518

Political leaders rarely can exchange this initial rally-around-effect into long-term support, however. The central question addressed in this paper is, why political leaders cannot maintain this increase in support over time. Based on three-wave panel data collected during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in Sweden (N = 1716), this paper investigates why political leaders cannot maintain initial popular support in the long run. Empirically, we find that perceptions of how Sweden is affected by the crisis and political ideology are both important drivers to understand the declining government approval following a rally-around-the-flag effect.

Multilevel logistic regression was used to model the relationship between death and several covariates: age, sex, deprivation (Index of Multiple Deprivation), ethnicity, frailty (Hospital Frailty Risk Score), presence of comorbidities (Charlson Comorbidity Index items), and date of discharge (whether alive or deceased). FINDINGS: 91â541 adult patients with COVID-19 were discharged during the study period, among which 28â200 (30·8%) in-hospital deaths occurred. The final multilevel logistic regression model accounted for age, deprivation score, and date of discharge as continuous variables, and sex, ethnicity, and Charlson Comorbidity Index items as categorical variables. In this model, significant predictors of in-hospital death included older age (modelled using restricted cubic splines), male sex (1·457 [1·408-1·509]), greater deprivation (1·002 [1·001-1·003]), Asian (1·211 [1·128-1·299]) or mixed ethnicity (1·317 [1·080-1·605]; vs White ethnicity), and most of the assessed comorbidities, including moderate or severe liver disease (5·433 [4·618-6·392]). Later date of discharge was associated with a lower odds of death (0·977 [0·976-0·978]); adjusted in-hospital mortality improved significantly in a broadly linear fashion, from 52·2% in the first week of March to 16·8% in the last week of May. INTERPRETATION: Reductions in the adjusted probability of in-hospital mortality for COVID-19 patients over time might reflect the impact of changes in hospital strategy and clinical processes. The reasons for the observed improvements in mortality should be thoroughly investigated to inform the response to future outbreaks. The higher mortality rate reported for certain ethnic minority groups in community-based studies compared with our hospital-based analysis might partly reflect differential infection rates in those at greatest risk, propensity to become severely ill once infected, and health-seeking behaviours. FUNDING: None.","Navaratnam, Annakan V; Gray, William K; Day, Jamie; Wendon, Julia; Briggs, Tim W R",Lancet Respir Med,,518

[Dutch],2020,"ABSTRACT Objective To assess the clinical and epidemiological profile of patients with olfactory dysfunction in the scenario of COVID-19 pandemic. Methods The study selected patients with loss of smell, previously screened by telemonitoring system of the Municipal Health Department of Goiânia (GO), Brazil, who agreed to answer a questionnaire about COVID-19 symptoms and findings of exams. The interviews were conducted by six otolaryngologists, who applied the specific questionnaire, over the phone. Results A total of 13,910 patients underwent telemonitoring, and 627 (4.51%) had olfactory loss complaints. Out of them, 330 were included in the survey. We observed a higher prevalence of altered smell in women (67%), and in patients aged under 50 years (86%). In most cases the manifestations had a sudden onset (70%), and in the first 5 days of illness (80%). The most prevalent associated symptom was a change in taste (89%), and only 2.7% of interviewed patients required hospitalization. Conclusion Anosmia in COVID-19 is more prevalent in females and individuals aged under 50 years. It is a relevant initial symptom predictive of the disease, together with dysgeusia.","Valletta, Raíssa Camelo de Camargo Leandro Azevedo Rodrigues Stela Oliveira da Silva Sarah Vidal Gonçalves Mateus Capuzzo Queiroz Nathálya Rodrigues Galvão Arlindo Rodrigues Avelino Melissa Ameloti Gomes","Einstein (Sao Paulo, Brazil)",,518
427111,Clinical meaning of laboratory tests for SARS-CoV-2. [Dutch],2020,"INTRODUCTION: Public transport accessible to older people may offer a transformative solution to achieving healthy ageing. However, the evidence to support such transport infrastructure modifications is unclear. Previous studies on public transport use and elderly health were mostly observational studies using cross-sectional data. Few studies have examined the before-and-after effects of a new metro, for example, to see if it leads to improved elderly health. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We use a new metro line in Hong Kong as a natural experiment to examine the impact of the metro-led public transport intervention on elderly health. In Hong Kong, more than 90% of daily travels are made by public transport. The public transport modifications consist of the new metro line with eight stations and changes in the walking environment and bus services around the stations. We will look at the before-and-after differences in public transport use and health outcomes between elderly participants living in treatment neighbourhoods (400 m walking buffered areas of the new metro stations) and in control groups (living in comparable areas but unaffected by the new metro). Questionnaire-based baseline data were collected in 2019 before the COVID-19 pandemic, while some qualitative interviews are ongoing. Amid the pandemic, we conducted a quick telephone-based survey of COVID-19's potential impact on public transport use behaviours of our elderly cohort in September 2020. Note there is no lockdown in Hong Kong until the writing of the paper (January 2021). After the new metro opens, we will conduct a follow-up survey, tentatively in late 2022. We aim to investigate if the new metro and the associated changes in the built environment have any effects on public transport use behaviours, physical activity and wider health outcomes among the elderly (eg, social inclusion, quality of life, subjective well-being). ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The Human Research Ethics Committee of the University of Hong Kong reviewed and approved the study procedures and materials (reference number: EA1710040). Results will be communicated through scientific papers and research reports.","Sun, Guibo; Du, Yao; Ni, Michael Y; Zhao, Jianting; Webster, Chris",BMJ Open,,518
429051,[Lung ultrasound in patients with symptoms of covid-19],2021,"In this paper, we provide a column generation-based approach for solving the airport flight-to-gate assignment problem, where the goal is to minimize the on-ground portion of arrival delays by optimally assigning each scheduled flight to a compatible gate. Specifically, we use a set covering formulation for the master problem and decompose the pricing problem such that each gate is the basis for an independent pricing problem to be solved for assignment patterns with negative reduced costs. We use a combination of an approximation algorithm based on the submodularity of the underlying set and dynamic programming algorithms to solve the independent pricing problems. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first use of submodularity property to efficiently solve pricing problems and improve the performance of column generation algorithm. We show that the dynamic programming algorithm is pseudo-polynomial when there are integer inputs. We also design and employ a rolling horizon method and block decomposition algorithm to solve large-sized instances. Finally, we perform extensive computational experiments to validate the performance of our approach.","Li, Yijiang; Clarke, John-Paul; Dey, Santanu",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.05894v3.pdf,518
429052,[Lung ultrasound in patients with symptoms of covid-19],2021,"The concept of evaluation gaps captures potential discrepancies between what researchers value about their research, in particular research quality, and what metrics measure. The existence of evaluation gaps can give rise to questions about the relationship between intrinsic and extrinsic motivations to perform research, i.e. how field-specific notions of quality compete with notions captured via evaluation metrics, and consequently how researchers manage the balancing act between intrinsic values and requirements of evaluation procedures. This study analyses the evaluation gap from a rational choice point of view for the case of observational astronomers, based on a literature review and 19 semi-structured interviews with international astronomers. By taking a close look at the role of institutional norms and different forms of capital - such as funding, publication rates and granted telescope time - at play in astronomy, light can be shed on the workings of the balance act and its consequences on research quality in astronomy. We find that astronomers experience an anomie; they want to follow their intrinsic motivation to pursue science in order to push knowledge forward, while at the same time following their extrinsic motivation to comply with institutional norms. The balance act is the art of serving performance indicators in order to stay in academia, while at the same time compromising research quality as little as possible. Gaming strategies shall give the appearance of compliance, while institutionalised means how to achieve a good bibliometric record are used in innovative ways, such as salami slicing or going for easy publications. This leads to an overall decrease in research quality.","Heuritsch, Julia",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.03068v1.pdf,518

RECENT FINDINGS: Overdose due to illicit synthetic opioids (e.g. fentanyl and fentanyl analogs) continues to rise in the US both preceding and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Fentanyl-related overdose is rising in new geographic areas e.g. the western USA. Stimulant-related overdose is also increasing nationwide driven by methamphetamine and cocaine. Polysubstance use, e.g. the use of a stimulant along with an opioid is driving stimulant-related overdose. Other medical consequences of injection drug use are rising including HIV and hepatitis C infections. Medication approaches to treating opioid use disorder remain the standard of care and there are new promising pharmacological approaches to treating methamphetamine use disorder. SUMMARY: A 'fourth wave' of high mortality involving methamphetamine and cocaine use has been gathering force in the USA. Availability and use of illicit fentanyls are still the major drivers of overdose deaths and the current rise in stimulant-related deaths appears entwined with the ongoing opioid epidemic.","Ciccarone, Daniel",Curr Opin Psychiatry,,518
432023,Not all ground-glass opacifications reflect COVID-19: The hidden danger of a pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic exposes individuals not only to health-related risks, but also to psychosocial fear and acute stress. Previous studies reveal that individuals who experienced child abuse (CA), especially those who suffer from complex posttraumatic stress disorder (CPTSD), are at a higher risk of reacting with fear and stress when faced with stressful life-events. OBJECTIVE: To test whether exposure to CA is implicated in a higher risk of COVID-19-related fear and acute stress, and whether CPTSD intervenes in such processes. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTINGS: A convenience sample of 837 adults participated in the study during the first peak of COVID-19 in Israel. METHODS: Participants completed self-report questionnaires, assessing child physical, sexual and emotional abuse, CPTSD (ITQ), COVID-19-related acute stress disorder (COVID-19 ASD; ASDS) and fear of COVID-19. RESULTS: Bivariate analyses showed that participants who experienced CA were higher than participants who did not experience CA in COVID-19 ASD (p = .032), but not in fear of COVID-19 (p = .65). Mediation analyses demonstrated two significant paths: in the first, CA was associated with elevated fear of COVID-19 (effect = .061, .059; p < 0.05) and COVID-19 ASD (effect = .14, .084; p < 0.05) through the mediation of CPTSD; in the second path, when controlling for the mediation of CPTSD, CA was associated with reduced fear of COVID-19 (effect = -.15; p = 0.001), and COVID-19 ASD (effect = -.12; p = 0.024). CONCLUSIONS: The findings reveal a complex pattern, indicating that CPTSD may be a risk factor for elevated levels of COVID-19 distress among individuals who experienced CA.

432611,[Progression of dyspnea in COVID-19 patients: now what?],2020,"As clinicians and support personnel struggle with their responsibilities to treat during the current COVID-19 pandemic, several ethical issues have emerged. Will healthcare workers and support staff fulfill their duty to treat in the face of high risks? Will institutional and government leaders at all levels do the right things to help alleviate healthcare workers risks and fears? Will physicians be willing to make hard, resource-allocation decisions if they cannot first husband or improvise alternatives?With our healthcare facilities and governments unprepared for this inevitable disaster, front-line doctors, advanced providers, nurses, EMS, and support personnel struggle with acute shortages of equipment-both to treat patients and protect themselves. With their personal and possibly their family's lives and health at risk, they must weigh the option of continuing to work or retreat to safety. This decision, made daily, is based on professional and personal values, how they perceive existing risks-including available protective measures, and their perception of the level and transparency of information they receive. Often, while clinicians get this information, support personnel do not, leading to absenteeism and deteriorating healthcare services. Leadership can use good risk communication (complete, widely transmitted, and transparent) to align healthcare workers' risk perceptions with reality. They also can address the common problems healthcare workers must overcome to continue working (ie, risk mitigation techniques). Physicians, if they cannot sufficiently husband or improvise lifesaving resources, will have to face difficult triage decisions. Ideally, they will use a predetermined plan, probably based on the principles of Utilitarianism (maximizing the greatest good) and derived from professional and community input. Unfortunately, none of these plans is optimal.","Iserson, Kenneth V",West J Emerg Med,,518

441005,A comprehensive review of imaging findings in COVID-19 - status in early 2021,2021,"The innate immune system has evolved mechanisms to keep the viral infection under control and repair damaged tissues. Several pathways can identify the presence of pathogenic components, such as viral nucleic acids and viral proteins. Also, the innate immune system can detect cellular and tissue perturbations caused by infections. Inflammasomes are cellular pieces of machinery that can detect a pathogen's presence and its possible impact on cellular integrity. Thereby several inflammasomes, including the NLRP3 inflammasome and the AIM2 inflammasome, contribute to antiviral innate immunity. Inflammation driven by inflammasomes promotes immune defenses and initiate repair mechanisms. However, its overactivation may trigger acute inflammatory responses that may harm the host. This pathologic activation could contribute to the hyperinflammatory response observed in patients infected with viruses, including influenza, SARS, and possibly SARS-CoV2.","Spel, Lotte; Martinon, Fabio",Curr Opin Virol,,518

This proof-of-principle study targets PPI between linear ubiquitin chains and NEMO UBAN domain, which activates NF-&#954;B signaling. Using phage display, we generated ubiquitin variants that bind to the functional UBAN epitope with high affinity, act as competitive inhibitors, and structurally maintain the existing PPI interface.

445837,The role of children in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2,2020,"Sequence learning is the cognitive faculty enabling everyday skill acquisition. In the lab, it is typically measured in speed of response to sequential stimuli, whereby faster responses are taken to indicate improved anticipation. However, response speed is an indirect measure of anticipation, that can provide only limited information on underlying processes. As a result, little is known about what is learned during sequence learning, and how that unfolds over time. In this work, eye movements that occurred before targets appeared on screen in an ocular serial reaction time (O-SRT) task provided an online indication of where participants anticipated upcoming targets. When analyzed in the context of the stimuli preceding them, oculomotor anticipations revealed several simultaneous learning processes. These processes influenced each other, as learning the task grammar facilitated acquisition of the target sequence. However, they were dissociable, as the grammar was similarly learned whether a repeating sequence inhabited the task or not. Individual differences were found in how the different learning processes progressed, allowing for similar performance to be produced for different latent reasons. This study provides new insights into the processes subserving sequence learning, and a new method for high-resolution study of it.","Tal, Amir; Bloch, Ayala; Cohen-Dallal, Haggar; Aviv, Or; Schwizer Ashkenazi, Simone; Bar, Moshe; Vakil, Eli",Sci Rep,,518

RESULT: Carbohydrate consumption and frequency of snacking increased in 21% and 23% patients, respectively. Interestingly, 27% patients reported an increase in consumption of fruits. Exercise duration was reduced in 42% and weight gain occurred in 19% patients. Frequency of doing self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) was decreased in 23% patients. 'Mental stress' of any kind was reported in 87% patients. Availability of medicines and insulin was uninterrupted in 91% patients. Knowledge about telemedicine was present in 69% and majority (92%) of these patients preferred video consultation. CONCLUSION: During 45 days of lockdown increase in carbohydrate intake, decrease in exercise, decreased SMBG and widespread mental stress in patients with T2DM was recorded, factors which may destabilize or exacerbate hyperglycemia and hypertension. Some positive changes (e.g. increased intake of fruits) were also observed.","Ghosh, Amerta; Arora, Bhavya; Gupta, Ritesh; Anoop, Shajith; Misra, Anoop",Diabetes Metab Syndr,,518

448224,"HIV Glasgow - Virtual, 5-8 October 2020",2020,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 pandemic started in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Although there are some doubts about the reporting of cases and deaths in China, it seems that this country was able to control the epidemic more effectively than many other countries. In this paper, we would like to analyze the measures taken in China and compare them with other countries in order to find out what they can learn from China. METHODS: We develop a system dynamics model of the COVID-19 pandemic in Wuhan. Based on a number of simulations we analyze the impact of changing parameters, such as contact rates, on the development of a second wave. RESULTS: Although China's health care system seems to be poorly financed and inefficient, the epidemic was brought under control in a comparably short period of time and no second wave was experienced in Wuhan until today. The measures to contain the epidemic do not differ from what was implemented in other countries, but China applied them very early and rigorously. For instance, the consequent implementation of health codes and contact-tracking technology contributed to contain the disease and effectively prevented the second and third waves. CONCLUSIONS: China's success in fighting COVID-19 is based on a very strict implementation of a set of measures, including digital management. While other countries discuss relaxing the lock-down at a rate of 50 per 100,000 inhabitants, China started local lock-downs at a rate of 3 per 100,000. We call for a public debate whether this policy would be feasible for more liberal countries as well.","Wang, Mei Mei; Fleßa, Steffen",Health Econ Rev,,518
448225,"HIV Glasgow - Virtual, 5-8 October 2020",2020,"The existence of the Coronavirus outbreak hampers teaching and learning activities that usually take place face-to-face. The learning system is carried out remotely by utilizing information technology. One of the big challenges in implementing the distance learning model is that the academic community is not yet accustomed to using a blended and online learning system. Teaching lecturers must pay attention to student learning styles because in each teaching, their effectiveness will closely match the student's learning method or style, in addition to their personal characteristics and intellectual abilities. Lecturers' lack of understanding of learning styles has a negative impact on students. The purpose of this study was to examine the learning styles of students of the Faculty of Economics, University of Semarang in a bold manner. This study used a descriptive research design. The population in this study were all 500 USM FE students who took sports courses in the odd semester of 2020/2021, aged 18-25 years. Sampling in this study using total sampling. The data analysis technique in this research is descriptive statistical analysis method. The result of this research is that the learning style of FE USM students has the highest kinesthetic, namely 40.8%, the second is visual as much as 33.8%, the third is auditory as much as 25.4%. Many students prefer an online lecture system by actively viewing, listening and doing direct question and answer with the lecturer, which is 41.2%. The suggestion that can be given is that the lecturers should increase the proportion of teaching the online system with live video, audio, display material and do direct question and answer. Systems with only live audio and display only material should be greatly reduced since few people like them.","Christiana, Metta; Muhaimin, Ahmad; en,",Jurnal Dinamika Sosial Budaya,,518

Currently, only symptomatic relief has been provided by FDA-approved therapeutic approaches for Parkinson's disease (PD). The present study aims to evaluate the potential of wedelolactone (WDL), a natural occurring coumestan found in Eclipta alba to mitigate the parkinsonism in Caenorhabditis elegans disease model. In the present studies, supplementation with 37.5 µM WDL exhibited a reduction in the level of &#945;-syn in an age-dependent manner (22% at day 5, p < 0.05; and 16% at day 10, p < 0.001, n = 30), along with improvement in neuronal health through basal movement, and elevated the dopamine levels evident through 1-nonanol repulsion results in wild-type and diseased worms. Moreover, WDL augmented the mitochondrial health in wild-type, PD-diseased, and mev-1 mutant worms that establish the inherent activity of WDL in the alleviation of oxidative stress. Furthermore, WDL supplementation significantly decreases the neutral lipid and triglyceride level and also alleviates protein carbonyl level in PD disease condition. The overall investigation will provide a pioneer to the future insights of PD research related to plant-based drugs. qPCR studies after WDL supplementation revealed alteration of genes involved in the regulation of various stress-responsive (sod-5, gst-4, skn-1), &#945;-syn-suppressing (lrk-1, ymel-1, lagr-1, grk-1), and mitochondrial (pink-1) genes. All together, these findings support that the WDL is a promising candidate to combat age-related multi-factorial PD pathology associated with protein misfolding and accumulation. The results provide sufficient information in the development of therapeutic medicines from natural products for improving the health.","Sharma, Shruti; Trivedi, Shalini; Pandey, Taruna; Ranjan, Sachin; Trivedi, Mashu; Pandey, Rakesh",Mol.

Drawing upon the Understanding Society COVID-19 survey, this study investigated the trajectory of loneliness in young adults (aged 18-25) from June to November 2020 and its association with emotional support as well as demographic and health factors. The analytic sample included 419 young adults (296 females; 123 males). Growth curve modelling revealed a U-shape longitudinal trend in self-reported loneliness, with a sharp rise during the winter months under the national lockdown. Young adults with long-standing physical or mental health conditions were more likely to report feeling lonely. Those with a lower household income and who were unemployed or not in school reported higher levels of loneliness. Gender was found to moderate the association between self-reported emotional support and loneliness. While greater emotional support was associated with less loneliness in males, no association was shown for females. The current findings add to our understanding of how the pandemic has affected the mental health of young adults and the differential effect of emotional support as a potential coping strategy for males and females.","Hu, Yanran; Gutman, Leslie Morrison",Psychiatry Res,,518

Through Epic Signal, we collected data regarding the actions logged in the EHR by health care providers of the Montefiore Health System (Bronx, NY) before and after the implementation of telemedicine during the pandemic. Focusing on five metrics (appointments per day, visits closed same day, time spent outside 7 AM-7 PM, time spent on unscheduled days, and pajama time), we performed a preliminary analysis of providers across the institution, by specialty, and according to demographic characteristics such as gender and years since graduation. We observed that after telemedicine implementation, a greater proportion of providers had fewer appointments per day, closed more notes same day, and spent less time in the EHR outside of normal working hours for each of the time-related metrics. We additionally found that providers who graduated longer ago as well as female providers spent more time documenting in the EHR after hours.

The dynamics of SW-GW interactions may depend on factors such as the relative water levels between streams and aquifers, resulting in a temporal variation of exchange, which imposes complexity to the understanding of such dynamics. This study highlights the use of high-resolution time series and multi-resolution analysis to help to gain insights into such complex dynamics. Wavelet coherence (WTC) is applied on hourly time series of rainfall, stream and spring discharges of a low lying karstified spring catchment to yield a correlation in the time-frequency domain. This analysis provides comprehensive information on the overall impact of the river on the spring, which is supported by the cross-correlation function, as well as by more detailed information, including time-variant influences such as a threshold level of influence. Field observations of turbidity sampling at the spring appear to support this interpretation. This innovative approach relies on basic hydrological parameters, water level or discharge, and is therefore applicable to many other systems with such existing time series.

473984,Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine for COVID-19: no evidence of effectiveness,2020,"Several recent literature reports regarding the flushing technique of TIVADs highlight how the definition of the optimal flushing interval is still a source of controversy. Several recent studies indicate more and more frequently how 4 weeks can be considered a too short interval for the flushing of a totally implantable access device (TIVAD); on the other hand most of the main guidelines and instructions for use provided by the device's manufacturers still suggest an interval between 4 weeks and 1 month as the ideal one. The recent meta-analysis by Wu et al. on this topic, promotes an important strategy change, indicating the possibility of extending the flushing intervals at least up to 8 weeks. This editorial extensively discusses the flushing methods of TIVADs highlighting the need for important and substantial changes, both in extending the range of flushes and in the solutions and methods to be used. It represents an invitation to the scientific community and device manufacturers for a complete revision of the indications on flushing techniques.","Bertoglio, Sergio",J Vasc Access,,518

Apart from the determinants of drug initiation established in numerous studies, the authors wish to draw attention to other equally important factors, which may contribute to augmenting this phenomenon. The article aims to draw attention to the content of mass culture, especially representations of drug use in mass media, which may influence the liberalization of attitudes towards drugs and their use. The role of mass culture and its impact on the audience is discussed. It presents an overview of drug representations in the content of mass culture, e.g., in film, music, literature, and the occurrence of drug references in everyday products, e.g., food, clothes, and cosmetics. Attention was drawn to liberal attitudes of celebrities and their admissions to drug use, particularly to the impact of the presented positions on the attitudes of the audience, especially young people for whom musicians, actors, and celebrities are regarded as authorities. Indications for further preventive actions were also presented. Attention was drawn to the need to take appropriate action due to the time of the COVID-19 pandemic when many people staying at home (due to lockdown or quarantine) have the possibility of much more frequent contact with mass culture content, which may distort the image of drugs.","Motyka, Marek A; Al-Imam, Ahmed",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,518

514980,FDG-PET/CT imaging during the Covid-19 emergency: a southern Italian perspective,2020,"The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is one of the oldest hormone systems in vertebrate phylogeny. RAS was initially related to regulation of blood pressure and sodium and water homeostasis. However, local or paracrine RAS were later identified in many tissues, including brain, and play a major role in their physiology and pathophysiology. In addition, a major component, ACE2, is the entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Overactivation of tissue RAS leads several oxidative stress and inflammatory processes involved in aging-related degenerative changes. In addition, a third level of RAS, the intracellular or intracrine RAS (iRAS), with still unclear functions, has been observed. The possible interaction between the intracellular and extracellular RAS, and particularly the possible deleterious or beneficial effects of the iRAS activation are controversial. The dopaminergic system is particularly interesting to investigate the RAS as important functional interactions between dopamine and RAS have been observed in the brain and several peripheral tissues. Our recent observations in mitochondria and nucleus of dopaminergic neurons may clarify the role of the iRAS. This may be important for the developing of new therapeutic strategies, since the effects on both extracellular and intracellular RAS must be taken into account, and perhaps better understanding of COVID-19 cell mechanisms.","Labandeira-Garcia, Jose L; Valenzuela, Rita; Costa-Besada, Maria A; Villar-Cheda, Begoña; Rodriguez-Perez, Ana I",Prog Neurobiol,,518

The study was designed to examine the accuracy of the digital impression (DI) of multiple implants with an intraoral scanner (IOS) and compared with that of a conventional impression (CI). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Four dental implants were placed in teeth area #33, #36, #43 and 46# of the mandibular full-arch model. The implanted model was replicated by IOS and CI after fitting of scannable abutments over the implant screws. Then, a small hole was made on the scan region (as a reference point). Two types of CI techniques were used; dual-phase (DP) and monophase (MP). Stone casts were produced through a conventional close tray impression technique using die stone. The casts were scanned with a laboratory scanner. DI was attained by scanning the implanted model with the IOS. The control sample was accomplished by scanning the implanted model directly with a laboratory scanner. Dimensional accuracy was calculated by measuring the distances between the reference points of four measuring parameters as follows; A-B, B-C, C-D, and A-D using CAD software. RESULTS: The mean values and standard deviation between the four parameters of different impression techniques (CI and DI) and the control group showed convergent value. One-way ANOVA test showed all CI techniques, except IOS, showed a significant differences from the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with CI, the IOS was more accurate because no differences were observed between its measurements and those of the control model. CI is simple and reduces patient discomfort when used in fabricating multiple implants and allowing communication with dental technicians.

620739,"Hepatitis B vaccination status and knowledge, attitude, and practice regarding Hepatitis B among preclinical medical students of a medical college in Nepal",2020-11-23,"BACKGROUND: Lack of training is currently the most common barrier to implementation of point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) use in clinical practice, and in-person POCUS continuing medical education (CME) courses have been paramount in improving this training gap. Due to travel restrictions and physical distancing requirements during the COVID-19 pandemic, most in-person POCUS training courses were cancelled. Though tele-ultrasound technology has existed for several years, use of tele-ultrasound technology to deliver hands-on training during a POCUS CME course has not been previously described. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective observational study comparing educational outcomes, course evaluations, and learner and faculty feedback from in-person versus tele-ultrasound POCUS courses. The same POCUS educational curriculum was delivered to learners by the two course formats. Data from the most recent pre-pandemic in-person course were compared to tele-ultrasound courses during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Pre- and post-course knowledge test scores of learners from the in-person (n = 88) and tele-ultrasound course (n = 52) were compared. Though mean pre-course knowledge test scores were higher among learners of the tele-ultrasound versus in-person course (78% vs. 71%; p = 0.001), there was no significant difference in the post-course test scores between learners of the two course formats (89% vs. 87%; p = 0.069). Both learners and faculty rated the tele-ultrasound course highly (4.6–5.0 on a 5-point scale) for effectiveness of virtual lectures, tele-ultrasound hands-on scanning sessions, and course administration. Faculty generally expressed less satisfaction with their ability to engage with learners, troubleshoot image acquisition, and provide feedback during the tele-ultrasound course but felt learners completed the tele-ultrasound course with a better basic POCUS skillset. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to a traditional in-person course, tele-ultrasound POCUS CME courses appeared to be as effective for improving POCUS knowledge post-course and fulfilling learning objectives. Our findings can serve as a roadmap for educators seeking guidance on development of a tele-ultrasound POCUS training course whose demand will likely persist beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.

There is presently a lack of in-depth qualitative research exploring how these changes have affected parents mental health and wellbeing. Methods Semi-structured qualitative interviews with 29 parents of young children. Interviews were analysed using reflexive thematic analysis. Results We identified five superordinate themes affecting participant mental health and wellbeing: 1) navigation of multiple responsibilities and change inside the home; 2) disruption to home life; 3) changes to usual support networks; 4) changes in personal relationships; and 5) use of coping strategies. Participants described stress and exhaustion from navigating multiple pressures and conflicting responsibilities with home, schooling, and work, without their usual support networks and in the context of disrupted routines. Family roles and relationships were sometimes tested, however, many parents identified coping strategies that protected their wellbeing including access to outdoor space, spending time away from family, and avoiding conflict and pandemic-related media coverage. Conclusions Employers must be cognisant of the challenges that the pandemic has placed on parents, particularly women and lone parents. Flexible working arrangements and support might therefore relieve stress and increase productivity. Coping strategies identified by parents in this study could be harnessed and encouraged by employers and policymakers to promote positive wellbeing during times of stress throughout the pandemic and beyond.","Dawes, J.; May, T.; McKinlay, A.

Nosocomial infections predominate in patients who have undergone haematopoietic stem cell transplantation during the early post-engraftment period (30-100 days after the infusion); the incidence of infection is higher in graft-versus-host disease. Nodular lesions can appear in the lungs due to invasive fungal infection. A diffuse pattern is usually secondary to viral infection or P. jirovecii pneumonia. After the first 100 days a moderate risk of infection by conventional and opportunistic infections persists, such as late CMV infection. Advances in surgical techniques and the use of calcineurinics have reduced mortality from infections in recipients of solid organ transplantations. Nosocomial infections are common during the first month; opportunistic infections that are dependent on cellular immunity are more common between the first and the sixth month, from the sixth month the risk lowers and community-based infections similar to those of immunocompetent patients predominate.","Ramos Martínez, A.; Pintos Pascual, I.; Múñez Rubio, E.",Medicine (Madr),https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0304541218301045; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304541218301045,518
642503,Can opportunities from this crisis help to tackle another?,2020,"BACKGROUND: When an influenza pandemic occurs most of the population is susceptible and attack rates can range as high as 40–50 %. The most important failure in pandemic planning is the lack of standards or guidelines regarding what it means to be ‘prepared’. The aim of this study was to assess the preparedness of acute hospitals in the Republic of Ireland for an influenza pandemic from an infection control perspective. METHODS: This was a cross sectional study involving a questionnaire completed by infection control nurses, time period from June – July 2013, (3 weeks) from acute public and private hospitals in the Republic of Ireland. A total of 46 out of 56 hospitals responded to the questionnaire. RESULTS: From a sample of 46 Irish hospitals, it was found that Irish hospitals are not fully prepared for an influenza pandemic despite the 2009 Influenza A (H1N1) pandemic. In 2013, thirty five per cent of Irish hospitals have participated in an emergency plan or infectious disease exercise and have plans or been involved in local planning efforts to care for patients at non-health care facilities. Sixty per cent of Irish hospitals did not compile or did not know if the hospital had compiled a “lessons learned” from any exercise that were then used to revise emergency response plans. Fifty two per cent of hospitals have sufficient airborne isolation capacity to address routine needs and have an interim emergency plan to address needs during an outbreak. Fifty one percent of hospitals have taken specific measures to stockpile or have reserve medical supplies e.g. masks, ventilators and linen. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study carried out in the Republic of Ireland investigating the current preparedness for an influenza pandemic from an infection control perspective. Deficits exist in the provision of emergency planning committees, testing of emergency plans, airborne isolation facilities, stockpiling of personal protective equipment (PPE) and medical supplies and organisational schemes/incentives for healthcare workers to continue to work in a pandemic. While Irish standards are comparable to findings from international studies, the health care service needs to continue to enhance preparedness for an influenza pandemic and implement standard preparedness guidance for all Irish hospitals.","Reidy, Mary; Ryan, Fiona; Hogan, Dervla; Lacey, Sean; Buckley, Claire",BMC Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26335570/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-015-2025-6,518

The lung lesions may involute rapidly during the course. The patient showed improvement both clinically and on computed tomography imaging at discharged after 2 weeks’ treatment. Computed tomography scans of patients helped monitor the changes continuously, which could timely provide the information of the evolution of the disease or therapeutic effect to clinicians.","Han, Xiaoyu; Fan, Yanqing; Wan, Yung-Liang; Shi, Heshui",J Thorac Imaging,https://doi.org/10.1097/rti.0000000000000506; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32168162/,518
