15660,Factors Affecting Social Media Users’ Emotions Regarding Food Safety Issues: Content Analysis of a Debate among Chinese Weibo Users on Genetically Modified Food Security,2021-01-21,"Chronic inflammation and increased oxidative stress are contributing factors to many non-communicable diseases. A growing body of evidence indicates that dietary nutrients can activate the immune system and may lead to the overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Fatty acids as macronutrients are key players for immunomodulation, with n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids having the most beneficial effect, while polyphenols and carotenoids seem to be the most promising antioxidants. Psoriasis is a chronic, immune-mediated inflammatory disease with multifactorial etiology. Obesity is a major risk factor for psoriasis, which leads to worse clinical outcomes. Weight loss interventions and, generally, dietary regimens such as gluten-free and Mediterranean diet or supplement use may potentially improve psoriasis’ natural course and response to therapy. However, data about more sophisticated nutritional patterns, such as ketogenic, very low-carb or specific macro- and micro-nutrient substitution, are scarce. This review aims to present the effect of strictly structured dietary nutrients, that are known to affect glucose/lipid metabolism and insulin responses, on chronic inflammation and immunity, and to discuss the utility of nutritional regimens as possible therapeutic tools for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.","Katsimbri, Pelagia; Korakas, Emmanouil; Kountouri, Aikaterini; Ikonomidis, Ignatios; Tsougos, Elias; Vlachos, Dionysios; Papadavid, Evangelia; Raptis, Athanasios; Lambadiari, Vaia",Antioxidants (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7912156/,472
18791,Application of blended learning approach in clinical skills to stimulate active learning attitudes and improve clinical practice among medical students,2021-06-24,"INTRODUCTION: Esophagectomy is a major surgery with a high degree of catabolic and post-surgical inflammatory response accompanied by high morbidity and significant mortality. Post-surgical nutritional support via enteral administration of ω-3 fatty acids has been seen to be effective although its bad tolerance. There are few clinical trials with parenteral ω-3 fatty acids in these patients. We propose to investigate the effect of combining a parenteral fish oil lipid emulsion with the standard enteral nutrition (EN) support. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Prospective, single-center, randomized, double-blind study in esophagectomized patients, and treated after surgery with parenteral lipid emulsions of ω-3 fatty acids or a mixture of ω-6 long-chain triglycerides/short-chain triglycerides 50%. These emulsions will be added to the standard nutritional support in continuous infusion until 5 days of treatment have been completed. Patients will be randomized 1:1:1 in Group A receiving 0.4 g/kg/d of fish-oil lipid emulsion and 0.4 g/kg/d of a lipid emulsion mixture of ω-6 long-chain fatty acids (LCT) plus medium-chain fatty acids (MCT) (total dose of 0.8 g/kg/d of lipid emulsion); Group B receiving 0.8 g/kg/d of fish oil lipid emulsion and Group C receiving 0.8 g/kg/d of LCT/MCT emulsion. The main objective is to determine whether 5 days administration of intravenous ω-3 fatty acid lipid emulsion is effective in normalizing interleukin-6 levels compared with LCT/MCT emulsions, and whether a 0.8 g/kg/d dose is more effective than 0.4 g/kg/d. Secondary outcomes include other inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein, tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-10, and parameters of morbidity, safety, nutrition and mortality. Samples will be collected at the time when surgery is indicated and on days 0, 1, 3, 5 and 21 to determine inflammatory, nutritional, hepatic and safety parameters. In addition, clinical follow-up will be continued throughout the hospital admision and up to 1 year after surgery. DISCUSSION: Studies of ω-3 fatty acids administered parenterally in esophagectomized patients are scarce. This study proposes to investigate the effect of combining fish-oil lipid emulsions administered parenterally with EN support. Potential benefits include fast incorporation of lipids to the cellular membranes and to the inflammatory cascade, and the use of only 1 pharmaconutrient.

20365,Acute Mesenteric Vein Thrombosis in a Pregnant Patient at 10 Weeks Gestation: A Case Report,2021-07-27,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: YAP-TEAD protein-protein interaction is a crucial feature in the Hippo pathway for cancer therapeutics. In this study, to investigate novel YAP-TEAD protein-protein interaction inhibitors, the fragment molecular orbital method for hot spot analysis of YAP-TEAD PPI and FMO-based pharmacophore construction were introduced. We performed pharmacophore based virtual screening through an in-house library. Virtual hit compounds were derived, and the biological activity of the hit compounds was confirmed, through in vitro experiments. Finally, we proposed a compound BY03 as a novel promising PPI inhibitor for the YAP-TEAD interaction. ABSTRACT: The Hippo pathway is an important signaling pathway modulating growth control and cancer cell proliferation. Dysregulation of the Hippo pathway is a common feature of several types of cancer cells. The modulation of the interaction between yes-associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional enhancer associated domain (TEAD) in the Hippo pathway is considered an attractive target for cancer therapeutic development, although the inhibition of PPI is a challenging task. In order to investigate the hot spots of the YAP and TEAD1 interacting complex, an ab initio Fragment Molecular Orbital (FMO) method was introduced. With the hot spots, pharmacophores for the inhibitor design were constructed, then virtual screening was performed to an in-house library. Next, we performed molecular docking simulations and FMO calculations for screening results to study the binding modes and affinities between PPI inhibitors and TEAD1. As a result of the virtual screening, three compounds were selected as virtual hit compounds. In order to confirm their biological activities, cellular (luciferase activity, proximity ligation assay and wound healing assay in A375 cells, qRT-PCR in HEK 293T cells) and biophysical assays (surface plasmon resonance assays) were performed. Based on the findings of the study, we propose a novel PPI inhibitor BY03 and demonstrate a profitable strategy to analyze YAP–TEAD PPI and discover novel PPI inhibitors.","Kim, Jongwan; Lim, Hocheol; Moon, Sungho; Cho, Seon Yeon; Kim, Minhye; Park, Jae Hyung; Park, Hyun Woo; No, Kyoung Tai",Cancers (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8391968/,472

24313,Aircraft Environmental Control Systems,2005-08-08,"Recent structural studies on the astrovirus virion and viral proteins have yielded exciting new insights into the molecular mechanisms of the astrovirus life cycle. The 25 Å-resolution cryo-electron microscopy (Cryo-EM) reconstructions of the astrovirus virion reveal a solid capsid shell studded with spikes. Proteolytic maturation of the virus particle results in capsid conformational changes, most prominently at the spikes. High-resolution crystal structures of the human and avian astrovirus capsid spike domains have shed light on potential host receptors and species specificity. Together, both the structural studies on the astrovirus virion and capsid spike domains have revealed similarities to hepatitis E virus, suggesting an evolutionary relationship. The only other structural information on astrovirus is from the high-resolution crystal structure of the protease that is involved in nonstructural polyprotein processing. Overall, these structural studies have led a better understanding of the astrovirus life cycle, including astrovirus assembly, virus release, maturation, receptor binding, antibody neutralization, and nonstructural polyprotein processing.","Dubois, Rebecca M.; Dryden, Kelly A.; Yeager, Mark; Tao, Yizhi J.",Astrovirus Research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120587/,472
24808,Governance of Food Security in the 21(st) Century,2009,"Other writers have cataloged the many contributions to understanding and practice that disaster studies have produced over the years, many of them, and the earliest, coming from sociology. The Disaster Research Center at the University of Delaware was founded in 1963 by, and is still inhabited by sociologists, but has embraced an interdisciplinary approach over time, including core and affiliated faculty from English, history, political science, civil engineering, and environmental policy). My thoughts in this essay are not confined to the DRC’s corpus of work, but ‘disaster studies’ more broadly defined below. This said, the roots of disaster studies in sociology are deep, the classic Ur-source being an unpublished PhD study of the 1917 explosion in Halifax, Nova Scotia. This disaster continues to be a source of continuing research that provide lessons for our time. My own essay will mention some of these contributions, and they are truly something to celebrate; however, the central theme I will emphasize is what has been missed and could be added to the research agenda over the next decade or so. I employ an optical metaphor that has as much to do with philosophy of science (‘vision’ and Mao’s famous question, ‘Where do ideas come from?’) as it does with optics, optometry and the detailed application of methods at micro and macro scale. The lens is a remarkable human invention. Glass shaped and polished in one way opened up the microscopic world. Treated in another, the lens gave us the telescope. I will argue that politics – the creation, use and maintenance of power to influence other people and to control space and resources – has been a largely missing raw material, like glass, from which disaster studies could shape lenses for its own tools of inquiry. Consideration of power has not been totally missing. Yet lenses fashioned from an understanding of power have not been used sufficiently in a number of critical areas of research.","Wisner, Ben",Disaster Research and the Second Environmental Crisis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121247/,472

In a decentralized blockchain, the state of smart contracts is collaboratively maintained by a peer-to-peer network of mutually untrusted nodes, which collect from users a set of transactions (representing the required actions on contracts), and execute them in some order. Once this sequence of transactions is appended to the blockchain, the other nodes validate it, re-executing the transactions in the same order. The serial execution of transactions does not take advantage of the multi-core architecture of modern processors, so contributing to limit the throughput. In this paper we propose a true concurrent model of smart contracts execution. Based on this, we show how static analysis of smart contracts can be exploited to parallelize the execution of transactions.","Bartoletti, Massimo; Galletta, Letterio; Murgia, Maurizio",Coordination Models and Languages,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7282893/,472

The travel behavior and operations will not be the same as before due to requirements such as physical (social) distancing. This study analyzes the resulting shortage in supply of public transport (buses) that will likely widen the existing gap between demand and supply. In this work, system optimization models are developed to efficiently reallocate the bus fleet to routes for different levels of physical distancing gaps and travel demand. The proposed models are applied to a real-life network of 34 bus routes of Delhi, considering three types of scenarios: current, practical, and ideal. In the practical scenarios, the additional, idling bus fleets can be allocated to the routes efficiently while maintaining physical distancing. The results show that the Business-as-Usual (BAU) scenario involving the current allocation approach will make it impossible to use public buses even if the bare minimum physical distancing has to be maintained. Further, the models proposed in the study significantly improve the key performance indicators for all scenarios.","Suman, Hemant K.; Agarwal, Amit; Bolia, Nomesh B.",Trans Indian Natl,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7290149/,472

36370,Operational excellence for improving sustainable supply chain performance,2020-07-08,"Modern Operating Systems (OSs) enable user processes to obtain full access control over other processes initiated by the same user. In scenarios of sensitive security processes (e.g., antivirus software), protection schemes are enforced at the kernel level such as to confront arbitrary user processes overtaking with malicious intent. Within the Windows family of OSs, the kernel driver is notified via dedicated routines for user-mode processes that require protection. In such cases the kernel driver establishes a callback mechanism triggered whenever a handle request for the original user-mode process is initiated by a different user process. Subsequently, the kernel driver performs a selective permission removal process (e.g., read access to the process memory) prior to passing a handle to the requesting process. In this paper we are the first to demonstrate a fundamental user-mode process access control vulnerability, existing in Windows 7 up to the most recent Windows 10 OSs. We show that a user-mode process can indeed obtain a fully privileged access handle before the kernel driver is notified, thus prior to the callback mechanism establishment. Our study shows that this flaw can be exploited by a method to (i) disable the anti-malware suite Symantec Endpoint Protection; (ii) overtake VirtualBox protected processes; (iii) circumvent two major video game anti-cheat protection solutions, BattlEye and EasyAntiCheat.

An efficient method is presented in this paper to detect and extract Bangla texts from scene images based on a connected component approach along with rule-based filtering and vertical scanning scheme. Next, extracted characters are recognized by using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The method consists of the four basic consecutive steps such as detection and extraction of the Region of Interest (ROI), segmentation of the words, extraction of characters, and recognition of the extracted characters. After extracting the ROI from the input image, connected component(CC) analysis and bounding box technology are used for segmentation of Bangla words. To separate and extract Bangla characters from the segmented Bangla words, vertical scanning based method along with a dynamic threshold value has been applied. Finally, character recognition is carried out using CNN. The proposed algorithm is applied to 600 scene images of different writing styles and colors, and we have obtained 89.25% accuracy in text detection and 94.50% accuracy in the extraction of characters.

Tube formation was significantly increased in the overExp group compared with the empty vector-transfected control group (P<0.01). Tube formation was significantly decreased in the shPXN group compared with the PXN-NC group (P<0.01). In mice, blood corpuscles were significantly decreased in the shPXN group. PXN promoted the migration of endothelial cells and corneal angiogenesis. The results of the present study suggest a role for PXN in corneal angiogenesis and provide a theoretical basis and potential target for the treatment of corneal angiogenesis.","Yang, Wan-Ju; Yan, Jiang-Bo; Zhang, Li; Zhao, Fang; Mei, Zhong-Ming; Yang, Yan-Ning; Xiang, Yi; Xing, Yi-Qiao",Exp Ther Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7388276/,472

37943,Cyberattacks: a look at evidentiary thresholds in International Law,2020-08-17,"Non-determinism in a concurrent or distributed setting may lead to many different runs or executions of a program. This paper presents a method to reproduce a specific run for non-deterministic actor or active object systems. The method is based on recording traces of events reflecting local transitions at so-called stable states during execution; i.e., states in which local execution depends on interaction with the environment. The paper formalizes trace recording and replay for a basic active object language, to show that such local traces suffice to obtain global reproducibility of runs; during replay different objects may operate fairly independently of each other and in parallel, yet a program under replay has guaranteed deterministic outcome. We then show that the method extends to the other forms of non-determinism as found in richer active object languages. Following the proposed method, we have implemented a tool to record and replay runs, and to visualize the communication and scheduling decisions of a recorded run, for Real-Time ABS, a formally defined, rich active object language for modeling timed, resource-aware behavior in distributed systems.","Tveito, Lars; Johnsen, Einar Broch; Schlatte, Rudolf",Fundamental Approaches to Software Engineering,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7418128/,472

41444,Allowing for unemployment in productivity measurement,2020-11-02,"Understanding the process of producing creative responses to open-ended problems solved in small groups is important for many modern domains, like health care, manufacturing, education, banking, and investment. Some of the main theoretical challenges include characterizing and measuring the dynamics of responses, relating social and individual aspects in group problem solving, incorporating soft skills (e.g., experience, social aspects, and emotions) to the theory of decision making in groups, and understanding the evolution of processes guided by soft utilities (hard-to-quantify utilities), e.g., social interactions and emotional rewards. This paper presents a novel theoretical model (TM) that describes the process of solving open-ended problems in small groups. It mathematically presents the connection between group member characteristics, interactions in a group, group knowledge evolution, and overall novelty of the responses created by a group as a whole. Each member is modeled as an agent with local knowledge, a way of interpreting the knowledge, resources, social skills, and emotional levels associated to problem goals and concepts. Five solving strategies can be employed by an agent to generate new knowledge. Group responses form a solution space, in which responses are grouped into categories based on their similarity and organized in abstraction levels. The solution space includes concrete features and samples, as well as the causal sequences that logically connect concepts with each other. The model was used to explain how member characteristics, e.g., the degree to which their knowledge is similar, relate to the solution novelty of the group. Model validation compared model simulations against results obtained through behavioral experiments with teams of human subjects, and suggests that TMs are a useful tool in improving the effectiveness of small teams.","Doboli, Alex; Doboli, Simona",Appl Intell,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7588593/,472

Cardiogenic shock is a state of pump failure which results in tissue hypoperfusion and its associated complications. There are a wide variety of causes which lead to this deranged physiology, and one such important and common scenario is the post-cardiotomy state which is encountered in cardiac surgical units. Veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) is an important modality of managing post-cardiotomy cardiogenic shock with variable outcomes which would otherwise be universally fatal. VA-ECMO is considered as a double-edged sword with the advantages of luxurious perfusion while providing an avenue for the failing heart to recover, but with the problems of anticoagulation, inflammatory and adverse systemic effects. Optimal outcomes after VA-ECMO are heavily reliant on a multitude of factors and require a multi-disciplinary team to handle them. This article aims to provide an insight into the pathophysiology of VA-ECMO, cannulation techniques, commonly encountered problems, monitoring, weaning strategies and ethical considerations along with a literature review of current evidence-based practices.","Patangi, Sanjay Orathi; Shetty, Riyan Sukumar; Shanmugasundaram, Balasubramanian; Kasturi, Srikanth; Raheja, Shivangi",Indian J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7647874/,472

44069,509. Comparision of CD4+ T Cells in Patients with Severe vs Critical COVID -19,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: There are limited data on the disease course of COVID-19 among children with HIV and among HIV-exposed infants. It is sensible to maximize the preventive effort against SARS-CoV-2 infections in this group of patients using harm reduction strategies and positive behaviors provided by medical providers. METHODS: A quality improvement project was started in the 2(nd) week of April in our Children’s Hospital Subspecialty Clinic caring for children with HIV and HIV-exposed infants on antiretroviral therapy (ART). All patients are offered Telehealth at baseline and at 4 weeks after interventions making sure they remain adherent to their ART, with enough supply of ART for 4 weeks, and discussed harm reduction strategies (hand washing, use of hand sanitizer & face mask, social distancing, shelter-at-home) via telehealth and video clips. The goal was an increase of hand hygiene performance by 25% at 4 weeks after interventions. The number of hand washing and hand sanitizer use per day was categorized as < 5, 5–10, and >10 per day and was analyzed by Cochran-Armitage test for trend. Adherence to ART was categorized as < 50%, 50–90%, >90–100% per week. RESULTS: There are 19 patients included: 11 with HIV infections (9–20 yo) and 8 HIV-exposed infants (2 weeks-6 months old), where parents received the intervention. At baseline, 32% of the participants washed hands >10 times a day, which increased to 71% after intervention (p value: 0.013). While 21% of participants washed hands < 5 times a day at baseline, all participants washed their hands 5 times or more after the intervention. Sanitizer use of >10 times a day increased from 21% to 43% (p value: 0.026). (Fig. 1 and 2) This was notable increase, as 47% used hand sanitizers < 5 times a day pre-intervention. No one was diagnosed with COVID-19, and all remained asymptomatic at 4-week follow up. All children with HIV remained adherent (>90–100% per week) to their ART. [Image: see text] [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: The degree of hand hygiene among children with HIV and HIV-exposed infants was increased 4 weeks after the intervention consisting of harm reduction strategies and positive behaviors by medical providers. All patients remained healthy and adherent to ART 4 weeks after the project began. COVID-19 pandemic is an opportunity for impactful health education that can positively affect the patients’ life.

Acute UTI constitutes a significant health burden in outpatient pediatrics affecting ~2.8% of children every year. Antibiotics are often started empirically when diagnosing UTI making pediatric UTIs an ideal target for outpatient stewardship. The primary objective was to reduce the use of broad-spectrum empiric antibiotics with a secondary objective to study antibiotic discontinuation in culture negative cases. METHODS: The electronic medical records of two pediatric practices were screened for patients aged 2 months to 18 years diagnosed with uncomplicated UTI using ICD-10 codes N39, R30 and R35. The definition of a positive urine culture was > 50,000 CFU/ml if catheterized and > 100,000 CFU/ml if clean-catch specimen. A two-year pre-intervention period began in January 2018. An audit and review of urine culture processes were studied at each site with a subsequent educational intervention, a direct, one-hour session focused on the use of cephalexin as first-line empiric therapy based on the local antibiogram. The post-intervention period began at each site after the intervention. A COVID-19 sub-analysis was performed for the post-intervention period. RESULTS: During the study, 515 encounters and 113 encounters were included during the pre- and post-intervention periods, respectively. 74.4% (383/515) of pre-intervention encounters had empirically prescribed antibiotics; higher-generation cephalosporins (i.e. cefdinir, cefprozil) most frequently. Antibiotics were empirically prescribed in 75.2% (85/113) of post-intervention encounters with a statistically significant increase in cephalexin use (32/85, 37.6%, p < 0.01) and reduction in higher-generation cephalosporin use (p < 0.01), Figure 1. In the COVID-19 analysis, empiric antibiotic prescribing trended towards baseline as providers were relying largely on telemedicine, Figure 2. Figure 1: Empiric Antibiotic Prescribing Pre- and Post-InterventionF [Image: see text] Figure 2: Empiric Antibiotic Prescribing - % [Image: see text] Table 1: Pre- and Post-Intervention [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: The educational intervention was effective in changing antibiotic prescribing with an increased use of narrow spectrum antibiotics. This change waned without reinforcement and reliance on telemedicine during COVID-19. Antibiotic discontinuation in culture-negative cases remains an important area for improvement.

This study is the first attempt to verify the possibility of predicting familiar and unfamiliar brand purchases based on psychophysiological reactions to a retailer television advertisement measured by EEG, EDA and eye-tracking. The number of private label products chosen later served to assess the binary dependent variable. A logistic regression model (with a prediction rate of 61.2%) was applied to determine which psychophysiological variables explained the largest part of the variance of a final purchase decision. The results show that among various measures, only the electrodermal peaks per second were significant in predicting further purchase decisions. The decision to buy was also influenced by brand familiarity. The article concludes that EDA is an unobtrusive measure of emotion-related anticipation of significant outcomes, particularly for dynamic stimuli, as related to decision-making.","Garczarek-Bąk, Urszula; Szymkowiak, Andrzej; Gaczek, Piotr; Disterheft, Aneta",J Brand Manag,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7803297/,472

This optimization strategy is based on the use of efficient optimization tools in solving complex problems in which other strategies are not efficient. The mathematical modeling of epidemiological phenomena is a useful tool to predict the direction of a disease, as well as to adequately and timely manage the available resources and thus save as many lives as possible. This work uses a mathematical model formulation based on deterministic optimization developed in general algebraic modeling system (GAMS) environment. The main user interface has been developed in a Microsoft™ (MS) Excel worksheet, which is familiar to many users. The linking code to send values from MS Excel to GAMS has been programmed in visual basic for applications (VBA) and it uses GAMS data exchange (GDX) files. The proposed optimization methodology is applied to case studies based on data obtained from affected people by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

This paper contributes to this area of study by exploring the possibility of simultaneous relationships between households’ price expectations and incentive to maximise the size of housing services demanded also accounting for the supply side factors and regional perspective. The empirical estimation takes the form of a system of a two simultaneous equations model applying two stage least squares estimation technique. Cross sectional estimations utilise data extracted from the Israeli Longitudinal Panel Survey (LPS) data. Applying the best available proxy for households’ price expectations, calculated as the ratio between subjective dwelling valuations (LPS) and the estimated market value of the same properties, research has identified the interrelated factors that simultaneously influence householders’ price expectations and housing demand. Results offer conceptual and empirical advantages, highlighting the imperfect nature of the housing market, as reflected by the inseparability of bias in subjective valuations and housing decisions.","Koblyakova, Alla; Fleishman, Larisa; Furman, Orly",J Real Estate Finan Econ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7936606/,472

47152,A Public and Persuasive PhD: Reforming Doctoral Education in the Outreach-Focused University,2020-10-14,"Tobacco use is projected to kill 1 billion people in the 21st century. Tobacco Use Disorder (TUD) is one of the most common substance use disorders in the world. Evidence-based treatment of TUD is effective, but treatment accessibility remains very low. A dearth of specially trained clinicians is a significant barrier to treatment accessibility, even within systems of care that implement brief intervention models. The treatment of TUD is becoming more complex and tailoring treatment to address new and traditional tobacco products is needed. The Council for Tobacco Treatment Training Programs (Council) is the accrediting body for Tobacco Treatment Specialist (TTS) training programs. Between 2016 and 2019, n = 7761 trainees completed Council-accredited TTS training programs. Trainees were primarily from North America (92.6%) and the Eastern Mediterranean (6.1%) and were trained via in-person group workshops in medical and academic settings. From 2016 to 2019, the number of Council-accredited training programs increased from 14 to 22 and annual number of trainees increased by 28.5%. Trainees have diverse professional backgrounds and work in diverse settings but were primarily White (69.1%) and female (78.7%) located in North America. Nearly two-thirds intended to implement tobacco treatment services in their setting; two-thirds had been providing tobacco treatment for 1 year or less; and 20% were sent to training by their employers. These findings suggest that the training programs are contributing to the development of a new workforce of TTSs as well as the development of new programmatic tobacco treatment services in diverse settings. Developing strategies to support attendance from demographically and geographically diverse professionals might increase the proportion of trainees from marginalized groups and regions of the world with significant tobacco-related inequities.","Sheffer, Christine E.; Al-Zalabani, Abdulmohsen; Aubrey, Andrée; Bader, Rasha; Beltrez, Claribel; Bennett, Susan; Carl, Ellen; Cranos, Caroline; Darville, Audrey; Greyber, Jennifer; Karam-Hage, Maher; Hawari, Feras; Hutcheson, Tresza; Hynes, Victoria; Kotsen, Chris; Leone, Frank; McConaha, Jamie; McCary, Heather; Meade, Crystal; Messick, Cara; Morgan, Susan K.; Morris, Cindy W.; Payne, Thomas; Retzlaff, Jessica; Santis, Wendy; Short, Etta; Shumaker, Therese; Steinberg, Michael; Wendling, Ann",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7967787/,472

Risk, risk assessment, and uncertainty are distinguished and scrutinized, as are risk calculability and cultural perceptions of risk, and the actualization of risk into disaster examined. Beck’s arguments that staging is needed to translate scientific findings into popular understanding, and that climate risk is hard to stage, are evaluated. Common stagings are assessed: ‘scare’em to death’, dramatic iconic images, and presenting the climate crisis as opportunities. Beck’s staging framework is then turned right side up by investigating the more significant staging of safety and of discounting danger. Several strategies are examined: staging of faith in market miracles, of mitigation as a job killer, of fossil fuels as poverty reduction, of blamelessness, and of fossil-fuel critics as hypocrites.","Murphy, Raymond",The Fossil-Fuelled Climate Crisis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7972053/,472

Since any text is in a certain way a part of communicative situation of direct or mediated communication, in the process of teaching the creation of a written text, it is necessary to consider the peculiarities and structure of the communicative act of educational communication. When creating a text, individual communicative tactics – specific methods of expanding thoughts – can vary significantly and are determined both by the specifics of the task and by the skills of the author of the text. This article examines the use of the communicative approach in teaching the Russian language using the example of teaching communicative tactics to create descriptive texts. Findings: Teaching various communicative tactics to create descriptive texts (description of the most important features of an object; description based on the most distinctive feature that determines other qualities; approaching the subject gradually; using the effect of disappointed expectations, etc.) enables students to master the tools for creating educational texts of various types. The study and description of communicative strategies and tactics when generating a text, and, most importantly, their use in the practice of teaching the Russian language online contribute to the speech development of students.","Narushevich, Andrei G.",Modern Global Economic System: Evolutional Development vs,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7972266/,472

In such conditions, the education system should maintain stability, be sufficiently flexible in terms of teaching methods and technologies, as well as the management of processes. In the authors’ opinion, the most effective tool to manage reactively the learning process as a complex system is a feedback. In order that teachers have a real opportunity to control the quality of this process, it is necessary to identify objective criteria for the assessment of quality in the context of the differentiation of motivational attributes. In addition, this way provides for teaching staff a possibility to evaluate the effectiveness of a particular method to influence on the motivational criteria. As a case study, different student’s groups were selected to compare their involvement in the process with traditional and online forms of learning, their performance and the impact of the learning form on the projects quality prepared by students.","Makarova, Irina; Mavrin, Vadim; Buyvol, Polina; Mukhametdinov, Eduard; Magdin, Kirill; Gritsenko, Alexander",Reliability and Statistics in Transportation and Communication,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7972425/,472

Communicable diseases or infectious diseases are caused by interactions between two living organisms whereas non-communicable diseases are either hereditary or due to the living environment of animals. Animals are very susceptible to various types of infections and pathogens may live outside or inside their body very conveniently. Epidemic diseases affect animal herd, livestock and the leading cause of animal mortality which may result in significant losses to the agricultural economy. Animal diseases are a matter of concern due to the direct effect on the economy as well as the possibility of pathogen transmission in humans. The accurate detection of animal diseases is an important factor to control diseases in livestock and in wild animals. Disease diagnosis in animals is very challenging and based on the variety of examinations and tests. In this context, nano-biosensors exhibit better disease detection capacity than conventional methods. Nano-biosensors show high sensitivity, stability, reproducibility with a lower limit of detection. This chapter emphasized the insight of communicable and non-communicable animal diseases and their detection through nano-biosensing devices. Some important animal diseases are discussed along with a description of developed nano-biosensors for them.

Precise estimation of harvest time is a key knowledge for the supply chain and timely delivery to grocery stores. The current process relies on human agronomists, who visit orchards often and do the visual evaluation of number of fruits, their ripeness and expected time of harvest. In this paper, we propose a preliminary work for automation of the fruits’ evaluation process, using machine learning algorithms to evaluate pictures of the trees. For our current system we have used pictures – one picture per tree, to constitute the base for evaluation of each tree using multiple pictures and video captured by drones. In this paper, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used for fruit image classification based on ripeness stage of the fruits. Fruits classification was based on appropriate surface color and shape features and CNN was used to extract these features for classification. The model showed 96.43% accuracy. The ultimate goal of this work is to fully automate the process of orchard trees evaluation, including estimation of number of fruits on the tree (including non-visible ones), their ripeness and time of harvest to address the commercial market delivery planning requirements.","Chmaj, Grzegorz; Sharma, Saugat; Selvaraj, Henry","Proceedings of the 27th International Conference on Systems Engineering, ICSEng 2020",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7972558/,472

The use of micro-mobility vehicles is often adopted to reach areas with particular transit restrictions or to avoid the problem of parking and congestion on the roads. Although personal mobility vehicles (PMV) are characterized by a growing technology, they still have problems related to driving safety in shared road spaces, not only for the inadequacy of infrastructure but also for some regulatory deficiencies and user behaviour. The Italian legislation is very recent and regulates the operational characteristics of the various vehicles and limits their use to certain age groups and in some areas of the cities. The present work focuses on the analysis of the attitudes and perceptions of a sample of users using micro-mobility in the centre of Palermo, one of the metropolises of Southern Italy. The results were obtained by administering questionnaires to a sample of specific users and the data were studied through a bivariate statistical analysis that highlights the significance of the comparison between two variables. The sample was chosen in collaboration with an association of citizens that promotes group activities by moving with means of micro-mobility in Palermo. Several correlations between the variables were addressed and among these some socio-economic ones were related to the propensity to rent and the perception of safety during the use of PMVs in Palermo. From this comparison, conclusions and notes useful for further research steps emerge.","Campisi, Tiziana; Nahiduzzaman, Kh Md; Ticali, Dario; Tesoriere, Giovanni",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7978506/,472

In espousing this view, Luther, who was one of the first people to translate the Bible from Greek into another language, stood on firm biblical grounds. For the Semitic people of the biblical world, this causal connection had been self-evident as well. Diseases, plagues, catastrophes were the consequences of the sin that people commit. Ultimately, the intuition that evil is the result of sin is the basis for the adage that adversity causes people to pray: sooner or later, human beings will be confronted with the contingency of their own lives, which, in the Christian perspective, is rooted in the fact that creation has fallen into sin. This is why the idea that adversity causes people to pray is often trotted out in times of crisis even though it has long been empirically disproven.","Loffeld, Jan",The New Common,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7978749/,472

The elements of the underlying lifted analysis domain are tuples, which maintain one property per variant. Still, explicit property enumeration in tuples, one by one for all variants, immediately yields combinatorial explosion. This is particularly apparent in the case of program families that, apart from Boolean features, contain also numerical features with large domains, thus giving rise to astronomical configuration spaces. The key for an efficient lifted analysis is a proper handling of variability-specific constructs of the language (e.g., feature-based runtime tests and [Formula: see text] directives). In this work, we introduce a new symbolic representation of the lifted abstract domain that can efficiently analyze program families with numerical features. This makes sharing between property elements corresponding to different variants explicitly possible. The elements of the new lifted domain are constraint-based decision trees, where decision nodes are labeled with linear constraints defined over numerical features and the leaf nodes belong to an existing single-program analysis domain. To illustrate the potential of this representation, we have implemented an experimental lifted static analyzer, called SPLNum [Formula: see text] Analyzer, for inferring invariants of C programs. An empirical evaluation on BusyBox and on benchmarks from SV-COMP yields promising preliminary results indicating that our decision trees-based approach is effective and outperforms the baseline tuple-based approach.","Dimovski, Aleksandar S.; Apel, Sven; Legay, Axel",Fundamental Approaches to Software Engineering,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7978791/,472

In the face of a myriad of existential threats, including environmental, pandemic, technological emergencies and war conflicts, the need for peace and planetary system integration becomes compelling and essential. This chapter uses a planetary systems theory approach whereby humankind and the biosphere form a holistic, integrated, and interdependent entity. Nation-states are meta-systems through which human populations take form, find expression, and interact with the biosphere within a planetary system. Twelve Key Strategic Influencer (KSI) nations will shape the contours of an emerging planetary system of this century. As adaptive and complex systems, each nation confronts a myriad of significant humanitarian, socioeconomic, infrastructural, and governance challenges. Moreover, these system domains consist of 18 components each associated with a fundamental human right that KSI nations must effectively address. The effectiveness with which challenges are met is assessed through composite benchmark metrics that form a basis of international comparisons. KSI nations are on similar trajectories to becoming advanced technological knowledge societies that are converging and evolving into an integrated planetary system by the end of the twenty-first century. This chapter defines the contours of the emerging planetary systems and the requisite leadership.","Caro, Denis H.

Global health focuses on the research and programmatic efforts needed to understand the burden of disease worldwide and the surrounding financial, political, medical, policy, workforce, and infrastructure issues. Important questions exist about the intersection between global health and informatics, as well as the value of systems such as electronic health records, national reporting systems, and mobile health applications. In the past, the use of technology to alleviate suffering and support public health activities took precedence over understanding the environment in which technology has to function or developing the evidence base of what works best. In resource-poor environments, deployments of technological solutions face challenges including lack of stable electrical power, Internet connectivity, and a workforce that can support the systems. This chapter explores these issues through case studies of the implementation of electronic health record systems in two low income countries, supported by international donors and the US President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief.

The strong finding is that in Sinic East multilateral treaty participation has registered an upward leap. Japan’s multilateral treaty participation came very early after the defeat in 1945. Japan’s development was orchestrated by joining in the United Nations in 1956 and the multilateral treaties such as the International Monetary Fund, the International Bank of Economic Recovery and Development, and the OECD in the early and mid-1960s, leading The Economist magazine to publish a “Consider Japan” editorial in 1962. In early and mid-1970s Japan’s elevation to the developed North club position was established with the its becoming a founder member of Group of Seven. Policy domain-wise, Japan’s good footing in the International Labor Organization and General Agreements on Tariffs and Trade cannot be underestimated. While the four Asian tigers (South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, and Hong Kong) dramatically and nimbly solidified their economic position in the 1970s through 1990s, China evolved through waves of upward leaps: first, by opening to Japan and the United States through the 1970s, second through lifting economic sanctions by Japan followed by the rest of the West in the early 1990s after the massacre of the Tiananmen square protesters, and finally with the joining and acquiring privileged status in the World Trade Organization in the early 2000s. All of these advances have been dramatic. After Vietnam’s very long years of war-footings, internal and external, it has benefited from the long East Asian peace (Tønnesson 2019), from the peace agreement between the United States and Vietnam in 1973, the peace agreement between China and Vietnam in 1984 to the reform policy starting in 1986 and the joining in the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) in 1991 through the US-led economic sanctions against China in 2017 onward. Its development has also been noteworthy. Multilateral treaties have been very transformative in themselves. Sinic East has been very adaptive to the changing internal preferences and global preferences, orchestrating has worked well. Even North Korea has been moving dexterously: Even after many years of absence in multilateral treaties, North Korea was early in joining multilateral treaties dealing with intellectual property and the environment and once joining the United Nations in 1992 it has joined more multilateral treaties per year than the United States since 1945.","Inoguchi, Takashi; Le, Lien Thi Quynh",Digitized Statecraft in Multilateral Treaty Participation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7980173/,472

In the COVID-19 pandemic in particular, personnel and intensive care beds with ventilators have turned out to be the immediate specific bottlenecks.

Social pressures to inhibit certain thoughts generate a sense of dissonance and inhibit the flourishing of epistemic virtue – especially open-mindedness and concern for truth. These pressures undermine the motivation to pursue intellectual honesty and its effectiveness when pursued. The chapter expounds the classical arguments for free enquiry and discussion produced by J. S. Mill and defends them against some contemporary criticisms – for example, that free enquiry is not always truth-conducive. The strongest of Mill’s arguments is that someone who seeks to suppress enquiry assumes his own infallibility. The ‘democratic’ interpretation of this argument is emphasised. Accepting that truth does not always immediately prevail in the ‘marketplace of ideas’, the chapter sympathetically expounds Mill’s argument that truth-sensitive methods of enquiry flourish best in a culture of free thought and discussion.","Benn, Piers",Intellectual Freedom and the Culture Wars,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7981123/,472

There exists a fully abstract game model of [Formula: see text] , which in principle can be used to prove equivalence and safety of [Formula: see text] programs. Unfortunately, the problems are undecidable for the whole language, and only very rudimentary decidable sub-languages are known. We propose leafy automata as a dedicated automata-theoretic formalism for representing the game semantics of [Formula: see text] . The automata use an infinite alphabet with a tree structure. We show that the game semantics of any [Formula: see text] term can be represented by traces of a leafy automaton. Conversely, the traces of any leafy automaton can be represented by a [Formula: see text] term. Because of the close match with [Formula: see text] , we view leafy automata as a promising starting point for finding decidable subclasses of the language and, more generally, to provide a new perspective on models of higher-order concurrent computation. Moreover, we identify a fragment of [Formula: see text] that is amenable to verification by translation into a particular class of leafy automata. Using a locality property of the latter class, where communication between levels is restricted and every other level is bounded, we show that their emptiness problem is decidable by reduction to Petri net reachability.","Dixon, Alex; Lazić, Ranko; Murawski, Andrzej S.; Walukiewicz, Igor",Foundations of Software Science and Computation Structures,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7984116/,472
50302,Reading and Managing Service Businesses: An Integrated Case Study Approach,2020-11-27,"The COVID-19 pandemic has affected several economic sectors in India, dragging many to the brink of survival. In particular, the already fragile horticulture industry is now facing a double burden of a weak value chain management system as well as perishability of produce (fresh fruits and vegetables), this pandemic season. Also, the strict enforcement of lockdown has altered both demand and supply factors, which in turn have shocked various linkages in the value chain of fresh fruits and vegetables. So, this paper dissects the value chain management of grapes and its processed products, namely juice, wine, and raisins in Maharashtra, the largest producer of grapes in India. For this, a value chain analysis (VCA) is carried out by computing the degree of value addition to uncover the rupture points caused by the pandemic as well as advocate policy measures to build a resilient system. The value chain analysis shows that post-COVID-19, the degree of value addition, has shot up for the intermediary agents, i.e., pre-harvest contractors, at the expense of the farmers. Using the insights from the VCA results plus the demand and supply shocks, various policy measures are elucidated to strengthen the grape value chain.","Ravi Kumar, K.

Interoperability of EHR systems at a national level is inadequate even in developed countries. Integration of EHR systems should include all national healthcare entities across all layers of healthcare, resulting in a centralized, National e-Health System (NeHS). Diabetes related information has to be part of the NeHS. The NeHS was introduced in the Republic of North Macedonia since 01-July-2013. Implementation of the NeHS has been praised internationally as a key platform for improving the performance of the national healthcare system. Introduction of NeHS provided the first opportunity for evaluation of prevalence of diagnosed diabetes cases, unlike the previous data based on extrapolations from other countries in the region. The NeHS could be used for monitoring of risk factors and development of diabetes complications. The NeHS has served as a human resources management tool by identifying the need of additional human resources in diabetes care. The NeHS was essential in discovering prescribers who were violating the guidelines, and played a crucial role in the rationalization of diabetes costs.

Therefore, given the situation where the target domain contains only a small number of available unlabeled data sets and multi-source domains contain a large number of labeled data sets, a new Multi-source Fast Transfer Learning algorithm based on support vector machine(MultiFTLSVM) is proposed in this paper. Given the idea of multi-source transfer learning, more source domain knowledge is taken to train the target domain learning task to improve classification effect. At the same time, the representative data set of the source domain is taken to speed up the algorithm training process to improve the efficiency of the algorithm.

51893,Biomedical Engineering Education and the Special COVID-19 Issue,2020-09-29,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a serious and even lethal respiratory illness. The mortality of critically ill patients with COVID-19, especially short term mortality, is considerable. It is crucial and urgent to develop risk models that can predict the mortality risks of patients with COVID-19 at an early stage, which is helpful to guide clinicians in making appropriate decisions and optimizing the allocation of hospital resoureces. METHODS: In this retrospective observational study, we enrolled 949 adult patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to Tongji Hospital in Wuhan between January 28 and February 12, 2020. Demographic, clinical and laboratory data were collected and analyzed. A multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was performed to calculate hazard ratios and 95% confidence interval for assessing the risk factors for 30-day mortality. RESULTS: The 30-day mortality was 11.8% (112 of 949 patients). Forty-nine point nine percent (474) patients had one or more comorbidities, with hypertension being the most common (359 [37.8%] patients), followed by diabetes (169 [17.8%] patients) and coronary heart disease (89 [9.4%] patients). Age above 50 years, respiratory rate above 30 beats per minute, white blood cell count of more than10 × 10(9)/L, neutrophil count of more than 7 × 10(9)/L, lymphocyte count of less than 0.8 × 10(9)/L, platelet count of less than 100 × 10(9)/L, lactate dehydrogenase of more than 400 U/L and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein of more than 50 mg/L were independent risk factors associated with 30-day mortality in patients with COVID-19. A predictive CAPRL score was proposed integrating independent risk factors. The 30-day mortality were 0% (0 of 156), 1.8% (8 of 434), 12.9% (26 of 201), 43.0% (55 of 128), and 76.7% (23 of 30) for patients with 0, 1, 2, 3, ≥4 points, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We designed an easy-to-use clinically predictive tool for assessing 30-day mortality risk of COVID-19. It can accurately stratify hospitalized patients with COVID-19 into relevant risk categories and could provide guidance to make further clinical decisions.","Chen, Hui-Long; Yan, Wei-Ming; Chen, Guang; Zhang, Xiao-Yun; Zeng, Zhi-Lin; Wang, Xiao-Jing; Qi, Wei-Peng; Wang, Min; Li, Wei-Na; Ma, Ke; Xu, Dong; Ni, Ming; Huang, Jia-Quan; Zhu, Lin; Zhang, Shen; Chen, Liang; Wang, Hong-Wu; Ding, Chen; Zhang, Xiao-Ping; Chen, Jia; Yu, Hai-Jing; Ding, Hong-Fang; Wu, Liang; Xing, Ming-You; Song, Jian-Xin; Chen, Tao; Luo, Xiao-Ping; Guo, Wei; Han, Mei-Fang; Wu, Di; Ning, Qin",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8057317/,472

Here, we attempt to clarify the relationship between different types of abuse and depression while focusing on childhood abuse. This article, unlike prior research, provides an overview that addresses physical, psychological, and sexual abuse and their psychological impact on the victims. Results show that abuse is a vulnerability factor for a variety of mental and physical health problems and that psychological abuse is strongly associated with depression. More research is needed to understand (a) the role of abuse in the development and maintenance of depression and, in particular, longitudinal studies that also account for the large number of risk and protective factors that influence this relationship and (b) how different types of abuse can influence response to treatment among survivors with depression, in order to provide effective trauma-focused approaches to manage depressive symptoms.","Radell, Milen L.; Abo Hamza, Eid G.; Daghustani, Wid H.; Perveen, Asma; Moustafa, Ahmed A.",Depress Res Treat,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8060108/,472

A history of DM2, advanced age and other comorbidities are considered predictors of higher morbidity and mortality, it is also known that blood glucose and DM levels are independent predictors of morbidity and mortality in patients with SARS. It should be remembered that patients with DM2 suffer from a chronic low grade inflammation that could facilitate the cytokine storm which in turn would be the cause of severe cases of COVID 19 pneumonia and the eventual death of many patients. Glucocorticoids have a stimulating and inhibitory effect on the immune response according to the moment in which it is administered and its circulating levels insulin therapy has been shown to decrease inflammation. For the control of glycemia the objectives must be individualized. Glycemic and individualized targets for non critical hospitalized patients have been established by different scientific societies such as ADA and AACE and Endocrine Society. In Honduras the protocol for the clinical management of adult patients with COVID 19 was developed to establish and standardize timely treatment in patients with suspected or confirmed COVID 19 which consists of the MAIZ scheme and the MAIZ scheme AAA. A retrospective longitudinal descriptive study was carried out with a review of the data obtained from 32 patients diagnosed with DM2 and COVID19 during the months of June through September 2020 at the CAMI Comprehensive Medical Care Clinic located in the city of Tegucigalpa Honduras collecting epidemiological and clinical data. The results of the research show that of the 32 patients with DM2 and COVID 19, 59% (19) belong to the male gender and 41% (13) to the female gender, with an average age of 60 years. In the COVID19 severity classification the evaluated patients presented in the following condition mild 25% (8), moderate 69% (22) and severe 6% (2). The diagnostic method used was detection of anti SARS CoV2 antibodies 56% (17) and TR-PCR 43% (14). 75% (24) received steroids, 8.69% (2) of the patients who used steroids in their management had hyperglycemia and required management with regular insulin. 100% (32) of the patients who were treated recovered without registering any death. Conclusions: are that the pathophysiological factors of DM2 in relation to the immune system of patients can be a determining factor to present a degree of severity greater than that presented by the general population that falls ill with COVID19.

Unfortunately, this unusual feature can often lead to missed or delayed diagnosis with potential life-threatening outcomes. Clinical Case: The patient is a 53-year-old Caucasian male with PMH of type 2 diabetes mellitus treating with Metformin and Empagliflozin. He presented to the emergency room with shortness of breath, flu-like symptoms, and decreased oral intake for a couple of days. Vital signs at presentation were: Temperature 98.2 °F, pulse rate 108 beats/min, respiratory rate 28 breaths/min, and blood pressure 134/72 mmHg. He was alert but ill-looking, moderately dehydrated with dry mucus membranes. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable at the time of admission. In the initial blood work, sugar was found to be mildly elevated (163mg/dl), and hemoconcentration besides mild pre-renal acute kidney injury was detected. He was also found infected by the COVID-19 virus without hypoxemia or signs of pneumonia. Arterial blood gases showed metabolic acidosis with an elevated anion gap (PH 7.21, CO(2) 39.93mmHg, HCO(3)(−) 10mEq/L, anion gap 21mEq/L). Urine analysis was positive for ketones and glucose. After ruling out other causes of metabolic acidosis by screening for alcohols, salicylates, acetaminophen, lactic acid, and urine toxicology; the diagnosis of EDKA was made. He was treated with a 3L bolus of IV normal saline and an insulin drip with dextrose solution started as per the protocol based on his glucose levels and promptly admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Serial blood tests showed gradual resolution of ketoacidosis and anion gap normalized after 36 hours when insulin drip was stopped and replaced by subcutaneous insulin therapy. Conclusion: SGLT2 inhibitors increase the urinary excretion rate of glucose and subsequent fall in plasma glucose level. Thus, In the absence of exogenous insulin use, increase glucagon release resulting in upregulation of lipolysis and activation of the ketogenesis. Factors such as low oral intake, concurrent infection, and alcohol use can also exacerbate the process. Timely diagnosis of EDKA can be a challenge for physicians unfamiliar with this class of medications, additionally, ketone studies and blood gas analyses are not part of the routine workup for diabetic patients in the emergency department. We recommend all first-line care providers to consider ketosis in ill patients with diabetes and metabolic acidosis, despite the normal or near-normal serum glucose levels. EDKA is mainly a diagnosis of exclusion, but treatment is not different from DKA; correcting dehydration by using intravenous fluids and then, initiating insulin drip along with dextrose-containing solutions, and frequent monitoring of serum anion gap.","TakallooBakhtiari, Asieh; Butina, Julio Piedra; Funderburk, Sheri A Gillis; Brundavanam, Hari V",J Endocr Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8090115/,472
52665,What has the pandemic taught us about our infection control measures?,2021-05-10,"Rhinovirus C (RV-C) infection is associated with severe asthma exacerbations. Since type 2 inflammation is an important disease mechanism in asthma, we hypothesized that RV-C infection, in contrast to RV-A, preferentially stimulates type 2 inflammation, leading to exacerbated eosinophilic inflammation. To test this, we developed a mouse model of RV-C15 airways disease. RV-C15 was generated from the full-length cDNA clone and grown in HeLa-E8 cells expressing human CDHR3. BALB/c mice were inoculated intranasally with 5 x 10(6) ePFU RV-C15, RV-A1B or sham. Mice inoculated with RV-C15 showed lung viral titers of 1 x 10(5) TCID(50) units 24 h after infection, with levels declining thereafter. IFN-α, β, γ and λ2 mRNAs peaked 24-72 hrs post-infection. Immunofluorescence verified colocalization of RV-C15, CDHR3 and acetyl-α-tubulin in mouse ciliated airway epithelial cells. Compared to RV-A1B, mice infected with RV-C15 demonstrated higher bronchoalveolar eosinophils, mRNA expression of IL-5, IL-13, IL-25, Muc5ac and Gob5/Clca, protein production of IL-5, IL-13, IL-25, IL-33 and TSLP, and expansion of type 2 innate lymphoid cells. Analogous results were found in mice treated with house dust mite before infection, including increased airway responsiveness. In contrast to Rora (fl/fl) littermates, RV-C-infected Rora (fl/fl) Il7r (cre) mice deficient in ILC2s failed to show eosinophilic inflammation or mRNA expression of IL-13, Muc5ac and Muc5b. We conclude that, compared to RV-A1B, RV-C15 infection induces ILC2-dependent type 2 airway inflammation, providing insight into the mechanism of RV-C-induced asthma exacerbations.","Rajput, Charu; Han, Mingyuan; Ishikawa, Tomoko; Lei, Jing; Goldsmith, Adam M.; Jazaeri, Seyedehzarifeh; Stroupe, Claudia C.; Bentley, J.

This paper outlines the historical development of European wine policy under the CAP, and presents a more detailed analysis of the economic consequences of the rules and regulations under the appellation system. The introduction of these rules and regulations was probably beneficial initially, both for their didactive effect on wine producers and consumers and as a way of overcoming a significant “lemons” problem in the market. However, those same rules and regulations are much less valuable today, given (1) the potential for alternative sources of information to solve the lemons problem, and (2) evidence that the appellation system per se might not be effectively serving that purpose as well as it once did, while some of the regulations impose significant social costs. Yield restrictions, in particular, are economically inefficient as a way of enhancing and signaling quality (their ostensible purpose) and as a way of restricting total supply to support market prices and thus producer incomes (a significant motivation). The inherent weaknesses of the policy design are compounded by failures of governance. A less heavy-handed approach to policy would allow more scope for the market mechanism to match supply and demand for this signature product from European agriculture.","Alston, Julian M.; Gaeta, Davide",Ital Econ J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8106375/,472

Near overnight, people faced a new and unfamiliar situation, with restrictive measures in place, extensive uncertainty and the closing down of much of society. The present study explores the meaning-making and coping in everyday life of 16 participants interviewed early in the pandemic. Norway, compared to many other settings in the world, is a privileged context. Nonetheless, participants struggled with this breach with their normal lives. The participants spoke of adapting to the new normal, how the concept of time had changed, how they handled socialisation, dealing with restricted freedom, and imagining the future. Actively drawing on communal coping, as well as problem-focused and emotion-focused individual coping strategies, participants’ accounts illustrate the on-going process of making meaning of their new lives under lockdown. In our discussion, we synthesise various coping processes that the participants made use of in their handling of the new situation. Even though the COVID-19 pandemic is a shared stressor, it influences people differently, and our research contributes with valuable insights into this variation. The recognition of different meaning-making and coping strategies is crucial, as it can constructively inform the development of political and social responses to the pandemic that actively encompasses the variation in individual experiences and ramifications.","Sandbakken, Ella Marie; Moss, Sigrun Marie",Hu Arenas,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8106994/,472

It considers four scenarios—varying in both the duration of school closures and the effectiveness of any mitigation strategies being deployed by governments. Using data on 174 countries, the analysis finds that the global level of schooling and learning will fall substantially. School closures could result in a loss of between 0.3 and 1.1 years of schooling adjusted for quality, bringing down the effective years of basic schooling that students achieve during their lifetime from 7.8 years to between 6.7 and 7.5 years. Close to 11 million students from primary up to secondary education could drop out due to the income shock of the pandemic alone. Exclusion and inequality will likely be exacerbated if already marginalized and vulnerable groups, such as girls, ethnic minorities, and persons with disabilities, are more adversely affected by school closures. Students from the current cohort could, on average, face a reduction of $366 to $1,776 in yearly earnings. In present value terms, this amounts to between $6,680 and $32,397 dollars in lost earnings over a typical student's lifetime. Globally, a school shutdown of 5 months could generate learning losses that have a present value of $10 trillion. By this measure, the world could stand to lose as much as 16 percent of the investments that governments make in the basic education of this cohort of students. In the pessimistic and very pessimistic scenarios, cumulative losses could add up to between $16 and $20 trillion in present value terms. Unless drastic remedial action is taken, the world could face a substantial setback in achieving the goal of halving the percentage of learning poor by 2030.","Azevedo, João Pedro; Hasan, Amer; Goldemberg, Diana; Geven, Koen; Iqbal, Syedah Aroob",World Bank Res Obs,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8108634/,472

Candidates were solely scored on portfolio self-assessment alone. We have assessed the impact on Core Surgical Trainee progression into ST3 by comparing the 2020 recruitment year with 2019. METHOD: Total numbers of applicants to ST3 for all 7 surgical sub-specialties that recruit at ST3 level were obtained via Freedom of Information requests from Health Education England (HEE). These were sorted by those who were in CST, had completed CST or had an alternative equivalence certificate. RESULTS: Overall applicant numbers were up in 2020, mainly from an increase in applicants with a Certificate of Readiness to Enter Higher Surgical Training. Overall ST3 positions appointed to were down. CST progression rate was down slightly, with an increase in appointees >10 years since graduation. CONCLUSIONS: The 2020 recruitment year for ST3 HST had a higher number of applicants and lower places available than 2019. The majority of the extra applicants were trainees who have not completed CST in the UK. CST progression rate to HST was down slightly.

53534,Asymmetric dependence of intraday frequency components in the Brazilian stock market,2021-05-26,"FUNDING ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS: Type of funding sources: None. BACKGROUND: Fatigue is a frequent and debilitating symptom of multiple sclerosis (MS), affecting 90% of patients. Symptoms seems multifactorial, but little is known about the contribution of cardiovascular morpho-functional alterations linked to comorbidities, to lifestyle, to MS itself or to drugs (i.e. mitoxantrone). AIM: to investigate the presence of cardiac alterations in MS patients, and to evaluate their impact on fatigue. METHODS: 24 patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RR-MS) underwent an electrocardiogram (ECG), a transthoracic echocardiographic (TTE), a six minutes walking test (6MWT) with Borg scale (BS), and two fatigue self-assessment scales, the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) and the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS). The patients were divided into 2 groups: group 1, without traditional cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF: smoke, hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia; n = 12, 11 females), and group 2, with at least one CVRF (n = 12, 5 females). None of the patients had ever been on mitoxantrone therapy. No new control group was studied due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic restrictions , so the comparison was performed with general healthy population in internationally validated previous studies. RESULTS: No arrhythmias were found. In both MS groups all the TTE left ventricular (LV) systolic function parameters were depressed compared to the healthy population, but only the mean global longitudinal strain (GLS), the mean longitudinal strain rate (LSR) of LV and estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PAPs) were statistically significant depressed compared to the healthy general population (p < 0.005): see table. This reduction was observed in both MS groups, while there were non significant differences among the two groups. TTE LV function depression significantly correlated to variation of parameters of fatigue , especially considering LV GLS in relation to BS values. CONCLUSIONS: Subclinical biventricular systolic dysfunction is present in MS patients, and it seems to be linked to the disease itself without being influenced by CVRF. This dysfunction, detected by speckle tracking echocardiographic techniques, seems to contribute to the symptom of fatigue in patients with MS. It is important to include TTE in the workup and follow-up of MS patients, in order to promptly treat cardiac dysfunction and relieve fatigue.","Michelotto, E; Oliva, MC; Amoruso, MT; Giovannetti, G; Battista, C; Andreani, M; Mazzilli, D; Amico, AP; Tota, A; Megna, M; D""agostino, C; Palmieri, VO; Colonna, P",Eur J Prev Cardiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8136090/,472

Because both bone and vascular smooth muscle cells are composed of type 1 collagen, we hypothesized that the integrity of blood vessels around the infarction area might be more damaged in osteoporotic conditions after a cardioembolic stroke. Methods: we measured frontal skull Hounsfield unit (HU) values on brain CT images from cardioembolic stroke patients. We conducted a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis in a large sample registry to identify the optimal HU threshold for predicting osteopenia and osteoporosis. Hazard ratios were estimated using a Cox regression analysis to identify whether osteoporotic conditions were an independent predictor of PH-type HT in patients with cardioembolic stroke. Results: altogether, 600 consecutive patients (>18 years old) with cardioembolic stroke were enrolled over a 12-year period at our hospital. The infarction volume and hypothetical osteoporosis were independent predictive factors for PH-type HT development in patients with cardioembolic stroke. In the male group, hypothetical osteoporosis was an independent predictor for PH-type HT development after cardioembolic stroke (hazard ratio, 4.12; 95% confidence interval, 1.40–12.10; p = 0.010).

This retrospective and observational study was carried out at the Adult Intensive Care Unit of the University Hospital during a 2-year period. Patients undergoing orotracheal intubation were enrolled. Demographic and clinical data were collected from medical records. A total of 1185 medical records were analyzed, of which 820 were included in the study. The markers associated with intubation for ≥48h were as follows: positive history of diseases (RR=1.42; 95%CI=1.17 to 1.74), especially alcohol addiction (RR=1.60; 95%CI=1.22 to 2.09) or former alcohol addiction (RR=1.50; 95%CI=1.06 to 2.13); clinical hospitalization (RR=1.06; 95%CI=0.98 to 1.16); emergency intubation (RR=3.24; 95%CI=3.01 to 3.95); intubation performed in the emergency department (RR=3.44; 95%CI=3.01 to 3.95) and other hospital facilities (RR=2.92; 95%CI=2.49 to 3.42); and intubation due to lowered level of consciousness (RR=3.40; 95%CI=2.95 to 3.93), acute respiratory failure (RR=3.43; 95%CI=2.98 to 3.54), and airway protection (RR=2.87; 95%CI=2.32 to 3.54). Patients on IMV for ≥48h had an RR of 2.07 (95%CI=1.79 to 2.40) for death. Patients with history of diseases, especially past or current history of alcoholism with clinical hospitalization, who underwent emergency intubation in the emergency department or in other hospital facilities due to lowered level of consciousness, acute respiratory failure, or protect airways, are most likely to require IMV for ≥48h. Also, patients on IMV for ≥48h had an high RR for death.","Creace, Tainã de Godoy; Marson, Fernando Augusto Lima; Cannonieri-Nonose, Gianna Carla",SN Compr Clin Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8208058/,472

It is therefore crucial to meet the demand of cyclists when adapting road infrastructure. Previous studies researching cyclists’ route choice behavior deliver valuable insights but are constrained by laboratory conditions, limitations in the number of observations, or the observation period or relay on specific use cases. METHODS: The present study analyzes a dataset of over 450,000 observations of cyclists’ routing settings for the navigation of individual trips in Berlin, Germany. It therefore analyzes query data recorded in the bike-routing engine BBBike and clusters the many different user settings with regard to preferred route characteristics. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Results condense the large number of routing settings into characteristic preference clusters. Compared with earlier findings, the big data approach highlights the significance of short routes, side streets and the importance of high-quality surfaces for routing choices, while cycling on dedicated facilities seems a little less important. Consequentially, providing separated cycle facilities along main roads – often the main focal point of cycle plans – should be put into the context of an integrated strategy which fulfills distinct preferences to achieve greater success. It is therefore particularly important to provide a cycle network in calm residential streets as well as catering for short, direct cycle routes.","Hardinghaus, Michael; Nieland, Simon",Eur,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8314267/,472
56824,A novel imbalanced data classification approach for suicidal ideation detection on social media,2021-08-17,"Portugal and Spain share five large river basins. The human activities carried out in the rivers or in the river basin area generate mutual interferences and impacts on the quality and quantity of water and on the ecologic conditions of the rivers and surrounding ecosystems. Furthermore, the effects of climate change on river ecosystems in the Mediterranean region—namely drought, water scarcity, desertification, flooding, heat waves, soil salinization, invasive species—are leading to larger water stress periods and an overall reduction of ecosystem services. In this context, the main ethic challenges regarding joint management of shared river basins in the Iberian Peninsula are: territorial equity, geomorphologic equity, demographic equity, interspecies equity, development equity, intergenerational equity and cultural equity. To address these challenges, a set of principles of international environmental law are briefly analysed. These principles govern the relations between States, regulate the access to the rivers, preserve the ecologic equilibrium of the rivers, and influence risk management. The principles also limit State discretionarily towards possible river uses and shape international agreements to be adopted in the future.","Aragão, Alexandra",Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8355574/,472

It is not only related to the safety of tourists' lives and property, but also related to social stability and sustainable development of the tourism industry. However, the security early warning of many scenic spots focuses on the response measures and remedial plans after the occurrence of security incidents, and the staff of many scenic spots have limited security awareness and information analysis ability, which is prone to lag in information release, and do not pay attention to the information of potential security problems. Therefore, this paper studies the optimization algorithm of the tourism security early warning information system based on the LSTM model and uses the recurrent neural network and LSTM to improve the processing and prediction ability of time-series data. The experimental results show that the number of three hidden layers in the tourism security early warning information system based on the LSTM model can reduce the training time of the model and improve the performance. Compared with the tourism safety early warning information system based on the BP neural network, it has better accuracy and stability, has better processing and prediction ability for time series data, and can monitor and analyze data scientifically in real-time and dynamically analyze data.","Feng, Lei; Hao, Yukai",Comput Intell Neurosci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8443355/,472

58882,Does the adoption of emerging technologies improve technical efficiency? Evidence from Korean manufacturing SMEs,2021-10-07,"Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable clonal B-cell malignancy that usually presents with neoplastic monoclonal plasma cells in either bone or soft tissues. Central nervous system involvement of the myeloma (CNS-MM), such as dural myeloma or intraparenchymal infiltration, or diffuse leptomeningeal involvement, is uncommon. Dural involvement of myeloma without parenchymal or leptomeningeal disease is even rarer, with only seven cases reported previously. We present a case of epidural myeloma in a 50-year-old man with known kappa light chain MM, presenting with multiple episodes of subdural hemorrhage and progressive neurological deficits. He initially presented with severe back pain, hypercalcemia, and acute kidney injury (AKI). Further evaluation showed lytic bone lesions and elevated kappa light chains, and bone marrow biopsy showed 32% of clonal plasma cells. He was initially treated with bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone combination, followed by pomalidomide and daratumumab. Eventually, he developed two episodes of subdural hemorrhage and left-sided seventh cranial nerve palsy, which was treated conservatively and monitored by computed tomography (CT) of the head. However, he gradually developed multiple cranial nerve palsies, weakness, and urinary incontinence. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed elevated protein without any aberrant immunophenotype. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed diffuse smooth dural enhancement with extensive calvarial and skull base marrow replacement; MRI of the spine showed diffuse epidural enhancement in thoracic and lumbar regions, findings consistent with epidural myeloma. The patient received three doses of cranial irradiation but, unfortunately, could not tolerate further treatment and opted for hospice care. Intracranial hemorrhage is common in MM patients, and it is important to consider CNS involvement in patients presenting with recurrent subdural hemorrhage and to perform imaging (preferably MRI) earlier in the disease course. Due to its rarity, the treatment of CNS-MM is very heterogeneous. Thus, case reporting is important to accumulate data on this rare presentation.","Sivakolundu, Keerthana P; Vijaya Prakash, Aviraag; Savage, Natasha M; Kota, Vamsi K; Zarkua, Kristina",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8496494/,472

71315,"COVID-19 Vaccine: Development, Testing, and Distribution.",2021,"BACKGROUND Rates of methamphetamine use and methamphetamine-related deaths have increased steadily in the United States in recent years. Methamphetamine is increasingly present in opioid-related deaths. An initial study of de-identified urine specimens (n = 102) collected at a drug treatment program between 2017 and 2018 indicated that 61% of specimens contained methamphetamine; of the specimens containing methamphetamine, people were, on average, five years younger than those who tested negative for methamphetamine; and non-fentanyl opioids were more than three times as common in methamphetamine positive specimens. The National Drug Early Warning System (NDEWS) Coordinating Center initiated a HotSpot Study to assess whether there was an emerging dynamic in the area, or if enhanced data collection could give insights into the co-use of methamphetamine and opioids. METHODS A qualitative study, grounded in principles of rapid ethnographic assessment and a social science/anthropological framework was conducted and used methodological complementarity to contextualize results from the initial urinalysis study. Targeted sampling was conducted at two treatment sites. Program staff and patients were recruited to participate in focus groups and semi-structured interviews to assess structural, community, and individual-level factors impacting methamphetamine and opioid co-use. RESULTS Within our broader framework of structural, community, and individual-level factors intersecting co-use, our data yielded three sub-themes: 1) the circulation of stigma regarding methamphetamine use was consistently described by both patients and staff and this intersected structural changes in treatment policy and suggested compounded stigma; 2) community-level factors and temporality were important for understanding patterns of methamphetamine use and for further interpreting the initial urinalysis; 3) patient rationales regarding the co-use of methamphetamine and opioids included strategies to mitigate the harms of heroin, as well as to detox or titrate the effects of heroin. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS Using an ethnographically-oriented and social science/anthropological approach and methodological complementarity to contextualize the prior urinalysis study demonstrates how behavioral variables cannot be abstracted from larger socio-structural and community contexts which impact people's decision-making process regarding co-use of methamphetamine and opioids. Further, by grounding our analysis in the meaning-centered and experiential narratives of people who use drugs, our research demonstrates the importance of considering the expertise of people who co-use opioids and methamphetamine as central for informing future sustainable program planning to address co-use that also accounts for the interrelationship between structural, community, and individual-level factors.","Lopez, Andrea M; Dhatt, Zena; Howe, Mary; Al-Nassir, Marwa; Billing, Amy; Artigiani, Eleanor; Wish, Eric D",The International journal on drug policy,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugpo.2020.103098; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33476863/,472

76414,Preparing nurse leaders for 2020.,2008,"AbstractA COVID-19 vaccine with capability to induce early protection is needed to efficiently eliminate viral spread. Here, we demonstrate the development of a nanoparticle vaccine candidate, REVC-128, in which multiple trimeric spike ectodomain with glycine (G) at position 614 were multimerized onto a nanoparticle. In-vitro characterization of this vaccine confirms its structural and antigenic integrity. In-vivo immunogenicity evaluation in mice indicates that a single dose of this vaccine induces potent serum neutralizing antibody titer at two weeks post immunization, which is significantly higher than titer induced by trimeric spike protein without nanoparticle presentation. The comparison of serum binding to spike subunits between animals immunized by spike with and without nanoparticle presentation indicates that nanoparticle prefers the display of spike RBD (Receptor-Binding Domain) over S2 subunit, likely resulting in a more neutralizing but less cross-reactive antibody response. Moreover, a Syrian golden hamster in-vivo model for SARS-CoV-2 virus challenge was implemented at two weeks post a single dose of REVC-128 immunization. The results showed that vaccination protects hamsters against SARS-CoV-2 virus challenge with evidence of steady body weight, suppressed viral loads and alleviation of tissue damage for protected animals, compared with ∼10% weight loss, high viral loads and tissue damage in unprotected animals. Furthermore, the data showed that vaccine REVC-128 is thermostable at up to 37°C for at least 4 weeks. These findings, along with history of safety for protein vaccines, suggest that the REVC-128 is a safe, stable and efficacious single-shot vaccine candidate to induce the earliest protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Gu, Maggie; Torres, Jonathan L; Li, Yijia; Ry, Alex Van; Greenhouse, Jack; Wallace, Shannon; Chiang, Chi-I; Pessaint, Laurent; Jackson, Abigail M; Porto, Maciel; Kar, Swagata; Li, Yuxing; Ward, Andrew B; Wang, Yimeng",Emerging microbes & infections,https://doi.org/10.1080/22221751.2021.1994354; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34651563/,472

We aimed to: 1) summarize MRI methods of published studies investigating T2 and T1ρ relaxation time in participants at risk for but without radiographic knee OA; and 2) compare T2 and T1ρ relaxation between participants at-risk for knee OA and healthy controls. METHODS We conducted a systematic review of studies reporting T2 and T1ρ relaxation data that included both participants at risk for knee OA and healthy controls. Participant characteristics, MRI methodology, and T1ρ and T2 relaxation data were extracted. Standardized mean differences (SMDs) were calculated within each study. Pooled effect sizes were then calculated for six commonly segmented knee compartments. RESULTS 55 articles met eligibility criteria. There was considerable variability between scanners, coils, software, scanning protocols, pulse sequences, and post-processing. Moderate risk of bias due to lack of blinding was common. Pooled effect sizes indicated participants at risk for knee OA had lengthened T2 relaxation time in all compartments (SMDs from 0.33 to 0.74; p < 0.01) and lengthened T1ρ relaxation time in the femoral compartments (SMD from 0.35 to 0.40; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS T2 and T1ρ relaxation distinguish participants at risk for knee OA from healthy controls. Greater standardization of MRI methods is both warranted and required for progress towards biomarker validation.","Atkinson, Hayden F; Birmingham, Trevor B; Moyer, Rebecca F; Yacoub, Daniel; Kanko, Lauren E; Bryant, Dianne M; Thiessen, Jonathan D; Thompson, R Terry",BMC musculoskeletal disorders,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12891-019-2547-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31039785/,472

This scoping review seeks to synthesize the landscape of literature on the topic of data collection and utilization for trainees' WBAs in emergency medicine (EM). Methods The authors conducted a scoping review in the style of Arksey and O'Malley, seeking to synthesize and map literature on collecting, aggregating, and reporting WBA data. The authors extracted, mapped, and synthesized literature that describes, supports, and substantiates effective data collection and utilization in the context of the CBME movement within EM. Results Our literature search retrieved 189 potentially relevant references (after removing duplicates) that were screened to 29 abstracts and papers relevant to collecting, aggregating, and reporting WBAs. Our analysis shows that there is an increasing temporal trend toward contributions in these topics, with the majority of the papers (16/29) being published in the past 3 years alone. Conclusion There is increasing interest in the areas around data collection and utilization in the age of CBME.

Measurement parameters during intraoperative ICG fluorescence angiography (ICG-FA) are unclear. We aimed to identify objective ICG-FA parameters associated with AL. STUDY DESIGN Patients > 18 years with an indication for ILE were enrolled. ICG-FA was performed at the abdominal and thoracic stage, and data, such as time of fluorescence appearance, speed of ICG perfusion, quality of GC perfusion (good, poor, ischemic), blood pressure, baseline patient characteristics, GC dimensions, and other intraoperative parameters were collected. On postoperative day 4 to 6, Gastrografin swallow radiography was performed. AL development was classified based on the Clavien-Dindo and SISG severity classifications. Univariate analysis with a 95% confidence level (p < 0.05) was performed. Factors with p < 0.05 were included in the multivariate analysis. RESULTS 100 patients were enrolled. During ICG-FA, evaluation of subjective perfusion was a very specific test (94.1%) with good negative predictive value (NPV 71.9%, p 0.034), but not powerful enough to detect patients at risk of leak (sensibility 21.8%, PPV 63.6%). The GC perfusion speed (cm/s) after gastric vascular isolation and before tubulization showed a significant association with AL (p < 0.003). Median arterial blood pressure in the thoracic stage (p < 0.001) or use of inotropic (p < 0.033) was associated with AL development. CONCLUSION GC perfusion speed at ICG-FA is an objective parameter that could predict AL risk. Other results emphasize the importance of the microcirculation in the development of AL.","Talavera-Urquijo, Eider; Parise, Paolo; Palucci, Marco; Olivari, Greta; Turi, Stefano; Cossu, Andrea; Barbieri, Lavinia; Elmore, Ugo; Rosati, Riccardo",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-020-07924-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32856151/,472
83346,Transitioning your course to online: High-yield modifications for success.,2021-09-01,"OBJECT The authors undertook this study to investigate whether the physiological mechanism of cerebral blood flow (CBF) regulation by alteration of the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO₂) can be used to increase CBF after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). METHODS In 6 mechanically ventilated patients with poor-grade aSAH, the PaCO₂ was first decreased to 30 mm Hg by modification of the respiratory rate, then gradually increased to 40, 50 and 60 mm Hg for 15 minutes each setting. Thereafter, the respirator settings were returned to baseline parameters. Intracerebral CBF measurement and brain tissue oxygen saturation (StiO₂), measured by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), were the primary and secondary end points. Intracranial pressure (ICP) was controlled by external ventricular drainage. RESULTS A total of 60 interventions were performed in 6 patients. CBF decreased to 77% of baseline at a PaCO₂ of 30 mm Hg and increased to 98%, 124%, and 143% at PaCO₂ values of 40, 50, and 60 mm Hg, respectively. Simultaneously, StiO₂ decreased to 94%, then increased to 99%, 105%, and 111% of baseline. A slightly elevated delivery rate of cerebrospinal fluid was noticed under continuous drainage. ICP remained constant. After returning to baseline respirator settings, both CBF and StiO₂ remained elevated and only gradually returned to pre-hypercapnia values without a rebound effect. None of the patients developed secondary cerebral infarction. CONCLUSIONS Gradual hypercapnia was well tolerated by poor-grade SAH patients. Both CBF and StiO₂ reacted with a sustained elevation upon hypercapnia; this elevation outlasted the period of hypercapnia and only slowly returned to normal without a rebound effect. Elevations of ICP were well compensated by continuous CSF drainage. Hypercapnia may yield a therapeutic potential in this state of critical brain perfusion.

This protein is also a prominent component of the so-called neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), whose formation is a part of the innate immunity response to invading pathogens, but also contributes to a variety of pathologies ranging from autoimmune disorders and inflammation to cancer to thrombotic complications in COVID-19. Retention of neutrophil elastase within NETs is provided by ejected DNA chains, although this protein is also capable of interacting with a range of other endogenous polyanions, such as heparin and heparan sulfate. In this work, we evaluate the feasibility of using native mass spectrometry (MS) as a means of studying interactions of neutrophil elastase with heparin oligomers ranging from structurally homogeneous synthetic pentasaccharide fondaparinux to relatively long (up to twenty saccharide units) and structurally heterogeneous chains produced by partial depolymerization of heparin. The presence of heterogeneous glycan chains on neutrophil elastase and the structural heterogeneity of heparin oligomers render the use of standard MS to study their complexes impractical. However, supplementing MS with limited charge reduction in the gas phase allows meaningful data to be extracted from MS measurements. In contrast to earlier molecular modeling studies where a single heparin-binding site was identified, our work reveals the existence of multiple binding sites, with a single protein molecule being able to accommodate up to three decasaccharides. The measurements also reveal the ability of even relatively short heparin oligomers to bridge two protein molecules, suggesting that characterization of these complexes using native MS can shed light on the structural properties of NETs. Lastly, the use of MS allows the binding preferences of heparin oligomers to neutrophil elastase to be studied with respect to specific structural properties of heparin, such as the level of sulfation (i.e., charge density). All experimental measurements are carried out in parallel with molecular dynamics simulations of the protein/heparin oligomer systems, which are in remarkable agreement with the experimental data and highlight the role of electrostatic interactions as dominant forces governing the formation of these complexes.","Niu, Chendi; Du, Yi; Kaltashov, Igor A",International journal of mass spectrometry,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijms.2021.116550; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33692650/,472

Allopurinol reduces serum uric acid and oxidative stress and improves endothelial function and may therefore reduce CBP and CIMT progression. This study sought to ascertain whether allopurinol reduces CBP, arterial stiffness and CIMT progression in patients with ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA). METHODS We performed a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, examining the effect of 1-year treatment with allopurinol (300 mg daily), on change in CBP, arterial stiffness and CIMT progression at 1 year and change in endothelial function and circulating inflammatory markers at 6 months. Patients aged over 18 years with recent ischaemic stroke or TIA were eligible. RESULTS Eighty participants were recruited, mean age 67.8 years (SD 9.4). Systolic CBP [-6.6 mm Hg (95% CI -13.0 to -0.3), p=0.042] and augmentation index [-4.4% (95% CI -7.9 to -1.0), p=0.013] were each lower following allopurinol treatment compared with placebo at 12 months. Progression in mean common CIMT at 1 year was less in allopurinol-treated patients compared with placebo [between-group difference [-0.097 mm (95% CI -0.175 to -0.019), p=0.015]. No difference was observed for measures of endothelial function. CONCLUSIONS Allopurinol lowered CBP and reduced CIMT progression at 1 year compared with placebo in patients with recent ischaemic stroke and TIA. This extends the evidence of sustained beneficial effects of allopurinol to these prognostically significant outcomes and to the stroke population, highlighting the potential for reduction in cardiovascular events with this treatment strategy.

88357,Wildfire and prescribed burning impacts on air quality in the United States.,2020-06-01,"The novel SARS coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 pandemic may be particularly deleterious to patients with underlying cardiovascular disease (CVD). The mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 infection is the requisite binding of the virus to the membrane-bound form of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and internalization of the complex by the host cell. Recognition that ACE2 is the co-receptor for the coronavirus has prompted new therapeutic approaches to block the enzyme or reduce its expression to prevent the cellular entry and SARS-CoV-2 infection in tissues that express ACE2 including lung, heart, kidney, brain, and gut. ACE2, however, is a key enzymatic component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS); ACE2 degrades Ang II, a peptide with multiple actions that promote CVD, and generates Ang-(1-7) which antagonizes the effects of Ang II. Moreover, experimental evidence suggests that RAAS blockade by ACE inhibitors, AT1 receptor antagonists and mineralocorticoid antagonists, as well as statins enhance ACE2 that, in part, contribute to the benefit of these regimens. In lieu of the fact that many older patients with hypertension or other CVDs are routinely treated with RAAS blockers and statins, new clinical concerns have developed regarding whether these patients are at greater risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection, whether RAAS and statin therapy should be discontinued, and the potential consequences of RAAS blockade to COVID-19-related pathologies such as acute and chronic respiratory disease. The current perspective critically examines the evidence for ACE2 regulation by RAAS blockade and statins, the cardiovascular benefits of ACE2, and whether ACE2 blockade is a viable approach to attenuate COVID-19.","South, Andrew Michael; Diz, Debra; Chappell, Mark C",American journal of physiology.

We retrospectively analyzed the data of 12 patients diagnosed with intussusception, following gastrectomy, from 2008 to 2017, including clinical manifestations, incidence, post-LG time-interval before diagnosis, and treatment. Totally, 12/2300 gastrectomy patients (0.52%) developed intussusception. All 12 had undergone laparoscopic distal gastrectomy for gastric cancer (12/1250, 0.96%) and presented with intussusception through a side-to-side jejunojejunal anastomosis. The mean latency period was 423.8 (range: 86 to 1500) days. Four patients underwent emergent laparoscopic reduction of the efferent loop without bowel resection, along with fixation of the reduced jejunum to the afferent loop and the small bowel mesentery, to prevent a recurrence. One patient required open surgery with manual reduction and segmental resection of the gangrenous small bowel portion. All operated patients recovered without any complications. Intussusception resolved spontaneously in the remaining 7/12 patients. We found that a laparoscopic approach can be used for preventing or managing post-LG intussusception. We found that recurrence can be prevented or treated by anchoring and fixing the (reduced) efferent loop to the afferent loop and the small bowel mesentery.","Lee, Si-Hak; Chung, Jae Hun; Choi, Cheol Woong; Kim, Su Jin; Kim, Dae-Hwan; Choi, Chang In; Hwang, Sun-Hwi","Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy & percutaneous techniques",https://doi.org/10.1097/sle.0000000000000773; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32150119/,472

We studied the effect of the depth of NMB during laparoscopic gastrectomy on postoperative pain. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of depth of NMB during laparoscopic gastrectomy on postoperative pain by allocating patients randomly to either deep or moderate NMB with a standard-pressure pneumoperitoneum. DESIGN A randomised, controlled, double-blind study. SETTING A university-affiliated hospital. PARTICIPANTS One hundred patients. INTERVENTIONS Patients were allocated randomly to receive either deep (posttetanic count 1 to 2) or moderate (train-of-four count 1 to 2) levels of NMB. Following surgery, the patients were asked to rate their pain every 10 min using a visual analogue scale (VAS) (0 = no pain, 10 = most severe pain) in the postanaesthesia care unit (PACU). Patients received intravenous oxycodone, 2 mg every 10 min, until the pain intensity (VAS) had decreased to less than 3 at rest and less than 5 on wound compression, at which point the minimum effective analgesia dose (MEAD) of oxycodone was determined. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary endpoint was the MEAD of oxycodone. Secondary endpoints included area under the curve of VAS for wound pain, VAS scores for wound and shoulder pain at 6 and 24 h after the end of surgery, rescue analgesics, a five-point surgical rating scale, Rhodes index of nausea vomiting retching at 6 and 24 h after the end of surgery and duration of pneumoperitoneum. RESULTS The median value for the MEAD of oxycodone was 8 mg in both groups. Area under the curves of VAS over time were similar in both groups. Variables associated with postoperative pain including mean VAS at PACU and frequency of rescue analgesics in the ward did not differ significantly between the two groups. The duration of pneumoperitoneum was a significant variable in determining the MEAD of oxycodone (linear regression, R = 0.07, P = 0.008). The number of patients who reached the acceptable surgical score was not significantly different between the two groups. However, the moderate NMB group did have a significantly higher proportion of cases that required additional muscle relaxants (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION Deep, compared with moderate, NMB did not significantly reduce the MEAD of oxycodone administered in the PACU. The duration of pneumoperitoneum was positively correlated with the MEAD.

94004,Protecting frontline workers and their patients from infection.,2020-06-25,"PURPOSE To investigate and compare the anatomical success rates and complications of the treatment modalities for small saphenous vein (SSV) incompetence. METHODS A systematic literature search was performed in PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library on the following therapies for incompetence of SSVs: surgery, endovenous laser ablation (EVLA), radiofrequency ablation (RFA), ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy (UGFS), steam ablation, and mechanochemical endovenous ablation (MOCA). The search found 49 articles (5 randomized controlled trials, 44 cohort studies) reporting on the different treatment modalities: surgery (n=9), EVLA (n=28), RFA (n=9), UGFS (n=6), and MOCA (n=1). A random-effects model was used to estimate the primary outcome of anatomical success, which was defined as closure of the treated vein on follow-up duplex ultrasound imaging. The estimate is reported with the 95% confidence interval (CI). Secondary outcomes were technical success and major complications [paresthesia and deep vein thrombosis (DVT)], given as the weighted means. RESULTS The pooled anatomical success rate was 58.0% (95% CI 40.9% to 75.0%) for surgery in 798 SSVs, 98.5% (95% CI 97.7% to 99.2%) for EVLA in 2950 SSVs, 97.1% (95% CI 94.3% to 99.9%) for RFA in 386 SSVs, and 63.6% (95% CI 47.1% to 80.1%) for UGFS in 494 SSVs. One study reported results of MOCA, with an anatomical success rate of 94%. Neurologic complications were most frequently reported after surgery (mean 19.6%) and thermal ablation (EVLA: mean 4.8%; RFA: mean 9.7%). Deep venous thrombosis was a rare complication (0% to 1.2%). CONCLUSION Endovenous thermal ablation (EVLA/RFA) should be preferred to surgery and foam sclerotherapy in the treatment of SSV incompetence. Although data on nonthermal techniques in SSV are still sparse, the potential benefits, especially the reduced risk of nerve injury, might be of considerable clinical importance.","Boersma, Doeke; Kornmann, Verena N N; van Eekeren, Ramon R J P; Tromp, Ellen; Ünlü, Çagdas; Reijnen, Michel M J P; de Vries, Jean-Paul P M",Journal of endovascular therapy : an official journal of the International Society of Endovascular Specialists,https://doi.org/10.1177/1526602815616375; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26564912/,472
99384,Whether COVID-19 lockdown in Delhi and Kolkata improved the ambient air quality of the two cities?,2021-01-07,"The repair of hernias through iliac crest defects is challenging secondary to the inherent weakness of the abdominal musculature and the rigidity of the pelvis. The defect is surrounded by inadequate tissue to properly buttress the repair. Full-thickness tricortical bone harvested from the iliac may result in an incisional hernia through the bony defect. Options for repair include using the aponeurosis of the gluteus muscle, prosthetic material, or straightening the iliac crest. We report two patients who had their defects repaired laparoscopically using polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) mesh. Two patients with hernias following full-thickness iliac crest bone harvest presented secondary to increasing pain and size of their hernias. Both defects were repaired laparoscopically using spiral tacks laterally, medially, and superiorly, and with an intracorporeal stitch inferiorly at the iliac crest to secure the mesh. The two defects averaged 24.5 cm(2) in size and were repaired with PTFE mesh. For adequate visualization, the cecum was mobilized and the mesh repair overlapped the defects by a 4-cm margin. Both patients were discharged after 2.5 days. There were no infectious or neurologic complications, and neither patient has recurred. The laparoscopic approach to the repair of hernias resulting from tricortical iliac crest bone harvest is safe and may be preferable to open repair.

Each technique has its advantages and disadvantages; however, how morbidity relates to satisfaction is not well-understood. Our aim was to compare complications and patient-reported outcomes following pedicled TRAM (pTRAM), free TRAM (fTRAM), and DIEP flaps to guide flap selection. Methods A systematic literature search was conducted, and 2 independent reviewers identified comparative studies of abdominally based flaps. Data were extracted on patient characteristics, complications, and patient-reported outcomes. Meta-analyses were conducted using random effects modeling with the DerSimonian and Laird method. Results The search retrieved 5090 articles, of which 18 were included in this review. pTRAM flaps trended toward a higher risk of abdominal bulge/hernia compared with DIEP flaps, particularly in low-volume hospitals. While fTRAM flaps had a higher risk of abdominal morbidity compared with DIEP flaps, relative risk decreased when obese patients were excluded and when only muscle-sparing fTRAM flaps were compared. Muscle-sparing flaps had a higher risk of flap loss than fTRAM flaps. Compared with DIEP flaps, pTRAM flaps were associated with lower general satisfaction but comparable emotional well-being. Conclusions Our findings indicate that safety and satisfaction following abdominally based breast reconstruction depend on flap type and patient characteristics. When possible, DIEP or muscle-sparing fTRAM flaps should be performed for obese patients to decrease the risk of abdominal bulge/hernia. Although pTRAM flaps are associated with a greater risk of flap loss, they are still an appropriate option when microsurgery is not available.","He, Waverley Y; El Eter, Leen; Yesantharao, Pooja; Hung, Bethany; Owens, Haley; Persing, Sarah; Sacks, Justin M",Plastic and reconstructive surgery.

CEUS, CT/MR-CEUS, and 3DUS-CEUS FI techniques were randomly used to assist HCC ablation. All lesions were ablated according to a previously determined plan, and FI groups required a 5-mm ablative margin. The primary endpoints were technical efficacy of thermal ablation and local tumor progression (LTP).Results: According to randomization, 153 (18.8 ± 8.0 cm), 153 (18.3 ± 6.6 cm) and 150 (19.1 ± 6.9 cm) HCCs were assigned to CT/MR-CEUS, 3DUS-CEUS and CEUS groups respectively. Technical efficacy rates (99.3% vs. 100% vs. 100%) were achieved in the three groups, showing no statistical differences (p = 1.000). The median follow-up time was 24 (1-37) months. LTP rates at 1 and 2 years were 3.4%, 12.2% for CT/MR-CEUS FI, 4.8%, 9.0% for 3DUS-CEUS FI, and 8.6%, 19.9% for CEUS, respectively (p = .105). The results of subgroup analysis for LTP were statistically significant when patients with albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) grade 2 and 3 (p = .000), and tumor located at risky positions (p = .042). In addition, the p value in group of multiple tumors was close to .05 (p = .052).Conclusions: All the three techniques are feasible for intraoperative HCC thermal ablation.

This study aimed to examine changes in pediatric healthcare utilization in Hunan Province, China, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods An electronic survey was conducted among 142 hospitals in Hunan Province, China. Using data from January 1 to April 30, 2019 as a reference, the changes in the number of visits for different types of pediatric healthcare between January 1 and April 30, 2020 were calculated. Changes in the number of admissions for infections and injuries were also evaluated. Results The total number of pediatric healthcare presentations decreased by 53.3% in the first four months of 2020. The most remarkable reductions were observed in the utilization of emergency room (ranging from -45.7% to -94.9% among three hospital levels) and observation room (-55.8% to -77.7%); neonatal inpatient care experienced the smallest decreases (-21.2% to -25.5%). Approximately 85% of the total reduction in the number of pediatric inpatient admissions was attributable to the reduction in admissions for infections. A 13.3% increase in the number of admissions for injuries was observed among third-level hospitals. Conclusions The utilization of all types of pediatric healthcare services in Hunan Province declined markedly after the outbreak of COVID-19. The reasons, consequences, and responses to these changes should be addressed in future studies and actions.","Yan, Haipeng; Li, Xun; Lu, Xiulan; Zeng, Saizhen; Yuan, Yuanhong; Hu, Xian; Zhu, Yimin; Xiao, Zhenghui",Translational pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.21037/tp-20-465; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34012836/,472

Surgical branch pulmonary artery angioplasty is associated with a high reintervention rate. As an alternative, percutaneous or intraoperative branch pulmonary artery stents have been implanted to improve efficiency, but long-term evaluations are limited. AIM To describe the long-term evolution of branch pulmonary artery stents. METHODS We conducted a retrospective cohort study at Tours University Hospital. All stents implanted by surgery or catheterization in branch pulmonary arteries with a minimum follow-up of 12 months and at least one catheterization control were included. The primary endpoint combined cardiovascular mortality, surgical or percutaneous reintervention for stent complication or new stent implantation. RESULTS Between 2007 and 2017, 76 stents in 51 patients were included (62 stents implanted by surgery, 14 by catheterization). At implantation, the patients' mean age and weight were 4.7years (interquartile range 4.2years) and 17.3kg (interquartile range 11.0kg), respectively. Mean branch pulmonary artery minimum diameter was 4.1±2.1mm (mean Z-score-4.9±2.9), and mean initial stent diameter was 9.1±3.1mm. During a follow-up of 5.3years (range 0-11.2 years), freedom from primary endpoint was 86.8% (95% confidence interval 79.6-94.8%) at 1 year, 71.5% (95% confidence interval 61.9-82.7%) at 5years and 69.6% (95% confidence interval 59.6-81.2%) at 10 years. We did not identify any factors associated with major adverse cardiovascular events. Among stents without major adverse cardiovascular events, the mean branch pulmonary artery diameter Z-score at last evaluation had increased by +4.8±3.2 compared with the initial diameter (P<0.001). After stent implantation, a median of 2 re-expansions were performed for each stent (range 0-7). CONCLUSIONS Stent implantation should offer a good long-term solution for branch pulmonary artery stenosis, although iterative re-expansions are required.","Ma, Iris; El Arid, Jean-Marc; Neville, Paul; Soule, Nathalie; Dion, Fanny; Poinsot, Jacques; Chantepie, Alain; Lefort, Bruno",Archives of cardiovascular diseases,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acvd.2020.05.016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32917562/,472

The mechanism involves the deregulation of the multicistronic latency transcript, including the failure to generate the mature forms of viral mRNA encoding LANA. We show here that GA disrupts an RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) complex that accumulates at the CTCF-cohesin binding site within the first intron of the latency transcript. GA altered the enrichment of the RNAPII pausing complex, along with pausing factors SPT5 and NELF-A, at the intragenic CTCF-cohesin binding sites. GA blocked the interaction of cohesin subunit SMC3 with another cohesin subunit, RAD21, and reduced SPT5 interaction with RNAPII. Covalent coupling of GA to a solid support revealed that GA interacts with several cellular proteins, including SMC3 and SPT5, but not their respective interaction partners RAD21 and RNAPII. GA treatment also inhibited the transcription of some cellular genes, like c-myc, which contain a similar CTCF-cohesin binding site within the first intron. We also found that GA leads to a more general loss of sister chromatid cohesion for cellular chromosomes. These findings suggest that RNAPII pauses at intragenic CTCF-cohesin binding sites and that abrogation of this pausing by GA leads to loss of proper mRNA production and defects in sister chromatid cohesion, a process important for both viral and cellular chromosome stability.","Kang, Hyojeung; Lieberman, Paul M",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00720-11; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21880767/,472

Emerging evidence indicates that competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) are involved in various diseases, however, the regulatory mechanisms of ceRNAs underlying HNSCC remain unclear. In this study, we retrieved differentially expressed long non-coding RNAs (DElncRNAs), messenger RNAs (DEmRNAs) and microRANs (DEmiRNAs) from The Cancer Genome Atlas database and constructed a ceRNA-based risk model in HNSCC by integrated bioinformatics approaches.

128305,Assessment of Online Education: Part 1.,2020,"OBJECTIVES The retail food industry, a major essential business, is among the very few thriving sectors during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, such prosperity on the store side does not guarantee a sufficient food supply for all populations. This study aims to understand if people's risk perception and food security status shaped their food procurement behaviors during the early outbreak of the pandemic. STUDY DESIGN Extended from the theory of risk perception, food consumers may behave differently during a disastrous event in terms of store patronization. The study evaluates how food procurement behaviors are affected by perceived risk aversion, resource scarcity, and consumers' food security status. METHODS The study examines how people with different food security statuses made grocery shopping decisions at the risk of epidemic exposure based on a nationwide survey of 2590 participants in the U.S. during the early break of the pandemic in April 2020. The study uses a moderated mediation analysis on in-store shopping frequency and food expenditure. RESULTS People having a food-secure status before the pandemic spent significantly more as a result of the reduced shopping frequency (i.e., the secure-insecure subgroup β = -0.18, P < .01; the secure-secure subgroup β = -0.35, P < .01). The increase in food expenditure was insignificant for people who were food-insecure before the pandemic (i.e., the insecure-insecure subgroup, β = -0.01, P > .05; the insecure-secure subgroup, β = -0.11, P > .05). CONCLUSIONS The study reports that in general people reduced the frequency of grocery shopping trips to avoid epidemic exposure while increasing the food expenditure per trip. The increase in food expenditure was not statistically significant among the food-insecure populations likely due to their budget constraints.","Wang, Y; Chen, X; Yang, Y; Cui, Y; Xu, R",Public health,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2021.04.020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34126399/,472

Swine do not become fully immunologically competent until about 4 weeks of age, which means that their compromised ability to respond to infectious agents during the first month of life must be supplemented by maternal immune components: (1) circulating antibodies derived from colostrum; (2) mucosal antibodies from colostrum and milk; and (3) immune cells provided in mammary secretions. Because maternal immunity is highly effective at protecting piglets against specific pathogens, strengthening sow herd immunity against certain diseases through exposure or vaccination is a useful management tool for ameliorating clinical effects in piglets and delaying infection until the piglets' immune system is better prepared to respond. In this review, we discuss the anatomy and physiology of lactation, the immune functions of components provided to neonatal swine in mammary secretion, the importance of maternal immunity in the prevention and control of significant pathogens.","Poonsuk, Korakrit; Zimmerman, Jeff",Animal health research reviews,https://doi.org/10.1017/s1466252317000123; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29125097/,472

Outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), bird flu, and swine flu posing pandemic threats have compelled health agencies to follow global preparedness for combating the emerging deadly pathogens. The outbreak in West Africa of highly contagious Ebola viral disease (EVD) that started in Guinea in December 2013, assumed global proportions to become the largest outbreak of EVD and the most prominent international health concern. With fatality rates of nearly 50%-90%, it has claimed, as of 11 April 2015, 10,619 human lives out of a total of 25,626 cases reported worldwide. Ebola virus (EBOV), a member of Filoviridae family, is associated with severe, often lethal, hemorrhagic fever disease in humans and animals. The animal hosts, including non-human primates and reservoir hosts (fruit bats), play a significant role in transmission and maintenance of EBOV in nature. Although no approved vaccine for the prevention of EVD currently exists, disease control can be greatly enhanced by timely laboratory confirmation through blood tests using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Adherence to strict sanitary and hygienic measures, monitoring and surveillance of EBOV, as well as quarantine checks on international trade, transport, and visitors from affected countries are mandatory to prevent and control the spread of EVD. This review describes the salient properties of EBOV and the development of novel diagnostics, vaccines, and control strategies for this emerging disease of high public health concern and international emergency.","Dhama, Kuldeep; Malik, Yashpal Singh; Malik, Satya Veer Singh; Singh, Raj Kumar",Journal of infection in developing countries,https://doi.org/10.3855/jidc.6197; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25989163/,472

The disease is caused by a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 and on February 11, 2020, was officially named Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization. Within few weeks, it has spread globally to the extent that World Health Organization declared it as a global pandemic on March 11, 2020. India's first positive case was reported on January 30th in Kerala. Before March 3rd, India had 3 cases of coronavirus in Kerala all of which were treated and discharged. On March 3rd, India's 4th case was diagnosed in the state of Rajasthan. Indian government had announced a number of preventive measures to minimize the entry and spread of coronavirus. On March 3rd, India announced the suspension of all visas issued to Italy, Iran, South Korea and Japan. India banned international flights from March 22nd. A 21-day lockdown across the country was imposed from March 26th, which later got further extended. Rigorous contact tracing and tracking of COVID patients and monitoring home quarantine helped in preventing community transmission. The aim of this work is to describe the experience with clinical and epidemiologic features, as well as with the management of COVID-19 patients in north India. This is a descriptive study of the 17 COVID-19 infected patients confirmed with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and admitted to a tertiary care centre in India from March 11th 2020 to April 16th 2020. The present work also provides insight in to treatment provided and final outcome of the patients infected with COVID-19 in India.

133791,Increased ozone pollution alongside reduced nitrogen dioxide concentrations during Vienna's first COVID-19 lockdown: Significance for air quality management.,2021-04-15,"BACKGROUND Kawasaki disease (KD) is a febrile illness of unknown etiology. Patients with Kawasaki disease shock syndrome (KDSS) may present with clinical signs of poor perfusion and systolic hypotension in addition to typical KD features. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention analyzes and interprets large hospitalization databases as a mechanism for conducting national KD surveillance. METHODS The Kids' Inpatient Database (KID), the National (Nationwide) Inpatient Sample (NIS), and the IBM MarketScan Commercial (MSC) and MarketScan Medicaid (MSM) databases were analyzed to determine KD-associated hospitalization rates and trends from 2006 to the most recent year of available data. KD and potential KDSS hospitalizations were defined using International Classification of Disease-Clinical Modification codes. RESULTS For the most recent year, the KD-associated hospitalization rates for children <5 years of age were 19.8 (95% CI: 17.2-22.3, KID: 2016), 19.6 (95% CI: 16.8-22.4, NIS: 2017), 19.3 (MSC: 2018), and 18.4 (MSM: 2018) per 100,000. There was no indication of an increase in KD rates over the time period. Rates of potential KDSS among children <18 years of age, ranging from 0.0 to 0.7 per 100,000, increased; coding indicated potential KDSS for approximately 2.8%-5.3% of KD hospitalizations. CONCLUSIONS Analyses of these large, national databases produced consistent KD-associated hospitalization rates, with no increase over time detected; however, the percentage of KD hospitalizations with potential KDSS increased. Given reports of increasing incidence elsewhere and the recent identification of a novel virus-associated syndrome with possible Kawasaki-like features, continued national surveillance is important to detect changes in disease epidemiology.","Maddox, Ryan A; Person, Marissa K; Kennedy, Jordan L; Leung, Jessica; Abrams, Joseph Y; Haberling, Dana L; Schonberger, Lawrence B; Belay, Ermias D",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,https://doi.org/10.1097/inf.0000000000002982; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33264213/,472

PATIENTS AND METHODS PTC TPC-1 cells and human normal thyroid follicular epithelial cells Nthy-ori 3-1 were collected to identify the expression of RET in PTC. Seven groups were divided according to different transfection protocols, including blank group, negative control group, si-RET group, oe-RET group, AG-490 group, NSC 228155 group, and si-RET + NSC 228155 group. After transfection, qRT-PCR was used to identify whether the transfection was successful or not. qRT-PCR and Western blot were performed to detect the mRNA and protein expressions of RET, EGFR signaling pathway related genes, and EMT related genes. Cell migration, invasion, proliferation and apoptosis abilities were further detected by CCK8, cell scratch, transwell and flow cytometry assays, respectively. RESULTS RET gene was highly expressed in PTC cells (p<0.05). Compared with blank group, oe-RET group and NSC 228155 group had activated EGFR signaling pathway manifesting in the increased expression of EGFR, p-Src, p-FAK, accelerated EMT showing in the increased expression of N-cadherin and Vimentin expression, but decreased E-cadherin expression, increased cell migration, invasion and proliferation, while decreased apoptosis (all p<0.05); si-RET group and AG-490 group had inhibited activation of EGFR signaling pathway, suppressed EMT, decreased cell migration, invasion and proliferation, while increased apoptosis (all p<0.05); while no evident difference was found in si-RET + NSC 228155 group (all p>0.05). Meanwhile, compared with si-RET group, si-RET + NSC 228155 group showed activated EGFR signaling pathway, accelerated EMT, increased abilities of cell migration, invasion and proliferation, while decreased apoptosis (all p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS RET gene is highly expressed in PTC acting as an oncogene. Silencing RET gene expression may inhibit the invasion and promote the apoptosis of PTC cells by inhibiting the activation of EGFR signaling pathway and mediating the process of EMT. It suggests that RET may offer the possibility of a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of PTC on the basis of the explored mechanism.","Zhao, Y-L; Yuan, B-Q; Shen, G-S",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202008_22487; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32767330/,472

Reply.,2021-02-10,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE A noninvasive investigation with high spatial resolution and without metal artifacts is necessary for long-term imaging follow-up after flow-diverter implantation. We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic value of conebeam CT angiography with intravenous contrast enhancement in the assessment of vascular status following implantation of the Pipeline Embolization Device and to analyze the preliminary results of vascular status following long-term Pipeline Embolization Device implantation. MATERIALS AND METHODS This was an ongoing prospective study of consecutive patients with intracranial aneurysms treated with the Pipeline Embolization Device. Patients with a modified Rankin Scale score of 4-5 were excluded. The median and interquartile range of the time interval of Pipeline Embolization Device implantation to conebeam CT angiography with intravenous contrast enhancement were 56.6 and 42.9-62.4 months, respectively. Conebeam CT angiography with intravenous contrast enhancement was performed with the patient fully conscious, by using a C-arm CT with a flat panel detector. RESULTS There were 34 patients and 34 vascular segments. In all 34 cases, contrast effect and image quality were good and not substantially different from those of intra-arterial conebeam CTA. Metal artifacts occurred in all 14 cases with coil masses; the Pipeline Embolization Device was obscured in 3 cases. In all 34 cases, there was no residual aneurysm, no vascular occlusion, 1 vascular stenosis (50%), good Pipeline Embolization Device apposition to the vessel, and no Pipeline Embolization Device-induced calcification. All 28 Pipeline Embolization Device-covered side branches were patent. CONCLUSIONS Conebeam CT angiography with intravenous contrast enhancement is potentially promising and useful for effective evaluation of the vascular status following intracranial flow diverters. The Pipeline Embolization Device for intracranial aneurysms is probably safe and promising for long-term placement, with favorable morphologic outcome and without delayed complications.","Yu, S C H; Lee, K T; Lau, T W W; Wong, G K C; Pang, V K Y; Chan, K Y",AJNR.

STUDY DESIGN Cultured HSA cells were added to canine blood to simulate intraoperative hemorrhage and address hemoabdomen from ruptured splenic HSA. The blood/HSA cell mixture was processed through an IOCS, followed by LRF processing. SAMPLE POPULATION Whole blood from 3 healthy dogs combined with cultured HSA cells. METHODS The ability of quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), multiparameter flow cytometry, and cytologic examination to detect 50 HSA cells per milliliter of culture media was confirmed. RT-PCR, multiparameter flow cytometry, and cytologic examination were used to determine the presence of cultured HSA cells at 4 points during processing. RESULTS HSA cells were found in all control samples and in all samples after IOCS but prior to LRF processing with all 3 cell detection methods. HSA cells were not found after IOCS/LRF processing with all 3 cell detection methods. CONCLUSION IOCS combined with LRF processing is able to remove cultured HSA cells from canine blood. The addition of LRF to IOCS may allow application of IOCS in dogs with HSA. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE A combination of IOCS and LRF processing may provide an alternative to allogeneic blood transfusion in dogs with hemoabdomen due to HSA.","Ciepluch, Brittany; Wilson-Robles, Heather; Levine, Gwendolyn; Smith, Roger; Wright, Gus A; Miller, Tasha; O'Brien, Maureen T; Thieman Mankin, Kelley M",Veterinary surgery : VS,https://doi.org/10.1111/vsu.12760; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29247544/,472

DESIGN Observational study. SETTING We tested the hypothesis that community-living older people who are screened positive for sarcopenia using the SARC-F tool but without a history of heart failure (HF) have a higher prevalence of cardiac abnormalities compared with those who are SARC-F negative. PARTICIPANTS Participants were recruited from a territory-wide primary care needs assessment for older people based in community centres, and from non-acute hospitals in the same region as the study centre. MEASUREMENTS Participants with a total score of >=4 and who did not have any history of HF were invited to attend for further cardiac assessment. Grip strength, walking speed, and the 6-minute walk test and echocardiography were carried out. Patients with frailty and at least Grade II diastolic dysfunction were considered to have heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) if they also had concomitant elevated N-terminal prohormone of B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) of at least 300 pg/ml. RESULTS Diastolic dysfunction (DD) was significantly associated with SARC-F score >=4 and higher circulating NT-proBNP levels. ROC curves evaluating the predictive values of SARC-F, HGS and gait speed for DD showed that a combination of SARC-F and HGS or gait speed provided significant incremental value in predicting DD. CONCLUSIONS Community living older people with sarcopenia detected using a simple questionnaire have a higher prevalence of DD accompanied by elevated NT proBNP. Addition of hand grip strength or walking speed improve the magnitude of the association. SARC-F may be used as a tool to detect early cardiac dysfunction in the community.","Yang, X; Woo, J; Ting Lui, L; Li, Q; Fai Cheng, K; Fan, Y; Yau, F; Lee, A P W; Lee, J S W; Fung, E","The journal of nutrition, health & aging",https://doi.org/10.1007/s12603-020-1358-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346685/,472

145909,Guest editorial.,2017,"Spiking neural networks (SNNs) sharing large similarity with biological nervous systems are promising to process spatiotemporal information and can provide highly time- and energy-efficient computational paradigms for the Internet-of-Things and edge computing. Nonvolatile electrolyte-gated transistors (EGTs) provide prominent analog switching performance, the most critical feature of synaptic element, and have been recently demonstrated as a promising synaptic device. However, high performance, large-scale EGT arrays, and EGT application for spatiotemporal information processing in an SNN are yet to be demonstrated. Here, an oxide-based EGT employing amorphous Nb2 O5 and Lix SiO2 is introduced as the channel and electrolyte gate materials, respectively, and integrated into a 32 × 32 EGT array. The engineered EGTs show a quasi-linear update, good endurance (106 ) and retention, a high switching speed of 100 ns, ultralow readout conductance (<100 nS), and ultralow areal switching energy density (20 fJ µm-2 ). The prominent analog switching performance is leveraged for hardware implementation of an SNN with the capability of spatiotemporal information processing, where spike sequences with different timings are able to be efficiently learned and recognized by the EGT array. Finally, this EGT-based spatiotemporal information processing is deployed to detect moving orientation in a tactile sensing system. These results provide an insight into oxide-based EGT devices for energy-efficient neuromorphic computing to support edge application.","Li, Yue; Lu, Jikai; Shang, Dashan; Liu, Qi; Wu, Shuyu; Wu, Zuheng; Zhang, Xumeng; Yang, Jianguo; Wang, Zhongrui; Lv, Hangbing; Liu, Ming",Advanced materials,https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202003018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33079425/,472

Here we discuss the widely spread paradigm that the charges determining the channel selectivity are only those that can be considered solvent-accessible because of their location near the permeation pathways of ions and water molecules. Theoretical predictions for the electric potential and average ion densities inside the pore are presented using several approaches of increasing resolution: from analytical and numerical solutions of electrostatic equations in a model channel up to all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and continuum electrostatic calculations performed in a particular biological channel, the bacterial porin OmpF. The results highlight the role of protein dieletric properties and the importance of the initial choice of the residue ionization states in the understanding of the molecular basis of large channel selectivity irrespective of the level of resolution of the computational approach used.","García-Giménez, Elena; Alcaraz, Antonio; Aguilella-Arzo, Marcel; Aguilella, Vicente M",The journal of physical chemistry.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate respiratory therapist extenders' comfort level with critical care ventilators while caring for patients with COVID-19. To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the deployment of certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNAs) in a critical care setting. METHODS A qualitative survey method was used to assess CRNA experience with critical care ventilators. Prior to deployment in the ICU, CRNAs were trained by clinical lead respiratory therapists. Education included respiratory clinical practices and ventilator management. Sixty-minute sessions were held with demonstration stations set up in ICUs for hands-on experience. RESULTS Fifty-six CRNAs responded to our survey (63%). A mean ± SD of 9.48 ± 12.27 h was spent training prior to deployment in the ICU. CRNAs were at the bedside a mean ± SD of 72.96 ± 40.59 h during the pandemic. While CRNA comfort level with critical care ventilators increased significantly (P < .001) from the beginning to the end of their work experience, no statistically significant differences were found between CRNA comfort based on years of experience. Differences in comfort level were not found after training (chi-squared test 23.82, P = .09) or after ICU experience was completed (chi-squared test = 15.99, P = .45). Similarly, mean comfort level did not increase based on the number of hours spent working in the ICU (chi-squared test = 13.67, P = .55). CONCLUSIONS Comfort level with mechanical ventilation increased for respiratory therapist extenders working alongside respiratory therapists during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Roberts, Karsten J; Johnson, Bridgette; Morgan, Heather M; Vrontisis, Jody M; Young, Katie M; Czerpak, Edward; Fuchs, Barry D; Pierce, Margie",Respiratory care,https://doi.org/10.4187/respcare.08459; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33323412/,472
156784,Improvement in air quality and its impact on land surface temperature in major urban areas across India during the first lockdown of the pandemic.,2021-05-21,"BACKGROUND Randomized, clinical trials in selected acute ischemic stroke patients reported that for every hour delay of endovascular treatment (EVT), chances of functional independence diminish by up to 3.4%. These findings may not be fully generalizable to clinical practice because of strict in- and exclusion criteria in these trials. Therefore, we aim to assess the association of time to EVT with functional outcome in current, everyday clinical practice. METHODS The MR CLEAN Registry (Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of Endovascular Treatment for Acute Ischemic Stroke in The Netherlands) is an ongoing, prospective, observational study in all centers that perform EVT in The Netherlands. Data were analyzed from patients treated between March 2014 and June 2016. In the primary analysis we assessed the association of time from stroke onset to start of EVT and time from stroke onset to successful reperfusion with functional outcome (measured with the modified Rankin Scale), by means of ordinal logistic regression. RESULTS We analyzed 1488 patients with acute ischemic stroke who underwent EVT. An increased time to start of EVT was associated with worse functional outcome (adjusted common odds ratio, 0.83 per hour; 95% confidence interval, 0.77-0.89) and a 2.2% increase in mortality. Every hour increase from stroke onset to EVT start resulted in a 5.3% decreased probability of functional independence (modified Rankin Scale, 0-2). In the 742 patients with successful reperfusion, every hour increase from stroke onset to reperfusion was associated with a 7.7% decreased probability of functional independence. CONCLUSIONS Time to EVT for acute ischemic stroke in current clinical practice is strongly associated with functional outcome. Our data suggest that this association might be even stronger than previously suggested in reports on more selected patient populations from randomized, controlled trials. These findings emphasize that functional outcome of EVT patients can be greatly improved by shortening onset to treatment times.","Mulder, Maxim J H L; Jansen, Ivo G H; Goldhoorn, Robert-Jan B; Venema, Esmee; Chalos, Vicky; Compagne, Kars C J; Roozenbeek, Bob; Lingsma, Hester F; Schonewille, Wouter J; van den Wijngaard, Ido R; Boiten, Jelis; Albert Vos, Jan; Roos, Yvo B W Em; van Oostenbrugge, Robert J; van Zwam, Wim H; Majoie, Charles B L M; van der Lugt, Aad; Dippel, Diederik W J",Circulation,https://doi.org/10.1161/circulationaha.117.032600; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29581124/,472

Although the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is a common TMS target for treating clinical depression as well as modulating pain, little is known about whether TMS over this area may affect perceived controllability. The present study explored the immediate effects of fast TMS over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex on the analgesic effects of perceived pain controllability. Twenty-four healthy volunteers underwent a laboratory pain task designed to manipulate perception of pain controllability. Real TMS, compared with sham, suppressed the analgesic benefits of perceived control on the emotional dimension of pain, but not the sensory/discriminatory dimension. Findings suggest that, at least acutely, fast TMS over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex may interrupt the perceived-controllability effect on the emotional dimension of pain experience. Although it is not clear whether this cortical area is directly involved with modulating perceived controllability or whether downstream effects are responsible for the present findings, it appears possible that left dorsolateral prefrontal TMS may produce analgesic effects by acting through a cortical perceived-control circuit regulating limbic and brainstem areas of the pain circuit. Despite evidence that prefrontal TMS can have analgesic effects, fast left prefrontal TMS appears to acutely suppress analgesia associated with perceived-control. This effect may be limited to the emotional dimension of pain experience.","Borckardt, Jeffrey J; Reeves, Scott T; Frohman, Heather; Madan, Alok; Jensen, Mark P; Patterson, David; Barth, Kelly; Smith, A Richard; Gracely, Richard; George, Mark S",Pain,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pain.2010.10.018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21122992/,472
160188,The complement system in COVID-19: friend and foe?,2020-06-18,"ABSTRACT BACKGROUND: The emergence of neuroscience intensive care units (NSICUs) for the past decades has led to growing interest in targeted training for NSICU nurses. We sought to evaluate the use of video instruction on NSICU nurses' skills in case presentations and neurological examinations, which has timely advantages as an asynchronous and distanced learning modality. METHODS: We enrolled NSICU and surgical intensive care unit nurses who took shifts in the NSICU at our institution. Participants were observed by a neurocritical care attending physician presenting the clinical details of an admitted patient and conducting a neurological examination, with both parties completing a 10-item evaluation on NSICU nursing presentation and examination skills. Participants randomized to an intervention group were given access to an instructional video on NSICU nursing skills. A median of 21 days later, participants were observed by a physician blinded to study randomization, with both parties recompleting the evaluation. Differences between day 1 and day 21 scores were analyzed using paired sample t tests. RESULTS: Fifteen NSICU and 55 surgical intensive care unit nurses were enrolled. Surgical intensive care unit nurses in both the intervention and control groups had statistically significant improvement between day 1 and day 21 physician-rated scores, with a greater increase in the intervention group; self-rated scores did not change. For NSICU nurses, there were no differences in physician-rated or self-rated scores for either group. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical intensive care unit nurses who underwent direct observation and self-evaluation had improvement in physician-rated NSICU nursing skills, likely as these activities allowed for reflective observation in Kolb's experiential learning cycle. Greater improvement in participants who viewed an instructional video highlights its value as a teaching modality for nurses.","Lau, K H Vincent; Hamlyn, Emily; Williams, Thomas James; Qureshi, M Mustafa; Mak, Kimberley; Mian, Asim; Cervantes-Arslanian, Anna; Zhu, Shuhan; Takahashi, Courtney",The Journal of neuroscience nursing : journal of the American Association of Neuroscience Nurses,https://doi.org/10.1097/jnn.0000000000000591; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33840806/,472
161043,David Oliver: How not to do covid-19 comms-copy our government.,2020-10-21,"Objective Studies suggest female physicians experience higher rates of infertility than the general population. The overall objective of this study was to determine the rate of impaired fecundity in a sample of female emergency physicians and compare it to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) data. Impaired fecundity is defined as physical difficulty in getting pregnant or carrying a pregnancy to live birth. Methods We performed a cross-sectional survey of female emergency physicians to determine the rate of impaired fecundity. Survey questions were adapted from the NSFG to allow comparison to the general population. Statistical comparisons were made using contingency tables (with chi-square and tau-c assessments), 1-sample t tests, and independent samples t tests, as appropriate. Results A total of 2072 women completed the survey with a mean (SD) current age of 38.9 (7.2) years. Data were analyzed for women of childbearing years (15-44 years old as defined by the CDC; n = 1705 [82% total responses]). The rate of impaired fecundity in emergency physicians was 24.9% as compared to the NSFG cohort (12.1%; P < 0.001). Female emergency physicians with impaired fecundity reported working 9.8 overall more clinical hours (95% CI 2.5-17) and 4.5 more night hours (95% CI 0.8-8.2) than those with normal fecundity. Conclusion Female emergency physicians have increased rates of impaired fecundity when compared with a general population cohort. Clinical workload and night shifts are greater in female emergency physicians with impaired fecundity. Research is needed to elucidate work-related impaired fecundity risk factors.","Parsons, Melissa; Kalynych, Colleen; Johns, Tracy L; Scicchitano, Michael J; Lott, Michelle; Fernandez, Rosemarie",Journal of the American College of Emergency Physicians open,https://doi.org/10.1002/emp2.12170; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33145554/,472
162325,Air Pollutant Levels during the Large-scale Social Restriction Period and its Association with Case Fatality Rate of COVID-19,2021,"Cardiac progenitor cells including c-kit(+) cells and cardiosphere-derived cells (CDCs) play important roles in cardiac repair and regeneration. CDCs were reported to contain only small subpopulations of c-kit(+) cells and recent publications suggested that depletion of the c-kit(+) subpopulation of cells has no effect on regenerative properties of CDCs. However, our current study showed that the vast majority of CDCs from murine heart actually express c-kit, albeit, in an intracellular and non-glycosylated form. Immunostaining and flow cytometry showed that the fluorescent signal indicative of c-kit immunostaining significantly increased when cell membranes were permeabilized. Western blots further demonstrated that glycosylation of c-kit was increased during endothelial differentiation in a time dependent manner. Glycosylation inhibition by 1-deoxymannojirimycin hydrochloride (1-DMM) blocked c-kit glycosylation and reduced expression of endothelial cell markers such as Flk-1 and CD31 during differentiation. Pretreatment of these cells with a c-kit kinase inhibitor (imatinib mesylate) also attenuated Flk-1 and CD31 expression. These results suggest that c-kit glycosylation and its kinase activity are likely needed for these cells to differentiate into an endothelial lineage. In vivo, we found that intracellular c-kit expressing cells are located in the wall of cardiac blood vessels in mice subjected to myocardial infarction. In summary, our work demonstrated for the first time that c-kit is not only expressed in CDCs but may also directly participate in CDC differentiation into an endothelial lineage.","Shi, Huilin; Drummond, Christopher A; Fan, Xiaoming; Haller, Steven T; Liu, Jiang; Malhotra, Deepak; Tian, Jiang",Stem cell research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scr.2016.04.017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27161312/,472
162422,The role of digital transformation in development in Egypt,2021,"OBJECTIVE Patients with 2019-nCoV infection have a high risk to develop venous thrombotic events. Several guidelines recommend the use of either unfractionated heparin or low molecular weight heparins in preventing thrombotic events in these patients. However, results from clinical studies, so far published, reached controversial conclusions on heparin efficacy in this kind of patients since the incidence of venous thromboembolism remains high despite prophylaxis. This narrative review aims to provide an overview of the antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties of heparins and their efficacy and safety in SARS-CoV-2 medical ward-patients. Moreover, anatomical findings and ongoing trials are also reported. Finally, this narrative review tries to explain why heparins fail to prevent venous thrombosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS We searched for the most relevant published studies on heparins and 2019-nCoV infected patients using the MEDLINE electronic database in the period between January and December 2020. Articles were preliminarily defined as eligible if they: a) were in English language, b) enrolled 250 or more medical ward-patients and 100 or more ICU-patients, c) reported results on patients treated with heparins in a percentage of at least 70% and d) performed an objectively confirmed diagnosis of VTE. RESULTS Data from medium to large scientific studies show that the incidence of venous thrombotic events in medical ward-patients with SARS-CoV-2 vary between 0% and 8.3%, while this rate is higher, from 6.2% to 49%, in Intensive Care Unit-patients. However, heparins reduce the mortality rate in these patients of about 50%. Histological findings show that thrombosis could affect capillaries, main and small-mid-sized vessels, and it is associated with diffuse alveolar damage. CONCLUSIONS Heparins have anti-inflammatory and anti-viral properties, which may be of help in reducing mortality in SARS-CoV-2 patients. Failure of heparins at prophylactic dosages in preventing VTE, especially in ICU-patients, could be due to the severity of the disease. Data on the use of heparins in an early phase of the 2019-nCoV infection are still lacking.","Barcellona, D; Fanni, D; Gerosa, C; Congiu, T; Orrù, G; Faa, G; Marongiu, F",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202105_25842; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34002834/,472

The current pulse contour method estimates left ventricle stroke volume. Heart-lung interactions change right ventricular stroke volume acutely. We investigated the accuracy, precision, and trending abilities of four calibrated stroke volume estimates based on pulmonary artery pulse contour analysis. RESULTS Stroke volume was measured in 9 pigs with a pulmonary artery ultrasound flow probe at 5 and 10 cmH2O of PEEP and three volume states (baseline, bleeding, and retransfusion) and compared against stroke volume estimates of four calibrated pulmonary pulse contour algorithms based on pulse pressure or pressure integration. Bland-Altman comparison with correction for multiple measurements and trend analysis were performed. Heart rate and stroke volumes were 104 ± 24 bpm and 30 ± 12 mL, respectively. The stroke volume estimates had a minimal bias: - 0.11 mL (95% CI - 0.55 to 0.33) to 0.32 mL (95% CI - 0.06 to 0.70). The limits of agreement were - 8.0 to 7.8 mL for calibrated pulse pressure to - 10.4 to 11.5 mL for time corrected pressure integration, resulting in a percentage error of 36 to 37%. The calibrated pulse pressure method performed best. Changes in stroke volume were trended very well (concordance rates 73-100%, r2 0.26 to 0.987, for pulse pressure methods and 71-100%, r2 0.236 to 0.977, for integration methods). CONCLUSIONS Pulmonary artery pulse contour methods reliably detect acute changes in stroke volume with good accuracy and moderate precision and accurately trend short-term changes in cardiac output over time.","Berger, David; Hobi, Jan; Möller, Per W; Haenggi, Matthias; Takala, Jukka; Jakob, Stephan M",Intensive care medicine experimental,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40635-020-00347-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33026562/,472

Assessing this risk implies quantifying transmission from humans-to-cats, from cats-to-cats and from cats-to-humans. Here we quantified the risk of cat-to-cat transmission by reviewing published literature describing transmission either experimentally or under natural conditions in infected households. Data from these studies were collated to quantify the SARS-CoV-2 reproduction number R0 among cats. The estimated R0 was significantly higher than 1, hence cats could play a role in the transmission and maintenance of SARS-CoV-2. Questions that remain to be addressed are the risk of transmission from humans-to-cats and cats-to-humans. Further data on household transmission and data on virus levels in both the environment around infected cats and their exhaled air could be a step towards assessing these risks.","Gonzales, Jose L.; de Jong, Mart C.M.; Gerhards, Nora M.; Van der Poel, Wim H.

Among foodborne bacterial pathogens, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are of extraordinary significance which drive reasons of food and beverage poisoning in numerous cases. Today, PCR has been widely used to examine the presence of different foodborne pathogens. However, PCR requires specialized equipment and skillful personnel which limit its application in the field. Recently, there is an emerging of isothermal PCR methods in which the reactions occur at low and constant temperature, allowing their application in restricted-resource settings. In this work, multiplex Recombinase Polymerase Amplification (RPA) was used to simultaneously detect S. aureus and P. aeruginosa with high sensitivity and specificity. The limit detection of multiplex RPA was 10 and 30 fg/reaction of genomic DNAs of S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, respectively. Besides, the reaction time was reduced to only 25 minutes with a low incubation temperature of 39 °C. Markedly, multiplex RPA reactions succeeded to directly detect as low as 1 and 5 CFU/reaction of S. aureus and P. aeruginosa cells, respectively without the requirement of extracting DNA genome. Moreover, the multiplex RPA reliably detected the two foodborne bacteria in milk, fruit juice and bottled water samples. In general, the direct multiplex RPA described in this study is a rapid, simple, sensitive and efficient alternative tool that could be used to detect the presence of S. aureus and P. aeruginosa without the necessity of costly devices and high-trained staff.","Tran, Diem Hong; Tran, Hau Thi; Pham, Trang Nguyen Minh; Phung, Huong Thi Thu",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.29.458066,472

IgG products from plasma obtained from Germany, Czech Republic, Slovak Republic, USA and Spain were tested for antibodies to four common HCoV: 229E, OC43, NL63 and HKU1. Since these products are manufactured from pooled plasma from thousands of donors, the antibodies therein are a representation of the HCoV exposure of the population at large. Methods IgG products of different concentrations manufactured from geographically diverse plasma pools were tested for antibodies to four common HCoV by ELISA. In addition, neutralization assays were conducted using HCoV-229E expressed in MRC5 cells. Complete concentration-neutralization curves were obtained to calculate potencies. Results The ELISA assays showed that when expressed as specific activity (anti-HCoV activity/mg IgG) similar activity against the four common HCoV was seen across the IgG products regardless of concentration or geographic origin. Highest anti-HCoV activity was seen against HCoV-229E, followed by HCoV-OC43 and then HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1. The neutralization assays showed similar potency for two preparations of IgG prepared by different processes. Conclusions These studies are the first demonstration of antibodies to common HCoV in IgG products. The level of activity was similar regardless of the geographic origin of the plasma pool. These antibodies demonstrated neutralization activity against HCoV-229E in MRC5 cells. These results may explain the cross-reactivity seen with pre-pandemic IgG products and SARS-CoV-2 and contribute to the variability in disease course in different patients.","Díez, José María; Romero, Carolina; Gajardo, Rodrigo",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.23.453571,472

164050,A build-at-home student laboratory experiment in mechanical vibrations,2021,"The reproduction number is an indicator of the evolution of an epidemic.Consequently, accurate estimators for this number are essential for decision making in politics. Many estimators use filtered data as input to compensate for fluctuations of reported cases. However, for daily-based estimations, this filtering leads to delays. Some approaches use small window sizes for filtering to overcome this issue. This, in turn, leads to an increased periodic behavior of estimators. To overcome these issues, in the present paper, we introduce an estimator for the reproduction number that uses an acausally filtered number of cases as input, hence avoiding both the periodic behavior and the delay. For the filter size, we suggest using a multiple of one week since reported cases often exhibit a weekly pattern. We show that this approach is more robust against periodicities, and that it does not exhibit any delays in the estimation compared to estimators with smaller filter sizes. Moreover, often it is hard to examine estimators in detail because a ground truth is missing. For analyzing different properties of the estimators, we propose a method to generate synthetic datasets that can be taken as ground truths. Importantly, the synthetic data contains all relevant real-world behavior. Finally, we apply the proposed estimator to the publicly available COVID-19 data for Germany. We compare the proposed estimator to two estimators used by the federal German Robert Koch Institute (RKI). We observe that our estimator is more stable than the benchmarks especially if the reproduction number is close to 1. Based on the observation that the proposed estimator appears more robust, it may be a useful asset when considering governmental interventions.

Maize, sorghum and millet the major cereal grains used in poultry feed production have become more expensive and strategies need to be adopted to ameliorate this. Hence a review study was carried out to unravel the potentials of acha grains as a feedstuff which is in the class of maize in poultry feeds. Acha is a tiny cereal grain grown in Northern part of Nigeria which is not popular in poultry feeds. Its starch content (80%) is high, low crude fibre (1.0%), appreciable level of lysine (more than 1.0%) and methionine (0.40%) and higher metabolizable energy (3700 Kcal_ME/kg) compared to maize. Its nutrient digestibility is high in terms of starch, crude protein and crude fibre. Though acha contains anti-nutritional factors such as tannins, saponin and phytic acid, the levels of the anti-nutritional factors are comparable to maize and are tolerated by chickens. Both the polished and unpolished acha grains could be used in place of maize, sorghum and millet. With vast area of land in Northern part of Nigeria, production and supply of acha to feed millers could be sustained, which could lead to a reduction in the price of maize and improved profit maximization by farmers.","Ukim, C.

LMD activities with a large frequency of trips can increase logistics operational costs if operational handling is not carried out optimally. Optimization of LMD distribution routes is applied as an operational handling and also as a solution to the vehicle routing problem (VRP). VRP is an important problem to consider in transportation modeling where an optimum route plan is desired to obtain the minimum cost. The purpose of this paper is to optimize the last mile delivery route using the Heterogeneous Fleet Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Window (HFVRP-TW) model in urban areas. The route optimization process is carried out by developing and applying the HFVRP-TW model using data from one of the express delivery companies in Jakarta, Indonesia, and then simulating and forming several operational scenarios. The results of the analysis show that the application of route optimization with variations in vehicle types reduced operating costs by an average of 58.46% - 65.98% compared to the existing conditions. Scenario evaluation is carried out to obtain the scenario with the lowest operational cost. The evaluation results show that the best scenario is a scenario that has the closest characteristics to existing conditions, where there is no change in the type of vehicle used and optimization is only applied to operational routes.

165066,Evaluating Supply Chain Collaboration Barriers in Small- and Medium-Sized Enterprises,2021,"Background Phase is the most fundamental physical quantity when we study an oscillatory time series, and there are a lot of tools aiming to estimate phase. Most existing algorithms are developed based on the analytic function model. Unfortunately, this approach might not be suitable for several modern signals, particularly biomedical signals, due to the intrinsic complicated structure, including (possibly) multiple oscillatory components, each with time-varying frequency, amplitude, and non-sinusoidal oscillation. Due to the lack of consensus of model and algorithm, phases estimated from signals simultaneously recorded from different sensors for the same physiological system from the same subject might be different. All these might challenge reproducibility, communication, and scientific interpretation. Objectives We need a standardized tool with theoretical supports over a unified model to extract phase. Methods We systematically summarize existing models for phase and algorithms and discuss why we may face challenges with them. Then we introduce the adaptive non-harmonic model (ANHM) and how to define phase with this model and suggest applying algorithms that can separate oscillatory components and recover their fundamental components, e.g., the synchrosqueezing transformation (SST) or the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) with a proper time-varying bandpass filter, to extract the phase. Results Two databases with different physiological signals, one for respiration and one for hemodynamic, with different clinical applications are explored. We report that the extracted phases following the definition, if properly extracted, are more uniform across different recording modalities and are immune to non-sinusoidal oscillation compared with traditional approaches. Conclusions The proposed combination of ANHM and algorithms alleviates the above-mentioned challenges. We expect its scientific impact on a broad range of applications.","Huang, Yu-Chen; Alian, Aymen; Lo, Yu-Lun; Shelley, Kirk; Wu, Hau-Tieng",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.29.310417,472
165089,How did COVID-19 impact working professionals – a typology of impacts focused on education sector,2021,"Background: The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants is a current public health concern possibly impacting COVID-19 disease diagnosis, transmission patterns and vaccine effectiveness. Objectives: To describe the SARS-CoV-2 lineages circulating early pandemic among samples with S gene dropout and characterize a novel mutation in receptor-binding domain (RBD) of viral spike protein. Study design: Adults and children older than 2 months with signs and symptoms of COVID-19 were prospectively enrolled from May to October 2020 in Porto Alegre, Brazil. All participants performed RT-PCR assays for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2, samples with S gene dropout and Ct < 30 (cycle threshold) were submitted to whole genome sequencing (WGS), and homology modeling and physicochemical properties analysis were performed. Results: 484/1,557 participants tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. The S gene dropout was detected in 7.4% (36/484) as early as May, and a peak was observed in early August. WGS was performed in 8 samples. The B.1.1.28, B.1.91 and B.1.1.33 lineages were circulating in early pandemic. The RBD novel mutation (Y380Q) was found in one sample occurring simultaneously with C379W and V395A, and the B.1.91 lineage in the spike protein. Conclusion: Mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 spike region were detected early in the COVID-19 pandemic in Southern Brazil, regarding the B.1.1.28, B.1.91 and B.1.1.33 lineages identified. The novel mutation (Y380Q) with C379W, modifies important RBD properties, which may interfere with the binding of neutralizing antibodies (CR3022, EY6A, H014, S304).","Sartor, I. T. S.; Varela, F.

165181,Price Prediction with the Sectorial Effect on Stock Market Due to COVID-19,2022,"Highly pathogenic respiratory viruses such as 1918 influenza (HIN1) and coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) induce significant lung injury with diffuse alveolar damage, capillary leak, and extensive cell death resulting in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Direct effects of the virus, as well as host immune response such as proinflammatory cytokine production, contribute to programmed cell death or apoptosis. Alveolar lung epithelial type II (AT2) cells play a major role in the clearance of respiratory viruses, secretion of surfactant proteins and antimicrobial substances into the bronchoalveolar fluid as well as repair of lung injury. Gene expression in AT2 cells is regulated in a tissue and cell-specific manner and in a temporal fashion. The availability of tissue and cell-specific RNA datasets in Human Protein Atlas led to the identification of localized expression patterns of BCL-2 family members such as BCL2 related protein A1 (BCL2A1) in AT2 cells and immune cells of the lung. BCL2A1 expression was regulated by multiple stimuli including Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands, interferons (IFNs), inflammatory cytokines, and inhibited by the steroid dexamethasone. In this study, regulation of BCL2A1 gene expression in human lung epithelial cells by several respiratory viruses and type I interferon signaling was investigated. SARS-CoV-2 infection significantly induced BCL2A1 expression in human lung epithelial cells within 24 hours that required the expression of Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). BCL2A1 mRNA induction by SARS-CoV-2 was correlated with the induced expression of IFN-β and IFN-regulated transcription factor mRNA. BCL2A1 was induced by IFN-β treatment or by infection with influenza virus lacking the non-structural protein1(NS1) in NHBE cells. Furthermore, bioinformatics revealed that a subset of BCL-2 family members involved in the control of apoptosis and transcription such as BCL2A1, BCL2L14, BCL3, and BCL6 were regulated in the lung epithelial cells by coronaviruses and in the lung tissue samples of COVID-19 patients. Transcriptomic data also suggested that these genes were differentially regulated by the steroid drug dexamethasone.","Ramana, Chilakamarti V.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.21.453244,472
165224,The effect of erp on firm performance through information quality and supply chain integration in covid-19 era,2021,"We evaluate the outward and inward protections of different mask types (N95, surgical and two cloth mask designs) taking into account the imperfect fit on the wearer. To this end, we built a manikin to simulate exhaling, coughing and inhaling of aerosol droplets 0.3-5.0 um in diameters. The outward and inward protections depend on many factors, including the droplet size, the mask fit and the presence of a filter layer. Here, we show that cloth and surgical masks with a non-woven filter layer can achieve a combined outward and inward protections between 50% and 90%. Removing the filter layer greatly reduces the protection efficiency to below 20% for the smallest droplet size. While a well-fitted N95 masks offer protection efficiency close to 100%, a poorly fitted N95 mask with gaps offers less protection than a well-fitted surgical/cloth mask. We also found that double masking or the wearing of cloth mask on top of a surgical mask is only effective at reducing outward droplet emissions when coughing, while offering no additional protection when exhaling/inhaling as compared to a single cloth/surgical mask. The results of our work can inform the implementation of mask mandates to minimize airborne transmissions of coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19).","Koh, X.; Sng, A.; Chee, J.

And in 2020, although affected by the pandemic of COVID-19, great achievement has been made in both basic and clinical research in CAR-T cell therapy. As for basic research, a variety of new CAR-T related technologies was developed. For instance, CD3 epsilon cytoplasmic domain was incorporated into a second-generation chimeric antigen receptor (CAR), resulting increased antitumor activities and less cytokine release. Up to November 2nd, ten new INDs for CAR-T cell therapies were approved by National Medical Products Administration (NMPA). And, importantly, two New Drug Application of CAR-T cell programs were submitted to NMPA. Additionally, there are 397 clinical trials on CAR-T cell therapies in China. CAR-T cells redirected to new targets such as claudin18.2 and some next-generation of CAR-T cell programs are under clinical evaluation.

To solve this problem, this paper proposes a mask detection device based on yolo3 framework. The device uses the yolov3 algorithm to extract the face prediction area, and uses the gray image to calculate the skin exposure rate of the mouth and nose of the face, so as to judge whether the recognized person is wearing a mask or not and whether the mask is wearing correctly.

In order to understand which factors played a crucial role in reducing transport demand, an online questionnaire survey was conducted exploring one of the regions of Italy, i.e. Sicily, which was severely affected by the pandemic and was characterized by the greatest transport disruption among the other Italian regions. The survey was answered by 700 respondents who were frequent PT commuters before the outbreak of the pandemic. It collected sociodemographic information, highlighted the public transport demand figures before and after the lockdown period in Sicily and assessed the acceptance rates of the national recommendations which aimed to prevent contagion and encourage the use of PT. The survey data were analyzed using descriptive and cluster analysis techniques. During the examined periods, the results demonstrated three (3) clusters of PT commuters in Sicily and associated them with certain sociodemographic characteristics and acceptance rates of the national PT recommendations.

166205,Higher school teacher's competences and ⇜electronic⇝ pedagogical culture in the post-pandemic world,2021,"Background: By 2030, the global population of people older than 60 years is expected to be higher than the number of children under 10 years, resulting in major health and social care system implications worldwide. Without a supportive environment, whether social or built, diminished functional ability may arise in older people. Functional ability comprises an individual's intrinsic capacity and people's interaction with their environment enabling them to be and do what they value. Objectives: This evidence and gap map aims to identify primary studies and systematic reviews of health and social support services as well as assistive devices designed to support functional ability among older adults living at home or in other places of residence. Search Methods: We systematically searched from inception to August 2018 in: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, CENTRAL, CINAHL, PsycINFO, AgeLine, Campbell Library, ASSIA, Social Science Citation Index and Social Policy & Practice. We conducted a focused search for grey literature and protocols of studies (e.g., ProQuest Theses and Dissertation Global, conference abstract databases, Help Age, PROSPERO, Cochrane and Campbell libraries and ClinicalTrials.gov). Selection Criteria: Screening and data extraction were performed independently in duplicate according to our intervention and outcome framework. We included completed and on-going systematic reviews and randomized controlled trials of effectiveness on health and social support services provided at home, assistive products and technology for personal indoor and outdoor mobility and transportation as well as design, construction and building products and technology of buildings for private use such as wheelchairs, and ramps. Data Collection and Analysis: We coded interventions and outcomes, and the number of studies that assessed health inequities across equity factors. We mapped outcomes based on the International Classification of Function, Disability and Health (ICF) adapted categories: intrinsic capacities (body function and structures) and functional abilities (activities). We assessed methodological quality of systematic reviews using the AMSTAR II checklist. Main Results: After de-duplication, 10,783 records were screened. The map includes 548 studies (120 systematic reviews and 428 randomized controlled trials). Interventions and outcomes were classified using domains from the International Classification of Function, Disability and Health (ICF) framework. Most systematic reviews (n = 71, 59%) were rated low or critically low for methodological quality. The most common interventions were home-based rehabilitation for older adults (n = 276) and home-based health services for disease prevention (n = 233), mostly delivered by visiting healthcare professionals (n = 474). There was a relative paucity of studies on personal mobility, building adaptations, family support, personal support and befriending or friendly visits. The most measured intrinsic capacity domains were mental function (n = 269) and neuromusculoskeletal function (n = 164). The most measured outcomes for functional ability were basic needs (n = 277) and mobility (n = 160). There were few studies which evaluated outcome domains of social participation, financial security, ability to maintain relationships and communication. There was a lack of studies in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and a gap in the assessment of health equity issues. Authors' Conclusions: There is substantial evidence for interventions to promote functional ability in older adults at home including mostly home-based rehabilitation for older adults and home-based health services for disease prevention. Remotely delivered home-based services are of greater importance to policy-makers and practitioners in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. This map of studies published prior to the pandemic provides an initial resource to identify relevant homebased services which may be of interest for policy-makers and practitioners, such as home-based rehabilitation and social support, although these interventions would likely require further adaptation for online delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic. There is a need to strengthen assessment of social support and mobility interventions and outcomes related to making decisions, building relationships, financial security, and communication in future studies. More studies are needed to assess LMIC contexts and health equity issues.","Welch, Vivian Mathew Christine M.; Babelmorad, Panteha Yanfei Li Ghogomu Elizabeth T.; Borg, Johan Conde Monserrat Kristjansson Elizabeth Lyddiatt Anne Marcus Sue Nickerson Jason W.; Pottie, Kevin Rogers Morwenna Sadana Ritu Saran Ashrita Shea Beverly Sheehy Lisa Sveistrup Heidi Tanuseputro Peter Thompson-Coon Joanna",Campbell Systematic Reviews,https://doi.org/10.1002/cl2.1175,472

166271,Assessment of variations of air pollutant concentrations during the COVID-19 lockdown and impact on urban air quality in South Asia,2021,"Glycerol is an eco-friendly solvent enhancing plant-biomass decomposition through a glycerolysis process in many pretreatment methods. Nonetheless, the lack of efficient conversion of glycerol by natural Saccharomyces cerevisiae restrains many of these scenarios. Here we outline the complete strategy for the generation of efficient glycerol fermenting yeast by rewriting the oxidation of cytosolic nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) by O2-dependent dynamic shuttle while abolishing both glycerol phosphorylation and biosynthesis pathways. By following a vigorous glycerol oxidative pathway, the engineered strain demonstrated augmentation in conversion efficiency (CE) reach up to 0.49g-ethanol/g-glycerol—98% of theoretical conversion—with production rate >1 g/L-1h-1 when supplementing glycerol as a single fed-batch on a rich-medium. Furthermore, the engineered strain showed a new capability toward ferment a mixture of glycerol and glucose with producing >86 g/L of bioethanol with 92.8% of the CE. To our knowledge, this is the highest ever reported titer in this regard. Notably, this strategy flipped our ancestral yeast from non-growth on glycerol, on the minimal medium, to a fermenting strain with productivities 0.25-0.5 g/L-1h-1 and 84-78% of CE, respectively and 90% of total conversions to the products. The findings in metabolic engineering here may release the limitations of utilizing glycerol in several eco-friendly biorefinery approaches. IMPORTANCE With the avenues for achieving efficient lignocellulosic biorefinery scenarios, glycerol gained keen attention as an eco-friendly biomass-derived solvent for enhancing the dissociation of lignin and cell wall polysaccharides during pretreatment process. Co-fermentation of glycerol with the released sugars from biomass after the glycerolysis expands the resource for ethanol production and release from the burden of component separation. Titer productivities are one of the main obstacles for industrial applications of this process. Therefore, the generation of highly efficient glycerol fermenting yeast significantly promotes the applicability of the integrated biorefineries scenario. Besides, the glycerol is an important carbon resource for producing chemicals. Hence, the metabolic flux control of yeast from glycerol contributes to generation of cell factory producing chemicals from glycerol, promoting the association between biodiesel and bioethanol industries. Thus, this study will shed light on solving the problems of global warming and agricultural wastes, leading to establishment of the sustainable society.","Khattab, Sadat M.

166273,Experimental study of indoor air quality for cooling condition using arduino system and pmv index testing the effect of heat sources,2021,"Background: The severe measures of lockdown imposed in Italy to limit the SARS coronavirus 2 disease (COVID-19) spread caused an increase of reported anxiety, depression and suicidal rate among general population. Patients affected by rheumatic disorders feature an increased risk of mood disorders for the chronic course of the disease itself and for the related disability. Objectives: Aim of this study was to investigate the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on emotional well-being of a large cohort of rheumatic patients through a telemedicine approach. Methods: Patients in follow-up in rheumatologic out-patient clinics of our hospital were invited to participate to an online survey. They were asked also to invite their best friend, matched for age and sex, to participate the survey, as control group. The online survey included demographic questions and validated, psychometric scales for stress vulnerability (Stress Vulnerability Scale-SVS), resilience (Resilience Scale-RS), depression (Zung's depression questionnaire-Zung-D) and anxiety (Zung's anxiety questionnaire-Zung-A) evaluation. Results: The cohort was composed by 484 subjects (84,1% F, 15,9% M). The number of subjects and the frequency of various diagnosis are shown in Table 1. According to the psychometric scales, 55,5% and 43,3% of subject showed respectively an increased stress vulnerability and a reduced resiliency. Moreover, 64% and 40,5% of the enrolled subjects reported respectively anxiety and depressive symptoms worthy of psychiatric attention. There was a significant different distribution of scores for SVS (p<0,0001), Zung-A (p<0,0001) and Zung-D (p<0,0001) among the various diagnosis. In comparison with controls, higher scores of SVS were present in connective tissue diseases (CTD) (p=0,007), Sjogren's Syndrome (SSJ) (p=0,0029) and fibromyalgia (FM) (p<0,0001) patients, higher scores of Zung-A were present in SSJ (p=0,006) and FM (p<0,0001) patients and higher scores of Zung-D were present in FM (p<0,0001) patients (Figure 1). Ordinal regression analysis showed that higher classes of anxiety were independently predicted by the Tension (β=0,32;CI=0,13-0,52;p=0,003) and Demoralization (β=0,22;CI=0,04-0,44;p=0,046) components of SVS and by the Zung-D score (β=0,09;CI=0,05-0,1;p<0,001), while higher classes of depression were independently predicted by SVS total (β=0,17;CI=0,03-0,30;p=0,012), by its subcomponent Demoralization (β=0,22;CI=0,01-0,43;p=0,038), by a lower absolute RS score (β=-0,083;CI=-0,1-0,06;p<0,001) and by the Zung-A score (β=0,11;CI=0,06-0,15;p<0,001). In both cases, a specific diagnosis was not associated to a higher risk of advanced anxiety and depression classes. Conclusion: Rheumatic patients developed a high frequency of anxiety and depressive symptoms following COVID-19 lockdown, of which a large part should be referred for specialist attention according to their severity. There was a large variability of the symptoms reported among the various diagnosis. CTD, SSJ and FM patients were the most susceptible to the development of anxiety, depression and stress vulnerability. The application of psycometric scales through a telemedicine approach represents a useful tool to identify patients with higher levels of anxiety and depression.","Iannuccelli, C.; Lucchino, B.; Gioia, C.; Gattamelata, A.; Giardina, F.; Di Franco, M.; Priori, R.; Conti, F.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2021-eular.3488,472
166323,Ensuring Equitable and Accessible Technology: A View From the CEC Division of Innovations in Special Education Technology (ISET),2021,"We observed the interference between two prevalent respiratory viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza A virus (IAV, H1N1), and characterized its molecular underpinnings in alveolar epithelial cells (A549). We found that RSV induces higher interferon (IFN) β production than IAV and that IFNβ priming confers higher protection against infection with IAV than with RSV. Consequently, we focused on the sequential infection scheme: RSV-then-IAV. Using the A549 WT, IFNAR1 KO, IFNLR1 KO, and IFNAR1–IFNLR1 double KO cell lines we found that both IFNβ and IFNλ are necessary for maximum protection against subsequent infection. Immunostaining revealed that preinfection with RSV partitions the cell population into a subpopulation susceptible to subsequent infection with IAV and an IAV-proof subpopulation. Strikingly, the susceptible cells turned out to be those already compromised and efficiently expressing RSV, whereas the bystander, interferon-primed cells are resistant to IAV infection. Thus, the virus–virus exclusion at the cell population level is not realized through a direct competition for a shared ecological niche (single cell) but rather achieved with the involvement of specific cytokines induced within the host innate immune response. Author summary After being challenged with a pathogen, infected cells warn bystander cells about the potential threat by synthesizing and secreting cytokines, especially interferons. In this way, the not yet infected but warned cells are given an opportunity to reinforce their defense mechanisms before they encounter the pathogen replicating in the infected cells whose defense mechanisms have been overcome. Consequently, cell population is partitioned into the cells that may be more prone to infection with another pathogen and the cells that may be expected to be resistant to another pathogen. By studying at the single-cell level the sequential infection with two prevalent respiratory viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza A virus (IAV), we showed that the interferon-mediated resistance induced by infection with RSV protects non-infected cells from infection with IAV. The cells compromised by RSV turned out however to be susceptible to invasion of IAV. This demonstrates that, even in the absence of within-cell viral competition, the innate immune response can induct viral interference between primary infection with RSV and secondary infection with IAV.","Czerkies, Maciej; Kochańczyk, Marek; Korwek, Zbigniew; Prus, Wiktor; Lipniacki, Tomasz",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.10.11.463877,472

Although specific parameters, including age, gender, chronic diseases, D-dimer, and neutrophil-lymphocyte-ratio play a curial role in COVID-19, the association between mortality and the extent of lung involvement in the initial computerized tomography (CT) scan of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 has not been well documented in the literature. Objectives: We compared two groups (CT-1 and CT-2) in terms of lung involvement in the initial CT of patients admitted to the emergency unit and then hospitallzed with COVID-19. Methods: Using the digital data system of Ízmir Bozyaka Training and Research Hospital, Turkey, subjects diagnosed with COVID-19 in April 2020 were retrospectively screened. For each of the 90 patients, the initial CT scans on admission were evaluated for the extent of lung involvement and classified as CT-1 (≤ 5% of lung involvement, n: 45) and CT-2 (> 5% of lung involvement, n: 45). Results: There was not any statistical significance between two different CT groups regarding mortality and length of stay of patients in hospital with COVID-19 (P = 0.72 and P = 0.51, respectively).

167107,The power of stories for impression management: evidence from a city cultural digital storytelling initiative,2021,"The 2020 pandemic has transformed the world and elicited thousands of studies to better understand the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Viral load has been a common measure to monitor treatment therapies and associate viral dynamics with patient outcomes; however, methods associated with viral load have varied across studies. These variations have the potential to sacrifice the accuracy of findings as they often do not account for inter-assay variation or variation across samples. In a retrospective study of nasopharyngeal samples, we found a significant amount of variation within the DNA and RNA targets; for example, across time within a single patient, there was an average of a 32-fold change. Further, we explore the impacts of host normalization on 94 clinical samples using the TGen Quantitative SARS-CoV-2 assay, finding that without host normalization samples with the same viral concentration can have up to 100-fold variation in the viral load.","Porter, W.

To understand these relationships, the study performed PLS-SEM on the data collected using purposive sampling from 103 respondents consisting of small business owners and the business managers of budget hotels from urban areas of India. Results show that the PsyCap of owners/managers of small hotels can instil hope and optimism in the employees too and can help them to accept the reality and prepare for future contingencies. It also highlights the impact of owner’s life satisfaction on PsyCap and organizational resilience relationship stating that the levels of life satisfaction of owners and managers of budget hotels significantly influence the process of recovery of the business. This means that despite of adversities, resilient owners and managers would make efforts to get over the negativities of COVID-19 and try to get back to normal. From a practical perspective in the present scenario where tourism sector is struggling for survival, the findings of the study will help the owners and managers of budget hotels to navigate through the stages of COVID-19 pandemic for speedy recovery.","Pathak, Deepti Joshi Gaurav",Current Issues in Tourism,https://doi.org/10.1080/13683500.2020.1844643,472

To this end, we partner with one of the main cellular network providers in Brazil, TIM Brazil, and collect and analyze cellular network connections from 973 antennas for all users in the city of Rio de Janeiro and its suburbs. We develop a Markovian model that captures the mobility of individuals across municipalities of the city. The transition probabilities of the Markov chain are determined by analyzing user-level mobility events between antennas from the cellular network connectivity logs. We combine the aggregate mobility characteristics across municipalities as evidenced from the transition probabilities with the number of reported COVID-19 cases in a municipality during a particular week to design mobility-aware COVID-19 case prediction models that predict the number of cases for the following week. Our experiments demonstrate that our mobility-aware models significantly outperform a baseline mobility-agnostic linear regression model in terms of metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). © 2021 IFIP.","Ayan, N.; Chaskar, S.; Seetharam, A.; Ramesh, A.; Rocha, A.

The routine activities of the dengue management system have been significantly curtailed as government authorities concentrate more on containing the transmission of the COVID-19. This study aimed to describe vector control Aedes sp. during pandemic COVID-19, such as community activities in controlling breeding places, area risk, vector density and the determinant factors. This study was a community-based cross-sectional survey involving 136 households in the endemic area of Gondokusuman District, Yogyakarta, Indonesia using proportionate stratified random sampling. Data analysis was performed through simple and multiple logistic regression tests. Vector control for Aedes sp. breeding places during pandemic COVID-19 in the community are still low;the high level of vector density proves this based on House Index (HI): 44.1%, container index (CI): 57.4%, and Breteau Index (BI): 213.2%. This district is also at high risk to be the breeding places of Aedes sp. based on maya index (MI): 64.7%.

167785,Rethinking interaction in social distancing times: implications for business-to-business companies,2021,"In the pathogenesis of COVID-19, impairment of respiratory functions is often one of the key symptoms. Studies show that in these cases, voice production is also adversely affected -- vocal fold oscillations are asynchronous, asymmetrical and more restricted during phonation. This paper proposes a method that analyzes the differential dynamics of the glottal flow waveform (GFW) during voice production to identify features in them that are most significant for the detection of COVID-19 from voice. Since it is hard to measure this directly in COVID-19 patients, we infer it from recorded speech signals and compare it to the GFW computed from physical model of phonation. For normal voices, the difference between the two should be minimal, since physical models are constructed to explain phonation under assumptions of normalcy. Greater differences implicate anomalies in the bio-physical factors that contribute to the correctness of the physical model, revealing their significance indirectly. Our proposed method uses a CNN-based 2-step attention model that locates anomalies in time-feature space in the difference of the two GFWs, allowing us to infer their potential as discriminative features for classification. The viability of this method is demonstrated using a clinically curated dataset of COVID-19 positive and negative subjects.","Deshmukh, Soham; Ismail, Mahmoud Al; Singh, Rita",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.16318v1.pdf,472

Due to the current COVID-19 pandemic, FFR supplies are dwindling in many health systems, necessitating re-use of potentially contaminated FFR. Multiple decontamination solutions have been developed to meet this pressing need, including systems designed for bulk decontamination of FFR using vaprous hydrogen peroxide or UV-C radiation. However, the large scale on which these devices operate may not be logistically practical for small or rural health care settings or for ad hoc use at points-of-care. Here, we present the Synchronous UV Decontamination System (SUDS), a novel device for rapidly deployable, point-of-care decontamination using UV-C germicidal irradiation. We designed a compact, easy-to-use device capable of delivering over 2 J/cm^2 of UV-C radiation in one minute. This short decontamination time should enable care-providers to incorporate decontamination of FFR into a normal donning and doffing routine following patient encounters.","Kayani, B. J.; Weaver, D.

Whereas previously the aim was to override given barriers, now, in the case of a pandemic, the main idea is to create an intentional distance between patients and healthcare professionals in order to avoid cross-infection. To meet the needs of a fully diagnostic examination, a robotic based system was designed. However, collaborative robotic systems bear new risks, that have to be dealt with. To prepare future physicians for telediagnostics, we developed a training curriculum for the telemedical examinations.

168215,Economic Policy Uncertainty and Local Carbon Emission Trading: A Multifractal Analysis from US and Guangdong,2021,"With the global COVID-19 pandemic, many public health services were severely disrupted. Estimating the overall health effects of this is difficult as most disease surveillance systems have also been substantially affected during the pandemic. For some diseases, this effect is mitigated by the methods enacted to fight the pandemic, such as use of facial coverings, social distancing and quarantine, but measles is infectious to the degree that this mitigation is likely to be limited. Thus, outbreaks and an increase in global measles mortality are expected. However, the severity of this impact is not yet known. In early 2020, a study by Roberton and colleagues predicted an additional 12,360 to 37,920 deaths in children under-five worldwide from measles over the coming year based on three potential levels of vaccine coverage reductions ranging from 18.5 to 51.9%. Our study investigates the magnitude of the increase in measles mortality due to decreased vaccine coverage because of COVID-19, based on official estimates of 2020 measles vaccine coverage from WHO/UNICEF released in July 2021. Using the Lives Saved Tool (LiST), an interventions modeling program, we estimated measles mortality for low/middle income countries (LMICs) based on the 2020 WHO/UNICEF estimates of national immunization coverage (WUENIC). Because these calculations use actual reported vaccine coverage, they provide a more accurate picture of measles mortality related to COVID-19 disruptions in 2020. Using the WUENIC data, LiST predicted fewer additional deaths in 2020 due to decreases in measles vaccine coverage than estimations made by LiST based on Roberton, 2020 due to remarkable recovery efforts by national immunization programmes in the second half of 2020.","Gregory, L.

168679,Chaos amid chaos: A critical debate for street vendors – struggle and adaptation post covid era,2021,"One major micronutrient studied for its possible protective effect against the COVID-19 disease is vitamin D. This systematic review sought to identify and synthesize available evidence to aid the understanding of the possible effect of vitamin D deficiency on COVID-19 status and health outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Three databases (PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar) were systematically used to obtain English language journal articles published between 1 December 2019 and 3 November 2020. The search consisted of the terms (“Vitamin D,” OR “25-Hydroxyvitamin D,” OR “Low vitamin D.”) AND (“COVID-19” OR “2019-nCoV” OR “Coronavirus” OR “SARS-CoV-2”) AND (“disease severity” OR “IMV” OR “ICU admission” OR “mortality” OR “hospitalization” OR “infection”). We followed the recommended PRISMA guidelines in executing this study. After going through the screening of the articles, eleven articles were included in the review. All the included studies reported a positive association between vitamin D sufficiency and improved COVID-19 disease outcomes. On the other hand, vitamin D deficiency was associated with poor COVID-19 disease outcomes. Specifically, two studies found that vitamin D-deficient patients were more likely to die from COVID-19 compared to vitamin D-sufficient patients. Three studies showed that vitamin D-deficient people were more likely to develop severe COVID-19 disease compared to vitamin D-sufficient people. Furthermore, six studies found that vitamin D-deficient people were more likely to be COVID-19 infected compared to vitamin D-sufficient people. Findings from these studies suggest that vitamin D may serve as a mitigating effect for COVID-19 infection, severity, and mortality. The current evidence supports the recommendations for people to eat foods rich in vitamin D such as fish, red meat, liver, and egg yolks. The evidence also supports the provision of vitamin D supplements to individuals with COVID-19 disease and those at risk of COVID-19 infection in order to boost their immunity and improve health outcomes.","Das, Pranta Samad Nandeeta Ahinkorah Bright Opoku Hagan John Elvis Peprah Prince Mohammed Aliu Seidu Abdul-Aziz",COVID,https://doi.org/10.3390/covid1010008,472

To address these challenges, many parents rely on numerous parental control solutions on different platforms, including parental control network devices (e.g., WiFi routers) and software applications on mobile devices and laptops. While these parental control solutions may help digital parenting, they may also introduce serious security and privacy risks to children and parents, due to their elevated privileges and having access to a significant amount of privacy-sensitive data. In this paper, we present an experimental framework for systematically evaluating security and privacy issues in parental control software and hardware solutions. Using the developed framework, we provide the first comprehensive study of parental control tools on multiple platforms including network devices, Windows applications, Chrome extensions and Android apps. Our analysis uncovers pervasive security and privacy issues that can lead to leakage of private information, and/or allow an adversary to fully control the parental control solution, and thereby may directly aid cyberbullying and cyber predators.","Ali, S.; Elgharabawy, M.; Duchaussoy, Q.; Mannan, M.; Youssef, A.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.06502v1.pdf,472

Material and methods This was a web-based study, in which the frequency and type of virtual social media used by students as a source of information about COVID-19 were evaluated by the available sampling method. The statistical population of the study consisted of 500 students of medical universities in Iran. In the first step, administrators of student groups across the country were identified and contacted and asked to assist the research team by placing a link to complete the questionnaire, after which students voluntarily completed the online questionnaire in a self-reporting manner. Results The mean age of participants was 31.29 ±10.8 years. The selection percentages based on the number of selections were: WhatsApp (35.2), Instagram (32.7), Telegram (21.2), Facebook (8.3) and other networks (2.6). Regarding the relationship between the educational level (p < 0.001) and the field of study (p < 0.01), a statistically significant difference was found for the question of which media information is more acceptable in relation to obtaining information related to COVID-19. Conclusions It was found that social media will enable these media to act as a powerful tool to change the behavior of people and promote the well-being of individuals and public health. Social media is very important in combating this contagious disease, not only to obtain information and update on it, but also to understand how it spreads, how people function and how to respond to it.","Afshari, Poorandokht Beheshtinasab Maryam Cheraghi Maria",Neuropsychiatria i Neuropsychologia,https://doi.org/10.5114/nan.2021.108029,472

COVID-19-related fear, concern, worry, anxiety, and stress in combination with job-related MeSH terms were used to search the databases. The methodological quality of included papers was assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale checklist. To synthesize data, a qualitative synthesis of findings was performed due to the small number of included studies (n = 4) and the heterogeneity of the assessed outcomes. Four studies were included in the final analysis. All four studies were cross-sectional, collected the data online, and comprised 1654 participants from four different countries. Fear of COVID-19 was associated with increased future career anxiety, perceived job insecurity, organizational and professional turnover intentions, and decreased job satisfaction. COVID-19 Anxiety Syndrome was associated with scores on the Work and Social Adjustment Scale. As so few studies have been conducted, there are no conclusive findings.

170722,Cultural Dynamism and Business Vitality in Medium-Sized Cities—Evidence and Proposals for Sustainable Development,2021,"When it comes to debating the background of this article, the matter of preaching to people in a post-pandemic postmodernist world is standing central. One should always acknowledge that listeners do not listen with their ears only. In their quest of listening to sermons, people are looking for meaningfulness. In the act of listening, listeners’ senses are optimally utilised because, in the active listening process, they start to listen along with seeing and feeling, as they are being introduced to the feelings or emotions that emanate from a particular message. It is the authors’ objective to pay attention to listeners that are seeking to embrace the truth. Therefore, the sacramental essence of transform people’s lives, and for them to look in the right direction for answers in their search, and that cannot be underestimated. This article delineates the idea that preaching the gospel amounts to more than a mere stirring up of emotions. In fact, in a post-pandemic postmodernist world where listeners yearn for answers amid afflictions, profound preaching requires a renewed interest in the feelings emanating from the text itself. Our research question phrases the matter as follows: Does preaching to post-pandemic postmodernist people centre on an emotional tone of speaking, or does it, instead, centre on the feelings evoked by the text itself? This question is addressed by adhering to Dingemans’ visualisation of a research project that reckons with descriptive, normative and strategic perspectives. We, as the authors, aim to indicate the result of this investigation in the following manner: Although emotional manipulation may be a pitfall, one cannot ignore that persuasive preaching is intentional and aims to move listeners to find delight in the emotional appeal made by the passage in the gospel. Viewed from a Reformational viewpoint, this research could better illuminate the challenges preachers face in communicating to listeners in a postmodern post-pandemic world. Contribution: This article contributes by offering homiletical perspectives to two waves that have an interplay, namely postmodernism and reality within a post-pandemic world. Preaching the gospel that deals with the feelings in the text could provide an impetus to this kind of praxis.","Kruger, Ferdi P.; de Klerk, Ben J.",In die Skriflig,https://doi.org/10.4102/ids.v55i1.2737,472

As we look to the future, a consensus is emerging around the need to reject the highly individualistic focus of previous decades and to build back fairer by tackling the 'causes of the causes' of so many of our social ills. What might this mean for 'child protection', where a focus on individual families and individually generated risks has dominated? We suggest that this model is broken beyond repair and out of kilter with what is needed going forward. We argue that a focus on promoting human flourishing is likely to serve children, young people, their families and society better. In order to support such a project, we argue for the need to change our language, hold broader conversations than hitherto and marry ambition with caution.","Featherstone, B.; Gupta, A.; Morris, K.",Critical and Radical Social Work,https://doi.org/10.1332/204986021x16177977296051,472

We devised twenty-nine sets of search queries comprised of five queries per set to search against the five MEDLINE database platforms. We ran our queries monthly for a year and collected search result count data to observe changes. We found that search results vary considerably depending on MEDLINE platform, both within sets and across time. The variation is due to trends in scholarly publication that include publishing online first versus publishing in journal issues, which leads to metadata differences in the bibliographic record; to differences in the level of specificity among search fields provided by the platforms; to database integrity issues that lead to large fluctuations in monthly search results based on the same query; and to database currency issues that arise due to when each platform updates its MEDLINE file. Specific bibliographic databases, like PubMed and MEDLINE, are used to inform clinical decision-making, create systematic reviews, and construct knowledge bases for clinical decision support systems. Since they serve as essential information retrieval and discovery tools that help identify and collect research data and are used in a broad range of fields and as the basis of multiple research designs, this study should help clinicians, researcher, librarians, informationalists, and others understand how these platforms differ and inform future work in their standardization.","Burns, C.

The molecular events that orchestrated this sudden emergence of the killer fungus remain mostly elusive. Here, we identify centromeres in C. auris and related species, using a combined approach of chromatin immunoprecipitation and comparative genomic analyses. We find that C. auris and multiple other species in the Clavispora/Candida clade shared a conserved small regional centromere landscape lacking pericentromeres. Further, a centromere inactivation event led to karyotypic alterations in this species complex. Inter-species genome analysis identified several structural chromosomal changes around centromeres. In addition, centromeres are found to be rapidly evolving loci among the different geographical clades of the same species of C. auris. Finally, we reveal an evolutionary trajectory of the unique karyotype associated with clade 2 that consists of the drug susceptible isolates of C. auris.","Narayanan, Aswathy; Vadnala, Rakesh Netha; Ganguly, Promit; Selvakumar, Pavitra; Rudramurthy, Shivaprakash M; Prasad, Rajendra; Chakrabarti, Arunaloke; Siddharthan, Rahul; Sanyal, Kaustuv",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.29.428909,472

A 'functional-spatial' approach is proposed, in which the boundaries of spaces in the most active functional areas of the maternity hospital are changed: entrance area, reception of women in labour, area for relatives and visitors of the hospital, delivery of newborns, consultations in the polyclinic department of the maternity hospital. As a planning technique for distancing is proposed the formation of a system of space 'soft borders' using flexible, inclined, semi-cylindrical and 'flowing' translucent partitions. The second, 'environmental approach', is based on changing the scheme of communication and environmental situations in the internal environment of the maternity hospital due to the thoughtful arrangement of furniture and interior equipment, as well as due to light, colour and graphic navigation. Such a reorganization of the architectural and spatial structure of the maternity hospitals, based on the requirements of social distancing, preserves the value characteristics of the therapeutic environment. © 2021 Alexandra Chashchina et al., published by Sciendo 2021.","Chashchina, A.; Ulme, A.; Skopintsev, A.",Architecture and Urban Planning,https://doi.org/10.2478/aup-2021-0007,472

AmpSeq data for infectious microbes can inform disease control in multiple ways, including measuring drug resistance marker prevalence, distinguishing imported from local cases, and determining the effectiveness of therapeutics. We describe the design and comparative evaluation of two new AmpSeq assays for Plasmodium falciparum malaria parasites: a four-locus panel ('4CAST') composed of highly diverse antigens, and a 129-locus panel ('AMPLseq') composed of drug resistance markers, highly diverse loci for measuring relatedness, and a locus to detect Plasmodium vivax co-infections. We explore the performance of each panel in various public health use cases with in silico simulations as well as empirical experiments. We find that the smaller 4CAST panel performs reliably across a wide range of parasitemia levels without DNA pre-amplification, and could be highly informative for evaluating the number of distinct parasite strains within samples (complexity of infection) and distinguishing recrudescent infections from new infections in therapeutic efficacy studies. The AMPLseq panel performs similarly to two existing panels of comparable size for relatedness measurement, despite differences in the data and approach used for designing each panel. Finally, we describe an R package (paneljudge) that facilitates design and comparative evaluation of AmpSeq panels for relatedness estimation, and we provide general guidance on the design and implementation of AmpSeq panels for genomic epidemiology of infectious disease.","LaVerriere, E.; Schwabl, P.; Carrasquilla, M.; Taylor, A.

This paper reports a study investigating challenges and opportunities for initiation of discrete event simulation, as a tool for decision making in the era of industry 4.0 manufacturing. The research has been approached through action research in combination with a real case study at a manufacturing company in the energy sector. The Covid-19 pandemic fated that adjusted and new ways of communication, collaboration, and data collection, in relation to the methods, had to be explored and tried. Throughout the study, production data, such as processing times, have been collected and analyzed for discrete event simulation modelling. The complexity of introducing discrete event simulation as a new tool for decision making is highlighted, where we emphasize the human knowledge and involvement yet necessary to understand and to draw conclusions from the data. The results also demonstrate that the data analysis has given valuable insights into production characteristics, that need addressing.

The case of argentine beekeeping production entities,2021,"The current sanitary crisis due to COVID-19 has further evidenced the enormous digital exclusion of older adults. Furthermore, the crisis has urged older adults to adopt new technologies to facilitate their tasks, as well as to provide them with an effective means against loneliness and social isolation caused by the confinement. In light of this, Digital Literacy is necessary for all those excluded from the digital era, who are characterized mainly by little or no ability to effectively use technologies. Nevertheless, detailed studies showing the leap from mixed (Blended Learning, BL) to digital literacy in the elderly have not been published. The objective of the present research was to analyze the level of Digital Literacy with the Digital Literacy Evaluation (DILE) of two groups of elderly adults with different levels of literacy (Group 1: G1, and Group 2: G2) during three stages: BL (Aug-Dec 2019);Transition (Feb-Jun 2020);and Digital (Aug-Dec 2020). Comparisons were made before each educational level (pre-pre-pre) and after each educational level (post-post-post) and during consecutive periods before and after each semester (pre vs post) and throughout different educational levels (G1: Basic 1, B1;Basic 2, B2;and intermediate 1, I1;and G2: Intermediate 1 to 3, I1, I2, and I3). Subsequently, considering all the elderly who had passed at least one of the literacy levels, we worked with a total sample of 176 older adults. The comparisons showed that, before the pandemic, G1's pre digital literacy levels increased between B1 and B2 and that the differences continued with that increasing trend between the B1 level and the I1 completely digital treatment, and the same was observed for post measurements. On the other hand, for the G2, the differences in the DILE were statistically significant between the pre-condition of I2 (before the pandemic) and the I3 (completely digital treatment);and between the pre-conditions of I1 and I3;the same results were obtained for post treatments. Also, pre vs post scores on the DILE were statistically significant and older adults increased progressively their digital literacy despite the COVID-19 pandemic and jumped to the digital age.","Martinez-Alcala, C.

The recent situation heavily impacted on the financial and banking system and transformed the way it has functioned before. Moreover, it demonstrated that the banking system is more vulnerable than it should be. The banking sector has shown little capacity to absorb unexpected risks, owing to far-reaching international financial reforms. There are indications that some banks are on the verge of collapse, while some non-bank financial institutions and markets need immediate support. A decade after the financial crisis, the world is still struggling with the problems posed by the events of 2007–2009. Moreover, decisions taken during the crisis increased the risk that pandemic financial stress would develop into a banking crisis over time.

173611,Green(er) Cities and Their Citizens: Insights from the Participatory Budget of Lisbon,2021,"Background The programme to vaccinate adults in England has been rapidly implemented since it began in December 2020. The community prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike protein antibodies provides an estimate of total cumulative response to natural infection and vaccination. We describe the distribution of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in adults in England in May 2021 at a time when approximately 7 in 10 adults had received at least one dose of vaccine. Methods Sixth round of REACT-2 (REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission-2), a cross-sectional random community survey of adults in England, from 12 to 25 May 2021; 207,337 participants completed questionnaires and self-administered a lateral flow immunoassay test producing a positive or negative result. Results Vaccine coverage with one or more doses, weighted to the adult population in England, was 72.9% (95% confidence interval 72.7-73.0), varying by age from 25.1% (24.5-25.6) of those aged 18 to 24 years, to 99.2% (99.1-99.3) of those 75 years and older. In adjusted models, odds of vaccination were lower in men (odds ratio [OR] 0.89 [0.85-0.94]) than women, and in people of Black (0.41 [0.34-0.49]) compared to white ethnicity. There was higher vaccine coverage in the least deprived and highest income households. People who reported a history of COVID-19 were less likely to be vaccinated (OR 0.61 [0.55-0.67]). There was high coverage among health workers (OR 9.84 [8.79-11.02] and care workers (OR 4.17 [3.20-5.43]) compared to non-key workers, but lower in hospitality and retail workers (OR 0.73 [0.64-0.82] and 0.77 [0.70-0.85] respectively) after adjusting for age and key covariates. The prevalence of antibodies (weighted to the adult population of England and adjusted for test characteristics) was 61.1% (95% CI 60.9-61.4), up from 6.6% (5.4-5.7) in round 4 (27 October to 10 November 2020) and 13.9% (13.7-14.1) in round 5 (26 January to 8 February 2021). Prevalence (adjusted and weighted) increased with age, from 35.8% (35.1-36.5) in those aged 18 to 24 years, to 95.3% (94.6-95.9) in people 75 and over. Antibodies were 30% less likely to be detected in men than women (adjusted OR 0.69, 0.68-0.70), and were higher in people of Asian (OR 1.67 [1.58-1.77]), Black (1.55 [1.41-1.69]), mixed 1.17 [1.06-1.29] and other (1.37 [1.23-1.51]) ethnicities compared with white ethnicity. Workers in hospitality (OR 0.69 [0.63-0.74]) and retail (0.71 [0.67-0.75]) were less likely to have antibodies. Following two doses of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, antibody positivity (adjusted for test performance) was 100% (100-100) at all ages except 80 years and older when it was 97.8% (95.9-99.6). For AstraZeneca positivity was over 90% up to age 69, and then 89.2% (88.5-89.9) in 70-79 year olds and 83.6% (78.5-88.3) in those aged 80 and over. Following a single dose of Pfizer-BioNTech positivity ranged from 100.0% (91.1-100.0) in those aged 18-29 to 32.2% (18.2-51.1) in those aged 70-79 years. For AstraZeneca this was 72.2% (68.5-75.9) in the youngest and 46.2% (40.0-52.7) in the oldest age group. Discussion The successful roll out of the vaccination programme in England has led to a high proportion of individuals having detectable antibodies, particularly in older age groups and those who have had two doses of vaccine. This is likely to be associated with high levels of protection from severe disease, and possibly from infection. Nonetheless, there remain some key groups with a lower prevalence of antibody, notably unvaccinated younger people, certain minority ethnic groups, those living in deprived areas and workers in some public facing employment. Obtaining improved rates of vaccination in these groups is essential to achieving high levels of protection against the virus through population immunity.","Ward, H.; Whitaker, M.; Tang, S.

We build on work mapping the emergent landscape of corporate AI ethics to center one outcome of these conversations: the incorporation of diversity and inclusion in corporate AI ethics activities. Using interpretive document analysis and analytic tools from the values in design field, we examine how diversity and inclusion work is articulated in public-facing AI ethics documentation produced by three companies that create application and services layer AI infrastructure: Google, Microsoft, and Salesforce. We find that as these documents make diversity and inclusion more tractable to engineers and technical clients, they reveal a drift away from civil rights justifications that resonates with the managerialization of diversity by corporations in the mid-1980s. The focus on technical artifacts, such as diverse and inclusive datasets, and the replacement of equity with fairness make ethical work more actionable for everyday practitioners. Yet, they appear divorced from broader DEI initiatives and other subject matter experts that could provide needed context to nuanced decisions around how to operationalize these values. Finally, diversity and inclusion, as configured by engineering logic, positions firms not as ethics owners but as ethics allocators; while these companies claim expertise on AI ethics, the responsibility of defining who diversity and inclusion are meant to protect and where it is relevant is pushed downstream to their customers.","Chi, Nicole; Lurie, Emma; Mulligan, Deirdre K.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.02407v1.pdf,472

The focus area is Windhoek, the capitol of Namibia;a vast arid country, situated on the south-west coast of Africa, and home to one of the oldest deserts in the world. The planning paradigm in Windhoek continues to follow a suburbanisation strategy with a focus on the provision of equal technical services across the city, not realising that this urban model, with middle-class residents in mind, continues to promote exclusion of township residents in lieu of Western ideals. The research follows a broad assemblage approach to uncover the often-hidden relationships between social, environmental/ecological and economic systems at play in the city. The research is presented in the spirit of moving beyond the dichotomy of First World ‘models’ and Third World ‘problems’, to encourage policy approaches that seek to really learn from ‘developing’ countries.

The insecurity of the early phase, shutdowns, increasing infection rate and appearing SARS-CoV2 mutations have created a situation that makes live difficult especially for chronic diseases i.e. patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMD) and their treating physicians. The psychosocial burden that is created by this special situation is completely unknown and is estimated to be higher in patients than in the general population. Objectives: In order to measure the impact on our patients, the German COVID19-Rheuma patient survey was set up in April 2020, during Germany's first shut down. Methods: The German COVID19-Rheuma patient survey is a patient reported longitudinal online survey where patients with RMD who registered between April and July 2020 are asked on a monthly base using an online survey on social, personal, medical factors, whether a COVID19 infection occurred, isolation measures were changed and scores regarding stress and anxiety are recorded. Between April and July 2020, 637 patients registered and completed a first survey. Up to January 2021, about 400 patients are still enrolled. Here we present an interim analysis of the first 6 months regarding patients that were enrolled in April and May during the first shut-down. This first analysis compares the situation in the first lockdown to July, a phase with very low infection numbers in Germany, and to November, the beginning of the second lockdown. Results: 150 patients (87% female) were enrolled in April/early May 2020. Mean age was 48 years (range 11-89). The majority of patients suffered from rheumatoid arthritis (51%), followed by psoriatic arthritis (17%), other spondyloarthropathies (10%) and connective tissue diseases (10%). The majority of patients received antirheumatic therapies: 32% glucocorticoids (GC), 31% cDMARDs, 21% TNF inhibitors, 7% Jak inhibitors, and 9% other biologicals. Of the patients treated with GC, 25% were on GC monotherapy. In the first lockdown, 26% of patients were working remotely and 24% were self-isolating (doubles included). Additionally, 48% were using masks that were not mandatory at that time and 41% were using disinfection in a regular manner. The rates for remote work and self-isolation did not change significantly over time while the mask use increased to 98% with the official obligation to do so. The use of disinfectants increased to 88% in November. Regarding disease activity, no change in patient global assessment could be observed over time (4.3 ± 2.5 vs. 4.0 ±2.6 and 4.0 ± 2.5). Self-reported pain was also stable over time as were sleep disturbances. While 48.2% of patients who were receiving physiotherapy paused in April, only 10 and 14% did so in July and November, respectively. 11% of the patients paused their medication in the first lockdown, whereas only 2.75% did so in July and 3.4% in November. Contact with the treating rheumatologist was maintained over time in the majority of cases. Conclusion: While in the beginning of the pandemic the insecurity was considerable and the concern that the fear for infection would lead to inadequately treated patients with RMDs, we here show for the first time that on the one hand our patients were timely in taking adequate measures to keep themselves safe (e.g. self-isolating, mask use) and adapted to the clinical situation in not pausing their medication. Altogether, in this alert cohort, the pandemic did not lead to an increase of patient-reported disease activity in the first six months.","Hasseli, R.; Müller-Ladner, U.; Schmeiser, T.; Lorenz, H.

174330,The Effect of the COVID-19 Pandemic among Undergraduate Engineering Students in Jordanian Universities: Factors Impact Students' Learning Satisfaction,2021,"Background: Patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases (AIRD) may be at an increased risk for COVID-19 infection and poorer outcomes when compared with the general population. We undertook this study to estimate the risk of COVID-19 infection in our AIRD population and determine parameters which contribute to its occurrence. Methods: We prospectively recruited all consecutive AIRD patients on immunosuppressive therapy from 14 specialist rheumatology centers across south Indian state of Karnataka during current COVID-19 pandemic and followed them longitudinally. Results: Among 3807 participants, the majority were women (2.9:1), mean age was 43.8 (+14.3) years, rheumatoid arthritis (52.1%), and systemic lupus erythematosus (14.8%) were the most frequent diagnosis. Twenty-three (0.6%) patients contracted SARS-CoV-2 infection. Age &gt;60 years (P = 0.01), diabetes (P = 0.009), hypertension (P = 0.001), preexisting lung disease (P = 0.0002), current prescription of either angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blockers (P = 0.01), and higher glucocorticoids dosage (P = 0.002) were identified as potential risk factors in our cohort. The past use of cyclophosphamide (P = 0.0001) or mycophenolate mofeti (P = 0.003) or biologics (P = 0.001) also had a significant association with COVID-19 infection. Hydroxychloroquine use did not influence occurrence or outcome. The presence of underlying lung disease (relative risk - 3.08, 95% confidence interval - 1.21, 8.44, P = 0.029) was the only independent risk factor associated with the risk of COVID positivity in the multivariate analysis. Incidence rate of COVID-19 infection was similar to that of the general population (P = 0.22). Conclusions: The incidence of SARS CoV-2 infection in AIRD population is comparable to the general population. Underlying lung disease was the most important risk factor apart from older age, diabetes, hypertension, and a higher glucocorticoid dosage. © 2021 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

Engaging in a Tongan learning approach, such as fakalukuluku, can present a viable learning practice for tertiary students’ learning experiences. This paper presents the perspectives of four Tongan-born and raised researchers and educators who completed their tertiary education in Aotearoa New Zealand. Based on our experiences and reflections, we propose the Tongan concept of fakalukuluku as an approach to help elevate students’ academic achievement in tertiary education. Our paper conceptualises and unfolds perspectives of fakalukuluku, as a cultural practice that is appropriate, collaborative, and accorded learning stability because of its spiritual dimensions as being paramount to students’ success. We propose that a strong family and community support, the utilising of university learning support and the students’ spiritual beliefs can help Tongan students in tertiary education succeed. © 2021, Wilf Malcolm Institute of Educational Research.

Nonetheless, every community's physical environment is currently under siege from various EDCs, many of which are still unknown. EDCs affect the normal function of the endocrine, neurological, and immune systems, consequently diminishing successful development, reproductive adulthood, and decreasing survival. Beyond any doubt, adverse effects of EDCs are a consequence of multiple everyday exposures to hundreds of chemicals in unknown environmental doses such as pesticides, insecticides, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, dioxins, polychlorinated biphenyls, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, brominated flame retardants, and parabens. Considering that thousands of other known endocrine disruptors fly under the radar of scientific and medical communities due to existing methodological pitfalls, the situation is quite precarious. In 2012, the World Health Organization published a report emphasizing that EDCs are a major and emerging global public health threat. The combined power of informed consumers, industry innovations, and government regulations is the driving force in this fight. Therefore, research advancements, public health infrastructure, and environmental protection agencies are the fundamental pillars in combating the ever-growing issue of EDCs.","Polychronopoulos, E.

Mysterious disappearances of populations of the Neotropical, herdforming white-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari, henceforth “WLP”) have been anecdotally documented and explained as local events resulting from migratory movements or overhunting2,3,4, or as disease outbreaks5,6, and have not been considered in the context of large-scale species-specific population dynamics. Here we present evidence that WLP disappearances represent troughs in population cycles that occur with regular periodicity and are synchronized at regional and perhaps continent-wide spatial scales. Analysis of 43 disappearance events and 88 years of commercial and subsistence harvesting data reveals boom – bust population cycles lasting from 20 to 30 years, in which a rapid population crash occurring over 1 to 5 years is followed by a period of absence of 7 to12 years and then a slow growth phase. Overhunting alone cannot explain the crashes, but as in northern systems dispersal during the growth phase appears to play a key role.

This study investigated whether rumination might mediate this link during the highly stressful COVID-19 pandemic. Building on the distinction between the subtypes of rumination, we predicted that reflection and brooding would sequentially mediate this relationship and that maladaptive brooding would negatively influence life satisfaction. A representative sample of 316 adults was recruited from the greater Daegu area, where the first massive outbreak occurred in South Korea. After informed consent was obtained, they completed a package of questionnaires that included demographics, COVID-19-related experiences, perceived stress, life satisfaction, and rumination. A serial mediation analysis showed that reflection and brooding sequentially mediated the relationship between perceived stress and life satisfaction. As predicted, only brooding was negatively related to life satisfaction. In contrast, reflection per se was positively related to life satisfaction, and it negatively affected life satisfaction only through brooding. Our results extended the negative effect of brooding, as compared to reflection, in the pandemic. Given that reflection may easily turn into brooding under stress, it will be necessary to develop ways to guide people to counteract brooding while maintaining a reflective self-focus to preserve their well-being.","Kim, Bin-Na Kang Hyo Shin",Personality and Individual Differences,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2021.111169,472

From an experience-near perspective, I draw on concepts such as reverie, the frame, and holding;self psychological constructs such as self-states and empathy;and reference emotion regulation from the perspectives of neuroscience and social psychology.At a meta-level, this different way of working is unusually tiring because rapid change without warning in response to a pandemic—which is happening to therapists too—is intrinsically demanding. Anxiety is a key consideration. At a finer scale, I proffer a set of ideas regarding the implications for core aspects of the psychoanalytic scaffolding: how reverie can be hampered and confidentiality compromised;how holding can become less reliable, empathic attunement harder to maintain, and therapist self-cohesion disrupted. In consequence, the therapist has to work harder. The heightened importance of therapist self-care, ongoing professional development, and the need to hold the frame in mind, are suggested as strategies for ensuring clinically and ethically sound practice.","Padfield, Lisa Rae","Psychoanalysis, Self and Context",https://doi.org/10.1080/24720038.2021.1933986,472

At present PCR testing remains the standard method of diagnosing COVID-19 patients. Recently, testing for SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin was identified as a promising method of diagnosing COVID-19 and assessing an individual's exposure to the virus. In the current study, four different techniques-CLIA, ELISA, ECLIA, and rapid testing-were used to assess the IgG antibody response in 20 patients following COVID-19 exposure. The data obtained using the CLIA and ELISA techniques illustrated that 90 percent of COVID-19 patients produced the SARS-COV-2 IgG antibody. Processing samples using the ECLIA method showed that these antibodies were present in 80 percent of all patients;however, the rapid testing technique showed that only 70 percent of patients were able to generate an immune response. The CLIA and ELISA techniques seemed to be more sensitive in terms of detecting SARS-COV-2 IgG, as they revealed that a high percentage of COVID-19 patients developed the IgG antibody. Conducting further research on the ongoing pandemic COVID-19, particularly studying antibody testing, will be valuable for diagnosing and monitoring patients.","Ali, Hazazi Waleed Alomaim Mohammed Almubarak Fawaz Albloui Omer Alsaweed Waleed Tamimi Rabaan A.

Objectives To estimate seropositivity among confirmed COVID-19 cases and to correlate the seropositivity with various factors affecting seropositivity. Methods Population-based sero-surveillance among COVID-19 cases was carried out during the second half of August 2020 in Ahmedabad using the COVID KAVACH, Immunoglobulin-G (IgG) Antibody Detection Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) kits. Seropositivity among cases was measured and compared with various other factors to understand the immunity status among COVID-19 cases. Results With 1073 positive for IgG antibodies from 1720 samples, the seropositivity among COVID-19 cases is 62.38% [95%CI 60.07-64.64%]. The difference in seropositivity based on gender was statistically not significant (Z=0.26, P=0.79). Children have the highest seropositivity (94.44%) and from young adults, to the elderly, the proportion of positivity among cases shows an increasing trend. Time gap analysis from the date of diagnosis shows that the proportion of cases with IgG antibodies increases gradually reaching its peak at around 10 weeks (third month) and then declines gradually. Conclusion Seropositivity among COVID-19 cases is 62.38%. The proportion of cases with IgG antibodies reaches its peak at around 10 weeks (third month) after diagnosis and then declines gradually. This fall indicates that the detected antibodies may not be long-lasting and may become undetectable/absent over a period of time. The reason for seronegative results in COVID-19 cases needs further in-depth scientific research.","Prakash, O.; Solanki, B.; Sheth, J.

From making deliveries, dispensing medication, visiting patients to aiding surgeries, robots are improving the way hospitals function. Central Sterilization Supply Department (CSSD) offers sterilization amenities to Outpatient Department (OPDs), wards and operation theatre (OT) of hospitals. It provides facilities to receive, clean, pack, disinfects, sterilizes, store and distribute instruments, in accordance with well-delineated protocols and standardizes procedures. An alarming boost in Hospital Ac-quired Infections (HAI) demonstrates the necessity of a well-organized CSSD to prevent surge in HAI. Although quality assurance procedures are followed to ensure safety and efficiency at all levels: appropriate handling of contaminated items, decontamination, proper cleansing, and instrument care, but the necessity of human presence to implement these procedure in-creases the threat of HAI. Thus, an intelligent autonomous multi-sensor wireless controlled NXT robot using MATLAB is proposed to handle contaminated items and sterilize equipments in the centralized sterilization sup-ply department. The proposed system is entirely automated and eliminates the need of human presence to implement quality assurance procedures, thus decreasing the threat of HAI. An archetype using Lego NXT robotic kit is developed to implement tasks performed in CSSD. MATLAB is used to control NXT robot instead of Lego Mindstorms software, due to its versatility, capability to perform computationally intensive tasks and wide usage by researchers.

Rapid detection of changes in IAV specificity towards host glycan classes can provide early indication of virus transmissibility and infection potential. IAVs use hemagglutinins (HA) to bind sialic acids linked to larger glycan structures and a switch in HA specificity from α2,3-to α2,6-linked sialoglycans is considered a prerequisite for viral transmission from birds to humans. While the changes in HA structure associated with the evolution of binding phenotype have been mapped, the influence of glycan receptor presentation on IAV specificity remains obscured. Here, we describe a glycan array platform which uses synthetic mimetics of mucin glycoproteins to model how receptor presentation in the mucinous glycocalyx, including glycan type and valency of the glycoconjugates and their surface density, impact IAV binding. We found that H1N1 virus produced in embryonated chicken eggs, which recognizes both receptor types, exclusively engaged mucin-mimetics carrying α2,3-linked sialic acids in their soluble form. The virus was able utilize both receptor structures when the probes were immobilized on the array; however, increasing density in the mucin-mimetic brush diminished viral adhesion. Propagation in mammalian cells produced a change in receptor pattern recognition by the virus, without altering its HA affinity, toward improved binding of α2,6-sialylated mucin mimetics and reduced sensitivity to surface crowding of the probes. Application of a support vector machine (SVM) learning algorithm as part of the glycan array binding analysis efficiently characterized this shift in binding preference and may prove useful to study the evolution of viral responses to a new host.","Lucas, Taryn M.; Gupta, Chitrak; Altman, Meghan O.; Sanchez, Emi; Naticchia, Matthew R.; Gagneux, Pascal; Singharoy, Abhishek; Godula, Kamil",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.17.440161,472

However, it is not clear what changes are observed in the cells of the main gate of infection – the mucosa of the mouth and the nose at different clinical forms and at different periods of disease. Understanding the ultra-structural cell changes of SARS-CoV-2 targets may help clarify the pathogenic aspects of infection in the lower respiratory tract. In this study, the elements of the life cycle of SARS-CoV-2 virus in the cells of the respiratory epithelium of the nose in patients with COVID-19 were evaluated using electron microscopy for the purpose of detecting the peculiarities of viral activity depending on the form and period of disease. Bioptats of the nasal mucous membrane were taken from COVID-19 patients and subsequently examined by electron microscopy. The severity of structural changes in tissue samples, presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus in cells were determined, then bioptats were grouped according to the clinical form of the infection process (inapparent, acute upper respiratory tract infections, viral lung disease) and period of disease. It has been established that the most characteristic changes in the mucous membrane of the nose were observed in the first week of infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 and occurring in the form of acute respiratory disease, while viral lung infections have had the highest virus density in vesicles within cells, the formation of smooth virus-free vesicles is most common in inapparent forms. The data obtained may indicate that the formation of classical virus-induced changes in the respiratory epithelium of the nose mucous (vesicles with viral particles and signs of their release from the cell) is characteristic of localized forms of infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 (respiratory infection of the upper respiratory tract) and in cases of generalized infection (viral infection of the lungs and probably other organs and systems) accumulation of the infectious agent in high concentrations in vesicles.","Kryukov, E.

The sudden and largely unprepared transition to emergency remote teaching placed serious pressures on not only students, but also academics, the families of both, and also other stakeholders as well. This study aims to discuss the potential effects of emergency remote teaching due to COVID-19 on disadvantaged students in higher education. Materials/methods – This study is a review article, which presents a brief literature review on the potential impact of emergency remote teaching due to COVID-19 on disadvantaged students in higher education. Practical implications – This study may help to provide researchers and practitioners with a roadmap for potential future work on the impact of emergency remote teaching in response to the COVID-19 pandemic on disadvantaged groups. From this perspective, the potential effect of emergency remote teaching on disadvantaged students in higher education is examined and recommendations put forwards for solutions aimed at educational administrators and decision-makers. Conclusion – The emergency remote teaching put in place due to the COVID-19 pandemic has led to the widening of the digital divide among higher education students. Therefore, integrating the digital and distance education approach into the higher education system correctly and effectively may both facilitate the achievement of instructional goals and also help to eliminate digital inequality in the higher education student population.

However, the long-term respiratory outcomes of severe viral pneumonia, including its association with pulmonary fibrosis, are less known. Objective: To determine whether viral pneumonia is associated with an increased incidence of post-inflammatory pulmonary fibrosis. Design: We performed two retrospective observational cohort studies using longitudinal hospitalization records from the States of California (2005-2011) and Florida (2009-2015) for the discovery and validation studies, respectively. Patients who were 85-years-old and younger with at least two hospital encounters but without a prior diagnosis of pulmonary fibrosis were included. International Classification of Diseases-9 (ICD9) codes of primary and secondary diagnoses and procedures were used to identify the exposure: diagnosis of viral pneumonia; the outcome: incidence of post-inflammatory pulmonary fibrosis [PIPF, ICD9: 515]; and the confounders. Methods: Chronological age was used as the study time scale. Non-parametric Kaplan-Meier (KM) estimator and semiparametric Cox Proportional Hazard modelling were used to assessing the risk of PIPF. P-values < 10-3 were considered significant. Results: Among 9,802,565 patients from California and 8,741,345 patients in Florida cohorts, the prevalence of PIPF was 0.61% and 0.62% over 7 and 6.75 years, respectively. Patients with incident PIPF were older than those without [68(SD: 11) vs. 40(22) years]; among patients with PIPF, those with viral pneumonia diagnosis were younger than those without [63(12) versus 68(11) years]. Incidence of PIPF was higher for those with viral pneumonia diagnosis versus those without [1.6 (CI:1.51-1.69) vs. 0.91 (CI:0.86-0.96)] cases per 1000 person-years in California and in Florida [1.11 (CI:1.06 -1.16) vs, 0.93 (CI:0.89-0.98)]. Viral pneumonia was associated with increased risk of incident PIPF in both California aHR = 1.49 (1.38, 1.61), and Florida aHR of 1.26 (1.20, 1.33) cohorts (Table). Among patients who developed PIPF, the median time to diagnosis was 7.41 (6.16 -8.66) and 4.80 (4.34 - 5.26) years earlier for patients with viral pneumonia versus without in California and Florida cohorts. The association of viral pneumonia was not found for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [ICD9: 516.3]. Our findings suggest that patients hospitalized with viral pneumonia may have long term respiratory sequela that is often overlooked and suggest a need for additional studies focusing on phenotyping susceptible patients. This finding is especially important in light of the current COVID-19 pandemic because viral pneumonia is the most common manifestations of the disease, which could lead to subsequent fibrosis.","Shojaee, A.; Dela Cruz, C.; Siner, J.; Zinchuk, A.; Kaminski, N.; Aryan, Y.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.08.21252412v1?rss=1,472

Besides the high number of fatalities, economic and societal impact, the virus has also raised a question on the current approaches and methodologies for combatting pandemics. An important factor in this global fight against the pandemic, is the fact that key experts within the fields of biotechnology, virology and immunology have to return to the drawing board to develop new approaches to treat the virus. This has triggered a multi and inter-disciplinary research drive to bring in new concepts, techniques and methodologies that can be used to understand the virus in order to develop novel treatment techniques. The field of molecular communications, which is just over a decade old, is one area of research in the field of communications and networking that can contribute towards understanding of virus and their infection process. This is the aim of this special issue, where we have collected a number of publications from key researchers in the field of molecular communications that can contribute towards understanding the viral properties and behavior, which can be used to support the current as well as future pandemics.","Balasubramaniam, S.; Barros, M.

At Cambridge University Hospitals, the COVID-19 pandemic initially prompted almost all face-to-face appointments to be delivered by telephone, providing a uniquely unselected population to assess. Objectives: We explored patient and clinician experience of telephone consultations; and whether telephone consultations might be preferable for pre-identifiable subgroups of patients after the pandemic. Methods: Clinicians delivering neurological consultations converted to telephone between April-July 2020 were invited to complete a questionnaire following each consult (430 respondents) and the corresponding patients were subsequently surveyed (290 respondents). The questionnaires assessed clinician and patient goal achievement (and the reasons for any dissatisfaction). Clinicians also described consultation duration (in comparison to face-to-face) while patients detailed comparative convenience and preference. Results: The majority of clinicians (335/430, 78%) and patients (227/290, 78%) achieved their consultation goals by telephone, particularly during follow-up consultations (clinicians 272/329, 83%, patients 176/216, 81%) and in some disease subgroups (e.g. seizures/epilepsy (clinicians 114/122 (93%), patients 71/81 (88%)). 95% of telephone consultations were estimated to take the same or less time than an equivalent face-to-face consultation. Most patients found telephone consultations convenient (69%) with 149/211 (71%) indicating they would like telephone or video consultations to play some role in their future follow-up. Conclusion: Telephone consultations appear effective, convenient and popular in prespecified subgroups of neurological outpatients. Further work comparing telephone, video and face-to-face consultations across multiple centres is now needed.","Nakornchai, T.; Conci, E.; Hensiek, A.; Brown, J. W.

178804,Transitioning to online education in English departments in Bangladesh: Learner perspectives,2021,"Purpose: The purpose of the present study is twofold. First, the study will investigate the importance of tradition for businesses operating during the COVID-19 crisis, notably, as a valuable proposition and strategy. Second, the study seeks to advance theoretical understanding, proposing two frameworks based upon emerging dimensions, the resource-based view and dynamic capabilities. Design/methodology/approach: An online survey gathered the views of 107 predominantly micro and small-scale owner-manager and family-owned firms involved in the food and wine sector. These participants are based in Italy, one of the hardest-hit countries in the crisis. Findings: Three fundamental dimensions emerge from the findings. The first, “embedded advantage”, concerns firms' more direct involvement and tradition-related actions. The second, “active advantage”, highlights the already established value of tradition, for example, through firm identity gained, well-established roots and firm culture. The third dimension, “strategic fusion”, underscores the importance of upgrading the business model, where innovation complements tradition strategically. Originality/value: The study's revealed dimensions provide new conceptual perspectives to understand tradition in the context of firms confronting an unprecedented event. The first proposed theoretical framework illustrates that firms appear to mainly rely on tradition as the fundamental pillar of their overall strategy. Additionally, other firms engage in actions to consolidate tradition's strategic significance, while others embrace innovation to further strengthen their competitiveness. The second framework emphasises relations between these dimensions and key attributes associated with the two adopted theoretical foundations, where the need to “reconfigure tradition” clearly emerges. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Bressan, A.; Duarte Alonso, A.; Vu, O.

Prior studies suggest SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells are present in peripheral blood 10 months after infection. Further analysis of the function, durability, and diversity of the cellular response long after natural infection, over a wider range of ages and disease phenotypes, is needed to further identify preventative and therapeutic interventions. Methods We identified participants in our multi-site longitudinal, prospective cohort study 12-months post SARS-CoV-2 infection representing a range of disease severity. We investigated the function, phenotypes, and frequency of T cells specific for SARS-CoV-2 using intracellular cytokine staining and spectral flow cytometry. In parallel, the magnitude of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies was compared. Results SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies and T cells were detected at 12-months post-infection. Severity of acute illness was associated with higher frequencies of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T cells and antibodies at 12-months. In contrast, polyfunctional and cytotoxic T cells responsive to SARS-CoV-2 were identified in participants over a wide spectrum of disease severity. Conclusions Our data show that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces polyfunctional memory T cells detectable at 12-months post-infection, with higher frequency noted in those who originally experienced severe disease.","Lu, Zhongyan; Laing, Eric D.; Pena-Damata, Jarina; Pohida, Katherine; Tso, Marana S.; Samuels, Emily C.; Epsi, Nusrat J.; Dorjbal, Batsukh; Lake, Camille; Richard, Stephanie A.; Maves, Ryan C.; Lindholm, David A.; Rozman, Julia; English, Caroline; Huprikar, Nikhil; Mende, Katrin; Colombo, Rhonda E.; Colombo, Christopher J.; Broder, Christopher C.; Ganesan, Anuradha; Lanteri, Charlotte A.; Agan, Brian K.; Tribble, David; Simons, Mark P.; Dalgard, Clifton L.; Blair, Paul W.; Chenoweth, Josh; Pollett, Simon D.; Snow, Andrew L.; Burgess, Timothy H.; Malloy, Allison M.W.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.11.455984,472

However, few empirical reports have been published on its impact on occupational therapists. Clarifying the mental health status of occupational therapists is important to maintain care quality and prevent psychological problems in this population. Objective: To investigate the psychological impact of COVID-19 on Japanese occupational therapists in prefectures with and without severe pandemic-related restrictions and elucidate factors associated with psychological problems such as anxiety, depression, and insomnia. Design: A cross-sectional online survey using region-stratified two-stage cluster sampling conducted May 28-31, 2020. Participants: The sample included 371 participants (63.1% women) in the prefectures under specific cautions (i.e., where residents were strictly advised to refrain from outings) and 1,312 in the prefectures without such cautions (61.9% women). Results: The increase in workload due to the pandemic was significantly related to an increase in anxiety, depression, and insomnia, and an attempt to avoid talking face to face with others was significantly related to an increase in anxiety regardless of area. In prefectures under specific cautions as of May 25, 2020, the provision of sufficient information on COVID-19 by the workplace significantly reduced the risk of insomnia. In other prefectures, the provision of sufficient information significantly reduced the risk of depression. Conclusions and Relevance: These results demonstrate the severe negative psychological impact of the increase in workload resulting from COVID-19 and suggest the importance of psychological support for occupational therapists, such as the provision of sufficient information by the workplace.

In this study, we aimed to evaluate the factors associated with 28-day outcomes in patients admitted to the intensive care unit with the diagnosis of COVID-19. Method: This study has a retrospective cohort design. COVID-19 patients identified according to World Health Organization guidelines are included. Patient data were recorded to a centralized system utilizing ImdSoft-Meta vision/QlinICU Clinical Decision Support Software. Individual datasets about required parameters were obtained from Structured Query Language (SQL) queries. The main laboratory parameters were examined. SOFA, APACHE II, and Charlson Comorbidity Score (CCS) were calculated. In evaluating laboratory parameters and disease risk scores, which are thought to affect 28-day mortality, logistic analysis were performed using the Backward LR model. Results: The study was carried out with 101 patients, 40 (39.6%) of whom were women, and 61 (60.4%) of men, who met the inclusion criteria. The ages of the patients ranged from 21 to 88, and the mean age was 58.45 +/- 15.41 years. The mean intensive care hospitalization period was 12.5 +/- 10.2 days. The all-cause in-hospital mortality rate was 61.4%. Leukocyte count, CK, NT-proBNP, PCT, CRP, ferritin, neutrophil count and percentage, D-Dimer, LDH, AST values were found to be significantly higher in non-survivors. The lymphocyte count and percentage, and platelet count values were found to be significantly low in non-survivors. The lymphocyte percentage, LDH, and CCS were significant in the 28-day mortality in multivariate analysis (p values are 0.01, 0.003, 0.008, respectively). Conclusion: High lymphocyte values have been found to significantly reduce the risk of death in patients diagnosed with COVID-19.

However, it is unknown whether there is an association between ADT and a higher survival in prostate cancer patients with COVID-19. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of prostate cancer (PC) patients hospitalized to treat COVID-19 in Brazil's public health system. We compared patients with the active use of ADT versus those with non-active ADT, past use. We constructed propensity score models of patients in active versus non-active use of ADT. All variables were used to derive propensity score estimation, and for the outcome analysis we performed a multivariate backward elimination process to select variables to add to the propensity score model. Results: We analyzed 109 PC patients with COVID-19 that presented past or current use of ADT. In total, 52.8% of our patients were less than 75 years old, 44.0% (48/109) were in active ADT, and most were using a GnRH analog (73%, 35/48). Also, 63.3% of our cohort died from COVID-19. ADT active use were protective factor in our logistic regression model (OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.12-0.66, P = 0.0036). We noticed a significant imbalance in the propensity score of patients in active and those in non-active ADT. Then, when we performed a propensity score-based inverse weight double robust estimation model, we observed that ADT remained statistically associated with improved overall survival (average treatment effect [ATE] -0.26, 95% CI -0.45 to -0.08, P = 0.0058). Conclusions: The active use of ADT was associated with a reduced risk of death in patients with COVID-19.","Duarte, M. B. O.; Leal, F.; Argenton, J. L. P.; Carvalheira, J. B.

The World Health Organization (WHO) prescribed border closure, lockdown, social distancing, wearing a mask, and handwashing to combat the pandemic. These control measures, especially the closure of borders, have affected the importation and supply of fertilizer for crop production. The current study presents potential expectations for the adverse effects of coronavirus pandemic on fertilizer supply and application, soil fertility, and crop yield. The study indicates that the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic has made the delivery of fertilizers to farmers very difficult. Hence, the application of fertilizer on time by farmers was problematic. It was also discovered that the COVID-19 control measure enforced can delay crop planting on time and the use of optimum quality and quantity of fertilizer. Therefore, crop yield will be affected and the quantity of crop produced will be reduced.","Hanyabui, E.; Apori, S.

In this context, it is attempted to reveal the effects of independent variables on CO2 (dependent variable) for China from 1980 to 2013 (annual data) by implementing Phillips-Perron (PP), Zivot-Andrews unit root tests, FMOLS, DOLS, CCR, ARDL and GMM methods. According to results of FMOLS, DOLS and CCR models there is a long-term stable relationship between sea transportation, trade liberalization, industrial development and carbon dioxide emissions which is proved empirically. Similarly, Short term ARDL estimation results reveal that the main determinants of CO2 in the short-run are changed in industrial development and maritime transport at 1% significance level. Table 6 summarizes the short-term ARDL results and the findings regarding the error correction model. According to Table 6, error correction model works in order to reach short-run adjustment. In the short term, approximately 78% of shocks in industrial development, maritime transport and trade liberalization are compensated within a period of time and the system is re-established in the long term. China produced half of the 1.2 million electric media used worldwide; the government directs its attention to the rehabilitation and reuse of all these lithium-ion batteries. Large-scale production of biofuels can still be several years away. Crude oil might be very difficult to promote alternative fuels on a national scale unless crude oil prices surge so high as to become unaffordable. Authorities underline: China will become the world’s number one economy. Now renewable energy will be more important, which should be encouraged to use by government on transportation so as to reduce the CO2 emissions. However, China can be leader excess oil use for transport if they want to dominate the economy worldwide.","Kalaycı, Salih; Özden, Cihan",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.13.200386,472

Already in 2019, many habits of users concerning online shopping platforms have changed: the age of those buying online has risen, the average income has fallen and the contagion has reached all urban and rural areas, even the smaller towns and villages. Since March 2020, when increased restrictions were applied, an increase in shopping of various kinds in several European and non-European countries is recorded. Many operators had to modify their logistics and change their interfaces. In short, the emergency has given a huge cultural boost to e-commerce. Tens of thousands of small retailers found themselves in the position of not being able to welcome consumers into their shops or being forced to create e-shops in a very short period of time and thus they identified home delivery as an opportunity not to be missed. Remote payment was the first, but not the only, effect. The present paper analyses the correlation between online shopping habits and socio-demographic characteristics in 27 European countries. The results were obtained from a descriptive statistical evaluation and the correlation between the variables was defined by the chi-square calculation.

This problem also affected major steel market players, who, among other things, were forced to work out options to develop in the face of a sharp decline in prices for the industry products. At the same time, the behavior of most steel producers was not systematic, was built spontaneously, and did not enable the company to overcome emerging difficulties. At the same time, a number of large corporations were able to quickly adapt to new conditions and prevent the decline of their companies thanks to well-established organizational strategies. In general, this experience has become an important tool for flexible corporate management during the period of the need to restructure the business format.

To alleviate this spread, various blockade policies have been implemented in many areas. This has led to a sluggish demand in the world's major economies, sharp drop in the trade index, and negative growth in energy consumption. To formulate a better epidemic prevention policy for urban energy consumption of commercial tourism cities, this study summarizes the major statistics of energy supply and demand before and during the epidemic period based on actual data. The characteristics of energy consumption in different sectors, including hotels, transportation, tourism culture, and public utilities, are then analyzed in detail. Finally, the energy consumption features of commercial tourism cities represented by Macao are compared to those of other typical countries (e.g., Italy, United States, Japan, and Brazil). These analyses demonstrate the impact of COVID-19 on the energy consumption in commercial tourism cities, which provides insights for the government or energy providers to formulate policies to adapt to this pandemic.","Zhang, Dongdong Li Hongyi Zhu Hongyu Zhang Hongcai Goh Hui Huang Wong Man Chung Wu Thomas",Sustainable Cities and Society,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scs.2021.103133,472
181395,Remote Learning Barriers and Opportunities for Graduate Student and Postdoctoral Learners in Career and Professional Skill Development: A Case Study,2020-10-08,"Purpose: The study aims to co-create a “priority action roadmap for women's economic empowerment” based on women's top priorities to charting recovery directions. Doing so contributes to the growing body of knowledge on COVID-19 literature in at least four areas: assessing COVID-19 impacts on women entrepreneurs;mapping these impacts with four interdependent women's entrepreneurial ecosystem components;innovating a co-creation methodology based on remote participatory research;and providing a replicable model to perform action-oriented research in the context of COVID-19 impacts. Design/methodology/approach: A co-creation methodology is proposed, combining systems-thinking and remote participatory research to engage women entrepreneurs and institutional stakeholders to prioritize impact, response actions and recovery needs in the wake of COVID-19. A ranking exercise using the analytic hierarchy process was used to derive ranking and assess user inputs' consistency. Findings: The study exemplifies the integration of participatory methods and mathematical tool to engage stakeholders in prioritizing recovery work. PARWEE action items ranked by entrepreneurs and vetted by institutional stakeholders cover: access to finances, capacity building, health care, public and private partnership, marketing opportunities and formation of active advocacy groups to voice out women entrepreneurs' needs to institutional stakeholders. Results show a slight difference in the ranking of priority actions between experience owners and fresh starters. Originality/value: This study innovated a new co-creation methodology for remotely engaging stakeholders of the women's entrepreneurial ecosystem, which is grounded in evidence and provides a replicable model for performing action-oriented research. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Bonin, S.; Singh, W.; Suresh, V.; Rashed, T.; Uppaal, K.; Nair, R.; Bhavani, R.

181724,International Collaboration in the Field of Educational Research: A Delphi Study,2021,"An essential element of adaptive immunity is the selective binding of peptide antigens by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I proteins and their presentation to cytotoxic T lymphocytes on the cell surface. Using native mass spectrometry, we here analyze the binding of peptides to an empty disulfide-stabilized HLA-A*02:01 molecule. This novel approach allows us to examine the binding properties of diverse peptides. The unique stability of our MHC class I even enables us to determine the binding affinity of complexes, which are suboptimally loaded with truncated or charge-reduced peptides. Notably, a unique erucamide adduct decouples affinity analysis from peptide identity alleviating issues usually attributed to clustering during electrospray ionization. We discovered that two anchor positions at the binding surface between MHC and peptide can be stabilized independently and further identify the contribution of other peptidic amino acids on the binding. We propose this as an alternative, likely universally applicable method to artificial prediction tools to estimate the binding strength of peptides to MHC class I complexes quickly and efficiently. This newly described MHC class I-peptide binding affinity quantitation represents a much needed orthogonal, independent approach to existing computational affinity predictions and has the potential to eliminate binding affinity biases and thus accelerate drug discovery in infectious diseases, autoimmunity, vaccine design, and cancer immunotherapy.","Kopicki, Janine-Denise; Saikia, Ankur; Niebling, Stephan; Günther, Christian; Garcia-Alai, Maria; Springer, Sebastian; Uetrecht, Charlotte",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.12.455998,472

There have been various attempts to manage COVID-19 and other pandemics using technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G/6G communications. However, we also need to ensure that IoT devices used to facilitate COVID-19 monitoring and treatment (e.g., medical IoT devices) are secured, as the compromise of such devices can have significant consequences (e.g., life-threatening risks to COVID-19 patients). Hence, in this paper we comprehensively survey existing IoT-related solutions, potential security and privacy risks and their requirements. For example, we classify existing security and privacy solutions into five categories, namely: authentication and access control solutions, key management and cryptography solutions, blockchain-based solutions, intrusion detection systems, and privacy-preserving solutions. In each category, we identify the associated challenges. We also identify a number of recommendations to inform future research.","Ferrag, M. A.; Shu, L.; Choo, K. K.

181930,The Effects of Disciplinary Composition on Virtual Learning Group Process Dynamics: Students’ Perspectives,2021,"Proximity tracing apps have been proposed as an aide in dealing with the COVID-19 crisis. Some of those apps leverage attenuation of Bluetooth beacons from mobile devices to build a record of proximate encounters between a pair of device owners. The underlying protocols are known to suffer from false positive and re-identification attacks. We present evidence that the attacker's difficulty in mounting such attacks has been overestimated. Indeed, an attacker leveraging a moderately successful app or SDK with Bluetooth and location access can eavesdrop and interfere with these proximity tracing systems at no hardware cost and perform these attacks against users who do not have this app or SDK installed. We describe concrete examples of actors who would be in a good position to execute such attacks. We further present a novel attack, which we call a biosurveillance attack, which allows the attacker to monitor the exposure risk of a smartphone user who installs their app or SDK but who does not use any contact tracing system and may falsely believe that they have opted out of the system. Through traffic auditing with an instrumented testbed, we characterize precisely the behaviour of one such SDK that we found in a handful of apps---but installed on more than one hundred million mobile devices. Its behaviour is functionally indistinguishable from a re-identification or biosurveillance attack and capable of executing a false positive attack with minimal effort. We also discuss how easily an attacker could acquire a position conducive to such attacks, by leveraging the lax logic for granting permissions to apps in the Android framework: any app with some geolocation permission could acquire the necessary Bluetooth permission through an upgrade, without any additional user prompt. Finally we discuss motives for conducting such attacks.","Dehaye, Paul-Olivier; Reardon, Joel",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.06077v1.pdf,472

This study aimed to investigate the effects of treatment with INF-β 1-a (interferon beta-1a) and IFN-β 1-b (interferon beta-1b) on COVID-19 inpatients. Methods In this study, we retrospectively evaluated the clinical treatment outcomes of 100 patients with COVID-19 who received IFN-β 1-a and IFN-β 1-b during their hospitalization period. The rate of discharge from the hospital was considered equal to the clinical improvement and then evaluated as a primary outcome. Moreover, mortality, ICU admission and length of ICU stay, frequency of intubation and use of mechanical ventilation, duration of hospitalization, laboratory factors, and medications were assessed as secondary outcomes. Results The median discharge time of IFN-β 1a recipients was approximately equal to that of IFN-β 1-b recipients as 9 (5-10) days and 7 (5-11) days, respectively (HR = 2.43, P = 0.75). Mortality rate was also estimated as 10% among IFN-β 1-a recipients and 14% among IFN-β 1-b recipients, which was not statistically significant (p = 0.190). ICU hospitalization rate for the IFN-β 1-a recipients and IFN-β 1-b recipients was 26% and 36%, respectively. In addition, no significant difference was found between these two intervention groups in terms of ICU length of stay (1 (0-2) vs. 1 (0-4.25(, respectively,) P = 0.357). There was no significant difference between the two study groups in terms of frequency of mechanical ventilation and length of hospital stay.

Methods: COVID-19 related knowledge was evaluated through following items: clinical presentations, age of infection, transmission routes, self-reported preventive behaviors, patient's approach in case of suspicion of being infected by COVID-19 and vaccination. We also investigated the source of the patients' information. Believes and fears of patients regarding COVID-19 was assessed using 2 items that explored participant's perception of the degree of threat to public health and their individual infection susceptibility compared to the general population. Results: A cross-sectional study was conducted among patients with rheumatic diseases using a questionnaire providing information on patients and disease characteristics. 350 patients had participated in this online survey (mean age of 46,1 ± 14,4, 68% were women, 15.7% were illiterate, 45.7% were unemployed, rural residence in 11.7% of cases). The correct answer rates of the 6 questions of the knowledge section of the questionnaire were 53.4-100% with an average mean of 90.7%. The mean COVID-19 knowledge score was 5,43/6 (SD:0,48). Most participants (96.6%) correctly identified the age group concerned about Covid-19 infection. Remarkably 92.3% of the participants recognized 3 clinical features when 97.7% and 72.3% of the sample recognized perfectly modes of transmission and disease prevention measures. 87.4% of patients knew the recommended course of action to do if they have fever or cough and have recently been in contact with an infected patient. 64% of the study population thought that there was no vaccine available yet. The sources of information on COVID-19 were in descending order: rheumatologist (56.6 %), personal research (on the internet or other) (43.4%), video broadcasts on national television channels (28%), other Awareness Video (24.2%). Regarding the patients believes and fears toward COVID-19, 81.7% of patients believed that the pandemic is a serious threat for the public health and 80.6% thought that their CIRD makes them more exposed to the risk of contamination than general population. Conclusion: The results of this survey show a high prevalence of patient concern about COVID-19. However, the majority of patients responded correctly on the mode of transmission and the means of protection for the COVID-19 infection. Those results could be explained by enormous awareness-raising efforts carried out by our differents departments of our government.","El Joumani, T.; Rkain, H.; Fatima Zahrae, T.; Kenza, H.; Radouan, A.; Laila, N.; Bahloul, S.; Nada, E.

To explore cross-market linkages, we distinguish between regular interdependence and pure contagion, and associate changes in the correlation between stock market returns at higher frequencies with contagion, whereas changes at lower frequencies are associated with interdependence that relates to spillovers of shocks resulting from the normal interdependence between markets. An empirical analysis undertaken on six major stock markets reveals evidence of long-run interdependence between the markets under consideration before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in December 2019. However, after the health crisis began, strong evidence of pure contagion among stock markets was detected.","Alqaralleh, Huthaifa Canepa Alessandra",Journal of Risk and Financial Management,https://doi.org/10.3390/jrfm14070329,472

The purpose of this study was to compare how treatment with convalescent plasma (CP) monotherapy, remdesivir (RDV) monotherapy, and combination therapy (CP + RDV) in patients with COVID-19 affected clinical outcomes. Methods: This retrospective observational study was conducted between May-August 2020 at a 150-bed academic community hospital in San Joaquin County, California. Patients with COVID-19 infection who were hospitalized during the study period received CP, RDV, or a combination of both. Clinical outcomes including mortality, discharge disposition, hospital length of stay, ICU length of stay, and total ventilation days were compared between each treatment group and stratified by ABO blood group. An exploratory analysis identified risk factors for mortality. Adverse effects were also evaluated. Results: A total of 213 patients with COVID-19 were admitted and 106 patients received one of the three prespecified treatments during the study period. 53 received CP alone, 11 received RDV alone, and 42 received combination therapy. RDV monotherapy showed an increased chance of survival compared to combination therapy or CP monotherapy (p = 0.052) (Figure 1). There were 15, 3, and 6 deaths in the CP, RDV, and CP + RDV groups, respectively. The median number of ventilation days was the longest in the CP + RDV group (8, IQR 4.5-14, p = 0.091). The median ICU length of stay was also longest in the CP + RDV group (8, IQR 4.5-15.5, p = 0.220). The median hospital length of stay was longest in the CP group (11, IQR 7-15.5, p = 0.175). Age (p = 0.036), initial SOFA score (p = 0.013), and intubation (p = 0.005) were statistically significant predictors of mortality. Patients with type O blood had less ventilation days, ICU LOS, and total LOS but the difference was not statistically significant. Thirteen treatment-related adverse events occurred. Conclusion: No significant differences in clinical outcomes including mortality, length of stay, or total ventilator days were observed between hospitalized patients with COVID 19 treated with RDV, CP, or CP + RDV. Elderly patients, those with a high initial SOFA score, and those who require intubation are at increased risk of mortality associated with COVID-19.

194261,Here we go again? A new pandemic of the 21st century.,2020-04-03,"CONTEXT Public and private financial support of biomedical research have increased over the past decade. Few comprehensive analyses of the sources and uses of funds are available. This results in inadequate information on which to base investment decisions because not all sources allow equal latitude to explore hypotheses having scientific or clinical importance and creates a barrier to judging the value of research to society. OBJECTIVE To quantify funding trends from 1994 to 2004 of basic, translational, and clinical biomedical research by principal sponsors based in the United States. DESIGN Publicly available data were compiled for the federal, state, and local governments; foundations; charities; universities; and industry. Proprietary (by subscription but openly available) databases were used to supplement public sources. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Total actual research spending, growth rates, and type of research with inflation adjustment. RESULTS Biomedical research funding increased from 37.1 billion dollars in 1994 to 94.3 billion dollars in 2003 and doubled when adjusted for inflation. Principal research sponsors in 2003 were industry (57%) and the National Institutes of Health (28%). Relative proportions from all public and private sources did not change. Industry sponsorship of clinical trials increased from 4.0 dollars to 14.2 billion dollars (in real terms) while federal proportions devoted to basic and applied research were unchanged. The United States spent an estimated 5.6% of its total health expenditures on biomedical research, more than any other country, but less than 0.1% for health services research. From an economic perspective, biotechnology and medical device companies were most productive, as measured by new diagnostic and therapeutic devices per dollar of research and development cost. Productivity declined for new pharmaceuticals. CONCLUSIONS Enhancing research productivity and evaluation of benefit are pressing challenges, requiring (1) more effective translation of basic scientific knowledge to clinical application; (2) critical appraisal of rapidly moving scientific areas to guide investment where clinical need is greatest, not only where commercial opportunity is currently perceived; and (3) more specific information about sources and uses of research funds than is generally available to allow informed investment decisions. Responsibility falls on industry, government, and foundations to bring these changes about with a longer-term view of research value.","Moses, Hamilton; Dorsey, E Ray; Matheson, David H M; Thier, Samuel O",JAMA,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16174691/,472
196372,Teaching and Learning.,1955,"OBJECTIVES Nitric oxide inhibits the expression of many genes involved in inflammatory diseases. Glucocorticoids inhibit similar transcription factors. We hypothesized that there may be an interaction between nitric oxide and glucocorticoids, with the potential to enhance the anti-inflammatory effect when administered simultaneously. DESIGN Prospective, randomized, controlled study. SETTING Animal research laboratory. SUBJECTS A total of 45 anesthetized and mechanically ventilated pigs. INTERVENTIONS Lung and systemic injury was induced by intravenous infusion of endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide) for 6 hrs. After 2.5 hrs, one group received 3.5 mg/kg hydrocortisone, another group inhaled nitric oxide (30 ppm), and still another group received both steroid and nitric oxide. Control groups of healthy and endotoxin-exposed piglets were also studied. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Central hemodynamics and gas exchange were measured. Detection of the glucocorticoid receptor and inflammatory markers in lung, liver, and kidney tissue were made by immunohistochemistry, and morphology was studied with light microscopy. Endotoxin infusion markedly reduced glucocorticoid receptor expression in lung, liver, and kidney and up-regulated activator protein-1 and the inflammatory markers nuclear factor-kappaB and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. When administered separately, steroids and nitric oxide had modest effect on the inflammatory response. However, nitric oxide up-regulated the glucocorticoid receptor expression. Simultaneous administration of steroids and nitric oxide attenuated the inflammatory response and almost preserved or restored normal histology of both lung and systemic organs. When the glucocorticoid receptor was blocked by a receptor antagonist (mifepristone, 600 mg) and inhaled nitric oxide was subsequently administered, no increase in the expression of the glucocorticoid receptor was seen. CONCLUSION We suggest that up-regulation of glucocorticoid receptor expression by nitric oxide made steroid therapy more effective.","Da, Jiping; Chen, Luni; Hedenstierna, Göran",Critical care medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17095945/,472

These mRNAs all contain a common leader sequence which is derived from the 5' end of the genome. Subgenomic mRNA transcription and genome replication are directed by the viral replicase, which is expressed in the form of two polyproteins and subsequently processed into smaller nonstructural proteins (nsps). During the recent construction of an EAV infectious cDNA clone (pEAV030 [L. C. van Dinten, J. A. den Boon, A. L. M. Wassenaar, W. J. M. Spaan, and E. J. Snijder, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 94:991-996, 1997]), a mutant cDNA clone (pEAV030F) which carries a single replicase point mutation was obtained. This substitution (Ser-2429-->Pro) is located in the nsp10 subunit and renders the EAV030F virus deficient in subgenomic mRNA synthesis. To obtain more insight into the role of nsp10 in transcription and the nature of the transcriptional defect, we have now analyzed the EAV030F mutant in considerable detail. The Ser-2429-->Pro mutation does not affect the proteolytic processing of the replicase but apparently affects the function of nsp10 in transcription. Furthermore, our study showed that EAV030F still produces subgenomic positive and negative strands, albeit at a very low level. Both subgenomic positive-strand synthesis and negative-strand synthesis are equally affected by the Ser-2429-->Pro mutation, suggesting that nsp10 plays an important role in an early step of EAV mRNA transcription.","van Marle, G; van Dinten, L C; Spaan, W J; Luytjes, W; Snijder, E J",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10364273/,472

203277,Hacia una nueva cosmovisión epidemiológica./ Hacia una nueva cosmovisión epidemiológica./ Towards a new epidemiological worldview,2020,"In compressed sensing the goal is to recover a signal from as few as possible noisy, linear measurements. The general assumption is that the signal has only a few non-zero entries. Given an estimate for the noise level a common convex approach to recover the signal is basis pursuit denoising (BPDN). If the measurement matrix has the robust null space property with respect to the $\ell_2$-norm, BPDN obeys stable and robust recovery guarantees. In the case of unknown noise levels, nonnegative least squares recovers non-negative signals if the measurement matrix fulfills an additional property (sometimes called the $M^+$-criterion). However, if the measurement matrix is the biadjacency matrix of a random left regular bipartite graph it obeys with a high probability the null space property with respect to the $\ell_1$-norm with optimal parameters. Therefore, we discuss non-negative least absolute deviation (NNLAD). For these measurement matrices, we prove a uniform, stable and robust recovery guarantee. Such guarantees are important, since binary expander matrices are sparse and thus allow for fast sketching and recovery.

Lastly, we explain how the NNLAD can be used for group testing in the recent COVID-19 crisis and why contamination of specimens may be modeled as peaky noise, which favors $\ell_1$ based data fidelity terms.","Petersen, Hendrik Bernd; Bah, Bubacarr; Jung, Peter",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.13092v1.pdf,472
203403,Fake News Detection in Social Media using Graph Neural Networks and NLP Techniques: A COVID-19 Use-case,2020-11-30,"BackgroundA large cluster of 59 cases were linked to a single flight with 146 passengers from New Delhi to Hong Kong in April 2021. This outbreak coincided with early reports of exponential pandemic growth in New Delhi, which reached a peak of >400,000 newly confirmed cases on 7 May 2021. MethodsEpidemiological information including date of symptom onset, date of positive-sample detection, and travel and contact history for individual cases from this flight were collected. Whole genome sequencing was performed, and sequences were classified based on the dynamic Pango nomenclature system. Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic analysis compared sequences from this flight alongside other cases imported from India to Hong Kong on 26 flights between June 2020 and April 2021, as well as sequences from India or associated with India-related travel from February to April 2021, and 1,217 reference sequences. ResultsSequence analysis identified six lineages of SARS-CoV-2 belonging to two variants of concern (Alpha and Delta) and one variant of public health interest (Kappa) involved in this outbreak. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed at least three independent sub-lineages of Alpha with limited onward transmission, a superspreading event comprising 37 cases of Kappa, and transmission of Delta to only one passenger. Additional analysis of another 26 flights from India to Hong Kong confirmed widespread circulation of all three variants in India since early March 2021. ConclusionsThe broad spectrum of disease severity and long incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 pose a challenge for surveillance and control. As illustrated by this particular outbreak, opportunistic infections of SARS-CoV-2 can occur irrespective of variant lineage, and requiring a nucleic acid test within 72 hours of departure may be insufficient to prevent importation or in-flight transmission.","Dhanasekaran, Vijaykrishna; Edwards, Kimberly M; Xie, Ruopeng; Gu, Haogao; Adam, Dillon C; Chang, Lydia DJ; Cheuk, Sammi SY; Gurung, Shreya; Krishnan, Pavithra; Ng, Daisy YM; Liu, Gigi YZ; Wan, Carrie KC; Cheng, Samuel SM; Tsang, Dominic NC; Cowling, Benjamin J; Peiris, Malik; Poon, Leo LM",,,472
203736,On Upholding Academic Integrity in Online Examinations,2020,"High-throughput screening (HTS) is a well-established approach for tumor-specific drug development because of its high efficiency and customizable selection of antineoplastic drugs. However, there is still a lack of an appropriate cell-based HTS specific for migratory cancer cells. In the study presented here, we created a novel assay (mHTS): a single-cell-level screening method targeting migratory cancer cells and can be applied in a high-throughput manner. This mHTS platform is based on microchannel devices (providing physical confinement during cell migration and limit migrating cells' proliferation rate) assembled 96-well plate (fitting to HTS manner). To determine the feasibility of this assay, we quantified the anti-migratory and anti-viability effects of several molecules (Cytochalasin D, Doxorubicin and AZD-6244) on migrating (creeping inside microchannel) glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cells. After analyzing migration screening data that was collected on a single-cell-level, we were able to compare those drug's effects on cancer cells' migration velocity and uncovered the migration inhibiting potential of AZD (500nM and 1000nM). Viability data based on single-cell-level screening also allowed us to further understand the same drug's different lethality toward migrating and normal 2D cultured cancer cells. The Pre-classification of subpopulations enables us to study the heterogeneity of cancer and ensures our method's feasibility for a high-throughput manner. All these results proved our mHTS platform is suitable for single-cell-level anti-migration drug screening and has potential feasibility in promoting the development of anti-migratory-cancer-drug in a high-throughput manner.","Shen, Qionghua; Niederstrasser, Hanspeter; Barakat, Rami; Haddadin, Zaid Basem; Miller, Sandra Rose; Posner, Bruce; Kim, Young-Tae",Biofabrication (Online),,472

206066,Tips and Tools for Teaching Organic Synthesis Online,2020,"Epidemiological studies have revealed the emergence of multiple severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants of concern (VOC), including the lineage B.1.1.7 that is rapidly replacing old variants. The B.1.1.7 variant has been linked to increased morbidity rates, transmissibility, and potentially mortality. To assess viral fitness in vivo and to address whether the B.1.1.7 variant is capable of immune escape, we conducted infection and reinfection studies in naive and convalescent Syrian hamsters (>10 months old). Nasal wash samples from hamsters infected by a B.1.1.7 variant exhibited slightly higher viral RNA levels but lower infectious titers than those from B.1 (G614) variant-infected hamsters, and the two variants induced comparable lung pathologies in hamsters. Despite a sporadic and transient low-level infection in the nasal cavity, convalescent hamsters that had recovered from a previous USA-WA1 isolate (D614) infection displayed no observable clinical signs or lung pathology following B.1.1.7 rechallenge. Altogether, our study did not find that the B.1.1.7 variant significantly differs from the B.1 variant in pathogenicity in Syrian hamsters and that a heterologous natural infection-induced immunity confers protection against a secondary challenge by the B1.1.7 variant. IMPORTANCE The rapid emergence of several variants of concern of SARS-CoV-2 calls for evaluations of viral fitness and pathogenicity in animal models in order to understand the mechanism of enhanced transmission and the possible increases in morbidity and mortality rates. Here, we demonstrated that immunity naturally acquired through a prior infection with the first-wave variant does confer nearly complete protection against the B.1.1.7 variant in Syrian hamsters upon reexposure. Strikingly, although the B.1.1.7 variant appears to replicate to a higher level in the nose than the ancestral B.1 variant, it does not induce more severe lung pathology in hamsters.","Nuñez, Ivette A; Lien, Christopher Z; Selvaraj, Prabhuanand; Stauft, Charles B; Liu, Shufeng; Starost, Matthew F; Wang, Tony T",mSphere,,472

Here we used PCR amplification and sequencing to characterize redondoviruses in nasal/throat swabs collected longitudinally from a cohort of 58 individuals working with animals in Vietnam. We additionally analyzed samples from animals to which redondovirus DNA-positive participants were exposed. Redondoviruses were detected in approximately 60% of study participants, including 33% (30/91) of samples collected during episodes of acute respiratory disease and in 50% (29/58) of baseline samples (with no respiratory symptoms). Vientovirus (73%; 24/33) was detected more frequently in samples than brisaviruses (27%; 9/33). In the 23 participants with at least 2 redondovirus-positive samples among their longitudinal samples, 10 (43.5%) had identical redondovirus replication-gene sequences detected (sampling duration: 35-132 days). We found no identical redondovirus replication genes in samples from different participants, and no redondoviruses were detected in 53 pooled nasal/throat swabs collected from domestic animals. Phylogenetic analysis described no large-scale geographical clustering between viruses from Vietnam, the US, Spain, and China, indicating that redondoviruses are highly genetically diverse and have a wide geographical distribution. Collectively, our study provides novel insights into the Redondoviridae family in humans, describing a high prevalence, potentially associated with chronic shedding in the respiratory tract with lack of evidence of zoonotic transmission from close animal contacts. The tropism and potential pathogenicity of this viral family remain to be determined.","Tu, Nguyen Thi Kha; Deng, Xutao; Hong, Nguyen Thi Thu; Ny, Nguyen Thi Han; Phuc, Tran My; Tam, Pham Thi Thanh; Han, Duong An; Ha, Luu Thi Thu; Thwaites, Guy; Doorn, H Rogier van; Virtala, Anna-Maija K; Delwart, Eric; Baker, Stephen; Vapalahti, Olli; Tan, Le Van",Viruses,,472

216116,Selection of virtual simulation products: making the right choice,2020,"The population-level case-fatality rate (CFR) associated with COVID-19 varies substantially, both across countries at any given time and within countries over time. We analyze the contribution of two key determinants of the variation in the observed CFR: the age-structure of diagnosed infection cases and age-specific case-fatality rates. We use data on diagnosed COVID-19 cases and death counts attributable to COVID-19 by age for China, Germany, Italy, South Korea, Spain, the United States, and New York City. We calculate the CFR for each population at the latest data point and also for Italy, Germany, Spain, and New York City over time. We use demographic decomposition to break the difference between CFRs into unique contributions arising from the age-structure of confirmed cases and the age-specific case-fatality. In late June 2020, CFRs varied from 2.2% in South Korea to 14.0% in Italy. The age-structure of detected cases often explains more than two-thirds of cross-country variation in the CFR. In Italy, the CFR increased from 4.2% to 14.0% between March 9 and June 30, 2020, and more than 90% of the change was due to increasing age-specific case-fatality rates. The importance of the age-structure of confirmed cases likely reflects several factors, including different testing regimes and differences in transmission trajectories; while increasing age-specific case-fatality rates in Italy could indicate other factors, such as the worsening health outcomes of those infected with COVID-19. Our findings lend support to recommendations for data to be disaggregated by age, and potentially other variables, to facilitate a better understanding of population-level differences in CFRs. They also show the need for well-designed seroprevalence studies to ascertain the extent to which differences in testing regimes drive differences in the age-structure of detected cases.","Dudel, Christian; Riffe, Tim; Acosta, Enrique; van Raalte, Alyson; Strozza, Cosmo; Myrskylä, Mikko",PLoS One,,472

OBJECTIVE: To describe the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in a series of patients scheduled for digestive endoscopy at the Hospital Santa Caterina. Salt. (Girona). METHODS: Descriptive study of a series of cases of patients scheduled for endoscopy during the month of May 2020, when endoscopic activity was resumed after the peak of the pandemic, following SCD, SEED, AEG and ESGE recommendations. We examined nasopharyngeal samples 48-72 hours before the appointment, by RT-PCR, in all patients. RNA extraction was performed using the kits: Qiagen®-adapted, BiosSprint®96-DNA-Blood-Kit (384). For amplification-detection of SARS-CoV-2, methods recommended by the WHO and the CDC were followed. RESULTS: 110 asymptomatic patients without close contact with a positive case in the previous 14 days were scheduled; 105 (96.4%) were negative and five (4.5%) were positive. Two patients developed respiratory symptoms after diagnosis (presymptomatic) and three remained asymptomatic. Allfive5 patients were autochthonous cases with no history of travel or residence in another city or country associated with high prevalence of infection. Four cases were women aged 60-81 years. The N gene was detected in all cases. CONCLUSIONS: A high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was detected in patients scheduled for digestive endoscopy.

In addition, impact of lockdown on relationship with the partner and mental health was evaluated. Materials and Methods: An online survey was conducted using changes in sexual functioning questionnaire, Patient Health Questionnaire-4, and a self-designed questionnaire. Results: The mean age of the participants was 41.5 (standard deviation: 11.2;range: 22-77;median: 39.5) years, with the majority being males 385 (85.6%). The participants reported that lockdown led to reduction in the frequency of sexual intercourse and also touching the partner (fondling, caressing, touching, or kissing) when not indulging in sexual intercourse. Majority of the participants reported improvement in the overall relationship, communication with the partner, and interpersonal conflicts. About two-fifths of the participants reported engaging in sexual intercourse more than twice a week or more. About one-fifth screened positive for psychiatric morbidity, with 14.2% screened positive for anxiety, 14.8% screened positive for depression and 8.7% screened positive for both. In both genders, presence of depression and anxiety were associated with lower sexual functioning in all the domains. Conclusion: Lockdown led to a reduction in the frequency of sexual intercourse, and reduction in the frequency of intimacy in the form of fondling, caressing, touching, or kissing partner when not doing sexual intercourse. However, lockdown led to the improvement in overall relationship and communication with the partners and a reduction in interpersonal conflicts. © 2021 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

217258,Sustainability and air freight transportation: Lessons from the global pandemic,2021,"PURPOSE: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has had a profound impact on cancer care in the US Guidelines focused on the management of COVID-19, rather than healthcare needs of breast cancer patients requiring access to crucial services. This US survey of breast cancer survivors characterizes treatment delays early period in the pandemic. METHODS: We developed a survey and administered it to 609 adult breast cancer survivors in the US. We used snowball sampling with invitations distributed via social media. We used logistic regression to select a model of delay from a pool of independent variables including race, cancer stage, site of care, health insurance, and age. We used descriptive statistics to characterize delay types. RESULTS: Forty-four percent of participants reported cancer care treatment delays during the pandemic. Delays in all aspects of cancer care and treatment were reported. The only variable which had a significant effect was age (97 (.95, 99), p < 0.001) with younger respondents (M = 45.94, SD = 10.31) reporting a higher incidence of delays than older respondents (M = 48.98, SD = 11.10). There was no significant effect for race, insurance, site of care, or cancer stage. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings reveal a pervasive impact of COVID-19 on breast cancer care and a gap in disaster preparedness that leaves cancer survivors at risk for poor outcomes. Delays are critical to capture and characterize to help cancer providers and healthcare systems develop effective and patient-tailored processes and strategies to manage cases during the current pandemic wave, subsequent waves, and future disasters.","Papautsky, Elizabeth Lerner; Hamlish, Tamara",Breast Cancer Res Treat,,472

219585,COVID-19: Forecasting confirmed cases and deaths with a simple time-series model,2020,"The debate around the COVID-19 response in Africa has mostly focused on effects and implications of public health measures, in light of the socio-economic peculiarities of the continent. However, there has been limited exploration of the impact of differences in epidemiology of key comorbidities, and related healthcare factors, on the course and parameters of the pandemic. We summarise what is known about (a) the pathophysiological processes underlying the interaction of coinfections and comorbidities in shaping prognosis of COVID-19 patients, (b) the epidemiology of key coinfections and comorbidities, and the state of related healthcare infrastructure that might shape the course of the pandemic, and (c) implications of (a) and (b) for pandemic management and post-pandemic priorities. There is a critical need to generate empirical data on clinical profiles and the predictors of morbidity and mortality from COVID-19. Improved protocols for acute febrile illness and access to diagnostic facilities, not just for SARS-CoV-2 but also other viral infections, are of urgent importance. The role of malaria, HIV/TB and chronic malnutrition on pandemic dynamics should be further investigated. Although chronic non-communicable diseases account for a relatively lighter burden, they have a significant effect on COVID-19 prognosis, and the fragility of care delivery systems implies that adjustments to clinical procedures and re-organisation of care delivery that have been useful in other regions are unlikely to be feasible. Africa is a large region with local variations in factors that can shape pandemic dynamics. A one-size-fits-all response is not optimal, but there are broad lessons relating to differences in epidemiology and healthcare delivery factors, that should be considered as part of a regional COVID-19 response framework.","Anjorin, A A; Abioye, A I; Asowata, O E; Soipe, A; Kazeem, M I; Adesanya, I O; Raji, M A; Adesanya, M; Oke, F A; Lawal, F J; Kasali, B A; Omotayo, M O",Trop. med. int. health,,472

This shall unleash the full potential of intelligent IoT in a plethora of exciting applications, such as self-driving cars, unmanned aerial vehicles, healthcare, robotics, and supply chain finance. These applications drive the need of developing revolutionary computation, communication and artificial intelligence technologies that can make low-latency decisions with massive real-time data. To this end, federated machine learning, as a disruptive technology, is emerged to distill intelligence from the data at network edge, while guaranteeing device privacy and data security. However, the limited communication bandwidth is a key bottleneck of model aggregation for federated machine learning over radio channels. In this article, we shall develop an over-the-air computation based communication-efficient federated machine learning framework for intelligent IoT networks via exploiting the waveform superposition property of a multi-access channel. Reconfigurable intelligent surface is further leveraged to reduce the model aggregation error via enhancing the signal strength by reconfiguring the wireless propagation environments.","Yang, Kai; Shi, Yuanming; Zhou, Yong; Yang, Zhanpeng; Fu, Liqun; Chen, Wei",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.05843v1.pdf,472
220189,SKADAR LAKE CULTURAL LANDSCAPE AND ARCHITECTURAL HERITAGE Potential for the Development of Fisheries and Rural Tourism,2021,"OBJECTIVES: To reveal the mechanisms behind the dual effects of Crataegus aronia (C. aronia) aqueous extract on platelet aggregation by focusing on function, regulation, expression, and signaling of platelets P2Y12 receptors. METHODS: Adult male Wistar rats (120 ± 10 g) were classified as control received the vehicle, C. aronia (200 mg/kg), and C. aronia (2,000 mg/kg)-treated rats. After treatments for consecutive 7 days, hematological and molecular experiments were conducted to detect alterations in platelet aggregation, thromboxane B2 (THXB2) and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) content; protein levels of P2Y12, p-Akt, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), phosphorylated vasodilator-stimulated-phosphoprotein (p-VASP), nuclear factor &#954;B (NF-&#954;B), P-selectin, and etc. in platelets were determined by Western blot; mRNA expressions of P2Y12 and some inflammatory markers were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: At a concentration of 200 mg/kg, C. aronia inhibited platelet aggregation through multiple interconnected mechanisms including downregulation P2Y12 synthesis and expression, stimulating intracellular cAMP levels and protein levels of p-VASP, inhibiting platelets THXB2 release and protein levels of P-selectin. Also, it inhibited platelets level of ROS and of NF-&#954;B, a major signaling pathway that stimulates the expression of P2Y12 and THXA2 synthesis. Opposite findings were seen in platelets of rats received C. aronia at a concentration of 2,000 mg/kg. Interestingly, co-administration of N-acetylcysteine prevented all hematological and molecular alterations exerted by the high dose of the extract and inhibited platelet aggregation. CONCLUSION: Oral administration of C. aronia at low dose inhibits platelet aggregation by reducing THXB2 release, expression of P-selectin and activating cAMP and Akt signaling through two major mechanisms including downregulation of P2Y12 and inhibition of ROS-induced activation of NF-&#954;B, an effect that is observed to be in the opposite direction with its high dose.","Shatoor, Abdullah S; Shati, Ali; Humayed, S Al; Al-Qahtani, Sultan; Alkhateeb, Mahmoud",Chinese Journal of Integrative Medicine,,472

222059,Levers of control for supply chain sustainability: Control and governance mechanisms in a cross-boundary setting,2020,"OBJECTIVE: In December 2019 a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that is causing the current COVID-19 pandemic was identified in Wuhan, China. Many questions have been raised about its origin and adaptation to humans. In the present work we performed a genetic analysis of the Spike glycoprotein (S) of SARS-CoV-2 and other related coronaviruses (CoVs) isolated from different hosts in order to trace the evolutionary history of this protein and the adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 to humans. RESULTS: Based on the sequence analysis of the S gene, we suggest that the origin of SARS-CoV-2 is the result of recombination events between bat and pangolin CoVs. The hybrid SARS-CoV-2 ancestor jumped to humans and has been maintained by natural selection. Although the S protein of RaTG13 bat CoV has a high nucleotide identity with the S protein of SARS-CoV-2, the phylogenetic tree and the haplotype network suggest a non-direct parental relationship between these CoVs. Moreover, it is likely that the basic function of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S protein was acquired by the SARS-CoV-2 from the MP789 pangolin CoV by recombination and it has been highly conserved.","Flores-Alanis, Alejandro; Sandner-Miranda, Luisa; Delgado, Gabriela; Cravioto, Alejandro; Morales-Espinosa, Rosario",BMC Res Notes,,472

These priorities are challenging both public and private sector research groups around the world and have shone a spotlight on both existing bottlenecks in the research workflows involved as well as on the implications of having to do much of this work remotely because of enforced social distancing and lockdown measures. The ability to respond quickly to rapidly evolving events, coupled with an emerging understanding of the disease and its pathology, as well as different mutations of the virus, necessitates a highly flexible liquid-handling automation solution that is amenable to rapid switching between different assay workflows and processes to be exploited tactically as needed. In addition, the use of cloud-based software imparts a unique benefit in enabling multiple research groups and remote technical staff around the world to have ready access to the same protocols in real-time without delays, down to the required level of detail, sharing methods and data (for example, in faster clinical trials). Informed by a recent use case, this article explores these issues alongside the recent development and deployment of an automation solution, whose unique approach in terms of both its cloud-native software and its highly modular hardware aligns especially well with achieving the challenge set by this new frontier in the bioanalytical laboratory.","Zucchelli, Piero; Horak, Giorgio; Skinner, Nigel",SLAS Technol,,472

Placement of the implantable cardiac-defibrillator (ICD) lead in the middle cardiac vein (MCV) can be a viable option in these patients who have an indication for biventricular (BiV) ICD. We aim to describe the case of two patients with MCV lead placement and provide a comprehensive review of patients with complex TV pathology and indications for RV lead placement. METHODS AND RESULTS: We describe the cases of two patients with TV pathology unsuitable for the standard transvenous or surgical RV lead placement and undergoing BiV ICD implantation. Their characteristics, procedure, and outcomes are summarized. The BiV ICD was successfully placed with the RV lead positioned in the MCV in both patients. The procedures had no complications and were well-tolerated. On follow-up, both patients had appropriate tachytherapy with no readmissions for heart failure or worsening of cardiac function. CONCLUSION: Right ventricular lead placement of BiV ICD in the MCV can be an excellent alternative in patients with significant TV pathology and poor surgical candidacy.","Maskoun, Waddah; Raad, Mohamad; Khan, Arfaat; Mando, Ramy; Homsi, Mohamed",Europace,,472

This has lead to a collapse of substantial parts of the economy. Carriers of the disease are infectious roughly 3 days after exposure to the virus. First symptoms occur later or not at all. As a consequence tracing the contacts of people identified as carriers is essential for controlling the pandemic. This tracing must work everywhere, in particular indoors, where people are closest to each other. Furthermore, it should respect people's privacy. The present paper presents a method to enable a thorough traceability with very little risk on privacy.

From relatively casual meetings that may have taken place among co-workers in the office, through to the staging of full conference events, online platforms have essentially come to the rescue when in-person gatherings were no longer an option. There has been a significant uptake of online meeting platforms for everything from casual meetings to full conference events. In many cases, this has been driven by a rapid transition to home working. However, with a significant number of people becoming first-time users, it caught a user population that was unprepared and unaware of what good security looked like.

228416,Impact of Online Education on Anatomy Test Results,2021,"ObjectiveTo compare gut microbiome diversity and composition in SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed positive patients whose symptoms ranged from asymptomatic to severe versus PCR-negative exposed controls. DesignUsing a cross-sectional study design, we used shotgun next-generation sequencing (NGS) to evaluate microbiome composition and diversity in both patients with SARS-CoV-2 PCR-confirmed infections presenting to Ventura Clinical Trials for care from March 2020 through January 2021 and SARS-CoV-2 PCR-negative exposed controls. Patients were classified as being asymptomatic or having mild, moderate, or severe symptoms based on NIH criteria.1 Exposed controls were individuals with prolonged or repeated close contact with patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection or their samples, e.g. household members of patients or frontline healthcare workers. Microbiome diversity and composition were compared between patients and exposed controls and across patient subgroups at all taxonomic levels. ResultsThere were 52 patients and 20 controls. Compared with controls, patients had significantly less bacterial diversity, a lower abundance of Bifidobacterium and Faecalibacterium as well as some other bacteria, and a higher abundance of Bacteroides at the genus level. Additionally, there was an inverse association between disease severity and both bacterial diversity and Bifidobacterium and Faecalibacterium abundance. ConclusionWe hypothesize that low bacterial diversity and depletion of Bifidobacterium and Faecalibacterium genera either before or after infection led to reduced pro-immune function, thereby allowing SARS-CoV-2 infection to become symptomatic. This particular dysbiosis pattern may be a susceptibility marker for severe symptoms from SARS-CoV-2 infection and may be amenable to pre-, intra-, or post infection intervention.

METHODS: In this retrospective observational study, patients admitted to a single tertiary care center from April 1 to July 20, 2020, who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and developed acute abdominal pain or decreasing hemoglobin levels over the course of hospitalization were included. Abdominal CTA/CTV imaging studies performed in these patients were reviewed, and acute hemorrhagic or thromboembolic findings were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 40 patients (mean age, 59.7 years; 20 men, 20 women) were evaluated. Twenty-five patients (62.5%) required intensive care unit (ICU) admission and 15 patients (37.5%) were treated in the medical ward. Hemorrhagic complications were detected in 19 patients (47.5%), the most common was intramuscular hematoma diagnosed in 17 patients; It involved the iliopsoas compartment unilaterally in 10 patients, bilaterally in 2 patients and the rectus sheath in 5 cases. Pelvic extraperitoneal hemorrhage was found in 3 patients, and mesenteric hematoma in one patient. Thromboembolic events were diagnosed in 8 patients (20%) including; arterial thrombosis (n = 2), venous thrombosis (n = 2), splenic infarct (n = 1), bowel ischemia (n = 1) and multiple sites of thromboembolism (n = 2). CONCLUSION: Our study highlights that both hemorrhagic and thromboembolic complications can be seen in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. It is important that radiologists maintain a high index of suspicion for early diagnosis of these complications.","Abdelmohsen, Mohsen Ahmed; Alkandari, Buthaina M; Abdel Razek, Ahmed Abdel Khalek; Tobar, Ahmed Mohamed; Gupta, Vikash K; Elsebaie, Nermeen",Clin Imaging,,472

We aimed to assess the risk of COVID-19 infection, COVID-19-associated hospitalization, and mortality among Israeli patients with psoriasis treated by TNFi relative to other systemic agents. A population-based cohort study was conducted to compare psoriasis patients treated by TNFi (n=1,943), with those treated by methotrexate (n=1,929), ustekinumab (n=348), and acitretin (n=1,892) regarding COVID-19 outcomes. Risk of investigated outcomes was assessed using uni- and multi-variate Cox regression analyses. The incidence rate of COVID-19, COVID-19-associated hospitalization, and mortality in the TNFi group was 35.8 (95% CI, 26.1-47.9), 0.8 (95% CI, 0.0-4.2), and 0.0 per 1,000 person-years, respectively. Exposure to TNFi was associated with a comparable risk of COVID-19 infection [adjusted hazard ration (HR) for TNFi vs. methotrexate: 1.07 (95% CI, 0.67-1.71); TNFi vs. ustekinumab: 1.07 (95% CI, 0.48-2.40); TNFi vs. acitretin: 0.98 (95% CI, 0.61-1.57)]. TNFi was associated with a decreased risk of COVID-19-associated hospitalization relative to methotrexate (adjusted HR, 0.10; 95% CI, 0.01-0.82) and ustekinumab (adjusted HR, 0.04; 95% CI, 0.00-0.64), but not to acitretin (adjusted HR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.16-6.16). No significant difference in COVID-19-associated mortality was found between the four different groups. TNFi was associated with a decreased risk of admissions due to COVID-19.

Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 have been reported, but the relationships between laboratory features and viral load has not been comprehensively described. METHODS: Adult inpatients (&#8805;18 years old) with COVID-19 who underwent multiple (&#8805;5 times) nucleic acid tests with nasal and pharyngeal swabs were recruited from Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, including general patients (n = 70), severe patients (n = 195), and critical patients (n = 43). Laboratory data, demographic data, and clinical data were extracted from electronic medical records. The fitted polynomial curve was used to explore the association between serial viral loads and illness severity. RESULTS: Viral load of SARS-CoV-2 peaked within the first few days (2-4 days) after admission, then decreased rapidly along with virus rebound under treatment. Critical patients had the highest viral loads, in contrast to the general patients showing the lowest viral loads. The viral loads were higher in sputum compared with nasal and pharyngeal swab (P = .026). The positive rate of respiratory tract samples was significantly higher than that of gastrointestinal tract samples (P < .001). The SARS-CoV-2 viral load was negatively correlated with portion parameters of blood routine and lymphocyte subsets and was positively associated with laboratory features of cardiovascular system. CONCLUSIONS: The serial viral loads of patients revealed whole viral shedding during hospitalization and the resurgence of virus during the treatment, which could be used for early warning of illness severity, thus improve antiviral interventions.","Huang, Jing-Tao; Ran, Ruo-Xi; Lv, Zhi-Hua; Feng, Li-Na; Ran, Chen-Yang; Tong, Yong-Qing; Li, Dong; Su, Han-Wen; Zhu, Cheng-Liang; Qiu, Shi-Li; Yang, Jie; Xiao, Meng-Yao; Liu, Ming-Jun; Yang, Yu-Ting; Liu, Song-Mei; Li, Yan",Clin Infect Dis,,472

234929,Sustainable development: Understanding the least resource base,2021,"Efficacy for COVID-19 treatments can be enhanced significantly through targeting the nasopharynx, which has been shown to be the dominant preliminary infection site for SARS-CoV-2. Although intranasal drugs can be administered easily through drops or sprays, it is difficult to test whether current protocols will deliver the right amount of the drug to this location consistently. We are interested in developing an in silico prototyping tool to rapidly identify optimal parameters for intranasal delivery. In this study, we have applied computational fluid dynamics to simulate fluid flow through the nasal cavity and examined particle deposition for a drug formulation, mimicking different delivery methods. The nasal geometry models were derived using digitized and meshed computed tomography (CT) scans of human patients. Using the nasal geometries, we simulated two different airflows: a laminar model at 15 LPM (Liters/min) that simulated resting breathing rate and a Large Eddy Simulation (LES) model used to achieve a higher flow rate of 30 LPM. We were able to run particle tracking simulations for these two airflow schemes to test different drug properties such as particle size. The different injection methods used include surface injection which best replicates an inhaler-based release of particle droplets into the nostril and the cone injection method which best replicates a spray into the nostril. The results of the study suggest that the most optimal drug particle size for targeting the intranasal infection sites is around 6-14 microns.","Lao, Yueying; Joseph-McCarthy, Diane; Chakravarty, Arijit; Balivada, Pallavi A.; Ato, Phoebe; Ka, Nogaye K.; Basu, Saikat",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.16325v1.pdf,472

MethodsBetween June and August 2020, an agent-based model was used to project rates of COVID-19 infection incidence and cases diagnosed as positive from 15 September to 31 October 2020 for 72 geographic settings. Five scenarios were modelled: a baseline scenario where no future changes were made to existing restrictions, and four scenarios representing small or moderate changes in restrictions at two intervals. Post hoc, upper and lower bounds for number of diagnosed Covid-19 cases were compared with actual data collected during the prediction window. A regression analysis with 17 covariates was performed to determine correlates of accurate projections. ResultsThe actual data fell within the lower and upper bounds in 27 settings and out of bounds in 45 settings. The only statistically significant predictor of actual data within the predicted bounds was correct assumptions about future policy changes (OR = 15.04; 95%CI 2.20-208.70; p=0.016). ConclusionsFor this study, the accuracy of COVID-19 model projections was dependent on whether assumptions about future policies are correct. Frequent changes in restrictions implemented by governments, which the modelling team was not always able to predict, in part explains why the majority of model projections were inaccurate compared with actual outcomes and supports revision of projections when policies are changed as well as the importance of policy experts collaborating on modelling projects.","Houdroge, Farah; Palmer, Anna; Delport, Dominic; Walsh, Tom; Kelly, Sherrie L; Hainsworth, Samuel W; Abeysuriya, Romesh G; Stuart, Robyn M; Kerr, Cliff C; Coplan, Paul; Wilson, David P; Scott, Nick",,,472

236441,Robotic Tool as Support in Teaching Processes During COVID 19 Pandemic,2021,"The contributions in this article are two-fold. First, we introduce a new hand-written digit data set that we collected. It contains high-resolution images of hand-written digits together with various writer characteristics which are not available in the well-known MNIST database. The data set is publicly available and is designed to create new research opportunities. Second, we perform a first analysis of this new data set. We begin with simple supervised tasks. We assess the predictability of the writer characteristics gathered, the effect of using some of those characteristics as predictors in classification task and the effect of higher resolution images on classification accuracy. We also explore semi-supervised applications; we can leverage the high quantity of hand-written digits data sets already existing online to improve the accuracy of various classifications task with noticeable success. Finally, we also demonstrate the generative perspective offered by this new data set; we are able to generate images that mimics the writing style of specific writers. The data set provides new research opportunities and our analysis establishes benchmarks and showcases some of the new opportunities made possible with this new data set.","Beaulac, C'edric; Rosenthal, Jeffrey S.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.07946v2.pdf,472
236500,Post-COVID 19 Tourism: Will Digital Tourism Replace Mass Tourism?,2021,"Many countries have enacted, or are in the process of enacting, emergency mental health legislation in response to the global pandemic of Covid-19 (coronavirus). In Ireland, the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act, 2020 amends the Mental Health Act 2001 to permit the Mental Health Commission to request an independent psychiatric report about an involuntary patient from any consultant psychiatrist who is not treating the patient (and not just those on its designated panel). This independent examination may occur 'in person', 'by other appropriate means', or even, 'due to the exigencies of the public health emergency', not occur at all, once this is explained in the resultant report. The 2020 Act acknowledges that 'the exigencies of the public health emergency' might hamper the independent psychiatrist's work and requires a written report from the patient's treating psychiatrist 'no earlier than the day before' the tribunal, in lieu of the psychiatrist physically attending a tribunal hearing, although, if possible, they will attend (i.e. phone in to) a tribunal held by conference call. The 2020 Act permits the Mental Health Commission to, if necessary, appoint tribunals 'consisting of one member who shall be a practising barrister or solicitor'. Such a tribunal shall, if possible, consult with a consultant psychiatrist if the reports from the independent psychiatrist and treating psychiatrist conflict or if it is otherwise 'necessary in the interest of the patient'. A tribunal can extend an involuntary order by a second period of 14 days 'of its own motion if the tribunal, having due regard to the interest of the patient, is satisfied that it is necessary'. Tribunals for current involuntary patients will be prioritised over retrospective tribunals for discharged patients; a tribunal can direct a witness to provide 'a written statement' rather than attending; and the patient can make written representation to the tribunal instead of physically attending a tribunal hearing, although they may attend (i.e. phone in to) a tribunal held by conference call. Psycho-surgery for involuntary patients is banned. While it is clear that revisions are urgent and necessary in light of Covid-19, the proportionality of these changes will depend on how, and the extent to which, they are used in practice. With good communication, efficient team-working and close adherence to professional codes of practice and ethics, it is hoped that these amendments will result in a review system that is as reasonable, robust and reassuring as the current, highly unusual circumstances permit.","Kelly, Brendan D",Int J Law Psychiatry,,472

The aim of the study was to analyse the relationship between eating habits, mental and emotional mood. A survey was conducted online during social isolation, from 24 April to 18 May 2020, among the Italian population. A total of 602 interviewees were included in the data analysis. A high percentage of respondents experienced a depressed mood, anxious feelings, hypochondria and insomnia (61.3%, 70.4%, 46.2% and 52.2%). Almost half of the respondents felt anxious due to the fact of their eating habits, consumed comfort food and were inclined to increase food intake to feel better. Age was inversely related to dietary control (OR = 0.971, p = 0.005). Females were more anxious and disposed to comfort food than males (p < 0.001; p < 0.001).

240713,A Brazilian pandemia/monium: A researcher search for a “New Normal”,2020,"The emerging and re-emerging viral diseases are continuous threats to the wellbeing of human life. Previous outbreaks of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS had evidenced potential threats of coronaviruses in human health. The recent pandemic due to SARS-CoV-2 is overwhelming and has been going beyond control. Vaccines and antiviral drugs are ungently required to mitigate the pandemic. Therefore, it is important to comprehend the mechanistic details of viral infection process. The fusion between host cell and virus being the first step of infection, understanding the fusion mechanism could provide crucial information to intervene the infection process. Interestingly, all enveloped viruses contain fusion protein on their envelope that acts as fusion machine. For coronaviruses, the spike or S glycoprotein mediates successful infection through receptor binding and cell fusion. The cell fusion process requires merging of virus and host cell membranes, and that is essentially performed by the S2 domain of the S glycoprotein. In this review, we have discussed cell fusion mechanism of SARS-CoV-1 from available atomic resolution structures and membrane binding of fusion peptides. We have further discussed about the cell fusion of SARS-CoV-2 in the context of present pandemic situation.","Chakraborty, Hirak; Bhattacharjya, Surajit",Biophys Chem,,472

Here, three commercially available assays with widespread distribution capabilities are compared. A total of 667 specimens, 103 from patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections and 564 collected prior to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, were analyzed in parallel using the Roche Elecsys SARS-CoV-2 Total Antibody and Abbott Alinity SARS-CoV-2 IgG assays; a subset of 55 samples from patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections was additionally evaluated using the Abbott Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgM assay. Qualitative percent agreement between the Abbott IgG and Roche total antibody assays was 98.7% (658/667), with Cohen's kappa 0.919 (95% CI 0.867-0.972). Qualitative percent agreement with the Abbott IgM assay was 92.7% (51/55, Abbott IgG) and 85.5% (47/55, Roche total antibody). Diagnostic specificities determined using pre-COVID-19 samples for the Abbott IgG and Roche total antibody assays were 99.65% (95% CI 98.72-99.90%) and 100.00% (95% CI 99.32-100.00%), respectively, spanning claims made by each manufacturer. Diagnostic sensitivities increased for all three assays with increasing time since the onset of symptoms. Among 51 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections, 23 (45.1%), 24 (47.1%), and 22 (43.1%) were reactive by the Abbott IgG, Roche total antibody, and Abbott IgM assays, respectively, with sampling times 0-56 days post-positive PCR (median/mean 2/6.2 days). Combining IgG and IgM screening identified 4/55 additional samples with detectable antibodies that would not have been observed using the assays independently. Notably, one immunocompromised patient with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection showed no detectable antibodies using any of the three assays 43 days after onset of symptoms.","Harley, Kellisha; Gunsolus, Ian",J. clin. microbiol,,472

241262,Application of the Zoom Meeting Application in Online Learning During the Pandemic (preprint),2021,"In this paper, we present a simple yet effective method (ABSGD) for addressing the data imbalance issue in deep learning. Our method is a simple modification to momentum SGD where we leverage an attentional mechanism to assign an individual importance weight to each gradient in the mini-batch. Unlike many existing heuristic-driven methods for tackling data imbalance, our method is grounded in {\it theoretically justified distributionally robust optimization (DRO)}, which is guaranteed to converge to a stationary point of an information-regularized DRO problem. The individual-level weight of a sampled data is systematically proportional to the exponential of a scaled loss value of the data, where the scaling factor is interpreted as the regularization parameter in the framework of information-regularized DRO. Compared with existing class-level weighting schemes, our method can capture the diversity between individual examples within each class. Compared with existing individual-level weighting methods using meta-learning that require three backward propagations for computing mini-batch stochastic gradients, our method is more efficient with only one backward propagation at each iteration as in standard deep learning methods. To balance between the learning of feature extraction layers and the learning of the classifier layer, we employ a two-stage method that uses SGD for pretraining followed by ABSGD for learning a robust classifier and finetuning lower layers. Our empirical studies on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","Qi, Qi; Xu, Yi; Jin, Rong; Yin, Wotao; Yang, Tianbao",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.06951v3.pdf,472

We aimed to estimate the cumulative attack rate of SARS-CoV-2 in hemodialysis patients in China using a serological test. Methods: We enrolled all hemodialysis patients from 8 hemodialysis facilities in Honghu and Jingzhou of Hubei province and Guangzhou and Foshan of Guangdong province in China. We screened these patients for SARS-CoV-2 infection by both a reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for viral RNA and a serological test for IgG and IgM antibodies. Data on demographics and clinical characteristics were collected via case report forms. We also enrolled the health care workers from the participating hospitals and compared the seropositive rate between hemodialysis patients and health care workers in the same region. Results: Among 1542 hemodialysis patients, 5 (0.32%) and 51 (3.3%) were tested positive by the RT-PCR test and the serological test, respectively. The seropositive rate in Hubei (3.6%) was higher than that in Guangdong (2.8%), although the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.5). Most of the seropositive patients were asymptomatic. Independent risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection were being older than 65 years, having manifestation of lung infection in imaging examinations, and having a lower level of serum albumin. In comparison, the seropositive rate in 3205 health care workers was 1.2%ï¼which was significantly lower than that observed in the hemodialysis patients (P < .001). Conclusion: The cumulative rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection in hemodialysis patients in China was high at 3.3%. Serological test detected 10 times more cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection than the RT-PCR test and should be the preferred tool for estimating the prevalence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).","Xu, Xin; Nie, Sheng; Sun, Jian; Kong, Yaozhong; Liang, Min; Li, Dongfeng; Ma, Tean; Peng, Jiaqing; Gao, Shikui; Shao, Yong; Zha, Yan; Peng, Gangyi; Ren, Chanjun; Huang, Ailong; Hou, Fan Fan",,,472

Results show that Twitter is first and foremost used as a news seeking and sharing platform with more than 70 % of the most diffused tweets being related to news and comments on crisis updates. As for the retweeting dynamics, our results show an almost immediate response from Twitter users, with some first retweets occurring as quickly as within 2 s and the vast majority ( 90 % ) of them done within 10 min. Nearly 86 % of the retweeting processes could have 75 % of their retweets finished within 24 h, indicating a 1-day information value of tweets. Distribution of retweeting behaviors could be modeled by Power law, Weibull, and Log normal in this study, but still there are 20 % original tweets whose retweeting distributions left unexplained. Results of retweeting community analysis show that following retweeters contribute to nearly 50 % of the retweets. In addition, the retweeting contribution of verified Twitter users is significantly ( P < 0.05 ) different from that of unverified users. A similar significant ( P < 0.05 ) difference is also found in their rates of verified retweeters, and it has been shown that verified Twitter users enjoy seven times as high value as that of unverified users. In other words, users with the same verification status are more likely to get together to diffuse crisis information.","Wang, Bairong; Liu, Bin; Zhang, Qi",Nat Hazards (Dordr),,472

The COVID-19 mRNA vaccines represent a new class of vaccine products, which consist of synthetic mRNA strands encoding the SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein, packaged in lipid nanoparticles to deliver mRNA to cells. This review digs deeper into the scientific breakthroughs of the last decades that laid the foundations for the rapid rise of mRNA vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic. As well as providing momentum for mRNA vaccines, SARS-CoV-2 represents an ideal case study allowing to compare design-activity differences between the different mRNA vaccine candidates. Therefore, a detailed overview of the composition and (pre)clinical performance of the three most advanced mRNA vaccines is provided and the influence of choices in their structural design on to their immunogenicity and reactogenicity profile is discussed in depth. In addition to the new fundamental insights in the mRNA vaccines' mode of action highlighted here, we also point out which unknowns remain that require further investigation and possibly, optimization in future mRNA vaccine development.","Verbeke, Rein; Lentacker, Ine; De Smedt, Stefaan C; Dewitte, Heleen",J Control Release,,472

246280,Cloud-based Integration and Standardization of Address Data for Disaster Management – a South African Case Study,2020,"SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, evades the human immune system by capping its RNA. This process protects the viral RNA and is essential for its replication. Multiple viral proteins are involved in this RNA capping process, including the nonstructural protein 16 (nsp16), which is an S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM)-dependent 2'-O-methyltransferase. Nsp16 is significantly active when in complex with another nonstructural protein, nsp10, which plays a key role in its stability and activity. Here we report the development of a fluorescence polarization (FP)-based RNA displacement assay for nsp10-nsp16 complex in a 384-well format with a Z' factor of 0.6, suitable for high-throughput screening. In this process, we purified the nsp10-nsp16 complex to higher than 95% purity and confirmed its binding to the methyl donor SAM, the product of the reaction, S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine (SAH), and a common methyltransferase inhibitor, sinefungin, using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). The assay was further validated by screening a library of 1124 drug-like compounds. This assay provides a cost-effective high-throughput method for screening the nsp10-nsp16 complex for RNA competitive inhibitors toward developing COVID-19 therapeutics.","Perveen, Sumera; Khalili Yazdi, Aliakbar; Devkota, Kanchan; Li, Fengling; Ghiabi, Pegah; Hajian, Taraneh; Loppnau, Peter; Bolotokova, Albina; Vedadi, Masoud",SLAS Discov,,472

248336,Social Distancing as p-Dispersion Problem,2020,"As physicians specializing in rehabilitation medicine consider sequelae from the novel coronavirus pandemic that began in 2019, one issue that should be top of mind is the physiologic effect that large-scale social distancing had on the health of patients in general but, more specifically, on preoperative patients who had their surgeries delayed or will have newly scheduled procedures during the peripandemic period. Predictably, as the virus becomes less prevalent, there will be a tremendous motivation to move forward with scheduling operations from both patient care and institutional perspectives. However, one can anticipate a pandemic-related increase in surgical morbidity and mortality above prepandemic levels, particularly in older or medically frail patients even if they did not have a novel coronavirus (i.e., COVID-19) infection. Therefore, now is the time to consider for patients awaiting surgery a wider adoption of prehabilitation-physical and psychological assessments that establish a baseline functional level, identify impairments, and provide interventions that promote physical and psychological health to reduce the incidence and/or severity of future impairments.","Silver, Julie K",Am J Phys Med Rehabil,,472

In multivariate analysis, advanced age was an independent risk factor for death. Recent studies suggest a role for the nucleotide-binding domain and leucine rich repeat containing family, pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation in lung inflammation and fibrosis in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infections. Increased NLRP3/ apoptosis-associated speck-like protein (ASC) mRNA expression and increased caspase-1 activity, have been observed in aged lung, provoking increased and heightened expression levels of mature Interleukin (IL)-1ß and IL-18 in aged individuals. Aged individuals have a basal predisposition to over-react to infection, displaying an increased hyper-inflammatory cascade, that seems not to be fully physiologically controlled. NLRP3 inflammasome is over-activated in aged individuals, through deficient mitochondrial functioning, increased mitochondrial Reactive Oxigen Species (mtROS) and/or mitochondrial (mt)DNA, leading to a hyper-response of classically activated macrophages and subsequent increases in IL-1 ß. This NLRP3 over-activated status in elderly individuals, is also observed in telomere dysfunctional mice models. In our opinion, the NLRP3 inflammasome plays a central role in the increased lethality observed in elderly patients infected by COVID-19. Strategies blocking inflammasome would deserve to be studied.","Lara, Pedro C; Macías-Verde, David; Burgos-Burgos, Javier",Aging Dis,,472

This research underscores the importance of providing options for accessing health care services and diagnostic testing in a clinically rigorous manner. Providing options for patients will be essential in curtailing the spread of COVID-19, and any concomitant confusion caused by the overlapping symptomology of the flu and other upper respiratory viruses. Methods: A survey was sent to patients to collect information related to their experience with testing, guidance, and consults in a telehealth model for SARS-CoV-2. Specifically, patients were asked where they would have sought testing and care had this model not been available, and their satisfaction level with the service itself. Results: More than 1,400 patients responded to the survey for a response rate of 15%. Results demonstrate that patients who underwent testing and received guidance/consults through this model would have visited other in-person clinical environments such as emergency rooms or urgent care centers. Although â¼70% of patients had never used telehealth services before, >90% were highly satisfied with their experience. Conclusion: Many health experts are predicting a second wave for COVID-19 infections around the country. Given the strong overlap of flu and other upper respiratory infections with COVID-19, the winter season could prove challenging both to contain the spread of the virus and to differentiate the cause.

250259,The theory and empirics of the structural reshaping of globalization,2020,"BACKGROUND: US nursing homes are required to follow Centers for Disease Control guidance for COVID-19 transmission-based precautions (TBP) when admitting COVID-positive patients. OBJECTIVE: To assess how frequently nursing homes had shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) or staffing in weeks when they admitted COVID-positive patients, which likely made it more difficult to follow TBP, and to compare facility characteristics by admissions practices. DESIGN AND SETTING: Facility-level data from the Nursing Home COVID-19 Public File for the period between June 7, 2020 and March 7, 2021 was combined with additional data. The percentages of nursing homes that admitted COVID-positive patients and that had shortages when admitting were calculated for each week. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression models were used to examine the relationship between facility characteristics and the likelihood of admitting COVID-positive patients. MEASUREMENTS: Facilities were categorized as having admitted COVID-positive patients in a week if one or more admissions requiring TBP were reported for that week. Facilities that reported having less than a 1-week supply of any type of PPE or being short any type of staff in a week were defined, respectively, as having a PPE shortage or staffing shortage in that week. RESULTS: Over the 40-week study period, 39% of US nursing homes admitted COVID-positive patients in at least 1 week in which they were experiencing PPE or staffing shortages. Facilities that admitted COVID-positive patients with shortages generally had lower Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services overall five-star ratings than other facilities. Only a small percentage of facilities that admitted COVID-positive patients while facing shortages were located in counties with severe shortages of PPE or staffing. In logistic regression models, shortages were not associated with COVID-positive admissions. CONCLUSION: The widespread practice of admitting COVID-positive patients while facing shortages may have put nursing home residents and staff at heightened risk of COVID-19 infection.","Gibson, Diane M; Greene, Jessica",J. am. geriatr. soc,,472
250563,Fake news reaching young people on social networks: Distrust challenging media literacy,2021,"Background: The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine has recently received emergency approval from the US FDA. The mRNA technology was used to manufacture the Pfizer vaccine;however, as a pioneering technology that has never been used in the manufacture of vaccines, many people have concerns about the vaccine's side effects. Thus, the current study aimed to track the short-term side effects of the vaccine. Methods: The information in this study was gathered by a Google Form-questionnaire (online survey). The results included the responses of 455 individuals, all of whom are Saudi Arabia inhabitants. Adverse effects of the vaccine were reported after the first and the second doses. Results: The most common symptoms were injection site pain, headaches, flu-like symptoms, fever, and tiredness. Less common side effects were a fast heartbeat, whole body aches, difficulty breathing, joint pain, chills, and drowsiness. Rare side effects include Bell's palsy and lymph nodes swelling and tenderness. Flu-like symptoms were more common among those under 60 years of age, while injection site pain was more frequent among recipients who were 60 years and older. The study revealed a significant increase in the number of females who suffered from the vaccine side effects compared to males. Difficulty of breathing was more reported among recipients who had been previously infected with the coronavirus compared to those who had not been previously infected. Conclusion: Most of the side effects reported in this study were consistent with Pfizer's fact sheet for recipients and caregivers. Further studies are required to determine the long-term side effects.","El-Shitany, N. A.; Harakeh, S.; Badr-Eldin, S. M.; Bagher, A. M.; Eid, B.; Almukadi, H.; Alghamdi, B. S.; Alahmadi, A.

250807,COVID-19: Accelerating Digital Transformation for University's Research Administration,2020,"An outbreak of atypical pneumonia, now called COVID-19 and known to be caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, first detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province of the People's Republic of China in December 2019 and afterwards rapidly spread worldwide. Wuhan and the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region implemented first-level public health emergency responses to stop the spread of the virus on January 23rd, 2020. We tracked the geographical gravity centre of the disease and calculated spatial autocorrelation to explore the spatiotemporal patterns of distribution of imported and locally disseminated COVID-19 cases under the emergency-response control measure. We also applied polynomial regression analysis to estimate the trend of the COVID-19 in the YRD region before and after the control activities against the spread of the infection were instituted. The results show that the control measures applied have been effective. And, in the YRD region, areas with a large influx of population flow from Wuhan and Hubei Province had high risks of COVID-19. Therefore, identification of the spatiotemporal trends should be the first step when developing effective policies to manage and control any new epidemic. The results are not only informative locally but also useful for the rest of the world.","Ye, Lei; Hu, Lingqian",Geospatial Health (Testo stamp.),,472

251280,Key Characteristics of a Fragile Healthcare Supply Chain: Learning from a Pandemic,2021,"Background: COVID-19 has been quickly spreading, making it a serious public health threat. It is important to identify phenotypes to predict the severity of disease and design an individualized treatment. Methods: We collected data from 213 COVID-19 patients in Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital from January 1 to March 30, 2020. Principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis were used to classify patients. Results: We identified three distinct subgroups of COVID-19. Cluster 1 was the largest group (52.6%) and characterized by oldest age, lowest cellular immune function, and albumin levels. 38.5% of subjects were grouped into Cluster 2. Most of the lab results in Cluster 2 fell between those of Clusters 1 and 3. Cluster 3 was the smallest cluster (8.9%), characterized by youngest age and highest cellular immune function. The incidence of respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), heart failure, and usage of non-invasive mechanical ventilation in Cluster 1 was significantly higher than others (P < 0.05). Cluster 1 had the highest death rate of 30.4% (P = 0.005). Although there were significant differences in age between Clusters 2 and 3 (P < 0.001), we found that there was no difference in demand for medical resources. Conclusions: We identified three distinct clusters of the COVID-19 patients. The results show that age alone could not be used to assess a patient's condition. Specifically, management of albumin, and immune function are important in reducing the severity of disease.","Ye, Wenjing; Lu, Weiwei; Tang, Yanping; Chen, Guoxi; Li, Xiaopan; Ji, Chen; Hou, Min; Zeng, Guangwang; Lan, Xing; Wang, Yaling; Deng, Xiaoqin; Cai, Yuyang; Huang, Hai; Yang, Ling",Front Med (Lausanne),,472

To strengthen caregiving and promote targeted care for older adults during and after the pandemic, this paper investigates the impact of the coronavirus on the economic activities and well-being of older adults in Enugu and Anambra states, Nigeria. Hermeneutic phenomenology was adopted and 16 older adults aged between 60 and 81 years, with a majority of them still working as farmers and traders were phone-interviewed. Findings highlighted four key lessons for gerontological social workers including 1) the fear that impact of the containment measures could kill the older adults faster than the virus; 2) the measures generate a feeling of neglect and marginalization of healthcare needs among older adults; 3) altered positive health-seeking behavior among the older adults; 4) and concern about the absence of functional policy and plan to address the welfare of older adults. Therefore, the central focus of the gerontological social workers and Nigerian polity should not be on how to reduce the spread of the disease alone, but on an application of caution in instituting and implementing the measures.","Agbawodikeizu, Patricia Uju; Ezulike, Chigozie Donatus; Ekoh, Prince Chiagozie; George, Elizabeth Onyedikachi; Okoye, Uzoma Odera; Nnebe, Ikechukwu",J Gerontol Soc Work,,472

Subsequent reductions in various anthropogenic activities have led to improved air quality during the lockdown. In this study, we apply a widely used exposure-response function to estimate the short-term health impacts associated with PM2.5 changes over the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region due to COVID-19 lockdown. Concentrations of PM2.5 during lockdown period reduced by 22.9% to 54.0% compared to pre-lockdown level. Estimated PM2.5-related daily premature mortality during lockdown period is 895 (95% confidential interval: 637-1081), which is 43.3% lower than pre-lockdown period and 46.5% lower compared with averages of 2017-2019. According to our calculation, total number of avoided premature death associated PM2.5 reduction during the lockdown is estimated to be 42.4 thousand over the YRD region, with Shanghai, Wenzhou, Suzhou (Jiangsu province), Nanjing, and Nantong being the top five cities with largest health benefits. Avoided premature mortality is mostly contributed by reduced death associated with stroke (16.9 thousand, accounting for 40.0%), ischemic heart disease (14.0 thousand, 33.2%) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (7.6 thousand, 18.0%). Our calculations do not support or advocate any idea that pandemics produce a positive note to community health. We simply present health benefits from air pollution improvement due to large emission reductions from lowered human and industrial activities. Our results show that continuous efforts to improve air quality are essential to protect public health, especially over city-clusters with dense population.","Huang, Ling; Liu, Ziyi; Li, Hongli; Wang, Yangjun; Li, Yumin; Zhu, Yonghui; Ooi, Maggie Chel Gee; An, Jing; Shang, Yu; Zhang, Dongping; Chan, Andy; Li, Li",Geohealth,,472

On the day of the lockdown announcement, YouGov ran a survey that captured responses before and after the announcement. Comparison of these responses suggests that the lockdown announcement made people more supportive of the government's response to the crisis but also (perhaps surprisingly) more concerned about the pandemic. Analysis of heterogeneous treatment effects suggests that the announcement narrowed gaps in perceptions of the crisis, increasing support for the government's response especially among those who had been least supportive and increasing concern about the pandemic especially among those who had been least concerned. Overall, the findings highlight a tension inherent in governing during times of crisis: actions that increase people's confidence in government and induce compliance with government directives may also tend to increase anxiety among the population.

This study aimed to investigate people's psychological and behavioural responses to the COVID-19 epidemic and explore the predictors for social distancing and panic buying. Methods: A 17-item questionnaire was developed and distributed randomly to people using social media. Descriptive statistics and one-way ANOVA were used to assess people's psychological and behavioural responses. Hierarchical regression was conducted to investigate the predictive effects of psychological and behavioural variables on reports of social distancing and panic buying respectively. Results: Respondents reported a low degree of risk perception and risk beliefs with regard to being outside, and had moderate psychological stress and positive safeguarding behaviours for being outside. Respondents reported high concern regarding COVID-19 and tended to keep social distancing during the epidemic. They would panic-purchase food and supplies. In addition, psychological stress emerged as a very strong predictor for reporting COVID-19 concerns and panic buying. Furthermore, reported concerns about COVID-19 information sharing had a significant predictive influence on panic buying of food. Safeguarding behaviours for being outside had a significant predictive effect on respondents reported social distancing of cancelling outings. Reported concerns about COVID-19 were stronger predictors for reported social distancing. Conclusion: It is important to relieve people's psychological stress and manage information sharing to control panic buying. In addition, we should promote adoption of safeguarding behaviours for being outside and emphasise the concerns with regard to COVID-19 to encourage people keep social distancing. Measures should be implemented according to the characteristics of the population.","Zhang, Yaping; Zhou, Ronggang",Z Gesundh Wiss,,472

256067,Changes in air quality during the COVID-19 lockdown in singapore and associations with human mobility trends,2020,"Given the speed of viral infection spread, repurposing of existing drugs has been given the highest priority in combating the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Only drugs that are already registered or close to registration, and therefore have passed lengthy safety assessments, have a chance to be tested in clinical trials and reach patients quickly enough to help in the current disease outbreak. Here, we have reviewed available evidence and possible ways forward to identify already existing pharmaceuticals displaying modest broad-spectrum antiviral activity which is likely linked to their high accumulation in cells. Several well studied examples indicate that these drugs accumulate in lysosomes, endosomes and biological membranes in general, and thereby interfere with endosomal pathway and intracellular membrane trafficking crucial for viral infection. With the aim to identify other lysosomotropic drugs with possible inherent antiviral activity, we have applied a set of clear physicochemical, pharmacokinetic and molecular criteria on 530 existing drugs. In addition to publicly available data, we have also used our in silico model for the prediction of accumulation in lysosomes and endosomes. By this approach we have identified 36 compounds with possible antiviral effects, also against coronaviruses. For 14 of them evidence of broad-spectrum antiviral activity has already been reported, adding support to the value of this approach. Presented pros and cons, knowledge gaps and methods to identify lysosomotropic antivirals, can help in the evaluation of many drugs currently in clinical trials considered for repurposing to target COVID-19, as well as open doors to finding more potent and safer alternatives.","Norinder, Ulf; Tuck, Astrud; Norgren, Kalle; Munic Kos, Vesna",Biomed Pharmacother,,472
257506,A sectoral approach allows an artful merger of climate and trade policy,2020,"BACKGROUND: Psychological stress and coping experienced during pregnancy can have important effects on maternal and infant health, which can also vary by race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. Therefore, we assessed stressors, coping behaviors, and resources needed in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic in a sample of 162 perinatal (125 pregnant and 37 postpartum) women in the United States. METHODS: A mixed-methods study captured quantitative responses regarding stressors and coping, along with qualitative responses to open-ended questions regarding stress and resources needed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Logistic and linear regression models were used to analyze differences between pregnant and postpartum participants, as well as differences across key demographic variables. Qualitative content analysis was used to analyze open-ended questions. RESULTS: During the COVID-pandemic, food scarcity and shelter-in-place restrictions made it difficult for pregnant women to find healthy foods. Participants also reported missing prenatal appointments, though many reported using telemedicine to obtain these services. Financial issues were prevalent in our sample and participants had difficulty obtaining childcare. After controlling for demographic variables, pregnant women were less likely to engage in healthy stress-coping behaviors than postpartum women. Lastly, we were able to detect signals of increased stressors induced by the COVID-19 pandemic, and less social support, in perinatal women of racial and ethnic minority, and lower-income status. Qualitative results support our survey findings as participants expressed concerns about their baby contracting COVID-19 while in the hospital, significant others missing the delivery or key obstetric appointments, and wanting support from friends, family, and birthing classes. Financial resources, COVID-19 information and research as it relates to maternal-infant health outcomes, access to safe healthcare, and access to baby supplies (formula, diapers, etc.) emerged as the primary resources needed by participants. CONCLUSIONS: To better support perinatal women's mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare providers should engage in conversations regarding access to resources needed to care for newborns, refer patients to counseling services (which can be delivered online/via telephone) and virtual support groups, and consistently screen pregnant women for stressors.","Barbosa-Leiker, Celestina; Smith, Crystal Lederhos; Crespi, Erica J; Brooks, Olivia; Burduli, Ekaterina; Ranjo, Samantha; Carty, Cara L; Hebert, Luciana E; Waters, Sara F; Gartstein, Maria A",BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,,472

261358,Modeling the Consequences of Social Distancing Over Epidemics Spreading in Complex Social Networks: From Link Removal Analysis to SARS-CoV-2 Prevention,2021,"An unexpected outbreak of pneumonia of unfamiliar aetiology in Wuhan,Hubei, China was reported in December 2019. World Health Organization identified the pathogen and named it COVID-19. COVID-19 made the world go through a cisis. The impact of this viral disease is now an issue of major concern. Respiratory infections, dry cough with fever are the major symptoms which are due to beta coronavirus, namely Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Within a short spell, COVID-19 spread all over China. Since January to today 24 March 2020 this epidemic turned into pandemic with continuous rise of cases and deaths. Italy, Germany, Spain, USA, Iran, France are the countries where the disease is spreading in a community level and rest of the countries over the globe the positive cases are also coming in the report. As the disease is communicable, it is highly necessary to take measures before it starts spreading in countries like India where the population is very high. The treatment of this severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 is not clear so far. Prevention is the only way to stop spreading this fatal disease. In view of this, the total state of knowledge regarding COVID-19 and the suggestive prevention are discussed by considering countries (considering India) where the population is high and this pandemic just started spreading.","Sarkar, Argha; Kundu, Mayuri; Venkataramana, Padarthi; Chakraborty, Pinaki",Int.

262583,Leveraging Emotional Intelligence Competencies for Sustainable Development of Higher Education Institutions in the New Normal,2021,"Importance: It is now established that across the United States, minoritized populations have borne a disproportionate burden from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, little is known about the interaction among a county's racial/ethnic composition, its level of income inequality, political factors, and COVID-19 outcomes in the population. Objective: To quantify the association of economic inequality, racial/ethnic composition, political factors, and state health care policy with the incidence and mortality burden associated with COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study used data from the 3142 counties in the 50 US states and for Washington, DC. Data on the first 200 days of the COVID-19 pandemic, from the first confirmed US case on January 22 to August 8, 2020, were gathered from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and USAFacts.org, the US Census Bureau, the American Community Survey, GitHub, the Kaiser Family Foundation, the Council of State Governments, and the National Governors Association. Exposures: Racial/ethnic composition was determined as percentage of the population that is Black or Hispanic; income inequality, using the Gini index; politics, political affiliation and sex of the state governor, gubernatorial term limits, and percentage of the county's population that voted Republican in 2016; and state health care policy, participation in the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. Six additional covariates were assessed. Main Outcomes and Measures: Cumulative COVID-19 incidence and mortality rates for US counties during the first 200 days of the pandemic. Main measures include percentage Black and Hispanic population composition, income inequality, and a set of additional covariates. Results: This study included 3141 of 3142 US counties. The mean Black population was 9.365% (range, 0-86.593%); the mean Hispanic population was 9.754% (range, 0.648%-96.353%); the mean Gini ratio was 44.538 (range, 25.670-66.470); the proportion of counties within states that implemented Medicaid expansion was 0.577 (range, 0-1); the mean number of confirmed COVID-19 cases per 100â¯000 population was 1093.882 (range, 0-14â¯019.852); and the mean number of COVID-19-related deaths per 100â¯000 population was 26.173 (range, 0-413.858). A 1.0% increase in a county's income inequality corresponded to an adjusted risk ratio (RR) of 1.020 (95% CI, 1.012-1.027) for COVID-19 incidence and adjusted RR of 1.030 (95% CI, 1.012-1.047) for COVID-19 mortality. Inequality compounded the association of racial/ethnic composition through interaction, with higher income inequality raising the intercepts of the incidence curve RR by a factor of 1.041 (95% CI, 1.031-1.051) and that of the mortality curve RR by a factor of 1.068 (95% CI, 1.042-1.094) but slightly lowering their curvatures, especially for Hispanic composition. When state-level specificities were controlled, none of the state political factors were associated with COVID-19 incidence or mortality. However, a county in a state with Medicaid expansion implemented would see the incidence rate RR decreased by a multiplicative factor of 0.678 (95% CI, 0.501-0.918). Conclusions and Relevance: This county-level ecological analysis suggests that COVID-19 surveillance systems should account for county-level income inequality to better understand the social patterning of COVID-19 incidence and mortality. High levels of income inequality may harm population health irrespective of racial/ethnic composition.","Liao, Tim F; De Maio, Fernando",JAMA Netw Open,,472
263675,"Impact of urban land uses and activities on the ambient air quality in Klang Valley, Malaysia from 2014 to 2020",2020,"The objective of this study was to elucidate the pathophysiology that underlies severe COVID-19 by assessing the histopathology and the in situ detection of infectious SARS-CoV-2 and viral capsid proteins along with the cellular target(s) and host response from twelve autopsies. There were three key findings: 1) high copy infectious virus was limited mostly to the alveolar macrophages and endothelial cells of the septal capillaries; 2) viral spike protein without viral RNA localized to ACE2+ endothelial cells in microvessels that were most abundant in the subcutaneous fat and brain; 3) although both infectious virus and docked viral spike protein was associated with complement activation, only the endocytosed pseudovirions induced a marked up-regulation of the key COVID-19 associated proteins IL6, TNF alpha, IL1 beta, p38, IL8, and caspase 3. Importantly, this microvasculitis was associated with characteristic findings on hematoxylin and eosin examination that included endothelial degeneration and resultant basement membrane zone disruption and reduplication. It is concluded that serious COVID-19 infection has two distinct mechanisms: 1) a microangiopathy of pulmonary capillaries associated with a high infectious viral load where endothelial cell death releases pseudovirions into the circulation, and 2) the pseudovirions dock on ACE2+ endothelial cells most prevalent in the skin/subcutaneous fat and brain that activates the complement pathway/coagulation cascade resulting in a systemic procoagulant state as well as the expression of cytokines that produce the cytokine storm. The data predicts a favorable response to therapies based on either removal of circulating viral proteins and/or blunting of the endothelial-induced response.","Magro, Cynthia M; Mulvey, Justin; Kubiak, Jeffrey; Mikhail, Sheridan; Suster, David; Crowson, A Neil; Laurence, Jeffrey; Nuovo, Gerard",Ann Diagn Pathol,,472

We aim to assess the impact of organ injury (OI) on prognosis according to the number of affected organs at admission. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of patients with confirmed COVID-19 in Wuhan Third Hospital & Tongren Hospital of Wuhan University from February 17 to March 22, 2020. We classified the patients according to the presence and number of damaged organs (heart, liver, and kidney). RESULTS: The percentage of patients with no, one, two, or three organs affected was 59.75%, 30.46%, 8.07%, and 1.72%, respectively. With the increasing number of OI, there is a tendency of gradual increase regarding the white blood cell counts, neutrophil counts, levels of C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, D-dimer, and fibrinogen as well as the incidence of most complications. In a Cox regression model, individuals with OI, old age, and an abnormal level of C-reactive protein were at a higher risk of death compared with those without. Patients with three organ injuries had the highest mortality rate [57.9%; hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) vs. patients without OI: 22.31 (10.42-47.77), those with two (23.6%; HR 8.68, 95% CI 4.58-16.48), one (8.6%; HR 3.1, 95% CI 1.7-5.7), or no OI (2.6%); P < 0.001]. CONCLUSION: The increasing number of OI was associated with a high risk of mortality in COVID-19 infection. This article is protected by copyright.

266685,Entrepreneurship education for the digital generation: Invention or transformation?,2020,"Medical and public health professionals recommend wearing face masks to combat the spread of the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19). While the majority of people in the United States support wearing face masks as an effective tool to combat COVID-19, a smaller percentage declared the recommendation by public health agencies as a government imposition and an infringement on personal liberty. Social media play a significant role in amplifying public health issues, whereby a minority against the imposition can speak loudly, perhaps using tactics of verbal aggression taking the form of toxic language. We investigated the role that toxicity plays in the online discourse around wearing face masks. Overall, we found tweets including anti-mask hashtags were significantly more likely to use toxic language, while tweets with pro-mask hashtags were somewhat less toxic with the exception of #WearADamnMask. We conclude that the tensions between these two positions raise doubt and uncertainty around the issue, which make it difficult for health communicators to break through the clutter in order to combat the infodemic. Public health agencies and other governmental institutions should monitor toxicity trends on social media in order to better ascertain prevailing sentiment toward their recommendations and then apply these data-driven insights to refine and adapt their risk communication messaging toward mask wearing, vaccine uptake, and other interventions. © The Author(s) 2021.","Pascual-Ferrá, P.; Alperstein, N.; Barnett, D.

267114,Sustainable Product-Service Systems Customization: A Case Study Research in the Medical Equipment Sector,2021,"Resilience engineering understands that risks are emergent from the complexity of socio-technical systems. In this perspective, the risk assessment needs to analyze possibilities of potential risks emerging from system variabilities and interactions under hypothetical scenarios. While the Functional Resonance Analysis Method (FRAM) is a well-established method for analyzing system behavior in terms of variability, assessing relative risk levels requires more specific representation and handling of the quantitative aspects of variabilities to allow for comparative analysis and decision-making. This study proposed and examined a quantitative scheme to use FRAM for risk assessment by defining rules for variability propagation and aggregation. The proposed method represents the system more realistically with quantitative values, taking into account interactions and the adaptive operation of functions. The approach was tested via a walk-through application to an emergency response system for infectious disease. Three progressive scenarios are used in relation to managing crisis response for the 2019 coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19), and the results demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed method for assessing the relative importance of potential risks and critical conditions. Although the test example focused on a disease containment case, the proposed method can generally support strategic decision making during the governance of large-scale crisis response.","Kim, Yoo Chan Yoon Wan Chul",Reliability Engineering &amp; System Safety,,472

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, has led to high hospitalization rates worldwide. Little is known about the occurrence of in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) and high mortality rates have been proposed. The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence, characteristics and outcome of IHCA during the pandemic in comparison to an earlier period. METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of data prospectively recorded during 3-month-periods 2019 and 2020 at the University Medical Centre Hamburg-Eppendorf (Germany). All consecutive adult patients with IHCA were included. Clinical parameters, neurological outcomes and organ failure/support were assessed. RESULTS: During the study period hospital admissions declined from 18,262 (2019) to 13,994 (2020) (- 23%). The IHCA incidence increased from 4.6 (2019: 84 IHCA cases) to 6.6 (2020: 93 IHCA cases)/1000 hospital admissions. Median stay before IHCA was 4 (1-9) days. Demographic characteristics were comparable in both periods. IHCA location shifted towards the ICU (56% vs 37%, p < 0.01); shockable rhythm (VT/VF) (18% vs 29%, p = 0.05) and defibrillation were more frequent in the pandemic period (20% vs 35%, p < 0.05). Resuscitation times, rates of ROSC and post-CA characteristics were comparable in both periods. The severity of illness (SAPS II/SOFA), frequency of mechanical ventilation and frequency of vasopressor therapy after IHCA were higher during the 2020 period. Overall, 43 patients (12 with & 31 without COVID-19), presented with respiratory failure at the time of IHCA. The Horowitz index and resuscitation time were significantly lower in patients with COVID-19 (each p < 0.01). Favourable outcomes were observed in 42 and 10% of patients with and without COVID-19-related respiratory failure, respectively. CONCLUSION: Hospital admissions declined during the pandemic, but a higher incidence of IHCA was observed. IHCA in patients with COVID-19 was a common finding. Compared to patients with non-COVID-19-related respiratory failure, the outcome was improved.","Roedl, Kevin; Söffker, Gerold; Fischer, Dominik; Müller, Jakob; Westermann, Dirk; Issleib, Malte; Kluge, Stefan; Jarczak, Dominik",Scand J Trauma Resusc Emerg Med,,472

Little is known on the ocular involvement associated with the disease. The aim of this study was to assess the clinical and molecular ocular involvement among patients with confirmed COVID-19 admitted to a tertiary care facility. METHODS: Consecutive patients admitted to the COVID-19 Ward of the Shamir Medical Center in Israel during March and April, 2020 were included. The control group included patients negative for COVID-19 admitted during a similar period to a different ward. Patients were examined by trained Ophthalmologists. SARS-CoV-2 conjunctival swab samples were obtained. RESULTS: Included were 48 patients, 16 with confirmed COVID-19 and 32 controls. Median patient age was 68.5 (interquartile range: 31.5, mean: 63 ± 21) years and 48% were male. Active conjunctival injection was present in three patients (19%) with COVID-19, compared to none in the controls (p = 0.034). Patients with COVID-19 were more likely to complain of foreign body sensation (31.3% vs 3.1%, p = 0.005) and redness of the eye (25% vs 0%, p = 0.003). Conjunctival injection was associated with loss of smell and taste (75% vs 7.7%, p = 0.018). Viral conjunctival swab tests all showed negative results for all three viral genes tested (E, N, and RdRp). CONCLUSIONS: Among patients admitted to a tertiary referral center with confirmed COVID-19, active conjunctival injection was noted in one out of five cases, and was associated with loss of smell and taste. Conjunctival swabs for viral RNA were negative in patients with and without ocular involvement.","Shemer, Asaf; Einan-Lifshitz, Adi; Itah, Amir; Dubinsky-Pertzov, Biana; Pras, Eran; Hecht, Idan",Int. ophthalmol,,472

DESIGN: Using social media for recruitment, we partnered with a local community task force to administer a brief online survey. SETTING: Residential urban community. SAMPLE: Eighty-four community members, the majority of whom were white, female, college educated completed the survey. MEASURES: Theory of planned behavior constructs: behavioral intentions, attitudes, perceived norms, and perceived behavioral control for 3 social distancing behaviors: maintaining a 6-foot distance, avoiding places people congregate, and staying home as much as possible. ANALYSIS: Path analyses were conducted to understand significant determinants of intentions for each behavior to guide the development of locally tailored health promotion messages. RESULTS: The RCBD was implemented, and results were communicated to the community within 1 week. Intentions were high across the 3 behaviors but lowest for staying home as much as possible. Younger participants had lower intentions of maintaining a 6-foot distance than older participants. For each behavior, specific recommendations for health promotion messaging emerged based on how attitudes, norms, and perceived behavioral control related to intentions. CONCLUSION: In a situation where local community action is paramount for reducing coronavirus transmission, this RCBD process is feasible and useful for informing local health promotion.","Smith, Philip H; Branscum, Paul W",Am J Health Promot,,472

270529,Introductory lecture: air quality in megacities,2020,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is considered a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). As of April 3, 2020, there were 1,009,625 reported confirmed cases, and 51,737 reported deaths. Doctors have been faced with a myriad of patients who present with many different symptoms. This raises two important questions. What are the common symptoms, and what are their relative importance? METHODS: A non-structured and incomplete COVID-19 dataset of 14,251 confirmed cases was preprocessed. This produced a complete and organized COVID-19 dataset of 738 confirmed cases. Six different feature selection algorithms were then applied to this new dataset. Five of these algorithms have been proposed earlier in the literature. The sixth is a novel algorithm being proposed by the authors, called Variance Based Feature Weighting (VBFW), which not only ranks the symptoms (based on their importance) but also assigns a quantitative importance measure to each symptom. RESULTS: For our COVID-19 dataset, the five different feature selection algorithms provided different rankings for the most important top-five symptoms. They even selected different symptoms for inclusion within the top five. This is because each of the five algorithms ranks the symptoms based on different data characteristics. Each of these algorithms has advantages and disadvantages. However, when all these five rankings were aggregated (using two different aggregating methods) they produced two identical rankings of the five most important COVID-19 symptoms. Starting from the most important to least important, they were: Fever/Cough, Fatigue, Sore Throat, and Shortness of Breath. (Fever and cough were ranked equally in both aggregations.) Meanwhile, the sixth novel Variance Based Feature Weighting algorithm, chose the same top five symptoms, but ranked fever much higher than cough, based on its quantitative importance measures for each of those symptoms (Fever - 75 %, Cough - 39.8 %, Fatigue - 16.5 %, Sore Throat - 10.8 %, and Shortness of Breath - 6.6 %). Moreover, the proposed VBFW method achieved an accuracy of 92.1 % when used to build a one-class SVM model, and an NDCG@5 of 100 %. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the dataset, and the feature selection algorithms employed here, symptoms of Fever, Cough, Fatigue, Sore Throat and Shortness of Breath are important symptoms of COVID-19. The VBFW algorithm also indicates that Fever and Cough symptoms were especially indicative of COVID-19, for the confirmed cases that are documented in our database.","Alzubaidi, Mohammad A; Otoom, Mwaffaq; Otoum, Nesreen; Etoom, Yousef; Banihani, Rudaina",Artif Intell Med,,472

AIMS: To assess the impact of the pandemic and subsequent lockdown on stroke admissions and transient ischaemic attack referrals at the Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle-Upon-Tyne, and additionally on patient behaviours affecting modifiable risk factors or perspectives related to accessing healthcare. METHODS: A single-centre retrospective data analysis was carried out on a ""lockdown"" cohort of suspected stroke patients admitted between 11 March to 26 May 2020 and a ""pre-lockdown"" cohort admitted in 2019. Differences in weekly admissions, weekly referrals, onset-to-presentation time and weekly thrombolysis cases were examined. Further analysis interrogated these cohorts separated by Bamford classification and stroke mimics (such as seizure/hemiplegic migraine/functional neurology). A binary-format questionnaire was separately administered to admitted patients from 15 April to 5 June 2020. RESULTS: Significant reductions in weekly posterior circulation infarct (-43%, p = 0.017) and stroke-mimic (-47%, p < 0.001) admissions and weekly referrals diagnosed as non-transient ischaemic attack (-55%, p = 0.002) were observed in the lockdown cohort, with no differences in onset-to-presentation time. Over 25% of questionnaire respondents reported less physical activity, increased isolation and delaying their presentation due to the pandemic.

It has affected millions of people globally with an average lethality of â¼3%. There is an urgent need of drugs for the treatment of COVID-19. In the current studies, we have used bioinformatics techniques to screen the FDA approved drugs against nine SARS-CoV2 proteins to identify drugs for repurposing. Additionally, we analyzed if the identified molecules can also affect the human proteins whose expression in lung changed during SARS-CoV2 infection. Targeting such genes may also be a beneficial strategy to curb disease manifestation. We have identified 74 molecules that can bind to various SARS-CoV2 and human host proteins. We experimentally validated our in-silico predictions using vero E6 cells infected with SARS-CoV2 virus. Interestingly, many of our predicted molecules viz. capreomycin, celecoxib, mefloquine, montelukast, and nebivolol showed good activity (IC50) against SARS-CoV2. We hope that these studies may help in the development of new therapeutic options for the treatment of COVID-19.","Kumar, Sugandh; Singh, Bharati; Kumari, Pratima; Kumar, Preethy V; Agnihotri, Geetanjali; Khan, Shaheerah; Kant Beuria, Tushar; Hussain Syed, Gulam; Dixit, Anshuman",,,472

The first pool was from a Carassius auratus (crusian carp) cell line and the second was from Ctenopharyngodon idella (grass carp) head kidney tissue. BLAST analysis suggests that these sequences belong to SARS-like coronaviruses, and that they are not evolutionarily conserved in other species. Investigation of the submitting laboratories revealed that two laboratories from the Institute of Hydrobiology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Wuhan, China performed the research and submitted the cDNA libraries to GenBank. This institution is very close in proximity to the Wuhan South China Seafood Wholesale Market where SARS-CoV-2 first amplified in the human population. It is possible that these sequences are an artifact of the bioinformatics pipeline that was used. It is also possible that SARS-like coronaviruses are a common environmental pathogen in the region that may be in aquatic habitats.","Conway, Michael J",J. med. virol,,472

METHODS: We enumerated SARS-CoV-2-specific interferon-Î³-producing CD69+ CD4+ and CD8+ T cells at months 4 and 6 from the diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in 21 KT recipients by intracellular cytokine staining. Overlapping peptides encompassing the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein N-terminal 1- to 643-amino acid sequence and the membrane protein were used as stimulus. SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies targeting the S1 protein were assessed by ELISA at month 6. RESULTS: Detectable (&#8805;0.1%) SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T-cell response was found in 57.1% and 47.4% of patients at months 4 and 6. Corresponding rates for CD8+ T cells were 19.0% and 42.1%, respectively. Absolute SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell counts increased from month 4 to month 6 in CD8+ (P = 0.086) but not CD4+ subsets (P = 0.349). Four of 10 patients with any detectable response at month 4 had lost SARS-CoV-2-CMI by month 6, whereas 5 of 9 patients mounted SARS-CoV-2-CMI within this period. All but 2 patients (89.5%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG. Patients lacking detectable SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ response by month 6 were more likely to be under tacrolimus (100.0% versus 66.7%; P = 0.087) and to have received tocilizumab for the previous COVID-19 episode (40.0% versus 0.0%; P = 0.087).

The length of sickness absence of the healthcare workers as a result of SARS-CoV-2 infection plays a pivotal role in hospital staff management. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore the timing of COVID-19 recovery and viral clearance, and its predictive factors, in a large sample of healthcare workers. STUDY DESIGN: This is a retrospective cohort study. METHODS: The analysis was conducted on data collected during the hospital health surveillance programme for healthcare staff at the University Hospital of Verona; healthcare workers were tested for SARS-CoV-2 through RT-PCR with oronasopharyngeal swab samples. The health surveillance programme targeted healthcare workers who either had close contact with SARS-CoV-2-infected patients or were tested as part of the screening-based strategy implemented according to national and regional requirements. Recovery time was estimated from the first positive swab to two consecutive negative swabs, collected 24 h apart, using survival analysis for both right-censored and interval-censored data. Cox proportional hazard was used for multivariate analysis. RESULTS: During the health surveillance programme, 6455 healthcare workers were tested for SARS-CoV-2 and 248 (3.8%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.4-4.3) reported positive results; among those who tested positive, 49% were asymptomatic, with a median age of 39.8 years, which is significantly younger than symptomatic healthcare workers (48.2 years, P < 0.001). Screening tests as part of the health surveillance programme identified 31 (12.5%) of the positive cases. Median recovery time was 24 days (95% CI: 23-26) and 21.5 days (95% CI: 15.5-30.5) in right- and interval-censoring analysis, respectively, with no association with age, sex or presence of symptoms. Overall, 63% of participants required >20 days to test negative on two consecutive swabs. Hospitalised healthcare workers (4.8%) were older and had a significantly longer recovery time compared with non-hospitalised healthcare workers in both analyses (33.5 vs 24 days, P = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Recovery from COVID-19 and viral clearance may take a long time, especially in individuals who are hospitalised. To detect asymptomatic cases, screening programmes for healthcare workers is recommended.","Benoni, R; Campagna, I; Panunzi, S; Varalta, M S; Salandini, G; De Mattia, G; Turrina, G; Moretti, F; Lo Cascio, G; Spiteri, G; Porru, S; Tardivo, S; Poli, A; Bovo, C",Public Health,,472

We performed a cross-sectional bibliometric analysis between 23rd March and 14th April 2020. Three sources of data were used: (1) deaths per number of population for COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 retrieved from John Hopkins University and Worldometer, (2) publications related to COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 retrieved from World Health Organisation COVID-19 database, and (3) tweets of these publications retrieved from Altmetric.com and Twitter. In the analysis, the number of publications used was 1761, and number of tweets used was 751,068. Mapping of worldwide data illustrated that high Twitter activity was related to high numbers of COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 deaths, with tweets inversely weighted with number of publications. Regression models of worldwide data showed a positive correlation between the national deaths per number of population and tweets when holding number of publications constant (coefficient 0.0285, S.E. 0.0003, p < 0.001).

Digital interventions may help to mitigate these effects. We investigated the associations between social isolation, COVID-19-related cognitive preoccupation, worries, and anxiety, objective social risk indicators, and psychological distress, as well as use of, and attitude toward, mobile health (mHealth) interventions in youth. METHODS: Data were collected as part of the ""Mental Health And Innovation During COVID-19 Survey""-a cross-sectional panel study including a representative sample of individuals aged 16-25 years (N = 666; Mage = 21.3; assessment period: May 5, 2020 to May 16, 2020). RESULTS: Overall, 38% of youth met criteria for moderate or severe psychological distress. Social isolation worries and anxiety, and objective risk indicators were associated with psychological distress, with evidence of dose-response relationships for some of these associations. For instance, psychological distress was progressively more likely to occur as levels of social isolation increased (reporting ""never"" as reference group: ""occasionally"": adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 9.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] 4.3-19.1, p < 0.001; ""often"": aOR 22.2, CI 9.8-50.2, p < 0.001; ""very often"": aOR 42.3, CI 14.1-126.8, p < 0.001). There was evidence that psychological distress, worries, and anxiety were associated with a positive attitude toward using mHealth interventions, whereas psychological distress, worries, and anxiety were associated with actual use. CONCLUSIONS: Public health measures during pandemics may be associated with poor mental health outcomes in youth. Evidence-based digital interventions may help mitigate the negative psychosocial impact without risk of viral infection given there is an objective need and subjective demand.","Rauschenberg, Christian; Schick, Anita; Goetzl, Christian; Roehr, Susanne; Riedel-Heller, Steffi G; Koppe, Georgia; Durstewitz, Daniel; Krumm, Silvia; Reininghaus, Ulrich",Eur Psychiatry,,472

METHOD: We linked data from a post outbreak telephone survey in 2020 by the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe, with baseline data from SHARE Wave 6 (2016) (n = 33,485). Two mental health measures (depression and anxiety) were regressed on social network variables relevant to the Covid-19 crisis (frequency of face-to-face contact and frequency of contact through electronic means), controlling for confounders. Interactions of age group and social networks were considered. Baseline mental health was controlled, focusing the analysis on post-outbreak mental health change. RESULTS: Face-to-face network contact significantly reduced negative mental health changes while electronic contact significantly increased them. The age interactions were insignificant. Country differences were observed. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that face-to-face social networks can moderate the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on important aspects of mental health.","Litwin, Howard; Levinsky, Michal",Aging Ment Health,,472

The temporal distribution and burden of the disease varies from setting to setting based on economic status, demography and geographic location. A rapid increase in the number of COVID-19 cases is being reported in Africa as of June 2020. Ethiopia reported the first COVID-19 case on 13 March 2020. Limited molecular laboratory capacity in resource constrained settings is a challenge in the diagnosis of the ever-increasing cases and the overall management of the disease. In this article, the Ethiopian Public Health Institute (EPHI) shares the experience, challenges and prospects in the rapid establishment of one of its COVID-19 testing laboratories from available resources. The first steps in establishing the COVID-19 molecular testing laboratory were i) identifying a suitable space ii) renovating it and iii) mobilizing materials including consumables, mainly from the Malaria and Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) research team at the EPHI. A chain of experimental design was set up with distinct laboratories to standardize the extraction of samples, preparation of the master mix and detection. At the commencement of sample reception and testing, laboratory contamination was among the primary challenges faced. The source of the contamination was identified in the master mix room and resolved. In summary, the established COVID-19 testing lab has tested more than 40,000 samples (August 2020) and is the preferred setting for research and training. The lessons learned may benefit the further establishment of emergency testing laboratories for COVID-19 and/or other epidemic/pandemic diseases in resource-limited settings.","Abera, Adugna; Belay, Habtamu; Zewude, Aboma; Gidey, Bokretsion; Nega, Desalegn; Dufera, Boja; Abebe, Abnet; Endriyas, Tujuba; Getachew, Birhanu; Birhanu, Henok; Difabachew, Hailemariam; Mekonnen, Bacha; Legesse, Helina; Bekele, Firdawek; Mekete, Kalkidan; Seifu, Seble; Sime, Heven; Yemanebrhan, Nebiyou; Tefera, Mesfin; Amare, Hiwot; Beyene, Berhane; Tsige, Estifanos; Kebede, Adisu; Tasew, Geremew; Tollera, Getachew; Abate, Ebba; Woyessa, Adugna; Assefa, Ashenafi",Glob Health Action,,472

Converging evidence examining the acoustics of masked speech shows that different styles of masks have differential effects on sound attenuation. The purpose of this study was to compare speech intelligibility in different mask conditions (no mask, disposable surgical mask, cloth mask, and N95 respirator). Four native English speakers recorded unpredictable sentences, which avoid the confound of contextual predictability. Sentences were mixed with multitalker babble to simulate the noise experienced by listeners during activities of daily living. Forty-one listeners heard 24 pseudorandomized unpredictable sentences from the four mask conditions and typed what they heard. We measured intelligibility as the percentage of whole words correctly perceived. Acoustic analysis revealed that all masks filter the signal, with the greatest overall effect for the N95 respirator. A mixed model two-way ANOVA showed a significant effect of mask condition, driven by the low percent words correct for N95 respirators. Our error analysis revealed that listeners more often provided no response for the N95 respirator, but supplied phonetic approximations for surgical and cloth masks. © 2021 Acoustical Society of America.","Randazzo, M.; Koenig, L.

The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review of the association of SDH with child maltreatment. METHODS: Five data sources (PubMed, Web of Science Core Collection, SCOPUS, JSTORE, and the Social Intervention Research and Evaluation Network Evidence Library) were searched for studies examining the following SDH: poverty, parental educational attainment, housing instability, food insecurity, uninsurance, access to healthcare, and transportation. Studies were selected and coded using the PICOS statement. RESULTS: The search identified 3441 studies; 33 were included in the final database. All SDH categories were significantly associated with child maltreatment, except that there were no studies on transportation or healthcare. The greatest number of studies were found for poverty (n = 29), followed by housing instability (13), parental educational attainment (8), food insecurity (1), and uninsurance (1). CONCLUSIONS: SDH, including poverty, parental educational attainment, housing instability, food insecurity, and uninsurance, are associated with child maltreatment. These findings suggest an urgent priority should be routinely screening families for SDH, with referrals to appropriate services, a process that could have the potential to prevent both child maltreatment and subsequent recidivism. IMPACT: SDH, including poverty, parental educational attainment, housing instability, food insecurity, and uninsurance, are associated with child maltreatment.No prior published systematic review, to our knowledge, has examined the spectrum of SDH with respect to their associations with child maltreatment.These findings suggest an urgent priority should be routinely screening families for SDH, with referrals to appropriate services, a process that could have the potential to prevent both child maltreatment and subsequent recidivism.","Hunter, Amy A; Flores, Glenn",Pediatr. res,,472

We examine risk for co-infection among construction and agricultural workers, incarcerated persons, Black and Latino populations, and persons living in high dust areas. We further identify common risk factors for co-infection, including older age, diabetes, immunosuppression, racial or ethnic minority status, and smoking. Because these diseases cause similar symptoms, the COVID-19 pandemic might exacerbate delays in coccidioidomycosis diagnosis, potentially interfering with prompt administration of antifungal therapies. Finally, we examine the clinical implications of co-infection, including severe COVID-19 and reactivation of latent coccidioidomycosis. Physicians should consider coccidioidomycosis as a possible diagnosis when treating patients with respiratory symptoms. Preventive measures such as wearing face masks might mitigate exposure to dust and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, thereby protecting against both infections.","Heaney, Alexandra K; Head, Jennifer R; Broen, Kelly; Click, Karen; Taylor, John; Balmes, John R; Zelner, Jon; Remais, Justin V",Emerg Infect Dis,,472

Although a strong psychological impact is possible, scant evidence is available to date. Past studies have shown that resilience decreases the negative effects of stress. This study aimed to examine depression, anxiety, and stress among the Italian general population during the phase characterized by lockdown, and to investigate the role of resilience as a potential predictor. Methods: A total sample of 6,314 Italian people participated in this study. Participants were recruited between March 29 and May 04 2020 through an online survey. The Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21 (DASS-21) and the Resilience Scale (RS) were administered. Demographic data and lockdown related information were also collected. A correlational analysis was carried out to examine relationships between psychopathological domains and resilience. Three hierarchical regression analyses were conducted using the depression, anxiety, and stress as dependent variables and the resilience as independent variable controlling for age, gender, and education. COVID-19 specific variables were also included in the three regression analyses. A further exploratory analysis was carried out to examine which aspects of resilience predict depression, anxiety, and stress. Results: The prevalence of moderate to extremely severe symptoms among participants was 32% for depression, 24.4% for anxiety, and 31.7% for stress. The sample mean scores on depression, anxiety, and stress were higher than the normal scores reported in the literature. Results of correlational analysis showed that resilience factors, such as meaningfulness, self-reliance, existential aloneness, and equanimity, are inversely associated with depression, anxiety, and stress. Results of regression analyses indicated that resilience was statically significant in predicting depression, anxiety, and stress. Geographic area of residence and infected acquaintances were also significant predictors. Regarding the resilience factors, results revealed that meaningfulness, perseverance, and equanimity were statistically significant in predicting all the DASS-21 scales. Conclusion: About a third of respondents reported moderate to extremely severe depression, anxiety, and stress. The present study suggests that psychological resilience may independently contribute to low emotional distress and psychological ill-being. These findings can help explain the variability of individual responses during the COVID-19 outbreak.","Lenzo, Vittorio; Quattropani, Maria C; Musetti, Alessandro; Zenesini, Corrado; Freda, Maria Francesca; Lemmo, Daniela; Vegni, Elena; Borghi, Lidia; Plazzi, Giuseppe; Castelnuovo, Gianluca; Cattivelli, Roberto; Saita, Emanuela; Franceschini, Christian",Front Psychol,,472

293369,Crisis of Oversight: How Coronavirus Deepened Voters' Desires for Accountability in Higher Ed,2020,"In December 2019, an outbreak of a novel infection under the working name 2019-nCoV was registered in Wuhan (the Hubei Province located in China's central region), which has quickly spread throughout almost the entire world and become pandemic. The World Health Organization (WHO) proposed a new name coronavirus disease (COVID-19) for this disease, whereas the International Committee on Virus Taxonomy renamed 2019-nCov as SARS-Cov-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2). The development of the COVID-19 pandemic is not only of great social importance, but also draws the attention of a medical community to the fundamentally new clinical and fundamental problems of the immunopathology of human diseases that are yet to be formulated. The unique experience gained in rheumatology from studies of the pathogenetic mechanisms and pharmacotherapy of immune-mediated inflammatory rheumatic diseases (IMIRDs) can be of great importance for deciphering the nature of the pathological processes that underlie the severe, potentially fatal complications of COVID-19, and may assist in improving their therapy. As for prospects in patients with IMIRDs, although the development of COVID-19 in the presence of IMIRDs has not yet fortunately been described, infection with SARS-CoV-2, like other viruses, can be assumed to cause an exacerbation of the pathological process, whereas severe immune system pathology and comorbidities can worsen the course of infection. Since, according to the current concepts, it is the «hyperimmune» response, and not just the effect only of the virus itself, that underlies lung damage and deaths from COVID-19, special attention is drawn to the effects of antirheumatic therapy that includes glucocorticoids, disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), biological agents, and targeted DMARDs, which can have a multidirectional effect on the course of COVID-19. There are significant theoretical prerequisites for the repurposing of some drugs widely used in rheumatology for the treatment of COVID-19 and its complications. Consideration is given to the prospects of studying the immunopathology of COVID-19 and to the theoretical justifications for the use of antimalarial 4-aminoquinolines, anti-cytokine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), and Janus kinase inhibitors for the prevention of complications and for the treatment of COVID-19.","Nasonov, E.

In this study, we reported three cases of suspected COVID-19-dengue coinfection in hospitals of Bali, Indonesia. Serological data demonstrated that patients with positive results for dengue virus (DENV) NS1 antigen and anti-dengue IgM were also reactive to COVID-19 rapid antibody tests, suggesting dengue-COVID-19 coinfection. However, two patients were later confirmed negative for SARS-COV-2 by qRT-PCR, implying a plausible cross-reactivity of anti-dengue and anti-COVID-19 antibodies in the serological test. Coinfection of dengue and COVID-19 was evident in one patient, following confirmation of SARS-COV-2 by qRT-PCR and DENV infection using the NS1 antigen serology test.

The level of detail involved with this checklist is a deviation from standard intubation practices and is likely unfamiliar to most emergency physicians. However, the two-person system used in our department removes the cognitive burden such complexity would otherwise demand and minimises the number of participants that would typically be exposed during endotracheal intubation. We share this checklist to demonstrate to other departments how adopting international airway guidelines to a specific institution can be achieved in order to promote healthcare worker safety.","Barnicle, Ryan; Bracey, Alexander; Zahid, Bassam; Davic, Alexandra; Weingart, Scott",Emerg Med J,,472

Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are the most commonly used controller medications in patients with asthma. It is unclear whether ICS use increases the risk for severe COVID-19 infection. At the current time, asthma organizations are still recommending the continued use of ICS and other asthma medications to minimize the risk of uncontrolled asthma. However, for patients with asthma and who have recovered from COVID-19 infection, the timing of resumption of asthma therapy is equally uncertain. Pulmonary function testing and exhaled oral nitric oxide testing are aerosol-generating procedures and are currently being severely restricted at most health-care facilities. We presented a case of a patient with cough-variant asthma who developed severe COVID-19 associated acute respiratory distress syndrome with the need for intubation and prolonged mechanical ventilation.

The major clinical feature of severe COVID-19 patients requiring ventilation is acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) possibly associated with a cytokine storm. Objectives: To elucidate serum levels of TNF-&#945; and soluble TNF-Receptor 1 (sTNFR1) in patients with severe and mild COVID-19 disease as determinants of disease severity. Methods: We determined serum TNF-&#945; and sTNFR1 concentrations in 46 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 (17 patients with severe disease within the intensive care unit [ICU] and 29 non-severe, non-ICU patients) and 15 healthy controls upon admission using ELISA. Subjects were recruited between March-May 2020 at the Masih Daneshvari Hospital Tehran, Iran. Results: Serum levels of sTNFRI were significantly higher in ICU patients (P<0.0001) and non-ICU patients (P=0.0342) compared with healthy subjects. Serum sTNFR1 were significantly higher in ICU patients than in non-ICU patients (P<0.0001). Serum TNF-&#945; levels were greater in ICU and non-ICU patients than in the healthy subjects group (p<0.0001). The sTNFRI concentration in ICU (r=0.79, p=0.0002) and non-ICU (r=0.42, p=0.02) patients positively correlated with age although serum sTNFRI levels in ICU patients were significantly higher than in older healthy subjects. The sTNFRI concentration in ICU patients negatively correlated with ESR. Conclusions: The study demonstrates higher sTNFRI in ICU patients with severe COVID-19 disease and this be a biomarker of disease severity and mortality. Future studies should examine whether lower levels of systemic sTNFR1 at admission may indicate a better disease outcome.","Mortaz, Esmaeil; Tabarsi, Payam; Jamaati, Hamidreza; Dalil Roofchayee, Neda; Dezfuli, Neda K; Hashemian, Seyed MohammadReza; Moniri, Afshin; Marjani, Majid; Malekmohammad, Majid; Mansouri, Davood; Varahram, Mohammad; Folkerts, Gert; Adcock, Ian M",Front Immunol,,472

The SARS-CoV-2 infection has triggered an impressive amount of clinical and experimental studies to identify an effective and safe therapy to stop the pandemic spread. Hence, numerous trials and studies have scrutinized the analogies between SARS-CoV-2 and other corona viruses or the host-virus interactions and their similarities with immune system disorders. Still, the pathogenic mechanisms behind SARS-CoV-2 have been partially deciphered and the current therapies have not yet met the initial enthusiastic expectations. So far COVID-19 therapies have targeted various pathogenic mechanisms, namely the neutralization of ACE2 receptors or SARS-CoV-2 spike protein epitopes, the disruption of the endocytic pathways using hydroxychloroquine, arbidol, or anti-Janus kinase inhibitors, the inhibition of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase using nucleotide analogues such as remdesivir, immunosuppressive drugs or molecules acting on the immune response (corticoids, interferons, monoclonal antibodies against inflammatory cytokines, mesenchymal stem cells) and convalescent plasma administration together with numerous drugs with unproven effect against SARS-CoV-2 but with potential antiviral activities (antiretrovirals, antimalarial drugs, antibiotics, etc.). Nevertheless, these therapies have been associated with side effects and contradictory results. At the same time a specific SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is a long-term solution requiring clinical validation and important investments together with appropriate strategies to promote the confidence in the safety of the new vaccine. The article revises the current state of SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic options but advises towards a more cautious and individualized treatment approach centred on the clinical features, immune particularities, and the risk-benefit balance.","Iacob, Simona; Iacob, Diana Gabriela",Front.

301362,Convergence of expectations of the stakeholders of education in law – a reality or a utopia?,2020,"The causative agent of COVID-19 pandemic, the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, has a 29,903 bases positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome. RNAs exhibit about 100 modified bases that are essential for proper function. Among internal modified bases, the N6-methyladenosine, or m6A, is the most frequent, and is implicated in SARS-CoV-2 immune response evasion. Although the SARS-CoV-2 genome is RNA, almost all genomes sequenced so far are in fact, reverse transcribed complementary DNAs. This process reduces the true complexity of these viral genomes because incorporation of dNTPs hides RNA base modifications. Here, in this perspective paper, we present an initial exploration of the Nanopore direct RNA sequencing to assess the m6A residues in the SARS-CoV-2 sequences of ORF3a, E, M, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, ORF8, N, ORF10 and the 3-untranslated region. We identified 15 m6A methylated positions, of which, 6 are in ORF N. Also, because m6A is associated with the DRACH motif, we compared its distribution in major SARS-CoV-2 variants. Although DRACH is highly conserved among variants we show that variants Beta and Eta have a fourth position C>U change in DRACH at 28,884b that could affect methylation. The Nanopore technology offers a unique opportunity for the study of viral epitranscriptomics. This technique is PCR-free and is not sequencing-by-synthesis, therefore, no PCR bias and synthesis errors are introduced. The modified bases are preserved and assessed directly with no need for chemical treatments or antibodies. This is the first report of direct RNA sequencing of a Brazilian SARS-CoV-2 sample coupled with the identification of modified bases.","Campos, Joao H.; Maricato, Juliana T.; Braconi, Carla T.; Antoneli, Fernando; Janini, Luiz Mario R.; Briones, Marcelo RS",,,472

Human neutralizing antibodies that target the host ACE2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein1-5 show promise therapeutically and are being evaluated clinically6-8. Here, to identify the structural correlates of SARS-CoV-2 neutralization, we solved eight new structures of distinct COVID-19 human neutralizing antibodies5 in complex with the SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer or RBD. Structural comparisons allowed us to classify the antibodies into categories: (1) neutralizing antibodies encoded by the VH3-53 gene segment with short CDRH3 loops that block ACE2 and bind only to 'up' RBDs; (2) ACE2-blocking neutralizing antibodies that bind both up and 'down' RBDs and can contact adjacent RBDs; (3) neutralizing antibodies that bind outside the ACE2 site and recognize both up and down RBDs; and (4) previously described antibodies that do not block ACE2 and bind only to up RBDs9. Class 2 contained four neutralizing antibodies with epitopes that bridged RBDs, including a VH3-53 antibody that used a long CDRH3 with a hydrophobic tip to bridge between adjacent down RBDs, thereby locking the spike into a closed conformation. Epitope and paratope mapping revealed few interactions with host-derived N-glycans and minor contributions of antibody somatic hypermutations to epitope contacts. Affinity measurements and mapping of naturally occurring and in vitro-selected spike mutants in 3D provided insight into the potential for SARS-CoV-2 to escape from antibodies elicited during infection or delivered therapeutically. These classifications and structural analyses provide rules for assigning current and future human RBD-targeting antibodies into classes, evaluating avidity effects and suggesting combinations for clinical use, and provide insight into immune responses against SARS-CoV-2.","Barnes, Christopher O; Jette, Claudia A; Abernathy, Morgan E; Dam, Kim-Marie A; Esswein, Shannon R; Gristick, Harry B; Malyutin, Andrey G; Sharaf, Naima G; Huey-Tubman, Kathryn E; Lee, Yu E; Robbiani, Davide F; Nussenzweig, Michel C; West, Anthony P; Bjorkman, Pamela J",Nature,,472

Recently established causality in impulse response functions and variance test to everyday data from January 2020 has been implied. To recognize the effect of the food cost crisis, statistics are separated into two intervals i.e. post-COVID period and the pre-COVID period. The variance causality test indicates that the risk transmission among agricultural commodity is zero, but oil market volatility spills on the markets for agricultural products excluding sugar in the post-crisis period. Thus, this paper signifies that the statistical volatility transmission differs post food price crisis.

During the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in Nigeria, couples were compelled to spend more time together, regardless of their pre-existing challenges. Our study aims to determine the prevalence of IPV, its forms, and mental health implications among Nigerian households amid the COVID-19 lockdown. A cross-sectional study was implemented which used the snowball sampling technique to recruit 474 participants across 31 states in Nigeria. A semi-structured online questionnaire was distributed using the WhatsApp platform. The relationship between IPV, its forms, and associated factors were analyzed using descriptive analysis and logistic regression with significant value at p &#8804; .05 and confidence interval of 95%. Majority (98.1%) of the participants had at least a college degree and 90.1% were employed. Overall prevalence of IPV ranged from 7.2% to 13.5%. Using the lockdown as the landmark, higher prevalence was found before than during the lockdown across physical, emotional, financial, and sexual forms of IPV. Emotional form had the highest prevalence both before and during the lockdown with 11.4% and 3.8% respectively. Furthermore, 22.6% of participants reported that the lockdown affected their mental health. Hopelessness, feelings of failure, being irritable, and constantly under strain were psychological symptoms significantly associated with IPV amid the lockdown. Decreased prevalence of IPV were found in the early phase of the pandemic, suggesting that couples can experience less partner violence during periods of confinement. Our study supports existing evidence that forms of IPV have negative mental health consequences on abused partners.","Ojeahere, Margaret Isioma; Kumswa, Sahmicit Kankemwa; Adiukwu, Frances; Plang, Janet Punyit; Taiwo, Yetunde Folake",J Interpers Violence,,472

While medicines, drugs, and vaccines against the COVID-19 are being developed, social isolation has become the most used method for controlling the virus spreading. With the social isolation, authorities aimed to slow down the spreading, avoiding saturation of the healthcare system, and allowing that all critical COVID-19 cases could be appropriately treated. By tuning the proposed model to fit Brazil's initial COVID-19 data, the objectives of the paper are to analyze the impact of the social isolation features on the population dynamics; simulate the number of deaths due to COVID-19 and due to the lack of healthcare infrastructure; study combinations of the features for the healthcare system does not collapse; and analyze healthcare system responses for the crisis. Methods In this paper, a Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed model is described in terms of probabilistic cellular automata and ordinary differential equations for the transmission of COVID-19, flexible enough for simulating different scenarios of social isolation according to the following features: the start day for the social isolation after the first death, the period for the social isolation campaign, and the percentage of the population committed to the campaign. Results Results showed that efforts in the social isolation campaign must be concentrated both on the isolation percentage and campaign duration to delay the healthcare system failure. For the hospital situation in Brazil at the beginning of the pandemic outbreak, a rate of 200 purchases per day of intensive care units and mechanical ventilators is the minimum rate to prevent the collapse of the healthcare system. Conclusions By using the model for different scenarios, it is possible to estimate the impact of social isolation campaign adhesion. For instance, if the social isolation percentage increased from 40% to 50% in Brazil, the purchase rate of 150 intensive care units and mechanical ventilators per day would be enough to prevent the healthcare system to collapse. Moreover, results showed that a premature relaxation of the social isolation campaign can lead to subsequent waves of contamination.","Schimit, P H T",Comput Methods Programs Biomed,,472

310102,A case study of teaching Single Variable Calculus traditionally vs. virtually: a semester bifurcated,2021,"We introduced virtual fracture liaison clinics during the COVID-19 pandemic in order to support clinical care while DXA services were down-turned. We observed that virtual FLS clinics are effective in delivering fracture risk assessment, health promotion, and clinical management and are well received by patients with positive patient experience. INTRODUCTION: We examined the impact of virtual FLS telephone clinics, as an alternative to face-to-face clinics during the COVID-19 lockdown. METHODS: Patients presenting with low trauma fracture were recruited according to standard criteria. A structured telephone clinic appointment was offered, which included fracture risk and health promotion assessment and a treatment plan. Risk factors, demographics, fracture type, FRAX scores, and outcomes were analysed. We assessed patient experience with an anonymised patient survey. RESULTS: Clinical outcomes from virtual clinics were assessed (77F/33M; mean age 65.7 years). The mean 10-year observed fracture risk for major osteoporotic fracture was 18.2% and 7.0% for hip fracture. We observed high 'attendance' rates at 79%; however, a significant number were still not available for telephone review (11%) or cancelled their appointment (10%). A recommendation for bisphosphonate treatment was made in 54% of the cohort based on National Osteoporosis Guidelines Group (NOGG) criteria. Follow-up DXA assessment is planned for 64%, according to fracture risk and NOGG guidance. We received 60 responses from the initial patient survey. Ninety percent rated their overall experience of service at 4 or 5 (very good to excellent). Ninety-eight indicated they would recommend the service to others. CONCLUSIONS: Virtual clinics are effective in delivery of fracture risk assessment and clinical management with positive patient experience. While a significant proportion will require DXA follow-up to complete the clinical assessment, virtual clinics have mitigated delays in fracture prevention interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic.","English, S; Coyle, L; Bradley, S; Wilton, W; Cordner, J; Dempster, R; Lindsay, J R",Osteoporosis int,,472
310566,Learning Mathematics From Home During COVID-19: Insights From Two Inquiry-Focussed Primary Schools,2021,"BACKGROUND: The introduction of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 infection, in the UK in early 2020, resulted in the introduction of several control policies to reduce disease spread. As part of these restrictions, schools were closed to all pupils in March (except for vulnerable and key worker children), before re-opening to certain year groups in June. Finally, all school children returned to the classroom in September. METHODS: Here, we analyse data on school absences in late 2020 as a result of COVID-19 infection and how that varied through time as other measures in the community were introduced. We utilise data from the Department for Education Educational Settings database and examine how pupil and teacher absences change in both primary and secondary schools. RESULTS: Our results show that absences as a result of COVID-19 infection rose steadily following the re-opening of schools in September. Cases in teachers declined during the November lockdown, particularly in regions previously in tier 3, the highest level of control at the time. Cases in secondary school pupils increased for the first 2 weeks of the November lockdown, before decreasing. Since the introduction of the tier system, the number of absences with confirmed infection in primary schools was observed to be (markedly) lower than that in secondary schools. In December, we observed a large rise in the number of absences per school in secondary school settings in the South East and London, but such rises were not observed in other regions or in primary school settings. We conjecture that the increased transmissibility of the new variant in these regions may have contributed to this rise in secondary school cases. Finally, we observe a positive correlation between cases in the community and cases in schools in most regions, with weak evidence suggesting that cases in schools lag behind cases in the surrounding community. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that there is no significant evidence to suggest that schools are playing a substantial role in driving spread in the community and that careful monitoring may be required as schools re-open to determine the effect associated with open schools upon community incidence.","Southall, Emma; Holmes, Alex; Hill, Edward M; Atkins, Benjamin D; Leng, Trystan; Thompson, Robin N; Dyson, Louise; Keeling, Matt J; Tildesley, Michael J",BMC Med,,472

311863,Business Dynamics in Recovery Times: A Comparative Perspective on Manufacturing Firms' Performance in the European Union,2021,"Objectives: The World Bank has projected that the low-and-middle income countries (LMICs) would face economic crisis induced by the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown. However, the economic implications of lockdown policy on households in LMICs is largely speculated. This study evaluated the economic impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on individuals and households in Nigeria. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey was used to collect data. Nigerian citizens who were domiciled or restricted from travelling abroad for no less than one month since the COVID-19 restrictions and lockdown were recruited into the study through focal persons purposively selected across the different states in Nigeria. The respondents completed the survey on household income and expenditure before and during the lockdown. Economic burden of COVID-19 lockdown on individuals and families was estimated using a prevalence-based cost of illness approach. Results: Four hundred and four (Male = 242;Female = 162) individuals have participated in the study. The mean (SD) age of the respondents was 30.98 (10.92) years. There was difference in mean (SD) monthly income before and during the lockdown (₦263389.27 (USD690.4) (SD ₦2589649.2)) vs. (₦207704.9 (USD544.4) (SD ₦1846806.84)). The overall household expenditure before and during the lockdown periods were USD 320 and USD 290. The total mean monthly costs for COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 health related problems were ₦11746.25 (USD 30.79) and ₦11784.9 (USD 30.89). Household expenditure for hand sanitizers, facemasks, hand gloves, and disinfectants increased significantly during the COVID-19 restriction lockdown (p &lt; 0.05). However, expenditure on education, water, electricity, fuel for generating set, internet data, clothing and wears, toiletries decreased significantly during the lockdown period (p &lt; 0.05). Conclusions: This study suggest that the costs of continuing COVID-19 restrictions could have huge economic consequences on households and health system. Thus, easing COVID-19 lockdown that reduces its economic impact through targeted measures such as social distancing are necessary.","Fatoye, F.; Gebrye, T.; Arije, O.

METHODS: This cross-sectional study was carried out on 250 Iranian pregnant women. Data was collected through questionnaires including demographic and obstetric characteristics, fear of COVID-19 and quality of life. An adjusted general linear model was used to determine the relationship between variables. RESULTS: There was a negatively significant relationship between fear of COVID-19 and quality of life (P < 0.001). Based on the adjusted general linear model, it was expected that if COVID-19 fear score increased, the quality of life score would decrease significantly (B = -0.21, 95%CI: -0.34 to -0.09, P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: This study indicated a reverse correlation between fears of COVID-19 and quality of life. Therefore, developing appropriate interventions in order to overcome the fear caused by COVID-19 are recommended to improve pregnant women's quality of life.","Naghizadeh, Somayyeh; Mirghafourvand, Mojgan",Arch Psychiatr Nurs,,472

Moderate-severe disease is associated with a high incidence of pulmonary embolisms, generally peripherally distributed and associated with endothelial damage, prolonged stays in bed, and coagulopathy. Other relatively common complications are spontaneous pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum due to the rupture of alveolar walls and barotrauma in mechanically ventilated patients.

314152,From Survival to Business Prosperity: the Financial Aspect of Managing an Organization in a Crisis,2020,"BACKGROUND: Global vaccine development efforts have been accelerated in response to the devastating COVID-19 pandemic. We evaluated the impact of a 2-dose COVID-19 vaccination campaign on reducing incidence, hospitalizations, and deaths in the United States (US). METHODS: We developed an agent-based model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and parameterized it with US demographics and age-specific COVID-19 outcomes. Healthcare workers and high-risk individuals were prioritized for vaccination, while children under 18 years of age were not vaccinated. We considered a vaccine efficacy of 95% against disease following 2 doses administered 21 days apart achieving 40% vaccine coverage of the overall population within 284 days. We varied vaccine efficacy against infection, and specified 10% pre-existing population immunity for the base-case scenario. The model was calibrated to an effective reproduction number of 1.2, accounting for current non-pharmaceutical interventions in the US. RESULTS: Vaccination reduced the overall attack rate to 4.6% (95% CrI: 4.3% - 5.0%) from 9.0% (95% CrI: 8.4% - 9.4%) without vaccination, over 300 days. The highest relative reduction (54-62%) was observed among individuals aged 65 and older. Vaccination markedly reduced adverse outcomes, with non-ICU hospitalizations, ICU hospitalizations, and deaths decreasing by 63.5% (95% CrI: 60.3% - 66.7%), 65.6% (95% CrI: 62.2% - 68.6%), and 69.3% (95% CrI: 65.5% - 73.1%), respectively, across the same period. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that vaccination can have a substantial impact on mitigating COVID-19 outbreaks, even with limited protection against infection. However, continued compliance with non-pharmaceutical interventions is essential to achieve this impact.","Moghadas, Seyed M; Vilches, Thomas N; Zhang, Kevin; Wells, Chad R; Shoukat, Affan; Singer, Burton H; Meyers, Lauren Ancel; Neuzil, Kathleen M; Langley, Joanne M; Fitzpatrick, Meagan C; Galvani, Alison P",Clin. infect. dis,,472

A present COVID-19 has high transmission rates worldwide, including in small Brazilian cities such as Ijuí. Located in the northwest part of the state of Rio Grande do Sul (RS) and with a population of 83,475, Ijuí was selected as the site of a population-based survey involving 2,222 subjects, from April to June 2020. Subjects were tested for the presence of antibodies against coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and answered questions regarding social distance adherence (SDA), daily preventive routines (DPR), comorbidities, and sociodemographic characteristics. In parallel, the local government registered the official COVID-19 cases in Ijuí, as well as the mobile social distancing index (MSDI). In this study, we demonstrate that there was a decrease in the levels of SDA, DPR and MSDI before the beginning of COVID-19 community transmission in Ijuí.

324264,The Impact of COVID-19: A Need for SMEs to Understand Business Model Innovation,2021,"Background: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and first reported in December 2019 at Wuhan, China, has since then progressed into an ongoing global pandemic. The primary organ targeted by the virus is the pulmonary system, leading to interstitial pneumonia and subsequent oxygen dependency and morbidity. Computed tomography (CT) has been used by various centers as an imaging modality for the assessment of severity of lung involvement in individuals. Two popular systems of scoring lung involvement on CT are CT semiquantitative score (SQ) and CT severity score (CT-SS), both of which assess extent of pulmonary involvement by interstitial pneumonia and are partly based upon subjective evaluation. Our cross-sectional observational study aims to assess the interobserver reliability of these scores, as well as to assess the statistical correlation between the respective CT scores to severity of clinical outcome. Results: Both the SQ and CT-SS scores showed an excellent interobserver reliability (ICC 0.91 and 0.93, respectively, p &lt; 0.05). The CT-SS was marginally more sensitive (99.2%) in detecting severe COVID pneumonia than SQ (86.5%). The positive predictive value of SQ (98.3%) is more than CT-SS (78%) for detecting severe disease. The similarity of interobserver reliability obtained for both scores reiterates the respective cutoff CT scores proposed by the above systems, as 18 for SQ and 19.5 for CT-SS. Conclusion: Both the SQ and CT-SS scores display excellent interobserver reliability. The CT-SS was more sensitive in detecting severe COVID pneumonia and may thus be preferred over the SQ as an initial radiological tool in predicting severity of infection.","Andrew, D.; Shyam, K.; Cicilet, S.; Johny, J.",Egyptian Journal of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine,,472

VirusViz is a web-based application for comparing variants of selected viral populations and their sub-populations; it is primarily focused on SARS-CoV-2 variants, although the tool also supports other viral species (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, Dengue, Ebola). As input, VirusViz imports results of queries extracting variants and metadata from the large database ViruSurf, which integrates information about most SARS-CoV-2 sequences publicly deposited worldwide. Moreover, VirusViz accepts sequences of new viral populations as multi-FASTA files plus corresponding metadata in CSV format; a bioinformatic pipeline builds a suitable input for VirusViz by extracting the nucleotide and amino acid variants. Pages of VirusViz provide metadata summarization, variant descriptions, and variant visualization with rich options for zooming, highlighting variants or regions of interest, and switching from nucleotides to amino acids; sequences can be grouped, groups can be comparatively analyzed. For SARS-CoV-2, we manually collect mutations with known or predicted levels of severity/virulence, as indicated in linked research articles; such critical mutations are reported when observed in sequences. The system includes light-weight project management for downloading, resuming, and merging data analysis sessions.

In this article we have analyzed existing evidence on the immune response against SARS coronaviruses in order to understand the possible outcome of a vaccine for COVID-19. From our analysis it becomes clear that there is a big difference in the immune response against SARS in children, young adults and the elderly, both at the innate and adaptive levels. Taking this information into account, we have studied the strategies that are being used for development of COVID-19 vaccines. We discuss the perspectives for obtention and worldwide distribution of reliable vaccines using this perspective. The conclusion is that different vaccines may be protective for different age segments within the population, depending on the strategy used for their design. Therefore, it will become necessary for several vaccines to reach the finish line, not only to ensure availability, but also to guarantee an adequate immune response at the individual level.","Campillo, Nuria E; Jimenez, Mercedes; Canelles, Matilde",Curr. med. chem,,472

Although it is primarily transmitted by contact and droplets, aerosol-generating procedures also seem to carry the possibility of airborne viral transmission. As such, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy can be considered a risky procedure, with several position statements recommending the adoption of safe practices in endoscopic procedures. This article aims to describe an additional tool to protect healthcare personnel during endoscopy. Methods A covering box made of acrylic plastic, named Endoprotector, was designed to cover the patient's head, while taking into consideration movements performed by patients and healthcare staff during an endoscopic procedure. Results A cough simulation using fluorescent dye confirmed the potential benefit of the box during endoscopy, thus protecting healthcare staff from air droplets. The feasibility and practicality of the box was also tested with patients during endoscopy. Conclusion The reusable Endoprotector is easily and affordably manufactured and may reduce air droplets and airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and other microorganisms during endoscopy.","Campos, Sara; Carreira, Cátia; Marques, Pedro Pinto; Vieira, Ana",Endosc.

METHOD: Approximately 522 patients with allergic rhinitis, asthma, COPD, and COVID-19 were analysed for demographic and clinical features. Radiological features were analysed only for COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: COPD and asthma were more common among COVID-19 patients than allergic rhinitis. All chest CT scans of COVID-19 patients showed bilateral ground-glass opacity. Fever, dry cough, diarrhea, loss of sense of smell and taste, shortness of breath, and blue lips were significantly higher in all COVID-19 patients compared to COPD, asthma, and allergic rhinitis patients. CONCLUSION: The presence of clinical symptoms such as fever, dry cough, diarrhea, loss of sense of smell and taste, shortness of breath, and blue lips in COVID-19 patients, can be used for differential diagnosis between COVID-19 patients and other respiratory diseases. Then, the diagnosis can be confirmed by chest CT scan for COVID-19 patients without the need for a nasopharyngeal swab or PCR test, especially in epidemic countries. Allergic rhinitis patients are the least exposed to COVID-19 infection among other respiratory disease patients.","Sarhan, Rania M; Mohammad, Mohammad F; Boshra, Marian S",Int J Clin Pract,,472

We report our preliminary experience with 18 SOT (kidney [44.4%], liver [33.3%], and heart [22.2%]) recipients diagnosed with COVID-19 by March 23, 2020 at a tertiary-care center at Madrid. Median age at diagnosis was 71.0 ± 12.8 years, and the median interval since transplantation was 9.3 years. Fever (83.3%) and radiographic abnormalities in form of unilateral or bilateral/multifocal consolidations (72.2%) were the most common presentations. Lopinavir/ritonavir (usually associated with hydroxychloroquine) was used in 50.0% of patients and had to be prematurely discontinued in 2 of them. Other antiviral regimens included hydroxychloroquine monotherapy (27.8%) and interferon-ß (16.7%). As of April 4, the case-fatality rate was 27.8% (5/18). After a median follow-up of 18 days from symptom onset, 30.8% (4/13) of survivors developed progressive respiratory failure, 7.7% (1/13) showed stable clinical condition or improvement, and 61.5% (8/13) had been discharged home.

This review details the latest evidence on the neuropathogenesis and neurologic complications of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. RECENT FINDINGS: Commonly reported neurologic complications include toxic-metabolic encephalopathy, acute cerebrovascular disorders, seizures, and anoxic-brain injury. These complications represent secondary injury due to COVID-19 related hypoxia, sepsis, hypercoagulability, or hyperinflammation. Postinfectious complications, such as encephalitis, postinfectious demyelination, and Guillain-Barré syndrome have been reported, but are rare. Recent reports of persistent neurocognitive symptoms highlight the possibility of lasting impairment. SUMMARY: Although some neurologic complications should be treated with standard practices, further investigations are still needed to determine the optimal treatment of COVID-related neurologic complications, such as ischemic stroke. Entering into the next phase of the pandemic, investigations into the long-term neurologic and cognitive impacts of SARS-CoV-2 infection will be needed. Clinicians must have a high clinical suspicion for both acute and chronic neurologic complications among COVID-19 patients.","Hassett, Catherine E; Frontera, Jennifer A",Curr Opin Infect Dis,,472

Comparing respondents' answers about their most fundamental aspects of life during and after the pandemic, including income level, expenditure structure and level, purchase method, study method, food price and quality, and dining habit, both the descriptive and econometric models reveal that Chinese consumers' life patterns were not significantly changed. These findings may imply a ""new normal"" where consumers stick to their new living habits that were forged during the pandemic. Therefore, policy makers have to envisage such an implicative socio-economic change (cost) brought by the implementation of a lock down policy in a long run, in addition to direct and explicit economic losses. However, improving food quality and controlling food price appear to be the strong and stable safety signals to reassure consumers in this complicated environment.","Yuan, Xiaoling; Li, Caijuan; Zhao, Kai; Xu, Xiaoyu",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,472

We sought to reduce overutilisation of CXRs obtained in this setting, using a multifaceted intervention to eliminate automated daily studies. Methods: Within a 45-bed multidisciplinary ICU of a tertiary teaching hospital in Brazil, we prospectively applied a three-step intervention from May 2017 to April 2018. Firstly, a partnership formed by physician champions from both ICU and Radiology and marketing coordinators advertised Choosing Wisely recommendations for Critical Care as emails and banners. The aforementioned team educated ICU staff physicians and residents about the low diagnostic yield of automated daily CXRs through didactic sections. Then, formal discussions about CXR need for each patient during morning ICU rounds was adopted. Finally, the programmed daily order option from the electronic health records system was removed. A reeducation lecture was held in August 2018 and partial audit data was shown. Results: From May to October 2018, all CXR images were urgently acquired, and their average time was 43 minutes from order to availability. Before intervention, the median number of CXRs per patient per day was 0.38 (0.36 - 0.40). After, this amount decreased to 0.30 (0.28 - 0.32) [p= 0.0013], representing a 22% reduction on CXR request. Mean length of ICU stay before and after campaign was, respectively, 8.14 (7.79 - 8.71) and 8.45 (8.24 - 9.74) days [p= 0.35]. Mean mortality rate before and after intervention was, respectively, 18.45% (± 3.87%) and 21.58% (± 2.23%) [p = 0.12]. Conclusions: This was the first report of a Choosing Wisely initiative in a Brazilian ICU of a public hospital. Transition to a high value on-demand CXR strategy in ICUs is safe and particularly noteworthy in a low resource public health system.","Antonio, A. C.; Barcellos, G.

The extensive pressure of managing health care during the pandemic establishes the need for rapid implementation of telemedicine. Across our large statewide practice of 640 practitioners at 221 sites of service, an aggressive multidisciplinary telemedicine strategy was implemented in March by coordinating and training many different parts of our healthcare delivery system. From March to September, telemedicine grew to serve 15%-20% of new patients and 20%-25% of established patients, permitting the practice to implement safety protocols and reduce volumes in clinic while continuing to manage the acute and chronic care needs of our patient population. We surveyed practice leaders, queried for qualitative feedback, and established 76% were satisfied with the platform. The common challenges for patients were the first-time use and technology function, and patients were, in general, grateful and happy to have the option to visit their clinicians on a telemedicine platform. In addition to conducting new and established visits remotely, telemedicine allows risk assessments, avoidance of hospitalization, family education, psychosocial care, and improved pharmacy support. The implementation has limitations including technical complexity; increased burden on patients and staff; and broadband access, particularly in rural communities. For telemedicine to improve as a solution to enhance the longitudinal care of patients with cancer, payment coverage policies need to continue after the pandemic, technologic adoption needs to be easy for patients, and broadband access in rural areas needs to be a policy priority. Further research to optimize the patient and clinician experience is required to continue to make progress.","Patt, Debra A; Wilfong, Lalan; Toth, Sara; Broussard, Stephanie; Kanipe, Kristen; Hammonds, Jason; Allen, Victoria; Mautner, Beatrice; Campbell, Nakedra; Dubey, Ajay K; Wu, Nini; Neubauer, Marcus; Jones, Ben S; Paulson, R Steven",JCO Oncol Pract,,472

Treatment with PLX5622, an inhibitor of colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) that efficiently depletes microglia, prior to infection of the central nervous system (CNS) with the neurotropic JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus (JHMV) resulted in increased mortality compared with control mice that correlated with impaired control of viral replication. Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNASeq) of CD45+ cells isolated from the CNS revealed that PLX5622 treatment resulted in muted CD4+ T cell activation profile that was associated with decreased expression of transcripts encoding MHC class II and CD86 in macrophages but not dendritic cells. Evaluation of spinal cord demyelination revealed a marked increase in white matter damage in PLX5622-treated mice that corresponded with elevated expression of transcripts encoding disease-associated proteins Osteopontin (Spp1), Apolipoprotein E (Apoe), and Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (Trem2) that were enriched within macrophages. In addition, PLX5622 treatment dampened expression of Cystatin F (Cst7), Insulin growth factor 1 (Igf1), and lipoprotein lipase (Lpl) within macrophage populations which have been implicated in promoting repair of damaged nerve tissue and this was associated with impaired remyelination. Collectively, these findings argue that microglia tailor the CNS microenvironment to enhance control of coronavirus replication as well as dampen the severity of demyelination and influence repair.","Mangale, Vrushali; Syage, Amber R; Ekiz, H Atakan; Skinner, Dominic D; Cheng, Yuting; Stone, Colleen L; Brown, R Marshall; O039,; Connell, Ryan M; Green, Kim N; Lane, Thomas E",Glia,,472

The effect of these initiatives on surgical provision is unknown. The primary objective was to determine the effect of public health policies and surgical society guidelines implemented during the pandemic on elective and emergency caseload of surgical specialities operating within South East Queensland. METHODS: This observational study utilized non re-identifiable electronic data to quantify the caseload of surgical specialities across five secondary and tertiary referral hospitals in South East Queensland prior to and during the implementation of such initiatives. All patients undergoing a surgical procedure between 1 March and 24 April 2019 and the same period in 2020 were included. Participants' demographic and clinical information, such as age, the American Society of Anesthesiologists score, surgical date and location, surgical subspecialty and procedure name, was included. RESULTS: During the 2020 time period, there were 2991 elective cases compared to 4422 surgeries occurring in the same period in 2019 (32.4% reduction). Meanwhile, 2082 emergency surgeries were performed in the 2020 period compared to 2362 in 2019 (12.0% decrease). Ophthalmology and dental/ear, nose and throat/maxillofacial surgery experienced the largest reduction in elective surgeries, whereas emergency caseload increased for vascular and cardiothoracic services, and only slightly decreased for plastics and urology. CONCLUSION: The public health initiatives and guidance implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic reduced surgical specialties' elective caseload. However, emergency caseload was not affected to the same extent. This insight helps to guide resource allocation in future waves of the pandemic.","Fowler, Samuel; Zahir, Syeda F; Manning, Warrick; Kearney, Allison; Sturgess, David",ANZ J Surg,,472

The concept that PARP1 becomes activated in acute lung injury (ALI) and that pharmacological inhibition or genetic deletion of this enzyme can provide therapeutic benefits emerged over 20 years ago. The current article provides an overview of the cellular mechanisms involved in the pathogenetic roles of PARP1 in ALI and provides an overview of the preclinical data supporting the efficacy of PARP (poly[ADP-ribose] polymerase) inhibitors. In recent years, several ultrapotent PARP inhibitors have been approved for clinical use (for the therapy of various oncological diseases): these newly-approved PARP inhibitors were recently reported to show efficacy in animal models of ALI. These observations offer the possibility of therapeutic repurposing of these inhibitors for patients with ALI. The current article lays out a potential roadmap for such repurposing efforts. In addition, the article also overviews the scientific basis of potentially applying PARP inhibitors for the experimental therapy of viral ALI, such as coronavirus disease (COVID-19)-associated ALI.","Szabo, Csaba; Martins, Vanessa; Liaudet, Lucas",Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol,,472

334830,“Small things matter most”: The Spillover effects in the cryptocurrency market and Gold as a silver bullet,2020,"Understanding the dynamics by which urban areas attract visitors is significant for urban development in cities. In addition, identifying services that relate to highly attractive districts is useful to make policies regarding the placement of such places. Thus, we present a framework for classifying districts in cities by their attractiveness to visitors, and relating Points of Interests (POIs) types to districts' attraction patterns. We used Origin-Destination matrices (ODs) mined from cell phone data that capture the flow of trips between each pair of places in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. We define the attraction profile for a place based on three main statistical features: The amount of visitors a place received, the distribution of distance traveled by visitors on the road network, and the spatial spread of where visitors come from. We use a hierarchical clustering algorithm to classify all places in the city by their features of attraction. We detect three types of Urban Attractors in Riyadh during the morning period: Global which are significant places in the city, Downtown which the central business district and Residential attractors. In addition, we uncover what makes these places different in terms of attraction patterns. We used a statistical significance testing approach to rigorously quantify the relationship between Points of Interests (POIs) types (services) and the 3 patterns of Urban Attractors we detected. The proposed framework can be used for detecting the attraction patterns given by type of services related to each pattern. This is a critical piece of information to inform trip distribution models.","Alhazzani, May; Alhasoun, Fahad; Alawwad, Zeyad; Gonz'alez, Marta C.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.08696v1.pdf,472

The researchers suggested that high d-dimer levels could predict disease severity, lung complications, and thromboembolic events before they occur. Materials and Methods: We searched in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science using the keywords ""D-dimer"" and ""coronavirus"" or ""D-dimer"" and ""COVID-19."" We used Standardized Mean Differences (SMD) to build forest plots of continuous data and assess differences in serum D-dimer concentrations between severe and non-severe patients with COVID-19 disease. We evaluated p-value < 0.05 as statistically significant and preferred 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Result: The pooled results of all studies revealed that the D-dimer concentrations were significantly higher in patients with more severe COVID-19 (SMD: 2.32 µg/mL; 95% CI, 0.72 3.92 µg/mL, p< 0.001). We evaluated severe patients with total D-dimer levels. D-dimer concentrations were significantly higher in severe patients against total COVID-19 patients (SMD: 2.01 µg/mL; 95% CI, 0.25 to 3.77 µg/mL, p= 0.08). Conclusions: We do not know the D-dimer increment mechanism in severe patients yet, but we think that these findings will be useful in the early diagnosis of severe disease and the first treatment.","Düz, Muhammed Emin; Balci, Aydin; Menekse, Elif",Tuberk Toraks,,472

337045,Exploring supply chain structural dynamics: New disruptive technologies and disruption risks,2020,"The proper functioning of the immune system requires a robust control over a delicate equilibrium between an ineffective response and immune overactivation. Poor responses to viral insults may lead to chronic or overwhelming infection, whereas unrestrained activation can cause autoimmune diseases and cancer. Control over the magnitude and duration of the antiviral immune response is exerted by a finely tuned positive or negative regulation at the DNA, RNA, and protein level of members of the type I interferon (IFN) signaling pathways and on the expression and activity of antiviral and proinflammatory factors. As summarized in this review, committed research during the last decade has shown that several of these processes are exquisitely regulated by long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), transcripts with poor coding capacity, but highly versatile functions. After infection, viruses, and the antiviral response they trigger, deregulate the expression of a subset of specific lncRNAs that function to promote or repress viral replication by inactivating or potentiating the antiviral response, respectively. These IFN-related lncRNAs are also highly tissue- and cell-type-specific, rendering them as promising biomarkers or therapeutic candidates to modulate specific stages of the antiviral immune response with fewer adverse effects.","Suarez, Beatriz; Prats-Mari, Laura; Unfried, Juan P; Fortes, Puri",,,472
337119,The relationship between eco-innovation and smart working as support for sustainable management,2021,"Background: Understanding carriage and transmission potential of SARS-CoV-2 in children is of paramount importance to understand the spread of virus in school and community settings. Methods: We performed an updated rapid review to investigate the role of children in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. We synthesized evidence for five categories and results are reported narratively. Results: A total of 33 new studies were included for this review. We did not identify additional studies that reported documented cases of SARS-CoV-2 transmission by children. We identified 15 new studies that demonstrate children's susceptibility and transmission risk of SARS-CoV-2 with evidence provided on the chance of being index or secondary cases, the potential of faecal-oral transmission, and the possibility of asymptomatic transmission. There is little data on the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in schools. There were three studies reporting COVID-19 school outbreaks in France (Oise), Australia (New South Wales) and Israel. The remaining four studies found that all reported cases did not infect any other pupils or staff. With data from seven studies and governmental websites, the proportion of children among all confirmed COVID-19 patients was estimated for 29 countries, varying from 0.3% (lowest in Spain) up to 13.8% (highest in Argentina). Lastly, we identified seven studies reporting on PIMS-TS linked to COVID-19 among paediatric patients. Conclusions: There is somewhat limited evidence available for quantifying the extent to which children may contribute to overall transmission, but the balance of evidence so far suggests that children and schools play only a limited role in overall transmission.","Li, Xue; Xu, Wei; Dozier, Marshall; He, Yazhou; Kirolos, Amir; Lang, Zhongyu; Song, Peige; Theodoratou, Evropi",J Glob Health,,472

SARS-CoV-2 caused COVID-19 has reached a pandemic level. COVID-19 can significantly affect patients' cardiovascular systems. First, those with COVID-19 and preexisting cardiovascular disease have an increased risk of severe disease and death. Mortality from COVID-19 is strongly associated with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and hypertension. Second, therapies under investigation for COVID-19 may have cardiovascular side effects of arrhythmia. Third, COVID-19 is associated with multiple direct and indirect cardiovascular complications. Associated with a high inflammatory burden related to cytokine release, COVID-19 can induce vascular inflammation, acute myocardial injury, myocarditis, arrhythmias, venous thromboembolism, metabolic syndrome and Kawasaki disease. Understanding the effects of COVID-19 on the cardiovascular system is essential for providing comprehensive medical care for cardiac and/or COVID-19 patients.

One feature of the SARS-CoV-2 genome that is not present in related, common coronaviruses is ORF10, a putative 38-amino acid protein-coding gene. Proteomic studies found that ORF10 binds to an E3 ubiquitin ligase containing Cullin-2, Rbx1, Elongin B, Elongin C, and ZYG11B (CRL2ZYG11B). Since CRL2ZYG11B mediates protein degradation, one possible role for ORF10 is to ""hijack"" CRL2ZYG11B in order to target cellular, antiviral proteins for ubiquitylation and subsequent proteasomal degradation. Here, we investigated whether ORF10 hijacks CRL2ZYG11B or functions in other ways, for example, as an inhibitor or substrate of CRL2ZYG11B While we confirm the ORF10-ZYG11B interaction and show that the N terminus of ORF10 is critical for it, we find no evidence that ORF10 is functioning to inhibit or hijack CRL2ZYG11B Furthermore, ZYG11B and its paralog ZER1 are dispensable for SARS-CoV-2 infection in cultured cells. We conclude that the interaction between ORF10 and CRL2ZYG11B is not relevant for SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro.","Mena, Elijah L; Donahue, Callie J; Vaites, Laura Pontano; Li, Jie; Rona, Gergely; O039,; Leary, Colin; Lignitto, Luca; Miwatani-Minter, Bearach; Paulo, Joao A; Dhabaria, Avantika; Ueberheide, Beatrix; Gygi, Steven P; Pagano, Michele; Harper, J Wade; Davey, Robert A; Elledge, Stephen J",Proc.

In addition, while scientists are desperately attempting to produce a vaccine for COVID-19, a large segment of the populace still believes in conspiracies related to vaccines. Therefore, it is not surprising that the diagnosis of abusive head trauma (AHT) faces similar challenges - the difference being that AHT challenges are mostly in the realms of law courts rather than actual clinical management of these infants. Against this backdrop, the Child Abuse Imaging Committee of the Society for Pediatric Radiology (SPR) collaborated with other leading experts to develop the consensus statement on AHT. This consensus statement has had a significant impact since its publication. It is now endorsed by 17 multinational, multidisciplinary organizations. The consensus statement has helped educate the diverse stakeholders of AHT and has helped further our understanding of AHT and the issues related to it. This could serve as the template for developing future consensus documents.","Choudhary, Arabinda K",Pediatr Radiol,,472

STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: The study was conducted online by reviewing all accredited otolaryngology residency programs in the United States participating in the Electronic Residency Application Service. METHODS: Otolaryngology residency programs were reviewed for social media presence on Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook. Social media posts were evaluated for virtual open houses and virtual subinternships. Residency websites and the Visiting Student Application Service were evaluated for the presence of virtual subinternships. All data were collected between September 5, 2020, and September 9, 2020. This study did not require approval from the University of Alabama at Birmingham Institutional Review Board for Human Use. RESULTS: Among 118 otolaryngology residency programs, 74 (62.7%) participate on Instagram, 52 (44.1%) participate on Twitter, and 44 (37.3%) participate on Facebook. Fifty-one Instagram accounts, 20 Twitter accounts, and 4 Facebook accounts have been created during 2020. Forty-two (36%), 30 (25.4%), and 15 (13%) programs are promoting virtual open houses on Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook, respectively. Two programs on the Visiting Student Application Service offered virtual subinternships. Seven residency program websites offered virtual subinternships. Nine, 6, and 1 program offered virtual subinternships on Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook, respectively. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that social media presence on Instagram and Twitter among otolaryngology residency programs has substantially grown in 2020 at a higher rate compared to previous years. These data suggest that otolaryngology residency programs are finding new ways to reach out to applicants amid an unprecedented type of application cycle due to the challenges presented by COVID-19. Many programs are advertising virtual open houses via social media platforms to connect with applicants, and a few programs are offering virtual subinternships to replace traditional subinternships.","DeAtkine, Andrew B; Grayson, Jessica W; Singh, Nikhi P; Nocera, Alexander P; Rais-Bahrami, Soroush; Greene, Benjamin J",Ear Nose Throat J,,472

DESIGN: Prospective quality improvement initiative. SETTING: Two long-term chronic care campuses within a large academic healthcare organization. PARTICIPANTS: LTC residents with activated healthcare proxies who lacked DNH directives based on documentation in the electronic medical record (EMR) as of April 13, 2020. INTERVENTION: Using a structured discussion guide, trained healthcare staff from various disciplines contacted the residents' proxies to conduct COVID-19 focused ACP discussions. Residents without DNH directives with COVID-19 were prioritized. Preferences ascertained in the discussion were communicated to the residents' primary care teams and directives were updated in the EMR accordingly. MEASUREMENTS: Residents who acquired a new DNH directive during the study initiative were determined using the EMR. Subsequent changes in DNH orders, hospitalizations, and deaths were ascertained by retrospective chart review from the date of new DNH through August 5, 2020. RESULTS: At baseline, 315/581 (54%) of LTC residents did not have a DNH directive. Their mean age was 87 (±9) years and 70% were female. Following ACP discussions, 124/315 (39%) of residents acquired a new DNH directive. Among residents with new DNH directives, 65/124 (52%) were diagnosed with COVID-19 from April 2, 2020 to May 21, 2020. During follow-up, only 6/124 (4.8%) residents had their DNH order reversed, 2/124 (1.6%) residents were hospitalized with illnesses unrelated to COVID-19, and 29/124 (23%) died. CONCLUSIONS: There was substantial opportunity to increase the proportion of LTC residents with DNH orders during the COVID-19 pandemic through a systematic ACP initiative which utilized real-time EMR data. New directives to avoid hospitalizations were sustained among the majority of residents beyond the peak of the pandemic.","Berning, Michelle J; Palmer, Emily; Tsai, Timothy; Mitchell, Susan L; Berry, Sarah D",J Am Geriatr Soc,,472

We do not calibrate our models parameters, but we estimate all of them based on a clear hierarchical procedure of squared error minimization. The estimated parameters of the ratio between symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, the proportion of infected individuals that die and the usual epidemiological parameters have a great match with the ones provided by the literature. Our final models provide precise forecasts of the number of infected individuals. We use these models to discuss different scenarios of public policies. Long terms forecasts show that the confinement policy imposed by the government is able to flatten the pattern of infection of the COVID-19 and we are able to find the optimal date to end the policy. However, our results show that if this policy does not last enough time, it is only able to shift the peak of infection into the future keeping the value of the peak in almost the same value.","Bastos, Saulo B.; Cajueiro, Daniel O.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.14288v1.pdf,472

347404,Editors' Introduction,2020,"Coronaviruses (CoVs) were first discovered in the 1960s. Severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been identified as the cause of COVID-19, which spread throughout China and subsequently, across the world. As COVID-19 causes serious public health concerns across the world, investigating the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and its interaction with the host immune responses may provide a clearer picture of how the pathogen causes disease in some individuals. Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 has 80% sequence homology with SARS-CoV-1 and 96-98% homology with CoVs isolated from bats. Therefore, the experience acquired in SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) epidemics may improve our understanding of the immune response and immunopathological changes in COVID-19 patients. In the present paper, we have reviewed the immune responses (including the innate and adaptive immunities) to SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, so as to improve our understanding of the concept of the COVID-19 disease, which will be helpful in developing vaccines and medications for treating the COVID-19 patients.","Vafaeinezhad, Arefe; Atashzar, Mohammad Reza; Baharlou, Rasoul",Int Arch Allergy Immunol,,472

The transition required changes in teaching practices to accommodate for an online learning environment. However, there are no studies characterizing physical educators' and school health experts' perspectives on physical education via distance learning or identifying best practices and their implications for student health. METHODS: Using purposive and snowball sampling, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 19 physical education teachers and school health experts across 21 California school districts on best practices for physical education via distance learning. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using a grounded theory approach. RESULTS: Four major themes emerged: (1) participants felt high quality physical education via distance learning was both critical and possible; (2) strategies for creating a successful distance learning environment included personalization, creativity, and inclusiveness; (3) resources necessary for success included professional development, administrative support, and equipment; and (4) lessons for the long-term. CONCLUSIONS: Participants identified effective strategies, challenges, and recommendations for the future. Participants felt optimistic about their ability to provide quality physical education via distance learning, given the necessary supports, and perceived that they played a critical role in supporting student health during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Vilchez, Jocelyn A; Kruse, John; Puffer, Maryjane; Dudovitz, Rebecca N",J Sch Health,,472

Particularly, coronaviruses are mentioned among the viruses implicated in autoimmunity. Today, the world's greatest threat derives from the pandemic of a new human coronavirus, called ""severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2"" (SARS-CoV-2), the responsible agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). COVID-19 originated in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei, China in December 2019 and, to date, has spread to at least 187 countries. This review focuses on autoimmune manifestations described during COVID-19, including pro-thrombothic state associated to antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL), acute interstitial pneumonia, macrophage activation syndrome, lymphocytopenia, systemic vasculitis, and autoimmune skin lesions. This offers the opportunity to highlight the pathogenetic mechanisms common to COVID19 and several autoimmune diseases, in order to identify new therapeutic targets. In a supposed preliminary pathogenetic model, SARS-CoV-2 plays a direct role in triggering widespread microthrombosis and microvascular inflammation, because it is able to induce transient aPL, endothelial damage and complement activation at the same time. Hence, endothelium might represent the common pathway in which autoimmunity and infection converge. In addition, autoimmune phenomena in COVID-19 can be explained by regulatory T cells impairment and cytokines cascade.","Fatone, Maria Celeste",Curr Rheumatol Rev,,472

These data can help policy makers understand the concerns of these healthcare professionals. This was a survey study. On September 1st, 2020 we sent a questionnaire (using Google-forms) to all neurologists and psychiatrists in Iran via WhatsApp. The survey included three general questions (age, sex, and discipline) and six COVID-specific questions. In total, 202 physicians participated in this study (116 neurologists and 86 psychiatrists). Of the participants, 27% believed that PWE are at increased risk of contracting COVID-19. The majority (74%) of the participants would confidently recommend COVID-19 vaccine to their patients. However, only 49% of the physicians would recommend such a vaccine to all patients; others would consider it in special populations only. The overwhelming majority (91%) of the participants would recommend COVID-19 vaccine only when a reliable vaccine becomes available. Many physicians would trust a vaccine that is approved by the World Health Organization (WHO) (46%) or a vaccine that is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA-USA) (34%). Physicians have concerns on the issue of the necessity of (a future) COVID-19 vaccine in PWE. The most important concern is the reliability of a vaccine and in this regard, two health agencies, the WHO and the FDA, are the most trusted organizations to approve a vaccine against COVID-19.","Asadi-Pooya, Ali A; Sahraian, Ali; Badv, Reza Shervin; Sahraian, Mohamad Ali",Epileptic Disord,,472
352838,Does Social Capital Help to Reduce Farmland Abandonment? Evidence from Big Survey Data in Rural China,2020,"Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are of zoonotic origins, and seven distinct HCoVs are currently known to infect humans. While the four seasonal HCoVs appear to be mildly pathogenic and circulate among human populations, the other three designated SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 can cause severe diseases in some cases. The newly identified SARS-CoV-2, a causative virus of COVID-19 that can be deadly, is now spreading worldwide much more efficiently than the other two pathogenic viruses. Despite evident differences in these properties, all HCoVs commonly have an exceptionally large genomic RNA with a rather peculiar gene organization and have the potential to readily alter their biological properties. CoVs are characterized by their biological diversifications, high recombination, and efficient adaptive evolution. We are particularly concerned about the high replication and transmission nature of SARS-CoV-2, which may lead to the emergence of more transmissible and/or pathogenic viruses than ever before. Furthermore, novel variant viruses may appear at any time from the CoV pools actively circulating or persistently being maintained in the animal reservoirs, and from the CoVs in infected human individuals. In this review, we describe knowns of the CoVs and then mention their unknowns to clarify the major issues to be addressed. Genome organizations and sequences of numerous CoVs have been determined, and the viruses are presently classified into separate phylogenetic groups. Functional roles in the viral replication cycle in vitro of non-structural and structural proteins are also quite well understood or suggested. In contrast, those in the in vitro and in vivo replication for various accessory proteins encoded by the variable 3′ one-third portion of the CoV genome mostly remain to be determined. Importantly, the genomic sequences/structures closely linked to the high CoV recombination are poorly investigated and elucidated. Also, determinants for adaptation and pathogenicity have not been systematically investigated. We summarize here these research situations. Among conceivable projects, we are especially interested in the underlying molecular mechanism by which the observed CoV diversification is generated. Finally, as virologists, we discuss how we handle the present difficulties and propose possible research directions in the medium or long term.","Koma, Takaaki; Adachi, Shun; Doi, Naoya; Adachi, Akio; Nomaguchi, Masako",Front.

Here, we investigated whether pharmacological inhibition of the p110&#945; isoform of PI3K induces similar enhancement of mitochondrial function in middle-aged mice. Eight-month-old male and female mice were fed a diet containing 0.3 g/kg of the p110&#945;-selective inhibitor BYL-719 (BYL) or a vehicle diet (VEH) for 6 weeks. Mice consuming BYL-719 had higher blood glucose and insulin, and tended towards decreased body weight. After 72 h, gene expression of the mitochondrial biogenesis mediators Pgc1&#945;, Tfam and Nrf1 was greater in liver of BYL-719 males only, but unchanged in skeletal muscle of either sex. Six weeks of BYL-719 treatment did not affect mitochondrial content or function in the liver or skeletal muscle of either sex. In livers of males only, the expression of the antioxidant genes Nfe2l2, Cat, Sod1 and Sod2 increased within 72 h of BYL-719 treatment, and remained higher after 6 weeks. This was associated with an increase in hepatic GSH content and catalase protein expression, and lower H2O2 levels. Our results suggest that pharmacological inhibition of p110&#945; in adult mice does not affect liver or skeletal muscle mitochondrial function, but does show sex- and tissue-specific effects on up-regulation of antioxidant response.","Hedges, Christopher P; Pham, Toan; Shetty, Bhoopika; Masson, Stewart W C; Hickey, Anthony J R; Shepherd, Peter R; Merry, Troy L",Biosci. rep,,472

This correlation is of great importance in pregnant women affected by COVID-19, since it usually leads to the development of a serious clinical complication. In particular, managing hypertensive disorders in pregnancy can be problematic because antihypertensive medications may interact pharmacologically with drugs used to treat COVID-19. This review focuses on the safety of drug treatment for COVID-19 in pregnant women treated with antihypertensive medication. Several databases were searched to identify relevant literature. A few antihypertensive drugs and antithrombotic treatments are known for having a beneficial effect in the management of hypertension and hypertensive disorders in pregnancy. In this review, we focus on the expected drug-drug interactions with the experimental agents most often used to treat COVID-19. The current indications for the management of hypertension-related disorders in pregnancy maintain their validity, while the risk of pharmacological interaction with the currently tested anti-SARS-CoV-2 medications is relatively low.","Fogacci, Silvia; Fogacci, Federica; Favari, Elda; Toth, Peter P; Borghi, Claudio; Cicero, Arrigo F G",Eur.

356562,Coronavirus impacts on post-pandemic planned travel behaviours,2020,"Network intervention problems often benefit from selecting a highly-connected node to perform interventions using these nodes, e.g. immunization. However, in many network contexts, the structure of network connections is unknown, leading to a challenge. We develop and examine the mathematical properties of two distinct informationally light strategies, a novel global strategy and local strategy, that yield higher degree nodes in virtually any network structure. We further identify a novel network property called Inversity, whose sign determines which of the two strategies, local or global, will be most effective for a network. We demonstrate that local and global strategies obtain a several-fold improvement in node degree relative to a random selection benchmark for generated and real networks (including contact, affiliation and online networks). In some networks, they achieve a 100-fold improvement. We show how these new strategies can be used to control contagion of an epidemic spreading across a set of village networks, finding that the strategies developed here require far fewer ($<50\%$) nodes to be immunized, relative to the random strategy baseline. Prior research has typically used the complete network structure to choose nodes for optimal seeding. The relevant network is often costly to collect, and is privacy-invasive, requiring knowing each person's network neighbors, and might not be possible to obtain for time-sensitive interventions. Our interventions are less invasive of individual privacy, since each selected node only needs to nominate some network neighbors for intervention, while mathematically guaranteed to provide better connected nodes.","Kumar, Vineet; Krackhardt, David; Feld, Scott",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.08758v1.pdf,472

OBJECTIVE: Our goal is to determine the benefits and limits of using social media to understand the symptoms of patients with suspected COVID-19 with mild to moderate symptoms and, in particular, their symptoms of anosmia (loss of the sense of smell) and ageusia (loss of the sense of taste). The voluntary reports on an internet website of a membership group will be the platform of the analyses. METHODS: Posts and comments of members of an internet group known as COVID-19 Smell and Taste Loss, founded on March 24, 2020, to support patients with suspected COVID-19 were collected and analyzed daily. Demographic data were collected using the software mechanism called Group Insights on the membership group website. RESULTS: Membership groups on social media have become rare sources of support for patients with suspected COVID-19 with mild to moderate symptoms. These groups provided mental support to their members and became resources for information on COVID-19 tests and medicines or supplements. However, the membership was voluntary, and often the members leave without notification. It is hard to be precise from the free voluntary reports. The number of women in the group (6995/9227, 75.38% as of October 12, 2020) was about three times more than men (2272/9227, 24.62% as of October 12, 2020), and the peak age of members was between 20-40 years in both men and women. Patients who were asymptomatic other than the senses comprised 14.93% (53/355) of the total patients. Recovery of the senses was higher in the patients who were asymptomatic besides having anosmia and ageusia. Most (112/123, 91.06%) patients experienced other symptoms first and then lost their senses, on average, 4.2 days later. Patients without other symptoms tended to recover earlier (P=.02). Patients with anosmia and ageusia occasionally reported distorted smell and taste (parosmia and dysgeusia) as well as experiencing or perceiving the smell and taste without the sources of the smell or taste (phantosmia and phantogeusia). CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis of the social media database of suspected COVID-19 patients' voices demonstrated that, although accurate diagnosis of patients is not always obtained with social media-based analyses, it may be a useful tool to collect a large amount of data on symptoms and the clinical course of worldwide rapidly growing infectious diseases.","Koyama, Sachiko; Ueha, Rumi; Kondo, Kenji",J Med Internet Res,,472
356722,Reimagining the COVID-19 digital experience: The value of user empowerment and accessibility in risk communication,2020,"In India, the COVID-19 crisis came at a time when the focus was already on accelerating the setting up of E-courts and the digitization of justice and court administration. The journey of e-Governance initiatives in court administration started mainly in the mid-1990s and was further enhanced after enactment of the Information Technology Act 2000 (amended 2008). E-courts were launched as a part of the National e-Governance Plan (NeGP) way back in 2006. However, it appears that the sudden and unexpected advent of COVID-19 crisis has provided a greater fillip in bringing about a rapid transformation in the manner of court administration in the country. As physical appearances by lawyers and litigants were discouraged in courts due to the strict safety protocols of the COVID-19 crisis, greater use of technology, already put in place, came in handy in justice and court administration. This paper aims to broadly cover the situation in India before the COVID-19 crisis, and examine how the court administration reacted to various challenges thrown up by the COVID-19 crisis, particularly, in the period after lockdown. It will outline the major technological initiatives existing in court administration in India before the advent of the COVID-19 crisis, such as court related apps, before discussing how courts at various levels, including Lok Adalats (People’s Courts), the Supreme Court, the High Courts and the District and Subordinate Court, modified the manner of court functioning during COVID, accelerating the move towards e-Judiciary. It will then discuss some of the challenges that have been encountered, including reservations of the Bar, and major hurdles facing the court administration post-COVID 19. © 2021 The Author(s).

357017,Teacher learning management: Investigating biology teachers’ tpack to conduct learning during the covid-19 outbreak,2021,"Recently, it was confirmed that ACE2 is the receptor of SARS-CoV-2, the pathogen causing the recent outbreak of severe pneumonia around the world. It is confused that ACE2 is widely expressed across a variety of organs and is expressed moderately but not highly in lung, which, however, is the major infected organ. Therefore, we hypothesized that there could be some other genes playing key roles in the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into human cells. Here we found that AGTR2 (angiotensin II receptor type 2), a G-protein coupled receptor, has interaction with ACE2 and is highly expressed in lung with a high tissue specificity. More importantly, simulation of 3D structure based protein-protein interaction reveals that AGTR2 shows a higher binding affinity with the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 than ACE2 (energy: -8.2 vs. -5.1 [kcal/mol]). A number of compounds, biologics and traditional Chinese medicine that could decrease the expression level of AGTR2 were predicted. Finally, we suggest that AGTR2 could be a putative novel gene for the the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into human cells, which could provide different insight for the research of SARS-COV-2 proteins with their receptors.","Cui, Chunmei; Huang, Chuanbo; Zhou, Wanlu; Ji, Xiangwen; Zhang, Fenghong; Wang, Liang; Zhou, Yuan; Cui, Qinghua",IEEE/ACM trans. comput. biol. bioinform.

358142,Cover Up This Face? The Principal Takes a Stand,2021,"Purpose: Today's students have distinctive generational characteristics and increased psychopathology and generational tension. The authors investigated the negative experiences of Late Millennial students in medical school to draw implications for student support. Methods: The authors explored medical students' negative experiences using the critical incident technique. The authors conducted semi-structured in-depth interviews with 13 medical students, between February and May 2016. The authors focused on occurrences that significantly influenced medical students' school lives negatively from the students' perspective. All interviews were recorded and transcribed. The authors classified incidents into frames of reference for the use of faculty development for student support. Results: The authors extracted 22 themes from a total 334 codes and classified them into eight subcategories. Finally, four categories emerged from frames of reference. Students manipulate relationships and colluding for better specialty choice. They experience uncontrolled rifts in interpersonal relationships between peers including lawsuits, sexual assaults, and social network service conflicts. Today's students feel resentment towards dependent hierarchical relationships with seniors. They struggle with gender discrimination but perpetuate outdated gender role toward the opposite gender. Conclusion: Faculty members should understand today's students' level of career stress and desire for work life balance. They should motivate students' professional identity, promote assertiveness against unfair authorities, and focus on mental health, teamwork, and relationship building. All generations need to understand other generations and develop appropriate leadership and gender sensitivity.","Roh, HyeRin; Yune, So Jung; Park, Kwi Hwa; Lee, Geon Ho; Jung, Sung Soo; Chun, Kyung Hee",Korean j. med. educ.

358154,Using a virtual lab network testbed to facilitate real-world hands-on learning in a networking course,2021,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease of 2019) is an infectious disease outbreak later on declared as a pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2). It spreads very rapidly and can result in severe acute respiratory failure. The clinical studies have shown that advanced age and chronic diseases increase the risk of infection. However, influence of the blood groups on COVID-19 infection and its outcome remains to be confirmed. The aim of this study is to investigate whether there exists a relationship between the blood groups of the patients and risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients. MATERIAL AND METHOD: 186 patients with PCR confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 were included in this study. Age, gender, blood groups, comorbidities, need for intubation and intensive care unit follow up and mortalities of the patients were analyzed retrospectively. 1881 healthy individuals, who presented to the Hacettepe University Blood Bank served as the controls. RESULTS: The most frequently detected blood group was blood group A (57%) amongst the COVID-19 patients. This was followed by the blood group O (24.8%). The blood group types did not affect the clinical outcomes. Blood group A was statistically significantly more frequent among those infected with COVID-19 compared to controls (57% vs 38%, p <0.001; OR: 2.1). On the other hand, the frequency of blood group O was significantly lower in the COVID-19 patients, compared to the control group (24.8% vs 37.2%, p: 0.001; OR: 1.8). CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study suggest that while the blood group A might have a role in increased susceptibility to the COVID-19 infection, the blood group O might be somewhat protective. However, once infected, blood group type does not seem to influence clinical outcome.","Göker, Hakan; Aladag Karakulak, Elifcan; Demiroglu, Haluk; Ayaz Ceylan, Çaglayan Merve; Büyükasik, Yahya; Inkaya, Ahmet Çagkan; Aksu, Salih; Sayinalp, Nilgün; Haznedaroglu, Ibrahim Celalettin; Uzun, Ömrüm; Akova, Murat; Özcebe, Osman Ilhami; Ünal, Serhat",,,472

358950,A Conceptual Characterization of Value Creation in Hospitality and Tourism Firms from a Complexity Perspective,2021,"Ever since the first case was reported at the end of 2019, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the associated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a serious threat to public health globally in short time. At this point in time, there is no proven effective therapy. The interactions with concomitant disease are largely unknown, and that may be particularly pertinent to inherited arrhythmia syndrome. An arrhythmogenic effect of COVID-19 can be expected, potentially contributing to disease outcome. This may be of importance for patients with an increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias, either secondary to acquired conditions or comorbidities or consequent to inherited syndromes. Management of patients with inherited arrhythmia syndromes such as long QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome, short QT syndrome, and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic may prove particularly challenging. Depending on the inherited defect involved, these patients may be susceptible to proarrhythmic effects of COVID-19-related issues such as fever, stress, electrolyte disturbances, and use of antiviral drugs. Here, we describe the potential COVID-19-associated risks and therapeutic considerations for patients with distinct inherited arrhythmia syndromes and provide recommendations, pending local possibilities, for their monitoring and management during this pandemic.","Wu, Cheng-I; Postema, Pieter G; Arbelo, Elena; Behr, Elijah R; Bezzina, Connie R; Napolitano, Carlo; Robyns, Tomas; Probst, Vincent; Schulze-Bahr, Eric; Remme, Carol Ann; Wilde, Arthur A M",Heart Rhythm,,472

Intriguingly the receptor for SARS-CoV-2 is ACE2, a member of the angiotensin receptor family that has a relatively large tissue distribution. This observation likely explains the multitude of symptoms that have been described from human patients. The adipose tissue also expresses ACE2, suggesting that adipocytes are potentially infected by SARS-CoV-2. Here we discuss some of the potential contribution of the adipose tissue to the severity of the infection and propose some aspects of obese patients metabolic phenotyping to help stratification of individuals with high risk of severe disease.","Dugail, Isabelle; Amri, Ez-Zoubir; Vitale, Nicolas",Biochimie,,472
359232,Pakistan and India Collaboration to Improve Regional Air Quality Has Never Been More Promising,2020,"The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is impacting the way in which dental services are provided. The aim of this narrative review was twofold: to summarize key areas from the Canadian protocols available for the reopening and restructuring of dental services across the country and to critically review these protocols based on existing evidence. A narrative review of the existing Canadian protocols, written in English and French, was undertaken between April 15 and July 13, 2020. The protocols were obtained by searching through regulatory bodies and websites from professional organizations, and from personal contacts through academic institutions and policy leaders. The data extraction form focused only on protocols related to dentistry, and the information was compiled by a hired assistant. Content was categorized via group discussions with the research team on eight areas: office management and procedures, patient and staff screening, treatment procedures, office layout, risk reduction, personal protective equipment, supporting information, and length and readability. Thirteen protocols were identified and offered substantial variation in the level of details provided. All but two protocols specified proper donning/doffing of personal protective equipment, while all protocols recommended daily monitoring of COVID-19 related signs and symptoms in staff and patients. They varied in terms of recommended mask types, eye and face shield protection, and head coverings. While all protocols aimed at restructuring emergency dental services, their recommendations were often not based on the published evidence. This narrative review summarized key areas from 13 provincial and territorial protocols in Canada to help oral health care providers plan the reopening of their services. The information conveyed across all documents was clear, but variance highlights the need for a coordinated effort to develop an evidence-based document for dental practitioners.","Brondani, Mario; Cua, Denise; Maragha, Tala; Shayanfar, Melody; Mathu-Muju, Kavita; von Bergmann, HsingChi; Almeida, Fernanda; Villanueva, Jeannie; Alvarado, Alexis Armando Vides; Learey, Stephen; Donnelly, Leeann",BMC Oral Health,,472

Their analysis of the vCIES (the name given to the virtual conference) process not only provides an example of a disruption to the status quo of the institution of conferencing as a result of a global pandemic, but also extends it by addressing the multiplying concerns, urgent considerations and actions needed within academic communities for more equal and accessible conferencing in the unfolding climate catastrophe. The authors begin by discussing the challenge of academic conferencing in the age of COVID-19 and climate crisis. They highlight how their decolonial political stance (which critiques accepting Western knowledge and Western culture as the norm) and their climate-conscious approach informed their preparation of a virtual conference pilot already intended as an experimental extension to this year's on-site event. They suggest the development of this pilot provided the necessary platform for transforming the vCIES into an effective and engaging virtual experience for participants. The vCIES process, including considerations concerning its structure and format and the necessary technology, is detailed in the subsequent sections. In the final part of their article, the authors briefly identify and discuss some of the opportunities, challenges and implications emerging from their vCIES experiences. Ultimately, they suggest that in a time of instability, insecurity and uncertainty, there need to be alternatives to large on-site conferences which require excessive and extensive academic mobility. The vCIES was a step in that direction as an accessible, environmentally responsive, more equal, and intergenerational and multispecies event that welcomed families, children and pets, while opening the space for new interdisciplinary encounters.","Goebel, Janna; Manion, Caroline; Millei, Zsuzsa; Read, Robyn; Silova, Iveta",Int Rev Educ,,472

In particular, the concept of multiplex network is utilized to differentiate between social interactions that happen in households and workplaces. In addition, weak interactions among crowds, transient interactions within social gatherings, and dense human contact between foreign workers in dormitories are also taken into consideration. Such a categorization in terms of a multiplex of social network connections together with the Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) epidemic model have enabled a more precise study of the feasibility and efficacy of control measures such as social distancing, work from home, and lockdown, at different moments and stages of the pandemics. Using this model, we study an epidemic outbreak that occurs within densely populated residential areas in Singapore. Our simulations show that residents in densely populated areas could be infected easily, even though they constitute a very small fraction of the whole population. Once infection begins in these areas, disease spreading is uncontrollable if appropriate control measures are not implemented.","Chung, N N; Chew, L Y",Sci Rep,,472

This report describes the initial COVID-19 experience of the single healthcare system serving Jackson County, Mississippi. The intent of this retrospective review of COVID-19 hospitalized patients was to identify any characteristics or interventions amenable to improving care management and clinical outcomes for patients within our community hospital. METHODS: All hospitalized patients 18 years of age and older in our health system with positive tests for COVID-19 (severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 [SARS CoV-2]) by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction between March 15 and April 10, 2020 are included in this retrospective observational report. RESULTS: During the study period, 158 patients of the 1384 tested (11.4%) were positive for COVID-19 infection. Of the 158 patients, 41 (26%) were hospitalized, with 17 (41%) admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). The remaining 24 patients did not require ICU admission. The mean age of the 158 COVID-19-positive patients was 55 years (range 2-103). Obesity was noted in 68% of the hospitalized patients, including 13 (54%) of the non-ICU patients and 15 (88%) of the ICU patients. All 9 deceased patients were obese. Twelve of 17 patients received invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) and 3 patients received only high-flow nasal cannula oxygen. Only 25% (3 of 12) of the IMV patients were successfully extubated during the study period. The median duration on IMV was 17 days (range 4-35). The mortality in the 158 COVID-19-positive patients was 5.7% (9 of 158). None of the 24 non-ICU patients died. The ICU mortality rate was 53% (9 of 17). CONCLUSIONS: This report describes a community hospital experience with COVID-19. Patient outcome was comparable to that reported at larger centers. Obesity was a major comorbidity and correlated with adverse outcomes. Amidst the initial wave of COVID-19 with high demand for inpatient treatment, it is reassuring that appropriate care can be provided in a community health system.","Babar, Ijlal; Ekenna, Okechukwu; Clarkson, Maggie Ramsey; Boudreaux, Daralyn; Bennett, William; Roth, Randy",South Med J,,472

KANOPEE is a smartphone-based application, providing an interaction with a virtual agent dedicated to screen and deliver behavioral interventions to fight sleep disorders. OBJECTIVE: This paper describes the feasibility study of this application, during the context of COVID-19 confinement in France. METHODS: The virtual agent is an AI program using decision tree architecture, and interacting through natural body motion and natural voice. 2,069 users aged 18 years and over downloaded the app during the inclusion period (between 22 April and 5 May 2020). Users first answered a screening interview based on the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) that was conducted by the virtual agent. If participants were positive for insomniac complaints (ISI > 14), they could join a two-stage intervention program: a) complete an electronic sleep diary for one week, and b) follow personalized sleep recommendations for 10 days. Measures collected included socio-demographic information, ISI and sleep/wake schedules; and acceptance and trust of the agent. RESULTS: 80% of users who downloaded the app (N=1,574) completed the screening interview with the virtual agent. The virtual agent was well accepted by the 431 users who answered acceptance and trust questionnaires, regarding its usability, satisfaction, benevolence, and credibility. Of the 773 screened subjects who reported sleep complaints (ISI>14), 166 of them followed the first step of the intervention (21.5%). Of these, 47 (28.3%) followed the second step. Users who completed step one found that their insomnia complaints (mean scores: baseline ISI: 18.56; ISI after step one: 15.99; P<.001) and nocturnal sleep improved significantly after one week. Subjects who completed step 2 also showed an improvement compared to the initial measure (mean scores: baseline ISI: 18.87; ISI after step two: 14.68; P<.001). The most severely affected subjects (ISI >21) did not respond to either intervention. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary results suggest that KANOPEE is a promising solution to screen populations for sleep complaints, and that it provides acceptable and practical behavioral advice for subjects reporting moderately severe insomnia.","Philip, Pierre; Dupuy, Lucile; Morin, Charles M; de Sevin, Etienne; Bioulac, Stéphanie; Taillard, Jacques; Serre, Fuschia; Auriacombe, Marc; Micoulaud-Franchi, Jean-Arthur",J. med. internet res,,472
366931,The Hidden Shadow of Coronavirus on Education in Developing Countries,2021,"SARS-CoV-2 infection can have widely diverse clinical outcomes, from asymptomatic infection to death, with many possible clinical symptoms and syndromes. It is thus essential to understand how the virus interacts with the host immune system to bring about these varied outcomes and to inform vaccine development. We now know that both antibody and T cell responses are induced in the majority of infected individuals, and that cross-reactive responses from other coronaviruses also exist in the uninfected population. Innate immune responses are a key focus of research and may influence the course of disease and the character of subsequent adaptive responses. Finally, baseline immune profiles and changes during early acute infection may be key to predicting the course of disease. Understanding all these aspects can help to create better immune monitoring tools for COVID-19, including tools for predicting disease severity or specific sequelae, perhaps even prior to infection.","Maecker, Holden T",J. immunotherap. cancer,,472

The virus belongs to the ß genus Coronavirus in the family Corornaviridae, and is closely related to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, causing severe symptoms of pneumonia. The virus is transmitted through droplets, close contact, and other means, and patients in the incubation period could potentially transmit the virus to other persons. According to current observations, 2019-nCoV is weaker than SARS in pathogenesis, but has stronger transmission competence; it's mechanism of cross-species spread might be related with angiotensin-converting enzyme â ¡ (ACE2), which is consistent with the receptor SARS-CoV. After the outbreak of this disease, Chinese scientists invested a lot of energy to carry out research by developing rapid diagnostic reagents, identifying the characters of the pathogen, screening out clinical drugs that may inhibit the virus, and are rapidly developing vaccines. The emergence of 2019-nCoV reminds us once again of the importance of establishing a systematic coronavirus surveillance network. It also poses new challenges to prevention and control of the emerging epidemic and rapidly responses on scientific research.","Tian, H Y",Zhonghua Yu Fang Yi Xue Za Zhi,,472

The purpose of this study is to find out the positive and negative impacts of the pandemic on surgical residency programs and on the lives of surgical residents. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 112 surgical residents of a tertiary care hospital in Pakistan, with a mean age of 30.5 years from all the departments of surgery using a self-made, validated 40-point questionnaire comprising three sections. The last section also included modified Maslach Burnout inventory. RESULTS: Of all the residents, 97 (86.6%) stated that their surgical hands-on duration is adversely affected by the pandemic. As for clinical exposure, 92 (82.1%) trainees responded that their clinical exposure is affected too. Among all the subjects, 69 (61%) were concerned about transmitting it to their family members and 43 (38.4%) affirmed on being afraid of dying because of their direct exposure. On the brighter side, the average number of working hours per week for surgical residents were reduced from 81.10 ± 6.21 to 49.16 ± 6.25 (p < 0.001) due to the outbreak. Modified Maslach Burnout inventory score was 8.33 ± 2.34 after the outbreak, showing statistically significant reduction in burnout among the surgical residents (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The changes in the surgical residency programs amidst the pandemic has reduced the working hours, hands-on and clinical exposure of the surgical residents. Moreover, the situation has provided an opportunity to explore efficient methods of learning that can lead to lesser burnout. However, psychological burdens of surgical residents like fear of acquiring the infection should be appropriately addressed.","Osama, Muhammad; Zaheer, Farhan; Saeed, Hasham; Anees, Khadija; Jawed, Qirat; Syed, Sohaib Hasan; Sheikh, Bashir A",Int J Surg,,472

METHODS: In this study, we propose to generate a more accurate diagnosis model of COVID-19 based on patient symptoms and routine test results by applying machine learning to reanalyzing COVID-19 data from 151 published studies. We aim to investigate correlations between clinical variables, cluster COVID-19 patients into subtypes, and generate a computational classification model for discriminating between COVID-19 patients and influenza patients based on clinical variables alone. RESULTS: We discovered several novel associations between clinical variables, including correlations between being male and having higher levels of serum lymphocytes and neutrophils. We found that COVID-19 patients could be clustered into subtypes based on serum levels of immune cells, gender, and reported symptoms. Finally, we trained an XGBoost model to achieve a sensitivity of 92.5% and a specificity of 97.9% in discriminating COVID-19 patients from influenza patients. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that computational methods trained on large clinical datasets could yield ever more accurate COVID-19 diagnostic models to mitigate the impact of lack of testing.

Rheumatic patients are required to engage in effective health management but their behavior is often influenced by intrinsic and extrinsic factors. This cross-sectional study aims to examine patients' experiences during the current pandemic and its implication on their health perception and behavior. METHOD: A patient-centered electronic survey was used, randomly sampling rheumatic patients in Saudi Arabia during March and April 2020. Questions included patients' socio-demographics, diseases, medications, COVID-19 knowledge, source of information, fear level, disease activity perception, health care utilization, medication accessibility, and therapeutic compliance (measured using a modified version of Medication Adherence Reporting Scale). Correlation and regression coefficients were used to evaluate associations among the aforementioned variables. RESULTS: A total of 637 respondents were included. The majority were rheumatoid arthritis patients (42.7%). Patients' knowledge about COVID-19 was correlated with social media use (P = .012). Fear of COVID-19 infection correlated with healthcare facility for follow-up visits (P = .024) and fear of disease deterioration if contracting the infection correlated with patients' levels of knowledge (P = .035). Both types of fear did not correlate with patients' perceptions of disease activity. However, patients' perceptions of worsened disease activity were correlated with unplanned healthcare visits (P < .001), medication non-adherence, and difficulty accessing medication (P = .010 and .006, respectively). CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic and surrounding public health measures could affect rheumatic patients' health management which might contribute to disease flare-up and subsequently taxing healthcare systems even further.","Hassen, Lena Mostafa; Almaghlouth, Ibrahim A; Hassen, Ikhlass Mostafa; Daghestani, Maha H; Almohisen, Amal A; Alqurtas, Eman M; Alkhalaf, Abdulaziz; Bedaiwi, Mohammed K; Omair, Mohammed A; Almogairen, Sultan M; Alarfaj, Hussein F; Alarfaj, Abdulrahman S",Int J Rheum Dis,,472
377273,Similarities and differences in international and comparative human resource management: A review of 60 years of research,2020,"BACKGROUND: Mathematical modelling of infectious diseases is a powerful tool for the design of management policies and a fundamental part of the arsenal currently deployed to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We present a compartmental model for the disease where symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals move separately. We introduced healthcare burden parameters allowing to infer possible containment and suppression strategies. In addition, the model was scaled up to describe different interconnected areas, giving the possibility to trigger regionalized measures. It was specially adjusted to Mendoza-Argentina's parameters, but is easily adaptable for elsewhere. RESULTS: Overall, the simulations we carried out were notably more effective when mitigation measures were not relaxed in between the suppressive actions. Since asymptomatics or very mildly affected patients are the vast majority, we studied the impact of detecting and isolating them. The removal of asymptomatics from the infectious pool remarkably lowered the effective reproduction number, healthcare burden and overall fatality. Furthermore, different suppression triggers regarding ICU occupancy were attempted. The best scenario was found to be the combination of ICU occupancy triggers (on: 50%, off: 30%) with the detection and isolation of asymptomatic individuals. In the ideal assumption that 45% of the asymptomatics could be detected and isolated, there would be no need for complete lockdown, and Mendoza's healthcare system would not collapse. CONCLUSIONS: Our model and its analysis inform that the detection and isolation of all infected individuals, without leaving aside the asymptomatic group is the key to surpass this pandemic.","Mayorga, Lía; García Samartino, Clara; Flores, Gabriel; Masuelli, Sofía; Sánchez, María V; Mayorga, Luis S; Sánchez, Cristián G",BMC Public Health,,472
377370,Revisiting online learner engagement: exploring the role of learner characteristics in an emergency period,2021,"The UK government has put lateral flow antigen tests (LFATs) at the forefront of its strategy to scale-up testing in the coronavirus pandemic. However, evidence from a pilot trial using an LFAT to identify asymptomatic infections in the community suggested that the test missed over half of the positive cases in the tested population. This raises the question of whether it can be ethical to use an inaccurate test to guide public health measures. We begin by explicating different dimensions of test accuracy (sensitivity, specificity and predictive value), and why they matter morally, before highlighting key data from the Liverpool pilot. We argue that the poor sensitivity of the LFAT in this pilot trial suggests that there are important limitations to what we can expect these tests to achieve. A test with low sensitivity will provide false-negative results, and in doing so generate the risk of false assurance and its attendant moral costs. However, we also suggest that the deployment of an insensitive but specific test could identify many asymptomatic carriers of the virus who are currently being missed under existing arrangements. Having outlined ways in which the costs of false reassurance could potentially be mitigated, we conclude that the use of an insensitive LFAT in mass testing may be ethical if (1) it is used predominantly to identify positive cases, (2) it is a cost-effective method of achieving that goal and (3) if other public health tools can effectively prevent widespread false reassurance.","Pugh, Jonathan; Wilkinson, Dominic; Savulescu, Julian",J. med. ethics,,472

Pre-existing comorbidities have been found to have a dramatic effect on the disease course. We sought to analyze the effect of asthma on the disease progression and outcomes of COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We conducted a multi-center retrospective study of positively confirmed COVID-19 patients. The primary outcome of interest was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission, intubation, mechanical ventilation, and length of hospital stay. RESULTS: A total of 502 COVID-19 adult patients (72 asthma and 430 non-asthma cohorts) with mean age of 60.7 years were included in the study. The frequency of asthma in hospitalized cohorts was 14.3%. Univariate analysis revealed that asthma patients were more likely to be obese (75% versus 54.2%, p = 0.001), with a higher frequency of intubation (40.3% versus 27.8%, p = 0.036), and required a longer duration of hospitalization (15.1 ± 12.5 versus 11.5 ± 10.6, p = 0.015). After adjustment, multivariable analysis showed that asthmatic patients were not associated with higher risk of ICU admission (OR = 1.81, 95%CI = 0.98-3.09, p = 0.06), endotracheal intubation (OR = 1.77, 95%CI = 0.99-3.04, p = 0.06) or complications (OR = 1.37, 95%CI = 0.82-2.31, p = 0.23). Asthmatic patients were not associated with higher odds of prolonged hospital length of stay (OR = 1.48, 95%CI = 0.82-2.66, p = 0.20) or with ICU stay (OR = 0.76, 95%CI = 0.28-2.02, p = 0.58). Kaplan-Meier curve showed no significant difference in the overall survival of the two groups (p = 0.65). CONCLUSION: Despite the increased prevalence of hospitalization in elder asthmatic COVID-19 patients, after adjustment for other variables, it was neither associated with increased severity nor worse outcomes.","Hussein, Mohammad H; Toraih, Eman A; Attia, Abdallah S; Burley, Nicholas; Zhang, Allen D; Roos, Jackson; Houghton, August; Aniemeka, Nedum; Omar, Mahmoud; Aboueisha, Mohamed; Shama, Mohamed A; Duchesne, Juan; Kandil, Emad",Respir Med,,472

While Shenzhen did not implement a citywide lockdown like Wuhan, it did put into place a rapid response system first developed after the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003. In the wake of the 2003 SARS outbreak, Shenzhen health authority created a network for surveillance and responding to novel respiratory infections, including pneumonia of unknown causes (PUC). The network rapidly detected mass discussion about PUC and immediately deployed emergency preparedness, quarantine for close contacts of PUC. Five early actions (early detection, early reporting, early diagnosis, early isolation, and early treatment) and four centralized responses (centralized coordination by experts, centralized allocation of resources, centralized placement of patients, and centralized provision of treatment) ensured effective prevention and control. Tripartite working teams comprising community cadres, medical personnel and police were formulated to conduct contact tracing at each neighborhood and residential community. Incorporation of mobile technology, big data, and artificial intelligence into COVID-19 response increased accessibility to health services, reduced misinformation and minimized the impact of fake news. Shenzhen's unique experience in successfully controlling the COVID-19 outbreak may be a useful model for countries and regions currently experiencing rapid spread of the virus.","Zou, Huachun; Shu, Yuelong; Feng, Tiejian",Infect Dis Poverty,,472

However, even among developed nations, access to TAVI is not uniform. The Valve for Life initiative was launched by the European Association of Percutaneous Cardiovascular Interventions in 2015 with the objective of improving access to transcatheter valve interventions across Europe. The UK has been identified as a country with low penetration of these procedures and has been selected as the fourth nation to be included in the initiative. Specifically, the number of TAVI procedures carried out in the UK is significantly lower than almost all other European nations. Furthermore, there is substantial geographical inequity in access to TAVI within the UK. As a consequence of this underprovision, waiting times for TAVI are long, and mortality among those waiting intervention is significant. This article reviews these issues, reports new data on access to TAVI in the UK and presents the proposals of the UK Valve for Life team to address the current problems in association with the British Cardiovascular Intervention Society.","Ali, Noman; Faour, Amir; Rawlins, John; Dawkins, Sam; Appleby, Clare E; MacCarthy, Philip; Byrne, Jonathan; Trivedi, Uday; Curzen, Nick; Banning, Adrian P; Ludman, Peter; Blackman, Daniel J",,,472

METHODS: Retrospective analysis of contact tracing data of infected HCWs was done from March 1, 2020 to July 31, 2020 at a tertiary care center in New Delhi, India. Contacts were categorized according to the nature of contact and followed for 14 days. RESULTS: Qualitative RT-PCR testing was performed on 106 HCWs (from a total of 257) owing to exposure or development of symptoms. Positive results were found in 16 HCWs (6.2%) who were exposed to 120 other HCWs, generating 197 exposure incidents. Of these, 30 (15.2%) exposure incidents were high risk with multiple exposures in 48 (40.0%) HCWs. Exposure to infected HCWs was noted in 3 (18.8%) of 16 positive cases. Of the 197 exposure incidents, 54 (27.4%) were deemed avoidable exposures. Infection prevention and control policies were periodically reviewed, and the department implemented mitigating steps to minimize the risk to healthcare providers. CONCLUSION: Instituting appropriate infection prevention and control policies and use of adequate precautions by HCWs is vital to minimize high-risk exposure to COVID-19.","Mansoor, Sadia; Sharma, K Aparna; Ranjan, Piyush; Singhal, Seema; Meena, Jyoti; Kumari, Rajesh; Rana, Anubhuti; Kumari, Archana; Varun, Neha; Kumari, Sarita; Kumar, Sunesh; Bhatla, Neerja",Int J Gynaecol Obstet,,472

We show that a more informative ex-post environment is never desirable for a regret averse individual. We then suppose that there are multiple regret averse individuals where the ex-post information available depends on own choice and the choices of others. This implies that what appears to be a series of isolated decision problems is in fact a behavioural game with multiple equilibria.

METHODS: All patients underwent real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), lung ultrasound (LUS) and clinical evaluation on the same day. In each of the 12 areas evaluated in the LUS, the LUS signs were scored to generate the aeration score. RESULTS: A total of 409 participants had positive PCR, with a median age of 41 (35-51) years. All participants had clinical symptoms, with cough in 84.1%, fever in 69.7%, and dyspnea in 36.2% of cases. In the LUS, 72.6% of participants had B-lines >2, 36.2% had coalescent B-lines, and 8.06% had subpleural consolidations. The median aeration score was 3 (2-7). The aeration score differed significantly regarding the presence of cough (P = .002), fever (P = .001), and dyspnea (P < .0001). The finding of subpleural consolidations in the LUS showed significant differences between participants with or without dyspnea (P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: In healthcare professionals with COVID-19, LUS plays a key role in the characterization of lung involvement.

Vitamin D deficiency has been postulated as a determinant of severity. OBJECTIVES: To review the evidence relevant to vitamin D and COVID-19. METHODS: Narrative review. RESULTS: Regression modelling shows that more northerly countries in the Northern Hemisphere are currently (May 2020) showing relatively high COVID-19 mortality, with an estimated 4.4% increase in mortality for each 1 degree latitude north of 28 degrees North (P = 0.031) after adjustment for age of population. This supports a role for ultraviolet B acting via vitamin D synthesis. Factors associated with worse COVID-19 prognosis include old age, ethnicity, male sex, obesity, diabetes and hypertension and these also associate with deficiency of vitamin D or its response. Vitamin D deficiency is also linked to severity of childhood respiratory illness. Experimentally, vitamin D increases the ratio of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to ACE, thus increasing angiotensin II hydrolysis and reducing subsequent inflammatory cytokine response to pathogens and lung injury. CONCLUSIONS: Substantial evidence supports a link between vitamin D deficiency and COVID-19 severity but it is all indirect. Community-based placebo-controlled trials of vitamin D supplementation may be difficult. Further evidence could come from study of COVID-19 outcomes in large cohorts with information on prescribing data for vitamin D supplementation or assay of serum unbound 25(OH) vitamin D levels. Meanwhile, vitamin D supplementation should be strongly advised for people likely to be deficient.","Rhodes, J M; Subramanian, S; Laird, E; Griffin, G; Kenny, R A",J Intern Med,,472
389213,An Explainable Artificial Intelligence Model for Detecting COVID-19 with Twitter Text Classification: Turkey Case,2021,"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has led to a devastating effect on the global public health. Computed Tomography (CT) is an effective tool in the screening of COVID-19. It is of great importance to rapidly and accurately segment COVID-19 from CT to help diagnostic and patient monitoring. In this paper, we propose a U-Net based segmentation network using attention mechanism. As not all the features extracted from the encoders are useful for segmentation, we propose to incorporate an attention mechanism including a spatial attention module and a channel attention module, to a U-Net architecture to re-weight the feature representation spatially and channel-wise to capture rich contextual relationships for better feature representation. In addition, the focal Tversky loss is introduced to deal with small lesion segmentation. The experiment results, evaluated on a COVID-19 CT segmentation dataset where 473 CT slices are available, demonstrate the proposed method can achieve an accurate and rapid segmentation result on COVID-19. The method takes only 0.29 second to segment a single CT slice. The obtained Dice Score and Hausdorff Distance are 83.1% and 18.8, respectively.","Zhou, Tongxue; Canu, Stéphane; Ruan, Su",,,472

393574,Distributing participation in design: Addressing challenges of a global pandemic,2021,"Foundation of Applied Mathematics is one of the mathematics servicing courses for Diploma of Applied Science programme in Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM), Malaysia. This course was previously taught in a physical classroom using direct confrontation. A few negative factors were found to contribute to the course’s failure rate: i) inadequate exercises, ii) poor study habit and iii) reluctance to consult the lecturer or opting to study with peers only. Due to the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, the students are forced to do independent learning at home. Ascribable to this issue, the lecturers were inspired to investigate their students’ motivation and participation in this course, which associate to their self-regulated learning (SRL). This paper presents the implementation of open and distance learning (ODL) in teaching the subject of Foundation of Applied Mathematics. The ODL was intended to promote SRL for student, thereby increasing their motivation and participation in learning activities. At present, no literature has been found study on SRL in current ODL method, mainly for this course. Online questionnaires were collected at the end of March - July 2020 academic semester to investigate students’ perceptions on ODL and its effects to Self-Regulated Learning (SRL). Descriptive analysis was used to analyze the data. The findings indicated that the level of agreement for ODL has positive contributions to the students’ SRL. © 2021 Karadeniz Technical University.

394457,The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Information Systems Management,2020,"The aim of this editorial is to illustrate the new public funding framework of the Italian National Health System following the Covid-19 pandemic. The document reviews the measures put in place by the Italian Government and European Institutions such as the European Commission (EC), the European Central Bank (ECB) and the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) to deal with this health crisis and subsequent severe economic recession, with particular reference to sources and uses of resources. The use of new budgetary financial spaces in deficit entails greater attention to the assessment of interventions and makes it necessary to keep expenditure under strict control. At the same time, the remodeling of expenditure within its aggregates, public investment in innovation, and the removal of administrative obstacles can strengthen the capacity of the healthcare system to meet the extraordinary needs deriving from the spread of Covid-19 and its resilience to future health shocks.","Spampinato, Luigi",,,472
394524,Cities under pressure: strategies and tools to face climate change and pandemic,2020,"Case fatality risk (CFR) is the probability of death among cases of a disease. A crude CFR estimate is the ratio of the number deaths to the number of cases of the disease. This estimate is biased, however, particularly during outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases such as COVID-19, because the death time of recent cases is subject to right censoring. Instead, we propose deconvolution methods applied to routinely collected surveillance data of unlinked case and death counts over time. We begin by considering the death series to be the convolution of the case series and the fatality distribution, which is the subdistribution of the time between diagnosis and death. We then use deconvolution methods to estimate this fatality distribution. This provides a CFR estimate together with information about the distribution of time to death. Importantly, this information is extracted without the need to make strong assumptions used in previous analyses. The methods are applied to COVID-19 surveillance data from a range of countries illustrating substantial CFR differences. Simulations show that crude approaches lead to underestimation, particularly early in an outbreak, and that the proposed approach can rectify this bias. An R package called covidSurv is available for implementing the analyses.

Based on 237 cases, by using epidemiological retrospective statistics, data visualization, and social network analysis methods, this paper summarized characteristics of patients with COVID-19 in Shaanxi, China, and analyzed these patients' dynamic contact network structure. The study found that there are many clustered infections through strong ties, about one-third of cases are caused by relatives' infection. In early stages of the epidemic, imported cases were the most, and in the later stages, local infection cases were the most. The infected people were mostly middle-aged men. Symptoms of imported cases occurred on average of 3 days after they arrived, and medical measures were taken 5 days later on average. All cases showed symptoms in less than 2 days on average and were then taken to medical treatment. The contact network can be divided into multiple disconnected components. The largest component has 12 patients. The average degree centrality in the network is 0.987, average betweenness degree is 0, average closeness degree is 0.452, and average PageRank index is 0.0042. The number of contacts of patients is unevenly distributed in the network.","Yang, Zhangbo",Sci Rep,,472

396579,COVID-19: A Crisis or a Springboard,2020,"We describe a general method that allows structure determination of small proteins by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). The method is based on the availability of a target-binding nanobody, which is then rigidly attached to two scaffolds: (1) a Fab-fragment of an antibody directed against the nanobody, and (2) a nanobody-binding protein A fragment fused to maltose binding protein and Fab-binding domains. The overall ensemble of [~]120 kDa, called Legobody, does not perturb the nanobody-target interaction and facilitates particle alignment in cryo-EM image processing. The utility of the method is demonstrated for the KDEL receptor, a 23 kDa membrane protein, resulting in a map at 3.2[A] overall resolution with density sufficient for de novo model building, and for the 22 kDa RBD of SARS-CoV2 spike protein, resulting in a map at 3.6 [A] resolution that allows analysis of the binding interface to the nanobody. The Legobody approach thus overcomes the current size limitations of cryo-EM analysis.","Wu, Xudong; Rapoport, Tom A",,,472
396760,Challenges in Teaching Organic Chemistry Remotely,2020,"BACKGROUND: Tobacco use disorder is a leading threat to the health of persons with HIV (PWH) on antiretroviral treatment and identifying optimal treatment approaches to promote abstinence is critical. We describe the rationale, aims, and design for a new study, ""A SMART Approach to Treating Tobacco Use Disorder in Persons with HIV (SMARTTT),"" a sequential multiple assignment randomized trial. METHODS: In HIV clinics within three health systems in the northeastern United States, PWH with tobacco use disorder are randomized to nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) with or without contingency management (NRT vs. NRTâ¯+â¯CM). Participants with response (defined as exhaled carbon monoxide (eCO)-confirmed smoking abstinence at week 12), continue the same treatment for another 12â¯weeks. Participants with non-response, are re-randomized to either switch medications from NRT to varenicline or intensify treatment to a higher CM reward schedule. Interventions are delivered by clinical pharmacists embedded in HIV clinics. The primary outcome is eCO-confirmed smoking abstinence; secondary outcomes include CD4 cell count, HIV viral load suppression, and the Veterans Aging Cohort Study (VACS) Index 2.0 score (a validated measure of morbidity and mortality based on laboratory data). Consistent with a hybrid type 1 effectiveness-implementation design and grounded in implementation science frameworks, we will conduct an implementation-focused process evaluation in parallel. Study protocol adaptations related to the COVID-19 pandemic have been made. CONCLUSIONS: SMARTTT is expected to generate novel findings regarding the impact, cost, and implementation of an adaptive clinical pharmacist-delivered intervention involving medications and CM to promote smoking abstinence among PWH.

397209,"Political, Scientific and Management Aspects of Coronavirus Pandemics: Considerations from Azerbaijan Perspective",2020,"Research on belief in conspiracy theories identified many predictors but often failed to investigate them together. In the present study, we tested how the most important predictors of beliefs in conspiracy theories explain endorsing COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 conspiracy theories and conspiracy mentality. Apart from these three measures of conspiratorial thinking, participants (N = 354) completed several measures of epistemic, existential, and social psychological motives, as well as cognitive processing variables. While many predictors had significant correlations, only three consistently explained conspiratorial beliefs when included in one model: higher spirituality (specifically eco-awareness factor), higher narcissism, and lower analytical thinking. Compared to the other two conspiratorial measures, predictors less explained belief in COVID-19 conspiracy theories, but this depended on items' content. We conclude that the same predictors apply to belief in both COVID and non-COVID conspiracies and identify New Age spirituality as an important contributor to such beliefs.","Gligoric, Vukasin; da Silva, Margarida Moreira; Eker, Selin; van Hoek, Nieke; Nieuwenhuijzen, Ella; Popova, Uljana; Zeighami, Golnar",Appl. cogn. psychol,,472

At a safety net health system in Massachusetts, 11 534 adults were retrospectively followed within 3 months of the COVID-19 lockdown. Chi-square and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were reported for categorical and continues variables, respectively. Multivariate analyses were performed to identify factors associated with weight gain (&#8805;0.01 kg and 5%). During the lockdown period, greater proportion of women gained weight compared to men (46.1% vs 40.6%, P < .01). The obesity rate after the lockdown increased among women (40.7%-41.7, P < .01) but decreased among men (39.6%-38.6, P < .01) compared to before the lockdown. Post-lockdown obesity rates increased among Haitian (51.2%-55.0%, P < .01) and Hispanic women (50.7%-51.8%, P < .01). More than 5% weight gain was associated with 18 to 39 vs &#8805;60 years of age (OR = 1.45, 95% CI = 1.07, 1.97), food and housing insecurity (OR = 1.44, 95% CI = 1.05, 1.97) and tobacco use (OR = 1.38, 95% CI = 1.07, 1.78) among men; and 18 to 39 vs &#8805;60 years of age (OR = 1.55, 95% CI = 1.25, 1.91), Hispanics (OR = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.01, 1.54), Brazilians (OR = 1.22, 95% CI = 1.03, 1.45), and tobacco use (OR = 1.36, 95% CI = 1.10, 1.69) among women.

397733,Formation of Professional Competences and Soft Skills of Public Administration Employees for Sustainable Professional Development,2021,"Importance: It has been hypothesized that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs)/angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) may make patients more susceptible to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and to worse outcomes through upregulation of the functional receptor of the virus, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. Objective: To examine whether use of ACEI/ARBs was associated with COVID-19 diagnosis and worse outcomes in patients with COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: To examine outcomes among patients with COVID-19, a retrospective cohort study using data from Danish national administrative registries was conducted. Patients with COVID-19 from February 22 to May 4, 2020, were identified using ICD-10 codes and followed up from day of diagnosis to outcome or end of study period (May 4, 2020). To examine susceptibility to COVID-19, a Cox regression model with a nested case-control framework was used to examine the association between use of ACEI/ARBs vs other antihypertensive drugs and the incidence rate of a COVID-19 diagnosis in a cohort of patients with hypertension from February 1 to May 4, 2020. Exposures: ACEI/ARB use was defined as prescription fillings 6 months prior to the index date. Main Outcomes and Measures: In the retrospective cohort study, the primary outcome was death, and a secondary outcome was a composite outcome of death or severe COVID-19. In the nested case-control susceptibility analysis, the outcome was COVID-19 diagnosis. Results: In the retrospective cohort study, 4480 patients with COVID-19 were included (median age, 54.7 years [interquartile range, 40.9-72.0]; 47.9% men). There were 895 users (20.0%) of ACEI/ARBs and 3585 nonusers (80.0%). In the ACEI/ARB group, 18.1% died within 30 days vs 7.3% in the nonuser group, but this association was not significant after adjustment for age, sex, and medical history (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.83 [95% CI, 0.67-1.03]). Death or severe COVID-19 occurred in 31.9% of ACEI/ARB users vs 14.2% of nonusers by 30 days (adjusted HR, 1.04 [95% CI, 0.89-1.23]). In the nested case-control analysis of COVID-19 susceptibility, 571 patients with COVID-19 and prior hypertension (median age, 73.9 years; 54.3% men) were compared with 5710 age- and sex-matched controls with prior hypertension but not COVID-19. Among those with COVID-19, 86.5% used ACEI/ARBs vs 85.4% of controls; ACEI/ARB use compared with other antihypertensive drugs was not significantly associated with higher incidence of COVID-19 (adjusted HR, 1.05 [95% CI, 0.80-1.36]). Conclusions and Relevance: Prior use of ACEI/ARBs was not significantly associated with COVID-19 diagnosis among patients with hypertension or with mortality or severe disease among patients diagnosed as having COVID-19. These findings do not support discontinuation of ACEI/ARB medications that are clinically indicated in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Fosbøl, Emil L; Butt, Jawad H; Østergaard, Lauge; Andersson, Charlotte; Selmer, Christian; Kragholm, Kristian; Schou, Morten; Phelps, Matthew; Gislason, Gunnar H; Gerds, Thomas A; Torp-Pedersen, Christian; Køber, Lars",JAMA,,472

However, many people wear them incorrectly. This observation prompts us to devise an automated approach to monitor the condition of people wearing masks. Unlike previous studies, our work goes beyond mask detection; it focuses on generating a personalized demonstration on proper mask-wearing, which helps people use masks better through visual demonstration rather than text explanation. The pipeline starts from the detection of face covering. For images where faces are improperly covered, our mask overlay module incorporates statistical shape analysis (SSA) and dense landmark alignment to approximate the geometry of a face and generates corresponding face-covering examples. Our results show that the proposed system successfully identifies images with faces covered properly. Our ablation study on mask overlay suggests that the SSA model helps to address variations in face shapes, orientations, and scales. The final face-covering examples, especially half profile face images, surpass previous arts by a noticeable margin.","Hu, Yixin; Li, Xingyu",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.10430v1.pdf,472
398929,The Negotiations for a New Implementing Agreement under the Un Convention on the Law of the Sea concerning Marine Biodiversity,2020,"BACKGROUND: To design better measures to contain the Covid-19 epidemics, it is relevant to know whether socioeconomic factors are associated with a higher risk of death by Covid-19. This work estimates the effects of individual socioeconomic characteristics on the risk of death by Covid-19. METHODS: Logistic models were estimated to assess the effect of socioeconomic characteristics (income, race/ethnicity, schooling, occupation and economic activity) on the risk of death from Covid-19. For this purpose, Covid-19 individual death records in Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil were combined with the Annual Register of Social Information, which contains socioeconomic information about formal workers. FINDINGS: Workers employed in establishments in the health and public safety sectors present a risk of dying 2.46 and 2.25 times higher than those employed in other activities. Non-white people, men, and those who work in the Metropolitan Region are also more likely to die from Covid-19. People with higher education are 44% less likely to die from the disease. CONCLUSIONS: Some population groups are more vulnerable to the Covid-19 pandemic and individual socioeconomic conditions play a relevant role in the probability of death by the disease. That should be considered in the design of prevention policies to be adopted.","De Negri, F; Galiezz, R; Miranda, P; Koeller, P; Zucoloto, G; Costa, J; Farias, C M; Travassos, G H; Medronho, R A",J. public health (Oxf),,472

Due to lack of resources and high risk of death, most cancer patients have been shifted to non-surgical treatments. The following reports our experience of a Gynaecologic Oncology Unit's reallocation of resources in a COVID-19 free surgical oncologic hub in order to guarantee standard quality of surgical activities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a prospective observational study performed in the Gynaecologic Oncology Unit, on the outcomes of the reallocation of surgical activities outside the University Hospital of Bologna, Italy, during the Italian lockdown period. Here, we described our COVID-19 free surgical oncologic pathway, in terms of lifestyle restrictions, COVID-19 screening measures, and patient clinical, surgical and follow up outcomes. RESULTS: During the lockdown period (March 9th - May 4th, 2020), 83 patients were scheduled for oncological surgery, 51 patients underwent surgery. Compared to pre-COVID period, we performed the same activities: number of cases scheduled for surgery, type of surgery and surgical and oncological results. No cases of COVID-19 infection were recorded in operated patients and in medical staff. Patients were compliant and well accepted the lifestyle restrictions and reorganization of the care. CONCLUSIONSONCLUSIONS: Our experience showed that the prioritization of oncological surgical care and the allocation of resources during a pandemic in COVID-19 free surgical hubs is an appropriate choice to guarantee oncological protocols.","Perrone, Anna M; Dondi, Giulia; Giunchi, Susanna; De Crescenzo, Eugenia; Boussedra, Safia; Tesei, Marco; D039,; Andrea, Rocco; De Leo, Antonio; Zamagni, Claudio; Morganti, Alessio G; De Palma, Alessandra; De Iaco, Pierandrea",Gynecol. oncol,,472
399708,Online learning accessibility during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"The recent global COVID-19 public health emergency is caused by SARS-CoV-2 infections and can manifest extremely variable clinical symptoms. Host human genetic variability could influence susceptibility and response to infection. It is known that ACE2 acts as a receptor for this pathogen, but the viral entry into the target cell also depends on other proteins. The aim of this study was to investigate the variability of genes coding for these proteins involved in the SARS-CoV-2 entry into the cells. We analyzed 131 COVID-19 patients by exome sequencing and examined the genetic variants of TMPRSS2, PCSK3, DPP4, and BSG genes. In total we identified seventeen variants. In PCSK3 gene, we observed a missense variant (c.893G>A) statistically more frequent compared to the EUR GnomAD reference population and a missense mutation (c.1906A>G) not found in the GnomAD database. In TMPRSS2 gene, we observed a significant difference in the frequency of c.331G>A, c.23G>T, and c.589G>A variant alleles in COVID-19 patients, compared to the corresponding allelic frequency in GnomAD. Genetic variants in these genes could influence the entry of the SARS-CoV-2. These data also support the hypothesis that host genetic variability may contribute to the variability in infection susceptibility and severity.","Latini, Andrea; Agolini, Emanuele; Novelli, Antonio; Borgiani, Paola; Giannini, Rosalinda; Gravina, Paolo; Smarrazzo, Andrea; Dauri, Mario; Andreoni, Massimo; Rogliani, Paola; Bernardini, Sergio; Helmer-Citterich, Manuela; Biancolella, Michela; Novelli, Giuseppe",,,472

The paper examines the impact of government restrictive measures on the spread and effects of COVID-19. The work is devoted to the improvement of recommendation rules based on novel ensemble of machine learning methods such as regression tree and clustering. The dynamics of migration between countries in clusters, and their relationship with the number of confirmed cases and the percentage of deaths caused by COVID-19, were studied on the example of Poland, Italy and Germany. It is shown that there is a clear relationship between the cluster number and the number of new cases of diseases and death. It has also been shown that different countries' policies to prevent the disease, in particular the timing of restrictive measures, correlate with the dynamics of the spread of COVID-19 and the consequences of the disease. For example, the results show a clear proactive tactic of restrictive measures by example of Germany, and catching up on the spread of the disease by example of Italy. A regression tree and guidelines about influence of features on the spreading of COVID-19 and mortality due to this infection have been constructed. The paper predicts the number of deaths due to COVID-19 on a 21-day interval using the obtained guidelines on the example of Sweden. Such forecasting was carried out for two potential government action options: with existing precautionary actions and the same precautionary actions, if they had been taken 20 days earlier (following the example of Germany). The RMSE of the mortality forecast does not exceed 4.2, which shows a good prognostic ability of the developed model. At the same time, the simulation based on the strategy of anticipatory introduction of restrictions gives 2-6% lower values of the forecast of the number of new cases. Thus, the results of this study provide an opportunity to assess the impact of decisions about restrictive measures and predict, simulate the consequences of restrictions policy.","Yakovyna, Vitaliy; Shakhovska, Natalya",Math Biosci Eng,,472

OBJECTIVES: The study aimed to evaluate the serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration in patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) as a predictor of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mortality. METHODS: A single-center retrospective observational study was conducted. Forty adult patients (50% men) with confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to the ICU were enrolled. The primary endpoint was mortality at day 60. Serum 25(OH)D concentration was measured on the day of admission to the ICU. We used the Mann-Whitney test, Fisher's exact test, Kaplan-Meier analysis, and receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis to assess serum 25(OH)D concentration as a predictor of COVID-19 mortality. RESULTS: All 40 patients had a low median (IQR) serum 25(OH)D concentration at admission [12 (9-15) ng/mL]. The median (IQR) serum 25(OH)D concentration was greater in survivors [13.3 (10.0-17.1) ng/mL, n = 22] than in nonsurvivors [9.6 (7.9-14.2) ng/mL; n = 18], P = 0.044. The area under the ROC curve was 0.69 (95% CI: 0.52, 0.86; P = 0.044). The 60-d mortality rate of those with serum 25(OH)D concentrations &#8804;9.9 ng/mL (n = 14, 71%) tended to be greater than that of those with concentrations >9.9 ng/mL (n = 26, 31%) (P = 0.065), and they had a 5.6-fold higher risk of death (OR: 5.63; 95% CI: 1.35, 23.45; P = 0.018). CONCLUSIONS: The ICU patients had a low serum 25(OH)D concentration.

This moralization of health-based efforts may generate asymmetries in judgement, whereby harmful by-products of those efforts (i.e., instrumental harm) are perceived as more acceptable than harm resulting from non-C19 efforts, such as prioritizing the economy or non-C19 issues. We tested our predictions in two experimental studies. In Study 1, American participants evaluated the same costs (public shaming, deaths and illnesses, and police abuse of power) as more acceptable when they resulted from efforts to minimize C19's health impacts, than when they resulted from non-health C19 efforts (e.g., prioritizing economic costs) or efforts unrelated to C19 (e.g., reducing traffic deaths). In Study 2, New Zealand participants less favorably evaluated the quality of a research proposal empirically questioning continuing a C19 elimination strategy in NZ than one questioning abandoning an elimination strategy, although both proposals contained the same amount of methodology information. This finding suggests questioning elimination approaches is morally condemned, a similar response to that found when sacred values are questioned. In both studies, condition effects were mediated by lowered moral outrage in response to costs resulting from pursuing health-minded C19 efforts. Follow-up analyses revealed that both heightened personal concern over contracting C19 and liberal ideology were associated with greater asymmetries in human cost evaluation. Altogether, results suggest reducing or eliminating C19 have become moralized, generating asymmetries in evaluations of human suffering.","Graso, Maja; Chen, Fan Xuan; Reynolds, Tania",J Exp Soc Psychol,,472

404625,Comparative Education Review: A 2020 Retrospective,2021,"The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has rapidly impacted all of our lives following its escalation to pandemic status on 11 March 2020. Government guidelines and restrictions implemented to mitigate the risk of COVID-19 community transmission have forced radiation therapy departments to promptly adjust to the significant impact on our ability to deliver best clinical care. The inherent nature of our tri-partied professions relies heavily on multidisciplinary teamwork and patient-clinician interactions. Teamwork and patient interaction are critical to the role of a radiation therapist. The aim of this paper is to describe the experience of the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre's (Peter Mac) radiation therapy services during the preliminary stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in minimising risk to patients, staff and our clinical service. Four critical areas were identified in developing risk mitigation strategies across our service: (a) Workforce planning, (b) Workforce communication, (c) Patient safety and wellbeing, and (d) Staff safety and wellbeing. Each of these initiatives had a focus on continuum of clinical care, whilst minimising risk of cross infection for our radiation therapy workforce and patients alike. Initiatives included, but were not limited to, establishing COVID-Eclipse clinical protocols, remote access to local applications, implementation of Microsoft Teams, personal protective equipment (PPE) guidelines and virtual 'Division of Radiation Oncology' briefing/updates. The COVID-19 pandemic has dictated change in conventional radiation therapy practice. It is hoped that by sharing our experiences, the radiation therapy profession will continue to learn, adapt and navigate this period together, to ensure optimal outcomes for ourselves and our patients.","Anderson, Nigel; Thompson, Kenton; Andrews, Judy; Chesson, Brent; Cray, Alison; Phillips, Damien; Ryan, Michelle; Soteriou, Sally; Trainor, Glenn; Touma, Nilgun",J Med Radiat Sci,,472

Clinical data from 38 COVID-19 patients who were diagnosed, treated and discharged from the Qishan Hospital in Yantai over the period from January to February 2020 were analysed. NLR and procalcitonin (PCT) were determined in the first and fourth weeks after their admission, along with the clinical characteristics and laboratory test results of these patients. Based on results as obtained on the first and fourth weeks after admission, five indices consisting of NLR, white blood cells, neutrophils, lymphocytes (LY) and monocytes (MON) were selected to generate receiver operating characteristic curves, while optimal cutoff values, sensitivities and specificities were obtained according to the Yuden index. Statistically significant differences in neutrophils, LY and the NLR were present in the severe vs. moderate COVID-19 group from the first to the fourth week of their hospitalisation. The cut-off value of NLR for predicting the severity of COVID-19 was 4.425, with a sensitivity of 0.855 and a specificity of 0.979. A statistically significant positive correlation was present between PCT and NLR in the severe group as determined within the first week of admission. NLR can serve as a predictor of COVID-19 disease severity as patients' progress from the first to the fourth week of their hospitalisation. The statistically significant positive correlation between levels of NLR and PCT in severe patients indicated that increases in NLR were accompanied with gradual increases in PCT.","Wang, Kun; Wang, Xin; Du, Jiangdong; Liu, Chunling; Jiang, Yanan; Zhang, Heqiu; Jiang, Haiming; Fu, Qiang",Epidemiol Infect,,472

2020, supplemented by his actions during the COVID 19 crisis in 2020 On the psychoanalytical understanding of the effectiveness of his methods and the susceptibility of voters to destructive populism, she applies Bion's model of containing in conjunction with Herbert Rosenfeld's destructive narcissism and develops the concept of »perverted containing«: in the course of regression to a paranoid-schizoid level, aggressively destructive and omnipotent affects are idealised and the container function of democratic society is increasingly decomposed, distorted and finally twisted

While understanding of the unique needs of COVID-19 survivors is developing, components of the evidence-based Transitional Care Model provide a framework for taking a more immediate, holistic response to caring for these individuals as they moved back into the community. These components include: increasing screening, building trusting relationships, improving patient engagement, promoting collaboration across care teams, undertaking symptom management, increasing family caregiver care/education, coordinating health and social services, and improving care continuity. Evidence generated from rigorous testing of these components reveal the need for federal and state policy solutions to support the following: employment/redeployment of nurses, social workers, and community health workers; training and reimbursement of family caregivers; widespread access to research-based transitional care tools; and coordinated local efforts to address structural barriers to effective transitions. Immediate action on these policy options is necessary to more effectively address the complex issues facing these older adults and their family caregivers who are counting on our care system for essential support.","Naylor, Mary D; Hirschman, Karen B; McCauley, Kathleen",J Aging Soc Policy,,472

All efforts to contain the pathogenesis either using inhibitory drugs or vaccines largelyremained futile due to a lack of better understanding of the genomic feature of this virus. In thepresent study, we compared the 2019-nCoV with other coronaviruses, which indicated that batSARS like coronavirus could be a probable ancestor of the novel coronavirus. The proteinsequence similarity of pangolin-hCoV and bat-hCoV with human coronavirus was higher ascompared to their nucleotide similarity denoting the occurrence of more synonymous mutationsin the genome. Phylogenetic and alignment analysis of 591 novel coronaviruses of differentclades from Group I to Group V revealed several mutations and concomitant amino acidchanges. Detailed investigation on nucleotide substitution unfolded 100 substitutions in thecoding region of which 43 were synonymous and 57 were of non-synonymous type. The nonsynonymous substitutions resulting into 57 amino acid changes were found to be distributed overdifferent hCoV proteins with maximum on spike protein. An important di-amino acid change RGto KR was observed in ORF9 protein. Additionally, several interesting features of the novelcoronavirus genome have been highlighted in respect to various other human infecting viruseswhich may explain extreme pathogenicity, infectivity and simultaneously the reason behindfailure of the antiviral therapies. SUMMARY: This study presents a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV2 isolates to understand discrete mutations that are occurring between patient samples. The analysis unravel various amino acid mutations in the viral proteins which may provide an explanation for varying treatment efficacies of different inhibitory drugs and a future direction towards a combinatorial treatment therapies based on the kind of mutation in the viral genome.","Tiwari, Manish; Mishra, Divya",J Clin Virol,,472

Methods: Data of 21 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and 84 patients with suspected COVID-19 were analyzed by RT-PCR. The epidemiologic and clinical features as well as clinical outcomes were compared between the confirmed and suspected cases. Results: Altogether 105 patients had been enrolled in this study by February 15, 2020 in north Shanghai, including 21 confirmed cases and 84 suspected cases of COVID-19. The incubation period of these confirmed patients with imported COVID-19 was 17.6 days (IQR 5-34 days) and the median time from symptom onset to diagnosis was 145.64 h (IQR 21-441 h). More than 50% of the confirmed patients were older than 51 (range, 51-60) years. Fifty (59.5%) of the 84 probably patients were younger than 40 years, including 27 (32%) patients younger than 30 years. Most confirmed patients were men (61.9%, 13/21), and less than 50% of them had underlying diseases, including diabetes (9.5%, 2/21), hypertension (19%, 4/21), COPD (23.8%, 5/21), and CD (23.8%, 5/21). In addition, 10 (47.6%) of the 21 confirmed patients were ordinary employees, and 12 (57.2%) of them had recently been to Wuhan or had close contacts with people from Wuhan. Of the 84 suspected patients, 28 (33.3%) were retired employees; 69 (82.1%) had recently been to supermarkets and groceries or had a history of traveling abroad or to other cities of China. The common onset symptoms of the patients in both groups were fever and cough. The symptom of Sputum production was more pronounced in probably patients (40.5%, 34/84) than that in confirmed patients (9.5%, 2/21). More than 50% imported patients (53.3%, 56/105) had one and two affected lobes. Twenty-nine (27.6%) of the 105 imported patients had been discharged, no patient had died, and all the other patients are still in hospital. Conclusions: The overall incubation period in this cohort of imported confirmed COVID-19 patients was longer than that in Wuhan, mostly infecting older men. The disease onset of imported COVID-19 infection was occult, and the clinical symptoms were usually mild, mostly presenting as low fever, fatigue, light cough, and mild dyspnea.","Xie, Shuanshuan; Zhang, Guoliang; Yu, Hong; Wang, Jin; Wang, Sheng; Tang, Guangyu; Guo, Changfeng; Li, Jiyu; Wei, Songhua; Wang, Changhui; Qin, Huanlong",Ann.

The aims of this study were to evaluate mental health outcomes among patients with COVID-19 treated in the Fangcang shelter hospitals and analyze potential risk factors associated with these symptoms, including PTSS, symptoms of anxiety, depression, insomnia, and perceived stress. METHOD: This cross-sectional study used an online survey to assess mental health problems of 461 confirmed COVID-19 patients in a Jianghan Fangcang shelter from February 15 to 22, 2020. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to explore potential risk factors. RESULTS: Overall, 25.2%, 50.1%, 54.4%, 10.2%, and 39.7% of all patients reported symptoms of posttraumatic stress, anxiety, depression, insomnia, and perceived stress, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that female sex was associated with all investigated outcomes except insomnia. Patients with lower education level were more likely to endorse anxiety, depression, and higher perceived stress, while patients' family members with other diseases were more likely to endorse severe insomnia. Patients with illness onset to admission less than 7 days were associated with higher perceived stress. DISCUSSION: In this survey study, patients reported high rates of symptoms of posttraumatic stress, anxiety, depression, insomnia, and perceived stress. Combining with the special environment of the shelter hospitals and patient's psychological needs, the health care workers should give more effective interventions to relieve the patients' stress and improve their mental symptoms.","Gu, Yingqi; Zhu, Yi; Xu, Fangzhong; Xi, Juzhe; Xu, Guangxing",Asia Pac Psychiatry,,472

413449,Human Rights Ombudsmen in the Pandemic – Challenges in Protection of Vulnerable Groups,2021,"The economic efficiency of large exhibitions or forums directly depends on the management of logistics flows. The efficiency of event logistics depends on various factors, some of which can be controlled, while other force majeure factors are not influenced by humans. Major convention and exhibition events include a variety of communications, including business deals, speaker speeches, informal conversations, numerous negotiations, etc. If the impact of force majeure cannot be foreseen and controlled, then the organizers are obliged to calculate the impact of all controlled logistics processes of the event. This article highlights two major areas of logistics exhibition and convention events. Detailed classification of logistics processes is presented by example of the St. Petersburg International Cultural Forum. The main objective of this article is to highlight the key aspects of real practical tasks of management of exhibition events. The paper formulates specific solutions to a variety of logistics challenges that are important for the successful organization of a congress and exhibition event. The research methodology includes a theoretical description of the logistics flows of many areas in the management and organization of a specific exhibition event. In the current COVID-19 pandemic new global challenges related to the rules for the movement of people in premises, exhibitions, forums require an accurate description of the processes of movement of flows of people, including speakers, service staff and guests. An extended overview of the logistics flows of the Forum presented in this article provides an understanding of the logistics processes of conventions and exhibitions. Examples of successful practical solutions can be useful in future challenges of organizing exhibition and convention events that directly affect the socio-economic status of the host territory. © 2020 ACM.","Ulyanov, A.; Genadieva, E.; Draganov, M.","2020 International Scientific Conference on Digital Transformation on Manufacturing, Infrastructure and Service, DTMIS 2020",,472

414744,Procrastination predicts online self-regulated learning and online learning ineffectiveness during the coronavirus lockdown,2021,"BACKGROUND: On March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak a pandemic. During this period, surgical activity and admission to the Emergency Department (ED) decreased globally. The aim of this article is to understand how the admission of a patient to the ED for vascular surgery changed in our center in Portugal and if this situation prevented urgent surgical procedures. METHODS: Through a retrospective study, we compared the volume of patients admitted to the ED during the emergency state (ES) in Portugal with the same period in 2019. In addition, we analyzed the urgent surgical activity during the ES and in the correspondent period of the previous 10 years, regarding limb acute ischemia, acute aortic pathology, and vascular trauma. Two groups of patients were formed-patients operated during the ES and during the non-ES, for control. Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS® Statistics, version 25. RESULTS: In the ES, 115 patients were observed at the ED and 179 in the 2019 corresponding period. During the ES, patients significantly recurred less to the ED directly from home (P < 0.001) and were less referred to the ED by primary care doctors (P < 0.001). Patients observed at the ED were significantly more urgent-required urgent surgery or were admitted to the department-than those in 2019 (40% vs. 24%). However, there were no differences when only considering urgent surgery (14% in ES vs. 10% in 2019). In the ES, 38% of patients observed at the ED were discharged with no follow-up related to vascular surgery against 60% in 2019, although this difference was not significant. Compared with the preceding 10 years, there are not significant differences in the number of patients who underwent urgent surgery in both ES and non-ES periods. In patients with acute limb ischemia, we did not find an increase in the time between onset of symptoms and ED admission, during the ES. CONCLUSIONS: Fewer patients were admitted at the ED during the ES, and those admitted were significantly more urgent. We did not find a decrease in the number of urgent surgeries when compared with the preceding 10 years. Therefore, we cannot assume that coronavirus pandemic precluded urgent surgical procedures.","Correia, Mafalda; Constâncio, Vânia; Silva, Joana Cruz; Lima, Pedro; Moreira, Mário; Antunes, Luís F; Fonseca, Manuel",Ann Vasc Surg,,472

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed data from 489,769 adults enrolled in the UK Biobank-a population-based cohort study. The exposures of interest are BMI categories and central obesity (e.g., larger waist circumference). Using genome-wide genotyping data, we also computed polygenic risk scores (PRSs) that represent an individual's overall genetic risk for each obesity trait. The outcome was severe COVID-19, defined by hospitalization for laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. RESULTS: Of 489,769 individuals, 33% were normal weight (BMI, 18.5-24.9â¯kg/m2), 43% overweight (25.0-29.9â¯kg/m2), and 24% obese (&#8805;30.0â¯kg/m2). The UK Biobank identified 641 patients with severe COVID-19. Compared to adults with normal weight, those with a higher BMI had a dose-response increases in the risk of severe COVID-19, with the following adjusted ORs: for 25.0-29.9â¯kg/m2, 1.40 (95%CI 1.14-1.73; Pâ¯=â¯0.002); for 30.0-34.9â¯kg/m2, 1.73 (95%CI 1.36-2.20; Pâ¯<â¯0.001); for 35.0-39.9â¯kg/m2, 2.82 (95%CI 2.08-3.83; Pâ¯<â¯0.001); and for &#8805;40.0â¯kg/m2, 3.30 (95%CI 2.17-5.03; Pâ¯<â¯0.001). Likewise, central obesity was associated with significantly higher risk of severe COVID-19 (Pâ¯<â¯0.001). Furthermore, larger PRS for BMI was associated with higher risk of outcome (adjusted OR per BMI PRS Z-score 1.14, 95%CI 1.05-1.24; Pâ¯=â¯0.004). CONCLUSIONS: In this large population-based cohort, individuals with more-severe obesity, central obesity, or genetic predisposition for obesity are at higher risk of developing severe-COVID-19.","Zhu, Zhaozhong; Hasegawa, Kohei; Ma, Baoshan; Fujiogi, Michimasa; Camargo, Carlos A; Liang, Liming",Metabolism,,472

Inequalities in the region lead to barriers regarding the best use of diagnostic tests during the pandemic. There is a need for a simplified guideline, considering the region's health resources' low availability, international guidelines, medical literature, and local expertise. METHODS: Nine experts from Latin American countries developed a simplified algorithm for COVID-19 diagnosis, using a modified Delphi method. Twenty-four questions related to diagnostic settings were proposed, followed by discussion of the literature and experts' experience. RESULTS: The algorithm considers three timeframes (&#8804;7 days, 8-13 days, and &#8805; 14 days) and discusses diagnostic options for each one. SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR is the test of choice from day 1 to day 14 after symptom onset or close contact, although antigen testing may be used in particular situations, from days 5 to 7. Antibody assays may be used for confirmation, mainly after day 14. If the clinical suspicion is very high, but other tests are negative, these assays may be used as an adjunct to decision-making from day 8 to day 13. CONCLUSION: The proposed algorithm aims to support COVID-19 diagnosis decision-making in Latin America.","Fay, Fabian F; Alvarez-Moreno, Carlos Arturo; Bonvehi, Pablo E; Espinoza, Carolina Cucho; Hidalgo, Marco Luis Herrera; Marcano-Lozada, Marcel; Perez, Carlos M; Pulchinelli, Alvaro; Sáenz-Flor, Klever Vinicio; Condino-Neto, Antonio",Int. j. infect. dis,,472

Nowadays it has been proven that a deficiency of certain micronutrients in the diet can disrupt chemical, structural and regulatory processes in the organism, which negatively affects, first of all, the state of immune system. Zinc is one of the most significant essential trace elements affecting immunological resistance. The aim of the study was to substantiate the need of including zinc-containing products and diet supplements in the diet of the population during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on the basis of the study of pathogenetic mechanisms of various disorders of the immunological status under zinc deficit. Material and methods. This review analyzes the data from scientific electronic libraries CyberLeninka, eLIBRARY.RU, the Google Scholar databases and bibliographic medical databases MEDLINE and PubMed-NCBI. Results and discussion. During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, adequate zinc supply is especially important, due to its antiviral, immunomodulatory and antiapoptotic effects. This element also regulates the severity of the cytokine response, exhibits antibacterial properties and helps to compensate for chronic comorbid diseases, which plays a particularly significant role in preventing severe SARS-CoV-2 and recurrent respiratory diseases. Prevention and correction of zinc deficiency is considered as one of the important measures during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, aimed at increasing antiviral and general immunity, reducing the systemic inflammatory response and correcting hormonal and metabolic status. Conclusion. The pathogenetically substantiated inclusion of zinc-containing foods and supplements in the diet will enhance the immunity of the population during the SARSCoV- 2 pandemic.","Sankova, M V; Kytko, O V; Dydykina, I S; Chilikov, V V; Laptina, V I; Markina, A D",Vopr Pitan,,472

425120,Interpretation of the Protocol for Prevention and Control of COVID-19 in China (Edition 7),2020,"BACKGROUND: Clinical data on patients admitted to hospital with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) provide clinicians and public health officials with information to guide practice and policy. The aims of this study were to describe patients with COVID-19 admitted to hospital and intensive care, and to investigate predictors of outcome to characterize severe acute respiratory infection. METHODS: This observational cohort study used Canadian data from 32 selected hospitals included in a global multisite cohort between Jan. 24 and July 7, 2020. Adult and pediatric patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 who received care in an intensive care unit (ICU) and a sampling of up to the first 60 patients receiving care on hospital wards were included. We performed descriptive analyses of characteristics, interventions and outcomes. The primary analyses examined in-hospital mortality, with secondary analyses of the length of hospital and ICU stay. RESULTS: Between January and July 2020, among 811 patients admitted to hospital with a diagnosis of COVID-19, the median age was 64 (interquartile range [IQR] 53-75) years, 495 (61.0%) were men, 46 (5.7%) were health care workers, 9 (1.1%) were pregnant, 26 (3.2%) were younger than 18 years and 9 (1.1%) were younger than 5 years. The median time from symptom onset to hospital admission was 7 (IQR 3-10) days. The most common symptoms on admission were fever, shortness of breath, cough and malaise. Diabetes, hypertension and cardiac, kidney and respiratory disease were the most common comorbidities. Among all patients, 328 received care in an ICU, admitted a median of 0 (IQR 0-1) days after hospital admission. Critically ill patients received treatment with invasive mechanical ventilation (88.8%), renal replacement therapy (14.9%) and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (4.0%); 26.2% died. Among those receiving mechanical ventilation, 31.2% died. Age was an influential predictor of mortality (odds ratio per additional year of life 1.06, 95% confidence interval 1.03-1.09). INTERPRETATION: Patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 commonly had fever, respiratory symptoms and comorbid conditions. Increasing age was associated with the development of critical illness and death; however, most critically ill patients in Canada, including those requiring mechanical ventilation, survived and were discharged from hospital.","Murthy, Srinivas; Archambault, Patrick M; Atique, Anika; Carrier, François Martin; Cheng, Matthew P; Codan, Cassidy; Daneman, Nick; Dechert, William; Douglas, Sarah; Fiest, Kirsten M; Fowler, Robert; Goco, Geraldine; Gu, Yusing; Guerguerian, Anne-Marie; Hall, Richard; Hsu, Jimmy M; Joffe, Ari; Jouvet, Philippe; Kelly, Laurel; Kho, Michelle E; Kruisselbrink, Rebecca J; Kumar, Deepali; Kutsogiannis, Demetrios James; Lamontagne, François; Lee, Todd C; Menon, Kusum; O039,; Grady, Heather; Hearn, Katie; Ovakim, Daniel H; Pharand, Scott G; Pitre, Tyler; Reel, Riley; Reeve, Brenda; Rewa, Oleksa; Richardson, David; Rishu, Asgar; Sandhu, Gyan; Sarfo-Mensah, Shirley; Shadowitz, Ellen; Sligl, Wendy; Solomon, Joshua; Stelfox, Henry T; Swanson, Ashleigh; Tessier-Grenier, Hubert; Tsang, Jennifer L Y; Wood, Gordon",CMAJ Open,,472
425704,Contingent reflections on coronavirus and priorities for educational planning and development,2020,"We aimed to examine the circulating microRNA (miRNA) profile of hospitalized COVID-19 patients and evaluate its potential as a source of biomarkers for the management of the disease. This was an observational and multicenter study that included 84 patients with a positive nasopharyngeal swab Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for SARS-CoV-2 recruited during the first pandemic wave in Spain (March-June 2020). Patients were stratified according to disease severity: hospitalized patients admitted to the clinical wards without requiring critical care and patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). An additional study was completed including ICU nonsurvivors and survivors. Plasma miRNA profiling was performed using reverse transcription polymerase quantitative chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Predictive models were constructed using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression. Ten circulating miRNAs were dysregulated in ICU patients compared to ward patients. LASSO analysis identified a signature of three miRNAs (miR-148a-3p, miR-451a and miR-486-5p) that distinguishes between ICU and ward patients [AUC (95% CI) = 0.89 (0.81-0.97)]. Among critically ill patients, six miRNAs were downregulated between nonsurvivors and survivors. A signature based on two miRNAs (miR-192-5p and miR-323a-3p) differentiated ICU nonsurvivors from survivors [AUC (95% CI) = 0.80 (0.64-0.96)]. The discriminatory potential of the signature was higher than that observed for laboratory parameters such as leukocyte counts, C-reactive protein (CRP) or D-dimer [maximum AUC (95% CI) for these variables = 0.73 (0.55-0.92)]. miRNA levels were correlated with the duration of ICU stay. Specific circulating miRNA profiles are associated with the severity of COVID-19. Plasma miRNA signatures emerge as a novel tool to assist in the early prediction of vital status deterioration among ICU patients.","de Gonzalo-Calvo, David; Benítez, Iván D; Pinilla, Lucía; Carratalá, Amara; Moncusí-Moix, Anna; Gort-Paniello, Clara; Molinero, Marta; González, Jessica; Torres, Gerard; Bernal, María; Pico, Silvia; Almansa, Raquel; Jorge, Noelia; Ortega, Alicia; Bustamante-Munguira, Elena; Gómez, José Manuel; González-Rivera, Milagros; Micheloud, Dariela; Ryan, Pablo; Martinez, Amalia; Tamayo, Luis; Aldecoa, César; Ferrer, Ricard; Ceccato, Adrián; Fernández-Barat, Laia; Motos, Ana; Riera, Jordi; Menéndez, Rosario; Garcia-Gasulla, Dario; Peñuelas, Oscar; Torres, Antoni; Bermejo-Martin, Jesús F; Barbé, Ferran",Transl. res,,472
425722,Sustainability of supply chains in the wake of the coronavirus (COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2) pandemic: lessons and trends,2020,"Since the outbreak in Wuhan City, China, in late December 2019, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread to nearly the whole world, so that it was declared a pandemic by the Word Health Organization. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative organism of COVID-19, is extremely infectious and can adhere to droplet nuclei of &lt; 5 mu m diameter and become airborne (aerosol). Since COVID-19 was declared a pandemic, there has been controversy on the use of cloth masks by the public, because of the still inconclusive evidence of the efficacy of cloth masks in protecting against COVID-19 transmission. Universal masking as a healthcare intervention in the community is currently made mandatory by local governments of most countries, since they follow the recent recommendation by the World Health Organization. The issuing of the WHO recommendation on the public use of masks was based on a study demonstrating that COVID-19 transmission does not occur only through droplets but also through aerosols. In addition, there was a study showing that COVID-19 transmission does not only occur from patients with clinical symptoms but also through asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic subjects, so that universal masking is of benefit in providing protection when used by healthy people and as source control to prevent cross-transmission to other people. This review article aims to discuss the mechanism of COVID-19 transmission, the evidence related to the efficacy of cloth masks, and the guidelines related to the selection and use of masks by the general population.","Yenny, Y.; Herwana, E.; Wratsangka, R.",Universa Medicina,,472

427357,Prospects for Expansion of the Insurance Market through the Prisence of Financial Activation of Sustainable Development in the Region,2021,"Considering the prevailing scenario of COVID‐19 pandemic, early detection of the disease is an important and crucial step in disease management. Early detection and correct treatment may limit disease progression to severe levels and prevent deaths. In addition, early isolation of infected patients will lead to control transmission rate and will possibly reduce the stress on the present healthcare system. Currently, the most common and reliable testing method available for COVID‐19 diagnosis is real‐time reverse transcription‐polymerase chain reaction (rRT‐PCR) test. However, the chest radiological (X‐ray) imaging can be used as an alternate method to rRT‐PCR test, and early COVID‐19 symptoms can be investigated by critical examination of patient's chest scans. In the present work, a novel machine learning (ML)‐based analytical framework is developed for automatic detection of COVID‐19 using chest X‐ray (CXR) images of plausible patients. The framework is designed, trained, and validated to identify four classes of CXR images namely, healthy, bacterial pneumonia, viral pneumonia, and COVID‐19. The experimental results pose the proposed framework as a potential candidate for COVID‐19 disease diagnosis using CXR images, with training, validation, and testing accuracy of 92.4%, 88.24%, and 87.13%, respectively, in four‐class classification. The comparative analysis demonstrates the better capabilities of the proposed framework COVID‐19 detection along with other types of pneumonia.

This study explored the international literature on physical activity, sedentary behavior and well-being in adults with physical disabilities and/or chronic diseases during the first wave of the pandemic. Method: In a rapid review, we included studies reporting on physical activity, sedentary behavior and/or well-being in adults with physical disabilities and/or chronic diseases. Four databases (Pubmed, CINAHL, PsycInfo, Embase) were searched for studies published until 30 September 2020. Results: We included twenty-nine studies involving eleven different types of disabilities or health conditions from twenty-one different countries. Twenty-six studies reported on physical activity, of which one reported an increase during the COVID-19 pandemic, four studies reported no difference, and twenty-one studies reported a decrease. Thirteen studies reported a decline in well-being. Only one study measured sedentary behavior, reporting an increase. Conclusion: Despite the variety in methods used, almost all studies reported negative impacts on physical activity and well-being in people with physical disabilities and/or chronic disease during the first wave of the pandemic. These findings highlight the importance of supporting this population, especially in times of crisis.","de Boer, Diederik R; Hoekstra, Femke; Huetink, Kimberley I M; Hoekstra, Trynke; Krops, Leonie A; Hettinga, Florentina J",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,472

427771,Impact of meteorological condition changes on air quality and particulate chemical composition during the COVID-19 lockdown,2021,"In the unique context of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, researchers and clinicians alike drew attention to the risks involved by physical and social isolation for mental health. Factors like resilience, gender, urban/rural environment, or preexisting anxiety can impact anxious states produced by home forced isolation. Based on these, we assumed that: i) there are significant differences in the level of anxiety (state) during the pandemic, depending on the living area of the subjects;ii) gender plays a moderating role in the relationship between resilience and anxiety;and iii) anxiety (trait), experiential avoidance, resilience, and family connectedness, determine the level of anxiety (state). The MemoryLab team conducted the present study on 495 subjects (n=411 women, age between 18 and 65). Of these, 350 live in large and medium urban areas, 63 in small urban areas, and 82 in rural areas. As instruments, we used The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI 2.0), The Acceptance and Action Questionnaire 2 (AAQ-2), The Aggression Questionnaire (AQ), The Family Connectedness Questionnaire, and Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale 10 (CD-RISC-10), as well as the standard division of living areas according to community size. Data collection took place online during the spring peak of the pandemic. According to ANOVA analysis, people living in small urban areas have a higher level of anxiety. The difference is significant compared to those living in large and medium cities and villages. Gender has no moderating role in the relationship between resilience and the anxiety state. Also, experiential avoidance, anxiety (trait), and resilience play a significant role on the level of anxiety (state), measured during social isolation. The results could be an important indicator for understanding psychological mechanisms guiding interventions to support the communities effectively.

427822,All STEM-ed up: Gaps and silences around ecological education in Australia,2021,"BACKGROUND: Belonging to certain ethnic groups, socioeconomic status and cramped living conditions are assumed to affect the risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2. We wanted to examine correlations between a selection of sociodemographic variables and infection rates in Oslo's districts. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Aggregated data on districts obtained from Oslo City Government's statistics database were collated with cumulative figures for PCR-confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 as of 3 December 2020. We selected some variables from the living conditions indicators that showed a strong correlation with infection rates. The composite variable 'socioeconomic status' included income, education and labour market attachment. 'Household density' included the proportion of people in cramped living conditions and multi-family households. We performed an unadjusted and adjusted standard multiple linear regression analysis of the impact of immigrant ratio, socioeconomic status and household density on infection rates. RESULTS: Immigrant ratio, socioeconomic status and household density were all associated with infection rates in the districts. Pearson's correlation coefficients (95 % CI) were 0.97 (0.93 to 0.99), -0.93 (-0.97 to -0.86) and 0.88 (0.77 to 0.98) respectively, all with p <0.001. In the adjusted model, immigrant ratio was still associated with the infection rate, B = 3.95 (2.16 to 5.73), p <0.001, however there was no longer a statistically significant association between socioeconomic status or household density and infection rates. INTERPRETATION: Immigrant ratio seems to be an important risk factor for infection in Oslo. Our analysis suggests that the correlation may be due to factors other than low socioeconomic status and high household density.","Søegaard, Erik Ganesh Iyer; Kan, Zhanna",Tidsskr. nor. laegeforen,,472

In 'normal' times, these are risks covered by social welfare states via social insurance and protection policies. My research question is what role the welfare state plays in a global emergency - here the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic. I test for an impact of the welfare state on risk perceptions using COVIDiSTRESS data comparing 70 countries in April, 2020. Adjusting for local timing and severity of outbreak, I demonstrate that strength of the welfare state predicts lower risk perceptions. However, this depends on the speed of government intervention: rapid intervention removes the effect of the welfare state. Therefore, I conclude from this study that when governments fail to take swift measures, the welfare state plays a major role in alleviating risk perceptions.","Breznau, Nate",Eur. Soc.,,472

METHODS: This retrospective review included 499 patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia between February 11 and March 8, 2020. Subgroups sharing the CT features were identified using LCA. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were utilized to analyze the association between clinical types and the LCA-derived subgroups. RESULTS: Two radiological subgroups were identified using LCA. There were 228 subjects (45.69%) in class 1 and 271 subjects (54.31%) in class 2. The CT findings of class 1 were smaller pulmonary infection volume, more peripheral distribution, more GGO, more maximum lesion range &#8804; 5 cm, a smaller number of lesions, less involvement of lobes, less air bronchogram, less dilatation of vessels, less hilar and mediastinal lymph node enlargement, and less pleural effusion than the CT findings of class 2. Univariate analysis demonstrated that older age, therapy, presence of fever, presence of hypertension, decreased lymphocyte count, and increased CRP levels were significant parameters associated with an increased risk for class 2. Multivariate analyses revealed that the patients with clinically severe type disease had a 1.97-fold risk of class 2 than the patients with clinically moderate-type disease. CONCLUSIONS: The demographic and clinical differences between the two radiological subgroups based on the LCA were significantly different. Two radiological subgroups were significantly associated with clinical moderate and severe types. KEY POINTS: â¢ Two radiological subgroups were identified using LCA. â¢ Older age, therapy, presence of fever, presence of hypertension, decreased lymphocyte count, and increased CRP levels were significant parameters with an increased risk for class 2 defined by LCA. â¢ Patients with clinically severe type had a 1.97-fold higher risk of class 2 defined by LCA in comparison with patients showing clinically moderate-type disease.","Fang, Xu; Li, Xiao; Bian, Yun; Ji, Xiang; Lu, Jianping",Eur Radiol,,472

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A non-validated, structured, self-administered, electronic survey with 35 closed multiple choice questions was conducted in Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, and English and Deutsch versions from April 1st to April 30th, 2020. The survey was distributed through social networks and the official American Confederation of Urology (CAU) website. It was anonymous, mainly addressed to Latin American urologists and urology residents. It included 35 questions exploring different aspects: 1) Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and internal management protocols for healthcare providers; 2) Priority surgeries and urological urgencies and 3) Inpatient and outpatient care. RESULTS: Of 864 surveys received, 846 had at least 70% valid responses and were included in the statistical analyses. Surveys corresponded to South America in 62% of the cases, Central America and North America in 29.7%. 12.7% were residents. Regarding to PPE and internal management protocols, 88% confirmed the implementation of specific protocols and 45.4% have not received training to perform a safe clinical practice; only 2.3% reported being infected with COVID-19. 60.9% attended urgent surgeries. The following major uro-oncologic surgeries were reported as high priority: Radical Nephrectomy (RN) 58.4%, and Radical Cystectomy (RC) 57.3%. When we associate the capacity of hospitalization (urologic beds available) and percentage of high-priority surgery performed, we observed that centers with fewer urological beds (10-20) compared to centers with more urological beds (31-40) performed more frequently major urologic cancer surgeries: RN 54.5% vs 60.8% (p=0.0003), RC 53.1% vs 64.9% (p=0.005) respectively. CONCLUSIONS: At the time of writing (May 13th 2020) our data represents a snapshot of COVID-19 outbreak in Latin American urological practices. Our findings have practical implications and should be contextualized considering many factors related to patients and urological care: The variability of health care scenarios, institutional capacity, heterogeneity and burden of urologic disease, impact of surgical indications and decision making when prioritizing and scheduling surgeries in times of COVID-19 pandemic.","Autrán-Gómez, Ana María; Tobia, Ignacio; Molina, Ricardo Castillejos; Covarrubias, Francisco Rodríguez; Benzing, Frank; Maruccia, Serena; Reis, Leonardo de O; Lay, Ramón Rodríguez; De la Reza, Marcelo Torrico; Torres, Felix Santaella; Porras, Andrés Hernández; Rodríguez, Alejandro",Int Braz J Urol,,472

The PubMed, Google Scholar, Embase, Scopus, Clinicaltrials.gov, and International Clinical Trials Registry Platform databases were systematically searched for the following keywords: respiratory tract infection, probiotics, viral infection, COVID-19, and clinical trial. A total of 27 clinical trials conducted on 9433 patients with RTI plus 10 ongoing clinical studies of probiotics intervention in Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were reviewed. The review looked at the potency of probiotics for the hindrance and/or treatment of RTI diseases, this may also apply to COVID-19. The review found that probiotics could significantly increase the plasma levels of cytokines, the effect of influenza vaccine and quality of life, as well as reducing the titer of viruses and the incidence and duration of respiratory infections. These antiviral and immune-modulating activities and their ability to stimulate interferon production recommend the use of probiotics as an adjunctive therapy to prevent COVID-19. Based on this extensive review of RCTs we suggest that probiotics are a rational complementary treatment for RTI diseases and a viable option to support faster recovery.","Darbandi, Atieh; Asadi, Arezoo; Ghanavati, Roya; Afifirad, Roghayeh; Darb Emamie, Amir; Kakanj, Maryam; Talebi, Malihe",Int J Infect Dis,,472

We utilized the Norwegian Institute of Public Health's Live map of covid-19 evidence on 11 May and included 59 studies. Six reported on implementing interventions, but none reported on effects of the interventions. HCWs reported low interest in professional help, and greater reliance on social support and contact. Exposure to covid-19 was the most commonly reported correlate of mental health problems, followed by female gender, and worry about infection or about infecting others. Social support correlated with less mental health problems. HCWs reported anxiety, depression, sleep problems, and distress during the covid-19 pandemic. We assessed the certainty of the estimates of prevalence of these symptoms as very low using GRADE.

Herd immunity offers indirect protection to susceptible members of the population. If the acquired immunity of a community rises above 67%, then a gradual decline in the number of incident cases is recorded. How many deaths would have occurred in the West African countries by the time at least 67% of our people are infected with the present case fatality rate (CFR)? The objective of this study was to develop a forecast of the number of COVID-19 deaths that would be recorded to attain herd immunity for each country in West-Africa. We predicted the numbers of deaths using publicly available demographic and COVID-19 data. To attain herd immunity in West Africa 5.2 million COVID-19 deaths would have occurred assuming the CFR is maintained at the current rates in the region. Attention should be focused on strategies that would limit the spread of infection and protect the most vulnerable population groups while the race to develop an effective vaccine should be hastened.","Ilesanmi, Olayinka Stephen; Akande, Abayomi; Afolabi, Aanuoluwapo Adeyimika",Pan Afr Med J,,472

Using a very detailed dataset at the weekly and municipality level on the sales of a supermarket chain, we are able to separately identify the effects on sales for 12 different food products and for three population age groups. Furthermore, we distinguish between the impact of the lockdown, which affected the entire territory by mid-March, from the effect of the number of new confirmed positive COVID-19 cases at the municipal level. Our results show strong stockpiling effects for most of the products in the first week of adoption of the lockdown measures. On the other hand, the number of new cases at the municipal level is associated with reductions in sales, pointing towards increased fears of being infected as the main driver of the slowdown in sales. Finally, when we do a separate analysis for different age groups, we find no effects for individuals aged 66 and over.","Vall Castelló, Judit; Lopez Casasnovas, Guillem",Econ Hum Biol,,472

The following 100 days saw anthropogenic movements quickly halt, before slowly easing back to a ""new"" normality. In this short communication, we use data from official UK air-quality sensors (DEFRA AURN) and the UK Met Office stations to show how lockdown measures affected air quality in the UK. We compare the 100 days post-lockdown (23 March to 30 June 2020) with the same period from the previous 7 years. We find, as shown in numerous studies of other countries, the nitrogen oxides levels across the country dropped substantially (â¼ 50%). However, we also find the ozone levels increased (â¼ 10%), and the levels of sulphur dioxide more than doubled across the country. These changes, driven by a complex balance in the air chemistry near the surface, may reflect the influence of low humidity as suggested by Met Office data, and potentially, the reduction of nitrogen oxides and their interactions with multiple pollutants.","Higham, J E; Ramírez, C Acosta; Green, M A; Morse, A P",Air Qual Atmos Health,,472

A subset of integrins that recognize the arginyl-glycyl-aspartic acid (RGD) sequence in the cognate ligands has been predicted in silico to bind the spike glycoprotein and, thereby, to be exploited for viral infection. Here, we show experimental evidence that the beta1 integrins predominantly expressed on human pulmonary epithelial cell lines and primary mouse alveolar epithelial cells bind to this spike protein. The cellular beta1 integrins support adhesive interactions with the spike protein independently of ACE2, suggesting the possibility that the beta1 integrins may function as an alternative receptor for SARS-CoV-2, which could be targeted for the prevention of viral infections.","Park, E.

Crisis resource management (CRM) provides a framework to tackle these challenges and is well established in other resuscitative disciplines. The current Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has exposed a potential quality gap in emergency preparedness and the ability to adapt to emergency scenarios in real time. METHODS: Available resources in the literature in other disciplines and expert consensus were used to identify key elements of CRM as they apply to acute stroke management. RESULTS: We outline essential ingredients of CRM as a means to mitigate nontechnical challenges providers face during acute stroke care. These strategies include situational awareness, triage and prioritization, mitigation of cognitive load, team member role clarity, communication, and debriefing. Incorporation of CRM along with simulation is an established tool in other resuscitative disciplines and can be incorporated into acute stroke care. CONCLUSIONS: As stroke care processes evolve during these trying times, the importance of consistent, safe, and efficacious care facilitated by CRM principles offers a unique avenue to alleviate human factors and support high-performing teams.","Rajendram, Phavalan; Notario, Lowyl; Reid, Cliff; Wira, Charles R; Suarez, Jose I; Weingart, Scott D; Khosravani, Houman",,,472

It will cause a large number of false-positive and false-negative tests if currently used diagnostic reagents are undermined. Based on genotyping of 31,421 SARS-CoV-2 genome samples collected up to July 23, 2020, we reveal that essentially all of the current COVID-19 diagnostic targets have undergone mutations. We further show that SARS-CoV-2 has the most mutations on the targets of various nucleocapsid (N) gene primers and probes, which have been widely used around the world to diagnose COVID-19. To understand whether SARS-CoV-2 genes have mutated unevenly, we have computed the mutation rate and mutation h-index of all SARS-CoV-2 genes, indicating that the N gene is one of the most non-conservative genes in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. We show that due to human immune response induced APOBEC mRNA (Câ¯>â¯T) editing, diagnostic targets should also be selected to avoid cytidines. Our findings might enable optimally selecting the conservative SARS-CoV-2 genes and proteins for the design and development of COVID-19 diagnostic reagents, prophylactic vaccines, and therapeutic medicines.

Therefore, we conducted a population-based study of 2.6 million Danish citizens investigating the occurrence and impact of COVID-19 in patients with liver cirrhosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective population-based cohort study was conducted in the Capital Region of Denmark and Region Zealand in the study period between 1 March 2020 up until 31 May 2020, with the only eligibility criteria being a reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for presence of viral genomic material confirming COVID-19. The patients were subsequently stratified according to presence of pre-existing liver cirrhosis. RESULTS: Among 575,935 individuals tested, 1713 patients had a diagnosis of cirrhosis. COVID-19 occurredsignificantly lessamongpatients with cirrhosis (n = 15; 0.9%, p < .01) compared with the population without cirrhosis (n = 10,593; 1.8%). However, a large proportion (n = 6;40.0%) required a COVID-19 related hospitalization which was correlated with higher values of alanine aminotransferase (p < .01) and lactate dehydrogenase (p = .04). In addition, one-in-three (n = 2; 13.3%) required intensive therapy. Four patients died (26.7%) and mortality was associated with higher MELD scores, co-existing type 2 diabetes, and bacterial superinfections.

In this study, we summarized the findings of LUS and explore the value of semiquantitative LUS scores in evaluation and follow-up of COVID-19 pneumonia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospectively studied the LUS and chest CT imaging of 128 critically ill patients with COVID-19. The imaging data were reviewed to acquire the LUS and CT scores. The correlation between LUS scores and CT scores were made to evaluate the accuracy of LUS. A cut-off point of LUS score was calculated to distinguish critical-type patients from severe-type patients. LUS follow-up of 72 patients were compared with the gold standard chest CT. RESULTS: The most common LUS features of COVID-19 pneumonia were crowded or coalescent B-lines with multifocal small consolidations in multi-zone. The mean LUS score was 8.1 points in severe-type patients and 15.7 points in critical-type patients (P<0.05). The correlation between LUS scores and CT scores was high (r=0.891, p<0.01) and it was higher in critical-type patients than that in severe-type patients. The LUS score higher than 10.5 points had a 97.4% sensitivity and 75.0% specificity to distinguish critical-type patients. The consistency of LUS and chest CT in follow-up was 0.596, with higher consistency in diagnosis of lesion progression (Kappa values was 0.774).

Examination of Student Attitudes,2021,"While elderly patients are at high risk of fatality, research concerning COVID-19 has largely been done on clarifying the clinical features. As such, the present work aims to identify risk factors for mortality in elderly patients with COVID-19. Given that single-centre studies are less likely informative as elderly remains a minority in the total Chinese population, the present study reviewed the clinical data of geriatric COVID-19 patients gathered from different sources in the public domain. Based on the data of 154 individuals from 26 provinces, age remained a key mortality risk factor among geriatric patients of different ages. While dyspnoea and chest pain/discomfort were more commonly seen in deceased patients as they represented severe pneumonia, fever was more prominent in surviving patients. This was likely due to the lower baseline body temperature observed in elderly which translated to a lower maximum temperature of fever. However, lowering the threshold temperature for fever is not recommended in surveillance. Instead, baseline body temperature measured on a regular basis should be used to define the threshold temperature for fever. Against mixed results, more research should be done on identifying comorbidities associated with mortality in geriatric patients.","Leung, Char",Mech Ageing Dev,,472

Besides yield, the effects of heat stress on fruit quality traits remain poorly characterised. In tomato, insights into how fruits regulate cellular metabolism in response to heat stress could contribute to the development of heat-tolerant varieties, without detrimental effects on quality. In the present study, the changes occurring in wild type tomato fruits after exposure to transient heat stress have been elucidated at the transcriptome, cellular and metabolite level. An impact on fruit quality was evident as nutritional attributes changed in response to heat stress. Fruit carotenogenesis was affected, predominantly at the stage of phytoene formation, although altered desaturation/isomerisation arose during the transient exposure to high temperatures. Plastidial isoprenoid compounds showed subtle alterations in their distribution within chromoplast sub-compartments. Metabolite profiling suggests limited effects on primary/intermediary metabolism but lipid remodelling was evident. The heat-induced molecular signatures included the accumulation of sucrose and triacylglycerols, and a decrease in the degree of membrane lipid unsaturation, which influenced the volatile profile. Collectively, these data provide valuable insights into the underlying biochemical and molecular adaptation of fruit to heat stress and will impact on our ability to develop future climate resilient tomato varieties.

434602,VR platform enabling crowdsourcing of embodied HRI experiments – case study of online robot competition,2021,"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted mental health. Up to a quarter of the population has reported mental health disorders. This has been studied mainly from a nosological perspective, according to diagnostic criteria. Nevertheless, we did not find studies that have explored the daily expressions of the population. Our objective was to evaluate the perceptions of the COVID-19 pandemic and its repercussions on the emotional well-being of the Colombian population. METHODS: We performed a Twitter metrics and trend analysis. Initially, in the trend analysis, we calculated the average duration in hours of the 20 most popular trending topics of the day in Colombia and we grouped them into trends related to COVID-19 and unrelated trends. Subsequently, we identified dates of events associated with the pandemic relevant to the country, and they were related to the behaviour of the trends studied. Additionally, we did an exploratory analysis of these, selected the tweets with the greatest reach and categorised them in an inductive way to analyse them qualitatively. RESULTS: Issues not related to COVID-19 were more far-reaching than those related to coronavirus. However, a rise in these issues was seen on some dates consistent with important events in Colombia. We found expressions of approval and disapproval, solidarity and accusation. Inductively, we identified categories of informative tweets, humour, fear, stigma and discrimination, politics and entities, citizen complaints, and self-care and optimism. CONCLUSIONS: The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic generates different reactions in the population, which increasingly have more tools to express themselves and know the opinions of others. Social networks play a fundamental role in the communication of the population, so this content could serve as a public health surveillance tool and a useful and accessible means of communication in the management of health crises.","Botero-Rodríguez, Felipe; Mosquera-Quiñónez, Melizza; Martínez Torres, Liz Mariana; Bolívar-Moná, Santiago; Jover T, Gabriela; Vargas C, Laura; Franco, Oscar H; Gómez-Restrepo, Carlos",Rev. colomb. psiquiatr,,472

Explanations for the crashes include: design flaws within the MAX's new flight control software system designed to prevent stalls; internal pressure to keep pace with Boeing's chief competitor, Airbus; Boeing's lack of transparency about the new software; and the lack of adequate monitoring of Boeing by the FAA, especially during the certification of the MAX and following the first crash. While these and other factors have been the subject of numerous government reports and investigative journalism articles, little to date has been written on the ethical significance of the accidents, in particular the ethical responsibilities of the engineers at Boeing and the FAA involved in designing and certifying the MAX. Lessons learned from this case include the need to strengthen the voice of engineers within large organizations. There is also the need for greater involvement of professional engineering societies in ethics-related activities and for broader focus on moral courage in engineering ethics education.","Herkert, Joseph; Borenstein, Jason; Miller, Keith",,,472

In this context, psychologists are mostly providers of this kind of service more than users. This study aimed at investigating and comparing post-hoc the subjective experience of psychotherapists, psychology trainees & students, and individuals of the general population who participated in a psychodynamically-oriented supportive group intervention. Fifty-two subjects were enrolled to participate to focus groups aimed at exploring participants' decision to participate, their perceptions on how the support group influenced their elaboration of the psychological effects of pandemic/lockdown, and their feedback on its utility. Transcripts of the focus groups were analyzed with the Linguistic Inquiry Word Count (LIWC). Differences in the use of words/linguistic categories between groups were tested through chisquare tests. Content analysis was conducted by independent judges who extracted the most relevant comments. Preliminary results showed the main features related to the crisis response, and how belonging to different social roles was associated with different ways of experiencing and sharing emotions. People react in different ways to traumatic events, and how people react may say a lot about how they cope with the event and the extent to which the event plays a role in the future. Clinical implications on the use of this data for future treatment planning are also discussed.

Urban density, infectious versus chronic disease, and the adaptive resilience of cities",2021,"BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: This article examines whether women are less prone than men to Covid-19 infections and their complications. DATA SOURCES: We reviewed available databases and searched systematically for publications. To be taken into account, data had to be broken down by gender. There was no study evaluation nor quantification synthesis, due to the large heterogeneity of the studies. Nineteen databases were selected. 73 publications were considered and 33 were selected, to which 12 more were added. RESULTS: Globally, the proportion of men and women who tested positive is comparable. However, men are about 60 % more likely to be severely ill or to die from the complications of Covid-19 than are women. LIMITATIONS: The study was hampered by a large heterogeneity in testing and reporting of the data. CONCLUSIONS: Although in the pandemic men die more frequently than women from Covid-19, it is not clear whether this is due to biological differences between men and women, differences in behavioral habits, or differences in the rates of co-morbidities. IMPLICATIONS OF KEY FINDINGS: Countries and studies should report their data by age, gender and co-morbidities. This may have implications in terms of vaccination strategies, the choice of treatments and future consequences for long-term health issues concerning gender equality.","Rozenberg, Serge; Vandromme, Jean; Martin, Charlotte",Maturitas,,472
438097,How Societies and Businesses Will Technologically Evolve with COVID-19,2021,"A rapid, accurate, and sensitive analytical method, ultrasonication-assisted spraying based fine droplet formation-liquid phase microextraction-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (UA-SFDF-LPME-GC-MS), was proposed for the determination of trace amounts of hydroxychloroquine sulfate in human serum, urine, and saliva samples. To determine the best extraction strategy, several liquid and solid phase extraction methods were investigated for their efficiencies in isolation and preconcentration of hydroxychloroquine sulfate from biological matrices. The UA-SFDF-LPME method was determined to be the best extraction method as it was operationally simple and provided accurate results. Variables such as the extraction solvent, spraying number, sodium hydroxide concentration and volume, sample volume, mixing method, and mixing period were optimized for the proposed method using the one-variable-at-a-time approach. In addition, Tukey's method based on a post hoc comparison test was employed to evaluate the significant difference between the parameters inspected. After the optimization studies, the limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) were determined to be 0.7 and 2.4 µg/kg, respectively. The sensitivity of the GC-MS system based on the LOD was enhanced approximately 440-fold when the UA-SFDF-LPME method was employed. Spiking experiments were also conducted for the human serum, urine, and saliva samples to determine the applicability and accuracy of the proposed method. Recoveries for the human serum, urine, and saliva samples were found to be in the ranges 94%-102%, 95%-105%, and 93%-102%, respectively. These results were satisfactory and indicated that the hydroxychloroquine sulfate level in the above biological samples could be analyzed using the proposed method.","Bodur, Süleyman; Erarpat, Sezin; Günkara, Ömer Tahir; Bakirdere, Sezgin",,,472

This necessitates the development of rapid genetic surveillance methodologies to serve as an adjunct with existing comprehensive, albeit though slower, genome sequencing-driven approaches. METHODS: A total of 21,789 complete genomes were downloaded from GISAID on May 28, 2020 for analyses. We have defined the major clades and subclades of circulating SARS-CoV-2 genomes. A rapid sequencing-based genotyping protocol was developed and tested on SARS-CoV-2-positive RNA samples by next-generation sequencing. RESULTS: We describe 11 major mutations which defined five major clades (G614, S84, V251, I378 and D392) of globally circulating viral populations. The clades can specifically identify using an 11-nucleotide genetic barcode. An analysis of amino acid variation in SARS-CoV-2 proteins provided evidence of substitution events in the viral proteins involved in both host entry and genome replication. CONCLUSION: Globally circulating SARS-CoV-2 genomes could be classified into 5 major clades based on mutational profiles defined by an 11-nucleotide barcode. We have successfully developed a multiplexed sequencing-based, rapid genotyping protocol for high-throughput classification of major clade types of SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples. This barcoding strategy will be required to monitor decreases in genetic diversity as treatment and vaccine approaches become widely available.","Guan, Qingtian; Sadykov, Mukhtar; Mfarrej, Sara; Hala, Sharif; Naeem, Raeece; Nugmanova, Raushan; Al-Omari, Awad; Salih, Samer; Mutair, Abbas Al; Carr, Michael J; Hall, William W; Arold, Stefan T; Pain, Arnab",Int J Infect Dis,,472

We conducted a survey on vaccinated healthcare workers (HCWs) inthree referral teaching hospitals in the Republic of Korea. We investigated the frequency of vaccination side effects (SEs), the impact on their work productivity, the need for medical attention, and vaccine acceptance. Three groups of HCWs were surveyed: 1406 who had received the first dose of BNT162b2 (BNT162b2#1), 1168 who had received the second dose of BNT162b2 (BNT162b2#2), and 1679 who had received the first dose of ChAdOx1 (ChAdOx1#1). More SEs and impact on work productivity were reported in ChAdOx1#1 than in the other two groups. However, among individuals aged ≥40 years, no significant difference of absence from work was found between ChAdOx1#1 and BN162b2#2 (4.4%, 31/699 vs. 3.0%, 12/405;p = 0.26), and none were hospitalized. Older HCWs in ChAdOx1#1 showed intention to receive the second dose of the vaccine. Although the incidence of SEs and their impacts were greater after the first dose of ChAdOx1 than BNT162b2 in young people, significant impact of SEs seemed to be rare in individuals aged ≥40 years, regardless of the vaccine they received.","Kim, Tark Park Se Yoon Yu Shinae Park Jung Wan Lee Eunjung Jeon Min Hyok Kim Tae Hyong Choo Eun Ju",Vaccines,,472

Tracheostomy placement is still a subject of controversy due to the poor prognosis of intubated patients and the risk of transmission to health care providers through this highly aerosolizing procedure. In this study we aim to determine the outcomes of tracheostomized patients with ARDS due to COVID-19 and ARDS to non-COVID-19. Methods: We performed a single center retrospective review of patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 and who underwent tracheostomy due to ARDS between January 2020 and November 2020. Patients were identified from our institutional database. Demographics, baseline comorbidities, mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) stay, duration of ventilator requirement, tracheostomy procedure details, complications, and length of stay. Results: The average time from endotracheal intubation to tracheostomy was 25.56 ± 7.58 days and 25.56 ± 6.35 days for SARS-CoV-2 positive and SARS-CoV-2 negative, respectively. In the SARS-CoV-2 positive group, eleven patients (32.4%) were liberated from the ventilator, six (17.6%) were decannulated, and nine (26.5%) remained on MV. In contrast, in the SARS-CoV-2 negative group five patients (27.8%) were liberated from the ventilator, eight (44.4%) were decannulated, and three (16.7%) remained on MV. The median time from tracheostomy to ventilator liberation was 19 days (range 10-41 days) and 32 days (range 24-49 days) for SARS-CoV-2 positive and SARS-CoV-2 negative, respectively. Of patients who were successfully decannulated, the average time to decannulation was 34.17 ± 16.88 days and 42.00 ± 13.01 days for SARS-CoV-2 positive and SARS-CoV-2 negative, respectively. There was no significant difference in mortality between both groups. Conclusions: In patients with ARDS, there are no statistical differences between SARS-CoV-2 positive and SARS-CoV-2 negative patients in terms of mortality, ventilator liberation, and decannulation time.","Ayala, A.; Uribe, J.

441427,Laos in 2020: Reaping a Harvest of Unity and Debt,2021,"SARS-CoV-2 virus represents a health threat in food factories. This infectious virus is transmitted by direct contact and indirectly via airborne route, whereas contamination through inanimate objects/surfaces/equipment is uncertain. To limit the potential spread of the pathogen in the food industry, close working between individuals should be avoided and both personal and respiratory hygiene activities should be enforced. Despite the high infectivity, SARS-CoV-2, being an enveloped virus with a fragile lipid envelop, is sensitive to biocidal products and sanitizers commonly used in the food factory. In the context of the building design, interventions that promote healthy air quality should be adopted, especially in food areas with high-occupancy rates for prolonged times, to help minimize the potential exposure to airborne SARS-CoV-2. Air ventilation and filtration provided by heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems, are effective and easy-to-organize tools to reduce the risk of transmission through the air. In addition to conventional sanitation protocols, aerosolization of hydrogen peroxide, UV-C irradiation or in-situ ozone generation are complementary techniques for an effective virucidal treatment of the air.","Masotti, Fabio; Cattaneo, Stefano; Stuknyte, Milda; Pica, Valentina; De Noni, Ivano",Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr,,472
441727,Ten Tips for Running an Online Conference,2020,"With current COVID-19 vaccine demand outweighing supply and the emergency authorization/rollout of three novel vaccines in the United States, discussions continue regarding fair prioritization among various groups for this scarce resource. The US federal government's recommended vaccination schedule, meant to assist states with vaccine allocation, demonstrates fair ethical considerations; however, difficulties remain comparing various groups to determine fair vaccine access and distribution. Although strides have been taken to analyze risks versus benefits of early vaccination across certain high-risk populations, prioritizing vulnerable populations versus essential workers remains challenging for multiple reasons. Similarly, as COVID-19 vaccine allocation and distribution continues in the US and in other countries, topics that require continued consideration include sub-prioritization among currently prioritized groups, prioritization among vulnerable groups disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, like ethnic minorities, and holistic comparisons between groups who might receive various and disparate benefits from vaccination. Although all current COVID-19 vaccines are emergency authorization use only and a vaccine mandate would be considered only once these vaccines are licensed by the US Food and Drug Administration, future vaccination policies require time and deliberation. Similarly, given current vaccine hesitancy, mandatory vaccination of certain groups, like healthcare personnel, may need to be considered when these vaccines are licensed, especially if voluntary vaccination proves insufficient. Continued discussions regarding risks versus benefits of mandatory COVID-19 vaccination and the unique role of healthcare personnel in providing a safe healthcare environment could lead to better deliberation regarding potential policies. This commentary aims to address both questions of fair prioritization and sub-prioritization of various groups, as well as ethical considerations for mandatory COVID-19 vaccination among healthcare personnel.","Hughes, Katarina; Gogineni, Vinaya; Lewis, Chandani; Deshpande, Abhishek",Curr Med Res Opin,,472

Furthermore, the most appropriate corticosteroid and dose in the treatment of COVID-19 have remained uncertain. We conducted a study to assess the effectiveness of methylprednisolone treatment versus dexamethasone for hospitalized COVID-19 patients. METHODS: In this prospective triple-blinded randomized controlled trial, we enrolled 86 hospitalized COVID-19 patients from August to November 2020, in Shiraz, Iran. The patients were randomly allocated into two groups to receive either methylprednisolone (2 mg/kg/day; intervention group) or dexamethasone (6 mg/kg/day; control group). Data were assessed based on a 9-point WHO ordinal scale extending from uninfected (point 0) to death (point 8). RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the groups on admission. However, the intervention group demonstrated significantly better clinical status compared to the control group at day 5 (4.02 vs. 5.21, p = 0.002) and day 10 (2.90 vs. 4.71, p = 0.001) of admission. There was also a significant difference in the overall mean score between the intervention group and the control group, (3.909 vs. 4.873 respectively, p = 0.004). The mean length of hospital stay was 7.43 ± 3.64 and 10.52 ± 5.47 days in the intervention and control groups, respectively (p = 0.015). The need for a ventilator was significantly lower in the intervention group than in the control group (18.2% vs 38.1% p = 0.040).

442078,Practical Functioning of a Sustainable Urban Complex with a Park—The Case Study of Stavros Niarchos Foundation Cultural Center in Athens,2021,"Deep learning based medical image segmentation is an important step within diagnosis, which relies strongly on capturing sufficient spatial context without requiring too complex models that are hard to train with limited labelled data. Training data is in particular scarce for segmenting infection regions of CT images of COVID-19 patients. Attention models help gather contextual information within deep networks and benefit semantic segmentation tasks. The recent criss-cross-attention module aims to approximate global self-attention while remaining memory and time efficient by separating horizontal and vertical self-similarity computations. However, capturing attention from all non-local locations can adversely impact the accuracy of semantic segmentation networks. We propose a new Dynamic Deformable Attention Network (DDANet) that enables a more accurate contextual information computation in a similarly efficient way. Our novel technique is based on a deformable criss-cross attention block that learns both attention coefficients and attention offsets in a continuous way. A deep U-Net (Schlemper et al., 2019) segmentation network that employs this attention mechanism is able to capture attention from pertinent non-local locations and also improves the performance on semantic segmentation tasks compared to criss-cross attention within a U-Net on a challenging COVID-19 lesion segmentation task. Our validation experiments show that the performance gain of the recursively applied dynamic deformable attention blocks comes from their ability to capture dynamic and precise attention context. Our DDANet achieves Dice scores of 73.4% and 61.3% for Ground-glass opacity and consolidation lesions for COVID-19 segmentation and improves the accuracy by 4.9% points compared to a baseline U-Net and 24.4% points compared to current state of art methods (Fan et al., 2020).","Rajamani, Kumar T; Siebert, Hanna; Heinrich, Mattias P",J Biomed Inform,,472
442699,Managing regional logistics in times of crisis: a COVID-19 case study,2021,"Background: Childhood obesity is an ever-growing public health concern in the United States and globally. By 2030, it is estimated that 70% of the world's population of children and adolescents will be obese. Therefore, efforts to reduce childhood obesity are of utmost importance, particularly with the current coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, as rates are expected to soar due to social distancing measures and restrictions. This systematic review aims to examine the literature regarding the effectiveness of clinic-based telehealth vs. face-to-face modalities to reduce obesity among school-aged children. Methods: An electronic database search of articles published in English over the last 10 years was undertaken in PubMed, Medline, and CINAHL. Key terms used to identify studies included school-aged children and adolescents with overweight and obesity in clinic-based weight management interventions conducted face-to-face or via telehealth, and having efficacy determined through changes in measured child BMI as primary outcomes and dietary and physical activity changes, as well as assessing feasibility and satisfaction with telehealth, as secondary outcomes. Results: Out of 1093 articles identified, 10 met the inclusion criteria. While both telehealth and face-to-face weight management interventions are effective in reducing obesity in children and adolescents, the evidence is lacking in which is more effective. Of the 10 studies, 5 showed outcome improvements when both telehealth and face-to-face interventions were combined as adjunct therapies.

442735,A General Method for Event Detection on Social Media,2021-06-04,"OBJECTIVE: The main objective of this revision is to summarize the current existing evidence of the potential adverse effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the male reproductive system and provide the recommendations of the Asociacion Espanola de Andrologia, Medicina Sexual y Reproductiva (ASESA) concerning the implications of COVID-19 infection in the management of male infertilty patients and testicular endocrine dysfunction METHODS: A comprehensive systematic literature search of the databases of PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Medline, Cochrane and MedRxiv, was carried out RESULTS: The presence of orchitis as a potential complication of the infection by SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been confirmed One study reported that 19% of males with COVID-19 infection had scrotal symptoms suggestive of viral orchitis which could not be confirmed It is possible that the virus, rather than infecting the testes directly, may induce a secondary autoimmune response leading to autoimmune orchitis COVID-19 has been associated with coagulation disorders and thus the orchitis could be the result of segmental vasculitis Existing data concerning the presence of the virus in semen are contradictory Only one study reported the presence of RNA in 15 8% of patients with COVID-19 However, the presence of nucleic acid or antigen in semen is not synonyms of viral replication capacity and infectivity It has been reported an increase in serum levels of LH in males with COVID-19 and a significant reduction in the T/LH and FSH/LH ratios, consistent with subclinical hypogonadism CONCLUSIONS: The findings of recent reports related to the potential effects of COVID-19 infection on the male reproductive system are based on poorly designed, small sample size studies that provide inconclusive, contradictory results Since there still exists a theoretical possibility of testicular damage and male infertilty as a result of the infection by COVID-19, males of reproductive age should be evaluated for gonadal function and semen analysis With regard to the sexual transmission of the virus, there is not sufficient evidence to recommend asymptomatic couples to abstein from having sex in order to protect themselves from being infected by the virus Additional studies are needed to understand the long-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 on male reproductive function, including male fertility potential and endocrine testicular function","Jose, F.

442897,Disruption and dislocation in post-COVID futures for digital health,2020,"Chemical reaction networks (CRNs) are directed graphs with reactant or product complexes as vertices, and reactions as arcs. A CRN is weakly reversible if each of its connected components is strongly connected. Weakly reversible networks can be considered as the most important class of reaction networks. Now, the stoichiometric subspace of a network is the linear span of the reaction vectors (i.e., difference between the product and the reactant complexes). A decomposition of a CRN is independent (incidence independent) if the direct sum of the stoichiometric subspaces (incidence maps) of the subnetworks equals the stoichiometric subspace (incidence map) of the whole network. Decompositions can be used to study relationships between steady states of the whole system (induced from partitioning the reaction set of the underlying network) and those of its subsystems. In this work, we revisit our novel method of finding independent decomposition, and use it to expand applicability on (vector) components of steady states. We also explore CRNs with embedded deficiency zero independent subnetworks. In addition, we establish a method for finding incidence independent decomposition of a CRN. We determine all the forms of independent and incidence independent decompositions of a network, and provide the number of such decompositions. Lastly, for weakly reversible networks, we determine that incidence independence is a sufficient condition for weak reversibility of a decomposition, and we identify subclasses of weakly reversible networks where any independent decomposition is weakly reversible.","Hernandez, Bryan S.; Amistas, Deza A.; Cruz, Ralph John L.

443879,Letter from the (un)seen virus: (post)humanist perspective in corona times,2020,"COVID-19–related morbidity is associated with exaggerated inflammation and cytokine production in the lungs, leading to acute respiratory failure. The cellular mechanisms underlying these so-called ‘cytokine storms’ are regulated through the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling pathway and by ROS (Reactive Oxygen Species). Both light (Photobiomodulation) and magnetic fields (e.g., Pulsed Electro Magnetic Field) stimulation are noninvasive therapies known to confer anti-inflammatory effects and regulate ROS signaling pathways. Here we show that daily exposure to two 10-minute intervals of moderate intensity infra-red light significantly lowered the inflammatory response induced via the TLR4 receptor signaling pathway in human cell cultures. Anti-inflammatory effects were likewise achieved by electromagnetic field exposure of cells to daily 10-minute intervals of either Pulsed Electromagnetic Fields (PEMF), or to Low-Level static magnetic fields. Because current illumination and electromagnetic field therapies have no known side effects, and are already approved for some medical uses, we have here developed protocols for verification in clinical trials of COVID-19 infection. These treatments are affordable, simple to implement, and may help to resolve the acute respiratory distress of COVID-19 patients both in the home and in the hospital. © 2021 The Author(s).

A new pandemic of the 21st century,2020,"Studies documenting coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) racial/ethnic disparities in the United States were limited to data from the initial few months of the pandemic, did not account for changes over time, and focused primarily on Black and Hispanic minority groups. To fill these gaps, we examined time trends in racial/ethnic disparities in COVID-19 infection and mortality. We used the Veteran Health Administration's (VHA) national database of veteran COVID-19 infections over three time periods: 3/1/2020-5/31/2020 (spring); 6/1/2020-8/31/2020 (summer); and 9/1/2020-11/25/2020 (fall). We calculated COVID-19 infection and mortality predicted probabilities from logistic regression models that included time period-by-race/ethnicity interaction terms, and controlled for age, gender, and prior diagnosis of CDC risk factors. Racial/ethnic groups at higher risk for COVID-19 infection and mortality changed over time. American Indian/Alaskan Natives (AI/AN), Blacks, Hispanics, and Native Hawaiians/Other Pacific Islanders experienced higher COVID-19 infections compared to Whites during the summertime. There were mortality disparities for Blacks in springtime, and AI/ANs, Asians, and Hispanics in summertime. Policy makers should consider the dynamic nature of racial/ethnic disparities as the pandemic evolves, and potential effects of risk mitigation and other (e.g., economic) policies on these disparities. Researchers should consider how trends in disparities change over time in other samples.","Wong, Michelle S; Haderlein, Taona P; Yuan, Anita H; Moy, Ernest; Jones, Kenneth T; Washington, Donna L",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,472

Among these mutations are amino acid changes N501Y (lineage B.1.1.7, first identified in the UK), and the combination N501Y, E484K, K417N (B.1.351, first identified in South Africa), all located at the interface on the receptor binding domain (RBD). We experimentally establish that RBD containing the N501Y mutation results in 7-fold stronger binding to the hACE2 receptor than wild type RBD. The E484K mutation only slightly enhances the affinity for the receptor, while K417N attenuates affinity. As a result, RBD from B.1.351 containing all three mutations binds 3-fold stronger to hACE2 than wild type RBD but 2-fold weaker than N501Y. However, the recently emerging double mutant E484K/N501Y binds even stronger than N501Y. The independent evolution of lineages containing mutations with different effects on receptor binding affinity, viral transmission and immune evasion underscores the importance of global viral genome surveillance and functional characterization.","Laffeber, Charlie; de Koning, Kelly; Kanaar, Roland; Lebbink, Joyce H G",J Mol Biol,,472

445693,"Re-visiting design thinking for learning and practice: Critical pedagogy, conative empathy",2021,"Background: Measures introduced to delay the spread of COVID-19 may result in avoidance of emergency departments (EDs) for non-COVID related illness. Clinicians and medical representative bodies such as the Irish Association for Emergency Medicine (IAEM) have expressed concern that some patients may not seek timely urgent medical intervention. Evidence from previous epidemics found that hospital avoidance during outbreaks of MERS and SARS was common. While ED attendance returned to normal following SARS and MERS, both outbreaks lasted 2-3 months. As the COVID-19 pandemic is forecast to extend into 2021, little is known about the impact COVID-19 will have on paediatric attendance at EDs as the pandemic evolves. Aims: This project aims to assess the impact of COVID-19 on paediatric emergency healthcare utilisation, to understand how the health seeking behaviour of parents may have altered due to the pandemic, and to identify how any barriers to accessing care can be removed. Methods: Administrative data records from five EDs across Ireland and one Urgent Care Centre will be analysed to identify changes in attendances at emergency healthcare. Qualitative inquiry will be utilised to capture the experience of staff providing emergency healthcare to paediatric patients during COVID-19, and their feedback on identified trends will inform the interpretation of findings. A cross-sectional survey of parents will capture experiences, concerns and decision-making on accessing healthcare for their children during the pandemic. Results and Conclusion: This information will help decision makers respond rapidly to meet the clinical needs of paediatric patients as the circumstances of the pandemic unfold and reduce the disruption to normal paediatric ED services during the onset of COVID-19. As the health of a child can deteriorate more rapidly than that of an adult, any delay in seeking care for an acutely ill child may have serious consequences.","McDonnell, Thérèse; McAuliffe, Eilish; Barrett, Michael; Conlon, Ciara; Cummins, Fergal; Deasy, Conor; Hensey, Conor; Martin, Ciara; Nicholson, Emma",HRB Open Res,,472

Influenza is not causally associated with COVID-19, but shares population-based determinants, such as similar incidence/mortality trends, transmission patterns, efficacy of non-pharmaceutical interventions, comorbidities and underdiagnosis. We investigated the ecologic association between influenza mortality rates and COVID-19 mortality rates in the European context. We considered the 3-year average influenza (2014-2016) and COVID-19 (31 May 2020) crude mortality rates in 34 countries using EUROSTAT and ECDC databases and performed correlation and regression analyses. The two variables - log transformed, showed significant Spearman's correlation &#961; = 0.439 (P = 0.01), and regression coefficients, b = 0.743 (95% confidence interval, 0.272-1.214; R2 = 0.244; P = 0.003), b = 0.472 (95% confidence interval, 0.067-0.878; R2 = 0.549; P = 0.02), unadjusted and adjusted for confounders (population size and cardiovascular disease mortality), respectively. Common significant determinants of both COVID-19 and influenza mortality rates were life expectancy, influenza vaccination in the elderly (direct associations), number of hospital beds per population unit and crude cardiovascular disease mortality rate (inverse associations). This analysis suggests that influenza mortality rates were independently associated with COVID-19 mortality rates in Europe, with implications for public health preparedness, and implies preliminary undetected SARS-CoV-2 spread in Europe.","Petti, S; Cowling, B J",Epidemiol Infect,,472

However, little is known about children's emotional/behavioral problems, especially externalizing problems, during such situations. This prospective cohort study aimed to investigate pandemic-related emotional/behavioral problems and their risk factors among schoolchildren in Japan. Methods A total of 4800 parents with children in grades 1?12 participated in a two-wave longitudinal survey. Wave 1 and Wave 2 were conducted on March 4?8 and May 15?18, 2020, respectively. Survey items included demographic information, parental depression, children's diagnoses of neurodevelopmental disorders, the total length of school closure, and emotional/behavioral problems. Children's emotional/behavioral problems were assessed using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), which has cutoff points to differentiate clinical-level problems, which were the primary focus of this study. Results The proportions of clinical-level problems were higher at Wave 2 (emotional symptoms = 24.8%, conduct problems = 22.7%, hyperactivity/inattention = 36.8%, peer relationship problems = 36.2%, and lack of prosocial behavior = 23.5%) compared to Wave 1. Lower grade-level and lower annual family income predicted the increased proportions of children's clinical-level emotional symptoms, hyperactivity/inattention, and prosocial behavior at Wave 2. The total length of school closure was not a significant predictor of subsequent emotional/behavioral problems. The highest proportion of clinical-level problems at Wave 2 for the four SDQ subscales was observed in children with neurodevelopmental disorders. Conclusions The number of schoolchildren with severe emotional/behavioral problems increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Appropriate prevention and early intervention programs should be provided, especially for children who are in lower grade levels, have low family incomes, or have neurodevelopmental disorders.","Takahashi, Fumito Honda Hideo",JCPP Advances,,472

Education and environment after the coronavirus,2020,"The diagnosis of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) relies on the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2) RNA by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction in respiratory samples. Rapid increase in the COVID-19 cases across the world requires fast and efficient testing as testing capacity is a bottleneck in diagnosis. In this context, pooling strategy can be opted for rapid testing in a cost-effective manner. In this study, the authors have optimized and compared the effect of pooling (5 and 10 samples) before and after nucleic acid extraction. It was concluded that there was no significant difference in the SARS CoV-2 RNA detection in the pools prepared at sample or RNA level. Even after pooling, 10-fold dilution was detectable with 3-cycle threshold value change in both type of pools when compared with individual samples. Hence, sample pool size of 10 can be used in low-prevalent areas, and testing capacity can be substantially increased.","Chhikara, Komal; Kanta, Poonam; Ghosh, Arnab; Prakash, Rishi Chetanya; Goyal, Kapil; Singh, Mini P",Diagn Microbiol Infect Dis,,472

Recent advancements of digital bioassay revolutionized ALP-based diagnostic assays as seen in rapid growth of digital ELISA and the emerging multiplex profiling of single-molecule ALP isomers. However, the intrinsic heterogeneity found among ALP molecules hampers the ALP-based quantitative digital bioassays. This study aims quantitative analysis of single-molecule activities of ALP from Escherichia coli and reveals the static heterogeneity in catalytic activity of ALP with two distinct populations: half-active and fully-active portions. Digital assays with serial buffer exchange uncovered single-molecule Michaelis-Menten kinetics of ALP; half-active molecules have halved values of the catalytic turnover rate, kcat , and the rate constant of productive binding, kon , of the fully active molecules. These findings suggest that half-active ALP molecules are heterogenic dimers composed of inactive and active monomer units, while fully active ALP molecules comprise two active units. Static heterogeneity was also observed for ALP with other origins: calf intestine or shrimp, showing how the findings can be generalized across species. Cell-free expression of ALP with disulfide bond enhancer and spiked zinc ion resulted in homogenous population of ALP of full activity, implying that inactive monomer units of ALP are deficient in correct disulfide bond formation and zinc ion coordination. These findings provide basis for further study on molecular mechanism and biogenesis of ALP, and also offer the way to prepare homogenous and active populations of ALP for highly quantitative and sensitive bioassays with ALP.

455959,Explanatory Analysis of Factors Influencing the Support for Sustainable Food Production and Distribution Systems: Results from a Rural Canadian Community,2021,"The increasing prevalence of variant lineages during the COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to disrupt molecular diagnostics due to mismatches between primers and variant templates. Point-of-care molecular diagnostics, which often lack the complete functionality of their high throughput laboratory counterparts, are particularly susceptible to this type of disruption, which can result in false negative results. To address this challenge, we have developed a robust Loop Mediated Isothermal Amplification assay with single tube multiplexed multi-target redundancy and an internal amplification control. A convenient and cost-effective target specific fluorescence detection system allows amplifications to be grouped by signal using adaptable probes for pooled reporting of SARS-COV-2 target amplifications or differentiation of the Internal Amplification Control. Over the course of the pandemic, primer coverage of viral lineages by the three redundant sub-assays has varied from assay to assay as they have diverged from the Wuhan-Hu-1 isolate sequence, but aggregate coverage has remained high for all variant sequences analyzed, with a minimum of 97.4% (Variant of Interest: Eta). In three instances (Delta, Gamma, Eta), a high frequency mismatch with one of the three sub-assays was observed, but overall coverage remained high due to multi-target redundancy. When challenged with extracted human samples the multiplexed assay showed 100% sensitivity for samples containing greater than 30 copies of viral RNA per reaction, and 100% specificity. These results are further evidence that conventional laboratory methodologies can be leveraged at the point-of-care for robust performance and diagnostic stability over time.","Kline, Enos C; Panpradist, Nuttada; Hull, Ian T; Wang, Qin; Oreskovic, Amy K; Han, Peter D; Starita, Lea M; Lutz, Barry R",,,472

Early classification of COVID-19 is essential for disease cure and control. Transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is used widely for the detection of COVID-19. However, its high cost, time-consuming and low sensitivity will significantly reduce the diagnosis efficiency and increase the difficulty of diagnosis for COVID-19. For X-ray images of COVID-19 patients have high inter-class similarity and low intra-class variability, we specifically designed a multi attention interaction enhancement module (MAIE) and proposed a new convolutional neural network, MAI-Net, based on this module. As a lightweight network, MAI-Net has fewer layers and amount of network parameters than other network models, enabling more efficient detection of COVID-19. To verify the performance of the model, MAINet performed a comparison experiment on two open-source datasets. The experimental results show that its overall accuracy and COVID-19 category accuracy are 96.42% and 100%, respectively, and the sensitivity of COVID-19 is 99.02%. Considering the factors such as accuracy rate, the parameters number of network model and the calculation amount, MAI-Net has better practicability.

This paper explores how fit-for-purpose methods for establishing and upgrading land administration infrastructures have become increasingly imperative to developing countries, particularly small island developing states (SIDS) of the Caribbean, in light of declining economies. The experiences of Caribbean countries, with a focus on Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados, Saint Lucia, and Jamaica, in implementing adjudication and titling for their land administration, are compared to FFPLA guidelines in terms of major objectives, supportive legislation, and method of application. Based on the outcomes of the evaluation, it is suggested that including more facets of the FFPLA, primarily for progressing the process toward economically beneficial success, would be an advantage. © 2021 by the author.

456876,Quantifying the Impacts of COVID-19 Lockdown and Spring Festival on Air Quality over Yangtze River Delta Region,2021,"OBJECTIVE: The study aims to determine whether ED presentation volume or hospital occupancy had a greater impact on ED performance before and during the COVID-19 health response at a tertiary referral hospital in Sydney, Australia. METHODS: Single centre time series analysis using routinely collected hospital and ED data from January 2019 to September 2020. The primary outcome was ED access block measured by emergency treatment performance (ETP; i.e. percentage of patients who were discharged or transferred to a ward from ED within 4 h of ED arrival time). Secondary outcomes were hospital occupancy, elective theatre cases and ambulance ramping. Multivariate time series analysis was performed using vector autoregression, to model effects of changes in various endogenous and correlated variables on ETP. RESULTS: There was an increase in ETP, drop in ED presentations and decrease in hospital occupancy between April and June 2020. Elective surgery and hospital occupancy had significant effects up to 2 days prior on ETP, while there were no significant effects of either ED or ambulance presentations on ETP. Hospital occupancy itself increased with ED presentations after 2-4 days and decreased with elective surgery after 1 day. Shocks (a one standard deviation increase) in hospital occupancy had a peak impact nearly two times greater compared to ED presentations (-1.43, 95% confidence interval -1.92, -0.93 vs -0.73, 95% confidence interval -1.21, -0.25). CONCLUSION: The main determinants of the reduction of ED overcrowding and access block during the pandemic were associated with reductions in hospital occupancy and elective surgery levels, and more research is required to assess more complex associations beyond the scope of this manuscript.","Bein, Kendall J; Berendsen Russell, Saartje; Ní Bhraonáin, Sinéad; Seimon, Radhika V; Dinh, Michael M",Emerg. med Australas,,472
458406,Global plastic waste management strategies (Technical and behavioral) during and after COVID-19 pandemic for cleaner global urban life,2021,"OBJECTIVE: There are limited data regarding the typical characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients requiring interfacility transport or the clinical capabilities of the out-of-hospital transport clinicians required to provide safe transport. The objective of this study is to provide epidemiologic data and highlight the clinical skill set and decision making needed to transport critically ill COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of persons under investigation for COVID-19 transported during the first 6 months of the pandemic by Johns Hopkins Lifeline was performed. Patients who required interfacility transport and tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 by polymerase chain reaction assay were included in the analysis. RESULTS: Sixty-eight patients (25.4%) required vasopressor support, 35 patients (13.1%) were pharmacologically paralyzed, 15 (5.60%) were prone, and 1 (0.75%) received an inhaled pulmonary vasodilator. At least 1 ventilator setting change occurred for 59 patients (22.0%), and ventilation mode was changed for 11 patients (4.10%) during transport. CONCLUSION: The safe transport of critically ill patients with COVID-19 requires experience with vasopressors, paralytic medications, inhaled vasodilators, prone positioning, and ventilator management. The frequency of initiated critical interventions and ventilator adjustments underscores the tenuous nature of these patients and highlights the importance of transport clinician reassessment, critical thinking, and decision making.","Troncoso, Ruben D; Garfinkel, Eric M; Leon, David; Lopez, Sandra M; Lin, Andrew; Jones, Dennis; Trautman, Shawn; Levy, Matthew J; Margolis, Asa M",Air Med J,,472

The effect of the pandemic on emergency general surgery patients remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: To reveal the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mortality and morbidity among emergency general surgery cases. DESIGN AND SETTING: Data on patients who were admitted to the emergency department of a tertiary hospital in Samsun, Turkey, and had consultations at the general surgery clinic were analyzed retrospectively. METHODS: Our study included comparative analysis on two groups of patients who received emergency general surgery consultations in our hospital: during the COVID-19 pandemic period (Group 2); and on the same dates one year previously (Group 1). RESULTS: There were 195 patients in Group 1 and 132 in Group 2 (P < 0.001). While 113 (58%) of the patients in Group 1 were women, only 58 (44%) were women in Group 2 (P = 0.013). Considering all types of diagnosis, there was no significant difference between the two groups (P = 0.261). The rates of abscess and delayed abdominal emergency diseases were higher in Group 2: one case (0.5%) versus ten cases (8%); P < 0.001. The morbidity rate was higher in Group 2 than in Group 1: three cases (1.5%) versus nine cases (7%); P = 0.016. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has decreased the number of unnecessary nonemergency admissions to the emergency department, but has not delayed patients' urgent consultations. The pandemic has led surgeons to deal with more complicated cases and greater numbers of complications.","Tarim, Ismail Alper; Derebey, Murat; Özbalci, Gökhan Selçuk; Özsay, Oguzhan; Yüksek, Mahmut Arif; Büyükakincak, Sercan; Bircan, Recep; Güngör, Bahadir Bülent; Basoglu, Mahmut",Sao Paulo med. j,,472

461381,A Community Springs to Action to Enable Virtual Laboratory Instruction,2020,"INTRODUCTION: The promotion of mental health well-being among global adolescent populations is of great public health and social significance. This is particularly true for adolescents living with chronic illnesses as studies have shown that these populations are at higher risk for developing mental health problems. There is vast recognition of the need for age and culturally appropriate interventions to promote mental well-being and prevent mental health problems. In stark contrast, there is a dearth of relevant measures of mental well-being for adolescents. Our proposed systematic review aims to identify measures of mental well-being and to assess content, psychometric properties and relevance to adolescent populations. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The systematic review methodology will be guided by the seven steps proposed by Eggar, Davey and Smith. Documents will be sourced from electronic databases (Academic Search Complete, Educational Resource Information Center, Medical Literature Analysis Retrieval System Online, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature plus, PsyArticles, SocIndex and Sabinet). All documents will be exported to Mendeley and two reviewers will independently screen the titles, abstracts and full texts for inclusion. Any discrepancies will be resolved by a third party. We will include studies published in all languages from 2000 to 2020, that use an instrument(s) that measure mental well-being among adolescent populations. Studies reporting on clinically significant mental illnesses or disorders will be excluded. A descriptive meta-synthesis approach will be used to identify and describe the mental health instruments used among adolescent populations, and to report on the psychometric properties. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval is not required. The results of this review will be disseminated through a peer-reviewed publication as well as conference presentations.","Orth, Zaida; van Wyk, Brian",BMJ Open,,472

463505,Influences of climate change on tourism development in small pacific island states,2021,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) associates with a considerable high rate of mortality and represents currently the most important concern in global health. The risk of more severe clinical manifestation of COVID-19 is higher in males and steeply raised with age but also increased by the presence of chronic comorbidities. Among the latter, early reports suggested that arterial hypertension associates with higher susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection, more severe course and increased COVID-19-related deaths. Furthermore, experimental studies suggested that key pathophysiological hypertension mechanisms, such as activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), may play a role in COVID-19. In fact, ACE2 (angiotensin-converting-enzyme 2) is the pivotal receptor for SARS-CoV-2 to enter host cells and provides thus a link between COVID-19 and RAS. It was thus anticipated that drugs modulating the RAS including an upregulation of ACE2 may increase the risk for infection with SARS-CoV-2 and poorer outcomes in COVID-19. Since the use of RAS-blockers, ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, represents the backbone of recommended antihypertensive therapy and intense debate about their use in the COVID-19 pandemic has developed. Currently, a direct role of hypertension, independent of age and other comorbidities, as a risk factor for the SARS-COV-2 infection and COVID-19 outcome, particularly death, has not been established. Similarly, both current experimental and clinical studies do not support an unfavorable effect of RAS-blockers or other classes of first line blood pressure lowering drugs in COVID-19. Here, we review available data on the role of hypertension and its management on COVID-19. Conversely, some aspects as to how the COVID-19 affects hypertension management and impacts on future developments are also briefly discussed. COVID-19 has and continues to proof the critical importance of hypertension research to address questions that are important for global health.","Savoia, Carmine; Volpe, Massimo; Kreutz, Reinhold",Circ Res,,472

We sought to investigate whether visit-to-visit HbA1c variability is a potential predictor of ISR in diabetic patients after stent implantation. METHODS: We consecutively enrolled type 2 diabetic patients who underwent successful elective percutaneous coronary intervention and performed follow-up coronary angiography after around 12 months. The incidence of ISR and its relationship with visit-to-visit HbA1c variability, expressed as coefficient of variation (CV), standard deviation (SD) and variability independent of the mean (VIM), were studied. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were constructed to analyze the predictive value of HbA1c variability for ISR. RESULTS: From September 2014 to July 2018 in Ruijin Hospital, a total of 420 diabetic patients (688 lesions) after stent implantation were included in the final analysis. During a mean follow-up of 12.8 ± 1.3 months, the incidence of ISR was 8.6%, which was significantly increased in patients with higher CV of HbA1c (P = 0.001). The mean diameter stenosis (DS), net luminal loss and net luminal gain were 22.9 ± 16.8%, 0.42 ± 0.88 mm and 1.66 ± 0.83 mm, respectively. Greater DS was observed in subjects with higher tertiles of CV of HbA1c (P < 0.001), and this trend was more prominent in patients with optimal glycemic control (HbA1c &#8804; 7%) in the baseline. In multivariate analysis, HbA1c variability was independently associated with incidence of ISR after adjustment for traditional risk factors and mean HbA1c (HR: 3.00 [95% CI 1.14-7.92] for highest vs. lowest tertile). Inclusion of CV of HbA1c led to a better risk stratification accuracy. Assessing HbA1c variability by SD or VIM yielded similar findings. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that visit-to-visit HbA1c variability is an independent predictor of incidence of ISR in patients with type 2 diabetes after stent implantation.

A retrospective study was conducted that consisted of a primary cohort with 315 COVID-19 patients and two validation cohorts with 69 and 123 patients, respectively. Logistic regression analyses were used to identify the independent risks of progression to critical. An individualized prediction model was developed, and calibration, decision curve, and clinical impact curves were used to assess the performance of the model. External validations for the predictive nomogram were also provided. The variables of age, comorbid diseases, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, d-dimer, C-reactive protein, and platelet count were estimated to be independent predictors of progression to critical, which were incorporated to establish a model of the nomogram. It demonstrated good discrimination (with a C-index of 0.923) and calibration. Good discrimination (C-index, 0.882 and 0.906) and calibration were also noted on applying the nomogram in two validation cohorts. The clinical relevance of the nomogram was justified by the decision curve and clinical impact curve analysis. This study presents an individualized prediction nomogram incorporating six clinical characteristics, which can be conveniently applied to assess an individual's risk of progressing to critical COVID-19.","Xu, Ranran; Cui, Junwei; Hu, Liu; Wang, Yiru; Wang, Tao; Ye, Dawei; Lv, Yongman; Liu, Qingquan",J Med Virol,,472

Ces tests ont permis de relever différents points intéressants (réponses des MG uniquement) : la majorité (90 %) utilisait Antibioclic® ;dans l’OMA de l’enfant, 63 % citaient à la fois la bonne molécule et la bonne durée ;près de 2/3 sous-estimaient la fréquence de la colonisation urinaire en EHPAD et 60 % la traitaient en préopératoire;devant l’association fièvre et bandelette urinaire (BU) positive, en l’absence d’autres symptômes, le diagnostic d’IU était jugé probable par près de 33 % des MG, 46 % réalisant un ECBU. En cas de confusion et BU positive, le diagnostic d’IU était jugé probable par 40 % des MG et l’ECBU réalisé dans 57 % des cas ;chez une patiente obèse diabétique présentant un érysipèle, 77 % instauraient de l’amoxicilline (dont 60 % à posologie suffisante) et 13 % de l’amoxicilline–acide clavulanique. Tous ATB confondus, 64 % traitaient pendant 7 jours ;plus de 50 % des répondants sous-estimaient l’incidence de la contamination par les papillomavirus en population générale ;l’impossibilité de réévaluer le patient et le terrain débilité étaient les deux facteurs les plus susceptibles d’influencer la décision de prescrire un ATB avant tout examen clinique. Conclusion Le contexte sanitaire pousse chacun à s’adapter et à innover. La formation en ligne a l’avantage de toucher un public large, notamment les professionnels isolés, et de dépasser les frontières régionales. Peu chronophage et délivrant quelques messages clés, le format court est adapté à l’activité des MG, tout comme le réalisme des situations abordées. Ces tests permettent de maintenir le lien avec les professionnels de terrain et d’orienter les futures actions des antibio-référents. Reste à diffuser plus largement encore ce type de formation.","Boutfol, W.; Imboula, E.; Thibaut, S.; Cormier, H.; Abgueguen, P.; Boutoille, D.",Infectious Diseases Now,,472

468581,"Innovation of startups, the key to unlocking post-crisis sustainable growth in Romanian entrepreneurial ecosystem",2021,"COVID-19 has significantly affected universities, forcing many courses to be delivered entirely online. As countries bring the pandemic under control, a potential way to safely resume some face-to-face teaching is the synchronous hybrid classroom, in which physically and remotely attending students are taught simultaneously. This comes with challenges, however, including the risk that remotely attending students perceive a 'gap' between their engagement and that of their physical peers. In this experience report, we describe how an interactive programming course was adapted to hybrid delivery in a way that mitigated this risk. Our solution centred on the use of a professional communication platform - Slack - to equalise participation opportunities and to facilitate peer learning. Furthermore, to mitigate 'Zoom fatigue', we implemented a semi-flipped classroom, covering concepts in videos and using shorter lessons to consolidate them. Finally, we critically reflect on the results of a student survey and our own experiences of implementing the solution.","Poskitt, Christopher M.; Shim, Kyong Jin; Lau, Yi Meng; Ong, Hong Seng",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.09073v1.pdf,472
469369,Improvements in air quality in the Netherlands during the corona lockdown based on observations and model simulations,2021,"Research background: In determining the prices in road transport, carriers usually use the calculations based on a so-called routes utilisation coefficient, which allows the carrier to also take the possibility of the return rides without load into account Currently it is usually used as a constant from the interval from zero to one Purpose of the article: Considering a different offer of return transport from individual European Union (EU) countries, it can be assumed that the routes utilisation coefficient should have different values because there is a varying level of non-zero probability that the vehicle will return without a load This study therefore proposes a new approach to determining the value of this coefficient based on transport direction The study also aims to identify clusters of EU countries, for which the common value of the coefficient should be set Methods: The Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) test was used to verify the assumption of the differences among the means of transport offers Cluster analysis was used to identify the aforementioned groups of countries This analysis is based on real data on transport offers to Slovakia from 1 different EU countries Findings & value added: The results of the analysis can also be used in other EU countries because if significant differences in transport offers to Slovakia exist in individual countries, there is a reasonable assumption that this conclusion will also be valid in other countries The analysis demonstrated that it is more appropriate to use the routes utilisation coefficient with various values, dependent on the transport direction For the transport companies, implementation of the obtained results into practice is beneficial to increase their competitiveness through the more precise setting of transport prices, but also to the optimisation of the transport price itself with regard to the expected costs","Poliak, M.; Svabova, L.; Konecny, V.; Zhuravleva, N.

To develop specific anti-coronavirus therapeutics and prophylactics, the molecular mechanism that underlies viral infection must first be defined. Therefore, we herein established a SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein-mediated cell-cell fusion assay and found that SARS-CoV-2 showed a superior plasma membrane fusion capacity compared to that of SARS-CoV. We solved the X-ray crystal structure of six-helical bundle (6-HB) core of the HR1 and HR2 domains in the SARS-CoV-2 S protein S2 subunit, revealing that several mutated amino acid residues in the HR1 domain may be associated with enhanced interactions with the HR2 domain. We previously developed a pan-coronavirus fusion inhibitor, EK1, which targeted the HR1 domain and could inhibit infection by divergent human coronaviruses tested, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Here we generated a series of lipopeptides derived from EK1 and found that EK1C4 was the most potent fusion inhibitor against SARS-CoV-2 S protein-mediated membrane fusion and pseudovirus infection with IC50s of 1.3 and 15.8 nM, about 241- and 149-fold more potent than the original EK1 peptide, respectively. EK1C4 was also highly effective against membrane fusion and infection of other human coronavirus pseudoviruses tested, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as SARSr-CoVs, and potently inhibited the replication of 5 live human coronaviruses examined, including SARS-CoV-2. Intranasal application of EK1C4 before or after challenge with HCoV-OC43 protected mice from infection, suggesting that EK1C4 could be used for prevention and treatment of infection by the currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 and other emerging SARSr-CoVs.","Xia, Shuai; Liu, Meiqin; Wang, Chao; Xu, Wei; Lan, Qiaoshuai; Feng, Siliang; Qi, Feifei; Bao, Linlin; Du, Lanying; Liu, Shuwen; Qin, Chuan; Sun, Fei; Shi, Zhengli; Zhu, Yun; Jiang, Shibo; Lu, Lu",Cell Res,,472

The current COVID-19 pandemic has affected almost every part of life and economy. Consequently, this study sets off to assess the effect of the pandemic on blood supply and blood transfusion in the University of Calabar Teaching Hospital. METHODS: Data from the Donor Clinic and Blood Group Serology Unit of the University of Calabar Teaching Hospital were retrospectively extracted to evaluate supply and use of blood before and during COVID-19 pandemic. RESULT: A total of 1638 donors were recorded within the study period. Age range 15-29 and 30-44 years constituted majority of the subjects (58.9% and 33.4%, respectively). The donor pool were male-dominated. Commercial donors (61.7%) and family replacement donors (30.6%) constituted majority of the donor pool. Most of the donor pool were students (37.1%), public servants (22.8%) and artisans (18.6%). A concomitant decrease of 26.1% and 18.9% were recorded in blood donation and request during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: Blood supply was not significantly affected in our study center as both requests and donations decreased.

MATERIALS & METHODS: A total of 1553 licensed physicians (65% males; average age 44.0 years) responded to an online survey in September 2020. Differences in the respondents' general data and attitudes regarding workforce management and outbreak preparedness in Serbia were analysed in relation to their engagement during the COVID-19 pandemic (Pearson &#967;2 and the independent samples t-test, p < 0.05). The logistic regression model explained the need for changing health workforce management. RESULTS: The results reveal that the physicians engaged in the fight against the spread of COVID-19 (64.4% of the respondents) more often than their counterparts, were clinicians from the public sector, younger, with less work experience, influenced negatively by the pandemic, and reassigned to other positions (p < 0.001). Health workers dissatisfied with workplace preparedness and those reassigned due to COVID-19 were by 2.61 times and 1.38 times, respectively, more likely than their counterparts to consider changes in health workforce management.

Our study aimed to investigate the clinical features of patients on maintenance hemodialysis. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: In this retrospective, single-center study, we included 49 hospitalized patients on maintenance hemodialysis and 52 hospitalized patients without kidney failure (controls) with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 at Tongren Hospital of Wuhan University from January 30, 2020 to March 10, 2020. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and radiologic characteristics and treatment and outcomes data were analyzed. The final date of follow-up was March 19, 2020. RESULTS: The median age of 101 patients was 62 years (interquartile range, 49-72). All patients were local residents of Wuhan. In terms of common symptoms, there were differences between patients on hemodialysis and controls (fatigue [59% versus 83%], dry cough [49% versus 71%], and fever [47% versus 90%]). Lymphocyte counts were decreased (0.8×109/L [patients on hemodialysis] versus 0.9×109/L [controls], P=0.02). Comparing patients on hemodialysis with controls, creatine kinase-muscle and brain type, myoglobin, hypersensitive troponin I, B-type natriuretic peptide, and procalcitonin were increased, and the percentage of abnormalities in bilateral lung was higher in computed tomographic scan (82% versus 69%, P=0.15) and unilateral lung was lower (10% versus 27%, P=0.03). Common complications including shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome, arrhythmia, and acute cardiac injury in patients on hemodialysis were significantly higher. Compared with controls, more patients on hemodialysis received noninvasive ventilation (25% versus 6%, P=0.008). As of March 19, 2020, three patients on hemodialysis (6%) were transferred to the intensive care unit and received invasive ventilation. Seven patients on hemodialysis (14%) had died. CONCLUSIONS: The main symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia, including fever and cough, were less common in patients on hemodialysis. Patients on hemodialysis with coronavirus disease 2019 were at higher risk of death.","Wu, Jun; Li, Jushuang; Zhu, Geli; Zhang, Yanxia; Bi, Zhimin; Yu, Yean; Huang, Bo; Fu, Shouzhi; Tan, Yiqing; Sun, Jianbin; Li, Xiangyou",Clin J Am Soc Nephrol,,472

This study aimed to focus on the impact of relevant clinical and laboratory factors on the protective effect of glucocorticoids on mortality. METHODS: A sub-analysis was performed of the multicenter Cardio-COVID-Italy registry, enrolling consecutive patients with COVID-19 admitted to 13 Italian cardiology units between 01 March 2020 and 09 April 2020. The primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: A total of 706 COVID-19 patients were included (349 treated with glucocorticoids, 357 not treated with glucocorticoids). After adjustment for relevant covariates, use of glucocorticoids was associated with a lower risk of in-hospital mortality (adjusted HR 0.44; 95% CI 0.26-0.72; p = 0.001). A significant interaction was observed between the protective effect of glucocorticoids on mortality and PaO2/FiO2 ratio on admission (p = 0.042), oxygen saturation on admission (p = 0.017), and peak CRP (0.023). Such protective effects of glucocorticoids were mainly observed in patients with lower PaO2/FiO2 ratio (<300), lower oxygen saturation (<90%), and higher CRP (>100 mg/L).

Using an online survey, data were collected between late March and early April 2020. Participants were recruited through Amazon Mechanical Turk and included 747 adults living in the United States. Supporting our hypotheses, results indicated that both COVID-19-related worries and social isolation were significant mediators of the relationship between PVC and TS (Model 1). In addition, the results of a moderated mediation analysis indicated that the indirect effect of PVC on TS through COVID-19-related worries was stronger for participants who reported greater social isolation (Model 2). Although future research is needed, these findings suggest that both social isolation and disease-related worries may be important variables that can be targeted in interventions to reduce pandemic-related TS.","Boyraz, Güler; Legros, Dominique N; Tigershtrom, Ashley",J Anxiety Disord,,472

479820,"Arts-led revitalization, overtourism and community responses: Ihwa Mural Village, Seoul",2020,"Increasingly, human behavior can be monitored through the collection of data from digital devices revealing information on behaviors and locations. In the context of higher education, a growing number of schools and universities collect data on their students with the purpose of assessing or predicting behaviors and academic performance, and the COVID-19-induced move to online education dramatically increases what can be accumulated in this way, raising concerns about students' privacy. We focus on academic performance and ask whether predictive performance for a given dataset can be achieved with less privacy-invasive, but more task-specific, data. We draw on a unique dataset on a large student population containing both highly detailed measures of behavior and personality and high-quality third-party reported individual-level administrative data. We find that models estimated using the big behavioral data are indeed able to accurately predict academic performance out of sample. However, models using only low-dimensional and arguably less privacy-invasive administrative data perform considerably better and, importantly, do not improve when we add the high-resolution, privacy-invasive behavioral data. We argue that combining big behavioral data with ""ground truth"" administrative registry data can ideally allow the identification of privacy-preserving task-specific features that can be employed instead of current indiscriminate troves of behavioral data, with better privacy and better prediction resulting.","Bjerre-Nielsen, Andreas; Kassarnig, Valentin; Lassen, David Dreyer; Lehmann, Sune",Proc.

479903,Leveraging Undergraduate Learning Assistants to Engage Students during Remote Instruction: Strategies and Lessons Learned from Four Institutions,2020,"Biological macroscopic assemblies have inspired researchers to utilize molecular recognition to develop smart materials in these decades. Recently, macroscopic self-assemblies based on molecular recognition have been realized using millimeter-scale hydrogel pieces possessing molecular recognition moieties. During the study on macroscopic self-assembly based on molecular recognition, we noticed that the shape of assemblies might be dependent on the host-guest pair. In this study, we were thus motivated to study the macroscopic shape of assemblies formed through host-guest interaction. We modified crosslinked poly(sodium acrylate) microparticles, i.e., superabsorbent polymer (SAP) microparticles, with ß-cyclodextrin (ßCD) and adamantyl (Ad) residues (ßCD(x)-SAP and Ad(y)-SAP microparticles, respectively, where x and y denote the mol% contents of ßCD and Ad residues). Then, we studied the self-assembly behavior of ßCD(x)-SAP and Ad(y)-SAP microparticles through the complexation of ßCD with Ad residues. There was a threshold of the ßCD content in ßCD(x)-SAP microparticles for assembly formation between x = 22.3 and 26.7. On the other hand, the shape of assemblies was dependent on the Ad content, y; More elongated assemblies were formed at a higher y. This may be because, at a higher y, small clusters formed in an early stage can stick together even upon collisions at a single contact point to form elongated aggregates, whereas, at a smaller y, small clusters stick together only upon collisions at multiple contact points to give rather circular assemblies. On the basis of these observations, the shape of assembly formed from microparticles can be controlled by varying y.","Itami, Takahiro; Hashidzume, Akihito; Kamon, Yuri; Yamaguchi, Hiroyasu; Harada, Akira",Sci Rep,,472

Since that time, various feed additives have been evaluated at the laboratory level to measure their effect on viral viability and infectivity in contaminated feed using bioassay piglet models. While a valid first step, the conditions of these studies were not representative of commercial swine production. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the ability of feed additives to mitigate the risk of virus-contaminated feed using a model based on real-world conditions. This new model used an 'ice-block' challenge, containing equal concentrations of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), Senecavirus A (SVA) and PEDV, larger populations of pigs, representative commercial facilities and environments, along with realistic volumes of complete feed supplemented with selected additives. Following supplementation, the ice block was manually dropped into designated feed bins and pigs consumed feed by natural feeding behaviour. After challenge, samples were collected at the pen level (feed troughs, oral fluids) and at the animal level (clinical signs, viral infection, growth rate, and mortality) across five independent experiments involving 15 additives. In 14 of the additives tested, pigs on supplemented diets had significantly greater average daily gain (ADG), significantly lower clinical signs and infection levels, and numerically lower mortality rates compared to non-supplemented controls. In conclusion, the majority of the additives evaluated mitigated the effects of PRRSV 174, PEDV and SVA in contaminated feed, resulting in improved health and performance.","Dee, Scott A; Niederwerder, Megan C; Edler, Roy; Hanson, Dan; Singrey, Aaron; Cochrane, Roger; Spronk, Gordon; Nelson, Eric",,,472
480825,Empower Eco Multi-Actor HUB: a triple helix “academia-industry-authority” approach to creating and sharing potentially disruptive tools for addressing novel and emerging new Green Deal opportunities under a United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals framework,2021,"BACKGROUND: Severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is frequently associated with hyperinflammation and hyperferritinemia. The latter is related to increased mortality in COVID-19. Still, it is not clear if iron dysmetabolism is mechanistically linked to COVID-19 pathobiology. METHODS: We herein present data from the ongoing prospective, multicentre, observational CovILD cohort study (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT04416100), which systematically follows up patients after COVID-19. 109 participants were evaluated 60 days after onset of first COVID-19 symptoms including clinical examination, chest computed tomography and laboratory testing. RESULTS: We investigated subjects with mild to critical COVID-19, of which the majority received hospital treatment. 60 days after disease onset, 30% of subjects still presented with iron deficiency and 9% had anemia, mostly categorized as anemia of inflammation. Anemic patients had increased levels of inflammation markers such as interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein and survived a more severe course of COVID-19. Hyperferritinemia was still present in 38% of all individuals and was more frequent in subjects with preceding severe or critical COVID-19. Analysis of the mRNA expression of peripheral blood mononuclear cells demonstrated a correlation of increased ferritin and cytokine mRNA expression in these patients. Finally, persisting hyperferritinemia was significantly associated with severe lung pathologies in computed tomography scans and a decreased performance status as compared to patients without hyperferritinemia. DISCUSSION: Alterations of iron homeostasis can persist for at least two months after the onset of COVID-19 and are closely associated with non-resolving lung pathologies and impaired physical performance. Determination of serum iron parameters may thus be a easy to access measure to monitor the resolution of COVID-19.

COVID-19 is a pneumonia caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), previously known as the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Typical symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough and fatigue. As a novel disease, there are still many unsolved questions regarding COVID-19. Nevertheless, genetic analysis has demonstrated that the virus is strongly associated with certain SARS-like coronavirus originated from bats. The COVID-19 outbreak started in a seafood wholesale market in Wuhan, China, but the exact origin of the virus is still highly debatable. Since there is currently no registered antiviral drug for the disease, symptomatic treatments have been applied routinely to manage COVID-19 cases. However, various drugs and vaccines have been currently under research. This review aims to consolidate and discuss the likely origins and genetic features of SARS-CoV-2 as well as the recent clinical findings and potential effective treatments of COVID-19.

METHOD: University students at risk of developing an eating disorder (N = 100) were randomly assigned to either receiving an online intervention to reduce disordered eating or not. Forty-one participants entered the study from September 2019 to March 2020 (pre-COVID) and 59 after physical distancing was introduced due to COVID pandemic (during COVID). Online assessments were conducted at baseline and 1-week follow up. RESULTS: There was a significant increase in weight concerns, disordered eating, and negative affect among participants entering the trial during COVID compared to pre-COVID. The increases in the first two variables remained when adjusting for baseline negative affect. No significant interactions between time, condition and COVID status were observed. DISCUSSION: Young women experienced increased levels of disordered eating after the onset of COVID. While no interactions with COVID were detected, changes to within-group effect sizes for disordered eating more than doubled for both online interventions and assessment from pre-COVID to during COVID, suggesting any attention to issues related to disordered eating in the context of reduced social contact may be beneficial.","Zhou, Yuan; Wade, Tracey D",Int J Eat Disord,,472

This narrative review aims to determine current trends in literature regarding the relationship between EC and alcohol dual use, as well as hypothesize potential pathogenic tissue damage and summarize areas for future study, including second-hand vapor exposure and calling for standardization among studies. In summary, EC users are more likely to participate in hazardous drinking and are at higher risk for alcohol use disorder (AUD). We surmise the pathogenic damage of dual use may exhibit an additive effect, particularly in pathogen clearance from the lungs, increased inflammation and decreased immune response, physical damage to epithelial cells, and exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)-like illnesses. A better understanding of pathogenic damages is critical to understand the risks placed on dual users when exposed to respiratory pathogens, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).","Wetzel, Tanner J; Wyatt, Todd A",Front Physiol,,472

OBJECTIVE: To understand barriers to physical distancing among HCWs on an inpatient unit and identify strategies for improvement. DESIGN: Qualitative study including observations and semistructured interviews conducted over 3 months. SETTING: A non-COVID-19 adult general medical unit in an academic tertiary-care hospital. PARTICIPANTS: HCWs based on the unit. METHODS: We performed a qualitative study in which we (1) observed HCW activities and proximity to each other on the unit during weekday shifts July-October 2020 and (2) conducted semi-structured interviews of HCWs to understand their experiences with and perspectives of physical distancing in the hospital. Qualitative data were coded based on a human-factors engineering model. RESULTS: We completed 25 hours of observations and 20 HCW interviews. High-risk interactions often occurred during handoffs of care at shift changes and patient rounds, when HCWs gathered regularly in close proximity for at least 15 minutes. Identified barriers included spacing and availability of computers, the need to communicate confidential patient information, and the desire to maintain relationships at work. CONCLUSIONS: Physical distancing can be improved in hospitals by restructuring computer workstations, work rooms, and break rooms; applying visible cognitive aids; adapting shift times; and supporting rounds and meetings with virtual conferencing. Additional strategies to promote staff adherence to physical distancing include rewarding positive behaviors, having peer leaders model physical distancing, and encouraging additional safe avenues for social connection at a safe distance.","Keller, Sara C; Pau, Sara; Salinas, Alejandra B; Oladapo-Shittu, Opeyemi; Cosgrove, Sara E; Lewis-Cherry, Robin; Vecchio-Pagan, Briana; Osei, Patience; Gurses, Ayse P; Rock, Clare; Sick-Samuels, Anna C",Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,,472

OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the diagnostic performance of the Abbott ARCHITECT SARS-CoV-2 IgG test, a fully automated indirect immunoassay that detects antibodies directed to a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid antigen. STUDY DESIGN: Abbott ARCHITECT SARS-CoV-2 IgG immunoassay was compared to an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) on sera from patients with COVID-19 collected at different days after symptoms onset or infected by other human coronaviruses. Comparison with neutralization test was also performed. RESULTS: After 7, 14 and >14 days after onset ARCHITECT was positive on 8.3 %; 61.9 % and 100 % of the tested samples compared to 58.3 %; 85.7 % and 100 % by IFA. The sensitivity was 72 % vs. IFA and 66.7 % vs. a real-time PCR, the specificity was 100 %. On 18 samples with neutralizing activity, 17 were positive by Abbott ARCHITECT SARS-CoV-2 IgG. CONCLUSIONS: In our study, Abbott ARCHITECT SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay showed a satisfactory performance, with a very high specificity. IgG reactivity against SARSCoV-2 N antigen was detectable in all patients by two weeks after symptoms onset. In addition, concordance between this serological response and viral neutralization suggests that a strong humoral response may be predictive of a neutralization activity, regardless of the target antigens. This finding supports the use of this automated serological assay in diagnostic algorithm and public health intervention, especially for high loads of testing.","Meschi, Silvia; Colavita, Francesca; Bordi, Licia; Matusali, Giulia; Lapa, Daniele; Amendola, Alessandra; Vairo, Francesco; Ippolito, Giuseppe; Capobianchi, Maria Rosaria; Castilletti, Concetta",J Clin Virol,,472

This paper examines the applicability of the logistic growth model, with implications for the study of the COVID-19 pandemic and other infectious diseases. METHODS: An NLS (Non-Linear Least Squares) method was employed to estimate the parameters of a differentiated logistic growth function using new daily COVID-19 cases in multiple regions in China and in other selected countries. The estimation was based upon training data from January 20, 2020 to March 13, 2020. A restriction test was subsequently implemented to examine whether a designated parameter was identical among regions or countries, and the diagnosis of residuals was also conducted. The model's goodness of fit was checked using testing data from March 14, 2020 to April 18, 2020. RESULTS: The model presented in this paper fitted time-series data exceedingly well for the whole of China, its eleven selected provinces and municipalities, and two other countries - South Korea and Iran - and provided estimates of key parameters. This study rejected the null hypothesis that the growth rates of outbreaks were the same among ten selected non-Hubei provinces in China, as well as between South Korea and Iran. The study found that the model did not provide reliable estimates for countries that were in the early stages of outbreaks. Furthermore, this study concured that the R2 values might vary and mislead when compared between different portions of the same non-linear curve. In addition, the study identified the existence of heteroskedasticity and positive serial correlation within residuals in some provinces and countries. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that there is potential for this model to contribute to better public health policy in combatting COVID-19. The model does so by providing a simple logistic framework for retrospectively analyzing outbreaks in regions that have already experienced a maximal proliferation in cases. Based upon statistical findings, this study also outlines certain challenges in modelling and their implications for the results.","Shen, Christopher Y",Int J Infect Dis,,472

We aimed to evaluate the real-world effectiveness of add-on semi-individualized CM during the outbreak. A retrospective cohort of 1788 adult confirmed COVID-19 patients were recruited from 2235 consecutive linked records retrieved from five hospitals in Wuhan during 15 January to 13 March 2020. The mortality of add-on semi-individualized CM users and non-users was compared by inverse probability weighted hazard ratio (HR) and by propensity score matching. Change of biomarkers was compared between groups, and the frequency of CMs used was analyzed. Subgroup analysis was performed to stratify disease severity and dose of CM exposure. The crude mortality was 3.8% in the semi-individualized CM user group and 17.0% among the non-users. Add-on CM was associated with a mortality reduction of 58% (HR = 0.42, 95% CI: 0.23 to 0.77, [Formula: see text] = 0.005) among all COVID-19 cases and 66% (HR = 0.34, 95% CI: 0.15 to 0.76, [Formula: see text] = 0.009) among severe/critical COVID-19 cases demonstrating dose-dependent response, after inversely weighted with propensity score. The result was robust in various stratified, weighted, matched, adjusted and sensitivity analyses. Severe/critical patients that received add-on CM had a trend of stabilized D-dimer level after 3-7 days of admission when compared to baseline. Immunomodulating and anti-asthmatic CMs were most used. Add-on semi-individualized CM was associated with significantly reduced mortality, especially among severe/critical cases.

The Polish Case,2020,"Introduction: Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis is a well-known complication of acute respiratory distress syndrome, the most serious manifestation of COVID-19. Four recent studies have reported its incidence among ICU COVID-19 patients. However, they do not share the same case definition, and have provided conflicting results. In this paper we have aimed at reported the incidence of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis for COVID-19 patients in our ICU, and at comparing the different definitions in order to assess their respective relevance. Methods: Retrospective cohort study of critically ill patients with severe COVID-19 requiring ICU management between 1st March and 30th April 2020. Results: Our results showed significantly lower incidence of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (1.8%;1/53), compared to three out of four previous studies, and wide variation in the numbers of cases with regard to the different definitions. Conclusion: Large-scale studies are needed for a better definition and a more accurate estimation of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis coinfection during COVID-19.","Gouzien, Laura; Cocherie, Theophile; Eloy, Odile; Legriel, Stéphane; Bedos, Jean-Pierre; Simon, Christelle; Marque-Juillet, Stephanie; Ferré, Alexis; Bruneel, Fabrice",Infect Dis Now,,472

In addition to improve response rate, induction therapy should preserve an adequate stem-cell collection. In the present retrospective study, we analyzed stem-cell collection in 325 newly diagnosed myeloma patients who received either VTD or VRD induction before ASCT. Stem-cell mobilization consisted of intravenous cyclophosphamide plus G-CSF. Plerixafor was administered preemptively to rescue mobilization. In comparison with VTD, VRD induction was associated with a more frequent use of plerixafor (19.3% versus 5.4%, p = 0.004) and with an increased number of apheresis to reach adequate collection (>2 apheresis required in 42.3% versus 30.2%, p = 0.05). Moreover, more patients experienced collection failure in the VRD group (6% versus 1.8%, p = 0.004). The median number of CD34-positive cells (×106/kg) was lower in the VRD group: 8.5 versus 9.3 (p = 0.05) in the VTD group. The vast majority of patients underwent ASCT (93% versus 98%, in VRD and VTD group, respectively). These data highlight the need of optimal stem-cell collection strategy, especially in the context of tandem transplantation and incorporation of anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody into induction.","Laurent, Vanille; Fronteau, Clémentine; Antier, Chloé; Dupuis, Pascale; Tessoulin, Benoit; Gastinne, Thomas; Mahé, Béatrice; Blin, Nicolas; Dubruille, Viviane; Lok, Anne; Chevallier, Patrice; Guillaume, Thierry; Garnier, Alice; Peterlin, Pierre; Le Bourgeois, Amandine; Vantyghem, Sophie; Tiab, Mourad; Godmer, Pascal; Sadot, Sophie; Loirat, Marion; Trebouet, Adrien; Cormier, Nicolas; Le Gouill, Steven; Moreau, Philippe; Touzeau, Cyrille",Bone marrow transplant,,472
492404,Using Evaluative Data to Assess Virtual Learning Experiences for Students During COVID-19,2020,"Metformin was proposed to be a candidate for host-directed therapy for COVID-19. However, its efficacy remains to be validated. In this study, we compared the outcome of metformin users and nonusers in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with diabetes. Hospitalized diabetic patients with confirmed COVID-19 in the Tongji Hospital of Wuhan, China, from January 27, 2020 to March 24, 2020, were grouped into metformin and no-metformin groups according to the diabetic medications used. The demographics, characteristics, laboratory parameters, treatments, and clinical outcome in these patients were retrospectively assessed. A total of 283 patients (104 in the metformin and 179 in the no-metformin group) were included in this study. There were no significant differences between the two groups in gender, age, underlying diseases, clinical severity, and oxygen-support category at admission. The fasting blood glucose level of the metformin group was higher than that of the no-metformin group at admission and was under effective control in both groups after admission. Other laboratory parameters at admission and treatments after admission were not different between the two groups. The length of hospital stay did not differ between the two groups (21.0 days for metformin versus 19.5 days for no metformin, P = 0.74). However, in-hospital mortality was significantly lower in the metformin group (3/104 (2.9%) versus 22/179 (12.3%), P = 0.01). Antidiabetic treatment with metformin was associated with decreased mortality compared with diabetics not receiving metformin. This retrospective analysis suggests that metformin may offer benefits in patients with COVID-19 and that further study is indicated.","Luo, Pan; Qiu, Lin; Liu, Yi; Liu, Xiu-Lan; Zheng, Jian-Ling; Xue, Hui-Ying; Liu, Wen-Hua; Liu, Dong; Li, Juan",Am. j. trop. med. hyg,,472

The bulk of attention is given to fraud victimization, with consideration also given to parent abuse, partner violence, and patient abuse. A review of data from the Federal Trade Commission shows that reports of most types of fraud grew significantly in the first three months of 2020 in comparison to the same time period in 2019. Differences between fraud experiences based on age are considered. Older persons lost much more to fraud than younger persons, and far more in 2020 than 2019. In addition, they reported being targeted more often for certain types of cybercrime (i.e., tech support scams). While devastating to everyone, it is concluded that the coronavirus will potentially have a more significant impact on the financial health of older persons than younger persons. It is concluded that minimizing the consequences of all forms of crimes targeting older adults will be best achieved by using a public health approach.","Payne, Brian K",Am J Crim Justice,,472

493830,Exploring the Knowledge Management Impact on Business Education,2021,"Changes to the United States kidney allocation system targeted at reducing organ discard have failed to improve organ utilization. High Kidney Donor Profile Index kidneys continue to be discarded at high rates as a result of the regulatory and financial barriers to widespread utilization of these organs. However, there are potential changes to clinical practice that could improve organ utilization. Expediting the time from initial offer to final organ acceptance would reduce cold ischemic time and should improve utilization. Implementation of procurement biopsy standards to avoid biopsy of low risk organs may prevent organ discards due to inaccurate data or excessive cold ischemia time. Further, standardization of procurement biopsy pathological interpretation coupled with electronic accessibility would enable early acceptance of difficult to transplant organs. These changes to allocation practice patterns are vital given proposals to expand the geographic sharing of deceased donor kidneys. Implementation of new allocation policies must be evaluated to ensure they result in higher transplant rates and acceptable post-transplant outcomes.","Stewart, Zoe A; Shah, Shimul A; Formica, Richard N; Kandaswamy, Raja; Paramesh, Anil S; Friedman, Jessica; Squires, Ronald; Cooper, Matthew; Axelrod, David A",Clin Transplant,,472
494757,The Supply Chain of the Mining Industry: The Case of Copper Mining,2021,"Patients with serious COVID infections develop shock frequently. To characterize the hemodynamic profile of this cohort, 156 patients with COVID pneumonia and shock requiring vasopressors had interpretable echocardiography with measurement of ejection fraction (EF) by Simpson's rule and stroke volume (SV) by Doppler. RV systolic pressure (RVSP) was estimated from the tricuspid regurgitation peak velocity. Patients were divided into groups with low or preserved EF (EFL or EFP, cutoff &#8804;45%), and low or normal cardiac index (CIL or CIN, cutoff &#8804;2.2 L/min/m2). Mean age was 67 ± 12.0, EF 59.5 ± 12.9, and CI 2.40 ± 0.86. A minority of patients had depressed EF (EFLCIL, n = 15, EFLCIN, n = 8); of those with preserved EF, less than half had low CI (EFPCIL, n = 55, EFPCIN, n = 73). Overall hospital mortality was 73%. Mortality was highest in the EFLCIL group (87%), but the difference between groups was not significant (p = 0.68 by ANOVA). High PEEP correlated with low CI in the EFPCIL group (r = 0.44, p = 0.04). In conclusion, this study reports the prevalence of shock characterized by EF and CI in patients with COVID-19. COVID-induced shock had a cardiogenic profile (EFLCIL) in 9.6% of patients, reflecting the impact of COVID-19 on myocardial function. Low CI despite preservation of EF and the correlation with PEEP suggests underfilling of the LV in this subset; these patients might benefit from additional volume.

This study adapted Respondent Driven Sampling, a peer-driven recruitment method, to a digital platform (d-RDS) and evaluated its utility to recruit community-dwelling emerging adult (EA) risky drinkers, who are under-served and more difficult to reach for assessment and intervention than their college student peers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Community-dwelling EA risky drinkers (N = 357) were recruited using d-RDS (M age = 23.6 years, 64.0% women). Peers recruited peers in an iterative fashion. Participants completed a web-based cross-sectional survey of drinking practices and problems and associated risk and protective factors. RESULTS: d-RDS successfully recruited EA risky drinkers. On average, the sample reported recent drinking exceeding low-risk drinking guidelines and 8.80 negative consequences in the past three months. Compared to age-matched respondents from the representative U.S. National Survey on Drug Use and Health, the sample reported more past month drinking days and more drinks consumed per drinking day (ps < 0.001). At higher consumption levels, predicted positive associations were found with lower education and receipt of public assistance. CONCLUSIONS: Results supported the utility of d-RDS as a sampling method and grassroots platform for research and intervention with community-dwelling EA drinkers who are harder to reach than traditional college students. The study provides a method and lays an empirical foundation for extending efficacious alcohol brief interventions with college drinkers to this underserved population.","Tucker, Jalie A; Bacon, Joseph P; Chandler, Susan D; Lindstrom, Katie; Cheong, JeeWon",Addict Behav,,472

However, the CD4+ T cell population critical for antibody response in COVID-19 is poorly understood.METHODSIn this study, we provided a comprehensive analysis of peripheral CD4+ T cells from 13 COVID-19 convalescent patients, defined as confirmed free of SARS-CoV-2 for 2 to 4 weeks, using flow cytometry and magnetic chemiluminescence enzyme antibody immunoassay. The data were correlated with clinical characteristics.RESULTSWe observed that, relative to healthy individuals, convalescent patients displayed an altered peripheral CD4+ T cell spectrum. Specifically, consistent with other viral infections, cTfh1 cells associated with SARS-CoV-2-targeting antibodies were found in COVID-19 covalescent patients. Individuals with severe disease showed higher frequencies of Tem and Tfh-em cells but lower frequencies of Tcm, Tfh-cm, Tfr, and Tnaive cells, compared with healthy individuals and patients with mild and moderate disease. Interestingly, a higher frequency of cTfh-em cells correlated with a lower blood oxygen level, recorded at the time of admission, in convalescent patients. These observations might constitute residual effects by which COVID-19 can impact the homeostasis of CD4+ T cells in the long-term and explain the highest ratio of class-switched virus-specific antibody producing individuals found in our severe COVID-19 cohort.CONCLUSIONOur study demonstrated a close connection between CD4+ T cells and antibody production in COVID-19 convalescent patients.FUNDINGSix Talent Peaks Project in Jiangsu Province and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC).","Gong, Fang; Dai, Yaping; Zheng, Ting; Cheng, Liang; Zhao, Dan; Wang, Hao; Liu, Min; Pei, Hao; Jin, Tengchuan; Yu, Di; Zhou, Pengcheng",J. clin. invest,,472

The Harm Reduction and BRidges to Care (HRBR) Clinic is an on demand, low barrier addiction clinic that opened in October 2019. In the first three months of operation (November through January 2020), HRBR saw steadily increasing numbers of patients. Oregon saw its first case of novel coronavirus in February, and declared a state of emergency and enacted a formal ""Stay at Home"" order in March. That same month, the DEA announced that patients could be initiated on buprenorphine through telemedicine visits without an in-person exam. Within a week of being granted the ability to see patients virtually, HRBR had transitioned to over 90% virtual visits, while still allowing patients without technology to access in-person care. Within four weeks, the clinic expanded hours significantly, established workflows with community harm reduction partners, and was caring for patients in rural areas of the state. In response to the COVID-19 crisis, the HRBR clinic was able to quickly transition from in-person to almost completely virtual visits within a week. This rapid pivot to telemedicine significantly increased access to care for individuals seeking low-threshold treatment in multiple contexts. Overarching institutional support, grant funding and a small flexible team were critical. HRBR's increased access and capacity were only possible with the Drug Enforcement Agency loosening restrictions around the use of telehealth for new patients. Keeping these altered regulations in place will be key to improving health and health care equity for people who use drugs, even after the pandemic subsides. Further research is needed in to whether addiction telemedicine impacts medication diversion rates, continued substance use, or provider practices.","Buchheit, Bradley M; Wheelock, Haven; Lee, Abby; Brandt, Kimberly; Gregg, Jessica",J Subst Abuse Treat,,472

We therefore, designed a study to report the demand for TTE in two large District General Hospitals during the rise in the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in the UK. A primary clinical outcome of 30-day mortality was also assessed. METHODS: The TTE service across two hospitals was reconfigured to maximise access to inpatient scanning. All TTEs of suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 patients over a 3-week period were included in the study. All patients were followed up until at least day 30 after their scan at which point the primary clinical outcome of mortality was recorded. Comparative analysis based on mortality was conducted for all TTE results, biochemical markers and demographics. RESULTS: 27 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 had a TTE within the inclusion window. Mortality comparative analysis showed the deceased group were significantly older (mean 68.4, SD 11.9 vs 60.5, SD 13.0, p=0.03) and more commonly reported fatigue in their presenting symptoms (29.6% vs 71.4%, p=0.01). No other differences were identified in the demographic or biochemical data. Left ventricular systolic dysfunction was noted in 7.4% of patients and right ventricular impairment or dilation was seen in 18.5% patients. TTE results were not significantly different in mortality comparative analysis. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates an achievable approach to TTE services when under increased pressure. Data analysis supports the limited available data suggesting right ventricular abnormalities are the most commonly identified echocardiographic change in SARS-CoV-2 patients. No association can be demonstrated between mortality and TTE results.","Crook, Rebecca Lucy; Williams, Howell; Green, Mary; Brown, Stewart; Morris, Richard; Fletcher, Hannah; Walters, Sarah; Walsh, Catherine; Price, Anna; King, Samantha; McAloon, Christopher James",,,472

499363,Has air quality improved in Ecuador during the COVID-19 pandemic? A parametric analysis,2020,"BACKGROUND: Vascular spasm is well known to occur in the arterial system. Central venous spasm during pacemaker implantation is uncommon with only a few cases reported from time to time. Sometimes, the venous spasms may not respond to nitroglycerine injections which requires a change of access site and undue discomfort for the patient. CASE PRESENTATION: A 72-year-old female patient with no prior comorbidities presented to us with recurrent dizziness on exertion and at rest. The electrocardiogram showed complete heart block, likely to be of sclerodegenerative etiology as the patient did not have any ischemic symptoms, also the electrocardiogram and echocardiogram did not show any evidence of ischemia. As part of the hospital protocol, a venogram was performed by giving intravenous diluted contrast (iohexol) through the left brachial vein, which showed good-sized axillary and subclavian veins. We attempted to cannulate the left axillary vein with a 16G needle using Seldinger technique, but the axillary vein could not be cannulated despite multiple attempts. We gave incremental boluses of intravenous nitroglycerine, despite that the left axillary vein could not be cannulated. Repeat intravenous contrast injection showed severe spasm of axillary and subclavian veins. Finally, the axillary vein was cannulated from the right side using anatomical landmarks and a pacemaker was implanted.

500572,Window operation behaviour and indoor air quality during lockdown: A monitoring-based simulation-assisted study in London,2021,"Over the past decade, nighttime lights have become a widely used proxy for measuring economic activity. This paper examines the potential for high frequency nighttime lights data to provide “near real-time” tracking of the economic impacts of the COVID-19 crisis in Morocco. At the national level, there exists a statistically significant correlation between quarterly movements in Morocco's overall nighttime light intensity and movements in its real GDP. This finding supports the cautious use of lights data to track the economic impacts of the COVID-19 crisis at higher temporal frequencies and at the subnational and city levels, for which GDP data are unavailable. Relative to its pre-COVID-19 trend growth path of lights, Morocco experienced a large drop in the overall intensity of its lights in March 2020 following the country's first COVID-19 case and the introduction of strict lockdown measures, from which it has subsequently struggled to recover. At the subnational and city levels, while all regions and cities examined shared in March's national decline in nighttime light intensity, some suffered much larger declines than others. Since then, the relative effects of the COVID-19 shock across regions and cities appear to have largely persisted. Notwithstanding these findings, however, further research is required to ascertain the exact causes of the observed changes in light intensity and to fully verify that the results are driven by anthropogenic causes.","Roberts, Mark",Development Engineering,,472

Characterizing the viral concentration and modelling the viral transmission are, therefore, considered major milestones for enhancing viral detection capabilities. This paper addresses the problem of viral aerosol detection from the exhaled breath in a bounded environment, e.g., a bounded room. The paper models the exhaled breath as a cloud which is emitted through the room, and analyzes the temporal-spatial virus-laden aerosol concentration by accounting for partial absorption and reflection at each side of the room. The paper first derives a closed form expression of the temporal-spatial virus-laden aerosol concentration. It then considers the deployment of a receiver composed of an air sampler and a bio-sensor to detect the viral existence of a specific virus. We, therefore, assess the detection capabilities of the proposed system via evaluating the viral miss-detection probability as a function of the sampling volume and the detection time-instance at the receiver side. Our numerical simulations verify the validity of the analytical results, and illustrate the ability of the proposed system to detect viruses in indoor environments. The results further characterize the impacts of several system parameters on the miss-detection probability. IEEE","Amin, O.; Dahrouj, H.; Almayouf, N.; Al-Naffouri, T.

503588,Research Roundup,2021,"Introduction: no one can deny that vaccination against several serious diseases in the world, and particularly in Morocco, has given very satisfactory protective results. The extension of the COVID-19 pandemic in our country has led to a significant decline in childhood immunization, which could have severe repercussions increasing the risk of future outbreaks. Hence, the measures of the Ministry of Health to correct the situation. The purpose of this study was to highlight the extent of vaccine release during COVID-19 pandemic and to make recommendations to restore vaccination programmes. Methods: we conducted a cross-sectional study of the effect of containment measures during this pandemic on the monitoring of children´s vaccinations. We conducted a national survey of pediatricians using an electronic questionnaire administered via Google Forms. We collected, analyzed and interpreted the results. Results: one hundred and three Moroccan pediatricians answered the questionnaire. More than 2-thirds (78.6%) of pediatricians practiced in the private sector and delivered vaccines in the immunization schedule. The majority of pediatricians (95%) were asked about parental vaccine concerns. We noted that 82.5% of parents were reluctant to go to the local health department and 5.8% refused to take vaccination during COVID-19 pandemic. About 22% of pediatricians completely stopped immunization services and 72.8% delayed immunizations from 3 to 4 weeks. Vaccination stoppage involved older children in two thirds of cases. Conclusion: it is essential to maintain public confidence in vaccination. Ongoing and timely assessment of vaccine coverage as well as clear recommendations and broad public awareness are essential to respond to vaccine changes during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Chekhlabi, Nabila; Arrab, Raja; Ettair, Said; Dini, Nouzha",Pan Afr Med J,,472
503732,Airport landside sustainable capacity and level of service of terminal functional subsystems,2020,"The objectives of the present longitudinal study were to (i) understand the potential impacts of concern about the COVID-19 epidemic and containment measures (e.g. lockdown) on the psychological and emotional status of women during pregnancy and after childbirth, (ii) identify factors associated with these impacts, and (iii) to study the mothers’ coping strategies and protective factors. Data were collected during pregnancy (timepoint 1, during France's first period of lockdown from April 6th to May 11th, 2020) and then one month after childbirth (timepoint 2). At timepoint 1, 90 women completed a sociodemographic questionnaire, the Spielberger Trait Anxiety Inventory, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, and the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support. At timepoint 2, 26 women completed the City Birth Trauma Scale, the Interpersonal Emotional Regulation Questionnaire, and the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory. The relationship between social support and worry about the fetus/baby during the COVID-19 pandemic was statistically significant (Rho=- 0.21;p&lt;0.05). Worry about the fetus/baby was also significantly correlated with the anxiety score (Rho=0.60;p&lt;0.01) and the depression score (Rho= 0.37, p&lt;0.01). When the study population was compared with a control sample of new mothers having given birth outside the lockdown period, we observed differences in the prevalence of anxiety but not in the prevalence of postpartum PTSD. Lastly, the relationship between posttraumatic growth and emotion regulation was not significant (Rho=0.29, p=0.16 for soothing;Rho=0.26, p=0.20 for social modeling;Rho=0.28;p=0.17 for perspective-taking;Rho=0.35;p=0.08 for enhancing positive affect). In view of the sample size and the statistical tests, this study should be considered as exploratory. Our present results open up opportunities for further research and suggest that a possible impact of COVID-19 must be considered when evaluating potential psychological disorders in the perinatal period.","V, Gonzalez-Garcia M Exertier A Denis",European Journal of Trauma &amp; Dissociation,,472

504357,Emergency Remote Library Instruction and Tech Tools,2021,"In the fight against Covid-19, many governments and businesses are in the process of evaluating, trialling and even implementing so-called immunity passports. Also known as antibody or health certificates, there is a clear demand for any technology that could allow people to return to work and other crowded places without placing others at risk. One of the major criticisms of such systems is that they could be misused to unfairly discriminate against those without immunity, allowing the formation of an `immuno-privileged' class of people. In this work we are motivated to explore an alternative technical solution that is non-discriminatory by design. In particular we propose health tokens -- randomised health certificates which, using methods from differential privacy, allow individual test results to be randomised whilst still allowing useful aggregate risk estimates to be calculated. We show that health tokens could mitigate immunity-based discrimination whilst still presenting a viable mechanism for estimating the collective transmission risk posed by small groups of users. We evaluate the viability of our approach in the context of identity-free and identity-binding use cases and then consider a number of possible attacks. Our experimental results show that for groups of size 500 or more, the error associated with our method can be as low as 0.03 on average and thus the aggregated results can be useful in a number of identity-free contexts. Finally, we present the results of our open-source prototype which demonstrates the practicality of our solution.","Butler, David; Hicks, Chris; Bell, James; Maple, Carsten; Crowcroft, Jon",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.14329v2.pdf,472

One hundred and twenty chicks were divided into blank group, model group (IBV infection), positive drug group (IBV infection & Gan Dan oral liquid), and BQJGHJ high, middle and low dose groups (IBV infection & BQJGHJ), 20 chicks in each group. Except for the blank group, the other groups were modeled by infecting IBV-M41 strain, 4 days after modeling, the medicines were administrated through drinking water for 5 days. The clinical symptoms of each group were observed every day, the scores of clinical symptoms were recorded, the effective rate was counted, and the cure rate was used as the evaluation index. On the 3rd, 5th and 7th day post the first administration, the blood samples were collected from the wing vein and the serum were separated. The contents of IFN-γ, IL-6 and IL-10 in chicks serum were detected by ELISA. The results indicated that the cure rates of BQJGHJ high, middle and low dose groups were 75.0%, 80.0% and 65.0%, and the effective rates were 90.0%, 95.0% and 80.0%, respectively. The content of IL-10 in serum of chicks in model group decreased and the content of IL-6 increased, which was significantly different from that in blank group (P&lt;0.05 or P&lt;0.01). On day 3 and 5 of administration, the contents of IFN-γ (P&lt;0.01 at day 5 in high dose group, P&gt;0.05 for others) and IL-10(P&lt;0.01 at day 5 in eath BQJGHJ gruop and positive drug group) in serum of chicks in BQJGHJ high, middle and low dose groups and positive drug groups increased, while the contents of IL-6 in serum of chicks decreased, which were significantly different from those in model group (P&lt;0.05). On the 2nd day after withdrawal, the contents of IFN-γ and IL-10 in serum of chicks in BQJGHJ high, middle and low dose groups and positive drug groups increased, while the contents of IL-6 in serum decreased, which were significantly different from those in model group (P&lt;0.05 or P&lt;0.01); There was no significant difference in the contents of IFN-γ and IL-6, IL-10 in serum of chicks between each BQJGHJ group and the positive drug group (P&gt;0.05). BQJGHJ can increase the content of IFN-γ, IL-10 in serum of chicks with infectious bronchitis, reduce the content of IL-6 in serum of chicks with infectious bronchitis, so as to achieve the effect of treating infectious bronchitis in chicks.","Lin, Chunfa; Luo, Yichen; Wang, Zhongqing; Feng, Jingbo; Liu, Juan",Acta Veterinaria Zootechnica Sinica,,472

504786,Cyberattacks: a look at evidentiary thresholds in International Law,2020,"AIM: To describe diabetes nurses' perspectives on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on people with diabetes and diabetes services across Europe. METHODS: An online survey developed using a rapid Delphi method. The survey was translated into 17 different languages and disseminated electronically in 27 countries via national diabetes nurse networks. RESULTS: Survey responses from 1829 diabetes nurses were included in the analysis. The responses indicated that 28% (n = 504) and 48% (n = 873) of diabetes nurses felt the COVID-19 pandemic had impacted 'a lot' on the physical and psychological risks of people with diabetes, respectively. The following clinical problems were identified as having increased 'a lot': anxiety 82% (n = 1486); diabetes distress 65% (n = 1189); depression 49% (n = 893); acute hyperglycaemia 39% (n = 710) and foot complications 18% (n = 323). Forty-seven percent (n = 771) of respondents identified that the level of care provided to people with diabetes had declined either extremely or quite severely. Self-management support, diabetes education and psychological support were rated by diabetes nurse respondents as having declined extremely or quite severely during the COVID-19 pandemic by 31% (n = 499), 63% (n = 1,027) and 34% (n = 551), respectively. CONCLUSION: The findings show that diabetes nurses across Europe have seen significant increases in both physical and psychological problems in their patient populations during COVID-19. The data also show that clinical diabetes services have been significantly disrupted. As the COVID-19 situation continues, we need to adapt care systems with some urgency to minimise the impact of the pandemic on the diabetes population.","Forde, Rita; Arente, Liga; Ausili, Davide; De Backer, Kristin; Due-Christensen, Mette; Epps, Amanda; Fitzpatrick, Anne; Grixti, Moira; Groen, Sijda; Halkoaho, Arja; Huber, Claudia; Iversen, Marjolein M; Johansson, Unn-Britt; Leippert, Claudia; Ozcan, Seyda; Parker, Julie; Paiva, Ana Christina; Sanpetreanu, Adina; Savet, Marie-Alice; Rosana, Svetic-Cisic; Szewczyk, Alicja; Valverde, Maite; Vlachou, Eugenia; Forbes, Angus",Diabet Med,,472

Deafblind International organized a webinar to provide a platform where participants could exchange experiences and solutions to overcome the challenges created by the arrival of COVID-19, in order to facilitate information exchange among stakeholders in deafblindness during this pandemic. We present an overview of its content here and place the summarized themes in context with existing research literature. Abstract submission was open for 4?weeks in May 2020, resulting in 30 submissions from 13 countries across 5 continents.

509000,The Nursing Professional Development Practitioner During a Pandemic: Achieving the Hat Trick,2021,"BACKGROUND: Studies report hypercoagulability in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), leading many institutions to escalate anticoagulation intensity for thrombosis prophylaxis. OBJECTIVE: To determine the bleeding risk with various intensities of anticoagulation in critically ill patients with COVID-19 compared with other respiratory viral illnesses (ORVI). PATIENTS/METHODS: This retrospective cohort study compared the incidence of major bleeding in patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) within a single health system with COVID-19 versus ORVI. In the COVID-19 cohort, we assessed the effect of anticoagulation intensity received on ICU admission on bleeding risk. We performed a secondary analysis with anticoagulation intensity as a time-varying covariate to reflect dose changes after ICU admission. RESULTS: Four hundred and forty-three and 387 patients were included in the COVID-19 and ORVI cohorts, respectively. The hazard ratio of major bleeding for the COVID-19 cohort relative to the ORVI cohort was 1.26 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.86-1.86). In COVID-19 patients, an inverse-probability treatment weighted model found therapeutic-intensity anticoagulation on ICU admission had an adjusted hazard ratio of bleeding of 1.55 (95% CI: 0.88-2.73) compared with standard prophylactic-intensity anticoagulation. However, when anticoagulation was assessed as a time-varying covariate and adjusted for other risk factors for bleeding, the adjusted hazard ratio for bleeding on therapeutic-intensity anticoagulation compared with standard thromboprophylaxis was 2.59 (95% CI: 1.20-5.57). CONCLUSIONS: Critically ill patients with COVID-19 had a similar bleeding risk as ORVI patients. When accounting for changes in anticoagulation that occurred in COVID-19 patients, therapeutic-intensity anticoagulation was associated with a greater risk of major bleeding compared with standard thromboprophylaxis.","Halaby, Rim; Cuker, Adam; Yui, Jennifer; Matthews, Andrew; Ishaaya, Ella; Traxler, Elizabeth; Domenico, Christopher; Cooper, Tara; Tierney, Ann; Niami, Pardis; van der Rijst, Nathalie; Adusumalli, Srinath; Gutsche, Jacob; Giri, Jay; Pugliese, Steven; Hecht, Todd E H; Pishko, Allyson M",J Thromb Haemost,,472
509239,Lessons from the unexpected adoption of online teaching for an undergraduate genetics course with lab classes,2020,"BACKGROUND: In hemodialysis (HD) patients, central venous catheter (CVC) related bloodstream infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Hygienic precautions are a key aspect of dialysis care for infection prevention, but they are not sufficient to completely avoid the occurrence of CVC related infections. During the COVID-19 pandemic, hygienic precautions for preventing viral transmission have been markedly reinforced. We evaluated their effects on CVC-related infection rates. METHODS: An observational retrospective study was conducted in two hemodialysis units of the same institution treating 215 chronic hemodialysis patients, 71 of whom are currently (33%) using a CVC. In the CVC cohort, we compared data on catheter-related infection rates during the maximum spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy (February to May 2020) with data from the same period of the previous year and with the whole of 2019. RESULTS: In 2019, we recorded a catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) rate of 1.19 (95% CI 0.81-1.68)/1000 days [2.07 (95% CI 1.12-3.52)/1000 days in the Feb-May 2019 period] and a tunnel and exit-site infection rate of 0.82 (95% CI 0.51-1.24)/1000 days [1.04 (95% CI 0.41-2.15)/1000 days in the Feb-May 2019 period]. Infection rates drastically decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic, with just one catheter-related bloodstream infection being recorded. Catheter-related bloodstream infection rates showed a significant reduction to 0.20 (95% CI 0.01-0.9)/1000 days (p < 0.05 and p < 0.005 compared to 2019 and to Feb-May 2019, respectively) and a non-significant reduction in tunnel and exit-site infections to 0.6 (95% CI 0.15-1.6)/1000 days. CONCLUSIONS: The observed 91% reduction in catheter-related bloodstream infections compared to the same period in 2019 [IRR 0.09 (95% CI 0.002-0.64)] and the 83% reduction compared to the whole of 2019 [IRR 0.17 (95% CI 0.004-1.009)] suggest that a stricter implementation of hygienic precautions in the dialysis setting can markedly improve the problem of CVC-related infections.","Heidempergher, Marco; Sabiu, Gianmarco; Orani, Maria Antonietta; Tripepi, Giovanni; Gallieni, Maurizio",J. nephrol,,472
509677,Sanitary Crises and “No Contact” Aquaculture: Chilean Fish Farming During the Pandemic,2021,"The outbreak of COVID-19 from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread all over the world with tremendous morbidity and mortality in the elderly. In-hospital treatment addresses the multifaceted nature of the illness including initial viral replication, cytokine storm, and endothelial injury with thrombosis. We identified nine reports of early treatment outcomes in COVID-19 nursing home patients. Multi-drug therapy including hydroxychloroquine with one or more anti-infectives, corticosteroids, and antithrombotic anti-blood clotting agents can be extended to seniors in the nursing home setting without hospitalization. Data from nine studies found hydroxychloroquine-based multidrug regimens were associated with a statistically significant > 60% reduction in mortality. Going forward, we conclude that early empiric treatment for the elderly with COVID-19 in the nursing home setting (or similar congregated settings with elderly residents/patients e.g. LTF or ALF) has a reasonable probability of success and acceptable safety. This group remains our highest at-risk group and warrants acute treatment focus prior to symptoms worsening. Given the rapidity and severity of SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in nursing homes, in-center treatment of acute COVID-19 patients is a reasonable strategy to reduce the risks of hospitalization and death. If elderly high-risk patients in such congregated nursing home type settings are allowed to worsen with no early treatment, they may be too sick and fragile to benefit from in-hospital therapeutics and are at risk for pulmonary failure, life-ending micro-thrombi of the lungs, kidneys etc. The issue is timing of therapeutics, and we argue that early treatment before hospitalization, is the right time and can potentially save lives, especially among our higher-risk elderly populations hit hardest by severe illness and death from COVID-19. We must reiterate, we are talking about 'early' treatment before the disease is far along in the disease sequelae where the patient then needs hospitalization and aggressive interventions. We are referring to the initial days e.g. day one, post infection when symptoms emerge or there is strong clinical suspicion. This early therapeutic option deserves serious and urgent consideration by the medical establishment and respective decision-makers. Doctors must be allowed their clinical discretion in how they optimally treat their patients. Doctors must be brave and trust their skilled judgements and do all to save the lives of their patients. We therefore hypothesize that early outpatient ambulatory treatment, once initiated as soon as symptoms begin in high-risk positive persons, would significantly reduce hospitalizations and prevent deaths. Specifically, the provision of early multi-drug sequenced therapy with repurposed drugs will reduce hospitalization and death in elderly patients being cared for in long-term-care facilities. The most important implications of our hypothesis are: 1) hospitalizations and deaths would be reduced 2) transmission would be reduced due to the mitigation of symptoms and 3) recovery following infection and treatment provides for natural exposure immunity that is broad based, durable, and robust (helping towards natural immunity within the population). The end result is reduced strain on hospitals and systems that would allow for other non-COVID illnesses to receive care.","Alexander, Paul E; Armstrong, Robin; Fareed, George; Lotus, John; Oskoui, Ramin; Prodromos, Chad; Risch, Harvey A; Tenenbaum, Howard C; Wax, Craig M; Dara, Parvez; McCullough, Peter A; Gill, Kulvinder K",Med Hypotheses,,472
509678,Sanitary Crises and “No Contact” Aquaculture: Chilean Fish Farming During the Pandemic,2021,"Hospitals and ambulatory facilities significantly reduced cardiac care delivery in response to the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. The deferral of elective cardiovascular procedures led to a marked reduction in healthcare delivery with a significant impact on optimal cardiovascular care. International and Canadian data have reported dramatically increased wait-times for diagnostic tests and cardiovascular procedures, as well as associated increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. In the wake of the demonstrated ability to rapidly create critical care and hospital ward capacity, we advocate a different approach during the second and possible subsequent COVID-19 pandemic waves. We suggest an approach, informed by local data and experience, which balances the need for an expected rise in demand for healthcare resources to ensure appropriate COVID-19 surge capacity, with continued delivery of essential cardiovascular care. Incorporating cardiovascular care leaders into pandemic planning and operations will help healthcare systems minimize cardiac care delivery disruptions, while maintaining critical care and hospital ward surge capacity and continuing measures to reduce transmission risk in healthcare settings. Specific recommendations targeting the main pillars of cardiovascular care are presented: ambulatory, inpatient, procedural, diagnostic, surgical and rehabilitation.","Arora, Rakesh; Graham, Michelle; Singh, Gurmeet; Bewick, David; Clarke, Brian; Cowan, Simone; Gin, Kenneth; Virani, Sean; Wood, David; Krahn, Andrew; Ducharme, Anique; Gupta, Anil; Hardiman, Sean; Hartleib, Michael; Jackson, Simon; Jassal, Davinder; Kazmi, Mustapha; Lamarche, Yoan; Légaré, Jean-François; Chow, Chi-Ming; Leong-Poi, Howard; Mansour, Samer; Marelli, Ariane; Roifman, Idan; Wijeysundera, Harindra; Ruel, Marc; Small, Gary; Sterns, Larry; Turgeon, Ricky; Wong, Kenny; Zieroth, Shelley",Can. j. cardiol,,472

We aimed to examine prolonged length of in-hospital stay (LOS) due to Covid-19 among patients with lymphoma and assess its determinants and outcomes. Adult patients with lymphoma admitted for Covid-19 to 16 French hospitals in March and April, 2020 were included. Length of in-hospital stay was analyzed as a competitor vs death. The study included 111 patients. The median age was 65 years (range, 19-92). Ninety-four patients (85%) had B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Within the 12 months prior to hospitalization for Covid-19, 79 patients (71%) were treated for their lymphoma. Among them, 63 (57%) received an anti-CD20 therapy. Fourteen patients (12%) had relapsed/refractory disease. The median LOS was 14 days (range, 1-235). After a median follow-up of 191 days (3-260), the 6-month overall survival was 69%. In multivariable analyses, recent administration of anti-CD20 therapy was associated with prolonged LOS (subdistribution hazard ratio 2.26, 95% confidence interval 1.42-3.6, p < 0.001) and higher risk of death (hazard ratio 2.17, 95% confidence interval 1.04-4.52, p = 0.039). An age &#8805; 70 years and relapsed/refractory lymphoma were also associated with prolonged LOS and decreased overall survival. In conclusion, an age &#8805; 70 years, a relapsed/refractory lymphoma and recent administration of anti-CD20 therapy are risk factors for prolonged LOS and death for lymphoma patients hospitalized for Covid-19. These findings may contribute to guide the management of lymphoma during the pandemic, support evaluating specific therapeutic approaches, and raise questions on the efficacy and timing of vaccination of this particular population.","Duléry, Rémy; Lamure, Sylvain; Delord, Marc; Di Blasi, Roberta; Chauchet, Adrien; Hueso, Thomas; Rossi, Cédric; Drenou, Bernard; Deau Fischer, Bénédicte; Soussain, Carole; Feugier, Pierre; Noël, Nicolas; Choquet, Sylvain; Bologna, Serge; Joly, Bertrand; Philippe, Laure; Kohn, Milena; Malak, Sandra; Fouquet, Guillemette; Daguindau, Etienne; Taoufik, Yassine; Lacombe, Karine; Cartron, Guillaume; Thiéblemont, Catherine; Besson, Caroline",Am. j. hematol,,472

Those most likely to become seriously ill with COVID-19 are adults, especially the elderly and those who are already weak or sick. At present, a specific drug for treatment of COVID-19 has not been developed. This, combined with the typical coexistence of a variety of chronic diseases in elderly patients, makes treatment challenging at present. In addition, for elderly patients, COVID-19 isolation measures during the epidemic can easily lead to psychological problems. Thus, how to manage elderly patients has become a focus of social attention in the current circumstances. This article reviews the effects of COVID-19 and makes management suggestions for elderly patients during this epidemic period. In addition to the elderly, critically ill people are also highly susceptible to this novel coronavirus. For elderly COVID-19 patients, antiviral therapy, immune regulation, and even auxiliary respiratory therapy can be given after a comprehensive evaluation of the disease.

The main objective of this study was to report the real-time effective reproduction numbers (R(t)) and case fatality rates (CFR) in Europe. METHODS: Data for this study were obtained mainly from the World Health Organization website, up to March 9, 2020. R(t) were estimated by exponential growth rate (EG) and time-dependent (TD) methods. 'R0' package in R was employed to estimate R(t) by fitting the existing epidemic curve. Both the naïve CFR (nCFR) and adjusted CFR (aCFR) were estimated. RESULTS: With the EG method, R(t) was 3.27 (95% confidence interval (CI) 3.17-3.38) for Italy, 6.32 (95% CI 5.72-6.99) for France, 6.07 (95% CI 5.51-6.69) for Germany, and 5.08 (95% CI 4.51-5.74) for Spain. With the TD method, the R value for March 9 was 3.10 (95% CI 2.21-4.11) for Italy, 6.56 (95% CI 2.04-12.26) for France, 4.43 (95% CI 1.83-7.92) for Germany, and 3.95 (95% CI 0-10.19) for Spain. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides important findings on the early outbreak of COVID-19 in Europe. Due to the recent rapid increase in new cases of COVID-19, real-time monitoring of the transmissibility and mortality in Spain and France is a priority.","Yuan, Jing; Li, Minghui; Lv, Gang; Lu, Z Kevin",Int J Infect Dis,,472
516497,International law and human security in a kaleidoscopic world,2020,"Electronic structure/Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel-Marcus Master equation calculations were applied to unravel the oxidation mechanism and kinetics of the cyclopenta[a]naphthalenyl radical with molecular oxygen. The reaction has been shown to proceed through the addition of O2 in the ortho-position in the five-membered ring of C13H9. At low temperatures, the reaction yields a collisionally stabilized C13H9O2 complex, which rapidly decomposes back to the reactants. In the high-temperature regime, above 800, 900, 1125, and 1375 K at pressures of 0.03, 1, 10, and 100 atm, respectively, the reaction forms bimolecular products including 3H-/1H-cyclopenta[a]naphthalen-3-one + OH as the prevailing product together with 1-ethanol-substituted 2-naphthyl radical + CO and 3H-benzo[f]chromen-3-one + H as minor ones, with the branching ratio of the OH elimination channel growing with temperature and the rate constants for the individual bimolecular channels being independent of pressure. The calculated rate constants and product branching for cyclopenta[a]naphthalenyl + O2 closely agree with those reported earlier for the indenyl + O2 reaction and are recommended for the combustion kinetic models for the oxidation reactions of five-membered rings on free edges of larger polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules. The results also confirm that the oxidation of a &#960; radical located on a five-membered ring with molecular oxygen is very slow.","Ghildina, A R; Zavershinskiy, I P; Mebel, A M; Vinogradov, K Yu; Bulanova, A V; Zhu, Hong",J. phys. chem.

Here, we estimate the relationship between air temperature, specific humidity, and ultraviolet radiation and SARS-CoV-2 transmission in 2669 U.S. counties with abundant reported cases from March 15 to December 31, 2020. Specifically, we quantify the associations of daily mean temperature, specific humidity, and ultraviolet radiation with daily estimates of the SARS-CoV-2 reproduction number (Rt) and calculate the fraction of Rt attributable to these meteorological conditions. Lower air temperature (within the 20-40 °C range), lower specific humidity, and lower ultraviolet radiation were significantly associated with increased Rt. The fraction of Rt attributable to temperature, specific humidity, and ultraviolet radiation were 3.73% (95% empirical confidence interval [eCI]: 3.66-3.76%), 9.35% (95% eCI: 9.27-9.39%), and 4.44% (95% eCI: 4.38-4.47%), respectively. In total, 17.5% of Rt was attributable to meteorological factors. The fractions attributable to meteorological factors generally were higher in northern counties than in southern counties. Our findings indicate that cold and dry weather and low levels of ultraviolet radiation are moderately associated with increased SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility, with humidity playing the largest role.","Ma, Yiqun; Pei, Sen; Shaman, Jeffrey; Dubrow, Robert; Chen, Kai",Nat Commun,,472

The complete genome sequences show that the two isolates belong to the B1.1 lineage, but contain a nucleotide mutation in the ORF6, leading to a stop codon and to the deletion of 6 amino acids in the C terminus. This deletion was unique, compared to the currently available sequences deposited in the GISAID and GenBank database. It did not affect the in vitro viral replication, neither the neutralizing activities of the patients' antibodies. Based on homology analysis with other Coronaviruses, the two isolated lacked the ORF6 aminoacidic portion responsible for the inhibition of the antiviral Interferon (IFN)-based host response. IFN seems to have a dual role of in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients: not only antiviral activity, but also a detrimental role in case of excessive production. A deletion in the SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 protein might have a specific, still unknown role in the viral pathogenesis.","Delbue, Serena; D039,; Alessandro, Sarah; Signorini, Lucia; Dolci, Maria; Pariani, Elena; Bianchi, Michele; Fattori, Stefania; Modenese, Annalisa; Galli, Cristina; Eberini, Ivano; Ferrante, Pasquale",Emerg Microbes Infect,,472

It is essential for OABD to adhere to the COVID-19 measures, with potential consequences for the psychiatric symptoms. This situation offers the unique opportunity to investigate factors of vulnerability and resilience that are associated with psychiatric symptoms in OABD. METHODS: This study included 81 OABD patients aged over 50 years. Factors measured at baseline in patients that participated in 2017/2018 were compared with factors measured during the COVID-19 outbreak. RESULTS: Participants experienced less psychiatric symptoms during COVID-19 than (67.9% euthymic) than at baseline (40.7% euthymic). There was no difference in loneliness between COVID-19 and baseline. Not having children, more feelings of loneliness, lower mastery, passive coping style and neuroticism were associated with more psychiatric symptoms during COVID-19 measures. CONCLUSIONS: Participants experienced less psychiatric symptoms during COVID-19 measures when compared to baseline. Our results indicate promising targets for psychological interventions aimed at curing and preventing recurrence in OABD and improving quality of life in this growing vulnerable group.","Orhan, Melis; Korten, Nicole; Paans, Nadine; de Walle, Bodine; Kupka, Ralph; van Oppen, Patricia; Kok, Almar; Sonnenberg, Caroline; Schouws, Sigfried; Dols, Annemiek",Int. j. geriatr. psychiatry,,472

Clinical Case: A 64-year-old man (BMI 25kg/m2, weight 75kg) with past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus (on metformin and sitagliptin;glycated haemoglobin 51 mmol/mol, n&amp;lt;42mmol/mol), hypertension, G6PD deficiency and gout was admitted to hospital with COVID pneumonitis and type 1 respiratory failure giving 5 days’ history of cough, shortness of breath, fatigue and tiredness. As per hospital guidelines, the patient was treated with amoxicillin/clavulanate 625mg three times daily and doxycycline 100mg once daily. Hydroxycholoroquine was not given in view of G6PD deficiency. There was no evidence of diabetic ketoacidosis and a short-acting insulin sliding scale was initiated at 2U/hr. Continuous positive pressure ventilation was offered for next 72 hours, however the patient failed to improve and required transfer to intensive care unit for intubation and mechanical ventilation. Computer tomography scan of pulmonary artery excluded embolism. The patient was fed via nasogastric tube post intubation. On day 8, the patient experienced a sudden drop in haemoglobin levels from 132 g/dl on day 1 to 68 g/dl, requiring multiple blood transfusions. The blood results demonstrated evidence of haemolysis with a rise in total and direct bilirubin and lactate dehydrogenase levels. The peripheral blood smear showed numerous bite cells with polychromasia suggesting an acute haemolytic crisis in the context of G6PD deficiency. A medication review revealed no evidence of drug-induced haemolysis. Later the patient was started on dexamethasone 6mg once daily (day 11) and on remdesivir 100mg once daily (day 15). During this time, the patient’s insulin infusion requirements had progressively increased from 2U/hr to 8U/hr (equivalent to 192 units/24 hr). On day 22, the patient’s clinical condition deteriorated with septicaemia requiring extended course of antibiotics. At this time, continuous insulin infusion was stopped and intermediate acting insulin (insulatard 36U twice daily;later increased to 48U twice daily) was started. In the next 10 days, the patient made good clinical recovery from sepsis with stable haemoglobin and blood sugar levels. He was extubated and transferred for rehabilitation. The patient was successfully weaned off insulin in the community with optimal diabetes control. Conclusion: This is a case demonstrating the possible role of SARS-CoV-2 in increased insulin resistance and severe haemolytic crisis on background of diabetes and G6PD deficiency.","Joshi, Hareesh Earle Kenneth",Journal of the Endocrine Society,,472

The plants were placed in geminated pots using a split-root technique. One of the pots in the geminated set was filled with a complete nutrient solution without La, while another was filled with a nutrient solution without phosphorus but containing different concentrations of La. It was verified that roots of maize plants can accumulate approximately sixty percent more La than shoots. Moreover, low La concentrations stimulated an increase in chlorophyll index,resulting in a slight increase in shoot biomass. At higher levels, La didnt reduce growth but caused adecrease in both photosynthetic rate and chlorophyll index.(AU)","Duarte, Ana Carolina Oliveira; Oliveira, Cynthia de; Ramos, Sílvio Junio; Castro, Evaristo Mauro de; Siqueira, José Oswaldo; Guilherme, Luiz Roberto Guimarães",Acta Sci.

Local cycles of transmission have already occurred in 12 countries after case importation. In Africa, Egypt has so far confirmed one case. The management and control of COVID-19 importations heavily rely on a country's health capacity. Here we evaluate the preparedness and vulnerability of African countries against their risk of importation of COVID-19. METHODS: We used data on the volume of air travel departing from airports in the infected provinces in China and directed to Africa to estimate the risk of importation per country. We determined the country's capacity to detect and respond to cases with two indicators: preparedness, using the WHO International Health Regulations Monitoring and Evaluation Framework; and vulnerability, using the Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index. Countries were clustered according to the Chinese regions contributing most to their risk. FINDINGS: Countries with the highest importation risk (ie, Egypt, Algeria, and South Africa) have moderate to high capacity to respond to outbreaks. Countries at moderate risk (ie, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Sudan, Angola, Tanzania, Ghana, and Kenya) have variable capacity and high vulnerability. We identified three clusters of countries that share the same exposure to the risk originating from the provinces of Guangdong, Fujian, and the city of Beijing, respectively. INTERPRETATION: Many countries in Africa are stepping up their preparedness to detect and cope with COVID-19 importations. Resources, intensified surveillance, and capacity building should be urgently prioritised in countries with moderate risk that might be ill-prepared to detect imported cases and to limit onward transmission.

Crystal structures of Nsp15 from different coronaviruses have shown a common hexameric assembly, yet how the enzyme recognizes and processes RNA remains poorly understood. Here we report a series of cryo-EM reconstructions of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp15, in both apo and UTP-bound states. The cryo-EM reconstructions, combined with biochemistry, mass spectrometry, and molecular dynamics, expose molecular details of how critical active site residues recognize uridine and facilitate catalysis of the phosphodiester bond. Mass spectrometry revealed the accumulation of cyclic phosphate cleavage products, while analysis of the apo and UTP-bound datasets revealed conformational dynamics not observed by crystal structures that are likely important to facilitate substrate recognition and regulate nuclease activity. Collectively, these findings advance understanding of how Nsp15 processes viral RNA and provide a structural framework for the development of new therapeutics.","Pillon, Monica C.; Frazier, Meredith N.; Dillard, Lucas B.; Williams, Jason G.; Kocaman, Seda; Krahn, Juno M.; Perera, Lalith; Hayne, Cassandra K.; Gordon, Jacob; Stewart, Zachary D.; Sobhany, Mack; Deterding, Leesa J.; Hsu, Allen L.; Dandey, Venkata P.; Borgnia, Mario J.; Stanley, Robin E.",Nat Commun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33504779/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-20608-z,472

It is essential that clinicians remain alert to its various clinical presentations, thoroughly diagnose cases once detected, and treat the primary cause whenever possible. Clinical challenges In the majority of patients, a cause is not found and aggressive immunomodulating therapy of what may become a chronic or recurrent immune-mediated disease must be instigated. As with immune-mediated disease elsewhere, this involves local or systemic immunosuppression with slow tapering and frequent monitoring. The aim of this review is to aid diagnosis and therapy of uveitis by likening it to inflammation elsewhere (because it is more similar than it is different) while highlighting differences (because these are helpful). Global importance Feline uveitis is similar in its presentation throughout the world. Although the list of infectious causes may vary in composition or order of likelihood, idopathic, immune-mediated and neoplastic causes of feline uveitis are univerasal. Patient group Patients of either gender and all ages and breeds are affected by uveitis.

An empirical study of six Asian economies,2011-11-30,"INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a newly identified strain of corona virus that causes illness ranging from the clinical features similar to the common cold to a fatal condition due to severe respiratory failure. According to the WHO, there have been more than 26.3 million confirmed COVID-19 cases in more than 190 countries to date. In light of the outbreak, various treatment modalities have been considered, including traditional medicine, which has been widely used in the pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and H(1)N(1) influenza. Ayurveda contributes a measurable ratio in the world’s traditional practices. As per the guideline of directorate of AYUSH, Government of Madhya Pradesh, cases of COVID-19 were intervened with Arogya Kashayam (AK-20), a decoction prepared from the herbs at 88 COVID Care Centers (CCC) across the state. AIM: To evaluate retrospectively, the effect of the intervention of AK-20 in COVID-19 positive cases as stand alone or in combination with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) administered at CCC in Madhya Pradesh. MATERIALS AND METHODS: It is a retrospective study with 4432 COVID-19 reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) tested positive cases including 2750 males and 1682 females between 5 and 80 years of age. All the cases were intervened with AK-20 as stand alone or in combination with HCQ. Moreover, these patients were also given Zinc and Vitamin C simultaneously. The intervention of AK-20 was made through the district level government AYUSH machinery, and the related data were collected in specially designed case report form. The data were analyzed retrospectively, and outcomes included the RTPCR testing or asymptomatic discharge from the CCC as per the prevailing ICMR guidelines. RESULTS: The present study reveals that out of 4432 COVID-19 RTPCR-positive cases, 2817 (63.56%) received HCQ with AK-20 and 1615 cases (36.43%) received AK-20 as a stand alone treatment. Among the cases that received HCQ and AK-20, 2681 cases (94.17%) recovered completely in an average of 6.8 days and among those who were on standalone AK-20, 1502 cases (93.00%) recovered completely in the same average days. The Chi-square test showed that both the groups were equally effective (P < 0.01; F = 0.3764). CONCLUSION: The retrospective analysis showed that the treatment practices of AK-20 standalone or in combination with HCQ applied in COVID-19 positive cases at CCC in Madhya Pradesh were effective against SARS coronavirus 2 disease. A significant number of cases was tested negative or asymptomatically discharged from both the groups of interventions. Moreover, AK-20 alone has shown statistically equal results to that when used in combination with HCQ therapy.","Shukla, Umesh; Srivastava, Sanjay; Gupta, Pankaj; Ujjaliya, Nitin",Ayu,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33935437/; https://doi.org/10.4103/ayu.ayu_365_20,472

Three subsamples were identified: 18–30; 30–50; > 50 years. The population suffers from anxiety and depression. Youth reported lower levels of living space, occupational activity, social contact and alcohol use, but higher anxiety, depression and uncertainty than older participants. This psychological distress can be explained by lockdown conditions (differently according to age) and by intolerance to uncertainty. Also, youth's alcohol intake has decreased.

Bypassing local R&D units in foreign university collaboration,2021-04-12,"Breast cancer is the most prevailing cancer in the world and each year affecting millions of women. It is also the cause of largest number of deaths in women dying in cancers. During the last few years, researchers are proposing different convolutional neural network models in order to facilitate diagnostic process of breast cancer. Convolutional neural networks are showing promising results to classify cancers using image datasets. There is still a lack of standard models which can claim the best model because of unavailability of large datasets that can be used for models’ training and validation. Hence, researchers are now focusing on leveraging the transfer learning approach using pre-trained models as feature extractors that are trained over millions of different images. With this motivation, this paper considers eight different fine-tuned pre-trained models to observe how these models classify breast cancers applying on ultrasound images. We also propose a shallow custom convolutional neural network that outperforms the pre-trained models with respect to different performance metrics. The proposed model shows 100% accuracy and achieves 1.0 AUC score, whereas the best pre-trained model shows 92% accuracy and 0.972 AUC score. In order to avoid biasness, the model is trained using the fivefold cross validation technique. Moreover, the model is faster in training than the pre-trained models and requires a small number of trainable parameters. The Grad-CAM heat map visualization technique also shows how perfectly the proposed model extracts important features to classify breast cancers.","Masud, Mehedi; Eldin Rashed, Amr E.; Hossain, M.

619984,Approaches to Measuring and Forecasting Remote Employment,2021-08-02,"Since Dec 2019, the COVID-19 epidemic has spread over the globe creating one of the greatest pandemics ever witnessed. This epidemic wave will only begin to roll back once a critical proportion of the population is immunised, either by mounting natural immunity following infection, or by vaccination. The latter option can minimise the cost in terms of human lives but it requires to wait until a safe and efficient vaccine is developed, a period estimated to last at least 18 months. In this work, we use optimal control theory to explore the best strategy to implement while waiting for the vaccine. We seek a solution minimizing deaths and costs due to the implementation of the control strategy itself. We find that such a solution leads to an increasing level of control with a maximum reached near the fourth month of the epidemics and a steady decrease until vaccine deployment. This strategy strongly outperforms others with constant or cycling allocations of the same amount of resources to control the outbreak.

GBS has multiple subtypes including acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (AIDP), acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN) and acute motor sensory axonal neuropathy (AMSAN), which can make GBS difficult to diagnose. GBS commonly presents after viral infections such as influenza virus, campylobacter jejuni, and zika virus. GBS commonly presents with a prolonged clinical course leading to increased morbidity among affected patients. It is not surprising that COVID-19 has been connected with multiple cases of GBS, which may alter the recovery course for several patients post-COVID. In this report, we present a case of 69-year-old-female who presented with progressive motor weakness and loss of sensation in her extremities after testing positive for antibodies to COVID-19 one-month prior to presentation.

Understanding their dynamics is important in a variety of situations ranging from industrial processes to pure and applied science. In all these fields, a deep knowledge of the statistical structure of temperature and velocity space/time fluctuations is of paramount importance to construct models of chemical reaction (in chemistry), of condensation of virus-containing droplets (in virology and/or biophysics), and optimal mixing strategies in industrial applications. As a matter of fact, results of turbulence in a puff are confined to bulk properties (i.e. average puff velocity and typical decay/growth time) and dates back to the second half of the 20th century. There is thus a huge gap to fill to pass from bulk properties to two-point statistical observables. Here we fill this gap exploiting theory and numerics in concert to predict and validate the space/time scaling behaviors of both velocity and temperature structure functions including intermittency corrections. Excellent agreement between theory and simulations is found. Our results are expected to have profound impact to develop evaporation models for virus-containing droplets carried by a turbulent puff, with benefits to the comprehension of the airborne route of virus contagion.","Mazzino, Andrea; Rosti, Marco E",Phys Rev Lett,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.11529v1.pdf; https://doi.org/10.1103/physrevlett.127.094501; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34506163/,472

This study is the first investigation of the prevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 among blood donors in Saudi Arabia. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among blood donors in Saudi Arabia during the early phase of the current pandemic. METHODS: Serology results and epidemiological data were analyzed for 837 adult blood donors, with no confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, in Saudi Arabia from 20 to 25 May 2020. Seroprevalence was determined using electrochemical immunoassay for detecting anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. RESULTS: The overall seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was 1.4% (12/837). Non-citizens had higher prevalence compared to citizens (odds ratio 13.6, p = 0.001). Having a secondary education as the highest level of education was also significantly associated with high seroprevalence compared to higher education (odds ratio 6.8, p = 0.005). The data showed that the highest seroprevalence was in Makkah (8.1%), Madinah (4.1% with an OR of 0.48 (95% CI: 0.12-1.94), Jeddah (2.3%; OR 0.27; 95%CI: 0.31-2.25), and Qassim (2.9 %, OR: 0.34; 95%CI: 0.04-2.89) and these were not statistically different from the seroprevalence in Makkah region. CONCLUSIONS: At the early stage of the pandemic in Saudi Arabia, the seroprevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 among blood donors was low but was higher among non-citizens These findings showed that non-citizens and the less educated may be less attentive to preventive measures. Monitoring seroprevalence trend over time require repeated sampling.","Banjar, Ayman; Al-Tawfiq, Jaffar A.; Alruwaily, Amaal; Alserehi, Haleema; Al-Qunaibet, Ada; Alaswad, Rehab; Almutlaq, Hind; Almudaiheem, Abdullah; Khojah, Abdullah T.; Alsaif, Faisal; Almolad, Shaza Karim; Alqahtani, Saeed; AlJurayyan, Abdullah; Alotaibi, Abdullah; Almalki, Safar; Abuhaimed, Yousef; Alkhashan, Abdullah; Alfaifi, Amal; Alabdulkareem, Khaled; Jokhdar, Hani; Assiri, Abdullah; Almudarra, Sami",Int J Infect Dis,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971221000400; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971221000400?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2021.01.028; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33465488/,472
627778,The Challenge of Generating Sustainable Value: Narratives About Sustainability in the Italian Tourism Sector,2020-12-23,"Epidemics such as COVID-19 and corresponding containment measures are assumed to cause psychological stress. In a survey during the lockdown in Switzerland (n = 1565), we found substantially increased levels of stress in the population. In particular, individuals who did not agree with the containment measures, as well as those who saw nothing positive in the crisis, experienced high levels of stress. In contrast, individuals who are part of a risk group or who are working in healthcare or in essential shops experienced similar stress levels as the general public. The psychological mechanisms that determine stress, caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and containment measures, are not yet clear. Thus, we conducted a path analysis to gain a deeper understanding of the psychological mechanisms that lead to stress. Experiencing fear of the disease is a key driver for being worried. Our model further shows that worries about the individual, social, and economic consequences of the crisis, strongly boost stress. The infection rate in the canton (i.e., state) of residence also contributes to stress. Positive thinking and perceived social, organizational, and governmental support mitigate worries and stress. Our findings indicate that containment measures increase worries and stress, especially for those who feel that these measures either are not sufficient or go too far. Thus, highlighting positive aspects of the crisis and convincing people of the effectiveness and necessity of mitigation measures can, not only promote compliance, but also reduce stress. Our model suggests that people who feel protected by the authorities have fewer worries, which can, in turn, limit the negative impact of the crisis on mental health.","Wissmath, Bartholomäus; Mast, Fred W.; Kraus, Fabian; Weibel, David",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0254883; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34324498/,472

The objective of this study is to identify the clinical risk factors of SARS and to develop a scoring system for early diagnosis. METHODS: The detailed clinical data of all patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with a temperature higher than 38.0°C (100.3°F), documented at home or at the ED, and risks of exposure to SARS within 14 days were assessed. The diagnosis of probable SARS was made according to the definition of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Items with significant differences among symptoms, signs, and laboratory tests on presentation between SARS and non-SARS groups were determined and used to develop the scoring system. RESULTS: Seventy patients were enrolled and 8 were diagnosed as probably having SARS. None of the initially discharged patients or their relatives developed SARS. Compared with the non-SARS group, the SARS group was younger (33.9±15.9 years versus 44±9.8 years; P=.02), had a higher percentage of fever prolonged more than 5 days (87.5% versus 6.5%; P<.01), myalgia (75% versus 27.4%; P=.01), and diarrhea (50% versus 9.7%; P=.02); had less occurrence of cough before or during fever (0% versus 64.5%; P=.01); and had lower absolute lymphocyte (0.9±0.3×10(9)/L versus 1.5±1.1×10(9)/L; P<.01) and platelet counts (144.1±36.3×10(9)/L versus 211.6±78.8×10(9)/L; P=.02). A 4-item symptom score based on the presence of cough before or concomitant with fever, myalgia, diarrhea, and rhinorrhea or sore throat detects SARS with 100% sensitivity and 75.9% specificity; a 6-item clinical score based on lymphopenia (<1.0×10(9)/L), thrombocytopenia (<150×10(9)/L) and the 4 symptom items detects SARS with 100% sensitivity and 86.3% specificity.

However, little is known about the molecular protein profile of this devastating virus. This work represents a thorough bioinformatics analysis of the regularities of charge distribution (polar profiles) in two groups of proteins and their functional domains associated with Ebola virus disease: Ebola virus proteins and Human proteins interacting with Ebola virus. Our analysis reveals that a fragment exists in each of these proteins—one named the “functional domain”—with the polar profile similar to the polar profile of the protein that contains it. Each protein is formed by a group of short sub-sequences, where each fragment has a different and distinctive polar profile and where the polar profile between adjacent short sub-sequences changes orderly and gradually to coincide with the polar profile of the whole protein. When using the charge distribution as a metric, it was observed that it effectively discriminates the proteins from their functional domains. As a counterexample, the same test was applied to a set of synthetic proteins built for that purpose, revealing that any of the regularities reported here for the Ebola virus proteins and human proteins interacting with Ebola virus were not present in the synthetic proteins. Our results indicate that the polar profile of each protein studied and its corresponding functional domain are similar. Thus, when building each protein from its functional domai—adding one amino acid at a time and plotting each time its polar profile—it was observed that the resulting graphs can be divided into groups with similar polar profiles.","Polanco, Carlos; Samaniego Mendoza, José Lino; Buhse, Thomas; Uversky, Vladimir N.; Bañuelos Chao, Ingrid Paola; Bañuelos Cedano, Marcela Angola; Tavera, Fernando Michel; Tavera, Daniel Michel; Falconi, Manuel; Ponce de León, Abelardo Vela",Cell Biochem Biophys,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29511990/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s12013-018-0839-4,472

Furthermore, the secondary aim is to observe the relationship between perceived stress, psychological health, physical activity, and nature exposure in Germany and France during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related lockdown of April/May 2020. Methods: The study includes 419 participants who have completed the Perceived Stress Scale 10, the World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF, the Godin-Shephard Leisure-Time Physical Activity Questionnaire, the modified Nature Exposure Scale, and complementary questions related to the lockdown period from April 19 to May 11, 2020. Multiple regression models were constructed to evaluate the relationship of nature exposure and physical exercise with overall stress perception and psychological health in France and Germany when considering a broad range of covariates. Results: Exposure to nature during the lockdown (ηp(2) = 0.034, p < 0.001), amount of physical activity ηp(2) = 0.014, p < 0.001), and psychological health (ηp(2) = 0.041, p < 0.001) were greater in German compared with French participants. Godin Index and Nature Exposure Scale total score were both inversely correlated to stress perception and positively correlated to psychological health. The stress and psychological health regression models explained 10% of the results' variance. Physical activity (Godin Index) was a significant for both models. Nature Exposure Scale total score was a significant predictor only for psychological health. When including all significant covariates, the regression models explained 30.7% for the perceived stress and 42.1% for the psychological health total overall variance. Conclusion: Physical activity and nature exposure are significant predictors of psychological health. Even though both variables are associated with stress perception, only physical activity is a significant predictor of stress perception. Our results suggest that physical activity and nature exposure were key factors to go through the lockdown period in France and Germany.","Javelle, Florian; Laborde, Sylvain; Hosang, Thomas Jean; Metcalfe, Alan James; Zimmer, Philipp",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33746842/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.623946,472

Clearly, novel antiviral compounds for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients are still urgently needed. Complementary medicine is used along with standard medical treatment and accessible to a vast majority of people worldwide. Natural products with antiviral activity may contribute to improve the overall condition of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. In the present study, we investigated the antiviral activity of glycyrrhizin, the primary active ingredient of the licorice root, against SARS-CoV-2. We demonstrated that glycyrrhizin potently inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro. Furthermore, we uncovered the underlying mechanism and showed that glycyrrhizin blocks the viral replication by inhibiting the viral main protease M(pro) that is essential for viral replication. Our data indicate that the consumption of glycyrrhizin-containing products such as licorice root tea of black licorice may be of great benefit for SARS-CoV-2 infected people. Furthermore, glycyrrhizin is a good candidate for further investigation for clinical use to treat COVID-19 patients.","van de Sand, Lukas; Bormann, Maren; Alt, Mira; Schipper, Leonie; Heilingloh, Christiane Silke; Steinmann, Eike; Todt, Daniel; Dittmer, Ulf; Elsner, Carina; Witzke, Oliver; Krawczyk, Adalbert",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v13040609; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33918301/,472

The objective of this study was to assess body composition measures obtained on opportunistic abdominal CTs as predictors of outcome in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. We hypothesized that elevated visceral and intermuscular adipose tissue would be associated with adverse outcome. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Our retrospective study was IRB-approved and HIPAA-compliant. The study group comprised 124 patients (median age: 68 years, IQR: 56, 77; 59 weeks, 65 months) who were admitted with COVID-19 to a single hospital and who had undergone abdominal CT for clinical purposes. Visceral adipose tissue (VAT), subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), intermuscular adipose tissue (IMAT), and paraspinal and abdominal muscle cross-sectional areas (CSA) were assessed. Clinical information including prognostic factors, time of admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) and time of death within 28 days were obtained. Multivariate time-to-event competing risk models were fitted to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) for a composite outcome of ICU admission/mortality associated with a one standard deviation increase in each body compositional measure. Each model was adjusted for age, sex, race, BMI, and cardiometabolic comorbidities. RESULTS: There were 50 patients who were admitted to the ICU or deceased over a median time of 1 day [IQR 1, 6] from hospital admission. Higher VAT/SAT ratio (HR of 1.30; 95% CI 1.04–1.62, p = 0.022) and higher IMAT CSA (HR of 1.44; 95% CI 1.10–1.89, p = 0.008) were associated with a reduced time to ICU admission or death in adjusted models. CONCLUSION: VAT/SAT and IMAT are predictors of adverse outcome in patients hospitalized with COVID-19, independent of other established prognostic factors. This suggests that body composition measures may serve as novel biomarkers of outcome in patients with COVID-19.","Bunnell, Katherine M.; Thaweethai, Tanayott; Buckless, Colleen; Shinnick, Daniel J.; Torriani, Martin; Foulkes, Andrea S.; Bredella, Miriam A.",Int J Obes (Lond),https://doi.org/10.1038/s41366-021-00907-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34244597/,472

SARS-CoV-2 infections of feline and canine species have also been reported. However, it is not entirely clear to what extent natural SARS-CoV-2 infection of pet dogs and cats is in households. We have developed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) using recombinant SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein and the receptor-binding-domain (RBD) of the spike protein, and the SARS-CoV-2 spike-pseudotyped vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-based neutralization assay to screen serum samples of 239 pet cats and 510 pet dogs in Minnesota in the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic from mid-April to early June 2020 for evidence of SARS-CoV-2 exposures. A cutoff value was used to identify the seropositive samples in each experiment. The average seroprevalence of N- and RBD-specific antibodies in pet cats were 8% and 3%, respectively. Among nineteen (19) N-seropositive cat sera, fifteen (15) exhibited neutralizing activity and seven (7) were also RBD-seropositive. The N-based ELISA is also specific and does not cross react with antigens of common feline coronaviruses. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected at a very low percentage in pet dogs (~ 1%) and were limited to IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 N protein with no neutralizing activities. Our results demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 seropositive rates are higher in pet cats than in pet dogs in MN early in the pandemic and that SARS-CoV-2 N-specific IgG antibodies can detect SARS-CoV-2 infections in companion animals with higher levels of specificity and sensitivity than RBD-specific IgG antibodies in ELISA-based assays.","Dileepan, Mythili; Di, Da; Huang, Qinfeng; Ahmed, Shamim; Heinrich, Daniel; Ly, Hinh; Liang, Yuying",Virulence,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34125647/; https://doi.org/10.1080/21505594.2021.1936433,472

However, information about the relationship between viral infections and atopy among children whose attacks of wheezing lead to hospitalization is unclear. Objective To evaluate the prevalence of viral respiratory tract pathogens among infants and children hospitalized for wheezing and to analyze the results in relation to the patient's age, atopic characteristics, and season of admission. Methods This was a case-control study of children (age 2 months to 18 years) admitted for wheezing to the University of Virginia Medical Center over a period of 12 months. Children without wheezing were enrolled as controls. Nasal secretions were evaluated for viral pathogens by using cultures, PCR tests, and antigen detection. Total IgE and specific IgE antibody to common aeroallergens was measured in serum. Results Seventy percent of children hospitalized for wheezing before age 3 years (n=79) were admitted between December and March, whereas 46% of children age 3 to 18 years (n=54) were hospitalized between September and November. Among children younger than 3 years, viral pathogens were detected in 84% (66/79) of wheezing children and 55% (42/77) of controls (P < .001). Respiratory syncytial virus was the dominant pathogen during the winter months, but rhinovirus was more common during other months. Total serum IgE levels were generally low, and values from wheezing and control subjects overlapped considerably. Among children 3 years and older, 61% (33/54) of subjects admitted for wheezing tested positive for virus (predominantly rhinovirus), compared with 21% (12/56) of controls (P < .001). The total serum IgE values among wheezing children (geometric mean, 386 IU/mL; 95% CI, 259-573) were substantially elevated compared with those of controls (geometric mean, 38 IU/mL; 95% CI, 26-56; P < .001). A significantly higher percentage of wheezing children compared with controls was sensitized to at least 1 of the inhaled allergens tested: 84% (36/43) compared with 33% (15/45; P < .001). The atopic characteristics of wheezing children who tested positive or negative for virus were similar. Conclusions Viral infections were the dominant risk factor for wheezing among children hospitalized before 3 years of age. By comparison, a large majority of the wheezing children age 3 to 18 years had striking atopic characteristics that may be critical as a risk factor for hospitalization and an adverse response to viral infections, especially infections caused by rhinovirus.","Heymann, Peter W; Carper, Holliday T; Murphy, Deborah D; Platts-Mills, Thomas A.E; Patrie, James; McLaughlin, Anne P; Erwin, Elizabeth A; Shaker, Marcus S; Hellems, Martha; Peerzada, Jehanna; Hayden, Frederick G; Hatley, Tina K; Chamberlain, Rachel",Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0091674904013119; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15316497/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091674904013119,472

Methods: The study population comprised 3,249 predominantly male, 18-20-year-old Marine recruits. Upon arrival at a Marine-supervised two-week quarantine, participants were assessed for baseline SARS-CoV-2 IgG seropositivity, defined as a 1:150 dilution or greater on receptor binding domain and full-length spike protein enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA) assays. SARS-CoV-2 infection was assessed by PCR at initiation, middle and end of the quarantine. After appropriate exclusions, including participants with a positive PCR during quarantine, we performed three biweekly PCR tests in both seropositive and in seronegative groups once recruits left quarantine and entered basic training and baseline neutralizing antibody titers on all subsequently infected seropositive and selected seropositive uninfected participants. Findings: Among 189 seropositive participants, 19 (10.1%) had at least one positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 during the six-week follow-up (1.1 cases per person-year). In contrast, 1,079 (48.0%) of the 2,247 seronegative participants tested positive (6.2 cases per person-year). The incidence rate ratio was 0.18 (95% CI 0.11-0.28, p<0.00001). Among seropositive recruits, infection was associated with lower baseline full-length spike protein IgG titers (p<0.0001). Compared with seronegative recruits, seropositive recruits had about 10-fold lower viral loads (ORF1ab gene, p<0.005), and trended towards shorter duration of PCR positivity (p=0.18) and more frequent asymptomatic infections (p=0.13). Among seropositive participants, baseline neutralizing titers were detected in 45 of 54 (83.3%) uninfected and in 6 of 19 (31.6%) infected participants during the 6 weeks of observation (ID50 difference p<.0001). Interpretation: Seropositive young adults had about one-fifth the risk of subsequent infection compared with seronegative individuals. Although antibodies induced by initial infection are largely protective, they do not guarantee effective SARS-CoV-2 neutralization activity or immunity against subsequent infection. These findings may be relevant for optimization of mass vaccination strategies.","Letizia, A. G.; Ge, Y.; Vangeti, S.; Goforth, C.; Weir, D. L.; Kuzmina, N. A.; Chen, H.

646704,Case Study: Free Lunch Meals Provision during the Remote Learning Conditions,2021-02-12,"The Picornaviridae family comprises a large group of non-enveloped viruses that have a major impact on human and veterinary health. The viral genome contains one open reading frame encoding a single polyprotein that can be processed by viral proteinases. The crucial 3C proteinases (3C(pro)s) of picornaviruses share similar spatial structures and it is becoming apparent that 3C(pro) plays a significant role in the viral life cycle and virus host interaction. Importantly, the proteinase and RNA-binding activity of 3C(pro) are involved in viral polyprotein processing and the initiation of viral RNA synthesis. In addition, 3C(pro) can induce the cleavage of certain cellular factors required for transcription, translation and nucleocytoplasmic trafficking to modulate cell physiology for viral replication. Due to interactions between 3C(pro) and these essential factors, 3C(pro) is also involved in viral pathogenesis to support efficient infection. Furthermore, based on the structural conservation, the development of irreversible inhibitors and discovery of non-covalent inhibitors for 3C(pro) are ongoing and a better understanding of the roles played by 3C(pro) may provide insights into the development of potential antiviral treatments. In this review, the current knowledge regarding the structural features, multiple functions in the viral life cycle, pathogen host interaction, and development of antiviral compounds for 3C(pro) is summarized.","Sun, Di; Chen, Shun; Cheng, Anchun; Wang, Mingshu",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v8030082; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26999188/,472

We sought to determine if these findings were associated with a positive CSF severe acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) polymerase chain reaction (PCR). METHODS: We performed a systematic review of Medline and Embase from December 1, 2019 to November 18, 2020. CSF results were evaluated based on the presence/absence of (1) ≥ 1 CNS hyperintense lesion and (2) leptomeningeal enhancement. RESULTS: In 117 publications, we identified 193 patients with COVID‐19 who had an MRI of the CNS and CSF testing. There were 125 (65%) patients with CNS hyperintense lesions. Patients with CNS hyperintense lesions were significantly more likely to have a positive CSF SARS‐CoV‐2 PCR (10% [9/87] vs. 0% [0/43], p = 0.029). Of 75 patients who had a contrast MRI, there were 20 (27%) patients who had leptomeningeal enhancement. Patients with leptomeningeal enhancement were significantly more likely to have a positive CSF SARS‐CoV‐2 PCR (25% [4/16] vs. 5% [2/42], p = 0.024). CONCLUSION: The presence of CNS hyperintense lesions or leptomeningeal enhancement on neuroimaging from patients with COVID‐19 is associated with increased likelihood of a positive CSF SARS‐CoV‐2 PCR. However, a positive CSF SARS‐CoV‐2 PCR is uncommon in patients with these neuroimaging findings, suggesting they are often related to other etiologies, such as inflammation, hypoxia, or ischemia.","Lewis, Ariane; Jain, Rajan; Frontera, Jennifer; Placantonakis, Dimitris G.; Galetta, Steven; Balcer, Laura; Melmed, Kara R.",J Neuroimaging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34105198/; https://doi.org/10.1111/jon.12880,472

Dated to between 13 000 and 16 000 years before the present, the specimens are further evidence of a wider Quaternary distribution for these Vulnerable cervids, are valuable additions to a sparse Pleistocene fossil record and confirm water deer as a component of the Upper Pleistocene fauna of northern Vietnam. Palaeoenvironmental proxies suggest that the Tràng An water deer occupied cooler, but not necessarily drier, conditions than today.

METHODS: We constructed a compartmental model and developed a multistep deep learning methodology to estimate the model’s transmission parameters. We then fed the estimated transmission parameters to the model to predict development of the US COVID-19 epidemic for 35 and 42 days. Epidemics are considered suppressed when the basic reproduction number (R(0)) is less than 1. RESULTS: The deep learning–enhanced compartmental model predicts that R(0) will fall to <1 around August 17-19, 2020, at which point the epidemic will effectively start to die out, and that the US “infected” population will peak around August 16-18, 2020, at 3,228,574 to 3,308,911 individual cases. The model also predicted that the number of accumulative confirmed cases will cross the 5 million mark around August 7, 2020. CONCLUSIONS: Current compartmental models require stochastic parameterization to estimate the transmission parameters. These models’ effectiveness depends upon detailed statistics on transmission characteristics. As an alternative, deep learning techniques are effective in estimating these stochastic parameters with greatly reduced dependency on data particularity.","Deng, Qi",J Med Internet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32763892/; https://doi.org/10.2196/21173,472
647749,Minding morality: ethical artificial societies for public policy modeling,2020-08-07,"Bronchiolitis is the first lower respiratory tract viral infection manifesting in infants younger than 12 months of age. Our aim was to evaluate clinical and serological differences in infants with bronchiolitis from a single or from multiple viruses. Our secondary aim was to investigate differences in recurrent wheezing episodes after 12‐24‐36 months of follow‐up. We reviewed the clinical records for 486 full‐term infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis with at least one virus detected in the nasopharyngeal aspirate. In 431 (88.7%) patients one virus was detected and in 55 (11.3%) infants more than one virus was found. No differences were observed in the length of hospitalization, clinical severity score, O(2) supplementation or admission to the intensive care unit. Single virus was associated with higher serum C‐reactive protein (C‐RP) than infants with multiple viruses and higher blood neutrophil counts. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was the most frequently detected virus. RSV alone was associated with higher C‐RP (P = 0.007), compared to RSV coinfection. Infants with human rhinovirus (hRV) alone had higher white blood cell counts, higher blood neutrophils, and higher serum C‐RP levels than hRV co‐infection (P = 0.029, P = 0.008, P = 0.008). RSV + hRV, the most frequent co‐infection, was associated with lower neutrophil count and lower C‐RP levels (P = 0.008, P = 0.016) and less fever (P = 0.012), when comparing RSV versus hRV versus RSV + hRV. No differences were found in the frequency of recurrent wheezing between single versus multiple viruses after bronchiolitis. Our findings suggest that in infants with bronchiolitis multiple viral co‐infections can occur, without influence in the clinical severity of the disease. Infants with co‐infection seems to mount a lower inflammatory response.","Petrarca, Laura; Nenna, Raffaella; Frassanito, Antonella; Pierangeli, Alessandra; Leonardi, Salvatore; Scagnolari, Carolina; Antonelli, Guido; Papoff, Paola; Moretti, Corrado; Midulla, Fabio",J Med Virol,https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.24994; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29226974/,472

The clinical spectrum of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is wide, with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) occurring in 15% of patients affected, requiring high oxygen support. Currently, there is no clearly effective antiviral therapy. Steroids and immunomodulators are under investigation for potential activity. Little is known about middle and long-term sequelae on respiratory function. According to some authors, COVID-19 could cause pulmonary fibrosis. We report 3 cases of pulmonary fibrosis detected on follow-up computed tomography (CT) imaging in 3 female patients who recovered from COVID-19 pneumonia in Italy (L’Aquila, Abruzzo). CASE REPORTS: All patients were female and had no significant previous respiratory disease or history of smoke exposure, and none had received high-flow oxygen support during treatment of the disease. In all cases, late onset of mild dyspnea, slow and incomplete respiratory recovery, and early evidence of fibrous signs on chest CT scan were characteristic of the clinical course. CONCLUSIONS: This report focuses on a possible scenario of long-term lung damage in COVID-19 pneumonia survivors. Limitations are lack of long-term follow-up and functional data in the very early phase. It is advantageous that all COVID-19 pneumonia patients undergo serial chest CT and spirometry long-term follow-up for at least 1 year to assess residual damage. This is particularly relevant in those with slow respiratory recovery and long hospitalization.","Picchi, Giovanna; Mari, Alessia; Ricciardi, Alessandra; Carucci, Anna Cecilia; Sinatti, Gaia; Cosimini, Benedetta; Di Norcia, Monica; Iapadre, Nerio; Balsano, Clara; Grimaldi, Alessandro",Am J Case Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33219200/; https://doi.org/10.12659/ajcr.926921,472

Methods Only cases meeting the case definition were included in the study. We reviewed the medical records of the cases who were admitted to the local hospitals, interviewed cases by a standard questionnaire, and then described the epidemiologic features and analyzed risk factors by means of a case-control study. We collected pharyngeal swab specimens and sent them to different laboratories for isolation and culture. The laboratory used different detection methods such as DIF, PCR, electron microscope examination and microneutralization assay, to identify and then type the positive specimens. Results A total of 871 cases were reported during the period from April 18 to July 4, 2004. The distribution of onset times presented two peaks, one in late May and another in middle June. The epidemic occurred mainly in the elementary and junior high schools in ten townships of one county, and the mean age of the cases was 12 years (range 7 months to 18 years). The course of the disease was acute, and was characterized by fever accompanied with sore throat and tonsillitis. The WBC count of cases was normal or elevated. The mean duration of illness was 5 days (range 2 to 12 days). No fatalities from illness were reported. A case-control study indicated that the possible risk factors were close contact with a case and/or poultry before onset and sharing of towels among members of the family. The typical CPE was observed through inoculating pharyngeal swab specimens into the HEP-2 cell cultures in different laboratories. An infection of adenovirus type 3 was verified by detecting positive specimens in different methods. Conclusion This investigation demonstrated that the acute respiratory infection in cases was caused by adenovirus type 3. Cases occurred in over 70 schools in ten townships in 2004, and the route of transmission was possibly close contact with cases or droplet transmission.","Bao, Changjun; Dworkin,; Ni, Daxin; Jiang, Renjie; Li, Xian; Wang, Zhongze; Shi, Zhiyang; Li, Liang; Wang, Hua",Journal of Nanjing Medical University,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1007437607600719; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1007437607600719,472
650095,Siberian Development Vector: Based on Cooperation and Interaction,2020-09-24,"There is an “infodemic” associated with the COVID-19 pandemic—an overabundance of valid and invalid information. Health literacy is the ability to access, understand, appraise, and apply health information, making it crucial for navigating coronavirus and COVID-19 information environments. A cross-sectional representative study of participants ≥ 16 years in Germany was conducted using an online survey. A coronavirus-related health literacy measure was developed (HLS-COVID-Q22). Internal consistency was very high (α = 0.940; ρ = 0.891) and construct validity suggests a sufficient model fit, making HLS-COVID-Q22 a feasible tool for assessing coronavirus-related health literacy in population surveys. While 49.9% of our sample had sufficient levels of coronavirus-related health literacy, 50.1% had “problematic” (15.2%) or “inadequate” (34.9%) levels. Although the overall level of health literacy is high, a vast number of participants report difficulties dealing with coronavirus and COVID-19 information. The participants felt well informed about coronavirus, but 47.8% reported having difficulties judging whether they could trust media information on COVID-19. Confusion about coronavirus information was significantly higher among those who had lower health literacy. This calls for targeted public information campaigns and promotion of population-based health literacy for better navigation of information environments during the infodemic, identification of disinformation, and decision-making based on reliable and trustworthy information.","Okan, Orkan; Bollweg, Torsten Michael; Berens, Eva-Maria; Hurrelmann, Klaus; Bauer, Ullrich; Schaeffer, Doris",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17155503; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32751484/,472

At present, there is no reliable risk stratification tool for non-severe COVID-19 patients at admission. We aimed to construct an effective model for early identifying cases at high risk of progression to severe COVID-19. Methods SARS-CoV-2 infected patients from one center in Wuhan city and two centers in Guangzhou city, China were included retrospectively. All patients with non-severe COVID-19 during hospitalization were followed for more than 15 days after admission. Patients who deteriorated to severe or critical COVID-19 and patients who kept non-severe state were assigned to the severe and non-severe group, respectively. We compared the demographic, clinical, and laboratory data between severe and non-severe group. Based on baseline data, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm and logistic regression model were used to construct a nomogram for risk prediction in the train cohort. The predictive accuracy and discriminative ability of nomogram were evaluated by area under the curve (AUC) and calibration curve. Decision curve analysis (DCA) and clinical impact curve analysis (CICA) were conducted to evaluate the clinical applicability of our nomogram. Findings The train cohort consisted of 189 patients, while the two independent validation cohorts consisted of 165 and 18 patients. Among all cases, 72 (19.35%) patients developed severe COVID-19 and 107 (28.76%) patients had one of the following basic disease, including hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease, chronic respiratory disease, tuberculosis disease. We found one demographic and six serological indicators (age, serum lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, the coefficient of variation of red blood cell distribution width (RDW), blood urea nitrogen, albumin, direct bilirubin) are associated with severe COVID-19. Based on these features, we generated the nomogram, which has remarkably high diagnostic accuracy in distinguishing individuals who exacerbated to severe COVID-19 from non-severe COVID-19 (AUC 0.912 [95% CI 0.846-0.978]) in the train cohort with a sensitivity of 85.71 % and specificity of 87.58% ; 0.853 [0.790-0.916] in validation cohort with a sensitivity of 77.5 % and specificity of 78.4%. The calibration curve for probability of severe COVID-19 showed optimal agreement between prediction by nomogram and actual observation. DCA and CICA further indicated that our nomogram conferred significantly high clinical net benefit. Interpretation Our nomogram could help clinicians to early identify patients who will exacerbate to severe COVID-19. And this risk stratification tool will enable better centralized management and early treatment of severe patients, and optimal use of medical resources via patient prioritization and thus significantly reduce mortality rates. The RDW plays an important role in predicting severe COVID-19, implying that the role of RBC in severe disease is underestimated.","Gong, Jiao; Ou, Jingyi; Qiu, Xueping; Jie, Yusheng; Chen, Yaqiong; Yuan, Lianxiong; Cao, Jing; Tan, Mingkai; Xu, Wenxiong; Zheng, Fang; Shi, Yaling; Hu, Bo",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.17.20037515,472

LGBTQ+ young people are more likely than their peers to experience a mental health difficulty and may be less likely to draw on specialist support due to fears of discrimination. However, little is known about LGBTQ+ young people’s experiences and perceptions of self-managing their mental health. Using a multimodal qualitative design, 20 LGBTQ+ young people participated in a telephone interview or an online focus group. A semi-structured schedule was employed to address the research questions, which focussed on LGBTQ+ young people’s experiences and perceptions of self-managing their mental health, what they perceived to stop or help them to self-manage and any perceived challenges to self-management specifically relating to being LGBTQ+ . Reflexive thematic analysis yielded three key themes: (1) self-management strategies and process, (2) barriers to self-management and (3) facilitators to self-management. Participants’ most frequently mentioned self-management strategy was ‘speaking to or meeting up with friends or a partner’. Both barriers and facilitators to self-management were identified which participants perceived to relate to LGBTQ+ identity. Social support, LGBTQ+ youth groups and community support were identified as key facilitators to participants’ self-management of their mental health, which merits further investigation in future research. These findings also have important implications for policy and intervention development concerning LGBTQ+ young people’s mental health.","Town, Rosa; Hayes, Daniel; Fonagy, Peter; Stapley, Emily",Eur Child Adolesc Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00787-021-01783-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33903961/,472

They may be caused by various factors or combinations of factors. Frequently, endothelial dysfunction is involved in either development of the disorder or results from it. On the other hand, the endothelium may be disordered for other reasons, e.g., due to infection, such as COVID-19. The understanding of the role and significance of the endothelium in the body has changed significantly over time—from a simple physical barrier to a complex system encompassing local and systemic regulation of numerous processes in the body. Endothelium disorders may arise from impairment of one or more signaling pathways affecting dilator or constrictor activity, including nitric oxide–cyclic guanosine monophosphate activation, prostacyclin–cyclic adenosine monophosphate activation, phosphodiesterase inhibition, and potassium channel activation or intracellular calcium level inhibition. In this review, plants are summarized as sources of biologically active substances affecting the endothelium.

In this report, we describe an autopsy case of a COVID-19 patient who showed two undiagnosed ulcers at the level of the anterior and posterior walls of the hypopharynx. Molecular testing of viruses involved in pharyngeal ulcers demonstrated the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome – coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA, together with herpes simplex virus 1 DNA. Histopathologic analysis demonstrated full-thickness lympho-monocytic infiltration (mainly composed of CD68-positive cells), with hemorrhagic foci and necrosis of both the mucosal layer and deep skeletal muscle fibers. Fibrin and platelet microthrombi were also found. Cytological signs of HSV-1 induced damage were not found. Cells expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike subunit 1 were immunohistochemically identified in the inflammatory infiltrations. Immunohistochemistry for HSV1 showed general negativity for inflammatory infiltration, although in the presence of some positive cells. Thus, histopathological, immunohistochemical and molecular findings supported a direct role by SARS-CoV-2 in producing local ulcerative damage, although a possible contributory role by HSV-1 reactivation cannot be excluded. From a clinical perspective, this autopsy report of two undiagnosed lesions put the question if ulcers along the GI tract could be more common (but frequently neglected) in COVID-19 patients.","Porzionato, Andrea; Stocco, Elena; Emmi, Aron; Contran, Martina; Macchi, Veronica; Riccetti, Silvia; Sinigaglia, Alessandro; Barzon, Luisa; De Caro, Raffaele",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34290701/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.676828,472

Symptoms such as fever or cough, and signs such as oxygen saturation or lung auscultation findings, are the first and most readily available diagnostic information. Such information could be used to either rule out COVID‐19 disease, or select patients for further diagnostic testing. OBJECTIVES: To assess the diagnostic accuracy of signs and symptoms to determine if a person presenting in primary care or to hospital outpatient settings, such as the emergency department or dedicated COVID‐19 clinics, has COVID‐19 disease or COVID‐19 pneumonia. SEARCH METHODS: On 27 April 2020, we undertook electronic searches in the Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register and the University of Bern living search database, which is updated daily with published articles from PubMed and Embase and with preprints from medRxiv and bioRxiv. In addition, we checked repositories of COVID‐19 publications. We did not apply any language restrictions. SELECTION CRITERIA: Studies were eligible if they included patients with suspected COVID‐19 disease, or if they recruited known cases with COVID‐19 disease and controls without COVID‐19. Studies were eligible when they recruited patients presenting to primary care or hospital outpatient settings. Studies including patients who contracted SARS‐CoV‐2 infection while admitted to hospital were not eligible. The minimum eligible sample size of studies was 10 participants. All signs and symptoms were eligible for this review, including individual signs and symptoms or combinations. We accepted a range of reference standards including reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR), clinical expertise, imaging, serology tests and World Health Organization (WHO) or other definitions of COVID‐19. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Pairs of review authors independently selected all studies, at both title and abstract stage and full‐text stage. They resolved any disagreements by discussion with a third review author. Two review authors independently extracted data and resolved disagreements by discussion with a third review author. Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias using the QUADAS‐2 checklist. Analyses were descriptive, presenting sensitivity and specificity in paired forest plots, in ROC (receiver operating characteristic) space and in dumbbell plots. We did not attempt meta‐analysis due to the small number of studies, heterogeneity across studies and the high risk of bias. MAIN RESULTS: We identified 16 studies including 7706 participants in total. Prevalence of COVID‐19 disease varied from 5% to 38% with a median of 17%. There were no studies from primary care settings, although we did find seven studies in outpatient clinics (2172 participants), and four studies in the emergency department (1401 participants). We found data on 27 signs and symptoms, which fall into four different categories: systemic, respiratory, gastrointestinal and cardiovascular. No studies assessed combinations of different signs and symptoms and results were highly variable across studies. Most had very low sensitivity and high specificity; only six symptoms had a sensitivity of at least 50% in at least one study: cough, sore throat, fever, myalgia or arthralgia, fatigue, and headache. Of these, fever, myalgia or arthralgia, fatigue, and headache could be considered red flags (defined as having a positive likelihood ratio of at least 5) for COVID‐19 as their specificity was above 90%, meaning that they substantially increase the likelihood of COVID‐19 disease when present. Seven studies carried a high risk of bias for selection of participants because inclusion in the studies depended on the applicable testing and referral protocols, which included many of the signs and symptoms under study in this review. Five studies only included participants with pneumonia on imaging, suggesting that this is a highly selected population. In an additional four studies, we were unable to assess the risk for selection bias. These factors make it very difficult to determine the diagnostic properties of these signs and symptoms from the included studies. We also had concerns about the applicability of these results, since most studies included participants who were already admitted to hospital or presenting to hospital settings. This makes these findings less applicable to people presenting to primary care, who may have less severe illness and a lower prevalence of COVID‐19 disease. None of the studies included any data on children, and only one focused specifically on older adults. We hope that future updates of this review will be able to provide more information about the diagnostic properties of signs and symptoms in different settings and age groups. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The individual signs and symptoms included in this review appear to have very poor diagnostic properties, although this should be interpreted in the context of selection bias and heterogeneity between studies. Based on currently available data, neither absence nor presence of signs or symptoms are accurate enough to rule in or rule out disease. Prospective studies in an unselected population presenting to primary care or hospital outpatient settings, examining combinations of signs and symptoms to evaluate the syndromic presentation of COVID‐19 disease, are urgently needed. Results from such studies could inform subsequent management decisions such as self‐isolation or selecting patients for further diagnostic testing. We also need data on potentially more specific symptoms such as loss of sense of smell. Studies in older adults are especially important.","Struyf, Thomas; Deeks, Jonathan J; Dinnes, Jacqueline; Takwoingi, Yemisi; Davenport, Clare; Leeflang, Mariska MG; Spijker, René; Hooft, Lotty; Emperador, Devy; Dittrich, Sabine; Domen, Julie; Horn, Sebastiaan R A; Van den Bruel, Ann",Cochrane Database Syst Rev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32633856/; https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd013665,472

The risk of a severe course of SARS-CoV-2 infection is increased in all but the mildest forms of NMDs. High-risk conditions include reduced airway clearance due to oropharyngeal weakness and risk of worsening with fever, fasting or infection Isolation requirements may have an impact on treatment regimens administered in hospital settings, such as nusinersen, glucosidase alfa, intravenous immunoglobulin, and rituximab infusions. In addition, specific drugs for SARS-CoV2 infection under investigation impair neuromuscular function significantly; chloroquine and azithromycin are not recommended in myasthenia gravis without available ventilatory support and prolonged prone positioning may influence options for treatment. Other therapeutics may affect specific NMDs (metabolic, mitochondrial, myotonic diseases) and experimental approaches for Coronavirus disease 2019 may be offered “compassionately” only after consulting the patient’s NMD specialist. In parallel, the reorganization of hospital and outpatient services may change the management of non-infected NMD patients and their caregivers, favouring at-distance approaches. However, the literature on the validation of telehealth in this subgroup of patients is scant. Thus, as the first wave of the pandemic is progressing, clinicians and researchers should address these crucial open issues to ensure adequate caring for NMD patients.

Crystal structures of almost all available flavivirus methyltransferases contain S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM), the methyl donor molecule that co-purifies with the enzymes. This raises a possibility that SAM is an integral structural component required for the folding of dengue virus (DENV) methyltransferase. Here we exclude this possibility by solving the crystal structure of DENV methyltransferase without SAM. The SAM ligand was removed from the enzyme through a urea-mediated denaturation-and-renaturation protocol. The crystal structure of the SAM-depleted enzyme exhibits a vacant SAM-binding pocket, with a conformation identical to that of the SAM-enzyme co-crystal structure. Functionally, equivalent enzymatic activities (N-7 methylation, 2′-O methylation, and GMP-enzyme complex formation) were detected for the SAM-depleted and SAM-containing recombinant proteins. These results clearly indicate that the SAM molecule is not an essential component for the correct folding of DENV methyltransferase. Furthermore, the results imply a potential antiviral approach to search for inhibitors that can bind to the SAM-binding pocket and compete against SAM binding. To demonstrate this potential, we have soaked crystals of DENV methyltransferase without a bound SAM with the natural product Sinefungin and show that preformed crystals are capable of binding ligands in this pocket.","Noble, Christian G.; Li, Shi-Hua; Dong, Hongping; Chew, Sock Hui; Shi, Pei-Yong",Antiviral Res,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354214002563; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25241250/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354214002563; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2014.09.003,472

This study aims to fill this gap. METHODS: In this single-center retrospective study, medical records of hospitalized adults with confirmed Covid-19 [RT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV2] at King Saud University Medical City (KSUMC)-King Khaled University Hospital (KKUH), Riyadh, Saudi Arabia from May to July 2020 were analyzed. Clinical, radiological and serological information, as well as outcomes were recorded and analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 439 patients were included (median age 55 years; 68.3% men). The most prevalent comorbidities were vitamin D deficiency (74.7%), DM (68.3%), hypertension (42.6%) and obesity (42.2%). During hospitalization, 77 out of the 439 patients (17.5%) died. DM patients have a significantly higher death rate (20.5% versus 12.3%; p = 0.04) and lower survival time (p = 0.016) than non-DM.

Fuel cells are electrochemical converters; transforming hydrogen (or energy sources containing hydrogen) and oxygen directly into electricity and heat. The hydrogen fuel cell, invented in 1839, permits the generation of electrical energy with a high efficiency through a non-combustion, electrochemical process and, importantly, without the emission of CO2 at its point of use. Hitherto, despite numerous efforts to exploit the obvious attractions of hydrogen technologies and hydrogen fuel cells, various challenges have been encountered, some of which are reviewed here. Now, however, given the exigent need to urgently seek low-carbon paths for humankind's energy future, numerous countries are advancing the deployment of hydrogen technologies and hydrogen fuel cells not only for transport, but also as a means of the storage of excess energy from, for example, wind and solar farms. Furthermore, hydrogen is also being blended into the natural gas used in domestic heating and targeted in the decarbonisation of critical, large-scale industrial processes such as steel making. We briefly review specific examples in countries such as Japan, South Korea and the People's Republic of China, as well as selected examples from Europe and North America in the utilization of hydrogen technologies and hydrogen fuel cells.","Thomas, John Meurig; Edwards, Peter P.; Dobson, Peter J.; Owen, Gari P.",Journal of Energy Chemistry,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2095495620302448; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095495620302448; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jechem.2020.03.087; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34631197/,472
667539,Effect of COVID-19 pandemic on air quality: a study based on Air Quality Index,2021-05-25,"INTRODUCTION: In order to identify priorities for building integrated surveillance systems that effectively model and predict human risk of zoonotic diseases, there is a need for improved understanding of the practical options for linking surveillance data of animals and humans. We conducted an analysis of the literature and characterized the linkage between animal and human health data. We discuss the findings in relation to zoonotic surveillance and the linkage of human and animal data. METHODS: The Canary Database, an online bibliographic database of animal-sentinel studies was searched and articles were classified according to four linkage categories. RESULTS: 465 studies were identified and assigned to linkage categories involving: descriptive, analytic, molecular, or no human outcomes of human and animal health. Descriptive linkage was the most common, whereby both animal and human health outcomes were presented, but without quantitative linkage between the two. Rarely, analytic linkage was utilized in which animal data was used to quantitatively predict human risk. The other two categories included molecular linkage, and no human outcomes, which present health outcomes in animals but not humans. DISCUSSION: We found limited use of animal data to quantitatively predict human risk and listed the methods from the literature that performed analytic linkage. The lack of analytic linkage in the literature might not be solely related to technological barriers including access to electronic database, statistical software packages, and Geographical Information System (GIS). Rather, the problem might be from a lack of understanding by researchers of the importance of animal data as a 'sentinel' for human health. Researchers performing zoonotic surveillance should be aware of the value of animal-sentinel approaches for predicting human risk and consider analytic methods for linking animal and human data. Qualitative work needs to be done in order to examine researchers' decisions in linkage strategies between animal and human data.","Scotch, Matthew; Odofin, Lynda; Rabinowitz, Peter",BMC Vet Res,https://doi.org/10.1186/1746-6148-5-15; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19389228/,472

Successful development of vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 requires a comprehensive understanding of the essential proteins of the virus. The envelope (E) protein of SARS-CoV-2 assembles into a cation-selective channel that mediates virus budding, release, and host inflammation response. E blockage reduces virus pathogenicity while E deletion attenuates the virus. Here we report the 2.4 Å structure and drug-binding site of E’s transmembrane (TM) domain, determined using solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. In lipid bilayers that mimic the endoplasmic reticulum Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) membrane, ETM forms a five-helix bundle surrounding a narrow central pore. The middle of the TM segment is distorted from the ideal a-helical geometry due to three regularly spaced phenylalanine residues, which stack within each helix and between neighboring helices. These aromatic interactions, together with interhelical Val and Leu interdigitation, cause a dehydrated pore compared to the viroporins of influenza and HIV viruses. Hexamethylene amiloride and amantadine bind shallowly to polar residues at the N-terminal lumen, while acidic pH affects the C-terminal conformation. These results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 E forms a structurally robust but bipartite channel whose N- and C-terminal halves can interact with drugs, ions and other viral and host proteins semi-independently. This structure establishes the atomic basis for designing E inhibitors as antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2.","Hong, Mei; Mandala, Venkata; McKay, Matthew; Shcherbakov, Alexander; Dregni, Aurelio; Kolocouris, Antonios",Res Sq,https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-77124/v1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32995764/,472

The effectiveness of MMD in routine settings has not yet been evaluated within a causal inference framework. We analyzed data from a robust clinical data system to evaluate MMD in Haiti. METHODS: We assessed 1-year retention in care among 21,880 ART-naïve HIV-positive persons who started ART on or after January 1, 2017, up until November 1, 2018. We used an instrumental variable analysis to estimate the causal impact of MMD. This approach was used to address potential selection into specific dispensing intervals because MMD is not randomly applied to individuals. FINDINGS: We found that extending ART dispensing intervals increased the probability of retention at 12 months after ART initiation, with up to a 24·2%-point increase (95%CI: 21·9, 26·5) in the likelihood of retention with extending dispenses by 30 days for those receiving one-month dispenses. We observed statistically significant gains to retention with MMD with up to an approximately 4-month supply of ART; +5·1%-points (95%CI: 2·4,7·8). Increasing dispensing lengths for those already receiving ≥5-month supply of ART had a potentially negative effect on retention. INTERPRETATION: MMD for ART is an effective service delivery strategy that improves care retention for new ART recipients. There is a potentially negative effect of increasing prescription lengths for those new ART recipients already receiving longer ART supplies, though more research is needed to characterize this effect given medication supplies of this length are not common for newer ART recipients.","Parrish, Canada; Basu, Anirban; Fishman, Paul; Koama, Jean Baptiste; Robin, Ermane; Francois, Kesner; Honoré, Jean Guy; Van Onacker, Joëlle Deas; Puttkammer, Nancy",EClinicalMedicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eclinm.2021.101039; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34368659/,472
669050,"Crisis management in the Australian tourism industry: Preparedness, personnel and postscript",2006-07-18,"BACKGROUND: C-to-U RNA editing is prevalent in the mitochondrial and chloroplast genes in plants. The biological functions of a fraction of C-to-U editing sites are continuously discovered by case studies. However, at genome-wide level, the cis and trans determinants affecting the occurrence or editing levels of these C-to-U events are relatively less studied. What is known is that the PPR (pentatricopeptide repeat) proteins are the main trans-regulatory elements responsible for the C-to-U conversion, but other determinants especially the cis-regulatory elements remain largely uninvestigated. RESULTS: By analyzing the transcriptome and translatome data in Arabidopsis thaliana roots and shoots, combined with RNA-seq data from hybrids of Arabidopsis thaliana and Arabidopsis lyrata, we perform genome-wide investigation on the cis elements and trans-regulatory elements that potentially affect C-to-U editing events. An upstream guanosine or double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) regions are unfavorable for editing events. Meanwhile, many genes including the transcription factors may indirectly play regulatory roles in trans. CONCLUSIONS: The 5-prime thymidine facilitates editing and dsRNA structures prevent editing in cis. Many transcription factors affect editing in trans. Although the detailed molecular mechanisms underlying the cis and trans regulation remain to be experimentally verified, our findings provide novel aspects in studying the botanical C-to-U RNA editing events.","Chu, Duan; Wei, Lai",BMC Genet,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12863-020-00907-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32883207/,472

DNA vaccines can be utilized for simultaneous immunizations against multiple pathogens and are relatively easy to design and inexpensive to manufacture and store. Administration of DNA vaccines has been shown to stimulate immune responses and provide protection from challenges in different animal models. Although DNA vaccines offer advantages, setbacks including the inability to induce strong immunity, and the fact that they are not currently applicable for mass vaccination impede the use of DNA vaccines in the poultry industry. The use of either biological or physical carriers has been proposed as a solution to overcome the current delivery limitations of DNA vaccines for veterinary applications.

This report describes findings from experimental infection of inbred Lewis rats with Seoul virus strain 80–39. Rats inoculated with virus intraperitoneally at 6 days of age became persistently infected without clinical signs. Tissues from Seoul virus-inoculated 6-day-old rats were assessed at 6, 9, and 12 weeks post-inoculation for viral RNA by RT-PCR and in situ hybridization (ISH) and for infectious virus by inoculation of Vero E6 cells. Virus was isolated from lung and kidney of infected rats at 6 weeks and viral RNA was detected in lung, kidney, pancreas, salivary gland, brain, spleen, liver and skin at 6, 9 and 12 weeks. Rats inoculated with Seoul virus intraperitoneally at 10 or 21 days of age became infected without clinical signs but had low to undetectable levels of viral RNA in tissues at 6 weeks post-inoculation. ISH identified vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells as common sites of persistent infection. Cultured rat smooth muscle cells and to a lesser extent cultured endothelial cells also were susceptible to Seoul virus infection. Pancreatic infection resulted in insulitis with associated hyperglycemia. These studies demonstrate that infant Lewis rats are uniformly susceptible to asymptomatic persistent Seoul virus infection. Additionally, they offer opportunities for correlative in vivo and in vitro study of Seoul virus interactions in host cell types that support persistent infection.","Compton, S. R.; Jacoby, R.

Spain has had one of the highest burdens of COVID-19 worldwide. During this period, Vall d’Hebron University Hospital Burn Center (Barcelona) has faced a unique challenge: supporting the hospital response against COVID whilst continued offering an optimal care to the burn patient. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to characterize the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of acute burn patients who received urgent health care or admission to the our Burn Center during the mandatory confinement period in Spain forced by the COVID-19 epidemic. METHODS: We analyzed the medical records of burn patients who received urgent care and/or admission to our Burn Center during the mandatory confinement period in Spain (Period 1: from March 14th to May 9th, 2020) and during the same period of the last year (Period 2: from March 14th to May 9th, 2019). Both groups were compared in order to find differences in the epidemiologic profile of burned patients. RESULTS: A total of 350 burns cases were analyzed. A 36% reduction in the number of emergency department visits was identified during Period 1. However, we found an increase in the rate of hospital admissions in Period 1 (20% of the burn cases) compared with Period 2 (13% of the burn cases). Seventy-six burn-related primary admissions were analyzed: 37 patients were admitted during Period 1 and 39 patients during Period 2. No differences were found between the two periods in the proportion of patients that underwent surgical treatment: 59.5% of patients admitted during Period 1 and 61.5% of patients admitted during Period 2. A statistically significant increase was noted in the rate of paediatric (aged 0–16 years old) admissions during Period 1 (40.54%, n = 15) compared to Period 2 (20.5%, n = 8). Among paediatric patients, an increase in the rate of surgical procedures was noted in Period 1 (47% of children), compared with Period 2 (37% of children). Proportion of patients that were admitted to the Intensive Care Unit was higher among burn children admitted during period 1 (46.7%, n = 7) than those admitted during Period 2 (25%, n = 2). Among the 37 patients admitted during the lockdown period, two positive COVID-19 patients were confirmed. CONCLUSIONS: This study gives an overview of the clinical and epidemiologic profile of burned patients during the stringent lockdown in Spain forced by the COVID-19 epidemic. Our data shows a stable trend in the number of burn-related admissions and burn related-surgeries during the confinement period. A significant increase in the rate of burn children admitted and an increase in the severity of injuries in this population is noted. These data must be taken in account in the development of strategies to ensure the maintenance of Burn Centers function in extremely situations such as the current epidemic. A lack of effective burn prevention campaigns in our environment has been noted and the development of focused prevention strategies is a priority.","Monte-Soldado, Alejandra; López-Masramon, Bernat; Rivas-Nicolls, Danilo; Andrés-Collado, Aranzazu; Aguilera-Sáez, Jorge; Serracanta, Jordi; Barret, Juan P.",Burns,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305417921000760; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0305417921000760; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.burns.2021.03.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33858713/,472

676061,University Virtual Learning in Covid Times,2021-07-20,"BACKGROUND: Patient-centered outcomes research (PCOR) engages patients as partners in research and focuses on questions and outcomes that are important to patients. The COVID-19 pandemic has forced PCOR teams to engage through web-based platforms rather than in person. Similarly, virtual engagement is the only safe alternative for members of the cystic fibrosis (CF) community, who spend their lives following strict infection control guidelines and are already restricted from in-person interactions. In the absence of universal best practices, the CF community has developed its own guidelines to help PCOR teams engage through web-based platforms. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify the important attributes, facilitators, and barriers to teams when selecting web-based platforms. METHODS: We conducted semistructured interviews with CF community members, nonprofit stakeholders, and researchers to obtain information regarding their experience with using web-based platforms, including the effectiveness and efficiency of these platforms and their satisfaction with and confidence while using each platform. Interviews conducted via Zoom were audio recorded and transcribed. We identified key themes through content analysis with an iterative, inductive, and deductive coding process. RESULTS: In total, 15 participants reported using web-based platforms for meetings, project management, document sharing, scheduling, and communication. When selecting web-based platforms, participants valued their accessibility, ease of use, and integration with other platforms. Participants speculated that successful web-based collaboration involved platforms that emulate in-person interactions, recognized the digital literacy levels of the team members, intentionally aligned platforms with collaboration goals, and achieved team member buy-in to adopt new platforms. CONCLUSIONS: Successful web-based engagement in PCOR requires the use of multiple platforms in order to fully meet the asynchronous or synchronous goals of the project. This study identified the key attributes for the successful practice of PCOR on web-based platforms and the common challenges and solutions associated with their use. Our findings provide the best practices for selecting platforms and the lessons learned through web-based PCOR collaborations.","Thayer, Erin K; Pam, Molly; Al Achkar, Morhaf; Mentch, Laura; Brown, Georgia; Kazmerski, Traci M; Godfrey, Emily",J Particip Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33646964/; https://doi.org/10.2196/24966,472

With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we sought to develop an online referral pathway that would allow us to provide definitive orthopaedic management plans and reduce face-to-face contact at the fracture clinics. METHODS: All patients presenting to the emergency department from 21March 2020 with a musculoskeletal injury or potential musculoskeletal infection deemed to require orthopaedic input were discussed using a secure messaging app. A definitive management plan was communicated by an on-call senior orthopaedic decision-maker. We analyzed the time to decision, if further information was needed, and the referral outcome. An analysis of the orthopaedic referrals for the same period in 2019 was also performed as a comparison. RESULTS: During the study period, 295 patients with mean age of 7.93 years (standard error (SE) 0.24) were reviewed. Of these, 25 (9.8%) were admitted, 17 (5.8%) were advised to return for planned surgical intervention, 105 (35.6%) were referred to a face-to-face fracture clinic, 137 (46.4%) were discharged with no follow-up, and seven (2.4%) were referred to other services. The mean time to decision was 20.14 minutes (SE 1.73). There was a significant difference in the time to decision between patients referred to fracture clinic and patients discharged (mean 25.25 minutes (SE 3.18) vs mean 2.63 (SE 1.42); p < 0.005).

The “innovation paradox” , wherein excellent ideas and good science fail to reach the bedside, is a major challenge. This study presents the Active Compass model as a way to overcome this obstacle. The model is designed to assist projects at early stages by redirecting and reshaping them in a way that increases their chances of reaching the markets. The model is based on the use of next-generation translational research and on creating differentiators at the early stages of development. The proposed model’s implementation by innovators, scientists, technology transfer offices, academic institutions, analysts, and investors can help move forward high-potential projects to improve the quality of life and alleviate the burdens of disease.","Ilan, Yaron",J Transl Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33541380/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12967-021-02726-4,472

685445,"Sustainable economic activities, climate change, and carbon risk: an international evidence",2021-09-27,"SARS-CoV-2 infection have caused global pandemic and claimed over 5,000,000 tolls1–4. Although the genetic sequences of their etiologic viruses are of high homology, the clinical and pathological characteristics of COVID-19 significantly differ from SARS5,6. Especially, it seems that SARS-CoV-2 undergoes vast replication in vivo without being effectively monitored by anti-viral immunity7. Here, we show that the viral protein encoded from open reading frame 8 (ORF8) of SARS-CoV-2, which shares the least homology with SARS-CoV among all the viral proteins, can directly interact with MHC-I molecules and significantly down-regulates their surface expression on various cell types. In contrast, ORF8a and ORF8b of SARS-CoV do not exert this function. In the ORF8-expressing cells, MHC-I molecules are selectively target for lysosomal degradation by an autophagy-dependent mechanism. As a result, CTLs inefficiently eliminate the ORF8-expressing cells. Our results demonstrate that ORF8 protein disrupts antigen presentation and reduces the recognition and the elimination of virus-infected cells by CTLs8. Therefore, we suggest that the inhibition of ORF8 function could be a strategy to improve the special immune surveillance and accelerate the eradication of SARS-CoV-2 in vivo.","Zhang, Yiwen; Zhang, Junsong; Chen, Yingshi; Luo, Baohong; Yuan, Yaochang; Huang, Feng; Yang, Tao; Yu, Fei; Liu, Jun; Liu, Bingfen; Song, Zheng; Chen, Jingliang; Pan, Ting; Zhang, Xu; Li, Yuzhuang; Li, Rong; Huang, Wenjing; Xiao, Fei; Zhang, Hui",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.24.111823,472

687201,Towards Societies Living with COVID-19,2021-02-12,"Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a large group of enveloped viruses with a single-strand RNA genome, which continuously circulate in mammals and birds and pose a threat to livestock, companion animals, and humans. CoVs harboured by avian species are classified to the genera gamma- and deltacoronaviruses. Within the gamma-CoVs the main representative is avian coronavirus, a taxonomic name which includes the highly contagious infectious bronchitis viruses (IBVs) in chickens and similar viruses infecting other domestic birds such as turkeys, guinea fowls, or quails. Additionally, IBVs have been detected in healthy wild birds, demonstrating that they may act as the vector between domestic and free-living birds. Moreover, CoVs other than IBVs, are identified in wild birds, which suggests that wild birds play a key role in the epidemiology of other gammaCoVs and deltaCoVs. Development of molecular techniques has significantly improved knowledge of the prevalence of CoVs in avian species. The methods adopted in monitoring studies of CoVs in different avian species are mainly based on detection of conservative regions within the viral replicase, nucleocapsid genes, and 3’UTR or 5’UTR. The purpose of this review is to summarise recent discoveries in the areas of epidemiology and diagnosis of CoVs in avian species and to understand the role of wild birds in the virus distribution.","Miłek, Justyna; Blicharz-Domańska, Katarzyna",J Vet Res,https://doi.org/10.2478/jvetres-2018-0035; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30584600/,472

689798,A conceptual framework of the service delivery system design for hospitality firms in the (post-)viral world: The role of service robots,2020-09-15,"COVID-19 is a novel infectious disease which has rapidly spread around the globe, disrupting several aspects of public life over the past year. After numerous infection clusters emerged among travelers hosted in ski resorts in early 2020, several European countries closed ski areas. These measures were mostly upheld throughout the 2020 and 2021 winter season, generating significant economic loss for mountain communities. The aim of this rapid systematic review was to explore the association between recreational skiing and the spread of COVID-19. This review was conducted according to the WHO practical guidelines on rapid reviews and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. PubMed, Scopus, MedRxiv and Promed-mail were screened to identify relevant scientific and grey literature published since the emergence of COVID-19. Among the 11 articles included, seven focused on cases recorded during the first epidemic wave, when COVID-19 containment measures were not yet mandatory. Most infection clusters could be directly linked to public gatherings which took place without the enforcement of restrictions. There is currently no evidence to suggest an association between COVID-19 spread and recreational skiing. It may be reasonable to consider the reopening of ski areas in compliance with strict rules and preventive measures.","Gianfredi, Vincenza; Mauer, Nicole Sibilla; Gentile, Leandro; Riccò, Matteo; Odone, Anna; Signorelli, Carlo",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18084349; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33923960/,472
690616,Post-Pandemic Recovery: The Russian Economy and the Transition to Sustainable Social and Economic Development,2020-11-06,"ATTR amyloidosis is caused by systemic deposition of transthyretin (TTR) and comprises ATTRwt (wt for wild-type) amyloidosis, ATTRv (v for variant) amyloidosis, and acquired ATTR amyloidosis after domino liver transplantation. ATTRwt amyloidosis has classically been regarded as cardiomyopathy found in the elderly, whereas carpal tunnel syndrome has also become a major initial manifestation. The phenotypes of ATTRv amyloidosis are diverse and include neuropathy, cardiomyopathy, and oculoleptomeningeal involvement as the predominant features, depending on the mutation and age of onset. In addition to variant TTR, the deposition of wild-type TTR plays a significant role, even in patients with ATTRv amyloidosis. The formation of amyloid fibrils tends to occur in association with the basement membrane. The thickening or reduplication of the basement membrane surrounding endoneurial microvessels, which is similar to diabetic neuropathy, is observed in ATTRv amyloidosis, suggesting that common mechanisms, such as an accumulation of advanced glycation end products, may participate in the disease process. In addition to direct damage caused by amyloid fibrils, recent studies have suggested that the toxicity of nonfibrillar TTRs, such as TTR oligomers, participates in the process of tissue damage. Although liver transplantation has been performed for patients with ATTRv amyloidosis since 1990, late-onset patients were not eligible for this treatment. However, as the efficacy of orally administered tafamidis and diflunisal, which stabilize TTR tetramers, was suggested in the early 2010s, such late-onset patients have also become targets for disease-modifying therapies. Additionally, recent studies of small interfering RNA (patisiran) and antisense oligonucleotide (inotersen) therapies have demonstrated the efficacy of these gene-silencing agents. A strategy for monitoring patients that enables the choice of an appropriate treatment from comprehensive and long-term viewpoints should be established. As many patients with ATTR amyloidosis are aged and have heart failure, they are at increased risk of aggravation if they are infected by SARS-CoV2. The optimal interval of evaluation should also be considered, particularly in this COVID-19 era.","Koike, Haruki; Katsuno, Masahisa",Neurol Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32983832/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s40120-020-00210-7,472
