2753,Vaccinations against respiratory infections in Arabian Gulf countries: Barriers and motivators,2017-06-16,"AIM: To study the uptake, barriers and motivators of influenza, pneumococcal, meningococcal and pertussis vaccines among members of public in Arabian Gulf countries. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey among the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries’ residents. Data collected electronically through a smartphone app. The survey variables aimed to investigate the respondents’ awareness about vaccines against influenza, pneumococcal, meningococcal and pertussis infections. Collected data concerning the respondents’ socio-demographic characteristics, their perception toward vaccine uptake and the factors that motivate or demotivate them from taking influenza vaccine. The data were analysed statistically using the SPSS v.23.0. Differences in the characteristics of users from different countries were quantified through bivariate analysis. Other important variables and controlling factors were studied using logistic regression. RESULTS: A total of 1812 respondents participated in the study. Their mean age was 27 years, 82% were male and 24% had ≥ 1 chronic diseases. The overall uptake of influenza vaccine was 17% (21% among “at risk” people) and ranged from 15% in Saudi Arabia to 24% in Qatar. Doctor’s advice (23%) and a perception of having low body immunity (21%) were the main cited reasons for being vaccinated, whereas unawareness about the vaccine (43%) was the main barrier. The overall uptake of pneumococcal vaccine in the preceding three years was 22% (25% among “at risk” individuals) and ranged from 0% in Bahrain to 79% in Kuwait. The overall uptake of pertussis vaccine was 16% (31% among “vulnerable” people), and ranged from 7% in Saudi Arabia to 75% in Oman. The overall uptake of meningococcal vaccine was 20% (29% among the “at risk” people) and ranged from 3% in Oman to 50% in Bahrain. CONCLUSION: The vaccination uptake across GCC countries is suboptimal and varies widely across the countries. Further research is needed to unearth the reasons and formulate action plan.","Alqahtani, Amani S; Bondagji, Daniah M; Alshehari, Abdullah A; Basyouni, Mada H; Alhawassi, Tariq M; BinDhim, Nasser F; Rashid, Harunor",World J Clin Cases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5480069/,466
5152,Infections gastro-intestinales chez le patient immunocompromis,2002,"We have examined the influence of genotype at the relA locus on the kinetics of leftward (or –1) frameshifting at a variety of codons calling for a limiting aminoacyl-tRNA species. We used lacZ left-frameshift reporter constructs carrying the sequence U UUC xyz, where xyz was each of three triplets coding for three different amino acids; we slowed the ribosomes at each of these by limiting for the amino acid or for the aminoacyl-tRNA. In all cases, limitation stimulated leftward frameshifting. In all cases, the stimulation was greater in relA mutant cells than in their wild-type relA (+) counterparts. In the latter genotype, the increased frameshifting was constant from the start of the limitation regime. This was also true of the relA mutant strain during limitation for lysine-tRNA or for leucine; however, during limitation for isoleucine-tRNA (or for isoleucine) the mutant showed a gradual, progressive increase in frameshifting, suggesting an indirect effect. We suggest that gradual accumulation of undermodified tRNAs, which is characteristic of the relA response, is involved. However, the specific modification involved is unknown. It is not queosine: analysis of a tgt mutant that is completely defective in queosine modification showed no increase in leftward frameshifting on the reporter which showed the larger, gradual increase during the relA response to isoleucine-tRNA limitation.","Masucci, J.; Gallant, J.; Lindsley, D.; Atkinson, J.",Mol Genet Genomics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7087913/,466
7714,Asthme du nourrisson : monopole du virus respiratoire syncytial ?,2006-05-11,"BACKGROUND: The public health response to Zika outbreak has mostly focused on epidemiological surveillance, vector control, and individual level preventative measures. This qualitative study employs a social-ecological framework to examine how macro (historical, legislative, political, socio-economic factors), meso (sources of information, social support, social mobilization) and micro level factors (individual actions, behavioral changes) interacted to influence the response and behavior of women with respect to Zika in different contexts. METHODS: A qualitative study was carried out. Women were recruited through the snowball sampling technique from various locations in Brazil, Puerto Rico, and the United States. They were of different nationalities and ethnicities. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews. The data transcripts were analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Women in this study deemed the information provided as insufficient, which led them to actively reach out and access a variety of media sources. Social networks played a vital role in sharing information but also resulted in the spread of hoaxes or rumors. Participants in our research perceived socio-economic inequities but focused on how to remedy their microenvironments. They did not engage in major social activities. Lack of trust in governments placed women in vulnerable situations by preventing them to follow the guidance of health authorities. These impacts were also a result of the response tactics of health and government administrations in their failed attempts to ensure the well-being of their countries’ populations. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings call for public health interventions that go beyond individual level behavioral change campaigns, to more comprehensively address the broader meso and macro level factors that influence women’ willingness and possibility to protect themselves.","Linde-Arias, Ana Rosa; Roura, Maria; Siqueira, Eduardo",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7118940/,466
8702,Syndrome respiratoire aigu sévère : à propos d'un cas de transmission indirecte du Coronavirus,2004-06-04,"This chapter discusses the various aspects of the clinical virology of rhinoviruses. Some attributes of the virus and epidemiology of disease that have clinical relevance, the efficiency of methods for detecting the presence of the virus in the human respiratory tract, and the means by which symptomatic illness is produced by rhinovirus infection of the respiratory tract are described Rhinoviruses cause more infections in humans than any other microorganism. The chapter also discusses the attributes of virus and the epidemiology of disease. These acid-sensitive picornaviruses infect epithelial cells following inoculation onto the nasal mucosa and are detected reliably in nasopharyngeal secretions. Rhinovirus colds occur year round, with a peak of illness in the fall. Type-specific serum antibody correlates with protection against infection. The fact that there are at least 100 different immunotypes makes development of an effective vaccine unlikely. The chapter presents various techniques for the detection of rhinovirus, such as sampling and cell culture, and polymerase chain reaction.","Hendley, J.

24670,1 Inleiding,2016-08-26,"The current status and challenges of RNA interference (RNAi) and microRNA modulation strategies for the treatment of myocardial disorders are discussed and related to the classical gene therapeutic approaches of the past decade. Section 2 summarizes the key issues of current vector technologies which determine if they may be suitable for clinical translation of experimental RNAi or microRNA therapeutic protocols. We then present and discuss examples dealing with the potential of cardiac RNAi therapy. First, an approach to block a key early step in the pathogenesis of a virus-induced cardiomyopathy by RNAi targeting of a cellular receptor for cardiopathogenic viruses (Section 3). Second, an approach to improve cardiac function by RNAi targeting of late pathway of heart failure pathogenesis common to myocardial disorders of multiple etiologies. This strategy is directed at myocardial Ca(2+) homeostasis which is disturbed in heart failure due to coronary heart disease, heart valve dysfunction, cardiac inflammation, or genetic defects (Section 4). Whereas the first type of strategies (directed at early pathogenesis) need to be tailor-made for each different type of pathomechanism, the second type (targeting late common pathways) has a much broader range of application. This advantage of the second type of approaches is of key importance since enormous efforts need to be undertaken before any regulatory RNA therapy enters the stage of possible clinical translation. If then the number of patients eligible for this protocol is large, the actual transformation of the experimental therapy into a new therapeutic option of clinical importance is far more likely to occur.","Poller, W.; Suckau, L.; Pinkert, S.; Fechner, H.",RNA Technologies in Cardiovascular Medicine and Research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121055/,466

Our ‘RLZ’ approach is to store a self-index for a base sequence and then compress every other sequence as an LZ77 encoding relative to the base. For a collection of r sequences totaling N bases, with a total of s point mutations from a base sequence of length n, this representation requires just [Formula: see text] bits. At the cost of negligible extra space, access to ℓ consecutive symbols requires [Formula: see text] time. Our experiments show that, for example, RLZ can represent individual human genomes in around 0.1 bits per base while supporting rapid access and using relatively little memory.","Kuruppu, Shanika; Puglisi, Simon J.; Zobel, Justin",String Processing and Information Retrieval,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121420/,466

25645,Openbare gezondheid en preventie,2016,"Chronic inflammatory diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease—namely, Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis—psoriasis, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and many others affect millions of people worldwide, causing a high burden of disease, socioeconomic impact, and healthcare cost. These diseases have common features including autoimmune pathogenesis and frequent co morbidity. The treatment of these chronic inflammatory diseases usually requires long-term immunosuppressive therapies with undesirable side effects. The future of chronic inflammatory disease prevention, detection, and treatment will be greatly influenced by the use of more effective biomarkers with enhanced performance. Given the practical issues of collecting tissue samples in inflammatory diseases, biomarkers derived from body fluids have great potential for optimized patient management through the circumvention of the abovementioned limitations. In this chapter, peripheral blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers used in chronic inflammatory conditions are reviewed. In detail, this chapter reviews biomarkers to fore used or emerging to be used in patients with chronic inflammatory conditions. Those include inflammatory bowel diseases, chronic inflammatory conditions of the liver, biliary tract, pancreas, psoriasis, atopic disease, inflammatory skin diseases, rheumatic diseases, demyelination, and also the chronic inflammatory component of various other diseases in general medicine—including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, renal disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Development of personalized medicine is closely linked to biomarkers, which may serve as the basis for diagnosis, drug discovery, and monitoring of diseases.","Katsanos, Aristeidis H.; Kyriakidi, Kalliroi; Karassa, Fotini B.; Politis, Dimitrios; Skamnelos, Alexandros; Christodoulou, Dimitrios K.; Katsanos, Konstantinos H.",Biomarkers for Endometriosis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122305/,466

28119,34 Intérêt du voriconazole dans les infections fungiques respiratoires de patients non aplasiques,2008-01-03,"Corporate governance has been severely condemned, as a result of company failures around the world. Regulatory and legislative measure have been introduced in response to these failures. However, arguments by sceptics advocate that it is time consuming and costly to comply these legislative measures that cause overregulation. These measures further do not always add value to business initiatives and adherence to these measures cannot be enforced or guaranteed. This paper argues for the use of business process management systems (BPMSs) to improve corporate governance. The “dynamics capabilities theory model of IT-enabled organisational performance” [1] is applied in this study as theoretical underpinning. A theoretical framework is proposed for IT-enabled and IT-enforced corporate governance compliance using a BPMS, after collecting data from seven BPMS user companies and a BPMS vendor company in South Africa.","Pretorius, Hendrik Willem; van der Merwe, Alta","Responsible Design, Implementation and Use of Information and Communication Technology",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134248/,466

There exist different methods for solving inverse problems, including gradient based methods, statistics based methods, and Deep Learning (DL) methods. In this work, we focus on the latest. Specifically, we study the design of proper loss functions for dealing with inverse problems using DL. To do this, we introduce a simple benchmark problem with known analytical solution. Then, we propose multiple loss functions and compare their performance when applied to our benchmark example problem. In addition, we analyze how to improve the approximation of the forward function by: (a) considering a Hermite-type interpolation loss function, and (b) reducing the number of samples for the forward training in the Encoder-Decoder method. Results indicate that a correct design of the loss function is crucial to obtain accurate inversion results.","Rivera, Jon Ander; Pardo, David; Alberdi, Elisabete",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7304019/,466

51736,The COVID-19 Vaccine in Clinical Trials: Where Are We Now?,2021-04-20,"BACKGROUND: Some COVID-19 patients with similar quantitative CT measurements had variable clinical presentation and outcome. The absence of reasonable clinical explanations, such as pre-existing comorbidities or vascular complications, adds to the confusion. The authors believed that neglecting the impact of certain severe morphologic features could be an alternative radiological explanation. This study aims to optimize the initial CT staging of COVID-19 and propose a new combined morphologic/volumetric CT severity index (CTSI) to solve this clinico-radiological mismatch. RESULTS: This multi-center study included two major steps. The first step of the study entailed a standardized combined morphologic/volumetric CT severity analyses to propose a new optimized CTSI. This was conducted retrospectively during the period from June till September 2020. It included 379 acutely symptomatic COVID-19 patients. They were clinically classified according to their oxygen saturation and respiratory therapeutic requirements into three groups: group A (mild 298/79%), group B (borderline severity 57/15%), and group C (severe/critical 24/6%). The morphologic and volumetric assessment of their HRCT was analyzed according to severity, by two consultant radiologists in consensus. A new 25 point-CTSI has been created, combining eight morphological CT patterns [M1:M8; 8 points] and four grades of volumetric scores [S1:S4; 17 points]. The addition of the M5 pattern (air bubble sign), M6 pattern (early fibrosis and architectural distortion), or M7 pattern (crazy-paving) proved to increase the clinical severity. The second step of the study entailed a standardized blinded/independent validation analysis for the proposed CTSI. This was prospectively conducted on other 132 patients during October 2020 and independently performed by other two consultant radiologists. Validation results reached 80.2% sensitivity, 91.8% specificity, AUROC-curve = 0.8356, and 90.9% accuracy. CONCLUSION: A new optimized CTSI with accepted validation is proposed for initial staging of COVID-19 patients, using combined morphologic/volumetric assessment instead of the quantitative assessment alone. It could solve the clinico-radiological mismatch among patients with similar quantitative CT results and variable clinical presentation during the absence of pre-existing comorbidities or vascular complications.","Samir, Ahmed; Elnekeidy, Abdelaziz; Gharraf, Heba Said; Baess, Ayman Ibrahim; El-Diasty, Tarek; Altarawy, Dina",Egypt J Radiol Nucl Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8048330/,466

Here, such a low-cost (∼$1/mask) mask design having electrostatic rechargeability and filtration efficiency of >95% with a quality factor of ∼20 kPa(−1) is demonstrated. This filtration efficacy is for particles of size 300 nm. The tri-layer mask, named PPDFGO tri, contains nylon, modified polypropylene (PPY), and cotton nonwoven fabrics as three layers. The melt-spun PPY, available in a conventional N95 mask, modified with graphene oxide and polyvinylidene fluoride mixture containing paste using a simple solution casting method acts as active filtration layer. The efficacy of this tri-layer system toward triboelectric rechargeability using small mechanical agitations is demonstrated here. These triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG)-assisted membranes have high electrostatic charge retention capacity (∼1 nC/cm(2) after 5 days in ambient condition) and high rechargeability even in very humid conditions (>80% RH). A simple but robust permeability measurement set up is also constructed to test these TENG-based membranes, where a flow rate of 30–35 L/min is maintained during the testing. Such a simple modification to the existing mask designs enabling their rechargeability via external mechanical disturbances, with enhanced usability for single use as well as for reuse with decontantamination, will be highly beneficial in the realm of indispensable personal protective equipment.","Figerez, Stelbin Peter; Patra, Sudeshna; Rajalakshmi, G; Narayanan, Tharangattu N",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8108635/,466
54086,Educational Futures and Postdigital Science,2021-06-10,"The liver is an important metabolic organ, and acute liver injury (ALI) is potentially lethal. Itaconate, a metabolic intermediate from the tricarboxylic acid cycle, showed emerging anti-oxidative and anti-inflammation properties, and an accumulating protective effect in multiple diseases, but its role in ALI still needs to be further explored. Here we established an ALI model induced by carbon tetrachloride in mice. Our results showed that 4-Octyl itaconate (OI), a derivate of itaconate, mitigated hepatic damage by improving liver function, reducing histopathological damage, and decreasing the death of hepatocytes. Additionally, OI decreased myeloperoxidase and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) levels in the ALI model. OI also inhibited the inflammatory response by reducing pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion (IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β, and MCP-1) and infiltration of macrophages and neutrophils in the ALI model. However, administration of ML385, a specified Nrf2 inhibitor, eliminated the protective properties of OI in the CCl4-induced liver injury model by increasing hepatic damage and oxidative stress. Furthermore, OI increased the expression and nuclear translocation of Nrf2 and elevated the expression of heme oxygenase-1 and NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1, while knockdown of Nrf2 eliminated these effects in murine hepatocyte NCTC 1469 under CCl4 treatment. Moreover, we found that OI reduced serum High-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) levels in CCl4-treated mice. Finally, OI inhibited nuclear translocation of factor-kappa B (NF-𝜅B) and inflammatory cytokine production in murine macrophages. In conclusion, these results indicated that OI ameliorated CCl4-induced ALI by mitigating oxidative stress and the inflammatory response. The possible mechanism was associated with the elevation of Nrf2 nuclear translocation and inhibition of HMGB1 mediated the nuclear translocation of NF-𝜅B.","Li, Ruidong; Yang, Wenchang; Yin, Yuping; Ma, Xianxiong; Zhang, Peng; Tao, Kaixiong",Front Pharmacol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8185275/,466
62031,"Social Solidarity in Health Care, American-Style.",2020-09-01,"Background Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is effective for recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), but inconsistent effect rates and uncertain evidence levels have warranted caution. To clarify, we aimed to establish the evidence of FMT for recurrent CDI, updated across different delivery methods, treatment regimens, and in comparison with standard antibiotics. Methods In this updated systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, Clinical Key, and Svemed+ for FMT literature published in English until November 11, 2019. We included observational and clinical trials with or without antibiotic comparators and excluded studies with below 8 weeks follow-up and fewer than 15 patients. The primary outcome was clinical outcome by week 8. We comprehensively extracted patient and procedural data. In a random-effects meta-analysis, we estimated the clinical effect for repeat or single FMT, different delivery methods, and versus antibiotics. We rated the evidence according to the Cochrane and GRADE methods. The PROSPERO preregistration number is CRD42020158112. Findings Of 1816 studies assessed, 45 studies were included. The overall clinical effect week 8 following repeat FMT (24 studies, 1855 patients) was 91% (95% CI: 89-94%, I 2=53%) and 84% (80-88%, I 2=86%) following single FMT (43 studies, 2937 patients). Delivery by lower gastrointestinal endoscopy was superior to all other delivery methods, and repeat FMT significantly increased the treatment effect week 8 (P<0·001). Compared with vancomycin, the number needed to treat (NNT) for repeat FMT was 1·5 (1·3-1·9, P<0·001) and 2.9 (1·5-37·1, P=0·03) for single FMT. Repeat FMT had high quality of evidence. Interpretation High-quality evidence supports FMT is effective for recurrent CDI, but its effect varies with the delivery method and the number of administrations. The superior NNT for FMT compared with antibiotics suggests that patients may benefit from advancing FMT to all instances of recurrent CDI.

Our objective here was to briefly review thyroid changes due to the COVID-19 infection. Ongoing assessment of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic will reveal more information on coronavirus-induced thyroid conditions. Routine thyroid assays performed in patients with severe infection/at acute phase of COVID-19 are encouraged in order to detect thyrotoxicosis. After recovery, thyroid function should be assessed to identify potential hypothyroidism. There remain unanswered questions related to the prognostic value of interleukin-6 in infected patients, especially in cases with cytokine storm, and the necessity of thyroid hormone replacement in subjects with hypophysitis-related central hypothyroidism.","Șandru, Florica; Carsote, Mara; Petca, Răzvan Cosmin; Gheorghisan-Galateanu, Ancuta Augustina; Petca, Aida; Valea, Ana; Dumitrașcu, Mihai Cristian",Experimental and therapeutic medicine,https://doi.org/10.3892/etm.2021.10188; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34035853/,466

The knowledge gap created by this unanswered question has caused substantial debate and controversy on a global scale, leading public health organizations to feel pressured into issuing decisive recommendations despite a lack of supportive data. Changes in clinical practice caused by public health guidance during such high-profile events can be expected to establish a new standard of care. Also possible is an unforeseen gradual transition to widespread N95 respirator use, driven by public health pressures instead of science, for all outbreaks of influenza or influenza-like illness. Therefore, public health organizations and other influential institutions should take care to avoid making changes to established practice standards, if possible, unless these changes are bolstered by sound scientific evidence. Until definitive comparative effectiveness clinical trials are conducted, the answer to this question will continue to remain elusive.

80708,Global public health legal responses to H1N1.,2011,"OBJECTIVE To establish and to evaluate the effectiveness of a three-tier screening process of depressive and anxiety disorders among children and adolescents with cancer based on questionnaires (first tier), semi-structured psychiatric interviews (second tier), and referral for psychiatric assessment and recommendations for treatment (third tier). We also aimed to determine the rates of depressive and anxiety disorders among participants. METHODS Participants and their parents completed the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Depression and Anxiety modules. Then, they were interviewed separately using the semi-structured Affective and Anxiety Modules of the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children (K-SADS). PROMIS cutoff values for diagnosing depressive and anxiety disorders, based on the K-SADS, were calculated by receiver-operating characteristics (ROCs). RESULTS Of 91 participants 34 (37.4%) aged 7-21 years with cancer met the K-SADS criteria for depressive and/or anxiety disorders. The results of the ROC analyses were stronger for depressive disorders than for anxiety disorders and for more severe cases. The cutoff of 13 on the child-reported PROMIS for a major depressive episode had a sensitivity of 0.80 and a specificity of 0.82, and a cutoff of 14 on the child-reported PROMIS for generalized anxiety disorder had a sensitivity of 0.78 and a specificity of 0.79. CONCLUSIONS Using the K-SADS, we found that anxiety and depressive disorders are very common in youngsters with cancer. The three-tier screening process we developed for depression and anxiety in this population provides practical cutoff values for identifying depressive and anxiety disorders in children with cancer.

The virus outbreak has spread when there are no approved vaccines, treatments, or prophylactic therapies available. Researchers from all over the world have prioritized development of vaccines and antivirals. Several vaccine projects have seen successes in preclinical, phase I, and phase II clinical trials using recombinant DNA, mRNA, live attenuated virus, S-protein subunits, virus like particles, and viral vectors. Initial findings from antivirals such as remdesivir, favipiravir, danoprevir or lopinavir with ritonavir are presented. Immunomodulatory molecules such as sarilumab, tocilizumab, janus kinase inhibitors, and hyperimmune convalescent plasma have mixed outcomes from initial clinical findings; however, pending randomized controlled trials will assist national health institutions to make treatment recommendations for COVID-19. Where compassionate use of remdesivir has shown some benefits, therapies such as hydroxychloroquine have proven harmful due to their toxicities.

Methods The post-marketing study involved 15 sites in Japan. Dydrogesterone 10 mg twice daily orally was administered for 21 days (day 5-25 of each menstrual cycle) for 4 cycles. The primary outcome measure was the change in ovarian endometrioma volume from baseline. Secondary outcome measures included total dysmenorrhea score (0 = absent to 3 = severe), severity of dysmenorrhea pain [0-10cm visual analog scale (VAS)], serum carbohydrate antigen 125 (CA-125) levels, and safety. Results The study group comprised women with an endometrioma aged 20 to 49 (47.4% cases aged ≥40 years). Endometrioma volume was reduced in 50% (26/52), unchanged in 25% (13/52), and increased in 25% (13/52) of women from baseline to the end of cycle 5; three-quarters of patients thus had either reduced or unchanged ovarian endometrioma volume. Dydrogesterone significantly reduced total dysmenorrhea scores and severity of dysmenorrhea pain VAS during treatment compared with baseline. CA-125 levels were not significantly changed during the study. The incidence of adverse events and adverse drug reactions in 59 subjects was 13.6% and 11.9%. Conclusions Dydrogesterone prevented an increase in endometrioma size in many women, and it also significantly improved total dysmenorrhea scores and severity of dysmenorrhea pain, and was well tolerated.

92626,The Coronavirus Pandemic: Public Health and American Values.,2020-06-01,"PURPOSE Although laparoscopic appendectomy is one of the most commonly performed operations, operation procedures vary widely according to the surgeon. In particular, various methods using different instruments have been used for mesoappendix dissection, such as endostapler, endoclip (EC), Harmonic(®) (Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Cincinnati, OH) scalpel (HS), electrocautery, and LigaSure™ (Covidien, Mansfield, MA). Here we compared the results of mesoappendix dissection by EC, HS, and monopolar electrocautery (ME). SUBJECTS AND METHODS The study was performed on 1178 patients who received laparoscopic appendectomy at the Armed Forces Capital Hospital, Seongnam, Korea, from January 2003 to April 2013. Patients receiving mesoappendix dissection involving EC, HS, or ME were enrolled. Patient demographics, pathology of appendix, and perioperative data including operation time, hospital stay, and complications were analyzed. A theoretical model of disposable cost was constructed for each method to compare cost-effectiveness. RESULTS The average operation time for the 1178 patients was 58.0±24.9 minutes for the EC group, 51.4±25.5 minutes for the HS group, and 57.7±25.7 minutes for the ME group. The time for the HS group was significantly shorter. Hospital stay and complication rates did not differ. Disposable costs were 620,350 South Korean won (KRW) (571 U.S. dollars) for the EC group, 1,041,230 KRW (959 U.S. dollars) for the HS group, and 491,230 KRW (452 U.S. dollars) for the ME group. CONCLUSIONS The operation time of ME was similar to that of EC. Although HS had a significantly shorter operation time, the operation time of all three methods was under 60 minutes. All three methods had acceptable complication rates. ME was the most cost-effective method and, given the other similarities, can be recommended for mesoappendix dissection in laparoscopic appendectomy.","Lee, Jun Suh; Hong, Tae Ho",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

The authors examined re-treatment rates after treatment with PED alone versus PED and adjunctive coil embolization (PED/coil). METHODS The authors retrospectively examined cerebral aneurysms treated with the PED from May 2011 to March 2014. Overall, 133 patients (25 men, 108 women; mean age 60.4 years, range 23-85 years) were treated for 140 aneurysms (mean size 11.8 ± 8.3 mm) requiring 224 PEDs (mean 1.7 PEDs per patient). Sixty-eight patients (13 men, 55 women) were treated with PED alone for 73 aneurysms (mean size 10.6 ± 9.2 mm) and 65 patients (12 men, 53 women) were treated with PED/coil for 67 aneurysms (mean size 12.8 ± 7.4 mm). RESULTS Eight aneurysms in 8 patients were re-treated in the PED-alone cohort versus only 1 aneurysm in 1 patient in the PED/coil cohort for re-treatment rates of 11.8% (8/68) and 1.5% (1/65), respectively (p = 0.03). Two patients in the PED-alone cohort were re-treated due to PED contraction, while the other 6 were re-treated for persistent filling of the aneurysms. The PED/coil patient experienced continued filling of a vertebrobasilar artery aneurysm. No aneurysms in either group ruptured after treatment. CONCLUSIONS Adjunctive coil embolization during flow diversion with the PED resulted in a significantly lower re-treatment rate compared with PED alone, suggesting an added benefit with adjunctive coil embolization. This result may provide the basis for future evaluation with randomized, controlled trials.","Park, Min S; Nanaszko, Michael; Sanborn, Matthew R; Moon, Karam; Albuquerque, Felipe C; McDougall, Cameron G",Journal of neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.3171/2015.7.jns15582; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26684772/,466

It started in the 1950s when Luis Izquierdo challenged the traditional descriptive perspective of embryology and comparative anatomy to explore the mechanisms underlying the origin of form. After this initial drive, Claudio Barros beginning in the late 1960s and Juan Fernández in the late 1970s, contributed with unique and complementary facets to the early growth of the discipline. In the 1980s, the community of developmental biologists created its first forms of association together with the reproduction biology community, and in 1993 the first international course of developmental biology was organised. During the 1990s and 2000s, a group of young investigators arrived in Chile after postdocs in Europe and the US to build the first research centres of developmental biology, fostering the discipline to an unprecedented level. In the 2010s, as these centres consolidated, a stream of young developmental biologists established new labs at several institutions, expanding the community size and broadening its scope. The recent organisation of developmental biology meetings fostered the sense of community and nurtured the need of formal organisation, setting the bases for the foundation of the Chilean Society for Developmental Biology in 2019. Today, the community of developmental biologists is a mix of young and experienced investigators working in a variety of geographical locations, institutions, topics and model organisms. These characteristics are a strength of an active community that is pushing the discipline to the next level, aiming to make it a relevant actor in national and international settings.","Concha, Miguel L; Signore, Iskra A",The International journal of developmental biology,https://doi.org/10.1387/ijdb.200181mc; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32930363/,466

103428,Foreword.,2020-08-01,"PURPOSE Cancer disparities persist among medically underserved populations despite widespread efforts to address them. We describe the development of a framework for addressing cancer care disparities across the cancer care continuum (CCC), guided by the CCC domains established by the Institute of Medicine/National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (IOM/NAS). MATERIALS AND METHODS An environmental scan was conducted to identify strategies and associated experts who are providing or have successfully provided community- and/or patient-centric IOM/NAS-defined domain standards to our target populations. A multistakeholder expert roundtable working group was convened for framework development. A premeeting survey informed agenda development, documented expert practices for target populations, and identified priority areas for meeting focus. RESULTS The environmental scan identified 84 unique experts across 8 stakeholder groups and 44 patient organizations; 50 were invited to the roundtable and 33 participated. They broadly represented disease sites, geography, and experience with target populations and all CCC domains. The premeeting survey (16 responses) identified coordination of care or patient navigation (66.7%), community engagement (60.0%), and healthcare system changes (53.3%) as priority focus areas. The experts identified access and treatment barriers or gaps within and between CCC domains, specified key notable practices to address these, and developed an actionable framework and recommendations for each priority focus area. CONCLUSION The framework and recommendations are intended to guide researchers, healthcare leaders, advocates, community- and patient-focused service organizations, and policy leaders to address and promote health equity in cancer care access and treatment outcomes.","Winkfield, Karen M; Regnante, Jeanne M; Miller-Sonet, Ellen; González, Evelyn T; Freund, Karen M; Doykos, Patricia M",JCO oncology practice,https://doi.org/10.1200/op.20.00630; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33464925/,466
106036,Regulating 3D-Printed Guns PostHeller: Why Two Steps Are Better Than One.,2020-12-01,"BACKGROUND While laparoscopy is now the standard for cholecystectomy, recent papers have focused on single-incision approaches. Intraoperative cholangiography remains an integral part of laparoscopic cholecystectomy but has not yet been well described within the single-access literature. We discuss our method of single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy with routine intraoperative cholangiograms. METHODS A retrospective review of our surgical database was completed. One hundred twenty-three patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy were identified (83 standard laparoscopy, 40 single-incision laparoscopy). Patient demographics including age and body mass index (BMI), and indications for surgery, operative time, intra- and postoperative complications, and ability to complete cholangiography were analyzed. RESULTS All patients with standard laparoscopy had successful cholangiograms. Two patients did not undergo cholangiography based on a preoperative decision (pregnancy). In the 40 patients who underwent single-incision cholecystectomy, 38 cholangiograms were completed (95%). One patient with acute cholecystitis had a small cystic duct which could not be cannulated. The second had a cystic duct through which the cholangiocatheter could not be advanced. Comparative analysis of patient demographics showed a significant difference in patient age between the two groups, as well as a significantly greater number of patients undergoing single-incision cholecystectomy for symptomatic cholelithiasis as opposed to acute cholecystitis. DISCUSSION Completion of intraoperative cholangiography is an important aspect of cholecystectomy in order to identify choledocholithiasis and verify anatomy. With the advent of single-access laparoscopy, standard operative principles should not be compromised. Cholangiography may provide a safer approach to cholecystectomy when adopting a new technique. We present our technique of single-incision cholecystectomy and routine cholangiography with a 95% success rate. The ability to perform single-incision intraoperative cholangiograms will allow a safe, more minimally invasive approach to cholecystectomy with suspected choledocholithiasis and obviate the need to convert to standard multiport laparoscopy for the sole reason of completing cholangiograms.","Bagloo, Melissa B; Dakin, Gregory F; Mormino, Lori P; Pomp, Alfons",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-010-1408-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21046159/,466

We present the case of a South Asian young man presenting with raised intracranial pressure and a lymphocytic cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with pronounced hypoglycorrhachia. Progression of the neuro-ophthalmic signs while on early stages of antitubercular treatment led to additional investigations that produced a final diagnosis of primary leptomeningeal lymphoma. Treatment with chemoimmunotherapy (methotrexate, cytarabine, thiotepa and rituximab (MATRix)) achieved full radiological remission followed by successful autologous transplant. This case highlights the difficulties and diagnostic dilemmas when PCNSL presents as a chronic meningeal infiltrative process. While contextually this CSF is most often indicative of central nervous system tuberculosis and justifies empirical treatment initiation alone, it is essential to include differential diagnoses in the investigation work-up, which also carry poor prognosis without timely treatment. High suspicion, multidisciplinary collaboration and appropriate CSF analysis were the key for a correct diagnosis.","Sumangala, Salini; Htwe, Thidar; Ansari, Yousuf; Martinez-Alvarez, Lidia",BMJ case reports,https://doi.org/10.1136/bcr-2021-243574; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34518180/,466

In this study, the effect of sweat accumulation on signal amplitude and mean frequency (MF) was examined to determine if the sEMG signal becomes altered through the sweat layer and whether this effect can be avoided by interrupting the pool of sweat using a thin strip of medical adhesive between the electrode snaps. Nine males performed a maximum, isometric contraction of their right quadriceps as sEMG was collected. Skin conditions under the electrode were dry and wet in incremental layers of 0.02 mm of artificial sweat. The results demonstrated that sweat accumulation under sEMG electrodes dampens the amplitude of the EMG signal in a predictable way (r = .88 and .97 for double and single snap electrodes, respectively) with almost 2% and 3% deterioration for every 0.02 mm of sweat depending on the type of electrode used. The medical adhesive proved to be highly effective at preventing amplitude deterioration indicating that signal shunting can be prevented. MF was not influenced by sweat accumulation even under the extreme wet condition.","Abdoli-Eramaki, Mohammad; Damecour, Caroline; Christenson, John; Stevenson, Joan",Journal of electromyography and kinesiology : official journal of the International Society of Electrophysiological Kinesiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jelekin.2012.04.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22613823/,466
139721,Following the Money: The ACA's Fiscal-Political Economy and Lessons for Future Health Care Reform.,2020-09-01,"BACKGROUND One of the merits of endoscopic surgery is that it can be performed through small remote incisions made in inconspicuous areas. To improve cosmetic outcomes of surgical treatment of benign breast lesions, we performed endoscopic surgery through minimally sized axillary incisions with the goal of achieving scar-free breasts. METHODS From August 2007 to August 2008, 18 patients with 20 benign breast lesions underwent endoscopic breast excision in our institution. Endoscopic resection of benign breast lesions was performed via the retromammary route with video assistance. Cosmetic results were evaluated using the five-item, four-step ABNSW scoring system, assessing breast asymmetry, breast shape, nipple shape, skin condition, and wound scars. RESULTS The median age of the patients was 27 years (IQR 23.0, 29.0). Median resected lesion size was 3.3 cm (IQR 2.9, 3.9). Median operative time was 85.0 min (IQR 70.0, 100.0). A marginally significant difference in operative times was noted between fibroadenoma and/or juvenile fibroadenoma cases and mastopathy or benign phyllodes cases (80.0 vs. 100.0; p < 0.06). Median total ABNSW score was 14 points. Postoperatively, 5 patients had mild local subcutaneous emphysema, and one had transient brachial palsy. No breast ecchymosis or deformity was noted. No major complications developed in any patient, and 89% of patients had good or excellent results. CONCLUSIONS Video-assisted endoscopic breast surgery has changed routine breast surgery, manifesting cosmetic effects that cannot be achieved by previous routine surgical techniques. Patients with multiple or large benign tumors who desire excellent cosmetic results are good candidates for this approach.","Liu, Hsien; Huang, Chih-Kun; Yu, Po-Chin; Chen, Hsin-Pao; Hsieh, Pei-Min; Hung, Kao-Chen; Hung, Chao-Ming; Chen, Yaw-Sen",World journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00268-009-0225-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19771469/,466

It is caused due to point mutation that substitutes glutamate with valine at the sixth amino acid position of the beta chain of hemoglobin molecules leading to the sickling of the red blood cells and decreased structural deformability. Silent cerebral infarcts are the most common neurological complication of SCA, while overt stroke comprises substantial burden in patients with SCA. This meta-analysis aimed to find the pooled prevalence of overt stroke in SCA patients and discuss the importance of screening them. PubMed, Embase, and Google Scholar were the electronic databases used to search the studies. A total of 765 articles were retrieved upon detailed searching in the abovementioned databases. After a series of removing duplicate articles, title and abstract screening, and full-text review, 20 articles were found eligible and included in the study. The total number of participants from all the included studies was 3,956, and pooled prevalence of stroke in patients with sickle cell anemia in Asia was found to be 5% (95% CI: 4%, 6%) with a range from 1 to 41%. Stroke occurrence in sickle cell anemia patients is an emergency complication that needs immediate intervention and management. Because of the high prevalence of stroke in patients with sickle cell anemia, clinicians should focus on its prevention and treatment strategies.","Kuikel, Sandip; Rauniyar, Robin; Kharel, Sanjeev; Bist, Anil; Giri, Subarna; Thapaliya, Sahil; Paudel, Sunanda",Neurology research international,https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/9961610; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34150339/,466

METHODS Cross-sectional, anonymous, online, population-based survey questionnaire was administered to parents aged 21 years and above with children aged between 3 and 16 years attending pre-school, primary or secondary school (equivalent to kindergarten, middle and-high school) and residing in Singapore. Sleep duration in relation to various daily activities including academic activities, physical exercise, and screen time was evaluated pre-CB and during CB. RESULTS Data from 593 participants were analyzed. Pre-CB, the overall mean (SD) sleep duration of the study population was 9.01 (1.18) hours on weekdays and 9.99 (0.94) hours on weekends. During CB, mean (SD) sleep duration overall was 9.63 (1.18) hours. Although children generally went to bed later (mean 0.65 h later), they woke up even later during CB (mean 1.27 h later), resulting in longer sleep duration (mean increase of 0.35 h). This was most evident in secondary school children (mean increase of 0.70 h). Children attending private schools (which had later start times) had increased sleep duration (mean 10.01 (SD 0.89) hours pre-CB and 10.05 (SD 0.93) hours during CB) compared to public schools (mean 9.05 (SD 0.91) pre-CB and 9.49 (SD 1.22) hours during CB). CONCLUSIONS School closure from the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in longer sleep duration in school-going children. Early school/academic activity start times had a significant impact on limiting children's sleep duration.","Lim, Michael Teik Chung; Ramamurthy, Mahesh Babu; Aishworiya, Ramkumar; Rajgor, Dimple D; Tran, Anh Phuong; Hiriyur, Prerana; Kunaseelan, Shangari; Jabri, Majid; Goh, Daniel Yam Thiam",Sleep medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sleep.2020.12.025; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33422812/,466

METHODS Real-time polymerase chain reaction confirmed COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 pneumonia patients were retrospectively analyzed. The presence of hypertension, coronary artery disease (CAD), and pre-existing use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) were compared between the groups. RESULTS A total of 103 COVID-19 and 91 non-COVID-19 hospitalized viral pneumonia patients were enrolled. Hypertension and CAD were more common in patients with non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia than in patients with COVID-19 (39.6% vs 22.3%, respectively, p=0.012 and 24.2% vs 4.9%, respectively, p<0.001). In our study, 2.9% and 6.8% of patients with COVID-19 were on ACEIs and ARBs, respectively, whereas 13.2% and 19.8% of patients with non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia were on ACEIs and ARBs, respectively (p=0.009 and p=0.013). Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (p<0.001) was prominent in patients with non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia compared with patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSION Our study results indicate that hypertension and CAD are more common among patients with non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia than patients with COVID-19. The prevalence of ACEIs and ARBs use was not higher in patients with COVID-19. Our results support that the use of ACEIs and ARBs do not play a specific role in patients with COVID-19.","Görmez, Selçuk; Erel Kırışoğlu, Ceyda; Ekicibaşı, Mehmet Erkan; Değirmencioğlu, Aleks; Paudel, Ashok; Akan, Gökçe; Atalar, Fatmahan; Sarıgüzel, Nevin; Pamukçu, Burak",Turk Kardiyoloji Dernegi arsivi : Turk Kardiyoloji Derneginin yayin organidir,https://doi.org/10.5543/tkda.2021.87750; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34106062/,466

The new circumstances of learning have made digital learning or distance learning a solution to preserve the mission of educational system. Instructors, professors and students, have found themselves working in completely new conditions. While the global shutdown of educational institutions have caused a crucial interference in students learning, worldwide, digital innovations and emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence have captured the interest of many researchers in order to support the education system during this era of pandemic.

In a few short weeks, COVID-19 unravelled months of planning, separated the university community and shifted tertiary education to remote learning. This created a triangulated expectations–performance gap as to what could be reasonably implemented to support student learning, support educators and provide a continued sense of community. The purpose of this paper is to consider how educators could implement strategies to close the expectations gap created by COVID-19 remote learning.Design/methodology/approachThe authors consider the expectations gap through pre-COVID-19 pedagogical strategies and teaching methods, then outline how we modified them into COVID-19 teaching approaches and designs.FindingsThe authors found that although expectations differ between university administration, students and faculty staff, there are a number of paths educators can take to close the expectations gap, facilitate interaction and engagement while gently encouraging self-driven student learning in a difficult time.Originality/valueThe practical exemplars identify steps educators can take as support mechanisms for student learners to embrace and take control of their own education in the remote learning environment and convey the importance of maintaining a sense of belonging.

166536,Full Issue,2021,"The newly identified Coronavirus pneumonia, later called COVID-19, is highly transmissible and pathogenic. The most common symptoms of this disease are dry cough, sore throat, and fever. Symptoms can progress to a severe form of pneumonia with critical complications, including septic shock, pulmonary edema, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and multiple organ failure. A major obstacle in controlling the spread of this disease is the inefficiency and scarcity of medical tests. Increasing efforts have been made to develop deep learning (DL) methods to diagnose COVID-19 based on tomography images. These computer-aided diagnostic systems can assist in the early detection of abnormalities in COVID-19 and facilitate the monitoring of disease progression, potentially reducing mortality rates. In this study, we compared the popular resource extraction structures based on deep learning for the automatic classification of COVID-19. To obtain a more precise method, which is an essential learning component, a set of deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) was chosen to train our model. The performance of the proposed method was validated using a COVID-19 dataset with computed tomography (CT) images. This dataset is available to the public and contains hundreds of positive CT scans for the disease. DL methods were performed and the best classified CNN was able to achieve excellent diagnostic results for COVID-19.","Nunes, L. D.; Dantas, D. O.",Holos,https://doi.org/10.15628/holos.2021.11054,466
169062,Gambaran kesehatan mental mahasiswa di masa pandemi COVID-19,2021,"Older adults are particularly vulnerable to vaccine-preventable diseases (VDU), due to decreased immunity and increased comorbidity. Vaccination can support healthy ageing and help reduce morbidity, mortality, and loss of quality of life associated with VPDs. Despite the availability of effective vaccines, many countries, including the UK, fail to reach recommended coverage levels. Psychosocial factors are recognised as providing important insights into the determinants of vaccination uptake. Little research has sought to establish psychometrically sound scales of vaccine attitudes with older adults. In the present study, a total of 372 UK-based participants (65-92 years, M = 70.5 yrs, SD = 4.6) completed a cross-sectional, online survey measuring health and socio-demographic characteristics in relation to vaccination uptake for influenza, pneumococcal and shingles. Two recently developed vaccination attitude scales, the 5C scale and the Vaccination Attitudes Examination (VAX) scale, were also administered to test their reliability and validity for use with an older adult population. Additional scales used to examine convergent and discriminant validity, the Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire, the Perceived Sensitivity to Medicines Scale, the Medical Mistrust Index, the Perceived Stress Scale, and the Interpersonal Support Evaluation List, were included. The factor structure of the 5C and VAX scales was confirmed. Both scales showed good internal reliability, convergent, discriminant and concurrent validity, supporting their use with older adult populations. The 5C and VAX scales were found to be reliable and valid psychosocial measures of vaccine hesitancy and acceptance within a UK-based, older adult population. Future research could use these scales to evaluate the impact of psychological antecedents of vaccine uptake, and how concerns about vaccination may be understood and addressed among older adults.","Cogan, N.; Gallant, A.; Nicholls, L.; Rasmussen, S.; Young, D.; Williams, L.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.09.29.21263161v1?rss=1,466

This spike in unhealthy air quality in Philadelphia has affected the health of the population. Unhealthy air quality can be exacerbated by asbestos, which has been found in many Philadelphia elementary schools. Although asbestos usage is now highly regulated, it can still be found in consumer products and construction material today. Among the many factors contributing to asthma onset and other lung diseases, air pollution and dangerous air particles such as asbestos are important contributors. Children in these asbestos infected schools became exposed and ultimately sick which led to their eventual closure. Due to elementary aged children having immature and more vulnerable airways, this exposure may have led to increasing cases of respiratory distress. Methods: This research study analyzed publicly available asbestos data from Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act (AHERA) reports from four Philadelphia elementary schools (Laura H. Carnell, James J. Sullivan, Clara Barton, and Thomas M. Peirce) from 2016-2018 to further understand the influence of asbestos particles on asthma in children. Secondary data analysis determined the levels of asbestos contamination in each elementary school and the severity of the condition for each school. This was compared to child asthma prevalence during the selected time period. Results: Asbestos was mainly found in the 2-6 inch pipe insulation and tiles within each school. Between 0.06 and 1.18% asbestos damage was found in 2-6inch pipe insulation in schools closed for asbestos abatement. An r2 of 0.9997 was found when comparing the 206inch pipe damage percentage and the newly friable material found in each school. Thomas M. Pierce Elementary was determined to be the highest concern according to the analysis of the AHERA reports. Conclusion: Children exposed to asbestos in elementary schools, and with a predisposition to asthma, were more likely to suffer from respiratory distress, due to the multiple contributing environmental factors.","Mulloth, R.; Blackley, A.; Koszuta, P.; Nemes, K.; Vail, M.; Zhang, M.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.08.21258548v1?rss=1,466

176527,COVID : d’une situation aiguë à une situation chronique en UGA,2021,"The objective of this retrospective review was to assess barriers to successful clinical trial enrollment among gynecologic cancer patients at a comprehensive cancer center. A retrospective chart review was performed of all new patients and established patients requiring treatment changes seen in a clinic setting by physicians in the gynecologic oncology department at a national cancer institute between July 1, 2019, and June 30, 2020. Demographic information collected for each patient included age, race, language, distance from the cancer center, insurance type, marital status, education, performance status and medical history. Demographic factors were compared between patients who enrolled in trials and those who were deemed eligible for clinical trials but did not enroll. Patients who did not enroll in a clinical trial were stratified by the reason for not enrolling as physician factor, patient factor, trial factor, and screening failure. Data was collected in a secure REDCap database. Data was analyzed using the Wilcoxon rank sum test and Fisher's exact test. 960 records were reviewed and 165 patients were found to be eligible for a clinical trial at the time of their visit. 35 of these 165 patients (21.2%) enrolled in a clinical trial. Among patients who did not enroll in a clinical trial, the reasons for not doing so were due to a physician factor (71/130 or 55%), patient factor (42/130 or 32%), screening failure (13/130 or 10%), or a trial factor (4/130 or 3%). There were no significant differences in demographics between patients who enrolled in trials and those who did not. Patients who did not enroll secondary to a physician factor differed significantly from those enrolled or attempted to enroll in age and insurance type. Patients who did not enroll secondary to a physician factor were older when compared to those who enrolled or attempted to enroll in a clinical trial but failed the screening process (median of 70 vs 61.5 years old, p=0.014). They were also more likely to have Medicare and less likely to have private insurance (p=0.044). Patients who did not enroll secondary to a patient factor did not appear to differ significantly from patients who did enroll or who failed screening. Although patients who did not enroll secondary to a patient factor lived a mean distance almost twice as far away as those who enrolled or attempted to enroll (mean of 184 vs 91 miles), this was not statistically significant (p=0.107). Based on a one year time span of retrospective review, including the COVID 19 pandemic time, physician factor and concern for a patient's age appears to be the biggest barrier to clinical trial enrollment. Exploring additional reasons behind physicians' reluctance to enroll patients in trials may be the key to increasing clinical trial enrollment of eligible patients.

Face to face interviews were made in 29% (33/114) of the patients who were consulted from COVÍD-19 clinics. In 71% (81/114) patients, electrocardiography (ECG) s were evaluated digitally. In this study, although there was a decrease in the number of hospitalized patients during the COVÍD-19 pandemia, we observed an increase in the number of patients being consulted to cardiology clinic. The relationship between COVÍD-19 disease and cardiovascular diseases and drugs being used in the treatment increased the workload of the cardiology clinic during the pandemic period.","Babat, N.; Duz, R.; Karaduman, M.; Tuncer, M.",Eastern Journal of Medicine,https://doi.org/10.5505/ejm.2021.02359,466
182667,Updates in service standards in hotels: how COVID-19 changed operations,2021,"In our society, geospatial data are used for multiple purposes, and their use has grown exponentially in recent decades, especially with the emergence of COVID-19. In this sense, universities play a key role in the geospatial domain from two points of view: the formation of students in this field in society, and the transfer and communication of knowledge. Considering the university-age population in Spain, a study was carried out in autonomous communities on the training provided by degrees that educate future spatial data managers (i.e., Bachelor Degree in Engineering in Geomatics and Surveying and Bachelor Degree of Geography) and the disciplines in which geospatial data are treated indirectly. The results show that universities offer two degrees providing direct training and seven degrees providing indirect training in geospatial data management per 100,000 inhabitants of university age. A high correlation of R-2 = 0.84 has been found between the number of degrees that provide direct training and the number of geospatial services offered by Spanish universities, and most of these degrees and resources are offered by public universities. Although there are good prospects for the future of the geospatial industry, the number of students pursuing these degrees is decreasing by 5% while the number of students enrolled in all degrees in the country has increased by 4.3%. It seems important to reorient more training towards the current direction of the geodata market and online training. (C) 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Polo, M.

Methods The first 15 participants were enrolled, in groups of 5, to receive two doses, separated by 21 days, of one of three dose concentrations, administered intramuscularly. 138 further participants were randomised 1:1:1 to receive the same 3 dose concentrations, in a double blinded manner. Primary outcomes were solicited adverse reactions 7 days after each vaccination and neutralising antibody geometric mean titres (GMT) against SARS-CoV-2, 2 weeks after the second vaccination (day 36), measured by live microneutralisation assay against wild-type virus (MNA50). Secondary outcomes included unsolicited adverse events, and humoral and cellular responses at day 36, measured by IgG ELISA against Spike protein and interferon-gamma secreting T-cells by ELISpot stimulated with multiple SARS-CoV-2 antigens.

183182,Biomédica en PubMed Central (®),2020-12-09,"Background: The new coronavirus disease has become a public health emergency that has not been seen for generations. Covid-19 disease leads to an extreme immune activation and cytokine response and constitutes a big risk and a challenge for patients with inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). During the Covid-19 pandemic, rheumatologists and health-care professionals have faced many challenges to provide an adequate follow-up and treatment to RA patients;one of them, has been the establishment of lockdown for populations older than 60 years and the limitation of having face-to-face consultations, moving us to telemedicine activities. On the other hand, in our center an education program for patients with RA had been established in the second semester of 2019, which due to the epidemiological risk control measures, it was necessary to interrupt when we only had 5-6 months of a project that was planned for 2 years;it was mandatory to pause it and implement virtual education alternatives;this educational program for RA patients was also moved to virtual mode later. Objectives: To describe possible changes in the practices and behaviors of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) during the lockdown that started in March 2020 in Colombia due to the Covid-19 pandemic, who previously partially attended to an educational program on RA. Methods: We included patients who attended previously a face-to-face educational program, that aims to teach and empower patients in all aspects related to RA. After the lockdown, the educational program had to stop abruptly while an online strategy was developed later;meanwhile the patients did not have any educational activity for 3-4 months. For this study, patients answered to a telephonic survey in July 2020;the survey included questions about their practices related to the Covid-19 pandemic, SARS-Cov-2 symptoms, adherence to rheumatoid arthritis treatment, virtual rheumatology consultations compliance and, the influence of news on their adherence. Results: A total of 260 patients took part in the survey;mean age of the respondents was 60 years IQR (54-66), 93% were female. In July 2020 88% of patients had accessed a telemedicine-based and 12% a face-to-face rheumatology consultation;only 3.5% of patients reported having been less adherent to pharmacological therapy due to information received through media or social networks. Regarding the prevention measures taken during the pandemic, 98% reported to have stayed in their houses since the lockdown was stablished in Colombia, and have implemented or increased hand washing from one or none to more than three times per day. Also 8% of respondents lived with people who were at bigger risk of having SARS-CoV-2 (i.e. health care professionals, workers at public transportation, and supermarkets among others), the main measurement taken was to be completely separate from the person at risk to avoid contagion and maintaining hygiene measures and physical distancing (Fig 1). Only one patient was positive for SARS-CoV-2, due to a possible contagion from a relative at home and reported only flu-like symptoms without any complications. Patients highlighted the necessity to return to the educational on RA program agreeing to attend to an online modality. Patients highlighted the need for educational sessions focused on the relationship between rheumatoid arthritis, its treatment, and Covid-19. Conclusion: An educational on RA program shows to be helpful tool to maintain high adherence rates to the RA treatment despite of the new challenges associated to the pandemic and despite being incomplete due to lack of time;patient-centered education programs should continue to address the patient's concerns and beliefs about their disease and the Covid-19 issues.","Rodriguez, F.; Buitrago-Garcia, D.; Sánchez, G.; Santos-Moreno, P.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2021-eular.3434,466

The infectious disease originated from East Asia and spread to the world. This unprecedented pandemic further damages the global economy. It seems highly probable that the COVID-19 recession changes stock market volatility. Therefore, this study resorts to the Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedastic (GARCH) model with a smooth transition method to capture the influences of the COVID-19 pandemic on the dynamic structure of the stock market index volatilities for some Asian countries (the Four Asian Tigers and Japan). The empirical results show that the shocks of the COVID-19 change the dynamic volatility structure for all stock market indices. Moreover, we acquire the transition function for all stock market index volatilities and find out that most of their regime adjustment processes start following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Four Asian Tigers except South Korea and Japan. Additionally, the estimated transition functions show that the stock market index volatilities contain U-shaped patterns of structural changes. This article also computes the corresponding calendar dates of structure change about dynamic volatility patterns. In the light of estimation of location parameters, we demonstrate that the structure changing the date of stock market index volatility for South Korea and Japan has occurred in late 2019.","Liu, Day-Yang Chen Chun-Ming Su Yi-kai",International Journal of Research in Business and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.20525/ijrbs.v10i4.1177,466

184360,Quarantines and distributive justice.,2005,"Objectives: To determine the effectiveness and safety of a tool diverting low urgency patients eligible for primary care from an emergency department (ED) to the adjacent general practitioner cooperative (GPC). Methods: Unblinded, randomised controlled trial with weekends serving as clusters (three intervention clusters for each control). The intervention was nurse-led triage using a new tool assigning patients to either ED or GPC. During intervention weekends, patients were encouraged to follow this assignment while it was not communicated to the patients during control weekends (they remained at the ED). The primary outcome was the proportion of patients assigned to and handled by the GPC during intervention weekends. The trial was randomised for the secondary outcome: the proportion of patients assigned to the GPC during intervention and control weekends. Additional outcomes were association of these outcomes with possible confounders (study tool parameters, nurse, and patient characteristics), proportion of patients referred back to the ED by the GPC, hospitalisations, and performance of the study tool to detect primary care eligible patients (with the opinion of the treating physician as the gold standard). Results: In the intervention group, 838/6374 patients (13.3%, 95% CI 12.5 to 14.2) were assigned to the GPC (secondary outcome), in the control group 431/1744 (24.7%, 95% CI 22.7 to 26.8). In the intervention group, 599/6374 patients (9.5%, 95% CI 8.8 to 10.3) experienced the primary outcome which was influenced by the chosen MTS presentational flowchart, patient's age, and the nurse. 24/599 patients (4.0%, 95% CI 2.7 to 5.9) patients were referred back to the ED of which three were hospitalised. Positive and negative predictive values of the studied tool during intervention weekends were 0.96 (95%CI 0.94 to 0.97) and 0.60 (95% CI 0.58 to 0.62). Out of the patients assigned to the GPC, 2.4% (95% CI 1.7 to 3.4) were hospitalised. Conclusions: ED nurses using a new tool safely diverted 9.5% of the included patients to primary care.

The available clinical data suggest that patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 have the possibility of simultaneous infection of bacteria. In this study, we present a data-driven mathematical model for coinfection of SARS-CoV-2 and bacteria to investigate the dynamics of COVID-19 progress. Specifically, based on the statistical analysis of different clinical data from China and some other countries, a system model with ordinary differential equations (ODEs) in four variables, i.e. SARS-CoV-2, bacteria, neutrophils and lymphocytes, is established. We further validate our model through theoretical analysis and fitting of different clinical data. Moreover, through numerical simulations and bifurcation analysis, we find that bacterial infection and immune-related parameters in certain ranges lead to the system transitions among three steady states, i.e. mild, severe and death. We also analyzed the influence of the time it takes for patients to switch from a high-risk area to a low-risk area on the recovery time. These results reveal that the coinfection of viruses and bacteria can explain the changes in neutrophils and lymphocytes, and that initial bacterial infection and immune-related parameters have great influences on the severity degree and mortality in COVID-19 patients. Together, our model and quantitative analysis suggest that preventing bacterial infection and enhancing immune ability during the early phase of infections could be a potential treatment option for high-risk COVID-19 patients.","Zhou, Yu Huang Mingzhan Ying’an Jiang Zou Xiufen",International Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos in Applied Sciences and Engineering,https://doi.org/10.1142/s0218127421501637,466

METHODS The following questionnaires were used: The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADs) and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R).Worries regarding the COVID-19 on patients' lives, socio-demographic and clinical details were collected using a brief structured questionnaire. RESULTS One-hundred seventy-eight outpatients were enrolled. We found that 55% of patients were above the cut-off for HADS general scale and 23.7% had severe level of PTSD. The 68% of patients declared that their worries have increased during the pandemic especially for women. Patients with lung cancer have higher general distress compared with patients with breast cancer and lymphoma. The non cancer sample had values significantly higher both for the IES-R scales and for HADS Depression subscale. Finally, cancer patients who experienced the health emergency showed higher levels of anxiety than those measured 2 years ago. CONCLUSION Cancer out-patients of the present sample have severe post-traumatic stress symptoms and psychological distress, those with lung cancer are at higher risk and may need special attention. Non-oncological subjects have higher depression levels than cancer patients.","Bafunno, Daniela; Romito, Francesca; Lagattolla, Fulvia; Delvino, Vito Antonio; Minoia, Carla; Loseto, Giacomo; Dellino, Miriam; Guarini, Attilio; Catino, Annamaria; Montrone, Michele; Longo, Vito; Pizzutilo, Pamela; Galetta, Domenico; Giotta, Francesco; Latorre, Agnese Carmela; Russo, Anna; Lorusso, Vito; Cormio, Claudia",Journal of B.U.ON. : official journal of the Balkan Union of Oncology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34268981/,466

We investigated the incidence and prognostic implications of early hepatic dysfunction (serum bilirubin >2 mg/dL within 48 hrs of admission). DESIGN Prospective, multicenter cohort study. SETTING Thirty-two medical, surgical, and mixed intensive care units. PATIENTS A total of 38,036 adult patients admitted consecutively over a period of 4 yrs. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Excluding patients with preexisting cirrhosis (n = 691; 1.8%) and acute or acute-on-chronic hepatic failure (n = 108, 0.3%), we identified 4,146 patients (10.9%) with early hepatic dysfunction. These patients had different baseline characteristics, longer median intensive care unit stays (5 vs. 3 days; p < .001) and increased hospital mortality (30.4% vs. 16.4%; p < .001). Hepatic dysfunction was also associated with higher observed-to-expected mortality ratios (1.02 vs. 0.91; p < .001). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed an independent mortality risk of hepatic dysfunction (odds ratio, 1.86; 95% confidence interval, 1.71-2.03; p < .001), which exceeded the impact of all other organ dysfunctions. A case-control study further confirmed these results: Patients with early hepatic dysfunction exhibited significantly increased raw and risk-adjusted mortality compared with control subjects. CONCLUSIONS Our results provide strong evidence that early hepatic dysfunction, occurring in 11% of critically ill patients, presents a specific and independent risk factor for poor prognosis.","Kramer, Ludwig; Jordan, Barbara; Druml, Wilfred; Bauer, Peter; Metnitz, Philipp G H",Critical care medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17334250/,466

Recent studies suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection predisposes to thromboembolic event such as pulmonary embolism. Moreover, there is an overlap between signs and symptoms of pulmonary embolism and COVID-19, which brings a challenge for the diagnosis and could potentially be fatal. Nevertheless, the incidence rate of pulmonary embolism in cases of COVID-19 is currently not known.

189308,"Through the quarantine looking glass: drug-resistant tuberculosis and public health governance, law, and ethics.",2007,"Earlier studies have demonstrated that the genes of the human carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) family can be divided into three subgroups, the CEA subgroup (n = 12), the pregnancy-specific glycoprotein (PSG) subgroup (n = 11), and a third subgroup (n = 6). To further characterize the CEA gene family, we have determined the genomic structures of CGM9 and CGM11, analyzed the promoter regions of all eleven PSGs, studied the CGM15-PSG13 intergenic region and the evolutionary relationships beween the CEA family genes. CGM9, a typical CEA subgroup member, was a pseudogene with the exon structure [5'UTR-L-L/N-TM-Cyt-3'UTR]. CGM11 contained a mixture of exons derived from CEA and PSG subgroup genes. The formula of the CGM11 pseudogene was [5'UTR-L-L/N-C-3'UTR]. Thus both genes lacked the IgC2-like domains typically found in CEA subfamily members. The upstream promoter regions of all eleven PSGs were characterized. All PSG promoters lacked the classical TATA and CCAAT elements, but had putative PEA3 box(es), CACCC box(es), a RARE box, and poly (dG-dT) repeats of different lengths. Five PSGs also had an SP1 site. The complete 10-kb intergenic region between CGM15 and PSG13 was sequenced. Clusters of different types of repetitive sequences were seen. The time of divergence of the CEA and PSG subfamilies was estimated to be 107.7 +/- 17.1 million years, or at about the time of human-rodent divergence. Models for the evolution of CEA and PSG and the third family subgroup genes are proposed.","Frängsmyr, L; Israelsson, A; Teglund, S; Matsunaga, T; Hammarström, S",Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10686536/,466

The interacting surface between alpha-helices in a classical coiled coil is formed by interspersing nonpolar side chains at the a and d positions with hydrophilic residues at the flanking e and g positions. To explore how the chemical nature of these core amino acids dictates the overall coiled-coil architecture, we replaced all eight e and g residues in the GCN4 leucine zipper with nonpolar alanine side chains. Surprisingly, the alanine-containing mutant forms a stable alpha-helical heptamer in aqueous solution. The 1.25-A resolution crystal structure of the heptamer reveals a parallel seven-stranded coiled coil enclosing a large tubular channel with an unusual heptad register shift between adjacent staggered helices. The overall geometry comprises two interleaved hydrophobic helical screws of interacting cross-sectional a and d layers that have not been seen before. Moreover, asparagines at the a positions play an essential role in heptamer formation by participating in a set of buried interhelix hydrogen bonds. These results demonstrate that heptad repeats containing four hydrophobic positions can direct assembly of complex, higher-order coiled-coil structures with rich diversity for close packing of alpha-helices.","Liu, Jie; Zheng, Qi; Deng, Yiqun; Cheng, Chao-Sheng; Kallenbach, Neville R; Lu, Min",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17030805/,466

The extremely high homology of the viral genomic sequences between the viruses isolated from human (huSARS-CoV) and those of palm civet origin (pcSARS-CoV) suggested possible palm civet-to-human transmission. Genetic analysis revealed that the spike (S) protein of pcSARS-CoV and huSARS-CoV was subjected to the strongest positive selection pressure during transmission, and there were six amino acid residues within the receptor-binding domain of the S protein being potentially important for SARS progression and tropism. Using the single-round infection assay, we found that a two-amino acid substitution (N479K/T487S) of a huSARS-CoV for those of pcSARS-CoV almost abolished its infection of human cells expressing the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 but no effect upon the infection of mouse ACE2 cells. Although single substitution of these two residues had no effects on the infectivity of huSARS-CoV, these recombinant S proteins bound to human ACE2 with different levels of reduced affinity, and the two-amino acid-substituted S protein showed extremely low affinity. On the contrary, substitution of these two amino acid residues of pcSARS-CoV for those of huSRAS-CoV made pcSARS-CoV capable of infecting human ACE2-expressing cells. These results suggest that amino acid residues at position 479 and 487 of the S protein are important determinants for SARS-CoV tropism and animal-to-human transmission.","Qu, Xiu-Xia; Hao, Pei; Song, Xi-Jun; Jiang, Si-Ming; Liu, Yan-Xia; Wang, Pei-Gang; Rao, Xi; Song, Huai-Dong; Wang, Sheng-Yue; Zuo, Yu; Zheng, Ai-Hua; Luo, Min; Wang, Hua-Lin; Deng, Fei; Wang, Han-Zhong; Hu, Zhi-Hong; Ding, Ming-Xiao; Zhao, Guo-Ping; Deng, Hong-Kui",The Journal of biological chemistry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15980414/,466

The potential for H5N1 influenza to cause a pandemic of human disease continues to be the subject of intense scrutiny by both the media and the scientific community. While the likelihood of such a prospect is uncertain, the inevitability of future pandemics of influenza is clear. Planning for the eventuality of a virulent influenza pandemic at the local, national and global level is critical to limiting the mortality and morbidity of such an occurrence. Hospitalists have a key role to play in institutional efforts to prepare for a influenza pandemic, and should be aware of lessons that my be applied from both the response to Hurricane Katrina, as well as the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic.","Pile, James C; Gordon, Steven M",Journal of hospital medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17219482/,466

Immune reactivity to HPV as well as novel immunotherapeutic and preventative strategies are discussed. RECENT FINDINGS Many AIDS-associated neoplasms are associated with HPV infection. Whether cervical cancer is truly an AIDS-associated neoplasm has recently been questioned, while the association of anal cancer with AIDS in both males and females is more convincing. Recent reports cast doubt on the efficacy of HAART therapy for HPV-induced anogenital neoplasms, despite efficacy in improving disease caused by other infectious agents. We include here new data on humoral and cellular immune responses to HPV. VLP serology has been reported to be associated with outcome of cervical cancer. VLP seropositivity has been reported to be a favorable prognostic sign in women with HPV 16 positive cervical carcinoma. Several investigators have questioned the immunogenicity of the oncogenic HPV type 16 compared with other HPV types. It has recently been found that in HIV-infected patients, lymphoproliferative cellular immune responses (CMI) to HPV 16 peptides are not associated with CD4 counts, whereas responses to recall antigens and mitogens are associated with CD4 counts. CD4 + T cells may not be responsible for protective cellular immune responses to HPV. VLP serology and CMI responses may be the future intermediate surrogate biomarkers for HPV-associated anogenital neoplasia trials. Several new therapeutic vaccine strategies for management of HPV-induced neoplasia are reviewed. SUMMARY Most anogenital neoplasms occurring with increased frequency in patients with HIV/AIDS are associated with HPV infections. Current treatment strategies are not effective in clearing anogenital HPV infection and need improvement. Immunotherapy with novel vaccines will provide both prevention and therapy for these common malignancies.","Einstein, Mark H; Kadish, Anna S",Current opinion in oncology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15314515/,466

In this case 'syndrome' means: behavior, signs and symptoms that may be indicative of an infection, without a proven pathogen, or incidents such as an environmental disaster. Syndromic surveillance has gained momentum in response to various international infectious disease threats, including the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003. In several European countries, syndromic surveillance has been used to monitor the impact of outbreaks or natural disasters and the health of visitors of mass events. Following the outbreak of an infectious disease, syndromic surveillance can be reassuring in the absence of an epidemic. Insight into burden of disease can provide guidance in adjusting care capacity to need. Several syndromic surveillance systems and pilot studies have been set up recently in the Netherlands. The costs, benefits and their best application should be evaluated in the near future.","van Asten, Liselotte; Fanoy, Ewout B; Hooiveld, Mariëtte; Koopmans, Marion P G; Kretzschmar, Mirjam E E",Nederlands tijdschrift voor geneeskunde,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24975977/,466

This occurred under serum-free defined, but not serum-supplemented, growth conditions. The importance of neurons in establishing infections in mixed cultures was confirmed by immunocytochemical and electron microscopic studies. Glia, although more abundant than neurons in these cultures, were less frequently infected during the initial 48 h postinoculation. The two glial lineages present in mixed telencephalic cultures were separated into type-1 astrocytes and oligodendrocyte-type-2 astrocyte (O-2A) lineage cells and individually assessed for their ability to support virus growth. Infection could not be established in type-1 astrocytes regardless of the culture conditions employed, consistent with our previous study (S. Beushausen and S. Dales, Virology 141:89-101, 1985). In contrast, infections could be initiated in selected O-2A lineage cells grown in serum-free medium. Virus multiplication was however significantly reduced by preconditioning the medium with mixed telencephalic or enriched type-1 astrocyte cultures, suggesting that intercellular interactions mediated by soluble factor(s) can influence the infectious process in O-2A lineage cells. This presumption was supported by eliciting similar effects with basic fibroblast growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor, two central nervous system cytokines known to control O-2A differentiation. The presence of these cytokines, which synergistically block O-2A cells from differentiating into oligodendrocytes was correlated with specific and reversible resistance to JHM virus (JHMV) infection. These data, combined with our finding that accelerated terminal differentiation of the oligodendrocyte phenotype confers resistance to JHMV (Beushausen and Dales, Virology, 1985), suggest that the permissiveness of O-2A cells for JHMV is restricted to a discrete developmental stage.","Pasick, J M; Dales, S",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1651420/,466
194653,Back to the future: rebuilding public health infrastructure.,2004,"The positive-stranded RNA genome of the arterivirus Equine arteritis virus (order Nidovirales) encodes the partially overlapping replicase polyproteins pp1a (1727 aa) and pp1ab (3175 aa). Previously, three viral proteinases were reported to cleave these large polyproteins into 12 non-structural proteins (nsps). The chymotrypsin-like viral main proteinase residing in nsp4 is responsible for eight of these cleavages. Processing of the C-terminal half of pp1a (the nsp3-8 region) was postulated to occur following either of two alternative proteolytic pathways (the 'major' and 'minor' pathways). Here, the importance of these two pathways was investigated by using a reverse-genetics system and inactivating each of the cleavage sites by site-directed mutagenesis. For all of these pp1a cleavage sites, mutations that prevented cleavage by the nsp4 proteinase were found to block or severely inhibit EAV RNA synthesis. Furthermore, our studies identified a novel nsp4 cleavage site (Glu-1575/Ala-1576) that is located within nsp7 and is conserved in arteriviruses. The N-terminal nsp7 fragment (nsp7alpha) derived from this cleavage was detected in lysates of both EAV-infected cells and cells transiently expressing pp1a. Mutagenesis of the novel cleavage site in the context of an EAV full-length cDNA clone proved to be lethal, underlining the fact that the highly regulated, nsp4-mediated processing of the C-terminal half of pp1a is a crucial event in the arterivirus life cycle.","van Aken, Danny; Zevenhoven-Dobbe, Jessika; Gorbalenya, Alexander E; Snijder, Eric J",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17098961/,466

The virion purified from feces from infected calves was a fringed particle with a diameter of about 100 nm. The incubation period from time of inoculation per orum to onset of diarrhea in calves was as short as 8 hours. The viral infection in bacteria-free calves or calves not contaminated with pathogenic bacteria caused severe illness for only 24 hours. When bacteria such as the K99 antigen Escherichia coli were present, the combined infection caused mortality. Lesions occurred only in the small intestinal villous epithelium. Calves euthanatized shortly before or after the onset of diarrhea had developed villous epithelial cell syncytia that contained numberous virions in the cytoplasm. Within 2 to 3 hours after onset of diarrhea, the infected cells were shed and the villi had denuded tips or had cuboidal to squamous epithelial cells.","Mebus, C A; Rhodes, M B; Underdahl, N R",American journal of veterinary research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/98080/,466

Immunofluorescent labeling of cells with an antiserum which recognizes p28, the ORF1a N-terminal cleavage product, resulted in widespread somewhat granular cytoplasmic staining, indicating that this protein is widely distributed in the cytoplasm of MHV-infected, but not control uninfected cells. Immunofluorescent staining of infected cells with antisera which recognize the downstream polypeptides, p65, p240 and p290 labeled discrete vesicular perinuclear structures. Double immunofluorescent labeling of BHK cells expressing the MHV receptor (BHK(MHVR1)) and infected with MHV-A59 with a Golgi-specific anti-mannosidase II monoclonal antibody and with antiserum recognizing each of these anti-MHV ORF1a polypeptides, showed that the p240 and p290 polypeptides were localized in discrete vesicular structures that overlapped the Golgi complex. Labeling with antibodies specific for p65 colocalized with the Golgi region, and showed staining of the perinuclear cytoplasm as well. Plasmids containing sequences contained in the first 6.75 kb of ORF1a have been expressed using the coupled vaccinia virus-T7 polymerase system. Immunofluorescent labeling of transfectants with the anti-ORF1a antisera showed patterns of antigen distribution similar to those observed in cells infected with MHV-A59. A deletion analysis with constructs containing only portions of the ORF1a sequence indicated that 303 amino acids containing the first papain-like protease domain (PLP-1) was sufficient to associate this protein with the Golgi.","Bi, W; Piñón, J D; Hughes, S; Bonilla, P J; Holmes, K V; Weiss, S R; Leibowitz, J L",Journal of neurovirology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10065901/,466
197571,Endovascular clot retrieval for acute ischaemic stroke: the Auckland City Hospital experience.,2015,"Upper respiratory tract infections caused by adenoviruses present long lasting fever for five days and elevated acute phase reactant levels. They are generally misdiagnosed as bacterial infections and are mistreated with antibiotics. The diagnosis of adenovirus infections mainly depends on direct antigen tests, virus isolation and detection of viral DNA using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical and laboratory findings of the children diagnosed as adenoviral respiratory tract infection by multiplex PCR (mPCR). A total of 27 children (18 male, 9 female; age range: 1-7 years, mean age: 4.4 years) whose nasopharyngeal swab samples were found positive for adenovirus DNA with a commercial mPCR method (Seeplex® RV15 ACE Detection Kit, Seegene Inc, Korea) were included in the study. The throat cultures of the patients revealed no bacterial pathogens and EBV VCA-IgM antibodies were negative. The clinical and laboratory data of the children with long lasting high fever diagnosed as adenovirus infection were evaluated retrospectively in terms of their complaints on admission, symptoms detected in physical examination, laboratory findings and therapy protocols. The patients were categorized according to hospitalization period (< 3 days or ≥ 3 days) and also according to the symptoms compatible with upper or lower respiratory tract infections. The quantity of clinical symptoms (≤ 2 or > 2) and the presence of upper or lower respiratory tract findings were evaluated if there were a difference by means of hospitalization rate and period. The most common complaint of the patients with adenoviral respiratory diseases was fever (27/27; 100%), and the most common admittance season was april-may-june period (20/27; 74%). The mean temperature was 38.4°C (range: 38-39.8°C) and the fever continued for 1-5 days after hospitalization. The most common physical examination finding was tonsillary hyperemia and hypertrophy (63%), followed by lower respiratory tract disease symptoms (37%), otitis media (14.8%), conjunctivitis (7.4%), and rash (3.7%). Laboratory tests could be performed for 24 cases and 95.8% of them yielded high CRP level, 87.5% high sedimentation rate, 62.5% neutrophilia, 33.4% leukocytosis and 20.8% lymphocytosis. It was noticed that 85.2% (23/27) of the patients were under antibiotic treatment on admission. Twenty-three patients (85.2%) were hospitalized, and the duration of hospitalization was between 1-8 (mean: 3.78) days. When the hospitalization rate was evaluated in terms of different measures, it was found that the rate was 81.8% (18/22) in patients with ≤ 2 symptoms, 100% in patients with > 2 symptoms (5/5); 100% (10/10) in patients with lower respiratory tract disease symptoms; 100% (15/15) in patients with neutrophilia, 88.2% (15/17) in patients with CRP levels of ≥ 2.8 - < 100 mg/L, and 100% (6/6) in patients with CRP levels of ≥ 100 mg/L. Neutrophilia and high CRP levels were found to be the main factors related to the hospitalization rate (p< 0.05). In conclusion, adenoviral etiology should be determined by a rapid and sensitive laboratory method such as mPCR, in cases with tonsillopharyngitis who exhibit leukocytosis, neutrophilia and high CRP levels and no bacterial pathogens in throat culture, in order to prevent unnecessary antibiotic use and hospitalization.","Biçer, Suat; Küçük, Oznur; Giray, Tuba; Cöl, Defne; Ciler Erdağ, Gülay; Gürol, Yeşim; Yılmaz, Gülden; Vitrinel, Ayça",Mikrobiyoloji bulteni,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23621729/,466

There are inconsistent data on the causes of death after PCI, and the proportion of these deaths that are attributable to cardiac causes. METHODS All patients undergoing PCI in England between January 1, 2017 and May 10, 2020 (n = 273,141) were retrospectively analyzed according to their outcome from the date of PCI: no death, in-hospital death, postdischarge death, and total 30-day death. The present study examined short-term primary causes of death after PCI in a national cohort before and during COVID-19. RESULTS The overall rates of in-hospital and 30-day death were 1.9% and 2.8%, respectively. The rate of 30-day death declined between 2017 (2.9%) and February 2020 (2.5%), mainly due to lower in-hospital death (2.1% vs 1.5%), before rising again from March 1, 2020 (3.2%) due to higher rates of postdischarge mortality. Only 59.6% of 30-day deaths were due to cardiac causes, with the most common causes being acute coronary syndrome, cardiogenic shock, and heart failure, and this persisted throughout the study period. In the 30-day death group, 10.4% after March 1, 2020 were due to confirmed COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS In this nationwide study, we show that 40% of 30-day deaths are due to non-cardiac causes. Non-cardiac deaths have increased even more from the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, with 1 in 10 deaths from March 2020 being COVID-19 related. These findings raise a question of whether public reporting of PCI outcomes should be cause specific.","Mohamed, Mohamed O; Kinnaird, Tim; Curzen, Nick; Ludman, Peter; Wu, Jianhua; Rashid, Muhammad; Shoaib, Ahmad; de Belder, Mark; Deanfield, John; Gale, Chris P; Mamas, Mamas A",The Journal of invasive cardiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33348315/,466

While there has been intense investigation to find new methods to improve cutaneous wound care, the management of chronic wounds, burns, and skin wound infection remain challenging clinical problems. Ideally, advanced wound dressings can provide enhanced healing and bridge the gaps in the healing processes that prevent chronic wounds from healing. These technologies have great potential for improving outcomes in patients with poorly healing wounds but face significant barriers in addressing the heterogeneity and clinical complexity of chronic or severe wounds. Active wound dressings aim to enhance the natural healing process and work to counter many aspects that plague poorly healing wounds, including excessive inflammation, ischemia, scarring, and wound infection.

The outbreak and spread of these virulent diseases including avian influenza (H1N1), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-Corona virus), cholera (Vibrio cholera), tuberculosis (Mycobacterium tuberculosis), Ebola hemorrhagic fever (Ebola Virus) and AIDS (HIV-1) necessitate urgent attention to develop diagnostic protocols and assays for rapid detection and screening. Rapid and accurate detection of first cases with certainty will contribute significantly in preventing disease transmission and escalation to pandemic levels. As a result, there is a need to develop technologies that can meet the heavy demand of an all-embedded, inexpensive, specific and fast biosensing for the detection and screening of pathogens in active or latent forms to offer quick diagnosis and early treatments in order to avoid disease aggravation and unnecessary late treatment costs.

Comprehensive information on 1-year outcomes and health care utilization is lacking. Research conducted during the SARS outbreak may help inform research planning for future public health emergencies. The objective of this study was to evaluate the 1-year outcomes in survivors of SARS and their family caregivers. METHOD The study was prospective and observational. We evaluated 117 SARS survivors from Toronto, Ontario. Patients were interviewed and underwent physical examination, pulmonary function testing, chest radiography, a 6-minute-walk test, quality-of-life measures, and self-report of health care utilization. At 1 year, informal caregivers were identified for a survey on caregiver burden. RESULTS The enrolled survivors of SARS were young (median age, 42 years), and most were women (67%) and health care workers (65%). At 1 year after hospital discharge, pulmonary function measures were in the normal range, but 18% of patients had a significant reduction in distance walked in 6 minutes.

Evidence is now growing for increasing neurological symptoms. This is thought to be from direct in-situ effects in the olfactory bulb caused by the virus. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors likely serve as a key receptor for cell entry for most coronaviridae as they are present in multiple organ tissues in the body, notably neurons, and in type 2 alveolar cells in the lung. Hematogenous spread to the nervous system has been described, with viral transmission along neuronal synapses in a retrograde fashion. The penetration of the virus to the central nervous system (CNS) allows for the resulting intracranial cytokine storm, which can result in a myriad of CNS complications. There have been reported cases of associated cerebrovascular accidents with large vessel occlusions, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, meningoencephalitis, acute necrotizing encephalopathy, epilepsy, and myasthenia gravis.

211099,Heroes in white and the coronavirus epidemic/ Les héros en blanc et l’épidémie de coronavirus,2020,"Between the months of February and April of 2020, average weekly market hours in the U.S. dropped by 6.25, meanwhile 36% of workers reported switching to remote work arrangements. In this paper, we examine implications of these changes for the time allocation of different households, and on aggregate. We estimate that home production activity increased by 2.65 h a week, or 42.4% of lost market hours, due to the drop in market work and rise in remote work. The monthly value of home production increased by $39.65 billion - that is 13.55% of the concurrent $292.61 billion drop in monthly GDP. Although market hours declined the most for single, less educated individuals, the lost market hours were absorbed into home production the most by married individuals with children. Adding on the impact of school closures, our estimate of weekly home production hours increases by as much as 4.92 h. The increase in the value of monthly home production between February and April updates to $73.57 billion.

With the abrupt shutdown of face-to-face teaching caused by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, a case-based online training program integrating audio and video of real patients was developed. Methods: The blended learning platform CaseTrain guides medical students in their final year through real child-psychiatric patient cases, such as anorexia, autism, or attention deficit disorder, through presentation of video and audio of real patients and parents. The teaching format complements lectures on child psychiatric topics, comprising asynchronous elements (self-study using the digital material) as well as synchronous elements (web-conferences with a specialist). Learning objectives for students were set to develop knowledge of the spectra of psychiatric disorders that affect children and to recognize approaches how to assess and manage common psychiatric problems of childhood and adolescence. Results: The feedback from medical students through oral and written evaluation was positive. They appreciated getting to know 'real-world patients' in times of such a pandemic, to learn explorative techniques from role models, and to be in close contact with the supervising specialist. In consequence of critical feedback on the length of some video sequences, these training units will undergo revision. Conclusions: Case-based online training may continue to be a useful option in a post-pandemic future as integral part of medical education, complementing face-to-face lectures and training in (child) psychiatry.","Taurines, Regina; Radtke, Franziska; Romanos, Marcel; König, Sarah",GMS J Med Educ,,466

The development of vaccines and medicines is costly and time consuming. Thus, the development of novel materials and technologies to decrease viral availability, viability, infectivity, and to improve therapeutic outcomes can positively impact the prevention and treatment of viral diseases. METHODS: Herein, we discuss (a) interaction mechanisms between viruses and materials, (b) novel strategies to develop materials with antiviral properties and oral antiviral delivery systems, and (c) the potential of artificial intelligence to design and optimize preventive measures and therapeutic regimen. RESULTS: The mechanisms of viral adsorption on surfaces are well characterized but no major breakthrough has become clinically available. Materials with fine-tuned physical and chemical properties have the potential to compromise viral availability and stability. Emerging strategies using oral antiviral delivery systems and artificial intelligence can decrease infectivity and improve antiviral therapies. SIGNIFICANCE: Emerging viral infections are concerning due to risk of mortality, as well as psychological and economic impacts. Materials science emerges for the development of novel materials and technologies to diminish viral availability, infectivity, and to enable enhanced preventive and therapeutic strategies, for the safety and well-being of humankind.","Rosa, Vinicius; Ho, Dean; Sabino-Silva, Robinson; Siqueira, Walter L; Silikas, Nikolaos",Dent. mater,,466

222954,[Standard procedures in dialysis during the Covid-19 epidemic],2020,"Coronaviruses express a multifunctional papain-like protease, termed papain-like protease 2 (PLP2). PLP2 acts as a protease that cleaves the viral replicase polyprotein and as a deubiquitinating (DUB) enzyme which removes ubiquitin (Ub) moieties from ubiquitin-conjugated proteins. Previous in vitro studies implicated PLP2/DUB activity as a negative regulator of the host interferon (IFN) response, but the role of DUB activity during virus infection was unknown. Here, we used X-ray structure-guided mutagenesis and functional studies to identify amino acid substitutions within the ubiquitin-binding surface of PLP2 that reduced DUB activity without affecting polyprotein processing activity. We engineered a DUB mutation (Asp1772 to Ala) into a murine coronavirus and evaluated the replication and pathogenesis of the DUB mutant virus (DUBmut) in cultured macrophages and in mice. We found that the DUBmut virus replicates similarly to the wild-type (WT) virus in cultured cells, but the DUBmut virus activates an IFN response at earlier times compared to the wild-type virus infection in macrophages, consistent with DUB activity negatively regulating the IFN response. We compared the pathogenesis of the DUBmut virus to that of the wild-type virus and found that the DUBmut-infected mice had a statistically significant reduction (P < 0.05) in viral titer in liver and spleen at day 5 postinfection (d p.i.), although both wild-type and DUBmut virus infections resulted in similar liver pathology. Overall, this study demonstrates that structure-guided mutagenesis aids the identification of critical determinants of the PLP2-ubiquitin complex and that PLP2/DUB activity plays a role as an interferon antagonist in coronavirus pathogenesis.IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses employ a genetic economy by encoding multifunctional proteins that function in viral replication and also modify the host environment to disarm the innate immune response. The coronavirus papain-like protease 2 (PLP2) domain possesses protease activity, which cleaves the viral replicase polyprotein, and also DUB activity (deconjugating ubiquitin/ubiquitin-like molecules from modified substrates) using identical catalytic residues. To separate the DUB activity from the protease activity, we employed a structure-guided mutagenesis approach and identified residues that are important for ubiquitin binding. We found that mutating the ubiquitin-binding residues results in a PLP2 that has reduced DUB activity but retains protease activity. We engineered a recombinant murine coronavirus to express the DUB mutant and showed that the DUB mutant virus activated an earlier type I interferon response in macrophages and exhibited reduced replication in mice. The results of this study demonstrate that PLP2/DUB is an interferon antagonist and a virulence trait of coronaviruses.","Deng, Xufang; Chen, Yafang; Mielech, Anna M; Hackbart, Matthew; Kesely, Kristina R; Mettelman, Robert C; O039,; Brien, Amornrat; Chapman, Mackenzie E; Mesecar, Andrew D; Baker, Susan C",J. virol,,466

226421,Ruang Belajar Baru Dan Implikasi Terhadap Pembelajaran Di Era Tatanan Baru,2020,"We present a new approach to describe statistics of the non-linear matter density field that exploits a degeneracy in the impact of different cosmological parameters on the linear matter power spectrum, $P_{\rm L}(k)$, when expressed in Mpc units. We classify all cosmological parameters into two groups, shape parameters, which determine the shape of $P_{\rm L}(k)$, and evolution parameters, which only affect its amplitude at any given redshift. We show that the time evolution of $P_{\rm L}(k)$ in models with identical shape parameters but different evolution parameters can be mapped from one to the other by relabelling the redshifts that correspond to the same values of $\sigma_{12}(z)$, defined as the RMS linear variance in spheres of radius $12\,{\rm Mpc}$. We use N-body simulations to show that the same evolution mapping relation can be applied to the non-linear power spectrum, the halo mass function, or the full density field with high accuracy. The deviations from the exact degeneracy are the result of the different structure formation histories experienced by each model to reach the same value of $\sigma_{12}(z)$. This relation can be used to drastically reduce the number of parameters required to describe the cosmology dependence of the power spectrum. We show how this degeneracy can be exploited to speed up the inference of parameter constraints from cosmological observations. We also present a new design of an emulator of the non-linear power spectrum whose predictions can be adapted to an arbitrary choice of evolution parameters and redshift.","Sanchez, Ariel G.; Ruiz, Andr'es N.; Jara, Jenny Gonzalez; Padilla, Nelson D.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.12710v1.pdf,466
227812,COVID and the impact on higher education: The essential role of integrity and accountability,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence, characteristics, and risk factors of pulmonary embolism (PE) among patients hospitalized for COVID-19. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a prospective observational study of a randomly selected cohort of consecutive patients hospitalized for COVID-19 infection between March 8, 2020 through April 25, 2020. All eligible patients underwent a computed tomography pulmonary angiography independently of their PE clinical suspicion and were pre-screened for a baseline elevated D-dimer level. RESULTS: 119 patients were randomly selected from the 372 admitted to one tertiary hospital in Valencia (Spain) for COVID-19 infection during the period of study. Seventy-three patients fulfilled both the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria and were finally included in the study. Despite a high level of pharmacological thromboprophylaxis (89%), the incidence of PE was 35.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 29.6 to 41.6%), mostly with a peripheral location and low thrombotic load (Qanadli score 18.5%). Multivariate analysis showed that heart rate (Hazard Ratio [HR], 1.04), room-air oxygen saturation (spO2) (HR, 0.87), D-dimer (HR, 1.02), and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels (HR, 1.01) at the time of admission were independent predictors of incident PE during hospitalization. A risk score was constructed with these four variables showing a high predictive value of incident PE (AUC-ROC: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.80 to 0.93). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings confirmed a high incidence of PE in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Heart rate, spO2, D-dimer, and CRP levels at admission were associated with higher rates of PE during hospitalization.","García-Ortega, Alberto; Oscullo, Grace; Calvillo, Pilar; López-Reyes, Raquel; Méndez, Raúl; Gómez-Olivas, José Daniel; Bekki, Amina; Fonfría, Carles; Trilles-Olaso, Laura; Zaldívar, Enrique; Ferrando, Ana; Anguera, Gabriel; Briones-Gómez, Andrés; Reig-Mezquida, Juan Pablo; Feced, Laura; González-Jiménez, Paula; Reyes, Soledad; Muñoz-Núñez, Carlos F; Carreres, Ainhoa; Gil, Ricardo; Morata, Carmen; Toledo-Pons, Nuria; Martí-Bonmati, Luis; Menéndez, Rosario; Martínez-García, Miguel Ángel",J Infect,,466
228309,Antivirals in the time of COVID-19 - not as easy as it looks!,2020,"ß-coronavirus (CoVs) alone has been responsible for three major global outbreaks in the 21st century. The current crisis has led to an urgent requirement to develop therapeutics. Even though a number of vaccines are available, alternative strategies targeting essential viral components are required as a backup against the emergence of lethal viral variants. One such target is the main protease (Mpro) that plays an indispensable role in viral replication. The availability of over 270 Mpro X-ray structures in complex with inhibitors provides unique insights into ligand-protein interactions. Herein, we provide a comprehensive comparison of all nonredundant ligand-binding sites available for SARS-CoV2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV Mpro. Extensive adaptive sampling has been used to investigate structural conservation of ligand-binding sites using Markov state models (MSMs) and compare conformational dynamics employing convolutional variational auto-encoder-based deep learning. Our results indicate that not all ligand-binding sites are dynamically conserved despite high sequence and structural conservation across ß-CoV homologs. This highlights the complexity in targeting all three Mpro enzymes with a single pan inhibitor.","Cho, Eunice; Rosa, Margarida; Anjum, Ruhi; Mehmood, Saman; Soban, Mariya; Mujtaba, Moniza; Bux, Khair; Moin, Syed T; Tanweer, Mohammad; Dantu, Sarath; Pandini, Alessandro; Yin, Junqi; Ma, Heng; Ramanathan, Arvind; Islam, Barira; Mey, Antonia S J S; Bhowmik, Debsindhu; Haider, Shozeb",J Chem Inf Model,,466

Lung ultrasound (LUS) use has been proposed to identify suspected COVID-19 patients and direct them to the isolation area in the emergency department (ED) or to discharge them for outpatient treatment. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to retrospectively investigate the use of LUS in the ED to identify COVID-19 pneumonia (CP). METHODS: We performed a retrospective single-center study including all patients accessing the ED who underwent LUS examination for suspicion of COVID-19 during the initial outbreak. Demographics, clinical parameters, laboratory values, imaging features, and outcome variables were collected. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to evaluate diagnostic accuracy. RESULTS: A total of 41% patients were COVID-19-positive; 67% of them were diagnosed with CP. The ROC curve of the LUS score showed an area under the curve of 0.837 (95% CI 0.75-0.92) and with a cutoff value &#8805;3 identified 28 of 31 patients with CP and 11 of 15 without (sensitivity 90%, 95% CI 74-97%; specificity 75%, 95% CI 56-76%). LUS in combination with nasopharyngeal swab has a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI 74-97%) and a specificity of 61% (95% CI 44-67%). CONCLUSIONS: LUS is a promising technique for early identification of CP in patients who accessed the ED in an active epidemic time. The LUS score shows a sensitivity of 90% for CP, allowing to quickly direct patients with COVID-19 to the ED isolation area or to discharge them for outpatient treatment.","Zanforlin, Alessandro; Strapazzon, Giacomo; Falk, Markus; Gallina, Valentina; Viteritti, Antonio; Valzolgher, Laura; La Guardia, Mario; Ferro, Federica; Pagani, Leonardo; Vezzali, Norberto",Respiration,,466

However, asthma has not been suggested to be a risk factor in COVID-19 patients. Therefore, in asthmatic patients some potential protective mechanisms against SARS-COV-2 have been hypothesized, like type 2 immune response, number of eosinophils, overproduction of mucus, and asthma treatment, along with behavioral factors not strictly related to asthma, such as social distancing, hygiene measures and wearing facemasks, that contribute to reduce the individual susceptibility to SARS-COV-2 infection.

A 22-item survey was administered to 229 volunteers in the St. Louis region who tutor children through the Oasis Intergenerational Tutoring program. Although most respondents are familiar with technology and expressed that they are likely to volunteer virtually, their responses varied significantly by age, education, gender, income, and school districts. Some tutors expressed that virtual volunteering may eliminate barriers to in-person volunteering, while others were concerned with establishing a personal connection with students online. These findings suggest that tutors anticipate both benefits and challenges with virtual volunteering and that efforts to engage older adults during the pandemic should factor in prior use of technology and ensure that different subgroups are not marginalized.","Sun, Peter C; Morrow-Howell, Nancy; Pawloski, Elizabeth; Helbach, Alexander",J Appl Gerontol,,466

It is unknown the immediate impact of social restriction recommendations (i.e., lockdown, stay-at-home) on the life-space mobility of older people. Objective: To investigate the immediate impact of COVID-19 pandemic on life-space mobility of community-dwelling Brazilian older adults and examine the social determinants of health associated with change in life-space mobility. Design: Baseline data from a prospective cohort study (REMOBILIZE Study). Setting: Community. Subject: A convenience snowball sample of participants aged 60 and older (n = 1,482) living in 22 states in Brazil. Methods: We conducted an online and phone survey using an adapted version of the Life-Space Assessment (LSA). Linear regression models were used to investigate social determinants of health on the change in LSA score. Results: Regardless of their gender and social determinants of health, participants showed a significant reduction in life-space mobility since COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. Life-space mobility reduction was higher among black individuals, those living alone and aged between 70 and 79. Other variables associated with change in life-space mobility, to a lesser extent, were sex, education and income. Conclusion: Social restriction measures due to pandemic caused substantial reduction in older adults' life-space mobility in Brazil. Social inequalities strongly affected vulnerable groups. Concerted actions should be put in place to overcome the deterioration in life-pace mobility amongst these groups. Failure in minimizing health inequalities amplified by the pandemic may jeopardize the desired achievements of the Decade of Healthy Aging.","Perracini, Monica R; de Amorim, Juleimar Soares Coelho; Lima, Camila Astolphi; da Silva, Alexandre; Trombini-Souza, Francis; Pereira, Daniele Sirineu; Pelicioni, Paulo Henrique Silva; Duim, Etiene; Batista, Patricia Parreira; Dos Santos, Renato Barbosa; de Lima, Maria do Carmo Correia",Front Public Health,,466

Drugs that combat viral infections are called antiviral drugs. Viruses are among the major pathogenic agents that cause number of serious diseases in humans, animals and plants. Viruses cause many diseases in humans, from self resolving diseases to acute fatal diseases. Developing strategies for the antiviral drugs are focused on two different approaches: Targeting the viruses themselves or the host cell factors. Antiviral drugs that directly target the viruses include the inhibitors of virus attachment, inhibitors of virus entry, uncoating inhibitors, polymerase inhibitors, protease inhibitors, inhibitors of nucleoside and nucleotide reverse transcriptase and the inhibitors of integrase. The inhibitors of protease (ritonavir, atazanavir and darunavir), viral DNA polymerase (acyclovir, tenofovir, valganciclovir and valacyclovir) and of integrase (raltegravir) are listed among the Top 200 Drugs by sales during 2010s. Still no effective antiviral drugs are available for many viral infections. Though, there are a couple of drugs for herpesviruses, many for influenza and some new antiviral drugs for treating hepatitis C infection and HIV. Action mechanism of antiviral drugs consists of its transformation to triphosphate following the viral DNA synthesis inhibition. An analysis of the action mechanism of known antiviral drugs concluded that they can increase the cell's resistance to a virus (interferons), suppress the virus adsorption in the cell or its diffusion into the cell and its deproteinisation process in the cell (amantadine) along with antimetabolites that causes the inhibition of nucleic acids synthesis. This review will address currently used antiviral drugs, mechanism of action and antiviral agents reported against COVID-19.","Kausar, Shamaila; Said Khan, Fahad; Ishaq Mujeeb Ur Rehman, Muhammad; Akram, Muhammad; Riaz, Muhammad; Rasool, Ghulam; Hamid Khan, Abdul; Saleem, Iqra; Shamim, Saba; Malik, Arif",Int J Immunopathol Pharmacol,,466

Objectives: This study aimed to determine the spectrum of kidney diseases in pediatric patients with COVID-19, admitted to a tertiary children's hospital. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 71 pediatric patients with COVID-19 infection. Diagnosis of COVID-19 was established basedonthe guidelinesby the Iranian Ministry of Health. The patients' demographiccharacteristics, clinicalsymptoms, laboratory results, and renal ultrasonography findings were extracted from the hospital medical records. Results: On admission, 10% of patients had oliguria, 7.7% had edema, and 3% had hypertension. The first urinalysis indicated proteinuria, leukocyturia, and hematuria in 46%, 24%, and 23% of the patients, respectively. Overall, 40.7% of the patients showed some degree of renal involvement. During hospitalization, acute kidney injury (AKI) occurred in 34.5% of the patients. Based on the pediatric risk, injury, failure, loss of kidney function, and end-stage kidney disease (pRIFLE) classification, stage I (risk group) was found in 20% of patients, stage II (injury group) in 25% of patients, and stage III (failure group) in 55% of patients with AKI. The total mortality rate was estimated at 12.67%, and the incidence of in-hospital death was 30% in pediatric patients with severe COVID-19 infection associated with AKI. Conclusions: The prevalence of AKI was high in patients with COVID-19 infection hospitalized in our tertiary hospital. We also found that a decrease in renal function was associated with a higher risk of mortality. Overall, early detection of AKI and effective treatment may help reduce mortality in patients with COVID-19.","Mohkam, M.; Mirzaee, M.; Gorgi, F. A.; Tabatabaei, S.

282453,Mass masking: an alternative to a second lockdown in Aotearoa,2020,"Organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP)1B induction is an evolving mechanism of drug disposition and interaction. However, there are contradictory reports describing OATP1B expression in hepatocytes and liver biopsies after administration of an inducer. This study investigated the in vivo effects of the common inducer rifampin (RIF) on the activity and expression of cynomolgus monkey OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 transporters, which are structurally and functionally similar their human OATP1B counterparts. Multiple doses of oral RIF (15 mg/kg) resulted in a steady 3.9-fold increase of CYP3A biomarker, 4ß-hydroxycholesterol (4ßHC), in the plasma samples collected before each RIF dose during the treatment period (i.e., predose). In contrast, the predose plasma levels of OATP1B biomarkers coproporphyrin (CP) I and CPIII did not change when compared to RIF treatment. The trough concentration, AUC, and half-life of RIF decreased markedly during RIF treatment, suggesting that RIF induced its own clearance. Consequently, RIF treatment increased CPI and CPIII AUCs substantially after a single administration and, to a lesser extent, after multiple administrations, compared to pre-administration AUCs. In addition, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 mRNA expressions were not modulated by RIF treatment (0.85- to 1.3-fold) whereas CYP3A8 expression was increased 3.7- to 5.0-fold, which correlated well with the predose levels of CP and 4ßHC. Rifampin treatment showed 2.0- to 3.3-fold increases in P-gp, BCRP, and MRP2 expression in the small intestine. Collectively, these findings indicate that monkey OATP1B and OATP1B3 are not induced by RIF and further investigation of OATP1B induction by RIF and other nuclear receptor activators in humans is warranted. Significance Statement In this study, combined endogenous biomarker and gene expression data suggested that RIF did not induce OATP1B in cynomolgus monkeys. For the first time, the study determines transporter gene expression in the nonhuman primate liver, gut, and kidney tissues following administration of RIF for 7 days, leading to a better understanding of the induction of OATP1B and other major drug transporters. Finally, it provides evidence to strengthen the claim that CP is a suitable endogenous probes of OATP1B activity.","Zhang, Yueping; Chen, Cliff; Chen, Shen-Jue; Chen, Xue-Qing; Shuster, David J; Puszczalo, Pawel D; Fancher, R Marcus; Yang, Zheng; Sinz, Michael; Shen, Hong",J. pharmacol. exp. ther,,466

In this paper, we develop an inferential method based on ideas from conformal prediction, which can wrap around any survival prediction algorithm to produce calibrated, covariate-dependent lower predictive bounds on survival times. In the Type I right-censoring setting, when the censoring times are completely exogenous, the lower predictive bounds have guaranteed coverage in finite samples without any assumptions other than that of operating on independent and identically distributed data points. Under a more general conditionally independent censoring assumption, the bounds satisfy a doubly robust property which states the following: marginal coverage is approximately guaranteed if either the censoring mechanism or the conditional survival function is estimated well. Further, we demonstrate that the lower predictive bounds remain valid and informative for other types of censoring. The validity and efficiency of our procedure are demonstrated on synthetic data and real COVID-19 data from the UK Biobank.","Candes, Emmanuel J.; Lei, Lihua; Ren, Zhimei",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.09763v1.pdf,466

AIM: We aimed to identify the activities respondents found beneficial for their well-being and mental health and recorded a mood score from survey respondents. METHODS: A nationwide study was completed to investigate the mental health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic upon medical students and newly qualified doctors (interim foundation year one). We received 2075 respondents from across the UK. RESULTS: Physical activity was found to be the most common activity used by the survey respondents to help with their mental well-being (80.1%) (medical students, 83.7%; interim foundation doctors, 72.3%). Participants who stated that exercise helped their well-being had a mean score (SD) of 52.3 (20.7) which was significantly higher (P = 0.048) than those who reported that they did not exercise (49.8 (21.1)). Respondents who stated they had used exercise to help with their mental well-being had (on average) a higher mood score than those who did not. This was seen in both the medical student and interim foundation doctor subgroups. DISCUSSION: Exercise can help to benefit the well-being of medical students and interim foundation doctors.

A web-based questionnaire survey was conducted in a cross-sectional design in three groups of participants: (1.) patients with RD, (2.) hospital workers, and (3.) high-school teachers/academic staff. Psychiatric status was evaluated using Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and Impact of Event Scale-Revised scale. Overall response rate was 34.7%. We studied 771 patients with RD, 535 hospital workers, and 917 teachers/academic staff. Most of the patients with RD were unwilling to go to the hospital (86%), while 22% discontinued their medications. Biological DMARDS were the most frequent drugs whose doses were altered. Only 4% were willing to take hydroxychloroquine for protection. Moreover, the frequency of anxiety (20%), depression (43%), and post-traumatic stress (28%) among patients with RD were found to be comparable to that found among the teachers/academic staff (23%, 43% and 29%, respectively), whereas significantly less than that observed among the hospital workers (40%, 62%, and 46%, respectively) (p < 0.001). Female gender, use of social media, having a comorbid disease, or a psychiatric disorder were found to be independently associated with psychiatric symptoms in total study population. The majority of the patients were unwilling to attend outpatient visits and one-fifth skipped or stopped their immunosuppressive agents. Psychiatric symptoms in patient's and teacher's populations were of considerable clinical concern, despite being significantly lower than that observed among the hospital workers.","Seyahi, Emire; Poyraz, Burc Cagri; Sut, Necdet; Akdogan, Selma; Hamuryudan, Vedat",Rheumatol Int,,466

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the changes in musculoskeletal problems and psychosocial status of teachers during the COVID-19 pandemic due to online education and to investigate the effects of preventive telerehabilitation applications for musculoskeletal problems. METHODS: Forty teachers who conducted online education during the pandemic volunteered to participate in the study. All assessments were performed via online methods. The Cornell Musculoskeletal Discomfort Questionnaire (CMDQ), ProFitMap-Neck questionnaire, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), and Upper Extremity Functional Index (UEFI) were used to evaluate musculoskeletal problems; the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) were used to evaluate anxiety and depression, respectively; and the Work-Life Balance Scale (WLBS) was used to evaluate how well individuals achieve this balance. Information about before online education, during online education, and after training was obtained with the assessments. After the first assessment, telerehabilitation, which involved presentations and brochures, was applied to 18 participants willing to participate in the training. RESULTS: The ProFitMap, UEFI, and WLBS scores during the online education decreased significantly, while the scores of the CMDQ, ODI, BDI, and BAI during the online education increased significantly compared to the pre-online education scores (pâ< â0.05). In addition, the total CMDQ, ProFitMap, and ODI scores improved significantly after the training (pâ< â0.05).

The subjects of this cross-sectional study were people interested in the Osekkai conference (control group) and those actively involved in Osekkai activities (exposure group). The primary outcome of social participation was measured as the frequency of meeting and the number of friends or acquaintances. The demographic data of the participants and process outcomes were measured using a questionnaire provided to all 287 registered participants. The effective response rate was 64.5% (185 responses). The involvement in Osekkai conferences was statistically associated with a high frequency and number of meetings with friends or acquaintances (p < 0.001 and 0.048, respectively). A health check was significantly associated with the number of friends or acquaintances met in the previous month, while high social support was significantly associated with loneliness. Thus, we confirm that Osekkai contributes to high social participation, although we see no relationship with loneliness. Future studies should investigate this cause-and-effect relationship and promote culturally sensitive activities to improve social and health outcomes in rural Japan.","Ohta, Ryuichi; Yata, Akiko; Arakawa, Yuki; Maiguma, Koichi; Sano, Chiaki",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,466

It becomes the most unprecedent challenge to analytic epidemiology in general and signal processing theories in specific. Given its high contingency nature and adverse effects across the world, it is important to develop efficient processing/learning models to overcome this pandemic and be prepared for potential future ones. In this regard, medical imaging plays an important role for the management of COVID-19. Human-centered interpretation of medical images is, however, tedious and can be subjective. This has resulted in a surge of interest to develop Radiomics models for analysis and interpretation of medical images. Signal Processing (SP) and Deep Learning (DL) models can assist in development of robust Radiomics solutions for diagnosis/prognosis, severity assessment, treatment response, and monitoring of COVID-19 patients. In this article, we aim to present an overview of the current state, challenges, and opportunities of developing SP/DL-empowered models for diagnosis (screening/monitoring) and prognosis (outcome prediction and severity assessment) of COVID-19 infection. More specifically, the article starts by elaborating the latest development on the theoretical framework of analytic epidemiology and hypersignal processing for COVID-19. Afterwards, imaging modalities and Radiological characteristics of COVID-19 are discussed. SL/DL-based Radiomic models specific to the analysis of COVID-19 infection are then described covering the following four domains: Segmentation of COVID-19 lesions; Predictive models for outcome prediction; Severity assessment, and; Diagnosis/classification models.

Alternative to the traditional disease surveillance data collected by the United States (US) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), big data from Internet such as online search volumes has been previously shown to contain valuable information for tracking infectious disease dynamics. In this study, we evaluate the feasibility of using Internet search volume of relevant queries to track and predict COVID-19 pandemic. We found strong association between COVID-19 death trend and the search volume of symptom-related queries such as""loss of taste"". Then, we further develop an influenza-tracking model to predict future 2-week COVID-19 deaths on the US national level, by combining search volume information with COVID-19 time series information. Encouraged by the 45% error reduction on national level comparing to the baseline time series model, we additionally build state-level COVID-19 deaths models, leveraging the cross-state cross-resolution spatial temporal framework that pools information from search volume and COVID-19 reports across states, regions and the nation. These variants of ARGOX are then aggregated in a winner-takes-all ensemble fashion to produce the final state-level 2-week forecasts. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our method steadily outperforms time series baseline models, and achieves the state-of-the-art performance among the publicly available benchmark models. Overall, we show that disease dynamics and relevant public search behaviors co-evolve during the COVID-19 pandemic, and capturing their dependencies while leveraging historical cases/deaths as well as spatial-temporal cross-region information will enable stable and accurate US national and state-level forecasts.","Ma, Simin; Yang, Shihao",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.12160v1.pdf,466

This has resulted in an inability to care for patients with valvular and structural heart disease in a timely fashion, potentially placing these patients at increased risk for adverse cardiovascular complications, including CHF and death. The effective triage of these patients has become challenging in the current environment as clinicians have had to weigh the risk of bringing susceptible patients into the hospital environment during the COVID-19 pandemic against the risk of delaying a needed procedure. In this document, the authors suggest guidelines for how to triage patients in need of structural heart disease interventions and provide a framework for how to decide when it may be appropriate to proceed with intervention despite the ongoing pandemic. In particular, the authors address the triage of patients in need of transcatheter aortic valve replacement and percutaneous mitral valve repair.

Additional ""checklist-negative"" decedents were randomly tested daily. Lung slides were blindly reviewed by 3 pathologists, assessing for the presence of diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and other findings. Sixteen decedents had positive postmortem SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swabs and underwent complete autopsies. Seven decedents had positive screening checklists. Of these, 4 had DAD and 1 had COVID-19-associated thromboembolic disease. Of the 9 decedents with negative screening checklists, 2 had DAD, but only 1 was attributed to COVID-19; the other was likely drug related. Acute bronchopneumonia was the second most common finding, and aspiration was the likely etiology in cases without concomitant DAD. COVID-19-related DAD was identified more commonly in decedents who screened positive by CDC checklist, but false-negatives did occur.

321064,Hospitality managers in turbulent times: the COVID-19 crisis,2021,"Modern psychological theories postulate that individual differences in prejudice are determined by social and ideological attitudes instead of personality. For example, the dual-process motivational (DPM) model argues that personality does not directly associate with prejudice when controlling for the attitudinal variables that capture the authoritarian-conservatism motivation and the dominance motivation. Previous studies testing the DPM model largely relied on convenience samples and/or European samples, and have produced inconsistent results. Here we examined the extent to which anti-black prejudice was associated with the Big Five personality traits and social and ideological attitudes (authoritarianism, social dominance orientation, political party affiliation) in two large probability samples of the general population (N1 = 3,132; N2 = 2,483) from the American National Election Studies (ANES). We performed structural equation modeling (SEM) to test the causal assumptions between the latent variables and used survey weights to generate estimates that were representative of the population. Different from prior theories, across both datasets we found that two personality traits, agreeableness and conscientiousness, were directly associated with anti-black prejudice when controlling for authoritarianism, social dominance orientation, and political party affiliation. We also found that a substantial part of the associations between personality traits and anti-black prejudice were mediated through those social and ideological attitudes, which might serve as candidates for prejudice-reduction interventions in the real world.","Lin, Chujun; Alvarez, R Michael",PLoS One,,466

323798,How should a positive PCR test result for COVID-19 in an asymptomatic individual be interpreted and managed?,2020,"Antibodies are versatile proteins that bind to pathogens like viruses and stimulate the adaptive immune system. The specificity of antibody binding is determined by complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) at the tips of these Y-shaped proteins. In this paper, we propose a generative model to automatically design the CDRs of antibodies with enhanced binding specificity or neutralization capabilities. Previous generative approaches formulate protein design as a structure-conditioned sequence generation task, assuming the desired 3D structure is given a priori. In contrast, we propose to co-design the sequence and 3D structure of CDRs as graphs. Our model unravels a sequence autoregressively while iteratively refining its predicted global structure. The inferred structure in turn guides subsequent residue choices. For efficiency, we model the conditional dependence between residues inside and outside of a CDR in a coarse-grained manner. Our method achieves superior log-likelihood on the test set and outperforms previous baselines in designing antibodies capable of neutralizing the SARS-CoV-2 virus.","Jin, Wengong; Wohlwend, Jeremy; Barzilay, Regina; Jaakkola, Tommi",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.04624v1.pdf,466

Identifiability analysis determines how well the parameters of a model can be estimated from experimental data. Identifiability analysis is crucial for interpreting and determining confidence in model parameter values and to provide biologically relevant predictions. Structural identifiability analysis, in which one assumes data to be noiseless and arbitrarily fine-grained, has been extensively studied in the context of ordinary differential equation (ODE) models, but has not yet been widely explored for age-structured partial differential equation (PDE) models. These models present additional difficulties due to increased number of variables and partial derivatives as well as the presence of boundary conditions. In this work, we establish a pipeline for structural identifiability analysis of age-structured PDE models using a differential algebra framework and derive identifiability results for specific age-structured models. We use epidemic models to demonstrate this framework because of their wide-spread use in many different diseases and for the corresponding parallel work previously done for ODEs. In our application of the identifiability analysis pipeline, we focus on a Susceptible-Exposed-Infected model for which we compare identifiability results for a PDE and corresponding ODE system and explore effects of age-dependent parameters on identifiability. We also show how practical identifiability analysis can be applied in this example.","Renardy, Marissa; Kirschner, Denise; School, Marisa Eisenberg University of Michigan Medical; Microbiology, Department of; Immunology,; Michigan, University of; Epidemiology, Department of",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.06178v1.pdf,466

A highly effective transmission-blocking vaccine prioritized to adults ages 20 to 49 years minimized cumulative incidence, but mortality and years of life lost were minimized in most scenarios when the vaccine was prioritized to adults greater than 60 years old. Use of individual-level serological tests to redirect doses to seronegative individuals improved the marginal impact of each dose while potentially reducing existing inequities in COVID-19 impact. Although maximum impact prioritization strategies were broadly consistent across countries, transmission rates, vaccination rollout speeds, and estimates of naturally acquired immunity, this framework can be used to compare impacts of prioritization strategies across contexts.","Bubar, Kate M; Reinholt, Kyle; Kissler, Stephen M; Lipsitch, Marc; Cobey, Sarah; Grad, Yonatan H; Larremore, Daniel B",Science,,466

We investigated the nationwide effects of COVID-19 on the national Public-Private Mix (PPM) TB control project in Korea, using monitoring indicators from the Korean PPM monitoring database. METHODS: The Korean PPM monitoring database includes data from patients registered at PPM hospitals throughout the country. Data of six monitoring indicators for active TB cases updated between July 2019 and June 2020 were collected. The data of each cohort throughout the country and in Daegu-Gyeongbuk, Seoul Metropolitan Area, and Jeonnam-Jeonbuk were collated to provide nationwide data. The data were compared using the &#967;² test for trend to evaluate quarterly trends of each monitoring indicator at the national level and in the prespecified regions. RESULTS: Test coverages of sputum smear (P = 0.622) and culture (P = 0.815), drug susceptibility test (P = 0.750), and adherence rate to initial standard treatment (P = 0.901) at the national level were not significantly different during the study period. The rate of loss to follow-up among TB cases at the national level was not significantly different (P = 0.088); however, the treatment success rate among the smear-positive drug-susceptible pulmonary TB cohort at the national level significantly decreased, from 90.6% to 84.1% (P < 0.001). Treatment success rate in the Seoul metropolitan area also significantly decreased during the study period, from 89.4% to 84.5% (P = 0.006).

Current nursing home COVID-19 screening guidance includes assessment for fever, defined as a temperature of at least 38.0°C. The objective of this study was to describe the temperature changes before and after universal testing for SARS-CoV-2 in nursing home residents. DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: The Veterans Administration (VA) operates 134 Community Living Centers (CLC), similar to nursing homes, that house residents who cannot live independently. VA guidance to CLCs directed daily clinical screening for COVID-19 that included temperature assessment. MEASURES: All CLC residents (n = 7325) underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing. We report the temperature in the window of 14 days before and after universal SARS-CoV-2 testing among CLC residents. Baseline temperature was calculated for 5 days before the study window. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 was identified in 443 (6.0%) residents. The average maximum temperature in SARS-CoV-2-positive residents was 37.66 (0.69) compared with 37.11 (0.36) (P = .001) in SARS-CoV-2-negative residents. Temperatures in those with SARS-CoV-2 began rising 7 days before testing and remained elevated during the 14-day follow-up. Among SARS-CoV-2-positive residents, only 26.6% (n = 118) met the fever threshold of 38.0°C during the survey period. Most residents (62.5%, n = 277) with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 did experience 2 or more 0.5°C elevations above their baseline values. One cohort of SARS-CoV-2 residents' (20.3%, n = 90) temperatures never deviated >0.5°C from baseline. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: A single screening for temperature is unlikely to detect nursing home residents with SARS-CoV-2. Repeated temperature measurement with a patient-derived baseline can increase sensitivity. The current fever threshold as a screening criteria for SARS-CoV-2 infection should be reconsidered.","Rudolph, James L; Halladay, Christopher W; Barber, Malisa; McConeghy, Kevin W; Mor, Vince; Nanda, Aman; Gravenstein, Stefan",J Am Med Dir Assoc,,466

Their positions rely upon a set of studies and experience about outbreaks and transmission mechanisms in Africa as well as assumptions about what those studies imply about outbreaks in the US. According to this view the probability of a single infection is low and that of a major outbreak is non-existent. In a series of brief reports we will provide insight into why properties of networks of contagion that are not considered in traditional statistics suggest that risks are higher than those assumptions suggest. We begin with the difference between thin and fat tailed distributions applied to the number of infected individuals that can arise from a single one. Traditional epidemiological models consider the contagion process as described by $R_0$, the average number of new infected individuals arising from a single case. However, in a complex interdependent society it is possible for the actual number due to a single individual to dramatically differ from the average number, with severe consequences for the ability to contain an outbreak when it is just beginning. Our analysis raises doubts about the scientific validity of policy recommendations of public health authorities.

BACKGROUND: After coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak, front-line nurses embraced remarkable potential stress and huge workload when caring for coronavirus disease 2019 patients, which may lead to new challenges to work engagement. DESIGN: A large sample survey was conducted at the end of February 2020 in a designated hospital treating coronavirus disease 2019 patients in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei Province, in China. t Test, one-way ANOVA, chi-squared test, Pearson's correlation and hierarchical multiple regression were performed among 1,040 nurses using SPSS 24.0. The STROBE checklist was followed for observational studies. RESULTS: The final model interpreted 27.3% of the variance, of which each block could explain 11.7%, 10.3% and 7.9% R2 changes including sociodemographic characteristics, stress and workload, respectively. Work engagement was negatively correlated with stress and workload. The potential influencing factors included sociodemographic characteristics (married, rescue staff, cabin ward), stress (infection control, PPE discomfort) and workload (mental demand, performance, frustration). CONCLUSIONS: Front-line nurses perceived low stress and workload, but high work engagement, especially in self-dedication. However, infection control, PPE discomfort and frustration were negatively associated with nurses' work engagement, while mental demand and good performance were positively associated with nurses' work engagement. Future interventions focused on decreasing front-line staff's infection risk and enhancing their self-confidence may be recommendable to promote their work engagement.","Zhang, Meng; Zhang, Ping; Liu, Yu; Wang, Hui; Hu, Kaili; Du, Meichen",J Clin Nurs,,466

DESIGN: Test accuracy study. SETTING: Laboratory based evaluation. PARTICIPANTS: 2847 key workers (healthcare staff, fire and rescue officers, and police officers) in England in June 2020 (268 with a previous polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive result (median 63 days previously), 2579 with unknown previous infection status); and 1995 pre-pandemic blood donors. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: AbC-19 sensitivity and specificity, estimated using known negative (pre-pandemic) and known positive (PCR confirmed) samples as reference standards and secondly using the Roche Elecsys anti-nucleoprotein assay, a highly sensitive laboratory immunoassay, as a reference standard in samples from key workers. RESULTS: Test result bands were often weak, with positive/negative discordance by three trained laboratory staff for 3.9% of devices. Using consensus readings, for known positive and negative samples sensitivity was 92.5% (95% confidence interval 88.8% to 95.1%) and specificity was 97.9% (97.2% to 98.4%). Using an immunoassay reference standard, sensitivity was 94.2% (90.7% to 96.5%) among PCR confirmed cases but 84.7% (80.6% to 88.1%) among other people with antibodies. This is consistent with AbC-19 being more sensitive when antibody concentrations are higher, as people with PCR confirmation tended to have more severe disease whereas only 62% (218/354) of seropositive participants had had symptoms. If 1 million key workers were tested with AbC-19 and 10% had actually been previously infected, 84 700 true positive and 18 900 false positive results would be projected. The probability that a positive result was correct would be 81.7% (76.8% to 85.8%). CONCLUSIONS: AbC-19 sensitivity was lower among unselected populations than among PCR confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2, highlighting the scope for overestimation of assay performance in studies involving only PCR confirmed cases, owing to ""spectrum bias."" Assuming that 10% of the tested population have had SARS-CoV-2 infection, around one in five key workers testing positive with AbC-19 would be false positives.

347901,African tourism and air transport: the role of the African Union and ECOSOCC in SDG implementation post COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Methylprednisolone has been used for acute respiratory distress syndrome with variable results. Veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation use in acute respiratory distress syndrome has increased. Occasionally, both are used. We hypothesized that methylprednisolone could improve lung compliance and ease weaning from extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in acute respiratory distress syndrome patients. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed all patients in our veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation unit treated with methylprednisolone over a 20 month period. Methylprednisolone was initiated for inability to wean off veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Dynamic compliance (Cdyn) was calculated at cannulation, methylprednisolone initiation, and decannulation. Demographics, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation-specific data, and ventilator data were collected. Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to test for differences in dynamic compliance. RESULTS: A total of 12 veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation patients received methylprednisolone. Mean age was 50 (±15) years. Seven had influenza. Methylprednisolone was started on median Day 16 (interquartile range: 11-22) of veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. In total, 10 patients had veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation decannulation on median Day 12 (7-22) after methylprednisolone initiation. Two patients died before decannulation. The 10 decannulated patients had initial median dynamic compliance (mL × cm H2O-1) of 12 (7-23), then 16 (10-24) at methylprednisolone initiation, and then 44 (34-60) at decannulation. Dynamic compliance was higher at decannulation than methylprednisolone initiation (p = 0.002), and unchanged from cannulation to methylprednisolone initiation for all patients (p = 0.97). A total of 10 patients had significant infections. None had significant gastrointestinal bleed or wound healing issues. CONCLUSION: Methylprednisolone may be associated with improved compliance in acute respiratory distress syndrome allowing for decannulation from veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. High rates of infection are associated with methylprednisolone use in veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Further studies are required to identify appropriate patient selection for methylprednisolone use in patients on veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.","Tabatabai, Ali; Menaker, Jay; Stene, Edward; Kufera, Joseph A; Rabinowitz, Ronald P; Kon, Zachary; Herr, Daniel L; Scalea, Thomas M",Perfusion,,466

349926,Les sages-femmes face à la crise sanitaire,2020,"Interleukin 6 (IL-6), which is involved in the cytokine storm phenomenon, is a therapeutic target in COVID-19, but monoclonal receptor antibody therapeutic agents such as tocilizumab have demonstrated mixed results. Could Vitamin D, which modulates IL-6, be more effective than currently deployed IL-6 antagonists, including tocilizumab, thereby presenting a useful therapeutic option in COVID-19? A narrative review of published trials examining the effect of Vitamin D administration in COVID-19 patients was conducted, and the theoretical basis for the use of tocilizumab as an IL-6 antagonist was compared with the immunomodulatory effect of Vitamin D on IL-6 production. Four of the six included studies reported a positive effect of Vitamin D on outcomes. While tocilizumab non-selectively blocks both anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory actions of IL-6, Vitamin D lowers immune cell IL-6 production, potentially reducing pro-inflammatory effects, but does not specifically target IL-6 receptors, avoiding any deleterious effect on the anti-inflammatory actions of IL-6. Vitamin D may have advantages over tocilizumab as an IL-6 immunomodulator, and, given that it is safe if administered under clinical supervision, there is a strong rationale for its use.","Silberstein, Morry",Eur J Pharmacol,,466

358448,COVID-19 – A window of opportunity for the transition toward sustainable mobility?,2021,"Given the pertinence and acceleration of the spread of COVID-19, there is an increased need for the replicability of data models to verify the veracity of models and visualize important data. Most of these visualizations lack reproducibility, credibility, or accuracy, and are static, which makes it difficult to analyze the spread over time. Furthermore, most current visualizations depicting the spread of COVID-19 are at a global or country level, meaning there is a dearth of regional analysis within a country. Keeping these issues in mind, a replicable, efficient, and simple method to generate regional COVID-19 visualizations mapped with time was created by using the KNIME software, an open-source data analytics platform that can create user-friendly applications or workflows. For this analysis, Albania, Sweden, Ukraine, Denmark, Russia, India, and Australia were closely observed. Among the maps generated for the aforementioned countries, it was noticed that regions with a high population or high population density were often the epicenters within their respective country. The regions caused the virus to spread to their neighboring regions: kickstarting the ""domino effect"", leading to the infection of another region until the country is overwhelmed with cases-what we call a proximity trend. These dynamic maps are crucial to fighting the pandemic because they can provide insight as to how COVID-19 spreads by providing researchers or officials with an accurate and insightful tool to aid their analysis. By being able to visualize the spread, health and government officials can dive deeper to identify the sources of transmission and attempt to stop or reverse them accordingly.","Chintala, Srikar; Dutta, Ritvik; Tadmor, Doron",Infect Genet Evol,,466

Recent clinical data has highlighted that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with a significant risk of thrombotic complications ranging from microvascular thrombosis, venous thromboembolic disease, and stroke. Importantly, thrombotic complications are markers of severe COVID-19 and are associated with multiorgan failure and increased mortality. The evidence to date supports the concept that the thrombotic manifestations of severe COVID-19 are due to the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to invade endothelial cells via ACE-2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2), which is expressed on the endothelial cell surface. However, in patients with COVID-19 the subsequent endothelial inflammation, complement activation, thrombin generation, platelet, and leukocyte recruitment, and the initiation of innate and adaptive immune responses culminate in immunothrombosis, ultimately causing (micro)thrombotic complications, such as deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and stroke. Accordingly, the activation of coagulation (eg, as measured with plasma D-dimer) and thrombocytopenia have emerged as prognostic markers in COVID-19. Given thrombotic complications are central determinants of the high mortality rate in COVID-19, strategies to prevent thrombosis are of critical importance. Several antithrombotic drugs have been proposed as potential therapies to prevent COVID-19-associated thrombosis, including heparin, FXII inhibitors, fibrinolytic drugs, nafamostat, and dipyridamole, many of which also possess pleiotropic anti-inflammatory or antiviral effects. The growing awareness and mechanistic understanding of the prothrombotic state of COVID-19 patients are driving efforts to more stringent diagnostic screening for thrombotic complications and to the early institution of antithrombotic drugs, for both the prevention and therapy of thrombotic complications.

As such, several studies have screened FDA-approved drugs in silico at a limited number of classical antiviral sites for anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. We hypothesized that an extensive in-silico drug repurposingscreen against a wide range of SARS-COV-2 proteins could identify novel antiviral drugs and help elucidate mechanisms of drug action of hits from in vitro screens. We selected 48 known or predicted drug sites across 23 SARS-COV-2 proteins using homology models and crystal structures based on known antiviral drug sites (i.e., polymerase or protease active sites), computational predictions, and protein-protein interfaces. Then, using the software GOLD, we docked 1268 FDA-approved small-molecule drugs into each site. Virtual hits were prioritized based on their anti-SARS-COV-2 activity found in a recent phenotypic drug-repurposing screen using human huh-7 epithelial cells. This resulted in the identification of a range of drugs acting at a variety of targets and sites. Several compelling drug/site pairs were identified, including sites on the Spike protein, which mediates viral entry. For example, we identified hits with anti-SARS-CoV2 activity in vitro, at a putative allosteric site that incorporates two functionalities required for viral entry, namely the Spike S2? cleavage site ? which a host protease must cleave for viral entry, and the critical ?fusion peptide? domain ? which injects itself into the host membrane during viral entry.

METHODS: We investigated differences in clinical characteristics and outcomes of HMPV infections in hospitalized patients before (January 2016-28 February, 2020) and HMPV and COVID-19 during part of the COVID-19 pandemic (28 February, 2020-1 April, 2020). RESULTS: A total of 239 HMPV patients and 303 COVID-19 patients were included. Incidence of HMPV peaked in March. Despite a 324% increase in HMPV testing during the COVID-19 outbreak, incidence of HMPV remained stable. Clinical characteristics showed 25 (11%) ICU admissions and 14 (6%) deaths. History of myocardial infarction, higher age and lower BMI were independently associated with increased 30-day mortality. Clinical characteristics of HMPV-infected patients did not differ between the non-COVID-19 period and the examined COVID-19 period except for length of hospital stay (7 vs. 5 days). HMPV infection and COVID-19 shared many clinical features but HMPV was associated with female gender, elderly patients and chronic conditions (COPD and chronic heart failure). Clinical outcomes did not differ between the viruses during the COVID-19 period. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical impact of HMPV infection did not change during the COVID-19 outbreak in terms of incidence and/or disease severity; hence, HMPV and SARS-CoV-2 are probably co-circulating independently. Despite the current clinical focus on the COVID-19 pandemic, clinicians should keep in mind that HMPV-infection may mimic COVID-19 and is also associated with serious adverse outcomes.","Jongbloed, Mandy; Leijte, Wouter T; Linssen, Catharina F M; van den Hoogen, Bernadette G; van Gorp, Eric C M; de Kruif, Martijn D",Infect Dis (Lond),,466
367900,Trauma en pediatría,2002,"Quick identification and isolation of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals is central to managing the COVID-19 pandemic. Real time reverse transcriptase PCR (rRT-PCR) is the gold standard for COVID-19 diagnosis. However, this resource-intensive and relatively lengthy technique is not ideally suited for mass testing. While pooled testing offers substantial savings in cost and time, the size of the optimum pool that offers complete concordance with results of individualized testing remains elusive. To determine the optimum pool size, we first evaluated the utility of pool testing using simulated 5-sample pools with varying proportions of positive and negative samples. We observed that 5-sample pool testing resulted in false negativity rate of 5% when the pools contained one positive sample. We then examined the diagnostic performance of 4-sample pools in the operational setting of a diagnostic laboratory using 500 consecutive samples in 125 pools. With background prevalence of 2.4%, this 4-sample pool testing showed 100% concordance with individualized testing and resulted in 66% and 59% reduction in resource and turnaround time, respectively. Since the negative predictive value of a diagnostic test varies inversely with prevalence, we re-tested the 4-sample pooling strategy using a fresh batch of 500 samples in 125 pools when the prevalence rose to 12.7% and recorded 100% concordance and reduction in cost and turnaround time by 36% and 30%, respectively. These observations led us to conclude that 4-sample pool testing offers the optimal blend of resource optimization and diagnostic performance across difference disease prevalence settings.","Singh, Anirudh K; Nema, Ram Kumar; Joshi, Ankur; Shankar, Prem; Gupta, Sudheer; Yadav, Ashvini Kumar; Nema, Shashwati; Mathew, Bijina J; Shrivas, Arti; Patankar, Chitra; Raghuwanshi, Arun; Pandey, Ritu; Tripathi, Ranu; Ansari, Kudsia; Singh, Kuldeep; Yadav, Jogender; Biswas, Debasis; Singh, Sarman",PLoS One,,466
368015,[Covid-19 in patients on dialysis: infection prevention and control strategies],2020,"BACKGROUND: We aimed to compare the outcome of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients who received endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) with confirmed COVID-19 to those without. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis using the Vizient Clinical Data Base and included hospital discharges from April 1 to July 31 2020 with ICD-10 codes for AIS and EVT. The primary outcome was in-hospital death and the secondary outcome was favorable discharge, defined as discharge home or to acute rehabilitation. We compared patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 to those without. As a sensitivity analysis, we compared COVID-19 AIS patients who did not undergo EVT to those who did, to balance potential adverse events inherent to COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: We identified 3165 AIS patients who received EVT during April to July 2020, in which COVID-19 was confirmed in 104 (3.3%). Comorbid COVID-19 infection was associated with younger age, male sex, diabetes, black race, Hispanic ethnicity, intubation, acute coronary syndrome, acute renal failure, and longer hospital and intensive care unit length of stay. The rate of in-hospital death was 12.4% without COVID-19 vs 29.8% with COVID-19 (P<0.001). In mixed-effects logistic regression that accounted for patient clustering by hospital, comorbid COVID-19 increased the odds of in-hospital death over four-fold (OR 4.48, 95% CI 3.02 to 6.165). Comorbid COVID-19 was also associated with lower odds of a favorable discharge (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.61). In the sensitivity analysis, comparing AIS patients with COVID-19 who did not undergo EVT (n=2139) to the AIS EVT patients with COVID-19, there was no difference in the rate of in-hospital death (30.6% vs 29.8%, P=0.868), and AIS EVT patients had a higher rate of favorable discharge (32.4% vs 47.1%, P=0.002). CONCLUSION: In AIS patients treated with EVT, comorbid COVID-19 infection was associated with in-hospital death and a lower odds of favorable discharge compared with patients without COVID-19, but not compared with AIS patients with COVID-19 who did not undergo EVT. AIS EVT patients with COVID-19 were younger, more likely to be male, have systemic complications, and almost twice as likely to be black and over three times as likely to be Hispanic.","de Havenon, Adam; Yaghi, Shadi; Mistry, Eva A; Delic, Alen; Hohmann, Samuel; Shippey, Ernie; Stulberg, Eric; Tirschwell, David; Frontera, Jennifer A; Petersen, Nils H; Anadani, Mohammad",J Neurointerv Surg,,466

Testosterone deficiency may contribute to earlier onset of metabolic syndrome. The study aimed to assess connections between serum testosterone concentrations and metabolic disorders as well as body composition in TGCT survivors. 336 TGCT patients with over two years of complete post-treatment remission were divided into three groups: definite testosterone deficiency (< 8 nmol/L), 'grey zone' (8-12 nmol/L) and normal testosterone (> 12 nmol/L; control group) to assess differences in metabolism. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. The multivariate analysis assessed the risk of metabolic disorders and changes in body composition with regard to testosterone concentrations adjusted for age, smoking history, clinical stage, type of treatment and follow-up period. 14% of patients presented with definite testosterone deficiency; 46% were in the 'grey zone'. On multivariate analysis, low testosterone levels were related to hyperglycemia, hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, inflammatory processes, procoagulant state and obesity. The odds ratio (OR) for the onset of metabolic syndrome was 2.87 (95% CI 1.74-4.73, p < 0.001) for the 'grey zone' patients and 7.92 (95% CI 3.76-16.70, p < 0.001) for those with definite testosterone deficiency. Testosterone concentrations were independently associated with metabolic disorders in TGCT survivors. Testicular cancer survivors often have lower testosterone and metabolic disorders. Apart from recurrence, follow-up should focus on promoting a healthy lifestyle, preventing and managing late effects.","Poniatowska, Grazyna; Michalski, Wojciech; Kucharz, Jakub; Jonska-Gmyrek, Joanna; Wieszczy, Paulina; Nietupski, Karol; Demkow, Tomasz; Dedecjus, Marek; Sadowska, Malgorzata; Kalinowski, Tomasz; Grochulska-Nalazek, Beata; Nowatorska, Ada; Stelmasiak, Pawel; Wiechno, Pawel J",Med Oncol,,466

An idiosyncratic trait of coronaviruses is the presence of spike glycoproteins on the viral envelope, which mediate the virus binding to specific host receptor, enabling its entry into the human cells. In spite of the high sequence identity of SARS-CoV-2 with its closely related SARS-CoV emerged in 2002, the atomic-level determinants underlining the molecular recognition of SARS-CoV-2 to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and, thus, the rapid virus spread into human body, remain unresolved. Here, multi-microsecond-long molecular dynamics simulations enabled us to unprecedentedly dissect the key molecular traits liable of the higher affinity/specificity of SARS-CoV-2 toward ACE2 as compared to SARS-CoV. This supplies a minute per-residue contact map underlining its stunningly high infectivity. Harnessing this knowledge is pivotal for urgently developing effective medical countermeasures to face the ongoing global health crisis.","Spinello, Angelo; Saltalamacchia, Andrea; Magistrato, Alessandra",J Phys Chem Lett,,466

The aim was to examine how students experienced writing about their immediate realities under emergency remote teaching and learning conditions. Students were asked to write about what they had learnt as a result of being impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic. Then, they were invited to post these stories on an online platform. Four themes emerged from students’ reflections on writing about this experience. First, they felt that writing was purposeful and that they were writing for a larger audience. Second, because time and space for critical reflection was provided, some level of renewed dispositions towards the self and others was experienced. Third, writing became an emotionally charged process. Finally, numerous students reflected that writing about something so personal and being encouraged to share their experiences on a public online platform brought about a sense of discomfort. Hence, teachers who want to engage with critical pedagogy under “emergency” conditions may need to recontextualise their practice to suit the present needs and realities of students. © 2021 National Institute of Education, Singapore.","Joseph Jeyaraj, J.",Asia Pacific Journal of Education,,466

To date, â¼530,000 people died of this disease worldwide. Presently, researchers/clinicians are adopting the drug repurposing strategy to combat this disease. It has also been observed that some repurposed anti-viral drugs may serve as potent inhibitors of SARS CoV-2 Mpro, a key component of viral replication. Apart from these anti-viral drugs, recently dexamethasone (an important corticosteroid) is effectively used to treat COVID-19 patients. However, the mechanism behind the mode of its action is not so clear. Additionally, the effect of other well-known corticosteroids to control this disease by inhibiting the proteolytic activity of Mpro is ambiguous. In this study, we have adopted computational approaches to understand these aspects. Six well-known corticosteroids (cortisone, hydrocortisone, prednisolone, methylprednisolone, betamethasone and dexamethasone) and two repurposed drugs (darunavir and lopinavir) against COVID-19 were subjected for molecular docking studies. Two of them (betamethasone and dexamethasone) were selected by comparing their binding affinities with selected repurposed drugs toward Mpro. Betamethasone and dexamethasone interacted with both the catalytic residues of Mpro (His41 and Cys145). Molecular dynamics studies further revealed that these two Mpro-corticosteroid complexes are more stable, experience less conformational fluctuations and more compact than Mpro-darunavir/lopinavir complexes. These findings were additionally validated by MM-GBSA analysis. This study provides corroboration for execution of anti-COVID-19 activity of dexamethasone. Our study also emphasizes on the use of another important corticosteroid (betamethasone) as potential therapeutic agent for COVID-19 treatment.","Ghosh, Rajesh; Chakraborty, Ayon; Biswas, Ashis; Chowdhuri, Snehasis",J Biomol Struct Dyn,,466

We conducted a randomized controlled study to confirm the effectiveness of remote management using the mobile phone WeChat app on comprehensive management of diabetes mellitus during the COVID-19 epidemic. METHODS: We distributed questionnaires that collected information on the health condition of people with diabetes during the COVID-19 epidemic through the WeChat app. We assigned 90 cases to the intervention group and 90 cases to the control group. The intervention group was managed remotely through the WeChat app, and the control group received traditional medical treatment. The blood glucose, blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), time in range (TIR) and incidence of hypoglycemia were compared after three months of follow-up. RESULTS: The BMI and postprandial blood glucose (PBG) of the control group at 3 months was significantly higher than that at baseline (P < 0.001), and TIR decreased at 3 months (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in blood pressure compared with baseline in the control group, while blood pressure decreased in the intervention group (P < 0.05). In the intervention group, fast blood glucose(FBG) and PBG decreased compared with their baseline values, and the TIR level increased, both of which were statistically significant (P < 0.001). The FBG, PBG, and TIR of the intervention group were better than those in the control group at 3 months (P < 0.05). There was no difference in the incidence of hypoglycemia between the two groups. CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 epidemic, diabetes treatment has been facing new challenges, and the traditional treatment mode is limited. Remote management can increase TIR without increasing the risk of hypoglycemia. Remote management can prevent weight gain and improve patients' self-management and compliance during the COVID-19 epidemic.","Kang, Jing; Chen, Yan; Zhao, Ying; Zhang, Chuan",Prim. care diabetes,,466

There is an incomplete understanding of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and transmission potential at this time and the resultant anxiety has led to variable breastfeeding recommendations for suspected or confirmed mothers with novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Due to the potential concern for transmission of infection from maternal respiratory secretions to the newborn, temporary separation of the maternal-baby dyad, allowing for expressed breast milk to be fed to the infant, was initially recommended but later revised to include breastfeeding by the American Academy of Pediatrics in contrast to international societies, which recommend direct breastfeeding. This separation can have negative health and emotional implications for both mother and baby. Only two publications have reported SARS-CoV-2 in human breast milk but the role of breast milk as a vehicle of transmission of COVID-19 to the newborns still remains unclear and may indeed be providing protective antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 infection even in infected neonates. Other modes of transmission of infection to neonates from infected mothers or any care providers cannot be overemphasized. Symptomatic mothers on hydroxychloroquine can safely breastfeed and no adverse effects were reported in a baby treated with remdesivir in another drug trial. The excretion of sarilumab in human breast milk is unknown at this time. Hence, given the overall safety of breast milk and both short-term and long- term nutritional, immunological, and developmental advantages of breast milk to newborn, breast milk should not be withheld from baby. The setting of maternal care, severity of maternal infection and availability of resources can impact the decision of breastfeeding, the role of shared decision making on breastfeeding between mother and physician needs to be emphasized. We strongly recommend direct breastfeeding with appropriate hygiene precautions unless the maternal or neonatal health condition warrants separation of this dyad.

Due to the complexity of the underlying interactions, both deterministic and stochastic epidemiological models are built upon incomplete information regarding the infectious network. Hence, rigorous mathematical epidemiology models can be utilized to combat epidemic outbreaks. We introduce a new spatiotemporal approach (SBDiEM) for modeling, forecasting and nowcasting infectious dynamics, particularly in light of recent efforts to establish a global surveillance network for combating pandemics with the use of artificial intelligence. This model can be adjusted to describe past outbreaks as well as COVID-19.

In fact, research has outlined that urban areas depend on global supply chains for their day-to-day basic functions, including energy supplies, food and safe access to potable water. The disruption of global supply chains can leave many urban areas in a very vulnerable position, in which their citizens may struggle to obtain their basic supplies, as the COVID-19 crisis has recently shown. Therefore, solutions aiming to enhance local food, water and energy production systems, even in urban environments, have to be pursued.

In this context, most nations are going to adopt new preferential policies to stimulate the development of relevant sustainable energy industries, based on the electrification of the systems supplied by renewable energy sources as confirmed by the International Energy Agency (IEA). Thus, while there is ongoing research focusing on a COVID 19 vaccine, there is also a need for researchers to work cooperatively on novel strategies for world economic recovery incorporating renewable energy policy, technology and management. In this framework, the Sustainable Development of Energy, Water and Environment Systems (SDEWES) conference provides a good platform for researchers and other experts to exchange their academic thoughts, promoting the development and improvements on the renewable energy technologies as well as their role in systems and in the transition towards sustainable energy systems.

Amino acid 159 of the envelope (E) protein is reportedly implicated in the different levels of neurovirulence in mice infected with WNV NY99 or Eg101. We investigated the role of amino acid 159 of the E protein in the pathogenesis of WNV infection. We produced recombinant WNV with the structural proteins of the NY99 or Eg101 strain (NY-WT or EgCME-WT) and mutant viruses with substitutions of amino acid 159 of the E protein (NY-E-V159I or EgCME-E-I159V). The NY-WT and NY-E-V159I or EgCME-WT and EgCME-E-I159V titers in culture supernatant were similar. The mortality rate and viral titer in the brains of mice inoculated intraperitoneally with NY-WT or NY-E-V159I were also similar. In contrast, the mortality rate and viral titer in the brains of mice inoculated intracranially with EgCME-E-I159V were significantly higher than those of mice inoculated with EgCME-WT. The numbers of CD3-positive and CD8-positive T cells were greater in brains inoculated with EgCME-E-I159V than in those inoculated with EgCME-WT. Therefore, amino acid 159 of the E protein modulates the pathogenicity of WNV by affecting viral replication and T-cell infiltration in the brain.","Kobayashi, Shintaro; Kaneko, Chisato; Kawakami, Ryoko; Hasebe, Rie; Sawa, Hirofumi; Yoshii, Kentaro; Kariwa, Hiroaki",Sci Rep,,466

Healthcare workers (HCW) are a cohort vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection due to frequent and close contact with COVID-19 patients. However, they are also well trained and equipped with protective gear. The SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody status was assessed at three different time points in 450 HCW of the University Hospital Essen in Germany. HCW were stratified according to contact frequencies with COVID-19 patients in (I) a high-risk group with daily contacts with known COVID-19 patients (n = 338), (II) an intermediate-risk group with daily contacts with non-COVID-19 patients (n = 78), and (III) a low-risk group without patient contacts (n = 34). The overall seroprevalence increased from 2.2% in March-May to 4.0% in June-July to 5.1% in October-December. The SARS-CoV-2 IgG detection rate was not significantly different between the high-risk group (1.8%; 3.8%; 5.5%), the intermediate-risk group (5.1%; 6.3%; 6.1%), and the low-risk group (0%, 0%, 0%). The overall SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence remained low in HCW in western Germany one year after the outbreak of COVID-19 in Germany, and hygiene standards seemed to be effective in preventing patient-to-staff virus transmission.","Korth, Johannes; Wilde, Benjamin; Dolff, Sebastian; Frisch, Jasmin; Jahn, Michael; Krawczyk, Adalbert; Trilling, Mirko; Schipper, Leonie; Cordes, Sebastian; Ross, Birgit; Lindemann, Monika; Kribben, Andreas; Dittmer, Ulf; Witzke, Oliver; Herrmann, Anke; Anastasiou, Olympia Evdoxia",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,466

In thispaper, we propose a digital image forensic technique for JPEG images. It can detect any forgery in the image if the forged portion called a ghost image is having a compression quality different from that of the cover image. It is based on resaving the JPEG image at different JPEG qualities, and the detection of the forged portion is maximum when it is saved at the same JPEG quality as the cover image. Also, we can precisely predictthe JPEG quality of the cover image by analyzing the similarity using Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) or the energyof the images. The first maxima in SSIM or the first minima inenergy correspond to the cover image JPEG quality. We created adataset for varying JPEG compression qualities of the ghost and the cover images and validated the scalability of the experimental results.We also, experimented with varied attack scenarios, e.g. high-quality ghost image embedded in low quality of cover image,low-quality ghost image embedded in high-quality of cover image,and ghost image and cover image both at the same quality.The proposed method is able to localize the tampered portions accurately even for forgeries as small as 10x10 sized pixel blocks.Our technique is also robust against other attack scenarios like copy-move forgery, inserting text into image, rescaling (zoom-out/zoom-in) ghost image and then pasting on cover image.","Singh, Divakar",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.06439v2.pdf,466

Prognostic tool is essential in the contingency response for the next wave of outbreak. This study aims to develop prognostic models to predict COVID-19 patients' clinical outcome on day 1 and day 5 of hospital admission. METHODS: We did a retrospective analysis of a complete cohort of 1037 COVID-19 laboratory-confirmed patients in Hong Kong as of 30 April 2020, who were admitted to 16 public hospitals with their data sourced from an integrated electronic health records system. It covered demographic information, chronic disease(s) history, presenting symptoms as well as the worst clinical condition status, biomarkers' readings and Ct value of PCR tests on Day-1 and Day-5 of admission. The study subjects were randomly split into training and testing datasets in a 8:2 ratio. Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model was used to classify the training data into three disease severity groups on Day-1 and Day-5. RESULTS: The 1037 patients had a mean age of 37.8 (SD ± 17.8), 53.8% of them were male. They were grouped under three disease outcome: 4.8% critical/serious, 46.8% stable and 48.4% satisfactory. Under the full models, 30 indicators on Day-1 and Day-5 were used to predict the patients' disease outcome and achieved an accuracy rate of 92.3% and 99.5%. With a trade-off between practical application and predictive accuracy, the full models were reduced into simpler models with seven common specific predictors, including the worst clinical condition status (4-level), age group, and five biomarkers, namely, CRP, LDH, platelet, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio and albumin/globulin ratio. Day-1 model's accuracy rate, macro-/micro-averaged sensitivity and specificity were 91.3%, 84.9%/91.3% and 96.0%/95.7% respectively, as compared to 94.2%, 95.9%/94.2% and 97.8%/97.1% under Day-5 model. CONCLUSIONS: Both Day-1 and Day-5 models can accurately predict the disease severity. Relevant clinical management could be planned according to the predicted patients' outcome. The model is transformed into a simple online calculator to provide convenient clinical reference tools at the point of care, with an aim to inform clinical decision on triage and step-down care.","Tsui, Eva L H; Lui, Carrie S M; Woo, Pauline P S; Cheung, Alan T L; Lam, Peggo K W; Tang, Van T W; Yiu, C F; Wan, C H; Lee, Libby H Y",BMC Med Inform Decis Mak,,466

This was accompanied by public discourse that portrayed older adults stereotypically as vulnerable and frail but also highlighted the hardships younger people have to endure to protect them. Given the possibly detrimental effects of ageism on individuals and societies, we were interested in older adults' perception of ageism in the Corona-crisis and its relation to their health and well-being. Furthermore, we were interested in subjective aging variables as moderators in the ageism-health relationship. In June 2020, N = 611 independently living people aged 60 + from the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg were recruited via a survey research institute and interviewed online or by phone. They reported on perceived ageism in different contexts, their life satisfaction, subjective health, subjective age and self-perceptions of aging. Depending on context, ageism was perceived by around 20% of participants, and overall negatively related to subjective health and life satisfaction after the onset of the pandemic. Moderated hierarchical regressions showed that a younger subjective age buffered the negative effect of ageism on subjective health, while perceiving aging as social loss increased its effect on life satisfaction. We discuss the importance of addressing and reducing ageism (not only) in times of crisis and the consequences for individuals and societies.","Kornadt, Anna E; Albert, Isabelle; Hoffmann, Martine; Murdock, Elke; Nell, Josepha",Eur J Ageing,,466

This exploratory analysis aimed to determine how various measures of recurrence would influence the definition of treatment success. METHODS: Using an EHR dataset from 01/2007-06/2019 linked with Medtronic cardiac implantable electronic device (CIED) data, patients who underwent a first AF ablation procedure following CIED implantation were identified. Data were analyzed for recurrence of AF stratified by varying definitions of successful ablation. Performance of various simulated external AF monitoring strategies was assessed. RESULTS: A total of 665 patients were analyzed including 248 with paroxysmal AF (mean age 66.2±9.3 years, 73.0% male) and 417 patients with persistent AF (mean age 67.3±9.0 years, 73.6% male). Among patients with paroxysmal AF, survival free from recurrence at 1 year ranged from 28.2% to 72.1% (>6 min and >23 hours thresholds, respectively) with an overall median percentage of time in AF reduction of 99.6%. Among patients with persistent AF, survival free from recurrence at 1 year ranged from 24.9% to 60.0% (>6 min and 7 consecutive days >23 hours thresholds, respectively) with an overall median percentage of time in AF reduction of 99.3%. A single 7-day monitoring strategy had a sensitivity of <50% for detecting AF > 6 min in patients with paroxysmal and persistent AF. CONCLUSION: In this real-world dataset of AF patients with CIEDs undergoing catheter ablation, treatment success varied substantially with different definitions of minimally required AF duration and is significantly impacted by the method of recurrence detection.

Understanding the human-animal interface and its relevance to disease transmission remains a critical control point for many emerging zoonoses. Determination of the susceptibility of various animal species to infection with SARS-CoV-2 and the role of animals in the epidemiology of the disease will be critical to informing appropriate human and veterinary public health responses to this pandemic. A scoping literature review was conducted to collect, evaluate and present the available research evidence regarding SARS-CoV-2 infections in animals. Experimental studies have successfully demonstrated SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission in cats, ferrets, hamsters, bats and non-human primates under experimental settings. Dogs appear to have limited susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2, while other domestic species including pigs and poultry do not appear susceptible. Naturally occurring SARS-CoV-2 infections in animals appear uncommon, with 14 pets, 8 captive big cats and an unreported number of farmed mink testing positive at the time of writing (early July 2020). Infections typically appear asymptomatic in dogs, while clinical signs of respiratory and/or gastrointestinal disease tend to be mild to moderate in felines, and severe to fatal in mink. Most animals are presumed to have been infected by close contact with COVID-19 patients. In domestic settings, viral transmission is self-limiting; however in high-density animal environments, there can be sustained between-animal transmission. To date, two potential cases of animal-to-human transmission are being investigated, on infected mink farms. Given the millions of COVID-19 cases worldwide and ongoing potential for further zoonotic and anthroponotic viral transmission, further research and surveillance activities are needed to definitively determine the role of animals in community transmission of SARS-CoV-2.","Hobbs, Emma C; Reid, Tristan J",Transbound. emerg. dis.

In addition, the number of E. coli biofilm infections continue to increase with time. Notably, biofilms are attractive targets for the prevention of infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria. Moreover, the pgaABCD-encoded Poly-ß-1,6-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (PNAG) plays an important role in biofilm formation. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the specific effect of the (R)-(+)-pulegone (PU) on growth and biofilm formation in multi-drug resistant E. coli. The molecular mechanisms involved were also examined. The results showed that PU had significant antibacterial and antibiofilm formation activity against E. coli K1, with MIC and MBC values of 23.68 and 47.35 mg/mL, respectively. On the other hand, the maximum inhibition rate for biofilm formation in the bacterium was 52.36 % at 94.70 mg/mL of PU. qRT-PCR data showed that PU significantly down-regulated expression of the pgaABCD genes (P < 0.05). PU was also broadly effective against biofilm formation in MG1655 and MG1655/&#916;pgaABCD, exhibiting the maximum inhibition rates were 98.23 % and 93.35 %, respectively. In addition, PU destroyed pre-formed mature biofilm in both MG1655 and MG1655/&#916;pgaABCD about 95.03 % and 92.4 %, respectively. The study therefore verified that pgaA was a potential and key target for PU in E. coli although it was not the only one. Overall, the findings indicated that PU is a potential and novel inhibitor of drug resistance, This therefore gives insights on new ways of preventing and treating biofilm-associated infections in the food industry as well as in clinical practice.","Gong, Haiyan; He, Lijuan; Zhao, Zhilong; Mao, Xinmin; Zhang, Chen",Biomed Pharmacother,,466

We aimed to establish what is known about how loneliness and disease containment measures impact on the mental health in children and adolescents. METHOD: For this rapid review, we searched MEDLINE, PsycInfo, and Web of Science for articles published between January 1, 1946, and March 29, 2020. Of the articles, 20% were double screened using predefined criteria, and 20% of data was double extracted for quality assurance. RESULTS: A total of 83 articles (80 studies) met inclusion criteria. Of these, 63 studies reported on the impact of social isolation and loneliness on the mental health of previously healthy children and adolescents (n = 51,576; mean age 15.3 years). In all, 61 studies were observational, 18 were longitudinal, and 43 were cross-sectional studies assessing self-reported loneliness in healthy children and adolescents. One of these studies was a retrospective investigation after a pandemic. Two studies evaluated interventions. Studies had a high risk of bias, although longitudinal studies were of better methodological quality. Social isolation and loneliness increased the risk of depression, and possibly anxiety at the time at which loneliness was measured and between 0.25 and 9 years later. Duration of loneliness was more strongly correlated with mental health symptoms than intensity of loneliness. CONCLUSION: Children and adolescents are probably more likely to experience high rates of depression and most likely anxiety during and after enforced isolation ends. This may increase as enforced isolation continues. Clinical services should offer preventive support and early intervention where possible and be prepared for an increase in mental health problems.","Loades, Maria Elizabeth; Chatburn, Eleanor; Higson-Sweeney, Nina; Reynolds, Shirley; Shafran, Roz; Brigden, Amberly; Linney, Catherine; McManus, Megan Niamh; Borwick, Catherine; Crawley, Esther",J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry,,466

PURPOSE: A case of invasive fungal infections (IFIs) with subtherapeutic posaconazole prophylaxis in a gastric bypass patient following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is reported. SUMMARY: A 52-year-old malnourished male with a medical history of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass for obesity developed acute myelogenous leukemia and underwent allogeneic HSCT approximately 17 months later. He was admitted 1 month after HSCT for failure to thrive and initiated on parenteral nutrition due to worsening diarrhea and suspected gastrointestinal graft-versus-host disease (GI GVHD). During admission, the patient was continued on daily oral posaconazole for antifungal prophylaxis and was found to have subtherapeutic posaconazole and deficient vitamin levels, likely secondary to his gastrojejunostomy and increased gastric transit time. The oral posaconazole was altered to twice-daily dosing in an effort to increase serum drug levels and prevent IFIs. CONCLUSION: Patients with a history of gastric bypass are at increased risk for malabsorption of oral posaconazole and nutrients, especially following HSCT with suspected GI GVHD.","Highsmith, Emily A; Doan, Vi P; Canada, Todd W",Am. j. health system pharm,,466

446946,Granular parakeratosis secondary to benzalkonium chloride exposure from common household laundry rinse aids,2021,"Social distancing is widely acknowledged as an effective public health policy combating the novel coronavirus. But extreme social distancing has costs and it is not clear how much social distancing is needed to achieve public health effects. In this article, we develop a design-based framework to make inference about the dose-response relationship between social distancing and COVID-19 related death toll and case numbers. We first discuss how to embed observational data with a time-independent, continuous treatment dose into an approximate randomized experiment, and develop a randomization-based procedure that tests if a structured dose-response relationship fits the data. We then generalize the design and testing procedure to accommodate a time-dependent, treatment dose trajectory, and generalize a dose-response relationship to a longitudinal setting. Finally, we apply the proposed design and testing procedures to investigate the effect of social distancing during the phased reopening in the United States on public health outcomes using data compiled from sources including Unacast, the United States Census Bureau, and the County Health Rankings and Roadmaps Program. We rejected a primary analysis null hypothesis that stated the social distancing from April 27, 2020, to June 28, 2020, had no effect on the COVID-19-related death toll from June 29, 2020, to August 2, 2020 (p-value<0.001), and found that it took more reduction in mobility to prevent exponential growth in case numbers for non-rural counties compared to rural counties.","Zhang, Bo; Heng, Siyu; Ye, Ting; Small, Dylan S.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.06917v3.pdf,466

It allows randomness to the infectivity of individuals rather than a constant reproduction number as assumed by standard models. Key epidemiological quantities, such as the distribution of final epidemic size and expected epidemic duration, are derived and estimated based on real data for various regions and countries. The associated time lag of the effect of intervention in each country or region is estimated. Our results are consistent with the incubation time of COVID-19 found by recent medical study. We demonstrate that our model could potentially be a valuable tool in the modeling of COVID-19. More importantly, the proposed model of 2P-DCP could also be used as an important tool in epidemiological modelling as this type of contagion models with very simple structures is adequate to describe the evolution of regional epidemic and worldwide pandemic.","Chen, Zezhun; Dassios, Angelos; Kuan, Valerie; Lim, Jia Wei; Qu, Yan; Surya, Budhi; Economics, Hongbiao Zhao London School of; London, University College; London, Brunel University; Warwick, University of; Wellington, Victoria University of; Finance, Shanghai University of; Economics,",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.08355v1.pdf,466

454526,Using video-conferencing for observations and interviews: Gathering data from ‘home’ while studying in New Zealand,2020,"Computing Education Research (CER) is critical for supporting the increasing number of students who need to learn computing skills. To systematically advance knowledge, publications must be clear enough to support replications, meta-analyses, and theory-building. The goal of this study is to characterize the reporting of empiricism in CER literature by identifying whether publications include information to support replications, meta-analyses, and theory building. The research questions are: RQ1) What percentage of papers in CER venues have empirical evaluation? RQ2) What are the characteristics of the empirical evaluation? RQ3) Do the papers with empirical evaluation follow reporting norms (both for inclusion and for labeling of key information)? We conducted an SLR of 427 papers published during 2014 and 2015 in five CER venues: SIGCSE TS, ICER, ITiCSE, TOCE, and CSE. We developed and applied the CER Empiricism Assessment Rubric. Over 80% of papers had some form of empirical evaluation. Quantitative evaluation methods were the most frequent. Papers most frequently reported results on interventions around pedagogical techniques, curriculum, community, or tools. There was a split in papers that had some type of comparison between an intervention and some other data set or baseline. Many papers lacked properly reported research objectives, goals, research questions, or hypotheses, description of participants, study design, data collection, and threats to validity. CER authors are contributing empirical results to the literature; however, not all norms for reporting are met. We encourage authors to provide clear, labeled details about their work so readers can use the methodologies and results for replications and meta-analyses. As our community grows, our reporting of CER should mature to help establish computing education theory to support the next generation of computing learners.","Heckman, Sarah; Carver, Jeffrey C.; Sherriff, Mark; Al-Zubidy, Ahmed",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.01984v1.pdf,466

Implications pour l'interpretation des etudes observationnelles sur le role des bloqueurs du SRAA durant l'infection a SARS-CoV-2",2020,"Background: The world is facing the Coronavirus pandemic, which is highly infectious. Several measures have been put in place to prevent its spread among the population. However, for these preventive measures to be effective, the population requires appropriate and sufficient knowledge, attitude, and practices. Thus, a survey to assess knowledge, attitude, and self-reported practice toward measures for prevention of the spread of COVID-19 was conducted among Ugandans. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study conducted among during the lockdown in Uganda. An online structured questionnaire was used, applying a snowballing sampling approach for recruitment of participants 18 years and above and residing in Uganda. Data collection was done from 6th to 15th April 2020, during which 1,763 people participated. We analyzed all data using STATA 14.2, applying appropriate statistical tests. Results: Out of 1,763 participants, 80% were highly knowledgeable. For attitude, 72.4% reported following recommendations given by the Ministry of health to prevent the spread of COVID-19; 89.0% were worried about contracting COVID-19 and 73.3% agreed that COVID-19 can be cured and 99.3% reported good practice toward measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19. According to ordered logistic regression, health workers were 6 times more knowledgeable [aOR:6 (3.51-10.09), p < 0.001] followed by teachers [aOR:5.2 (2.6-10.32), p < 0.001]; students [aOR:3.2 (1.96-5.33), p < 0.001]. On the contrary, the drivers, business entrepreneurs, and security personnel had less knowledge. Conclusion: The results show that the participating Ugandans were knowledgeable and had a positive attitude and good practices. However, there is still a gap in knowledge among drivers, business entrepreneurs, and security personnel. Therefore, there is a need to mobilize the country's population to have the same degree of knowledge, which will have an impact on the attitude and practices toward prevention of the spread of COVID-19.","Ssebuufu, Robinson; Sikakulya, Franck Katembo; Mambo, Simon Binezero; Wasingya, Lucien; Nganza, Sifa K; Ibrahim, Bwaga; Kyamanywa, Patrick",Front Public Health,,466

While clear classifications and validated measures of burnout exist, documentation burden remains ill-defined and inconsistently measured. We aim to conduct a scoping review focused on identifying approaches to documentation burden measurement and their characteristics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) Extension for Scoping Reviews (ScR) guidelines, we conducted a scoping review assessing MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and CINAHL from inception to April 2020 for studies investigating documentation burden among physicians and nurses in ambulatory or inpatient settings. Two reviewers evaluated each potentially relevant study for inclusion/exclusion criteria. RESULTS: Of the 3482 articles retrieved, 35 studies met inclusion criteria. We identified 15 measurement characteristics, including 7 effort constructs: EHR usage and workload, clinical documentation/review, EHR work after hours and remotely, administrative tasks, cognitively cumbersome work, fragmentation of workflow, and patient interaction. We uncovered 4 time constructs: average time, proportion of time, timeliness of completion, activity rate, and 11 units of analysis. Only 45.0% of studies assessed the impact of EHRs on clinicians and/or patients and 40.0% mentioned clinician burnout. DISCUSSION: Standard and validated measures of documentation burden are lacking. While time and effort were the core concepts measured, there appears to be no consensus on the best approach nor degree of rigor to study documentation burden. CONCLUSION: Further research is needed to reliably operationalize the concept of documentation burden, explore best practices for measurement, and standardize its use.","Moy, Amanda J; Schwartz, Jessica M; Chen, RuiJun; Sadri, Shirin; Lucas, Eugene; Cato, Kenrick D; Rossetti, Sarah Collins",J. am. med. inform. assoc,,466

And all this is happening against a background in which Artificial Intelligence (AI) plays an increasingly important role and it would be very difficult for us to imagine our lives without it, especially since robots save lives today. Technology has become a necessity, many jobs have changed due to robotics, and we must evolve and adapt with it, even though the new rules that came with the onset of restrictions and mutations in the labour market due to the new coronavirus pandemic that spread worldwide.

469412,Impact of global pandemic COVID-19 on Air Transport in Slovakia in the Period from March to June 2020,2020,"BACKGROUND: Vietnam applied strict quarantine measures to mitigate the rapid transmission of the SARS-COV-2 virus. Central questions were how the COVID-19 pandemic affected health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of the Vietnamese general population, and whether there is any difference in HRQOL among people under different quarantine conditions. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted during 1 April- 30 May 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic was at its peak in Vietnam. Data was collected via an online survey using Google survey tool. A convenient sampling approach was employed, with participants being sorted into three groups: people who were in government quarantine facilities; people who were under self-isolation at their own place; and the general population who did not need enforced quarantine. The Vietnamese EQ-5D-5L instrument was used to measure HRQOL. Differences in HRQOL among people of isolation groups and their socio-demographic characteristics were statistically tested. RESULTS: A final sample was made of 406 people, including 10 persons from government quarantine facilities, 57 persons under self-isolation at private places, and the rest were the general population. The mean EQ-VAS was reported the highest at 90.5 (SD: 7.98) among people in government quarantine facilities, followed by 88.54 (SD: 12.24) among general population and 86.54 (SD 13.69) among people in self-isolation group. The EQ-5D-5L value was reported the highest among general population at 0.95 (SD: 0.07), followed by 0.94 (SD: 0.12) among people in government quarantine facilities, and 0.93 (SD: 0.13) among people who did self-isolation. Overall, most people, at any level, reported having problems with anxiety and/or depression in all groups. CONCLUSION: While there have been some worries and debates on implementing strict quarantine measures can hinder people's quality of life, Vietnam showed an opposite tendency in people's HRQOL even under the highest level of enforcement in the prevention and control of COVID-19.","Vu, Mai Quynh; Tran, Thao Thi Phuong; Hoang, Thao Anh; Khuong, Long Quynh; Hoang, Minh Van",PLoS One,,466
470296,Influenza risk perception and travel-related health protection behavior in the US: Insights for the aftermath of the COVID-19 outbreak,2020,"BACKGROUND: The outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has dramatically changed societies in 2020. Since the end of February, Europe has been hit particularly hard by COVID-19, but there are major country differences in both the spread of the virus and measures taken to stop the virus. Social psychological factors such as institutional trust could be important in understanding the development of the epidemic. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine country variations of COVID-19 mortality in Europe by analyzing social risk factors explaining the spread of the disease, restrictions and control measures, and institutional trust. METHODS: The present study was based on a background analysis of European Social Survey data on 25 European countries (N=47,802). Multilevel mixed effects linear regression models focused on 84 days of the COVID-19 epidemic (January 22 to April 14, 2020) and modelled the daily COVID-19 mortality. Analysis focused on the impact of social relations, restrictions, and institutional trust within each country. RESULTS: The spread of the COVID-19 epidemic has been fast everywhere, but the findings revealed significant differences between countries in COVID-19 mortality. Perceived sociability predicted higher COVID-19 mortality. Major differences between the 25 countries were found in reaction times to the crisis. Late reaction to the crisis predicted later mortality figures. Institutional trust was associated with lower COVID-19 mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The analyses demonstrated the importance of societal and social psychological factors in the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic. By considering multiple perspectives, this study showed that country differences in Europe are major, and this will have an impact on how countries will cope with the ongoing crisis in the following months. The results indicated the importance of timely restrictions and cooperation with people.","Oksanen, Atte; Kaakinen, Markus; Latikka, Rita; Savolainen, Iina; Savela, Nina; Koivula, Aki",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,466

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to describe the pandemic's impact on pediatric palliative care clinicians' personal and professional wellbeing. METHODS: The Palliative Assessment of Needed DEvelopments &Modifications In the Era of Coronavirus (PANDEMIC) cross-sectional online survey was posted on 7 professional listservs between May and June, 2020. We conducted a conventional content analysis of written responses to three open-ended questions regarding the lasting impact of COVID-19. RESULTS: Of 207 multidisciplinary respondents from 80 U.S. cities, 148 (71%) provided written responses to open-ended questions and 62 responses (42%) were related to personal, professional, or existential well-being. These responses were sorted into 4 major categories: personal burdens, professional burdens, personal benefits, and professional benefits. Respondents described burdens more commonly than they did benefits (67% versus 33% of comments, respectively). Personal burdens related to increased fear and uncertainty, fear of bringing the virus home, and a sense of collective grief. Professional burdens included a sense of exhaustion, a challenge with work-life balance, personal experiences with colleagues infected with the virus, and considerations of leaving healthcare altogether. Personal benefits included lessons-learned, an evolving sense of what matters, and improved work-life balance. Professional benefits included opportunities for professional development and a sense of professional purpose. CONCLUSION: Pediatric palliative care clinicians perceive a breadth of impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic. Ongoing clinician assessment is important as the pandemic continues.","Rosenberg, Abby R; Weaver, Meaghann S; Fry, Abigail; Wiener, Lori",J. pain symptom manage,,466

479589,Pandemic products and volatile chemical emissions,2020,"Background: On 12 June 2020, Brazil reached the second position worldwide in the number of COVID-19 cases. Authorities increased the number of tests performed, including the identification of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 (IgG, IgA, and IgM). There was an overflooding of the market with several tests, and the presence of possible false-positive results became a challenge. The purpose of this study was to describe the seroprevalence and immunoglobulin blood levels in a group of asymptomatic individuals using the reference levels provided by the manufacturer. Methods: Levels of IgG and IgA antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were determined in blood serum by the same ELISA (enzyme-linked immunoassay) test. Patients must be free of symptoms. Results: From 20 to 22 May 2020, 938 individuals were tested. There were 441 (47%) men, age 53 years (interquartile range (IQR) = 39-63.2). The sample included 335 (35.7%) subjects aged &#8805;60 years old. Subjects with a positive test were 54 (5.8%) for IgG and 96 (10.2%) for IgA and 42 (4.5%) for both IgG and IgA. The prevalence of IgG and IgA positive test was not different in men and women and not different in individuals under 60 and over 60 years of age. Conversely, analysing only individuals with positive tests, the levels of IgG in positive subjects were significantly higher than those with an IgA positive test, 3.00 (IQR = 1.68-5.65), and 1.95 (IQR = 1.40-3.38), respectively; P = 0.017. Additionally, individuals with isolated IgA positive tests had significantly lower levels of IgA than those with both IgA and IgG positive tests: 1.95 (IQR = 1.60-2.40) and 3.15 (IQR = 2.20-3.90), respectively, P = 0.005. These latter data suggest that IgA shows a deviation of the distribution to the left in comparison to IgG distribution data. Indeed, many subjects reported as IgA positive had immunoglobulin levels slightly elevated. Conclusions: In conclusion, we strongly suggest caution in the interpretation of IgA test results. This recommendation is more important for those with positive IgA just above the reference level.","Caramelli, Bruno; Escalante-Rojas, Maria C; Chauhan, Hiteshi K C; Siciliano, Rinaldo F; Bittencourt, Marcio S; Micelli, Antonio C",J Glob Health,,466

487632,Potential impacts of COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"La survenue de formes sévères ou critiques de COVID-19, avec nécessité d'une hospitalisation en réanimation, est associée à la présence d'anticorps anti-Interféron de classe I dans environ 10 % des cas [1]. Ces anticorps identifiés dans le contexte de la COVID-19 bloquent les molécules d'interféron (IFN) et expliqueraient chez ces patients, la survenue d'une atteinte grave de COVID-19, avec une absence d'élimination précoce du virus SARS-CoV-2. Ainsi, il s'agirait d'une forme de déficit immunitaire, acquis, dirigé contre le virus SARS-CoV-2 mais aussi potentiellement contre d'autres virus. Les caractéristiques cliniques, biologiques et morphologiques des patients présentant ces anticorps n'ont pas été décrites précisément, l'évolution des patients n'est pas connue. Une recherche d'anticorps anti-Interféron a été réalisée chez des patients ayant été pris en charge en réanimation à l'hôpital Bégin, à l'hôpital Avicenne et à l'hôpital Foch pour une COVID-19. La présence d'anticorps anti-IFNalpha2 et anti-IFNomega étaient recherchée par test ELISA puis confirmée par un test fonctionnel d'inhibition de la phosphorylation de STAT1. Les caractéristiques cliniques des patients ont été relevées à partir des dossiers médicaux. Un suivi médical a été organisé afin de suivre leur évolution sur le plan clinique, biologique et morphologique. Onze patients ont été identifiés. Il s'agissait de 11 hommes. L'âge médian au diagnostic était de 60 ans (min 36 - max 80). Parmi les autres facteurs de risques de COVID-19 grave classiquement identifiés, on retrouvait chez eux, du diabète pour 1 patient, de l'hypertension artérielle pour 6 patients et de l'obésité (IMC &gt; 30 kg/m2) pour 5 patients. L'IMC médian était de 29,8 kg/m2 (min 24 - max 32,8). Il n'était pas noté d'antécédent remarquable, notamment pas d'argument pour un déficit immunitaire, pas d'endocrinopathie auto-immune. On retrouvait 1 BPCO, 2 asthmes, 1 coronaropathie et 1 valve aortique mécanique. Au diagnostic de COVID-19, les signes cliniques initiaux habituels de l'infection étaient retrouvés : asthénie (n = 11), fièvre (n= 10), toux (n = 5). Deux patients présentaient des diarrhées et 2 de l'insuffisance rénale aiguë, modérée. Chez 2 patients, on notait une embolie pulmonaire sur le scanner initial. L'évolution était marquée par une aggravation justifiant une admission en réanimation après une médiane de 7 jours (min 3 - max 12), pour une forme sévère chez 2 patients avec au maximum une oxygénothérapie au masque à haute concentration jusqu'à 15L/min pour 1 patient et 4L/min pour 1 autre. Une forme critique survenait chez 9 patients, avec recours à une intubation oro-trachéale pour ventilation mécanique pour 7 cas, une oxygénothérapie nasale à haut débit (OPTIFLOW) était suffisante dans 2 cas. Des pneumopathies bactériennes documentées nécessitaient une antibiothérapie spécifique dans 6 cas. Dans 10 cas, des traitements à visée spécifique du COVID-19 étaient entrepris : corticothérapie (n = 4), hydroxychloroquine (n = 4), lopinavir/ritonavir (n = 3) et tocilizumab (n = 2). En raison du développement d'un SDRA sévère, des séances d'optimisation de l'oxygénothérapie par décubitus ventral étaient entreprises chez 5 patients, avec nécessité d'un recours à une ECMO véno-veineuse pour le jeune patient de 36 ans. Afin d'éliminer les Ac antiIFN, ce dernier a également bénéficié avec succès de 3 séances d'échanges plasmatiques. Au total, 9 patients ont survécu, la durée médiane d'hospitalisaiton en réanimation était de 16 jours (min 2 - max 31). Les 2 décès sont intervenus après limitation thérapeutique pour SDRA réfractaire. Avec un suivi médian de 4,2 mois (min 1 - max 11,2), on note une bonne évolution chez l'ensemble des patients survivants, aucune réinfection n'a été observée et une régression quasi complète des lésions pulmonaires scanographiques (n = 4/5) était retrouvée à 3 mois. Lors du dernier bilan réalisé, il n'éta t pas constaté d'anomalie de la NFS (n = 7/8), ni syndrome inflammatoire (n = 6/7) et le taux d'immunoglobulines était normal (4/4). Cette série de cas donne une première description des patients ayant présenté une forme critique de COVID-19 avec Ac anti-IFN de classe I. En dehors de la faible prévalence de comorbidités, il ne semble pas y avoir de phénotype clinique particulier chez cette population en dehors de la prédominance masculine.

Pregnant individuals are a unique subgroup of the population with distinctive considerations regarding risk and benefit that extend beyond themselves to their fetus/newborn. As a complement to traditional pharmacovigilance and clinical studies, evidence to comprehensively assess COVID-19 vaccine safety in pregnancy will need to be generated through observational epidemiologic studies in large populations. However, there are several unique methodological challenges that face observational assessments of vaccination during pregnancy, some of which may be more pronounced for COVID-19 studies. In this contribution, we discuss the most critical study design, data collection, and analytical issues likely to arise. We offer brief guidance to optimize the quality of such studies to ensure their maximum value for informing public health decision-making.","Fell, Deshayne B; Dimitris, Michelle C; Hutcheon, Jennifer A; Ortiz, Justin R; Platt, Robert W; Regan, Annette K; Savitz, David A",Vaccine,,466

The model showed that, although no death of children would result from the reopening of the schools in the three cities analysed, the risk of asymptomatic and symptomatic cases and secondary cases among teachers, school staff and relatives of the children is not negligible. Although the epidemic hit different regions with different intensities, our model shows that, for regions where the incidence profile is similar to the cities analysed, the risk of reopening of schools is still too high. This in spite of the fact that incidences in these cities were declining in the period of the time considered. Therefore, although we cannot extend the result to the entire country, the overall conclusion is valid for regions with a declining incidence and it is even more valid for regions where incidence is increasing. We assumed a very conservative level of infection transmissibility of children of just 10% as that of adults. In spite of the very low level of transmissibility is assumed, the number of secondary cases caused by infected children among teachers, school staff and relatives varied from 2 to 85. It is, therefore, too soon to have any degree of confidence that reopening of schools before the advent of a vaccine is the right decision to take. The purpose of our model and simulations is to provide a method to estimate the risk of school reopening, although we are sure it could be applied as a guide to public health strategies.","Massad, Eduardo; Amaku, Marcos; Tadeu Covas, Dimas; Fernandes Lopez, Luis; Coutinho, Francisco Antonio Bezerra",Epidemiol Infect,,466

Considering situational emergency of identifying novel targeted therapy, we have chosen herbal compound Adathoda justice/ vasica which is high potent olden vital compound having key role in various respiratory conditions with multiple beneficial uses. Adathoda is promoted and supported by the Ministry of AYUSH for symptomatic management of respiratory ailments in case of COVID 19. In this study, we focused Adathoda primary active alkaloid vasicine efficacy against coronavirus infectious symptoms, evaluated by in Silico screening studies on virus proteins ACE 2 Receptor, 3CL protease and Spike protein SARS HR1 motif using PyRx tool and AutoDoc 1.5.6. Based on PyRx results, Vasicine with ACE 2 Receptor shown higher docking affinity score -7.1 K/cal respectively when compared to other virus proteins. AutoDoc 1.5.6 screening study report showed that vasicine promotes good inhibitory constant 486.54 mM on 3CL protease more than others. Results reveal that the vasicine could be a potential target for the treatment of COVID 19. This study adds strong evidence to the claim by the advisory released by AYUSH. Based on the results with available literature Adathoda could be a drug helpful in relieving symptoms in non COVID cases those who were quarantined or in lockdown pace thereby reducing pandemic panic and in confirmed asymptomatic or mild cases. For usage in moderate to severe cases this could be an add on therapy with existing modern medical therapy.","Thangaraju, Pugazhenthan; Sudha Ty, Sree; Pasala, Praveen Kumar; Hari Ty, Sri; Venkatesan, Sajitha; Thangaraju, Eswaran",Infectious disorders.

The emerging distribution of the multi-drug resistant P. falciparum becomes a worldwide concern, so the identification of unique targets and novel inhibitors is a prime need now. In the present study, we have employed pharmacoinformatics approaches to analyze 265 lead-like compounds from PubChem databases for virtual screening. Thereafter, 15 lead-like compounds were docked within the active side pocket of importin alpha. Comparative ligand properties and absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) profile were also assessed. Finally, a novel inhibitor was designed and assessed computationally for its efficacy. From the comparative analysis we have found that our screened compounds possess better results than the existing lead ivermectin; having the highest binding energy of -15.6â¯kcal/mol, whereas ivermectin has -12.4â¯kcal/mol. The novel lead compound possessed more fascinating output without deviating any of the rules of Lipinski. It also possessed higher bioavailability and the drug-likeness score of 0.55 and 0.71, respectively compared to ivermectin. Furthermore, the binding study was confirmed by molecular dynamics simulation over 25â¯ns by evaluating the stability of the complex. Finally, all the screened compounds and the novel compound showed promising ADMET properties likewise.

In China, interventional therapies with traditional Chinese medicine for COVID-19 have achieved significant clinical efficacies, but the underlying pharmacological mechanisms are still unclear. This article reviewed the etiology of COVID-19 and clinical efficacy. Both network pharmacological study and literature search were used to demonstrate the possible action mechanisms of Chinese medicines in treating COVID-19. We found that Chinese medicines played the role of antivirus, anti-inflammation and immunoregulation, and target organs protection in the management of COVID-19 by multiple components acting on multiple targets at multiple pathways. AEC2 and 3CL protein could be the direct targets for inhibiting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Quercetin, kaempferol, luteolin, isorhamnetin, baicalein, naringenin, and wogonin could be the main active ingredients of Chinese medicines for the management of COVID-19 by targeting on AEC2 and 3CL protein and inhibiting inflammatory mediators, regulating immunity, and eliminating free radicals through COX-2, CASP3, IL-6, MAPK1, MAPK14, MAPK8, and REAL in the signaling pathways of IL-17, arachidonic acid, HIF-1, NF-&#954;B, Ras, and TNF.

The occurrence in an ICU context in hypoxic patients, with metabolic disorders, taking several types of medication, makes difficult to establish a precise cause. Also, the implication of SARS-CoV-2 by direct invasion of the CNS or by immune-mediated phenomena is not yet clear. Currently, a dozen of cases of myoclonus as a predominant clinical manifestation, immune-mediated by SARS-Cov-2 are published. In all these cases, myoclonus was preceded by respiratory or other suggestive symptoms (e.g., anosmia) for this infection making straightforward the causal link. We describe a case of an isolated generalized myoclonus without other clinical complaints nor chest CT scan abnormalities nor SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection on nasopharyngeal swabs and on the CSF, as a para-infectious phenomenon of COVID-19 infection with excellent response to steroids perfusion. This challenging diagnosis was made upon confirmation of seroconversion (serology was negative at admission, then positive for IgM at day 6, then for both IgM and IgG at day 10) underlying that repeating serology is a diagnostic key to capture a similar findings.","El Otmani, Hicham; Moutaouakil, Fettouma; Ouazzani, Mehdi; Mjahed, Khalid",Neurol. sci,,466

We assessed advance directive completion, healthcare proxy (HCP), and attitudes toward ACP among older adults ages 50+ living with HIV during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Internet-based surveys were administered to 100 participants residing in the Coachella Valley, California from April to June 2020. We examined self-reported completion of an advance directive, HCP, and attitudes toward ACP before and after COVID-19. Adjusted regressions were performed on attitudes toward ACP. Results: Participants' mean age was 64.2 years, most were non-Hispanic white (88.0%), men (96.0%), and identified as sexual minorities (96.0%). Many reported having an advance directive (59.6%) or HCP (67.3%). Most (57.6%) believed ACP to be more important now compared to the pre-pandemic era. Having an advance directive was associated with increase in age, higher education, living with other people, never having an AIDS diagnosis, and current undetectable viral load (p < 0.05). Having a HCP was associated with higher education, being married/partnered, and living with other people (p < 0.05). In a logistic regression model adjusted for education and living situation, the belief that ACP was more important during COVID was associated with not having an advance directive (OR: 5.07, 95% CI: 1.78-14.40) and fear of COVID-19 infection (OR: 4.17, 95% CI: 1.61-10.76.) Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic presents a window of opportunity to engage people aging with HIV in ACP discussions, particularly those who do not already have an advance directive.","Nguyen, Annie L; Davtyan, Mariam; Taylor, Jeff; Christensen, Christopher; Brown, Brandon",Front Public Health,,466

We conducted a prospective observational study to assess the rate of NIOS failure in subjects treated in the ICU for hypoxemic respiratory failure due to COVID-19. METHODS: Patients receiving first-line treatment NIOS for hypoxemic respiratory failure due to COVID-19 in the ICU of a university hospital were included in this study; laboratory data were collected upon arrival, and 28-d outcome was recorded. After propensity score matching based on Simplified Acute Physiology (SAPS) II score, age, [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] at arrival, the NIOS failure rate in subjects with COVID-19 was compared to a previously published cohort who received NIOS during hypoxemic respiratory failure due to other causes. RESULTS: A total of 85 subjects received first-line treatment with NIOS. The most frequently used methods were helmet noninvasive ventilation and high-flow nasal cannula; of these, 52 subjects (61%) required endotracheal intubation. Independent factors associated with NIOS failure were SAPS II score (P = .009) and serum lactate dehydrogenase at enrollment (P = .02); the combination of SAPS II score &#8805; 33 with serum lactate dehydrogenase &#8805; 405 units/L at ICU admission had 91% specificity in predicting the need for endotracheal intubation. In the propensity-matched cohorts (54 pairs), subjects with COVID-19 showed higher risk of NIOS failure than those with other causes of hypoxemic respiratory failure (59% vs 35%, P = .02), with an adjusted hazard ratio of 2 (95% CI 1.1-3.6, P = .01). CONCLUSIONS: As compared to hypoxemic respiratory failure due to other etiologies, subjects with COVID-19 who were treated with NIOS in the ICU were burdened by a 2-fold higher risk of failure. Subjects with a SAPS II score &#8805; 33 and serum lactate dehydrogenase &#8805; 405 units/L represent the population with the greatest risk.","Menga, Luca Salvatore; Cese, Luca Delle; Bongiovanni, Filippo; Lombardi, Gianmarco; Michi, Teresa; Luciani, Filippo; Cicetti, Marta; Timpano, Jacopo; Ferrante, Maria Cristina; Cesarano, Melania; Anzellotti, Gian Marco; Rosà, Tommaso; Natalini, Daniele; Tanzarella, Eloisa S; Cutuli, Salvatore Lucio; Pintaudi, Gabriele; De Pascale, Gennaro; Dell039,; Anna, Antonio M; Bello, Giuseppe; Pennisi, Mariano Alberto; Maggiore, Salvatore Maurizio; Maviglia, Riccardo; Grieco, Domenico Luca; Antonelli, Massimo",Respir Care,,466

While blockade of such PPIs with small molecules is more challenging than that with antibodies, small-molecule inhibitors (SMIs) might offer alternatives that are less strain- and mutation-sensitive, suitable for oral or inhaled administration, and more controllable/less immunogenic. Here, we report the identification of SMIs of this PPI by screening our compound library focused around the chemical space of organic dyes. Among promising candidates identified, several dyes (Congo red, direct violet 1, Evans blue) and novel druglike compounds (DRI-C23041, DRI-C91005) inhibited the interaction of hACE2 with the spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV with low micromolar activity in our cell-free ELISA-type assays (IC50's of 0.2-3.0 µM), whereas control compounds, such as sunset yellow FCF, chloroquine, and suramin, showed no activity. Protein thermal shift assays indicated that the SMIs of interest identified here bind SARS-CoV-2-S and not hACE2. While dyes seemed to be promiscuous inhibitors, DRI-C23041 showed some selectivity and inhibited the entry of two different SARS-CoV-2-S expressing pseudoviruses into hACE2-expressing cells in a concentration-dependent manner with low micromolar IC50's (6-7 µM). This provides proof-of-principle evidence for the feasibility of small-molecule inhibition of PPIs critical for SARS-CoV-2 attachment/entry and serves as a first guide in the search for SMI-based alternative antiviral therapies for the prevention and treatment of diseases caused by coronaviruses in general and COVID-19 in particular.","Bojadzic, Damir; Alcazar, Oscar; Chen, Jinshui; Chuang, Sung-Ting; Condor Capcha, Jose M; Shehadeh, Lina A; Buchwald, Peter",ACS Infect Dis,,466

As of May 23, 2020, according to WHO, there are 213 countries, areas or territories with COVID-19 positive cases. To effectively address this situation, it is imperative to have a clear understanding of the COVID-19 transmission dynamics and to concoct efficient control measures to mitigate/contain the spread. In this work, the COVID-19 dynamics is modelled using susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed model with a nonlinear incidence rate. In order to control the transmission, the coefficient of nonlinear incidence function is adopted as the Governmental control input. To adequately understand the COVID-19 dynamics, bifurcation analysis is performed and the effect of varying reproduction number on the COVID-19 transmission is studied. The inadequacy of an open-loop approach in controlling the disease spread is validated via numerical simulations and a robust closed-loop control methodology using sliding mode control is also presented. The proposed SMC strategy could bring the basic reproduction number closer to 1 from an initial value of 2.5, thus limiting the exposed and infected individuals to a controllable threshold value. The model and the proposed control strategy are then compared with real-time data in order to verify its efficacy.","Rohith, G; Devika, K B",Nonlinear Dyn,,466

In Cuba, the first case of COVID-19 was reported on March 11. Elderly with multiple comorbidities have been the most risky population. Although most patients present a mild to moderate disease, some have developed severe symptoms. One of the possible mechanisms underlying rapid disease progression is a cytokine storm, in which interleukin (IL) -6 seems to be a major mediator. Itolizumab is a humanized recombinant anti-CD6 monoclonal antibody (MAb), with the ability of reducing serum interferon gamma (INF-γ), tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) and IL-6. Based on these previous results in patients with psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis, an expanded access clinical trial was approved by the Cuban regulatory agency for COVID-19 critically, severely and moderately ill patients. RESULTS: We show here a short kinetic of IL-6 serum concentration in the first 24 COVID-19 patients treated with itolizumab. Most of patients were elderly with multiple comorbidities. We found that with one itolizumab dose, the circulating IL-6 decreased in critically and severely ill patients, whereas in moderately ill patients the values didn’t rise as compared to their low baseline levels. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that itolizumab could be an attractive therapeutic option to decrease the negative outcome of the cytokine storm in COVID-19 patients.

This study describes reported barriers and coping mechanisms to accessing healthcare among chronic care patients during the nationwide COVID-19 lockdown in Rwanda. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted among chronic care patients enrolled in pediatric development, HIV/AIDS, non-communicable diseases, mental health, and oncology programs at 3 rural Rwandan districts. Active patients with an appointment scheduled between March–June 2020 and a phone number recorded in the electronic medical record system were eligible. Data were collected by telephone interviews between 23rd April and 11th May 2020, with proxy reporting by caregivers for children and critically ill-patients. Fisher’s exact tests were used to measure associations. Logistic regression analysis was also used to assess factors associated with reporting at least one barrier to accessing healthcare during the lockdown. RESULTS: Of 220 patient respondents, 44% reported at least one barrier to accessing healthcare. Barriers included lack of access to emergency care (n = 50; 22.7%), lack of access to medication (n = 44; 20.0%) and skipping clinical appointments (n = 37; 16.8%). Experiencing barriers was associated with the clinical program (p < 0.001), with oncology patients being highly affected (64.5%), and with increasing distance from home to the health facility (p = 0.031). In the adjusted logistic regression model, reporting at least one barrier to accessing healthcare was associated with the patient's clinical program and district of residence. Forty (18.2%) patients identified positive coping mechanisms to ensure continuation of care, such as walking long distances during suspension of public transport (n = 21; 9.6%), contacting clinicians via telephone for guidance or rescheduling appointments (n = 15; 6.8%), and delegating someone else for medication pick-up (n = 6; 2.7%). Of 124 patients who reported no barriers to accessing healthcare, 9% used positive coping mechanisms. CONCLUSION: A large proportion of chronic care patients experienced barriers to accessing healthcare during the COVID-19 lockdown. However, many patients also independently identified positive coping mechanisms to ensure continuation of care - strategies that could be formally adopted by healthcare systems in Rwanda and similar settings to mitigate effects of future lockdowns on patients.","Nshimyiryo, Alphonse; Barnhart, Dale A.; Cubaka, Vincent K.; Dusengimana, Jean Marie Vianney; Dusabeyezu, Symaque; Ndagijimana, Deogratias; Umutesi, Grace; Shyirambere, Cyprien; Karema, Nadine; Mubiligi, Joel M.; Kateera, Fredrick",BMC Public Health,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-10783-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33838676/,466

Here, we recount patient stories illustrative of this isolation, generated by insufficient professional interpreter use, ad hoc interpretation, and scarcity of media in preferred languages. When confronted with the social isolation faced by all patients during COVID-19, we more clearly saw the healthcare disparities affecting patients with LEP. A trainee-led videoconferencing initiative facilitating social calls between patients at UCSF and their loved ones proved especially helpful in reducing the disconnection that patients with LEP experience in the hospital. Motivated by the findings of this project, we advocate for other institutions to take similar action, such as hiring inpatient telehealth navigators and providing tablets for ad lib use.

One hundred fifty-nine patients and 67 healthy volunteers were included. Different assays demonstrate 41–45% of diagnostic sensitivities and 91–98% of specificities, with substantial agreement (89.3–91.2%), but a high percentage of weak positive results (13–22%) was observed with ICTs. ICTs performances were comparable to those of automated immunoassays. ICTs could have a role as screening approach due to their easy usability.

However, the original source, as well as the treatment and prevention of causative agent of COVID-19 (namely SARS-CoV-2) are still unclear nearly a year after its publicly report. The microbiome approach, which has emerged in recent years focusing on human-related microbes, has become one of the promising avenues for source tracking, treatment, and prevention of a variety of infectious diseases including COVID-19. In this review, we summarized the microbiome approach as a supplementary approach for source tracking, treatment, and prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We first provided background information on SARS-CoV-2 and microbiome approaches. Then we illustrated current strategies of microbiome methods to assist three aspects of COVID-19 research, namely source tracking, treatment, and prevention, respectively. Finally, we summarized the microbiome approaches and provided perspectives for future studies on faster and more effective SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology and pathogenesis based on microbiome approaches.","Han, Maozhen; Zha, Yuguo; Chong, Hui; Zhong, Chaofang; Ning, Kang",Comput Struct Biotechnol J,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2001037020304943; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33304459/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2001037020304943; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.csbj.2020.11.027,466
626662,Features of anosmia in COVID-19,2020-04-17,"INTRODUCTION: Little is known about the neutralizing (nAb) and binding antibody kinetics in COVID‐19 convalescent plasma donors, especially during the first 100 days after disease onset. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cohort of previously RT‐PCR positive (detected by nasopharyngeal swab during the acute phase), male convalescent patients, all with mild symptoms, were enrolled in serial blood sample collection for a longitudinal nAb titers and anti‐nucleocapsid (NP) antibodies (IgM, IgG and IgA) evaluation. NAbs were detected by a cytopathic effect‐based virus neutralization test (CPE‐based VNT), carried out with SARS‐CoV‐2 (GenBank: MT350282). RESULTS: A total of 78 male volunteers provided 316 samples, spanning a total of 4820 days of study. Although only 25% of donors kept nAb titers ≥160 within 100 days after the onset of disease, there was >75% probability of sustaining nAb titers ≥160 in volunteers whose initial nAb titer was ≥1280, weight ≥ 90 kg or obese, according to their body mass index (BMI), as evidenced by Kaplan–Meier analysis and Cox hazard regression (all p < .02). There was no correlation between the ABO group, ABO antibody titers and persistent high nAb titers. High IgG anti‐NP (S/CO ≥5.0) is a good surrogate for detecting nAb ≥ 160, defined by the ROC curve (sensitivity = 90.5%; CI95%: 84.5%–94.7%). CONCLUSION: Selection of CCP donors for multiple collections based on initial high nAb titers (≥1280) or BMI ≥ 30 kg/m(2) provides a simple strategy to achieve higher quality in CCP programs. High IgG anti‐NP levels can also be used as surrogate markers for high nAb screening.","Wendel, Silvano; Fontão‐Wendel, Rita; Fachini, Roberta; Candelaria, Gabriela; Scuracchio, Patricia; Achkar, Ruth; Brito, Mayra; Reis, Luiz Fernando; Camargo, Anamaria; Amano, Mariane; Machado, Rafael; Araujo, Danielle; Soares, Camila; Durigon, Edison",Transfusion,https://doi.org/10.1111/trf.16323; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33604884/,466
630765,Improving musculoskeletal health for children and young people – A ‘call to action’,2020-07-26,"INTRODUCTION: Physical distancing (PD) is an important public health strategy to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 and has been promoted by public health authorities through social media. Although youth have a tendency to engage in high-risk behaviors that could facilitate COVID-19 transmission, there is limited research on the characteristics of PD messaging targeting this population on social media platforms with which youth frequently engage. This study examined social media posts created by Canadian public health entities (PHEs) with PD messaging aimed at youth and young adults aged 16–29 years and reported behavioral change techniques (BCTs) used in these posts. METHODS: A content analysis of all social media posts of Canadian PHEs from Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube were conducted from April 1st to May 31st, 2020. Posts were classified as either implicitly or explicitly targeting youth and young adults. BCTs in social media posts were identified and classified based on Behavior Change Technique Taxonomy version 1 (BCTTv1). Frequency counts and proportions were used to describe the data. RESULTS: In total, 319 youth-targeted PD posts were identified. Over 43% of the posts originated from Ontario Regional public health units, and 36.4 and 32.6% of them were extracted from Twitter and Facebook, respectively. Only 5.3% of the total posts explicitly targeted youth. Explicit posts were most frequent from federal PHEs and posted on YouTube. Implicit posts elicited more interactions than explicit posts regardless of jurisdiction level or social media format. Three-quarters of the posts contained at least one BCT, with a greater portion of BCTs found within implicit posts (75%) than explicit posts (52.9%). The most common BCTs from explicit posts were instructions on how to perform a behavior (25.0%) and restructuring the social environment (18.8%). CONCLUSIONS: There is a need for more PD messaging that explicitly targets youth. BCTs should be used when designing posts to deliver public health messages and social media platforms should be selected depending on the target population.

631615,Seroprevalence of antibodies to the influenza A (H1N1) virus among healthcare workers prior to the 2009 pandemic peak,2012-01-25,"RATIONALE: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in 2019 has become a global pandemic. It is not known whether the disease is associated with a higher risk of infection in pregnant women or whether intrauterine vertical transmission can occur. We report 2 cases of pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19. PATIENT CONCERNS: In all of Yichang city from January 20, 2020, to April 9, 2020, only 2 pregnant women, who were in the late stage of pregnancy, were diagnosed with COVID-19; one patient was admitted for fever with limb asthenia, and the other patient was admitted for abnormal chest computed tomography results. DIAGNOSES: Both pregnant women were diagnosed with COVID-19. INTERVENTIONS: After the medical staff prepared for isolation and protection, the 2 pregnant women quickly underwent cesarean sections. A series of tests, such as laboratory, imaging, and SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid examinations, were performed on the 2 women with COVID-19 and their newborns. OUTCOMES: One of the 2 infected pregnant women had severe COVID-19, and the other had mild disease. Both babies were delivered by cesarean section. Both of the women with COVID-19 worsened 3 to 6 days after delivery. Chest computed tomography suggested that the lesions due to SARS-CoV-2 infection increased. These women began to exhibit fever or reduced blood oxygen saturation again. One of the 2 newborns was born prematurely, and the other was born at full term. Neither infant was infected with COVID-19, but both had increased prothrombin time and fibrinogen, lactate dehydrogenase, phosphocreatine kinase, and creatine kinase isoenzyme contents. LESSONS: SARS-CoV-2 infection was not found in the newborns born to the 2 pregnant women with COVID-19, but transient coagulation dysfunction and myocardial damage occurred in the 2 newborns. Effective management strategies for pregnant women with COVID-19 will help to control the outbreak of COVID-19 among pregnant women.","Zheng, Tingting; Guo, Jianqiang; He, Wencong; Wang, Hao; Yu, Huiling; Ye, Hong",Medicine (Baltimore),https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000021334; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32702930/,466
634099,Infection by rhinovirus: Similarity of clinical signs included in the case definition of influenza IAn/H1N1,2012-02-15,"BACKGROUND: The prescription of physical activity (PA) in clinical care has been advocated worldwide. This “exercise is medicine” (E=M) concept can be used to prevent, manage, and cure various lifestyle-related chronic diseases. Due to several challenges, E=M is not yet routinely implemented in clinical care. OBJECTIVE: This paper describes the rationale and design of the Physicians Implement Exercise = Medicine (PIE=M) study, which aims to facilitate the implementation of E=M in hospital care. METHODS: PIE=M consists of 3 interrelated work packages. First, levels and determinants of PA in different patient and healthy populations will be investigated using existing cohort data. The current implementation status, facilitators, and barriers of E=M will also be investigated using a mixed-methods approach among clinicians of participating departments from 2 diverse university medical centers (both located in a city, but one serving an urban population and one serving a more rural population). Implementation strategies will be connected to these barriers and facilitators using a systematic implementation mapping approach. Second, a generic E=M tool will be developed that will provide tailored PA prescription and referral. Requirements for this tool will be investigated among clinicians and department managers. The tool will be developed using an iterative design process in which all stakeholders reflect on the design of the E=M tool. Third, we will pilot-implement the set of implementation strategies, including the E=M tool, to test its feasibility in routine care of clinicians in these 2 university medical centers. An extensive learning process evaluation will be performed among clinicians, department managers, lifestyle coaches, and patients using a mixed-methods design based on the RE-AIM framework. RESULTS: This project was approved and funded by the Dutch grant provider ZonMW in April 2018. The project started in September 2018 and continues until December 2020 (depending on the course of the COVID-19 crisis). All data from the first work package have been collected and analyzed and are expected to be published in 2021. Results of the second work package are described. The manuscript is expected to be published in 2021. The third work package is currently being conducted in clinical practice in 4 departments of 2 university medical hospitals among clinicians, lifestyle coaches, hospital managers, and patients. Results are expected to be published in 2021. CONCLUSIONS: The PIE=M project addresses the potential of providing patients with PA advice to prevent and manage chronic disease, improve recovery, and enable healthy ageing by developing E=M implementation strategies, including an E=M tool, in routine clinical care. The PIE=M project will result in a blueprint of implementation strategies, including an E=M screening and referral tool, which aims to improve E=M referral by clinicians to improve patients’ health, while minimizing the burden on clinicians.","Krops, Leonie A; Bouma, Adrie J; Van Nassau, Femke; Nauta, Joske; van den Akker-Scheek, Inge; Bossers, Willem JR; Brügemann, Johan; Buffart, Laurien M; Diercks, Ronald L; De Groot, Vincent; De Jong, Johan; Kampshoff, Caroline S; Van der Leeden, Marike; Leutscher, Hans; Navis, Gerjan J; Scholtens, Salome; Stevens, Martin; Swertz, Morris A; Van Twillert, Sacha; Van der Velde, Joeri; Zwerver, Johannes; Van der Woude, Lucas HV; Van Mechelen, Willem; Verhagen, Evert ALM; Van Keeken, Helco G; Van der Ploeg, Hidde P; Dekker, Rienk",JMIR Res Protoc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33136060/; https://doi.org/10.2196/19397,466

COVID-19 related social distancing measures have required rapid shifts in care management, while easing of telehealth regulations has allowed for flexibility to approach RS differently. It is essential to learn from the RS telemedicine implementation experience, so that RSs can maintain care for this vulnerable and needy population. METHOD: This paper describes the successful telehealth conversion of a NYC-based, university affiliated RS that serves adults with severe mental illnesses (SMI; n = 64). Results focus on the telehealth acceptance rates of the subset of participants with CP (n = 23). RESULTS: The RS continued providing services including intake, care coordination, group psychotherapies, skills training groups, individual skills coaching, and vocational/educational supports. The telehealth conversion rates of the CP subsample indicated that 90% of CP patients accepted telehealth sessions and maintained their specific treatment plans in the virtual format. Mean comparisons between session attendance and cancellations/no-shows during the six-week period before and after telehealth conversion showed no significant differences in service utilization. DISCUSSION: RSs play an essential role in the treatment of CP and telehealth may prove to be a viable format of care delivery even after the COVID-19 crisis subsides. The multiple factors in the inner and outer treatment setting that contributed to successful conversion to telehealth will be considered along with the challenges that clinicians and patients encountered.","Lynch, David A.; Medalia, Alice; Saperstein, Alice",Front Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33101093/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.581149,466

However, the specific active compounds responsible for the individual pharmacological effects of in R. rugosa extract (95% EtOH) remain unknown. Here, we hypothesized that terpenoid structure, the most abundant constituents in R. rugosa extract, are responsible for its anti‐inflammatory activity. We investigated the phytochemical substituents (compounds 1–13) and newly purified 11‐methoxy polisin A, and 13‐methoxy bisaborosaol F using NMR and ESI‐MS and to screened their effects on NO production in LPS‐induced macrophages. Rugosic acid A (RA) induced to ameliorate NO production, iNOS, and pro‐inflammatory cytokines associated with the NF‐κB. And, RA suppressed IL‐6 secretion and IL‐6‐mediated STAT3 activation in LPS‐mediated inflammation. In addition, RA was evaluated in LPS‐mediated acute lung injury (ALI) model similar to acute pneumonia. Our results suggested that RA was suppressed to translocate nuclear NF‐κB and IL‐6‐mediated STAT3 activation. Finally, RA led to amelioration of ALI by decreasing myeloperoxidase (MPO) and inhibiting phosphorylation of NF‐κB and STAT3. Our group originally found that R. rugosa extract had new methoxy compounds and RA may be alternative natural agent for acute pneumonia similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome by coronavirus.","Kim, Kang‐Hoon; Park, Ye‐Ji; Jang, Hyun‐Jae; Lee, Seung‐Jae; Lee, Soyoung; Yun, Bong‐Sik; Lee, Seung Woong; Rho, Mun‐Chual",Phytother Res,https://doi.org/10.1002/ptr.6767; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32779813/,466

However, finding quantitative definitions for order, complexity, information and functionality of living systems remains a challenge. Here, we review and develop insights into this problem from the concept of the biotic regulation of the environment developed by Victor Gorshkov (1935–2019). Life’s extraordinary persistence—despite being a strongly non-equilibrium process—requires a quantum-classical duality: the program of life is written in molecules and thus can be copied without information loss, while life’s interaction with its non-equilibrium environment is performed by macroscopic classical objects (living individuals) that age. Life’s key energetic parameter, the volume-specific rate of energy consumption, is maintained within universal limits by most life forms. Contrary to previous suggestions, it cannot serve as a proxy for “evolutionary progress”. In contrast, ecosystem-level surface-specific energy consumption declines with growing animal body size in stable ecosystems. High consumption by big animals is associated with instability. We suggest that the evolutionary increase in body size may represent a spontaneous loss of information about environmental regulation, a manifestation of life’s algorithm ageing as a whole.","Makarieva, Anastassia M.; Nefiodov, Andrei V.; Li, Bai-Lian",Entropy (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33286794/; https://doi.org/10.3390/e22091025,466

656134,Confinement et continuité des soins : focus sur le diabétique tunisien,2020-09-30,"The hepatitis B virus X protein (HBV-X) is a multifunctional regulatory protein associated with the pathogenesis of liver disease in chronic HBV infection. Basal core promoter mutations (BCP), associated with the clinical course of chronic HBV infection, affect HBV-X at 130–131 positions. The role of these mutations on HBV-X biological activity remains largely unknown. The aim of this study was to analyze the impact of the presence of different amino acids at 130–131 positions of HBV-X on the biological activity of the protein. Transient expression of wild type and mutant F1b and F4 HBV-X increased cell mortality by the induction of apoptosis in human hepatoma cells. The wild type and mutant HBV-X differentially modulate the expression of pro-apoptotic (Bax) and anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2 and Bcl-X) regulatory proteins of the Bcl-2 family. Furthermore, the expression of HBV-X variants of both subgenotypes induced autophagy of human tumoral hepatocytes. In conclusion, HBV-X variants of the Latin American HBV F genotype promotes human hepatocytes death by the induction of apoptosis and autophagy. The results of this work describe some of the molecular mechanisms by which HBV-X variants contribute to the pathogenesis of liver diseases in the infected liver and help to the biological characterization of genotype F, responsible of the majority of HBV infections in Argentina.","Elizalde, María Mercedes; Campos, Rodolfo Héctor; Barbini, Luciana",Virus Res,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170217305464; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2017.09.025; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170217305464; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28986109/,466

To assess the association between renin–angiotensin system inhibitors (RASIs) and disease progression and critical outcomes. METHODS AND RESULTS: All consecutive hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in a university hospital in Amiens (France) were included in this study. The primary composite endpoint was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) or death before ICU admission. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were used to identify factors associated with the composite endpoint. Between 28 February 2020 and 30 March 2020, a total of 499 local patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Of these, 231 were not hospitalized {males 33%; median [interquartile range (IQR)] age: 44 (32–54)}, and 268 were hospitalized [males 58%; median (IQR) age: 73 (61–84)]. A total of 116 patients met the primary endpoint: 47 died before ICU admission, and 69 were admitted to the ICU. Patients meeting the primary endpoint were more likely than patients not meeting the primary endpoint to have coronary heart disease and to have been taking RASIs; however, the two subsets of patients did not differ with regard to median age. After adjustment for other associated variables, the risk of meeting the composite endpoint was 1.73 times higher (odds ratio 1.73, 95% confidence interval 1.02–2.93) in patients treated at baseline with a RASI than in patients not treated with this drug class. This association was confirmed when the analysis was restricted to patients treated with antihypertensive agents. CONCLUSIONS: We highlighted a potential safety signal for RASIs, the long-term use of which was independently associated with a higher risk of severe COVID-19 and a poor outcome. Due to the widespread use of this important drug class, formal proof based on clinical trials is needed to better understand the association between RASIs and complications of COVID-19.","Liabeuf, Sophie; Moragny, Julien; Bennis, Youssef; Batteux, Benjamin; Brochot, Etienne; Schmit, Jean Luc; Lanoix, Jean-Philippe; Andrejak, Claire; Ganry, Olivier; Slama, Michel; Maizel, Julien; Mahjoub, Yazine; Masmoudi, Kamel; Gras-Champel, Valérie",Eur Heart J Cardiovasc Pharmacother,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32531040/; https://doi.org/10.1093/ehjcvp/pvaa062,466

We describe the epidemiology, clinical course, and virologic characteristics of the first 12 U.S. patients with COVID-19. Methods: We collected demographic, exposure, and clinical information from 12 patients confirmed by CDC during January 20-February 5, 2020 to have COVID-19. Respiratory, stool, serum, and urine specimens were submitted for SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR testing, virus culture, and whole genome sequencing. Results: Among the 12 patients, median age was 53 years (range: 21-68); 8 were male, 10 had traveled to China, and two were contacts of patients in this series. Commonly reported signs and symptoms at illness onset were fever (n=7) and cough (n=8). Seven patients were hospitalized with radiographic evidence of pneumonia and demonstrated clinical or laboratory signs of worsening during the second week of illness. Three were treated with the investigational antiviral remdesivir. All patients had SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected in respiratory specimens, typically for 2-3 weeks after illness onset, with lowest rRT-PCR Ct values often detected in the first week. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected after reported symptom resolution in seven patients. SARS-CoV-2 was cultured from respiratory specimens, and SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in stool from 7/10 patients. Conclusions: In 12 patients with mild to moderately severe illness, SARS-CoV-2 RNA and viable virus were detected early, and prolonged RNA detection suggests the window for diagnosis is long.

Wastewater-based epidemiology was employed using metagenomics and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays to identify enteric and non-enteric viruses collected from a large urban area for potential public health monitoring and outbreak analysis. Untreated wastewater samples were collected from November 2017 to February 2018 (n = 54) to evaluate the diversity of human viral pathogens in collected samples. Viruses were classified into virus types based on primary transmission routes and reviewed against viral associated diseases reported in the catchment area. Metagenomics detected the presence of viral pathogens that cause clinically significant diseases reported within the study area during the sampling year. Detected viruses belong to the Adenoviridae, Astroviridae, Caliciviridae, Coronaviridae, Flaviviridae, Hepeviridae, Herpesviridae, Matonaviridae, Papillomaviridae, Parvoviridae, Picornaviridae, Poxviridae, Retroviridae, and Togaviridae families. Furthermore, concentrations of adenovirus, norovirus GII, sapovirus, hepatitis A virus, human herpesvirus 6, and human herpesvirus 8 were measured in wastewater samples and compared to metagenomic findings to confirm detected viral genus. Hepatitis A virus obtained the greatest average viral load (1.86 × 10(7) genome copies/L) in wastewater samples compared to other viruses quantified using qPCR with a 100% detection rate in metagenomic samples. Average concentration of sapovirus (1.36 × 10(6) genome copies/L) was significantly greater than norovirus GII (2.94 × 10(4) genome copies/L) indicating a higher burden within the study area. Findings obtained from this study aid in evaluating the utility of wastewater-based epidemiology for identification and routine monitoring of various viruses in large communities. This methodology has the potential to improve public health responses to large scale outbreaks and viral pandemics.","McCall, Camille; Wu, Huiyun; Miyani, Brijen; Xagoraraki, Irene",Water Res,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2020.116160; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0043135420306977?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0043135420306977; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32738707/,466

So, the search for an effective and active option for the treatment of COVID-19 is still a big challenge. The Spike protein (S), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and Main protease (Mpro) are considered to be the primary therapeutic drug target for COVID-19. In this study we have screened the drugbank compound library against the Main Protease. But our search was not limited to just Mpro. Like other viruses, SARS-CoV-2, have also acquired unique mutations. These mutations within the active site of these target proteins may be an important factor hindering effective drug candidate development. In the present study we identified important active site mutations within the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro (Y54C, N142S, T190I and A191V). Further the drugbank database was computationally screened against Mpro and the selected mutants. Finally, we came up with the common molecules effective against the wild type (WT) and all the selected Mpro. The study found Imiglitazar, was found to be the most active compound against the wild type of Mpro. While PF-03715455 (Y54C), Salvianolic acid A (N142S and T190I), and Montelukast (A191V) were found to be most active against the other selected mutants. It was also found that some other compounds such as Acteoside, 4-Amino-N- {4-[2-(2,6-Dimethyl-Phenoxy)-Acetylamino]-3-Hydroxy-1-Isobutyl-5-Phenyl-Pentyl}-Benzamide, PF-00610355, 4-Amino-N-4-[2-(2,6-Dimethyl-Phenoxy)-Acetylamino]-3-Hydroxy-1-Isobutyl-5-Phenyl-Pentyl}-Benzamide and Atorvastatin were showing high efficacy against the WT as well as other selected mutants. We believe that these molecules will provide a better and effective option for the treatment of COVID-19 clinical manifestations.","Sharma, Tanuj; Abohashrh, Mohammed; Baig, Mohammad Hassan; Dong, Jae-Jun; Alam, Mohammad Mahtab; Ahmad, Irfan; Irfan, Safia",Saudi J Biol Sci,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1319562X21001327; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1319562X21001327?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sjbs.2021.02.059; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33649700/,466
677194,Une cardiologie entre deux virus,2021-07-07,"In addition to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), humans are also susceptible to six other coronaviruses, for which consecutive exposures to antigenically related and divergent seasonal coronaviruses are frequent. Despite the prevalence of COVID-19 pandemic and ongoing research, the nature of the antibody response against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is unclear. Here we longitudinally profile the early humoral immune response against SARS-CoV-2 in hospitalized coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients and quantify levels of pre-existing immunity to OC43, HKU1 and 229E seasonal coronaviruses, and find a strong back-boosting effect to conserved but not variable regions of OC43 and HKU1 betacoronaviruses spike protein. However, such antibody memory boost to human coronaviruses negatively correlates with the induction of IgG and IgM against SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid protein. Our findings thus provide evidence of immunological imprinting by previous seasonal coronavirus infections that can potentially modulate the antibody profile to SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Aydillo, Teresa; Rombauts, Alexander; Stadlbauer, Daniel; Aslam, Sadaf; Abelenda-Alonso, Gabriela; Escalera, Alba; Amanat, Fatima; Jiang, Kaijun; Krammer, Florian; Carratala, Jordi; García-Sastre, Adolfo",Nat Commun,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-23977-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34145263/,466
678828,Spanish SMEs’ digitalization enablers: E-Receipt applications to the offline retail market,2020-10-15,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has affected lives of billions of individuals, globally. There is an urgent need to develop interventions including vaccines to control the ongoing pandemic. RECENT FINDINGS: Development of tools for fast-tracked testing including small and large animal models for vaccine efficacy analysis, assays for immunogenicity assessment, critical reagents, international biological standards, and data sharing allowed accelerated development of vaccines. More than 300 vaccines are under development and 9 of them are approved for emergency use in various countries, with impressive efficacy ranging from 50 to 95%. Recently, several new SARS-CoV-2 variants have emerged and are circulating globally, and preliminary findings imply that some of them may escape immune responses against previous variants and diminish efficacy of current vaccines. Most of these variants acquired new mutations in their surface protein (Spike) which is the antigen in most of the approved/under development vaccines. SUMMARY: In this review, we summarize novel and traditional approaches for COVID-19 vaccine development including inactivated, attenuated, nucleic acid, vector and protein based. Critical assessment of humoral and cell-mediated immune responses induced by vaccines has shown comparative immunogenicity profiles of various vaccines in clinical phases. Recent reports confirmed that some currently available vaccines provide partial to complete protection against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. If more mutated variants emerge, current vaccines might need to be updated accordingly either by developing vaccines matching the circulating strain or designing multivalent vaccines to extend the breadth.","Kumar, Arun; Dowling, William E.; Román, Raúl Gómez; Chaudhari, Amol; Gurry, Celine; Le, Tung Thanh; Tollefson, Stig; Clark, Carolyn E; Bernasconi, Valentina; Kristiansen, Paul A",Curr Infect Dis Rep,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11908-021-00752-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33867863/,466
684058,Les conséquences du confinement sur les maladies cardiovasculaires,2021-02-25,"INTRODUCTION: The wellbeing of front‐line healthcare workers can be impacted during a pandemic. This paper reports the initial impact on the wellbeing of COVID‐19 on Australasian sonographers. METHODS: An online qualitative and quantitative survey was conducted between March and June 2020 to explore the wellbeing of Australasian sonographers in the early stages of the COVID‐19 pandemic. RESULTS: Whilst most sonographers felt supported at work (300/379), those working in public hospitals felt more so than those in private practice. Sonographers in private practice felt more as though their job was at risk and were more likely to consider an alternate source of income. Sonographers felt they were working on the front line and many felt anxious about themselves (74%) or family (78%) contracting COVID‐19 due to their employment. Forty‐one percent of sonographers felt more isolated than normal, with younger age groups (18‐34 years) feeling less like they had enough hobbies or selfcare activities to get them through. Twelve percent of sonographers reported never, or rarely, coping with the juggle of work and home life. CONCLUSION: The initial impact of the COVID‐19 pandemic on the wellbeing of sonographers is evident. Longitudinal data will enable wellbeing to be tracked over time.","Childs, Jessie; Osborne, Brooke; Lamb, Kathryn; Maranna, Sandhya; Esterman, Adrian",Sonography,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34540562/; https://doi.org/10.1002/sono.12264,466
