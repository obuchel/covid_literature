531,A Canadian Critical Care Trials Group project in collaboration with the international forum for acute care trialists - Collaborative H1N1 Adjuvant Treatment pilot trial (CHAT): study protocol and design of a randomized controlled trial,2011-03-09,"BACKGROUND: Swine origin influenza A/H1N1 infection (H1N1) emerged in early 2009 and rapidly spread to humans. For most infected individuals, symptoms were mild and self-limited; however, a small number developed a more severe clinical syndrome characterized by profound respiratory failure with hospital mortality ranging from 10 to 30%. While supportive care and neuraminidase inhibitors are the main treatment for influenza, data from observational and interventional studies suggest that the course of influenza can be favorably influenced by agents not classically considered as influenza treatments. Multiple observational studies have suggested that HMGCoA reductase inhibitors (statins) can exert a class effect in attenuating inflammation. The Collaborative H1N1 Adjuvant Treatment (CHAT) Pilot Trial sought to investigate the feasibility of conducting a trial during a global pandemic in critically ill patients with H1N1 with the goal of informing the design of a larger trial powered to determine impact of statins on important outcomes. METHODS/DESIGN: A multi-national, pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) of once daily enteral rosuvastatin versus matched placebo administered for 14 days for the treatment of critically ill patients with suspected, probable or confirmed H1N1 infection. We propose to randomize 80 critically ill adults with a moderate to high index of suspicion for H1N1 infection who require mechanical ventilation and have received antiviral therapy for ≤ 72 hours. Site investigators, research coordinators and clinical pharmacists will be blinded to treatment assignment. Only research pharmacy staff will be aware of treatment assignment. We propose several approaches to informed consent including a priori consent from the substitute decision maker (SDM), waived and deferred consent. The primary outcome of the CHAT trial is the proportion of eligible patients enrolled in the study. Secondary outcomes will evaluate adherence to medication administration regimens, the proportion of primary and secondary endpoints collected, the number of patients receiving open-label statins, consent withdrawals and the effect of approved consent models on recruitment rates. DISCUSSION: Several aspects of study design including the need to include central randomization, preserve allocation concealment, ensure study blinding compare to a matched placebo and the use novel consent models pose challenges to investigators conducting pandemic research. Moreover, study implementation requires that trial design be pragmatic and initiated in a short time period amidst uncertainty regarding the scope and duration of the pandemic.

978,The expression of nicotinic receptor alpha7 during cochlear development,2012-08-23,"Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha7 expression was examined in the developing and adult auditory system using mice that were modified through homologous recombination to coexpress either GFP (alpha7GFP) or Cre (alpha7Cre), respectively. The expression of alpha7GFP is first detected at embryonic (E) day E13.5 in cells of the spiral prominence. By E14.5, sensory regions including the putative outer hair cells and Deiters' cells express alpha7GFP as do solitary efferent fibers. This pattern diminishes after E16.5 in a basal to apex progression, as Hensen's cells and cells of the spiral ligament acquire alpha7GFP expression. At birth and thereafter alpha7GFP also identifies a subset of spiral ganglion cells whose processes terminate on inner hair cells. Efferent fibers identified by peripherin or calcitonin gene-related protein do not coexpress alpha7GFP. In addition to cochlear structures, there is strong expression of alpha7GFP by cells of the central auditory pathways including the ventral posterior cochlear nucleus, lateral lemniscus, central inferior colliculus, and the medial geniculate nucleus. Our findings suggest that alpha7 expression by both neuronal and non-neuronal cells has the potential to impact multiple auditory functions through mechanisms that are not traditionally attributed to this receptor.","Rogers, Scott W; Myers, Elizabeth J; Gahring, Lorise C",Brain Behav,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3489815/,254
1381,Utilization of and Direct Expenditure for Emergency Medical Care in Taiwan: A Population-based Descriptive Study,2009-01-30,"BACKGROUND: We surveyed the emergency medical system (EMS) in Taiwan to provide information to policymakers responsible for decisions regarding the redistribution of national medical resources. METHODS: A systematic sampling method was used to randomly sample a representative database from the National Health Insurance (NHI) database in Taiwan, during the period from 2000 to 2004. RESULTS: We identified 10,124, 10,408, 11,209, 10,686, and 11,914 emergency room visits in 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, and 2004, respectively. There were more males than females, and the majority of adults were younger than 50 years. Diagnose of injury/poisoning was the most frequently noted diagnostic category in emergency departments (EDs) in Taiwan. There were 13,196 (24.3%) and 2,952 (5.4%) patients with 2 and 3 concomitant diagnoses, respectively. There was a significant association between advanced age and the existence of multiple diagnoses (P < 0.001). With the exception of the ill-defined symptoms/signs/conditions, the two most frequent diagnoses were diseases of the circulatory system and diseases of the respiratory system in patients aged 65 years or older. On average, treatment-associated expenditure and drug-associated expenditure in Taiwan EDs averaged NT$1,155 ($35.0) and NT$190 ($5.8), respectively, which was equal to 64.5% and 10.6% of the total ED-associated cost. General ED medical expenditure increased with patient age; the increased cost ratio due to age was estimated at 8% per year (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of major health problems diagnosed at ED visits varied by age: more complicated complaints and multiple diagnoses were more frequent in older patients. In Taiwan, the ED system remains overloaded, possibly because of the low cost of an ED visit.","Yang, Nan-Ping; Lee, Yi-Hui; Lin, Ching-Heng; Chung, Yuan-Chang; Chen, Wen-Jone; Chou, Pesus",J Epidemiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3924095/,254
2218,Role of preprocedural rinse and high volume evacuator in reducing bacterial contamination in bioaerosols,2016,"CONTEXT: Microbial contamination, which occurs during dental procedures, has been a potential threat to dental professionals and individuals. There has been a growing concern over the role of bioaerosols in spread of various airborne infections and also to reduce the risk of bioaerosol contamination. AIMS: This study was to analyze the number of colony forming units (CFUs) in bioaerosols generated during ultrasonic scaling procedure as well as to evaluate the efficacy of chlorhexidine 0.12% (CHX) preprocedural mouth rinse and high volume evacuator (HVE) in minimizing the bioaerosol contamination. METHODS: About 45 individuals were divided into three Groups A, B and C. These groups underwent ultrasonic scaling before and after the use of CHX (0.12%), HVE and combination of CHX (0.12%) and HVE. Bioaerosols were collected on blood agar plates which were incubated at 37°C for 48 h, and the CFUs were counted with manual colony counting device. A comparison was also done between A versus B, B versus C and A versus C groups. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Student's t-test. RESULTS: We found a significant reduction in the CFUs when CHX (0.12%) preprocedural rinse (P < 0), or HVE (P < 0.001) or combination of both CHX (0.12%) and HVE were employed (P < 0.001). Maximum reduction in CFUs was observed when CHX (0.12%) and HVE were used in combination as compared to their individual use. A moderate significance was seen between A versus C groups but not with B versus C groups and A versus B groups. CONCLUSION: From our study, we conclude that individual methods such as CHX (0.12%) and HVE were useful to reduce the dental bioaerosols; however, combination of both CHX (0.12%) and HVE is more efficient to reduce dental bioaerosols than individual method.","Narayana, TV; Mohanty, Leeky; Sreenath, G; Vidhyadhari, Pavani",J Oral Maxillofac Pathol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4860938/,254
4142,Intensive Care Unit Relocation and Its Effect on Multidrug-Resistant Respiratory Microorganisms,2018-11-14,"BACKGROUND: Infection by multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens leads to poor patient outcomes in intensive care units (ICUs). Contact precautions are necessary to reduce the transmission of MDR pathogens. However, the importance of the surrounding environment is not well known. We studied the effects of ICU relocation on MDR respiratory pathogen detection rates and patient outcomes. METHODS: Patients admitted to the ICU before and after the relocation were retrospectively analyzed. Baseline patient characteristics, types of respiratory pathogens detected, antibiotics used, and patient outcomes were measured. RESULTS: A total of 463 adult patients admitted to the ICU, 4 months before and after the relocation, were included. Of them, 234 were admitted to the ICU before the relocation and 229 afterward. Baseline characteristics, including age, sex, and underlying comorbidities, did not differ between the two groups. After the relocation, the incidence rate of MDR respiratory pathogen detection decreased from 90.0 to 68.8 cases per 1,000 patient-days, but that difference was statistically insignificant. The use of colistin was significantly reduced from 53.5 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 20.3 to 86.7 days) to 18.7 days (95% CI, 5.6 to 31.7 days). Furthermore, the duration of hospital stay was significantly reduced from a median of 29 days (interquartile range [IQR], 14 to 50 days) to 21 days (IQR, 11 to 39 days). CONCLUSIONS: Incidence rates of MDR respiratory pathogen detection were not significantly different before and after ICU relocation. However, ICU relocation could be helpful in reducing the use of antibiotics against MDR pathogens and improving patient outcomes.","Kim, Hyung-Jun; Jeong, EuiSeok; Choe, Pyoeng Gyun; Lee, Sang-Min; Lee, Jinwoo",Acute Crit Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6849029/,254
4517,Focus on chest trauma: implications from clinical and experimental studies,2020-02-17,"BACKGROUND: Usage of chloroquine was discontinued from the treatment of Plasmodium falciparum infection in almost all endemic regions because of global spread of resistant parasites. Since the first report in Malawi, numerous epidemiological studies have demonstrated that the discontinuance led to re-emergence of chloroquine-susceptible P. falciparum, suggesting a possible role in future malaria control. However, most studies were cross-sectional, with few studies looking at the persistence of chloroquine recovery in long term. This study fills the gap by providing, for a period of at least 6 years, proof of persistent re-emergence/stable recovery of susceptible parasite populations using both molecular and phenotypic methods. METHODS: Ex vivo drug-susceptibility assays to chloroquine (n = 319) and lumefantrine (n = 335) were performed from 2013 to 2018 in Gulu, Northern Uganda, where chloroquine had been removed from the official malaria treatment regimen since 2006. Genotyping of pfcrt and pfmdr1 was also performed. RESULTS: Chloroquine resistance (≥ 100 nM) was observed in only 3 (1.3%) samples. Average IC(50) values for chloroquine were persistently low throughout the study period (17.4–24.9 nM). Parasites harbouring pfcrt K76 alleles showed significantly lower IC(50)s to chloroquine than the parasites harbouring K76T alleles (21.4 nM vs. 43.1 nM, p-value = 3.9 × 10(−8)). Prevalence of K76 alleles gradually increased from 71% in 2013 to 100% in 2018. CONCLUSION: This study found evidence of stable persistence of chloroquine susceptibility with the fixation of pfcrt K76 in Northern Uganda after discontinuation of chloroquine in the region. Accumulation of similar evidence in other endemic areas in Uganda could open channels for possible future re-use of chloroquine as an option for malaria treatment or prevention.","Balikagala, Betty; Sakurai-Yatsushiro, Miki; Tachibana, Shin-Ichiro; Ikeda, Mie; Yamauchi, Masato; Katuro, Osbert T.; Ntege, Edward H.; Sekihara, Makoto; Fukuda, Naoyuki; Takahashi, Nobuyuki; Yatsushiro, Shouki; Mori, Toshiyuki; Hirai, Makoto; Opio, Walter; Obwoya, Paul S.; Anywar, Denis A.; Auma, Mary A.; Palacpac, Nirianne M.

10654,Qualitative Study to Understand Pediatric Hospitalists and Emergency Medicine Physicians’ Perspectives of Clinical Pathways,2020-03-25,"INTRODUCTION: Accurate and timely documentation of pediatric early warning scores (PEWS) by the bedside nurse into the electronic health record (EHR) is important to promote early identification of patients in stages of deterioration. Through the implementation of a PEWS calculator embedded in the EHR, we hope to improve the accuracy of the recorded score and reduce the time between vital sign collection and final documentation in the EHR. METHODS: Identification of the highest PEWS value in the 24 hours before all unplanned transfers or rapid response activations without a transfer occurred between the period November 1, 2013, through December 31, 2016. The accuracy of the calculated cardiac or respiratory subscore based on heart rate or the respiratory rate at the time of PEWS calculation was determined. We tracked the calculation of the time to chart via the difference between nursing documentation of PEWS compared to vital sign collection. Before September 3, 2015, PEWS was calculated mentally by the bedside nurse; afterward, the nurse entered the unique PEWS features into the EHR, and the EHR automatically calculated PEWS. RESULTS: This study evaluated 2,409 PEWS scores, 1,411 before and 998 after initiation of the PEWS calculator. Accuracy before the EHR calculator was 71%, and the median time to document was 55 minutes. Following the implementation of the calculator, no scores were incorrectly calculated too low, and the median time to document was 20 minutes. CONCLUSIONS: Transition to an EHR-based PEWS calculator eliminated inaccurately low PEWS values and reduced time to document.","Dean, Nathan P.; Cheng, Jenhao J.; Crumbley, Ian; DuVal, Jennifer; Maldonado, Eliana; Ghebremariam, Emanuel",Pediatr Qual Saf,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7190257/,254
10994,Do not drink and lyse: alcohol intoxication increases fibrinolysis shutdown in injured patients,2020-03-10,"Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and late-onset sepsis (LOS) are two major contributors to death among preterm infants. Oropharyngeal administration of colostrum (OAC) has been proved as an easy, safe, and economically viable technique to help preterm neonates to build up their immunity. In this review, we assessed the effects of OAC on preterm infants. Several mainstream databases were searched including PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and a website of clinical trials. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing OAC vs. placebo or no intervention in preterm infants (gestation age <34 weeks or birth weight <1500 g) were eligible. Overall, nine RCTs (n = 689) were included in the review. Meta-analysis showed no statistical significance in terms of the incidence of NEC (RR = 0.59, 95% CI = 0.33–1.06, p = 0.08), LOS (RR = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.60–1.03, p = 0.08) and mortality rate (RR = 0.63, 95% CI = 0.38–1.05, p = 0.07). No significant difference was found in the subgroup analysis, apart from the group of the undeveloped region in NEC and mortality. In addition, time was significantly reduced in terms of achieving full enteral feeding (MD = −3.60, 95% CI = −6.55–0.64, p = 0.02) and hospital stay (MD = −10.38, 95% CI = −18.47–2.29, p = 0.01). The results show that OAC does not reduce the incidences of NEC, LOS, and death in preterm infants, but there is a trend toward a positive effect. It is therefore recommended as routine care for preterm infants in the NICU.","Tao, Jiaxin; Mao, Jing; Yang, Jixin; Su, Yanwei",Eur J Clin Nutr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7222151/,254
11055,Influence of a temporary stabilization device on respiratory status in patients with severe trauma with a femoral shaft fracture treated by damage control strategy,2020-01-17,"BACKGROUND: Utilization of intracranial pressure monitors (ICPMs) has not been consistently shown to improve mortality in patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). A single-center analysis concluded that venous thromboembolism (VTE) chemoprophylaxis (CP) posed no significant bleeding risk in patients following ICPM implementation; however, there is still debate about the optimal use and timing of CP in patients with ICPMs for fear of worsening intracranial hemorrhage. We hypothesized that ICPM use is associated with increased time to VTE CP and thus increased VTE in patients with severe TBI. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of the Trauma Quality Improvement Program (2010–2016) was performed to compare severe TBI patients with and without ICPMs. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was completed. RESULTS: From 35,673 patients with severe TBI, 12,487 (35%) had an ICPM. Those with ICPMs had a higher rate of VTE CP (64.3% vs. 49.4%, p < 0.001) but a longer median time to CP initiation (5 vs. 4 days, p < 0.001) as well as a longer hospital length of stay (LOS) (18 vs. 9 days, p < 0.001) compared to those without ICPMs. After adjusting for covariates, ICPM use was found to be associated with a higher risk of VTE (9.2% vs 4.3%, OR = 1.75, CI = 1.42–2.15, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Compared to patients without ICPMs, those with ICPMs had a longer delay to initiation of CP leading to an increase in VTE. In addition, there was a nearly two-fold higher associated risk for VTE in patients with ICPMs even when controlling for known VTE risk factors. Improved adherence to initiation of CP in the setting of ICPMs may help decrease the associated risk of VTE with ICPMs.","Allen, Angela; Grigorian, Areg; Christian, Ashton; Schubl, Sebastian D.; Barrios, Cristobal; Lekawa, Michael; Borazjani, Borris; Joe, Victor; Nahmias, Jeffry",Eur J Trauma Emerg Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7222950/,254

11391,Does lack of thoracic trauma attenuate the severity of pulmonary failure? An 8-year analysis of critically injured patients,2019-02-02,"Invasins and intimins, members of virulence-related adhesin family which is involved in attachment and adherence to epithelial cells during infection, are found in various pathogens. These pathogens can attach to enterocytes and lead to the formation of a pedestal-like structure. Invasins and intimins belong to type Ve secretion systems, and the N-terminal β-barrel domain acts as a translocation pore to secrete the C-terminal passenger domain. However, the relationship between invasins/intimins and type III secretion system (T3SS) has been poorly studied. Based on the transposon insertion mutant library of Edwardsiella piscicida, we got a transposon insertion mutant with significant T3SS defect and identified the mutated gene ETAE_0323 (named inV later). This gene encoded a protein with 2359 amino acid residues and was predicted to be an invasin. To study the relationship between InV and T3SS, strains with N-terminus or C-terminus deleted InV fragments were made. However, none of them was able to copy the phenotype of the transposon insertion mutant previously identified. The localization of InV in ΔT3SS strain was not significantly different from WT, suggesting that the T3SS defect in the transposon insertion mutant was likely to be caused by polar effect. Nevertheless, depletion of inV still showed dramatic internalization and virulence defect in HeLa cell and zebrafish model, respectively, suggesting InV as a virulence related protein.","Han, Yu; Wei, Lifan; Xiao, Jingfan; Zhang, Yuanxing; Wang, Qiyao; Zhou, Mian",Arch Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223825/,254

It is important to validate whether published normal ocular parameters are consistent with the alpaca population in the UK. METHODS: Ophthalmic examinations were performed on healthy alpacas (Vicugna pacos) from three farms in East Anglia, UK. RESULTS: On direct ophthalmoscopy of 35 alpacas, there was a 50 per cent prevalence of opacities within the lens in alpacas older than two years old (n=8/16). There was a 36.8 per cent prevalence of persistent hyaloid arteries in alpacas under two years old (n=7/19). The mean Schirmer tear test-1 value was 20.0 ±6 mm/minute (n=40). The mean intraocular pressure measured by rebound tonometry was 17.2 ±5.5 mmHg (n=46), and applanation tonometry resulted in statistically similar values (P=0.30; n=25). There was a significant variation in intraocular pressure throughout a 24-hour period (n=8). Fluorescein dye was not detected at the nostrils of any of the alpacas which underwent a Jones test to assess nasolacrimal duct patency (n=8). CONCLUSION: The ophthalmic findings appear largely consistent with previously published values from North America and continental Europe.

12546,Morbidity and mortality of Hispanic trauma patients with diabetes mellitus,2018-11-26,"Saturation mutagenesis constitutes a powerful method in the directed evolution of enzymes. Traditional protocols of whole plasmid amplification such as Stratagene’s QuikChange™ sometimes fail when the templates are difficult to amplify. In order to overcome such restrictions, we have devised a simple two-primer, two-stage polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method which constitutes an improvement over existing protocols. In the first stage of the PCR, both the mutagenic primer and the antiprimer that are not complementary anneal to the template. In the second stage, the amplified sequence is used as a megaprimer. Sites composed of one or more residues can be randomized in a single PCR reaction, irrespective of their location in the gene sequence.The method has been applied to several enzymes successfully, including P450-BM3 from Bacillus megaterium, the lipases from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida antarctica and the epoxide hydrolase from Aspergillus niger. Here, we show that megaprimer size as well as the direction and design of the antiprimer are determining factors in the amplification of the plasmid.

Missing natural foods in the diet raise the need of biologically active food components that could compensate for this deficiency and help maintain proper immune status. In this study, the microbial changes in pigs as experimental animals were assessed as influenced by consumption of oregano extract combination with peppermint and thyme essential oils. The results demonstrated that the combination of plant extracts had a positive effect on the gastrointestinal tract of animals by increasing the number of probiotic bacteria. Based on the results obtained it may be outlined that the combination of oregano extract and peppermint and thyme essential oils can be promising ingredient as a functional component for the development of the new nutraceutical preparation. ABSTRACT: In recent years, the intake of ultra-processed foods has increased dramatically worldwide. Missing natural foods in the diet raise the need of biologically active food components that could compensate for this deficiency and help maintain proper immune status. This study used pigs as an animal model for the assessment of the impact of consumption of Origanum vulgare plant extract combined with Mentha piperita and Thymus vulgaris essential oils on microbial profile in intestines. A single group of weaned pigs received basal diet, while the other group basal diet supplemented with plant extract and two essential oils in the form of bilayer tablets prepared using “liquid/solid” phase technology. Metagenomic sequencing was performed with the aim to investigate changes of microbial communities in ileum, caecum, and colon. The results demonstrated that the combination of essential oils was non cytotoxic, and had a positive effect on the microbial composition in the large intestine of pigs due to significant increase in the number of probiotic bacteria. The amount of Lactobacillus was 2.5 times and Bifidobacterium 1.9 times higher in the animal group fed with supplement. The combination, however, had some negative impact on the variety of minor species in the distal part of the ileum. Additional studies need to be performed to obtain knowledge on how combinations of essential oils can change bacterial variety in the proximal part of the gastrointestinal tract.","Ruzauskas, Modestas; Bartkiene, Elena; Stankevicius, Arunas; Bernatoniene, Jurga; Zadeike, Daiva; Lele, Vita; Starkute, Vytaute; Zavistanaviciute, Paulina; Grigas, Juozas; Zokaityte, Egle; Pautienius, Arnoldas; Juodeikiene, Grazina; Jakstas, Valdas",Animals (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7598605/,254

We describe the development and evaluation of a system to automatically find and categorize all new RCT reports. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Trialstreamer continuously monitors PubMed and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, looking for new RCTs in humans using a validated classifier. We combine machine learning and rule-based methods to extract information from the RCT abstracts, including free-text descriptions of trial PICO (populations, interventions/comparators, and outcomes) elements and map these snippets to normalized MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) vocabulary terms. We additionally identify sample sizes, predict the risk of bias, and extract text conveying key findings. We store all extracted data in a database, which we make freely available for download, and via a search portal, which allows users to enter structured clinical queries. Results are ranked automatically to prioritize larger and higher-quality studies. RESULTS: As of early June 2020, we have indexed 673 191 publications of RCTs, of which 22 363 were published in the first 5 months of 2020 (142 per day). We additionally include 304 111 trial registrations from the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. The median trial sample size was 66.

Maternal outcomes, pregnancy outcomes and fetal outcomes were studied. RESULTS: Mean period of gestation was 31.89 ± 7.31 weeks. Thrombocytopenia was seen in 23 (52.3%) women. Of 40 women, 10 (25%) developed post-partum haemorrhage. The incidence of maternal systemic complications was high: eight (18.2%) women developed acute kidney injury and two (4.5%) required haemodialysis support; eight (18.2%) women developed ARDS and seven (15.9%) women required ventilatory support; four (9.1%) women developed acute liver failure. 18 (40.9%) women had evidence of shock. Seven (15.9%) women died and another seven (15.9%) were classified as WHO maternal near-miss cases. Two (4.5%) pregnancies suffered from miscarriages, four (9%) from still births and two (4.5%) from neonatal deaths. Preterm babies were delivered in 15 (34.1%) and low birth weight babies in 13 (29.5%). CONCLUSIONS: Dengue in pregnancy adversely affects maternal and fetal outcomes with high maternal mortality of 15.9%. Prematurity and postpartum haemorrhage are significant risks to mother and baby. Vector control strategies should be implemented with vigour in affected areas.","Brar, Rinnie; Sikka, Pooja; Suri, Vikas; Singh, Mini P.; Suri, Vanita; Mohindra, Ritin; Biswal, Manisha",Arch Gynecol Obstet,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7778400/,254

Annual MDA was continued in 2017 and 2018, but not in 2019, imposing a 16-month treatment gap. We monitored the Schistosoma haematobium prevalence from 2012 till 2020 and assessed recrudescence patterns with focus on 2020. METHODOLOGY: Repeated cross-sectional surveys were conducted from 2011/12 till 2020 in 90 communities and 90 schools in Zanzibar. Annually, around 4,500 adults and up to 20,000 schoolchildren were surveyed. The S. haematobium prevalence was detected by urine filtration and reagent strips. In 2020, risk factors for infection were investigated using generalized estimated equation models. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In adults, the apparent S. haematobium prevalence was 3.9% in 2011 and 0.4% in 2020. In schoolchildren, the prevalence decreased from 6.6% in 2012 to 1.2% in 2019 with vicissitudes over the years. Prominent recrudescence of infection from 2.8% in 2019 to 9.1% (+225%) in 2020 was observed in 29 schools with historically moderate prevalences (≥10%). Compared with 2019, reinfection in 2020 was particularly striking in boys aged 9–16 years. Being male was a risk factor for infection in 2020 (adults: odds ratio (OR): 6.24, 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 1.96–19.60; schoolchildren: OR: 2.06, 95% CI: 1.52–2.78). Living near to a natural freshwater body significantly increased the odds of infection in adults (OR: 2.90, CI: 1.12–7.54). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: After 11 rounds of MDA over 7 years and a 16-month treatment gap, the urogenital schistosomiasis prevalence considerably rebounded in hotspot areas. Future elimination efforts in Zanzibar should focus on re-intensifying MDA plus additional interventions in hotspot areas. In low-prevalence areas, the strategy might be adapted from MDA to targeted surveillance-response.","Trippler, Lydia; Ame, Shaali Makame; Hattendorf, Jan; Juma, Saleh; Abubakar, Salum; Ali, Said Mohammed; Kabole, Fatma; Rollinson, David; Knopp, Stefanie",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7880478/,254

High mobility group box-1 protein (HMGB1) is a critical mediator of lethal sepsis, which has prompted investigation for the development of new treatment for inflammation. Here, we report that the potent and selective inhibition of CBP bromodomain by SGC-CBP30 blocks HMGB1-mediated inflammatory responses in vitro and in vivo. Our data suggest that CBP bromodomain inhibition suppresses LPS-induced expression and release of HMGB1, when the inhibitor was given 8 h post LPS stimulation; moreover, CBP bromodomain inhibition attenuated pro-inflammatory activity of HMGB1. Furthermore, our findings provide evidence that SGC-CBP30 down-regulated rhHMGB1-induced activation of MAPKs and NF-κB signaling by triggering the reactivation of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and the stabilization of MAPK phosphatase 1 (MKP-1). Collectively, these results suggest that CBP bromodomain could serve as a candidate therapeutic target for the treatment of lethal sepsis via inhibiting LPS-induced expression and release of HMGB1 and suppressing the pro-inflammatory activity of HMGB1.","Bi, Xiaowen; Jiang, Baolin; Zhou, Jinyi; Fan, Xirui; Yan, Xintong; Liang, Juanjuan; Luo, Lan; Yin, Zhimin",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7884462/,254

Aerosolized antimicrobial therapy is becoming increasingly attractive to combat such infections, as it allows targeted delivery of high drug concentrations to the infected organ while limiting systemic exposure. However, successful aerosolized antimicrobial therapy is still challenged by the diverse biological barriers in infected lungs. Nanoparticle-mediated pulmonary drug delivery is gaining increasing attention as a means to overcome the biological barriers and accomplish site-specific drug delivery by controlling release of the loaded drug(s) at the target site. With the aim to summarize emerging efforts in combating respiratory tract infections by using nanoparticle-mediated pulmonary delivery strategies, this review provides a brief introduction to the bacterial infection-related pulmonary diseases and the biological barriers for effective treatment of recalcitrant respiratory tract infections. This is followed by a summary of recent advances in design of inhalable nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems that overcome the biological barriers and increase drug bioavailability. Finally, challenges for the translation from exploratory laboratory research to clinical application are also discussed and potential solutions proposed.

This has, however, also created rodents with little diversity in their microbiota. Until 10 years ago the impact of the microbiota on the outcome of rodent studies was ignored, but today it is clear that the phenotype of rodent models differs essentially in relation to the environment of origin, i.e. different breeders or different rooms. In this review, we outline the mechanisms behind gut bacterial impact on rodent models of immune mediated diseases, and how differences in environment of origin leads to phenotypic model differences within research areas such as infectious diseases and vaccine development, the metabolic syndrome, gut immunity and inflammation, autoimmunity and allergy. Finally, we sum up some tools to handle this impact to increase reproducibility and translatability of rodent models.","Hansen, Axel Kornerup; Hansen, Camilla Hartmann Friis",Mamm Genome,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8012743/,254

This article reports on a study that investigates the impact of teachers’ professional experience and transparency of textbook activities (due to materials design) on teachers’ actual perception of the transparency of materials. The study adopted a mixed-methods design and collected quantitative data via a five-point scale survey from 115 secondary school teachers as well as interview data from 15 informants. Data analysis reveals that both teachers’ professional experience and transparency of textbook activities affect the degree of easiness teachers perceived as they understand and interpret the activities for pedagogical purposes. However, discrepancy exists between transparency in materials design and transparency in teachers’ perception. Lack of pedagogical knowledge about the relationship between teaching objectives, steps, and assessment and strong existing cognitive schemata developed from the stereotype of processing a familar set of teaching materials might hamper teachers’ perception of transparency.","Xu, Hao",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8173172/,254

Coordinated genomic surveillance of Vibrio cholerae in the areas most affected may reveal transmission patterns important for cholera control. METHODS: During a regional sequencing workshop in Nigeria, we sequenced 46 recent V. cholerae isolates from Cameroon, Niger, and Nigeria (37 from 2018 to 2019) to better understand the relationship between the V. cholerae bacterium circulating in these three countries. RESULTS: From these isolates, we generated 44 whole Vibrio cholerae O1 sequences and analyzed them in the context of 1280 published V. cholerae O1 genomes. All sequences belonged to the T12 V. cholerae seventh pandemic lineage. CONCLUSIONS: Phylogenetic analysis of newly generated and previously published V. cholerae genomes suggested that the T12 lineage has been continuously transmitted within West Africa since it was first observed in the region in 2009, despite lack of reported cholera in the intervening years. The results from this regional sequencing effort provide a model for future regionally coordinated surveillance efforts.

19214,Distribution and determinants of hospital efficiency and relative productivity in county-level hospitals in rural China: an observational study,2021-07-02,"OBJECTIVES: Digital systems have long been used to improve the quality and safety of care when managing acute kidney injury (AKI). The availability of digitised clinical data can also turn organisations and their networks into learning healthcare systems (LHSs) if used across all levels of health and care. This review explores the impact of digital systems i.e. on patients with AKI care, to gauge progress towards establishing LHSs and to identify existing gaps in the research. METHODS: Embase, PubMed, MEDLINE, Cochrane, Scopus and Web of Science databases were searched. Studies of real-time or near real-time digital AKI management systems which reported process and outcome measures were included. RESULTS: Thematic analysis of 43 studies showed that most interventions used real-time serum creatinine levels to trigger responses to enable risk prediction, early recognition of AKI or harm prevention by individual clinicians (micro level) or specialist teams (meso level). Interventions at system (macro level) were rare. There was limited evidence of change in outcomes. DISCUSSION: While the benefits of real-time digital clinical data at micro level for AKI management have been evident for some time, their application at meso and macro levels is emergent therefore limiting progress towards establishing LHSs. Lack of progress is due to digital maturity, system design, human factors and policy levers. CONCLUSION: Future approaches need to harness the potential of interoperability, data analytical advances and include multiple stakeholder perspectives to develop effective digital LHSs in order to gain benefits across the system.","Chew, Clair Ka Tze; Hogan, Helen; Jani, Yogini",BMJ Health Care Inform,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8264899/,254
19644,Neutrophils defending the defenders,2021-05-14,"Multimorbidity, the presence of 1+ chronic condition in an individual, remains one of the greatest challenges to health on a global scale. Although the prevalence of multimorbidity has been well-established, its incidence is not fully understood. This systematic review determined the incidence of multimorbidity across the lifespan; the order in which chronic conditions accumulate to result in multimorbidity; and cataloged methods used to determine and report accumulation of chronic conditions resulting in multimorbidity. Studies were identified by searching MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and Cochrane electronic databases. Two independent reviewers evaluated studies for inclusion and performed quality assessments. Of 36 included studies, there was high heterogeneity in study design and operational definitions of multimorbidity. Studies reporting incidence (n = 32) reported a median incidence rate of 30.7 per 1,000 person-years (IQR 39.5 per 1,000 person-years) and a median cumulative incidence of 2.8% (IQR 28.7%). Incidence was notably higher for persons with older age and 1+ chronic conditions at baseline. Studies reporting patterns in accumulation of chronic conditions (n = 5) reported hypertensive and heart diseases, and diabetes, as among the common starting conditions resulting in later multimorbidity. Methods used to discern patterns were highly heterogenous, ranging from the use of latent growth trajectories to divisive cluster analyses, and presentation using alluvial plots to cluster trajectories. Studies reporting the incidence of multimorbidity and patterns in accumulation of chronic conditions vary greatly in study designs and definitions used. To allow for more accurate estimations and comparison, studies must be transparent and consistent in operational definitions of multimorbidity applied.","Kudesia, Prtha; Salimarouny, Banafsheh; Stanley, Meagan; Fortin, Martin; Stewart, Moira; Terry, Amanda; Ryan, Bridget L",J Comorb,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8287424/,254
20189,A Shift Toward Childbearing in One-Child Families Through a Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction Program: A Randomized Controlled Trial,2021-03-11,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although pain is one of the most common symptoms of diseases, it is often mismanaged due to limited access to painkillers and ineffectiveness, unacceptable side effects, or the possibility of abuse. However, an alternative approach to existing analgesics is to indirectly increase endogenous pain relief pathways by neprilysin (an enkephalinase) inhibitors. This enzyme breaks down and inactivates enkephalin, dynorphin, endorphins, and their derivatives. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: In this project, a new series of racecadotril-tetrazole-amino acid derivatives 15a-l was synthesized and characterized on the basis of IR, (1)H and (13)C NMR, mass spectrometry, and elemental analysis. The antinociceptive activity of synthesized compounds was assessed by a hot plate, tail-flick, and formalin assays in mice. Docking was used to identify the possible interactions between neprilysin and synthesized compounds. 15a-l was synthesized and characterized on the basis of IR, (1)H and (13)C NMR, mass spectrometry, and elemental analysis. The antinociceptive activity of synthesized compounds was assessed by a hot plate, tail-flick, and formalin assays in mice. Docking was used to identify the possible interactions between neprilysin and synthesized compounds. FINDINGS/RESULTS: Most of the synthesized compounds showed moderate to good analgesic effects in hot plat and tail-flick test in comparison to morphine and racecadotril. Compounds 15l and 15j were the most potent compounds. The synergistic analgesic effect of compounds 15l and 15j with morphine and the antagonistic effect of naloxone on the activity of these compounds confirm that the analgesic effect of compounds 15l and 15j could be mediated through the opioidergic system. The negative and high binding energy of docking simulation of the most potent compounds in the catalytic site of neprilysin was also in good agreement with the inhibitory activity of test compounds. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Racecadotril-tetrazole-amino acid derivatives, as potential antinociceptive agents, demonstrated moderate to good antinociceptive activities comparable with morphine and higher than racecadotril.","Asadi, Mehdi; Mohammadi-Khanaposhtani, Maryam; Hosseini, Faezeh Sadat; Gholami, Mahdi; Dehpour, Ahmad Reza; Amanlou, Massoud",Res Pharm Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8356715/,254

Patients with primary hypertension were randomly assigned (1:1) to a therapeutic strategy targeting the normalization of carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) measured every 6 months (PWV group, n=264) versus a classical therapeutic strategy only implementing the European Guidelines for Hypertension Treatment (conventional group, n=272). In the PWV group, the therapeutic strategy used preferably a combination of ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker and calcium channel blockers, as well as maximal recommended doses of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers. The primary outcome was a combined end point including particularly stroke and coronary events. Secondary outcomes included the time-course changes in brachial office blood pressure (BP), ambulatory BP, PWV, and treatments. After a median follow-up of 48.3 months, there was no significant between-group difference in primary outcome (hazard ratio, 0.74 [95% CI, 0.40–1.38], P=0.35). In the PWV group, combinations of renin-angiotensin-system blockers and calcium channel blockers were prescribed at higher dosage (P=0.028), office and ambulatory systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure decreased more (P<0.001 and P<0.01, respectively), and PWV increased less (P=0.0003) than in the conventional group. The SPARTE study lacked sufficient statistical power to demonstrate its primary outcome. However, it demonstrated that a PWV-driven treatment for hypertension enables to further reduce office and ambulatory systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure and prevent vascular aging in patients with hypertension at medium-to-very-high risk, compared with strict application of guidelines.","Laurent, Stephane; Chatellier, Gilles; Azizi, Michel; Calvet, David; Choukroun, Gabriel; Danchin, Nicolas; Delsart, Pascal; Girerd, Xavier; Gosse, Philippe; Khettab, Hakim; London, Gerard; Mourad, Jean-Jacques; Pannier, Bruno; Pereira, Helena; Stephan, Dominique; Valensi, Paul; Cunha, Pedro; Narkiewicz, Krzysztof; Bruno, Rosa-Maria; Boutouyrie, Pierre",Hypertension,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8415523/,254
21071,Developing Priorities for Palliative Care Research in Advanced Liver Disease: A Multidisciplinary Approach,2021-06-16,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) is common and is a significant contributor to atherosclerosis and pancreatitis risk. Specific HTG treatments have had variable success in reducing atherosclerosis risk. Novel therapies for severe HTG treatment and pancreatitis risk reduction are likely to be available soon. These novel therapies are expected to have broader applications for more moderate HTG and atherosclerosis risk reduction as well. RECENT FINDINGS: NHANES 2012 data has confirmed a reduction in average triglyceride (TG) levels in the US population. Dietary modification and weight reduction when needed remain the core treatment elements for all individuals with HTG, while statin therapy is a foundational pharmacologic care for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) event risk reduction. In addition, the REDUCE-IT study provides evidence for additional benefit from the use of high-dose icosapent ethyl (IPE) on top of background medical therapy in adults with moderate HTG and ASCVD or type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) and additional ASCVD risk factors. However, treatment with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) combined with docosahexanoic acid (DHA) did not reduce ASCVD in a similar population studied in the STRENGTH trial. Furthermore, novel therapeutics targeting PPAR-ɑ, as well as ApoC-III and AngPTL3, effectively lower TG levels in individuals with moderate and severe HTG, respectively. These treatments may have applicability for reducing risk from ASCVD among individuals with chylomicronemia; in addition, ApoC-III and AngPTL3 treatments may have a role in treating individuals with the rare monogenic familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS) at risk for acute pancreatitis (AP). SUMMARY: Residual ASCVD risk in individuals treated with contemporary care may be due in part to non-LDL lipid abnormalities including HTG. The findings from REDUCE-IT, but not STRENGTH, confirm that consumption of high-dose EPA may reduce ASCVD risk, while combination therapy of EPA plus DHA does not reduce ASCVD in a similar population. TG lowering likely reduces ASCVD risk in individuals with HTG, but ASCVD risk is multifactorial; the added benefit of IPE to contemporary preventive therapy is the consequence of differential non-TG biologic properties between the two fatty acids. Acute pancreatitis is more difficult to study prospectively since it is less common; however, TG lowering is likely critical for the care of at-risk individuals. Additional benefit from novel therapy that has an impact on this otherwise refractory condition is anticipated.","Hernandez, Patricia; Passi, Neena; Modarressi, Taher; Kulkarni, Vivek; Soni, Meshal; Burke, Fran; Bajaj, Archna; Soffer, Daniel",Curr Atheroscler Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8436578/,254

In Italy the epidemic event provoked sometimes excessive and irrational psychological reactions (from an unjustified panic to an irresponsible underestimation) and a cognitive distortion on anthropological level (wrong perspective perception of the pathological event).

This study was undertaken to assess whether in vitro incubation of camel blood at 41°C, simulating conditions of heat stress, differently alters cell vitality, phenotype, and function of leukocytes, compared to incubation at 37°C (normothermia). Using flow cytometry, the cell vitality (necrosis and apoptosis), the expression of several cell markers and adhesion molecules, and the antimicrobial functions of camel leukocytes were analyzed in vitro. The fraction of apoptotic cells within the granulocytes, lymphocytes, and monocytes increased significantly after incubation of camel whole blood at 41°C for 4 h. The higher increase in apoptotic granulocytes and monocytes compared to lymphocytes suggests higher resistance of camel lymphocytes to heat stress. Functionally, incubation of camel blood at 41°C for 4 h enhanced the phagocytosis and ROS production activities of camel neutrophils and monocytes toward S. aureus. Monocytes from camel blood incubated at 41°C for 4 h significantly decreased their expression level of MHC class II molecules with no change in the abundance of CD163, resulting in a CD163(high) MHC-II(low) M2-like macrophage phenotype. In addition, heat stress treatment showed an inhibitory effect on the LPS-induced changes in camel monocytes phenotype. Furthermore, in vitro incubation of camel blood at 41°C reduced the expression of the cell adhesion molecules CD18 and CD11a on neutrophils and monocytes. Collectively, the present study identified some heat-stress-induced phenotypic and functional alterations in camel blood leukocytes, providing a paradigm for comparative immunology in the large animals. The clinical relevance of the observed changes in camel leukocytes for the adaptation of the camel immune response to heat stress conditions needs further in vitro and in vivo studies.","Hussen, Jamal",Front Vet Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8062783/,254

To understand students’ meaningful online English learning, this study surveyed 529 Chinese university students on their perceptions of authentic language learning (AULL), self-directed learning (SDL), collaborative learning (CL), and their English self-efficacy (ESE) during the online learning period of the COVID-19 pandemic. The validation findings indicated that the survey possessed satisfactory validity and internal consistency. Survey results revealed Chinese university students’ meaningful language learning with technology in an online English course during the COVID-19 pandemic. Structural equation modelling (SEM) unveiled the interconnected relationships among AULL, SDL, CL, and students’ ESE. More importantly, the mediating effects of SDL and CL offered a deeper understanding of language learners’ meaningful online learning process. Results can inform educators about the importance of structuring authentic language learning with SDL and CL for both online and face-to-face learning beyond the pandemic.

52363,Glycaemic Control in Children and Adolescents With Type 1 Diabetes Following a Single Telehealth Visit:What Have We Learned From the COVID-19 Lockdown?,2021-05-03,"BACKGROUND: Haematuria often requires investigation with an imaging test and flexible cystoscopy to rule out urinary tract cancers. With a reduction in diagnostic services due to the COVID-19 pandemic there is a risk of compromise in the care of patients referred with haematuria. We aimed to provide a pragmatic strategy that optimises the use of scarce resources by reducing patient visits to hospital and allocating the appropriate diagnostic tests according to risk of bladder cancer. METHODS: The IDENTIFY study was an international, prospective, multicentre cohort study of over 11,000 patients referred to secondary care for investigation of newly suspected urinary tract cancer. Patients underwent cystoscopy, imaging tests, urine cytology and transurethral resection of bladder tumour (TURBT), where indicated. We developed strategies using combinations of imaging and cytology as triage tests to flexible cystoscopy. These strategies aimed to maximise cancer detection within a pragmatic pathway in a resource-limited environment. FINDINGS: 8112 patients (74·4%) received an ultrasound or a CT urogram, with or without cytology. 5737 (70·7%) patients had visible haematuria (VH) and 2375 (29·3%) had non-visible haematuria (NVH). Amongst all patients, 1474 (18·2%) had bladder cancer; 1333 (23·2%) in VH group and 141 (5·94%) in NVH group. Diagnostic test performance was used to determine optimal age cut-offs for each proposed strategy. We recommended proceeding directly to TURBT for patients of any age with positive triage tests for cancer. Patients with negative triage tests under 35-years-old with VH, or under 50-years-old with NVH can safely be discharged without undergoing flexible cystoscopy. The remaining patients may undergo flexible cystoscopy, with a greater priority for older patients (threshold of 60-years-old with VH, or 70-years-old with NVH) to capture high risk bladder cancer. INTERPRETATION: We suggest diagnostic strategies in patients with haematuria, which focus on detection of bladder cancer, whilst reducing the burden to healthcare services in a resource-limited setting.","Khadhouri, Sinan; Gallagher, Kevin; MacKenzie, Kenneth; Shah, Taimur; Gao, Chuanyu; Moore, Sacha; Zimmermann, Eleanor; Edison, Eric; Jefferies, Matthew; Nambiar, Arjun; Mannas, Miles; Lee, Taeweon; Marra, Giancarlo; Rivaz, Juan Gomez; Marcq, Gautier; Assmuss, Mark; Ucar, Taha; Claps, Francesco; Boltri, Mattes; Montagna, Giuseppe La; Burnhope, Tara; Nkwam, Nkwam; Austin, Tomas; Boxall, Nicholas; Downey, Alison; Sukhu, Troy; Anton0Juanilla, Marta; Rai, Sonpreet; Chin, Yew0Fung; Moore, Madeline; Drake, Tamsin; Green, James; Nielsen, Matthew; Takwoingi, Yemisi; McGrath, John; Kasivisvanathan, Veeru; Khadhouri, Sinan",BJS Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8083464/,254

56913,Prevalence of Enteric Fever Pathogens Isolated from Blood Culture at a Tertiary Care Centre,2021-03-31,"Home hemodialysis (HHD) is the cornerstone of renal replacement therapy in Germany. From 1969, it enabled survival with a diagnosis that up to then had been fatal; however, with the development of a good network of dialysis centers, the knowledge and experience of HHD was increasingly lost. Today, HHD is practically no longer included in the education. Insufficient information and a lack of HHD services are the result. Currently, less than 0.8% of patients in Germany are treated with HHD. In the development of dialysis machines, the industry focused on stand-alone machines for the centers. This form of treatment hinders mobility and limits the activities of patients with renal insufficiency requiring dialysis. Starting with the Advancing American Kidney Health Initiative there has been a welcome momentum in the development of innovative, wearable and implantable artificial kidneys. This can improve the quality of life and reduce the mortality rate. The first initiatives have also emerged in Germany and Europe. These innovative devices and the associated transition in renal replacement therapy will solve many problems of the nephrology community, such as personnel shortages or the lack of donor organs and death on the waiting list and give patients independence and mobility. The cost burden on healthcare systems can be reduced. In addition, the immense water and electricity consumption will be dramatically reduced by the regenerative techniques of the new machines.","Kitsche, Benno; Bach, Dieter",Nephrologe,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8361820/,254

The present study is a cross-sectional, school-based study conducted to assess the prevalence of obesity and to determine the demographic variables influencing the obesity among school children. METHODS: The study included 440 students (Boys: 240, Girls: 200) from two randomly selected schools of Mysuru city, Karnataka. WHO Standard Age and Sex specific Growth Reference charts were used for defining overweight and obesity. Modified Kuppuswamy's socioeconomic scale (2019) was adopted to assess the socioeconomic status of the family. RESULTS: Obesity prevalence among the study subjects was 3.86% and overweight was 12.27%. The mean body mass index (BMI) among boys was 18.13 and girls was 18.80. The difference in the distribution of BMI between male and female groups was statistically significant (P = 0.023). Age and obesity status of the children was found to have a significant association (P = 0.022). Prevalence of overweight and obesity was more among children from higher socioeconomic class (P = 0.01). CONCLUSION: Prevalence of obesity and overweight among school children is comparatively higher. The higher familial income, dietary patterns, parental history of obesity and diabetes and having urban residence were identified as the major factors which influenced the obesity status of the school children.","Thomas, Usha M; Narayanappa, D; Sujatha, MS",J Family Med Prim Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8483084/,254

61552,"Supporting People With Diabetes, Through COVID-19 and Beyond.",2020-05-21,"PROBLEM The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged health care systems in an unprecedented way by imposing new demands on health care resources and scientific knowledge. There has also been an exceedingly fast accumulation of new information on this novel virus. As the traditional peer-review process takes time, there is currently a significant gap between the ability to generate new data and the ability to critically evaluate it. This problem of an excess of mixed-quality data, or infodemic, is echoing throughout the scientific community. APPROACH The authors aimed to help their colleagues at the Rambam Medical Center, Haifa, Israel, manage the COVID-19 infodemic with a methodologic solution: establishing an in-house mechanism for continuous literature review and knowledge distribution (March-April 2020). Their methodology included the following building blocks: a dedicated literature review team, artificial intelligence-based research algorithms, brief written updates in a graphical format, large-scale webinars and online meetings, and a feedback loop. OUTCOMES During the first month (April 2020), the project produced 21 graphical updates. After consideration of feedback from colleagues and final editing, 13 graphical updates were uploaded to the center's website; of these, 31% addressed the clinical presentation of the disease and 38% referred to specific treatments. This methodology as well as the graphical updates it generated were adopted by the Israeli Ministry of Health and distributed in a hospital preparation kit. NEXT STEPS The authors believe they have established a novel methodology that can assist in the battle against COVID-19 by making high-quality scientific data more accessible to clinicians. In the future, they expect this methodology to create a favorable uniform standard for evidence-guided health care during infodemics. Further evolution of the methodology may include evaluation of its long-term sustainability and impact on the day-to-day clinical practice and self-confidence of clinicians who treat COVID-19 patients.","Gruber, Amit; Ghiringhelli, Matteo; Edri, Oded; Abboud, Yousef; Shiti, Assad; Shaheen, Naim; Ballan, Nimer; Neuberger, Ami; Caspi, Oren",Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,https://doi.org/10.1097/acm.0000000000004073; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33788792/,254

The computational storage, data manipulation, and bioinformatic interpretation of thousands to millions of variants identified in ES and GS, respectively, is a challenging task. To aid in that endeavor, we constructed PhenoDB, GeneMatcher and VariantMatcher. RESULTS PhenoDB is an accessible, freely available, web-based platform that allows users to store, share, analyze and interpret their patients' phenotypes and variants from ES/GS data. GeneMatcher is accessible to all stakeholders as a web-based tool developed to connect individuals (researchers, clinicians, health care providers and patients) around the globe with interest in the same gene(s), variant(s) or phenotype(s). Finally, VariantMatcher was developed to enable public sharing of variant-level data and phenotypic information from individuals sequenced as part of multiple disease gene discovery projects. Here we provide updates on PhenoDB and GeneMatcher applications and implementation and introduce VariantMatcher. CONCLUSION Each of these tools has facilitated worldwide data sharing and data analysis and improved our ability to connect genes to phenotypic traits.

We investigated associations of epilepsy and survival in three cohorts of brain tumor patients (meningioma, glioblastoma, brain metastases). Cohorts were segregated into three groups for comparative analyses: (i) no epilepsy, (ii) epilepsy without status epilepticus and (iii) status epilepticus. Status epilepticus was considered a surrogate of extensive neuronal hyperexcitability. Main outcome was progression-free survival (meningioma) and overall survival (glioblastoma and brain metastases), adjusted for established prognostic factors and onset of epilepsy by time-dependent multivariate Cox modeling. The primary analysis population comprised 1792 patients (742 meningioma, 249 glioblastoma, 801 brain metastases). Epilepsy was associated with favorable prognostic factors. On multivariate analyses, status epilepticus was however associated with inferior overall survival of patients with glioblastoma (status epilepticus vs no epilepsy multivariate HR 3.72, CI 1.78-7.76, P<0.001) and brain metastases (status epilepticus vs no epilepsy HR 2.30, CI 1.10-4.79, P=0.026). Among brain metastases patients, but not among patients with meningioma or glioblastoma, epilepsy was similarly associated with inferior overall survival (epilepsy vs no epilepsy HR 2.16, CI 1.60-2.93, P<0.001).

65036,Factors associated with resolution of type-2 diabetes mellitus after sleeve gastrectomy in obese adults.,2021-03-16,"BACKGROUND Questions have emerged as to whether single-incision laparoscopy has reproducible or superior patient outcomes compared with traditional laparoscopy. A retrospective review comparing single-incision laparoscopic (SILS) appendectomy and traditional multiport laparoscopic (MP) appendectomy was conducted to assess the safety and feasibility of the less invasive laparoscopic technique. METHODS All SILS and MP appendectomies performed by three surgeons at a single institution during 43 months were reviewed. Statistical evaluation included descriptive analysis of demographic data including age and gender, as well as bi- and multi-variate analyses of operative outcomes including operative time, conversions, complications, and hospital length of stay. RESULTS The study reviewed 168 patients who underwent SILS appendectomy and 108 patients who underwent MP appendectomy. No statistically significant difference was found between the mean SILS and MP operative times (43.63 vs. 40.95 min; p = 0.29). Additionally, no statistically significant association was noted between surgical approach and length of hospital stay. Although 0.93 % of MP appendectomies and 2.38 % of SILS appendectomies were converted to open procedure, this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.65, Fisher's exact test). After exclusion of cases converted to open procedure from the study, the findings showed that 3.66 % of SILS cases were converted to multiport laparoscopy. No increase in the overall complication rate was associated with SILS compared with MP appendectomy. The wound complications documented included one incisional hernia for SILS appendectomy and two wound infections for MP appendectomy. CONCLUSION The findings showed SILS appendectomy to be a safe and feasible alternative to traditional MP appendectomy that can be conducted with operative times, lengths of stay, and complication rates similar to those of the standardized technique. This review is a precursor to prospective studies, which are warranted to demonstrate conclusively the equivalence of operative times, complications, and lengths of hospital stay, as well as to elucidate differences in patient-centered outcomes including postoperative pain, cosmesis, and quality of life.","Buckley, F Paul; Vassaur, Hannah; Monsivais, Sharon; Jupiter, Daniel; Watson, Rob; Eckford, John",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-013-3219-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24091553/,254
66004,Crisis clinical pathway for COVID-19.,2020-09-10,"Objectives: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in rapid reorganisations of hospital care. In our hospital, the geriatrics team introduced the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) on the non-ICU COVID-19 units during these reorganisations. A retrospective analysis was performed to investigate the CFS as a risk factor for severe COVID-19 disease and in-hospital death in older patients with COVID-19. Methods: In patients aged ≥70 years, an online geriatric assessment questionnaire was launched, from which the CFS was scored by the geriatrics team. Additional clinical data were collected from the electronic medical records. Risk factors related to ageing, such as the CFS, age-adjusted Charlson Comorbidity Index, living situation and cognitive decline, were examined alongside frequently reported risk factors in the general population. Outcomes were in-hospital death (primary outcome) and oxygen need of ≥6 litres and early warning score ≥7, as parameters for severe disease (secondary outcomes). Baseline characteristics were described with descriptive statistics. Associations were analysed with uni- and multivariable analyses. Results: One hundred and five patients were included, median age 82 years. CFS scores were 1-4 in 43, 5-6 in 45, and 7-9 in 17 patients. In multivariable analysis, CFS and cognitive decline were the only risk factors that were independently associated with in-hospital mortality. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, presence of respiratory symptoms on admission and male gender showed and independent association with severe disease. Conclusion: A retrospective analysis shows that CFS and cognitive decline have added value for predicting in-hospital mortality in older patients with COVID-19 disease.","Fagard, Katleen; Gielen, Evelien; Deschodt, Mieke; Devriendt, Els; Flamaing, Johan",Acta clinica Belgica,https://doi.org/10.1080/17843286.2021.1890452; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33616021/,254

67421,Medical Emergencies During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2020-08-17,"This paper reports deposition of Candida antarctica Lipase B (CALB) on relatively thick poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) films (300-500 nm) to create well-defined patterns using two different writing techniques: high-affinity microcontact (HA-μCL) and polymer pen (PPL) lithography. For both, an aqueous CALB ink is absorbed onto a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) writing implement (PDMS stamp or a PDMS pen tip), which is transferred to a spun-cast PCL film. HA-μCL experiments demonstrated the importance of applied pressure to obtain high-resolution patterns since uniform contact is needed between raised 20 μm parallel line regions of the PDMS stamp and the surface. AFM imaging shows pattern formation evolves gradually over incubation time only in areas stamped with CALB cutting through spherulites without apparent influence by grain boundaries. Strong binding of CALB to PCL is postulated as the mechanism by which lateral diffusion is limited. PPL enables formation of an arbitrary image by appropriate programming of the robot. The PDMS pen tips were coated with an aqueous CALB solution and then brought into contact with the PCL film to transfer CALB onto the surface. By repeating the ink transfer step multiple times where pen tips are brought into contact with the PCL film at a different locations, a pattern of dots is formed. After printing, patterns were developed at 37 °C and 95% RH. Over a 7-day period, CALB progressively etched the PCL down to the silicon wafer on which it was spun (350 nm) giving round holes with diameters about 10 μm. AFM images show the formation of steep PCL walls indicating CALB degraded the PCL film in areas to which it was applied. This work demonstrates that high-resolution patterns can be achieved without immobilizing the enzyme on the surface of polymeric stamps that limits the depth of features obtained as well as the throughput of the process.","Ganesh, Manoj; Nachman, Jonathan; Mao, Zhantong; Lyons, Alan; Rafailovich, Miriam; Gross, Richard",Biomacromolecules,https://doi.org/10.1021/bm400552u; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23808571/,254

However, the resulting PSD plot lacks temporal information, making interpretation sometimes equivocal. For example, consider two different PSDs: a central parietal EEG PSD with twin peaks at 10 Hz and 20 Hz and a central parietal PSD with twin peaks at 10 Hz and 50 Hz. We can assume the first PSD shows a mu rhythm and the second harmonic; however, the latter PSD likely shows an alpha peak and an independent line noise. Without prior knowledge, however, the PSD alone cannot distinguish between the two cases. To address this limitation of PSD, we propose using cross-frequency power-power coupling (PPC) as a post-processing of independent component (IC) analysis (ICA) to distinguish brain components from muscle and environmental artifact sources. We conclude that post-ICA PPC analysis could serve as a new data-driven EEG classifier in M/EEG studies. For the reader's convenience, we offer a brief literature overview on the disparate use of PPC. The proposed cross-frequency power-power coupling analysis toolbox (PowPowCAT) is a free, open-source toolbox, which works as an EEGLAB extension.","Thammasan, Nattapong; Miyakoshi, Makoto",Sensors,https://doi.org/10.3390/s20247040; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33316928/,254

The aim of this study was to 3D bioprint implants containing spatiotemporally defined patterns of growth factors optimized for coupled angiogenesis and osteogenesis. Using nanoparticle functionalized bioinks, it was possible to print implants with distinct growth factor patterns and release profiles spanning from days to weeks. The extent of angiogenesis in vivo depended on the spatial presentation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Higher levels of vessel invasion were observed in implants containing a spatial gradient of VEGF compared to those homogenously loaded with the same total amount of protein. Printed implants containing a gradient of VEGF, coupled with spatially defined BMP-2 localization and release kinetics, accelerated large bone defect healing with little heterotopic bone formation. This demonstrates the potential of growth factor printing, a putative point of care therapy, for tightly controlled tissue regeneration.","Freeman, Fiona E; Pitacco, Pierluca; van Dommelen, Lieke H A; Nulty, Jessica; Browe, David C; Shin, Jung-Youn; Alsberg, Eben; Kelly, Daniel J",Science advances,https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abb5093; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32851179/,254

73219,The Women's Leadership Gap in Diabetes: A Call for Equity and Excellence.,2021-06-15,"BACKGROUND Mitotane is the only approved treatment for patients with adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC). A better explanation for the variability in the pharmacokinetics (PK) of mitotane, and the optimization and individualization of mitotane treatment, is desirable for patients. OBJECTIVES This study aims to develop a population PK (PopPK) model to characterize and predict the PK profiles of mitotane in patients with ACC, as well as to explore the effect of genetic variation on mitotane clearance. Ultimately, we aimed to facilitate mitotane dose optimization and individualization for patients with ACC. METHODS Mitotane concentration and dosing data were collected retrospectively from the medical records of patients with ACC taking mitotane orally and participating in the Dutch Adrenal Network. PopPK modelling analysis was performed using NONMEM (version 7.4.1). Genotypes of drug enzymes and transporters, patient demographic information, and clinical characteristics were investigated as covariates. Subsequently, simulations were performed for optimizing treatment regimens. RESULTS A two-compartment model with first-order absorption and elimination best described the PK data of mitotane collected from 48 patients. Lean body weight (LBW) and genotypes of CYP2C19*2 (rs4244285), SLCO1B3 699A>G (rs7311358) and SLCO1B1 571T>C (rs4149057) were found to significantly affect mitotane clearance (CL/F), which decreased the coefficient of variation (CV%) of the random inter-individual variability of CL/F from 67.0 to 43.0%. Fat amount (i.e. body weight - LBW) was found to significantly affect the central distribution volume. Simulation results indicated that determining the starting dose using the developed model is beneficial in terms of shortening the period to reach the therapeutic target and limit the risk of toxicity. A regimen that can effectively maintain mitotane concentration within 14-20 mg/L was established. CONCLUSIONS A two-compartment PopPK model well-characterized mitotane PK profiles in patients with ACC. The CYP2C19 enzyme and SLCO1B1 and SLCO1B3 transporters may play roles in mitotane disposition. The developed model is beneficial in terms of optimizing mitotane treatment schedules and individualizing the initial dose for patients with ACC. Further validation of these findings is still required.","Yin, Anyue; Ettaieb, Madeleine H T; Swen, Jesse J; van Deun, Liselotte; Kerkhofs, Thomas M A; van der Straaten, Robert J H M; Corssmit, Eleonora P M; Gelderblom, Hans; Kerstens, Michiel N; Feelders, Richard A; Eekhoff, Marelise; Timmers, Henri J L M; D'Avolio, Antonio; Cusato, Jessica; Guchelaar, Henk-Jan; Haak, Harm R; Moes, Dirk Jan A R",Clinical pharmacokinetics,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40262-020-00913-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32607875/,254
73573,International travel-related control measures to contain the COVID-19 pandemic: a rapid review.,2021-03-25,"UNLABELLED Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have revolutionized the treatment of metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Although TKIs have demonstrated good clinical efficacy, the lack of complete responses, the chronic nature of the treatment, and the side effects are clear disadvantages. An interesting new approach in the treatment of clear cell RCC is antibody-mediated therapy with the chimeric anti-carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) antibody girentuximab (cG250). As the results of several girentuximab trials become available, the question arises of whether TKI treatment can be combined with girentuximab-based therapy. In this study, we assessed the effect of the widely used TKI sorafenib on the tumor-targeting potential of (111)In-labeled girentuximab. METHODS (111)In-girentuximab imaging was performed on 15 patients suspected of having a renal malignancy, with surgery being part of their treatment plan. Of these, 10 patients were treated in a neoadjuvant setting with sorafenib (400 mg orally twice daily). Five patients received treatment during 1 wk, and 5 patients received treatment during 4 wk. In both sorafenib-treated groups, baseline and posttreatment tumor targeting of (111)In-girentuximab were compared. Surgery was performed 3 d after the last image acquisition. Five additional patients were included as a control group and had only a single (111)In-girentuximab injection and scintigraphy without any treatment. Distribution of (111)In-girentuximab was determined scintigraphically ex vivo in a 1-cm lamella of the resected tumorous kidney. Expression of CAIX and of the vascular marker CD31 was determined immunohistochemically on specimens of both tumor and normal kidney tissue. RESULTS Treatment with sorafenib resulted in a marked decrease of (111)In-girentuximab uptake in the tumor in clear cell RCC patients, especially in the group treated for 4 wk (mean change in both sorafenib-treated groups, -38.4%; range, +9.1% to -79.4%). Immunohistochemical analysis showed markedly reduced CD31 expression and vessel density in the sorafenib-treated groups but no differences in CAIX expression between the sorafenib-treated groups and the nontreated patients. CONCLUSION Treatment with sorafenib resulted in a treatment duration-dependent significantly decreased uptake of (111)In-girentumab in clear cell RCC lesions. These results indicate that the efficacy of antibody-mediated treatment or diagnosis modalities is hampered by TKI treatment.","Muselaers, Constantijn H J; Stillebroer, Alexander B; Desar, Ingrid M E; Boers-Sonderen, Marye J; van Herpen, Carla M L; de Weijert, Mirjam C A; Langenhuijsen, Johan F; Oosterwijk, Egbert; Leenders, William P J; Boerman, Otto C; Mulders, Peter F A; Oyen, Wim J G","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",https://doi.org/10.2967/jnumed.113.131110; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24396030/,254

However, little is known about the durability of the antibody response during COVID-19 convalescent phase. We investigated the prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies including IgG and IgM antibodies and the dynamic changes in antibody levels in convalescent COVID-19 patients. A total of 159 blood samples were collected from 52 recovered COVID-19 patients up to six months after symptom onset for longitudinal serological tests. The positive rate of IgG and IgM antibodies was 92.3% and 90.4% in the first month after symptom onset, and the seropositivity of IgG antibody remained high at all follow-up time points, whereas the seropositivity of IgM antibody decreased to 22.73% by the sixth months after symptom onset. The level of IgG antibody was stable, the level of IgM antibody decreased slightly in the early convalescent phase and was detected in only five patients in the sixth month after symptom onset. The level of IgG antibody was higher in the severe and critical group than in the moderate group. The anti-SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies have a long-term persistence in convalescent COVID-19 patients, whether they have long-term protection need to be further investigated.

75100,"Managing Diabetes in Pregnancy before, during and after COVID-19.",2020-05-12,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES To identify and describe reasons women do not seek health care for dysmenorrhea symptoms. BACKGROUND Although dysmenorrhea is highly prevalent among women, can cause significant disruptions in their daily lives, and may increase their risk for future chronic pain conditions, few women seek health care for dysmenorrhea. A better understanding of why women do not seek health care is necessary to develop strategies that facilitate care seeking and optimal symptom management. DESIGN A qualitative descriptive design was used to guide the study and summarise text responses to an open-ended survey question. METHODS Participants in an online survey study who had not sought health care for dysmenorrhea (N = 509) were asked to write about their reasons for not seeking care. Data were collected in January and February 2015. Participants' text responses were analysed using qualitative content analysis. RESULTS Nine categories of reasons were identified as follows: assuming symptoms are normal, preferring to self-manage symptoms, having limited resources, thinking providers would not offer help, being unaware of treatment options, considering symptoms to be tolerable, being wary of available treatments, feeling embarrassed or afraid to seek care and not seeking health care generally. CONCLUSIONS Findings can guide the development of strategies to promote care seeking and inform policy and clinical practice to improve dysmenorrhea management. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE Findings underscore the need to provide routine screening for dysmenorrhea, avoid dismissing dysmenorrhea symptoms, initiate discussions and provide education about dysmenorrhea, provide treatments options based on evidence and women's preferences and raise public awareness of dysmenorrhea and its impact.","Chen, Chen X; Shieh, Carol; Draucker, Claire B; Carpenter, Janet S",Journal of clinical nursing,https://doi.org/10.1111/jocn.13946; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28681499/,254

As a result of the pretreatment, the glucan content in the pretreated biomass was increased, whereas the contents of hemicellulose and lignin were significantly decreased. The biomass pretreatment efficiency of the DESs had improved with increasing the polarity and hydrogen bond acidity (α) of the DESs. Among the studied DESs, ChCl:lactic acid:formic acid (1:1:1) with the highest α value was the most efficient DES in extracting lignin from biomass. The pretreated biomass also showed an enhanced enzymatic saccharification yield owing to the decreased particle size of the biomass and reduced content of hemicellulose and lignin. During the pretreatment process of biomass using DESs, the extracted lignin could be recovered successfully, with a yield of up to 60% and purity of over 90%. The molecular weight of the extracted lignin was much lower than that of the native cellulolytic enzyme lignin. The DES used for pretreatment process could be also successfully reused with high recovery yield of DES and high retention of delignification capacity.","Oh, Yujin; Park, Saerom; Jung, Dahun; Oh, Kyeong Keun; Lee, Sang Hyun",International journal of biological macromolecules,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.09.145; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32991892/,254

Therefore, this study aimed to investigate Galectin-1 (Gal-1), Galectin-3 (Gal-3), and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) levels in patients with COVID-19. Gal-1, Gal-3, and PGE2 serum concentrations were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent analysis (ELISA) on 84 COVID-19 patients (severe=29 and nonsevere=55) and 56 healthy controls. In this study, the increased levels of Gal-1 (median, 9.86, 6.35, 3.67 ng/ml), Gal-3 (median, 415.31, 326.33, 243.13 pg/ml)and PGE2 (median, 193.17, 192.58, 124.62 pg/ml) levels were found in patients with COVID-19 than healthy controls (p<0.001 for all). In the severe group, Gal-3 levels were higher while there were no differences in Gal-1 and PGE2 levels (p=0.011, p=0.263, p=0.921, respectively). There was a positive correlation between serum Gal-1 and Gal-3 levels (ρ=0.871, p<0.001).

75956,Cognitive and Neuroimaging Correlates of the Insomnia Severity Index in Obstructive Sleep Apnea: A Pilot-Study.,2021-06-02,"The altitudinal distribution of biodiversity in alpine ecosystems has captured academic attention, especially in streams because of their sensitivity to climate change. In the past years, research mainly focused on understanding the role played by alpine streams' internal factors such as aquatic environmental variables, as well as physical and hydrological conditions, on the shaping of benthic macroinvertebrate communities. More recently, external factors such as terrestrial environments were included in analyses worldwide. In particular, the inherent properties constituting the ecological niche of specific species were considered as factors regulating dispersal and influencing community construction. The objective of this study was to reveal the distribution pattern and the driving factors regulating aquatic biodiversity in alpine streams. We hypothesized that the altitudinal distribution of aquatic macroinvertebrates could be explained by the interaction of the aquatic environment with both species' ecological niche and the terrestrial environment surrounding their habitat, and that rare species display a more pronounced pattern than widespread dominant species. To test these hypotheses, samples were collected from two alpine streams situated on opposite slopes of Biluo Snow Mountain in Yunnan Province, China. Results of statistical analyses showed poor explanatory power from aquatic environmental factors, while the differences in vegetation type and the ecological niche of the species played an important role in determining the distribution pattern of aquatic biodiversity. Furthermore, we found that the altitudinal distribution pattern of aquatic biodiversity exhibits a bimodal type, with rare species fitting the bimodal peaks. These findings call for a better inclusion and further investigation on the effects of the terrestrial environment on aquatic ecosystems.","Liu, Shuoran; Li, Xianfu; Tan, Lu; Fornacca, Davide; Fang, Yihao; Zhu, Lin; Rao, Caihong; Cao, Yindi; Huang, Jimin; Ren, Guopeng; Cai, Qinghua; Xiao, Wen",The Science of the total environment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.149404; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34399334/,254

We sought to determine whether adverse outcomes after carotid endarterectomy (CEA) or carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS) were similar using propensity score-matched analysis of retrospective data from a large hospital discharge database. METHODS All CEA and CAS cases were identified from the 2006 to 2011 Premier Perspective Database and subjected to 1:1 propensity score matching using 33 clinical covariates associated with carotid revascularization. A primary composite end point of peri- or postoperative mortality, stroke, or acute myocardial infarction and a modified composite end point excluding acute myocardial infarction were used to compare our findings with recent prospective controlled trials. Multivariate regression and Cox-proportional hazard ratio survival analysis were performed to compare revascularization therapy outcomes. RESULTS After 1:1 propensity score matching, 24 004 (12 002 CEA and CAS) asymptomatic and 3506 (1753 CEA and CAS) symptomatic procedures were included. The risk of the primary composite end point was significantly higher after CAS than CEA in both asymptomatic (odds ratio, 1.40 [1.19-1.65]; P<0.0001) and symptomatic (odds ratio=2.31 [1.78-3.00]; P<0.0001) presentations, irrespective of age (P=0.28) or sex (P=0.35). Similar findings were observed using the modified composite end point for both asymptomatic (odds ratio, 1.49 [1.25-1.78]; P<0.0001) and symptomatic (odds ratio, 3.02 [2.25-4.07]; P<0.0001) presentations. Acute myocardial infarction risk was not significantly different between revascularization therapies, regardless of clinical presentation (P=0.71 and 0.24). CONCLUSIONS Among individuals undergoing carotid artery revascularization from a large sample of US hospitals, CAS was associated with higher risk of perioperative mortality, stroke, and unfavorable discharges compared with CEA for all ages and clinical presentations.","McDonald, Robert J; McDonald, Jennifer S; Therneau, Terry M; Lanzino, Giuseppe; Kallmes, David F; Cloft, Harry J",Stroke,https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.114.006323; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25300973/,254

77772,Built environments for inpatient stroke rehabilitation services and care: a systematic literature review.,2021-08-05,"Suicidal behavior and mood disorders are one of the world's largest public health problems. The biological vulnerability for these problems includes genetic factors involved in the regulation of the serotonergic system and stress system. The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is a neuroendocrine system that regulates the body's response to stress and has complex interactions with brain serotonergic, noradrenergic and dopaminergic systems. Corticotropin-releasing hormone and vasopressin act synergistically to stimulate the secretion of ACTH that stimulates the biosynthesis of corticosteroids such as cortisol from cholesterol. Cortisol is a major stress hormone and has effects on many tissues, including on mineralocorticoid receptors and glucocorticoid receptors in the brain. Glucocorticoids produce behavioral changes, and one important target of glucocorticoids is the hypothalamus, which is a major controlling center of the HPA axis. Stress plays a major role in the various pathophysiological processes associated with mood disorders and suicidal behavior. Serotonergic dysfunction is a well-established substrate for mood disorders and suicidal behavior. Corticosteroids may play an important role in the relationship between stress, mood changes and perhaps suicidal behavior by interacting with 5-HT1A receptors. Abnormalities in the HPA axis in response to increased levels of stress are found to be associated with a dysregulation in the serotonergic system, both in subjects with mood disorders and those who engage in suicidal behavior. HPA over-activity may be a good predictor of mood disorders and perhaps suicidal behavior via abnormalities in the serotonergic system.","Pompili, Maurizio; Serafini, Gianluca; Innamorati, Marco; Möller-Leimkühler, Anne Maria; Giupponi, Giancarlo; Girardi, Paolo; Tatarelli, Roberto; Lester, David",European archives of psychiatry and clinical neuroscience,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00406-010-0108-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20174927/,254

BACKGROUND LAA exclusion has been used to prevent thrombus formation within the LAA in AF patients and is believed to decrease the risk of cardioembolic events. METHODS LAA ligation with the Lariat device was performed in 139 patients with nonvalvular AF. LAA closure was verified during the procedure by LA angiography and transesophageal echocardiography. A follow-up transesophageal echocardiography was performed at 30 to 45 days post-procedure. After the procedure, patients received aspirin only, clopidogrel only, aspirin plus clopidogrel, or no antithrombotic drugs. Patients did not receive transition oral anticoagulation therapy post-LAA ligation. Patients were followed for LAA closure and adverse events, including stroke, systemic events, and death. RESULTS Acute closure was accomplished in 138 of 139 treated patients (99%). In 1 patient, a posterior lobe was partially closed. At the day-30 to day-45 transesophageal echocardiography (n = 127), 114 (90%) had complete LAA closure, and 13 (10%) had a 2- to 4-mm leak. There were no leaks ≥5 mm. The periprocedural adverse event rate was 11.5%, including 2 cardiac perforations and 1 death due to pulmonary embolus. Over a mean follow-up of 2.9 ± 1.1 years, the event rate for the composite endpoint of stroke and systemic embolism was 1.0% per year (n = 4). The combined stroke, embolism, and death of any cause event rate was 2.8% (n = 11) per year. CONCLUSIONS The findings from this analysis of post-procedure event rates suggest that LAA ligation with the Lariat device effectively closes the LAA and may be a beneficial approach to reduce the risk of embolic events in AF patients ineligible to oral anticoagulation therapy. However, future randomized clinical trials are needed to verify these results and to determine device and procedural safety.","Sievert, Horst; Rasekh, Abdi; Bartus, Kryzstof; Morelli, Remo L; Fang, Qizhi; Kuropka, Jonas; Le, Duong; Gafoor, Sameer; Heuer, Luisa; Safavi-Naeini, Payam; Hue, Trisha F; Marcus, Gregory M; Badhwar, Nitish; Massumi, Ali; Lee, Randall J",JACC.

78704,"Active living environments, physical activity and premature cardiometabolic mortality in Canada: a nationwide cohort study.",2020-11-20,"OBJECTIVE A series of evidence showed that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play an essential regulatory role in the occurrence and development of human cancer, and is a potential biological target in the fight against cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS In this research, we investigated the role of lncRNA MGC27345 in gastric cancer (GC), the expression of MGC27345 in GC was detected by quantitative Real-Time PCR in GC tissue from 235 patients. The correlations between MGC27345 expression and clinicopathological variables and survival were evaluated by the Chi-square test. Kaplan-Meier method (log-rank test), univariate and multivariate Cox regression assays were carried out for the identification of the survival and independent risk factors for GC. RESULTS MGC27345 expression levels were significantly decreased in GC tissues than in adjacent normal specimens. Lower expression of MGC27345 was found in advanced tumor stages. GC patients with low-expression of MGC27345 had a poorer overall survival compare to those with high-expression of MGC27345. Furthermore, MGC27345 was an independent protective prognosis factor in GC development. CONCLUSIONS Our data indicated that MGC27345 may have a diagnostic and prognostic value for patients with advanced gastric cancer and assist to improve clinical outcomes for GC patients.","Zeng, L-S; Liu, C; Guan, T-P; Liao, Q-X; He, Q-J; Wen, Y-F; Yang, X-Z; Cui, S-Z",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202008_22481; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32767324/,254

In this study we used the opioid antagonist naltrexone (NTX) to invoke a continuous (High Dose NTX, HDN) or intermittent (Low Dose NTX, LDN) opioid receptor blockade in order to elucidate the role of native opioid peptides in EAE. A mouse model of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-induced EAE was employed in conjunction with daily treatment of LDN (0.1 mg/kg, NTX), HDN (10 mg/kg NTX), or vehicle (saline). No differences in neurological status (incidence, severity, disease index), or neuropathological assessment (activated astrocytes, demyelination, neuronal injury), were noted between MOG-induced mice receiving HDN or vehicle. Over 33% of the MOG-treated animals receiving LDN did not exhibit behavioral signs of disease, and the severity and disease index of the LDN-treated mice were markedly reduced from cohorts injected with vehicle. Although all LDN animals demonstrated neuropathological signs of EAE, LDN-treated mice without behavioral signs of disease had markedly lower levels of activated astrocytes and demyelination than LDN- or vehicle-treated animals with disease. These results imply that endogenous opioids, evoked by treatment with LDN and acting in the rebound period from drug exposure, are inhibitory to the onset and progression of EAE, and suggest that clinical studies of LDN are merited in MS and possibly in other autoimmune disorders.","Zagon, Ian S; Rahn, Kristen A; Turel, Anthony P; McLaughlin, Patricia J",Experimental biology and medicine,https://doi.org/10.3181/0906-rm-189; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19855075/,254

Increasing breastfeeding rates in Black communities is an important public health strategy to address maternal and infant mortality and morbidity. Methods: Data trends for the past 10 years suggest that Black-led community efforts; local, state, and national initiatives; and maternity care practices that are supportive of breastfeeding have been effective in improving and increasing breastfeeding rates among Black women. Results: Yet breastfeeding disparities and inequities in Black communities persist. Systemic and structural barriers, such as racism, bias, and inequitable access to lactation resources and support continue to be issues in the United States. Conclusion: Going forward, significant investments are needed to decolonize breastfeeding research and clinical practice.

80024,Self-Centering Second-Generation Patient-specific Functionalized Implants for Deep Orbital Reconstruction.,2020-12-29,"The rational integration of chemotherapy and hydroxyl radical (·OH)-mediated chemodynamic therapy (CDT) holds great potential for cancer treatment. Herein, a smart biocompatible nanocatalyst based on porous core-shell cuprous oxide nanocrystals (Cu2 O-PEG (polyethylene glycol) NCs) is reported for acid-triggered chemo/chemodynamic synergistic therapy. The in situ formed high density of hydrophilic PEG outside greatly improves the stability and compatibility of NCs. The porosity of Cu2 O-PEG NCs shows the admirable capacity of doxorubicin (DOX) loading (DOX@Cu2 O-PEG NCs) and delivery. Excitingly, Cu (Cu+/2+ ) and DOX can be controllably released from DOX@Cu2 O-PEG NCs in a pH-responsive approach. The released Cu+ exerts Fenton-like catalytic activity to generate toxic ·OH from intracellular overexpressed hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2 ) for CDT via reactive oxygen species (ROS)-involved oxidative damage. Exactly, DOX can not only induce cell death for chemotherapy but also enhance CDT by self-supplying endogenous H2 O2 . After the intravenous injection, Cu2 O-PEG NCs can effectively accumulate in tumor region via passive targeting improved by external high-density PEG shell. Additionally, the effect of boosted CDT combined with chemotherapy presents excellent in vivo antitumor ability without causing distinct systemic toxicity. It is believed that this smart nanocatalyst responding to the acidity provides a novel paradigm for site-specific cancer synergetic therapy.","Wu, Hongshuai; Chen, Fanghui; You, Chaoqun; Zhang, Yu; Sun, Baiwang; Zhu, Qing",Small,https://doi.org/10.1002/smll.202001805; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33079449/,254
82156,Comparison of Mortality Among Participants of Women's Health Initiative Trials With Screening-Detected Breast Cancers vs Interval Breast Cancers.,2020-06-01,"PURPOSE The purpose of this study was to evaluate the use of telemedicine amid the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in patients with cancer and assess barriers to its implementation. PATIENTS AND METHODS Telehealth video visits, using the Houston Methodist MyChart platform, were offered to patients with cancer as an alternative to in-person visits. Reasons given by patients who declined to use video visits were documented, and demographic information was collected from all patients. Surveys were used to assess the levels of satisfaction of treating physicians and patients who agreed to video visits. RESULTS Of 1,762 patients with cancer who were offered telehealth video visits, 1,477 (83.8%) participated. The patients who declined participation were older (67.7 v 60.2 years; P < .0001), lived in significantly lower-income areas (P = .0021), and were less likely to have commercial insurance (P < .0001) than patients who participated. Most participating patients (92.6%) were satisfied with telehealth video visits. A majority of physicians (65.2%) were also satisfied with its use, and 74% indicated that they would likely use telemedicine in the future. Primary concerns that physicians had in using this technology were inadequate patient interactions and acquisition of medical data, increased potential for missing significant clinical findings, decreased quality of care, and potential medical liability. CONCLUSION Oncology/hematology patients and their physicians expressed high levels of satisfaction with the use of telehealth video visits. Despite recent advances in technology, there are still opportunities to improve the equal implementation of telemedicine for the medical care of vulnerable older, low-income, and underinsured patient populations.","Darcourt, Jorge G; Aparicio, Kalia; Dorsey, Phillip M; Ensor, Joe E; Zsigmond, Eva M; Wong, Stephen T; Ezeana, Chika F; Puppala, Mamta; Heyne, Kirk E; Geyer, Charles E; Phillips, Robert A; Schwartz, Roberta L; Chang, Jenny C",JCO oncology practice,https://doi.org/10.1200/op.20.00572; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33026951/,254

OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to explore the setup, design, facilities, and strategic priorities of leading United Kingdom and United States health care innovation centers to identify transferable lessons for accelerating their creation and maximizing their impact. METHODS We conducted qualitative case studies consisting of semistructured, audio-recorded interviews with decision makers and center staff in 6 innovation centers. We also conducted nonparticipant observations of meetings and center tours, where we took field notes. Qualitative data were analyzed initially within and then across cases facilitated by QSR International's NVivo software. RESULTS The centers had different institutional arrangements, including university-associated institutes or innovation laboratories, business accelerators or incubators, and academic health science partnership models. We conducted interviews with 34 individuals, 1 group interview with 3 participants, and observations of 4 meetings. Although the centers differed significantly in relation to their mission, structure, and governance, we observed key common characteristics. These included high-level leadership support and incentives to engage in innovation activities, a clear mission to address identified gaps within their respective organizational and health system settings, physical spaces that facilitated networking through open-door policies, flat managerial structures characterized by new organizational roles for which boundary spanning was key, and a wider innovation ecosystem that was strategically and proactively engaged with the center facilitating external partnerships. CONCLUSIONS Although innovation in health care settings is unpredictable, we offer insights that may help those establishing innovation centers. The key in this respect is the ability to support different kinds of innovations at different stages through adequate support structures, including the development of new career pathways.","Cresswell, Kathrin; Williams, Robin; Carlile, Narath; Sheikh, Aziz",Journal of medical Internet research,https://doi.org/10.2196/19644; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32975524/,254

Agricultural Beneficial Management Practices (BMPs) are commonly used to reduce excessive nutrient runoff and improve water quality. The successful uptake of BMPs not only depends on their effectiveness but also on their costs of implementation. This study conducts a set of cost-effectiveness analyses to help stakeholders identify their preferred combinations of BMPs in the Qu'Appelle River Basin, a typical watershed in the Canadian Prairies. The considered BMPs are related to cattle and cropping farms and are initially selected by agricultural producers in this region. The analyses use a water quality model to estimate the impact of implementing BMPs on nutrient export, and the cost estimation model to approximate the cost of implementing BMPs at tributary and watershed scales. Our results show that BMPs' effectiveness, total costs of implementation and costs per kilogram of nutrient abatement vary between tributaries. However, wetland conservation is among the optimal practices to improve water quality across the watershed. It is also found that the rates of BMP adoption by stakeholders can influence the effectiveness of practices in a large watershed scale, which highlights the importance of stakeholder engagement in water quality management. This type of analyses can help stakeholders choose single or a combination of BMPs according to their available budget and acceptable levels of reduction in nutrients.","Zammali, Mohamed Khalil; Hassanzadeh, Elmira; Shupena-Soulodre, Etienne; Lindenschmidt, Karl-Erich",Journal of environmental management,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.112336; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33740750/,254

92138,Influence of Cognitive Functioning on Powered Mobility Device Use: Protocol for a Systematic Review.,2020-03-25,"BACKGROUND Laparoscopic gastric bypass (LGBP) is the most common bariatric procedure worldwide. The gastrojejunostomy can be stapled with a circular or linear stapler, each with their own specific advantages. We have evaluated differences in postoperative complications between the two techniques. METHODS We studied operative data and postoperative complications in 560 patients (79.8 % females, median age 42, BMI 42.5) operated with LGBP between 2008 and 2012 at our center. The gastrojejunostomy was initially performed using a circular stapler (CS) in 288 patients and later by linear stapler (LS) in 272. Complications, operative time, and length of stay were retrieved from our database. The risk of developing a port site infection was evaluated with multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS Port site infections were more common with CS than LS, 5.2 and 0.4 %, respectively (p < 0.01). Multivariate analysis demonstrated CS to be an independent risk factor for port site infections (OR 16.3 (2.09-126), p < 0.01), as well as for stomal ulcers (OR 10.1, 1.15-89, p = 0.04). Major postoperative complications remained unchanged (anastomotic leak 1.0 vs. 1.1 %, abscess 0.7 vs. 0.4 %), while operative time and length of stay were found to be shorter using the LS (122 vs. 83 min, p < 0.001 and 4 vs. 3 days, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS The linear stapled technique yielded lower incidence of port site infections, probably by avoiding the passage of a contaminated circular stapler through the abdominal wall. No difference in major complications was seen, but operative time was shorter using a linear stapler instead of a circular stapler.","Sima, E; Hedberg, J; Ehrenborg, A; Sundbom, M",Obesity surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-013-1139-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24323525/,254

Double mutants of nkd1 and nkd2 (nkd1,2) show multiple aleurone (AL) cell layers with disrupted AL cell differentiation, whereas mutants of thk1 cause multiple cell layers of fully differentiated AL cells. Here, we conducted a comparative analysis of nkd1,2 and thk1 mutant endosperm transcriptomes to study how these factors regulate gene networks to control AL layer specification and cell differentiation. Weighted gene coexpression network analysis was incorporated with published laser capture microdissected transcriptome datasets to identify a coexpression module associated with AL development. In this module, both Nkd1,2+ and Thk1+ appear to regulate cell cycle and division, whereas Nkd1,2+, but not Thk1+, regulate auxin signaling. Further investigation of nkd1,2 differentially expressed genes combined with published putative targets of auxin response factors (ARFs) identified 61 AL-preferential genes that may be directly activated by NKD-modulated ARFs. All 61 genes were upregulated in nkd1,2 mutant and the enriched Gene Ontology terms suggested that they are associated with hormone crosstalk, lipid metabolism, and developmental growth. Expression of a transgenic DR5-red fluorescent protein auxin reporter was significantly higher in nkd1,2 mutant endosperm than in wild type, supporting the prediction that Nkd1,2+ negatively regulate auxin signaling in developing AL. Overall, these results suggest that Nkd1,2+ and Thk1+ may normally restrict AL development to a single cell layer by limiting cell division, and that Nkd1,2+ restrict auxin signaling in the AL to maintain normal cell patterning and differentiation processes.","Wu, Hao; Becraft, Philip W",The plant genome,https://doi.org/10.1002/tpg2.20126; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34323399/,254

97432,The impact of communicating personal mental ill-health risk: A randomized controlled non-inferiority trial.,2020-09-15,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS Burnout is an important occupational hazard and the scale of the problem within gastroenterology remains poorly understood. The primary objective of this study was to understand the prevalence of burnout in gastroenterology and ascertain if there was a common prevalence within the field. The secondary objective was to identify factors and job-related stressors that commonly contribute to burnout in gastroenterologists. METHODS Systematic searches were conducted in PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane and PsycINFO by two reviewers independently for articles published to 1 September 2020. The primary outcome measure was the reported prevalence of burnout in gastroenterologists. The secondary outcome measures were (i) the prevalence of non-somatic burnout symptoms (emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and low personal accomplishment) and (ii) the frequency of risk factors and stressors reported in studies. Data were presented and limited meta-analyses discussed. RESULTS Data were extracted from 11 studies. 54.5% (6/11) of these studies reported the prevalence of burnout in gastroenterologists; this ranged from 18.3% to 64.4%. Similar to burnout prevalence, burnout symptoms showed geographical variation and were common in gastroenterologists (up to 63.9%). Factors associated with work volume, age, and female gender were the three most frequently reported risk factors for increased levels of stress and burnout in 72.7% (8/11), 54.5% (6/11), and 45.5% (5/11) of studies respectively. Significant methodological and clinical heterogeneity was observed. CONCLUSIONS Burnout and its non-somatic symptoms are common in gastroenterologists but the syndrome is understudied within the field. Further research and good quality data are needed to help address the problem.","Ong, John; Swift, Carla; Bath, Michael; Ong, Sharon; Lim, Wanyen; Al-Naeeb, Yasseen; Shankar, Arun; Dan, Yock Young",Journal of gastroenterology and hepatology,https://doi.org/10.1111/jgh.15488; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33704827/,254

98503,Respiratory problems in low-resource settings.,2017,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES Stroke is a leading cause of disability worldwide, and a significant proportion of stroke survivors require long-term institutional care. Understanding who cannot be discharged home is important for health and social care planning. Our aim was to establish predictive factors for discharge to institutional care after hospitalization for stroke. DESIGN We registered and conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis (PROSPERO: CRD42015023497) of observational studies. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL Plus to February 2017. Quantitative synthesis was performed where data allowed. SETTING Acute and rehabilitation hospitals. PARTICIPANTS Adults hospitalized for stroke who were newly admitted directly to long-term institutional care at the time of hospital discharge. MEASUREMENTS Factors associated with new institutionalization. RESULTS From 10,420 records, we included 18 studies (n = 32,139 participants). The studies were heterogeneous and conducted in Europe, North America, and East Asia. Eight studies were at high risk of selection bias. The proportion of those surviving to discharge who were newly discharged to long-term care varied from 7% to 39% (median 17%, interquartile range 12%), and the model of care received in the long-term care setting was not defined. Older age and greater stroke severity had a consistently positive association with the need for long-term care admission. Individuals who had a severe stroke were 26 times as likely to be admitted to long-term care than those who had a minor stroke. Individuals aged 65 and older had a risk of stroke that was three times as great as that of younger individuals. Potentially modifiable factors were rarely examined. CONCLUSION Age and stroke severity are important predictors of institutional long-term care admission directly from the hospital after an acute stroke. Potentially modifiable factors should be the target of future research. Stroke outcome studies should report discharge destination, defining the model of care provided in the long-term care setting.","Burton, Jennifer K; Ferguson, Eilidh E C; Barugh, Amanda J; Walesby, Katherine E; MacLullich, Alasdair M J; Shenkin, Susan D; Quinn, Terry J",Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/jgs.15101; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28991368/,254

99591,Why is mock care not a good proxy for predicting hand contamination during patient care?,2020-11-30,"Groundwater is a vital source of freshwater in both urban and rural regions of the world. However, its injudicious abstraction and rapidly increasing contamination are posing a severe threat for sustainable water supply worldwide. Geographical Information System (GIS)-based groundwater quality evaluation using Groundwater Quality Index (GQI) has been proved to be a cost-effective tool for assessing groundwater quality and its variability at a larger scale. However, the conventional GQI approach is unable to deal with uncertainties involved in the assessment of environmental problems. To overcome this limitation, a novel hybrid framework integrating Fuzzy Logic with the GIS-based GQI is proposed in this study for assessing groundwater quality and its spatial variability. The proposed hybrid framework is demonstrated through a case study in a hard-rock terrain of Southern India using ten prominent groundwater-quality parameters measured during pre-monsoon and post-monsoon seasons. Two conventional GIS-based GQI models GQI-10 (using all the ten groundwater-quality parameters) and GQI-7 (using seven 'concerned/critical' groundwater-quality parameters) as well as hybrid Fuzzy-GIS-based GQI (FGQI) models (using seven critical parameters) were developed for the two seasons and the results were compared. The Trapezoidal membership functions classified the model input parameters into 'desirable', 'acceptable' and 'unacceptable' classes based on the experts' knowledge and water quality standards for drinking purposes. The concentrations of Ca2+, Mg2+, and SO42- in groundwater were found within the WHO desirable limits for drinking water throughout the year, while the concentrations of seven parameters (TDS, NO3--N, Na+, Cl-, K+, F- and Hardness) exceed their permissible limits during pre-monsoon and post-monsoon seasons. A comparative evaluation of GQI models revealed that the FGQI model predicts groundwater quality better than the conventional GQI-10 and GQI-7 models. GQI modeling results suggest that the groundwater of most of eastern and southern parts (∼60% in pre-monsoon season; ∼90% in post-monsoon season) of the study area is unsuitable for drinking. Further, the groundwater quality deteriorates during post-monsoon seasons compared to pre-monsoon seasons, which indicates an increased influx of contaminants from different industries, mining areas, waste disposal sites and agricultural fields during monsoon seasons. This finding calls for the strict enforcement of regulations for proper handling of effluents from various contamination sources in the study area. It is concluded that the fuzzy logic-based decision-making approach (FGQI) is more reliable and pragmatic for groundwater-quality assessment and analysis at a larger scale. It can serve as a useful tool for the water planners and decision makers in efficiently monitoring and managing groundwater quality at watershed or basin scales.","Jha, Madan Kumar; Shekhar, Ankit; Jenifer, M Annie",Water research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2020.115867; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408184/,254

Our objective was to produce the Periodontal Senior Case Clinical Challenge (PSCCC) that would provide fourth-year students an alternative for senior case presentations and would be a formative assessment for which student opinions would be provided and analyzed. The PSCCC would utilize an online, case-based, written, clinical assessment, and follow-up, structured discussion to challenge students to demonstrate ability to apply didactic periodontal knowledge to patient-based experiences. We hypothesized the PSCCC would provide effective learning and a formative assessment. MATERIAL AND METHODS Relevant didactic resources were distributed to 48 students for independent review. The PSCCC was delivered in two sections, (1) a case-based assessment via a virtual classroom with written student responses, and (2) oral discussions conducted via virtual meetings that were moderated and assessed by ten periodontists, with the collaboration of nine residents. A voluntary six-statement survey was used to evaluate the students' opinions of the PSCCC. The scores for 75% (36/48) of students who participated were evaluated for statistical and clinical importance. RESULTS The value of our PSCCC was supported by 91.7% (33/36) of the analyses (P ≤ 0.0008). DISCUSSION The PSCCC was a successful alternative pathway to assess students' clinical and didactic integrated knowledge in periodontics. It provided a unified vision of treatment of the selected case, building on all aspects of the students' periodontal education while allowing interaction in a simultaneous, three-tiered educational approach, involving dental students, periodontal residents, and faculty. CONCLUSION In support of our hypothesis, for each of the 6 statements, ≥ 94.44% (34/36) of the scores given by the students were considered exceptionally strong clinical support for our pedagogical strategy that combines educational resources and can be successfully implemented in other programs.","Garcia, M Nathalia; Whitener, Sara J; Ghassemi, Amirezza; Bitter, Robert; Miley, Douglas; Naylor, Jeffrey; Drukteinis, Saulius; Hildebolt, Charles F",European journal of dental education : official journal of the Association for Dental Education in Europe,https://doi.org/10.1111/eje.12657; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33386660/,254
100196,Covid-19 and Diabetes in Hawaii.,2020-06-02,"INTRODUCTION This paper is a report of a qualitative study of emergency and critical care nurses' perceptions of occupational response and preparedness during infectious respiratory disease outbreaks including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and influenza. PROBLEM Healthcare workers, predominantly female, face occupational and personal challenges in their roles as first responders/first receivers. Exposure to SARS or other respiratory pathogens during pregnancy represents additional occupational risk for healthcare workers. METHODS Perceptions of occupational reproductive risk during response to infectious respiratory disease outbreaks were assessed qualitatively by five focus groups comprised of 100 Canadian nurses conducted between 2005 and 2006. RESULTS Occupational health and safety issues anticipated by Canadian nurses for future infectious respiratory disease outbreaks were grouped into four major themes: (1) apprehension about occupational risks to pregnant nurses; (2) unknown pregnancy risks of anti-infective therapy/prophylaxis; (3) occupational risk communication for pregnant nurses; and (4) human resource strategies required for pregnant nurses during outbreaks. The reproductive risk perceptions voiced by Canadian nurses generally were consistent with reported case reports of pregnant women infected with SARS or emerging influenza strains. Nurses' fears of fertility risks posed by exposure to infectious agents or anti-infective therapy and prophylaxis are not well supported by the literature, with the former not biologically plausible and the latter lacking sufficient data. CONCLUSIONS Reproductive risk assessments should be performed for each infectious respiratory disease outbreak to provide female healthcare workers and in particular pregnant women with guidelines regarding infection control and use of anti-infective therapy and prophylaxis.","Phillips, Karen P; O'Sullivan, Tracey L; Dow, Darcie; Amaratunga, Carol A",Prehospital and disaster medicine,https://doi.org/10.1017/s1049023x11000100; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21888731/,254
100383,Challenges in the Care of Children and Youth With Diabetes in Times of the Corona Pandemic: Personal View of the Situation in a German Clinic.,2020-05-29,"BACKGROUND Thrombolytic therapy for acute ischemic stroke with a lower-than-standard dose of intravenous alteplase may improve recovery along with a reduced risk of intracerebral hemorrhage. METHODS Using a 2-by-2 quasi-factorial open-label design, we randomly assigned 3310 patients who were eligible for thrombolytic therapy (median age, 67 years; 63% Asian) to low-dose intravenous alteplase (0.6 mg per kilogram of body weight) or the standard dose (0.9 mg per kilogram); patients underwent randomization within 4.5 hours after the onset of stroke. The primary objective was to determine whether the low dose would be noninferior to the standard dose with respect to the primary outcome of death or disability at 90 days, which was defined by scores of 2 to 6 on the modified Rankin scale (range, 0 [no symptoms] to 6 [death]). Secondary objectives were to determine whether the low dose would be superior to the standard dose with respect to centrally adjudicated symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage and whether the low dose would be noninferior in an ordinal analysis of modified Rankin scale scores (testing for an improvement in the distribution of scores). The trial included 935 patients who were also randomly assigned to intensive or guideline-recommended blood-pressure control. RESULTS The primary outcome occurred in 855 of 1607 participants (53.2%) in the low-dose group and in 817 of 1599 participants (51.1%) in the standard-dose group (odds ratio, 1.09; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.95 to 1.25; the upper boundary exceeded the noninferiority margin of 1.14; P=0.51 for noninferiority). Low-dose alteplase was noninferior in the ordinal analysis of modified Rankin scale scores (unadjusted common odds ratio, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.89 to 1.13; P=0.04 for noninferiority). Major symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage occurred in 1.0% of the participants in the low-dose group and in 2.1% of the participants in the standard-dose group (P=0.01); fatal events occurred within 7 days in 0.5% and 1.5%, respectively (P=0.01). Mortality at 90 days did not differ significantly between the two groups (8.5% and 10.3%, respectively; P=0.07). CONCLUSIONS This trial involving predominantly Asian patients with acute ischemic stroke did not show the noninferiority of low-dose alteplase to standard-dose alteplase with respect to death and disability at 90 days. There were significantly fewer symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhages with low-dose alteplase.

101457,The Needs of Families During Cardiac Arrest Care: A Survivor- and Family-led Scoping Review Protocol.,2021-04-27,"BACKGROUND The IMS III trial did not show a clinical benefit of endovascular treatment compared with intravenous alteplase (recombinant tissue plasminogen activator) alone for moderate or severe ischaemic strokes. Late reperfusion of tissue that was no longer salvageable could be one explanation, as suggested by previous exploratory studies that showed an association between time to reperfusion and good clinical outcome. We sought to validate this association in a preplanned analysis of data from the IMS III trial. METHODS We used data for patients with complete proximal arterial occlusions in the anterior circulation who received endovascular treatment and achieved angiographic reperfusion (score on Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction scale of grade 2-3) during the endovascular procedure (within 7 h of symptom onset). We used logistic regression to model good clinical outcome (defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of 0-2 at 3 months) as a function of the time to reperfusion. We prespecified variables to be considered for adjustment, including age, baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, sex, and baseline blood glucose concentration. FINDINGS Of 240 patients who were otherwise eligible for inclusion in our analysis, 182 (76%) achieved angiographic reperfusion. Mean time from symptom onset to reperfusion (ie, procedure end) was 325 min (SD 52). Increased time to reperfusion was associated with a decreased likelihood of good clinical outcome (unadjusted relative risk for every 30-min delay 0·85 [95% CI 0·77-0·94]; adjusted relative risk 0·88 [0·80-0·98]). INTERPRETATION Delays in time to angiographic reperfusion lead to a decreased likelihood of good clinical outcome in patients after moderate to severe stroke. Rapid reperfusion could be crucial for the success of future acute endovascular trials.

102656,The Rapid Transition to Telemedicine and Its Effect on Access to Care for Patients With Type 1 Diabetes During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2021-04-13,"BACKGROUND In radiotherapy, temporary translocations of the internal organs and tumor induced by respiratory and cardiac activities can undesirably lead to significantly lower radiation dose on the targeted tumor but more harmful radiation on surrounding healthy tissues. Respiratory and cardiac gated radiotherapy offers a potential solution for the treatment of tumors located in the upper thorax. The present study focuses on the design and development of simultaneous acquisition of respiratory and cardiac signal using electrical impedance technology for use in dual gated radiotherapy. METHODS An electronic circuitry was developed for monitoring the bio-impedance change due to respiratory and cardiac motions and extracting the cardiogenic ECG signal. The system was analyzed in terms of reliability of signal acquisition, time delay, and functionality in a high energy radiation environment. The resulting signal of the system developed was also compared with the output of the commercially available Real-time Position Management™ (RPM) system in both time and frequency domains. RESULTS The results demonstrate that the bioimpedance-based method can potentially provide reliable tracking of respiratory and cardiac motion in humans, alternative to currently available methods. When compared with the RPM system, the impedance-based system developed in the present study shows similar output pattern but different sensitivities in monitoring different respiratory rates. The tracking of cardiac motion was more susceptible to interference from other sources than respiratory motion but also provided synchronous output compared with the ECG signal extracted. The proposed hardware-based implementation was observed to have a worst-case time delay of approximately 33 ms for respiratory monitoring and 45 ms for cardiac monitoring. No significant effect on the functionality of the system was observed when it was tested in a radiation environment with the electrode lead wires directly exposed to high-energy X-Rays. CONCLUSION The developed system capable of rendering quality signals for tracking both respiratory and cardiac motions can potentially provide a solution for simultaneous dual-gated radiotherapy.","Kohli, Kirpal; Liu, Jeff; Schellenberg, Devin; Karvat, Anand; Parameswaran, Ash; Grewal, Parvind; Thomas, Steven",Biomedical engineering online,https://doi.org/10.1186/1475-925x-13-144; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25316509/,254

Despite some remarkable successes, cell-level evolution remains a potent antagonist to this approach. We suggest that a deeper understanding of the breakdown of cooperation can synergize the evolutionary and druggable-targets approaches. Complexity requires cooperation, whether between cells of different species (symbiosis) or between cells of the same organism (multicellularity). Both forms of cooperation may be associated with nutrient scarcity, which in turn may be associated with a chemiosmotic metabolism. A variety of examples from modern organisms supports these generalities. Indeed, mammalian cancers-unicellular, glycolytic, and fast-replicating-parallel these examples. Nutrient scarcity, chemiosmosis, and associated signaling may favor cooperation, while under conditions of nutrient abundance a fermentative metabolism may signal the breakdown of cooperation. Manipulating this metabolic milieu may potentiate the effects of targeted therapeutics. Specific opportunities are discussed in this regard, including avicins, a novel plant product.","Blackstone, Neil W; Gutterman, Jordan U","BioEssays : news and reviews in molecular, cellular and developmental biology",https://doi.org/10.1002/bies.202000160; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33165962/,254

This review will outline technological responses to this need and the analytical considerations required for their translation to routine use. RECENT FINDINGS SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic solutions directly detect a virus or measure host-derived surrogate markers of infection. With pressure upon supply chains for the 'traditional' molecular approaches, a wide variety of analytical tools spanning the molecular, serology, imaging and chemistry space are being developed, including high throughput solutions and simplified near-patient formats. SUMMARY The unique genetic nature of SARS-CoV-2 means high analytical specificity is achievable by most diagnostic formats. However, clinical sensitivity assessment is complicated by wide discrepancies in analytical range and challenges associated with standardising these differences. When coupled with the acute nature of SARS-CoV-2 infection, reported precise metrics of test performance must be questioned. The response to SARS-CoV-2 has delivered considerable diagnostic innovation, but for a technology to be maximised, it must be demonstrably reproducible and fit for purpose. If novel diagnostic solutions for SARS-CoV-2 are to succeed, equally innovative mechanisms are needed to ensure widespread clinical and surveillance application, enabling agreed standards and metrics to ensure comparability.","Huggett, Jim F; Moran-Gilad, Jacob; Lee, J Eugene",Current opinion in pulmonary medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/mcp.0000000000000768; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33654014/,254

107571,Symptom burden and clinical profile of COVID-19 deaths: a rapid systematic review and evidence summary.,2020-05-28,"BACKGROUND To examine the contribution of generational epigenetic dysregulation to the inception of obesity and its adiposopathic consequences. METHODS Sources for this review included searches of PubMed, Google Scholar, and international government/major association websites using terms including adiposity, adiposopathy, epigenetics, genetics, and obesity. RESULTS Excessive energy storage in adipose tissue often results in fat cell and fat organ dysfunction, which may cause metabolic and fat mass disorders. The adverse clinical manifestations of obesity are not solely due to the amount of body fat (adiposity), but are also dependent on anatomical and functional perturbations (adiposopathy or 'sick fat'). This review describes extragenetic factors and genetic conditions that promote obesity. It also serves as an introduction to epigenetic dysregulation (i.e., abnormalities in gene expression that occur without alteration in the genetic code itself), which may contribute to obesity and adiposopathic metabolic health outcomes in offspring. Within the epigenetic paradigm, obesity is a transgenerational disease, with weight lost or gained by either parent potentially impacting generational risk for obesity and its complications. CONCLUSIONS Epigenetics may be an important contributor to the emergence of obesity and its complications as global epidemics. Although transgenerational epigenetic influences present challenges, they may also present interventional opportunities, via justifying weight management for individuals before, during, and after pregnancy and for future generations.","Bays, Harold; Scinta, Wendy",Current medical research and opinion,https://doi.org/10.1185/03007995.2015.1087983; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26331354/,254

It is important to reflect on our stories, identify the myriad of emotions we are experiencing, and find ways to work through our feelings. Ignoring, denying, or suppressing feelings does not serve us well in the long run. Stifling negative emotions does not make them go away.

Bronchiectasis is largely idiopathic although there is diverse aetiology. The pathogenesis of bronchiectasis comprises infective, inflammatory and emzymetic elements. These interact to perpetuate continued airway damage in bronchiectasis leading to progressive airway and lung damages. Treatment of bronchiectasis is unsatisfactory and there are only very few trials. Existing data suggest some efficacy of inhaled corticosteroid therapy, which has been shown recently to clinical and anti-inflammatory properties in bronchiectasis. Immunomodulating agent such as low-dose macrolides have also been shown to have some efficacy although more data are needed to advocate their long-term usage. Antibiotic therapy is complex in bronchiectasis and includes short-term empirical treatment for acute exacerbation, and consideration of long-term maintenance of oral, nebulized and i.v. therapy.

Polymer macromolecules can be an alternative to the accepted forms of treatment. Polymeric substances can be used as drugs or as adjuvants in vaccines. The most important feature of polymers is their advanced structure and the ability to construct the molecule from scratch, giving it the desired properties. Antiviral properties are influenced by, among other things, electrical charge, form and structure, and composition with other polymers or heavy metals. Depending on the expected properties, molecules can be built from scratch to be capable of transporting drugs or improve the effectiveness of the right drug. They can also be antiviral drugs in themselves. Polymeric compounds allow to reduce the frequency of adverse effects and improve the effect of the drug. They can have a direct antiviral effect by upsetting the lipid membrane of the surrounding viruses. Antiviral action of polymers occurs because of the properties of the polymers alone or in combination with other molecules. Viral epidemics are a motivation for research that can help stop a global pandemic in the future.","Stojanowski, Jakub; Gołębiowski, Tomasz",Polimery w medycynie,https://doi.org/10.17219/pim/131644; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33481360/,254
109624,Pandemic Boosts an Old Idea-Bringing Acute Care to the Patient.,2021-04-14,"Emerging technologies use cell plasma membrane vesicles or ""blebs"" as an intermediate to form molecularly complete, planar cell surface mimetics that are compatible with a variety of characterization tools and microscopy methods. This approach enables direct incorporation of membrane proteins into supported lipid bilayers without using detergents and reconstitution and preserves native lipids and membrane species. Such a system can be advantageous as in vitro models of in vivo cell surfaces for study of the roles of membrane proteins as drug targets in drug delivery, host-pathogen interactions, tissue engineering, and many other bioanalytical and sensing applications. However, the impact of methods used to induce cell blebbing (vesiculation) on protein and membrane properties is still unknown. This study focuses on characterization of cell blebs created under various bleb-inducing conditions and the result on protein properties (orientation, mobility, activity, etc.) and lipid scrambling in this platform. The orientation of proteins in the cell blebs and planar bilayers is revealed using a protease cleavage assay. Lipid scrambling in both cell blebs and planar bilayers is indicated through an annexin V binding assay. To quantify protein confinement, immobility, etc., incorporation of GPI-linked yellow fluorescent protein (GPI-YFP) was used in conjunction with single-molecule tracking (SMT) microscopy. Finally, to investigate the impact of the bleb induction method on protein activity and expression level, cell blebs expressing human aminopeptidase N (hAPN) were analyzed by an enzyme activity assay and immunoblotting. This work enriches our understanding of cell plasma membrane bleb bilayers as a biomimetic platform, reveals conditions under which specific properties are met, and represents one of the few ways to make molecularly complete supported bilayers directly from cell plasma membranes.","Liu, Han-Yuan; Grant, Hannah; Hsu, Hung-Lun; Sorkin, Raya; Bošković, Filip; Wuite, Gijs; Daniel, Susan",ACS applied materials & interfaces,https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.7b07500; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28930438/,254

Characterizing these assays provides scientific basis to best use them. The current study assessed one chemiluminescent assay (Abbott COVID-2 IgG) and two lateral flow assays (STANDARD Q [SQ] IgM/IgG Duo and Wondfo Total Antibody Test) using 113 blood samples from 71 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 hospitalized patients, 119 samples with potential cross-reactions, and 1068 negative controls including 942 pre-pandemic samples. SARS-CoV-2 IgM antibodies became detectable 3-4 days post-symptom onset using SQ IgM test and IgG antibodies were first detected 5-6 days post-onset using SQ IgG. Abbott IgG and Wondfo Total were able to detect antibodies 7-8 days post-onset. After 14 days post-symptom onset, the SQ IgG, Abbott IgG and Wondfo Total tests were able to detect antibodies from 100% of the PCR-confirmed patients in this series; 87.5% sensitivity for SQ IgM. Overall agreement was 88.5% between SQ IgM/IgG and Wondfo Total and 94.6% between SQ IgG and Abbott IgG. No cross-reaction due to recent sera with three of the endemic coronaviruses was observed. Viral hepatitis and autoimmune samples were the main source of limited cross-reactions. The specificities were 100% for SQ IgG and Wondfo Total, 99.62% for Abbott IgG, and 98.87% for SQ IgM.

111158,Short-term morbidity and mortality following radical cystectomy: a systematic review.,2021-04-14,"BACKGROUND Hospitals need to prevent, respond to, and learn from safety risks and events perceived by patients and families, who in turn rely on nurses to respond to and report their safety concerns. OBJECTIVES To describe the process by which bedside nurses evaluate and determine the appropriate response to safety concerns expressed by patients or their families. METHODS A qualitative design was employed. We recruited inpatient bedside nurses in an 811-bed Midwest academic medical center. Nurses provided demographic information and participated in semistructured interviews designed to elicit narratives related to evaluation and response to patient- or family-expressed safety concerns. Data analysis and interpretation were guided by grounded theory. RESULTS We enrolled 25 nurses representing 22 units. Based on these nurses' experiences, we developed a grounded theory explaining how nurses evaluate a patient or family safety concern. Nurses make sense of the patient's or family's safety concern in order to take action. Achieving this goal requires evaluation of the meaningfulness and reasonableness of the concern, as well as the potential effect of the concern on the patient. Based on this nursing evaluation, nurses respond in ways designed to (a) manage emotions, (b) immediately resolve concerns, (c) involve other team members, and (d) address fear or uncertain grounding in reality. Nurses reported routinely handling safety concerns at the bedside without use of incident reporting. DISCUSSION Safety requires an interpersonal and evaluative nursing process with actions responsive to patient and family concerns. Safety interventions designed to be used by nurses should be developed with the dynamic, cognitive, sensemaking nature of nurses' routine safety work in mind. Being sensitive to the vulnerability of patients, respecting patient and family input, and understanding the consequences of dismissing patient and family safety concerns is critical to making sense of the situation and taking appropriate action to maintain safety. Measuring patient safety or planning improvement based on patient or family expression of safety concerns would be a difficult undertaking using only standard approaches. A more complex approach incorporating direct patient engagement in data collection is necessary to gain a complete safety picture.","Groves, Patricia S; Bunch, Jacinda L; Cannava, Kaitlin E; Sabadosa, Kathryn A; Williams, Janet K",Nursing research,https://doi.org/10.1097/nnr.0000000000000487; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33264259/,254

For long-term reflux control, laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) may be a better option. This study assessed outcomes and quality-of-life data after fundoplication takedown and conversion to LRYGB for patients with failed fundoplications. METHODS After institutional review board approval, the medical records of 25 patients who underwent fundoplication takedown and LRYGB conversion between March 2007 and July 2011 were reviewed. The data recorded included patient demographics, body mass index (BMI), preoperative symptoms, operative duration and findings, hospital length of stay (LOS), estimated blood loss (EBL), length of the follow-up period, and postoperative outcomes. The gastrointestinal quality of life index (GIQLI) and the gastrointestinal symptoms rating scale (GSRS) were used at the most recent follow-up visit to assess symptom severity and quality of life. RESULTS The patients in this study had undergone 40 total prior antireflux surgeries. They had a median age of 55 years (range 36-72 years), a BMI of 34.4 kg/m(2) (range 22-50 kg/m(2)), an operative duration of 345 min (range 180-600 min), an EBL of 181 ml (range 50-500 ml), and an LOS of 7 days (range 2-30 days). Five patients had concomitant incisional hernia repair. There was no mortality. Of the 10 patients (40%) who had had complications, 5 required reoperation. During a 14-month follow-up period (range 1-48 months), 96% of the patients were reflux-free with a GIQLI score of 114 (range 80-135) and a GSRS score of 25 (range 17-45). Excess weight loss was 60%, and comorbidity resolution was 70%. Most of the patients (96%) were satisfied with their outcome and would undergo the surgery again, and 62% reported that their personal relationships and sexual life had improved. CONCLUSIONS Patients who undergo LRYGB after failed fundoplications have excellent symptomatic control of reflux, excellent quality of life, and high rates of satisfaction with their outcome. Nevertheless, because the procedure is challenging and associated with considerable morbidity, it should be performed by surgeons experienced in antireflux and bariatric surgery.","Stefanidis, Dimitrios; Navarro, Fernando; Augenstein, Vedra A; Gersin, Keith S; Heniford, B Todd",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-012-2380-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22692463/,254

Although the clinical and laboratory characteristics of this illness have been reported in patients from China and Europe, data are scant in the United States. Methods We extracted data regarding all patients hospitalized at our hospital with COVID-19 infection between March 1 and April 4, 2020. Presenting signs and symptoms, laboratory and imaging findings, treatment, and complications were recorded from electronic medical records (EMRs). The primary composite endpoint was admission to intensive care unit (ICU), shock, or death. Results We had a total of 43 patients tested for COVID-19 at the emergency room (ER) or during hospitalization, 16 (37%) of whom were admitted with COVID-19 infection. The mean age was 65.5 years and 75% were males. The most common presenting symptoms were fever (94%), cough (88%), and dyspnea (81%). A loss of smell and taste sensations were reported by three (19%) patients. Low oxygen saturation was present in 38% of patients, whilst 31% were hypotensive on admission. Hyponatremia (50%), elevated C-reactive protein (CRP; 100%), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH; 80%) were common. Acute renal failure, myocardial injury, and elevation in aminotransferases occurred in 69%, 19%, and 38% patients, respectively. The primary composite endpoint occurred in 50% of patients.

AIM This study reports and summarizes the homeopathic symptoms observed in 18 confirmed/suspected epidemiologically related cases in cluster outbreaks of COVID-19 in Hong Kong in early 2020. METHODS Homeopathic symptoms from this case series were collected from 18 consecutive patients who, in addition to their concurrent conventional treatment or traditional Chinese medicine, actively sought help from homeopathy as an adjunctive measure for symptomatic relief from COVID-19. Cases were categorized according to outbreak clusters, focusing mainly on the homeopathic symptoms. In the analysis, frequency of all homeopathic medicines, common rubrics in all the cases, common rubrics in each of the top-ranked remedies, and differentiating symptoms for each top-ranked remedy were determined. RESULTS Homeopathic symptoms of 18 cases, each identified as mild and belonging to one of six separate clusters, are reported. Eighteen common symptoms screened out of 79 selected rubrics constituted two sets of homeopathic symptom pictures: Bryonia alba (n = 4) and Gelsemium sempervirens (n = 12). Eight and seven differentiating features, respectively, were identified for Bryonia alba and Gelsemium sempervirens.

The pathogenic action of the hemoparasites is associated with anemia, weight loss, abortion and reduced productivity, which result with animal death. Programs to prevent CTF involve several procedures, including immunization, chemoprophylaxis and use of ectoparasiticides, together with the vector control in the environment. The objective of this study was to report an acute outbreak of CTF in a group of 157 Hereford cattle from a farm without presence of the vector, that were moved to a farm in the same state with a high tick infestation (Rhipicephalus microplus). On the day before the transportation, the animals received a chemoprophylaxis with imidocarb dipropionate (3 mg/kg, SC), which was repeated 21 days after the first application. After 42 days, some animals showed signs compatible with CTF, which was confirmed through clinical examination, necropsy, histopathological and hemoparasitological analyses. The morbidity rate was 37.6% and the mortality rate was 24.8%. Calves that were recently weaned were the group most affected with the tick fever, morbidity (100% and mortality (73%). Chemoprophylaxis in association with use of ectoparasiticides was not sufficient to control the outbreak of the disease.","Silva, Jerbeson Hoffmann da; Rebesquini, Renata; Setim, Diorges Henrique; Scariot, Cláudia Almeida; Vieira, Maria Isabel Botelho; Zanella, Ricardo; Motta, Adriana Costa da; Alves, Leonardo Porto; Bondan, Carlos",Revista brasileira de parasitologia veterinaria = Brazilian journal of veterinary parasitology : Orgao Oficial do Colegio Brasileiro de Parasitologia Veterinaria,https://doi.org/10.1590/s1984-29612020096; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33263615/,254

MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively reviewed computed tomography (CT) scans from the time of the diagnosis of IPA in 83 hematological malignancy patients with probable or proven IPA according to the EORTC-MSG criteria. We evaluated CT findings (radiological pattern, number of lesions, distribution, and presence of low attenuation area [LAA]), and compared the radiological findings of patients classified by degree of neutropenia with two different indicators (neutrophil count at the onset, and c-d-index) and underlying disease. RESULTS Neutropenia at the onset of IPA was associated with an increased frequency of LAA (p < 0.05), especially in FN (p < 0.01). Cases with a c-d-index of ≧5500 showed an increased incidence of the angio-invasive pattern. In contrast, cases with a c-d-index of 0 showed an increased incidence of the airway-invasive pattern (p < 0.05). The airway-invasive pattern was more frequent in cases with MM, while the angio-invasive pattern was more frequent in cases with AML (p < 0.01). Lower-predominant distribution was more frequent and random distribution was less frequent in cases with AML, random distribution was more frequent and lower-predominant distribution was less frequent in cases with ALL, and upper-predominant distribution was more frequent in cases with MDS (p < 0.05).

117533,Primary balloon dacryoplasty for nasolacrimal duct obstruction in adults: a systematic review.,2020-09-10,"BACKGROUND As an alternative medical system, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has been increasingly used over the last several decades. Such a consumer-driven development has resulted in introduction of education programs for practitioner training, development of product and practitioner regulation systems, and generation of an increasing interest in research. Significant efforts have been made in validating the quality, effectiveness, and safety of TCM interventions evidenced by a growing number of published trials and systematic reviews. Commonly, the results of these studies were inconclusive due to the lack of quality and quantity of the trials to answer specific and answerable clinical questions. OBJECTIVES The methodology of a randomized clinical trial (RCT) is not free from bias, and the unique features of TCM (such as individualization and holism) further complicate effective execution of RCTs in TCM therapies. Thus, data from limited RCTs and systematic reviews need to be interpreted with great caution. Nevertheless, until new and specific methodology is developed that can adequately address these methodology challenges for RCTs in TCM, evidence from quality RCTs and systematic reviews still holds the credibility of TCM in the scientific community. CONCLUSIONS This article summarizes studies on TCM utilization, and regulatory and educational development with a focus on updating the TCM clinical evidence from RCTs and systematic reviews over the last decade. The key issues and challenges associated with evidence-based TCM developments are also explored.","Xue, Charlie C L; Zhang, Anthony L; Greenwood, Kenneth M; Lin, Vivian; Story, David F",Journal of alternative and complementary medicine,https://doi.org/10.1089/acm.2009.0293; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20192915/,254

So far, COVID-19 is not fully contained, and new cases are arising on daily bases in various countries. Due to zoonotic nature and human-to-human spread, COVID-19 is considered pandemic with more causalities in developing countries. Full genome analysis revealed its resemblance with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus with minor variation in non-structural proteins. Both viruses use the common angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE2) receptor to attach to the epithelial cells of the target organs. Currently, COVID-19 patients are treated with drugs that are used for lungs infections. However, ACE2 has high expression in other human organs such as kidney and testes. Thus, it is assumed that, like SARS, it may have adverse effects on other vital organs, which have dominant expression of ACE2. In testis, SARS affected patients displayed peritubular fibrosis, extensive germ cell disruption, damage of blood-testis barrier integrity and more frequent occurrence of apoptosis.

119132,Important role of emergency department doctors after the outbreak of covid-19 in China.,2020-05-03,"Bats harbor a large diversity of coronaviruses (CoVs), several of which are related to zoonotic pathogens that cause severe disease in humans. Our screening of bat samples collected in Kenya from 2007 to 2010 not only detected RNA from several novel CoVs but, more significantly, identified sequences that were closely related to human CoVs NL63 and 229E, suggesting that these two human viruses originate from bats. We also demonstrated that human CoV NL63 is a recombinant between NL63-like viruses circulating in Triaenops bats and 229E-like viruses circulating in Hipposideros bats, with the breakpoint located near 5' and 3' ends of the spike (S) protein gene. In addition, two further interspecies recombination events involving the S gene were identified, suggesting that this region may represent a recombination ""hot spot"" in CoV genomes. Finally, using a combination of phylogenetic and distance-based approaches, we showed that the genetic diversity of bat CoVs is primarily structured by host species and subsequently by geographic distances.IMPORTANCE Understanding the driving forces of cross-species virus transmission is central to understanding the nature of disease emergence. Previous studies have demonstrated that bats are the ultimate reservoir hosts for a number of coronaviruses (CoVs), including ancestors of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and human CoV 229E (HCoV-229E). However, the evolutionary pathways of bat CoVs remain elusive. We provide evidence for natural recombination between distantly related African bat coronaviruses associated with Triaenops afer and Hipposideros sp. bats that resulted in a NL63-like virus, an ancestor of the human pathogen HCoV-NL63. These results suggest that interspecies recombination may play an important role in CoV evolution and the emergence of novel CoVs with zoonotic potential.","Tao, Ying; Shi, Mang; Chommanard, Christina; Queen, Krista; Zhang, Jing; Markotter, Wanda; Kuzmin, Ivan V; Holmes, Edward C; Tong, Suxiang",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01953-16; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28077633/,254

While eConsults have been successfully implemented in many medical specialties, their use in the practice of urology is relatively unknown. Methods We included data from four academic institutions: University of Michigan, University of California -San Francisco, University of Washington, and Montefiore Medical Center. We included every urological eConsult performed at each institution from the launch of their respective programs through August 2019. We considered an eConsult ""converted"" when the participating urologist recommended a full in-person evaluation. We report eConsult conversion rate, response time, completion time, and diagnosis categories. Results A total of 462 urological eConsults were requested. Of these, 36% were converted to a traditional in-person visit. Among resolved eConsults, with data on provider response time available (n=119),53.8% of eConsults were addressed in less than 1 day; 28.6% in 1 day; 8.4% in 2 days; 3.4% in 3 days; 3.4% in 4 days; 1.7% in 5 days; and 0.8% in ≥6 days. Among resolved eConsults, with data on provider completion time available (n=283), 50.2% were completed in 1-10 minutes; 46.7% in 11-20 minutes; 2.8% in 21-30 minutes; and less than 1% in ≥31 minutes. Discussion Our study suggests that eConsults are an effective avenue for urologists to provide recommendations for many common non-surgical urological conditions and thus avoid a traditional in-person for low-complexity situations. Further investigation into the impact of eConsults on healthcare costs and access to urological care are necessary.","Patel, Milan; Gadzinski, Adam J; Bell, Alexander M; Watts, Kara; Steppe, Emma; Odisho, Anobel Y; Yang, Claire C; Ellimoottil, Chad",Urology practice,https://doi.org/10.1097/upj.0000000000000209; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33928183/,254

In this study, the microbial diversity during the wet fermentation of Coffea arabica L. in the Sierra Nevada of Santa Marta (SNSM) in Colombia was explored by high-throughput sequencing and the resulting cup quality through the standards of the Specialty Coffee Association. The taxonomic assignment of sequence reads showed a high microbial diversity comprised of 695 bacterial and 156 fungal genera. The microbial community was dominated by the Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) Leuconostoc, the yeast Kazachstania, and the Acetic Acid Bacteria (AAB) Acetobacter. Co-occurrence relationships suggested synergistic patterns between populations of LAB-AAB, yeasts-AAB, Leuconostoc-Prevotella, LAB-ABB-Selenomonas, and yeasts-fungi-nonLAB-nonAAB, which may result in the production of metabolites that positively impact the sensory attributes of coffee. The beverages produced were classified as specialty coffees, and their score was positively influenced by the fungal richness and the abundance of unclassified Lactobacillales, Pichia, and Pseudomonas. The findings show the richness and microbial diversity of the SNSM and serve as input for future research such as the analysis of microbial-derived metabolites and the establishment of starter cultures in coffee processing that guarantee the generation of high-quality beverages, the standardization of processes, the reduction of economic losses, and the production of value-added products that allow taking advantage of specialty coffee market.","Cruz-O'Byrne, Rosmery; Piraneque-Gambasica, Nelson; Aguirre-Forero, Sonia",International journal of food microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2021.109282; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34140187/,254

BACKGROUND COVID-19 is a highly contagious disease that brings with it fear and anxiety for all involved inclusive of nurses and patients. New guidelines for nurses to follow such as attention to physical distance coupled with the wearing of defined personal protective equipment, gloves, long-sleeved disposable gown, FFP2 face mask, and eye protection places additional strain on nurses to engage therapeutically with patients. Evidence suggests that the wearing of face masks and personal protective equipment act as barriers to effective therapeutic engagement with patients. We found an absence of communication models to help nurses engage therapeutically with patients. DESIGN This is a position paper that draws on previous research to inform the design of a new model for nurses to engage therapeutically with patients suspected of or confirmed with COVID-19. METHOD We reviewed the literature on caring for patients in isolation, the barriers to therapeutic communication and the psychological impact of infectious diseases on nurses and patients. CONCLUSION Remaining emotionally present to self, whilst being present to others can be challenging for nurses in a pandemic environment. We believe that the ""TAGEET"" model (T- Tune-in, A - Approach and introduce, G - Ground self, E - Engage and respond, E - End encounter, T - Tune-out), although devised for nurses to engage therapeutically with patients suspected of or confirmed with COVID-19 could be used by all healthcare professionals in any challenging clinical environment.

While a narrow gender focus alone can reinforce binary and competing understandings of disease burden by gender, an intersectionality approach encourages understanding of the dimensions of power, historical structural inequalities, and the role of social determinants and lived experience to inform a multidimensional, gender-informed response to this and future emerging infectious diseases. We provide specific, actionable recommendations for critical healthcare, public health, and policy to use an intersectional approach to COVID-19 pandemic preparedness, response and resiliency.","Ryan, Nessa E; El Ayadi, Alison M",Global public health,https://doi.org/10.1080/17441692.2020.1791214; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32633628/,254

However, these catheters may be difficult to place in cases of excessive vessel tortuosity, small vessels, and anatomic complexity. Recently, the introduction of the double lumen microballoon catheters for body trunk vascular lesions has allowed operators to advance them into more distal, smaller, and more tortuous vessels. Since the launch of the first generation microballoon catheters onto the market in Japan in 2011, the microballoon catheters have evolved and are now generally available for clinical use. The purpose of this article is to review the evolution and current clinical applications of the microballoon catheters in the field of interventional radiology.","Matsumoto, Tomohiro; Tomita, Kosuke; Suda, Satoshi; Hashida, Kazunobu; Maegawa, Shunto; Hayashi, Toshihiko; Yamagami, Takuji; Suzuki, Tetsuya; Hasebe, Terumitsu",Minimally invasive therapy & allied technologies : MITAT : official journal of the Society for Minimally Invasive Therapy,https://doi.org/10.1080/13645706.2017.1398174; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29113514/,254

However, the mechanisms by which those patients with DD or HHD are susceptible to HSV are not well elucidated. Here, we experienced two cases with DD, including three episodes of the exacerbation of DD after the development of severe EH. We serially measured serum cytokines before and after the development of EH and DD in these patients. Furthermore, we analyzed the effect of pro-inflammatory cytokines on the mRNA expression of ATP2A2 and ATP2C1, and HSV growth. The timing of EH onset in these patients was coincident with the increase in serum interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α levels. Moreover, the exacerbation of DD occurred in the non-lesional skin of EH after EH remission (mean 24 days, ranging 15-30 days after EH onset). IL-6 and TNF-α enhanced HSV-1 growth, and ATP2A2 and ATP2C1 mRNA levels were downregulated by IL-6 stimulation in cultured differentiated keratinocytes. Increased pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-α lead to development of severe EH lesions via accentuation of HSV growth. IL-6 acts as an exacerbating factor of DD and HHD by downregulating the expression of responsible genes.","Yamamoto, Takenobu; Aoyama, Yumi",The Journal of dermatology,https://doi.org/10.1111/1346-8138.16097; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34355821/,254
123405,Diabetes and COVID 19 in South-East Asia.,2020-06-30,"The transition from a developmentally arrested mature oocyte to a developing embryo requires a series of highly conserved events, collectively known as egg activation. All of these events are preceded by a ubiquitous rise of intracellular calcium, which results from influx of external calcium and/or calcium release from internal storage. In Drosophila, this calcium rise initiates from the pole(s) of the oocyte by influx of external calcium in response to mechanical triggers. It is thought to trigger calcium responsive kinases and/or phosphatases, which in turn alter the oocyte phospho-proteome to initiate downstream events. Recent studies revealed that external calcium enters the activating Drosophila oocyte through Trpm channels, a feature conserved in mouse. The local entry of calcium raises the question of whether Trpm channels are found locally at the poles of the oocyte or are localized around the oocyte periphery, but activated only at the poles. Here, we show that Trpm is distributed all around the oocyte. This requires that it thus be specially regulated at the poles to allow calcium wave initiation. We show that neither egg shape nor local pressure is sufficient to explain this local activation of Trpm channels.","Hu, Qinan; Wolfner, Mariana F",Molecular reproduction and development,https://doi.org/10.1002/mrd.23403; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32735035/,254

Corticosteroids (CS) are known to impair immune response. The objective was to evaluate the risk of developing post-procedural infection within 4 weeks of receiving depot CSI for chronic pain as part of on going quality improvement project. We hypothesised that interventional treatment with depot steroids will not cause a significant increase in clinical infection in the first 4 weeks. METHODS Telephone follow-up was performed as a part of prospective longitudinal audit in a cohort of patients who received interventional treatment for chronic pain at a multidisciplinary pain medicine centre based at a university teaching hospital. Patients who received interventional treatment in the management of chronic pain under a single physician between October 2019 and December 2020 were followed up over telephone as part of on going longitudinal audits. Data was collected on any infection within 4 and 12 weeks of receiving the intervention. Outcomes collected included type of intervention, dose of depot steroids and pain relief obtained at 12 weeks following intervention. RESULTS Over a 15 month period, 261 patients received pain interventions with depot CS. There was no loss to follow-up. Nine patients reported an infection within 4 weeks of receiving depot steroids (9/261, 3.4%). None of the patients tested positive for Covid-19. Eight patients (8/261, 3%) reported an infection between 5 and 12 weeks following the corticosteroid intervention. Although none of the patients tested positive for Covid-19, two patients presented with clinical and radiological features suggestive of Covid-19. Durable analgesia was reported by 51% (133/261) and clinically significant analgesia by 30% (78/261) at 12 weeks following the intervention. Failure rate was 19% (50/261).

The randomized, double-blind Hokusai-VTE trial demonstrated that 60 mg of edoxaban once daily following initial heparin treatment is non-inferior to heparin overlapped with and followed by warfarin for the treatment of VTE, and is associated with significantly fewer bleeding events. OBJECTIVES To assess the efficacy and safety of edoxaban versus warfarin among East Asian patients enrolled in the Hokusai-VTE trial. PATIENTS/METHODS The Hokusai-VTE trial enrolled 8292 patients from 439 centers worldwide, including 1109 patients from Japan, China, Korea, and Taiwan. The primary efficacy and safety outcomes were symptomatic recurrent VTE and clinically relevant bleeding, respectively. RESULTS In the overall East Asian population, the primary efficacy outcome of symptomatic recurrent VTE occurred in 16 of 563 (2.8%) patients in the edoxaban group versus 24 of 538 (4.5%) patients in the warfarin group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.64; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.34-1.19; P = 0.1601). The primary safety outcome of clinically relevant bleeding occurred in 56 of 563 (9.9%) patients in the edoxaban group versus 93 of 538 (17.3%) patients in the warfarin group (HR 0.56; 95% CI 0.40-0.78; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Edoxaban is an effective and safer alternative to warfarin in East Asian patients with acute VTE who require anticoagulant therapy, consistent with overall study findings from the Hokusai-VTE trial.","Nakamura, M; Wang, Y Q; Wang, C; Oh, D; Yin, W-H; Kimura, T; Miyazaki, K; Abe, K; Mercuri, M; Lee, L H; Segers, A; Büller, H",Journal of thrombosis and haemostasis : JTH,https://doi.org/10.1111/jth.13055; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26179767/,254

METHODS A retrospective observational cohort study was conducted by reviewing the medical records of patients who visited or were admitted to a single tertiary care center between January 2011 and June 2019, were treated with antiepileptics, and developed allergic ADRs associated with these drugs. RESULTS In total, 14,230 unique patients received antiepileptics during the study period. Diazepam was the most frequently used antiepileptic drug (74.8 %), followed by phenobarbital (14.3 %), valproic acid (11.4 %), fosphenytoin (10.0 %), and carbamazepine (7.3 %). Although a trend of increasing prevalence of newer generation antiepileptics was noted, most patients are still treated with older generation antiepileptics. Thirty-two (0.22 %) unique patients experienced ADRs associated with antiepileptics, and the antiepileptic drug most frequently associated with ADRs was carbamazepine, at a rate of 1.4 %. Three patients developed Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis, in two of which carbamazepine was implicated. Most patients experienced ADRs associated with aromatic antiepileptics (84.4 %) or older generation antiepileptics (81.3 %). SIGNIFICANCE This is the first study to assess the relationship between ADRs and antiepileptics at a tertiary care center in Japan. Based on our results, most patients were prescribed older generation antiepileptics, and most ADR events were linked to the administration of drugs in this category; thus, identification of patients at risk of developing ADRs is critical in order to prevent such events.","Hikino, Keiko; Abe, Yuichi; Sakashita, Kazumi; Ozeki, Takeshi; Mushiroda, Taisei",Epilepsy research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eplepsyres.2021.106614; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33740697/,254

Recently, a 20-gauge (20G) antegrade-cutting-side-bevelled biopsy needle (ProCore®) was developed for EUS-TA, but data about its diagnostic performance and histological capability are scant. Objectives We assessed the diagnostic performance and histologic retrieval rate of a new 20G antegrade-cutting-side-bevelled biopsy needle compared with a 22G reverse-side-bevelled needle for EUS sampling of solid pancreatic lesions. Patients and methods A retrospective analysis of 238 consecutively collected patients who underwent EUS-TA using a 20G or a 22G ProCore® needle, without rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE), was conducted at two centres.Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value were calculated. Histologic tissue retrieval was evaluated applying a scoring system for each case. Results Sensitivity and specificity were estimated as 98.4-100% in the 20G-, and 94.9-100% in the 22G-needle groups, respectively (p > 0.99). The 20G procured more histologic-grade tissues (92.6% vs 49.5%, p < 0.0001) achieved by a lower number of passes (2.64 vs 3.44, p < 0.0001) compared to the 22G.

Dr. Rudolf Nissen was one of the outstanding surgeons who had served in the Turkish university hospitals. He had created an antireflux procedure which is named after his own name while he was working in our clinic, the Cerrahpaşa Hospital. From a laparoscopic approach, the Nissen fundoplication was the gold standard intervention for the surgical treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Currently, video laparoscopic surgery is evolving quickly with the guidance of new technology. Single-port (SP) laparoscopic transumbilical surgery is one of the newest branches of advanced laparoscopy. DISCUSSION Simple or complex manipulations may be performed with SP laparoscopic transumbilical surgery. The advantages, which are gained from conventional laparoscopy, can be invigorated by an SP laparoscopic approach. The retraction technique of the liver and the optical system were the most important factors, which made the Nissen fundoplication possible via single port. Here, we report that totally laparoscopic transumbilical SP Nissen fundoplication procedure was performed in three patients for sliding hiatal hernia with GERD. CONCLUSION Totally laparoscopic transumbilical SP Nissen fundoplication is a safe and feasible technique for the surgical treatment of GERD.","Hamzaoglu, Ismail; Karahasanoglu, Tayfun; Aytac, Erman; Karatas, Adem; Baca, Bilgi",Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11605-010-1183-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20306152/,254

However, the pathogenesis is unknown. METHODS For the sake of investigating the risk factors and mechanism of PND, we collected the characteristics and neurological scores of patients undergoing cardiac surgery in the Affiliated Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital of Southwest Medical University and Affiliated Hospital of Southwest Medical University from Jan 1, 2016 to Dec 11, 2018. RESULTS We found that age and left atrial thrombus are independent risk factors for PND after cardiac surgery. Furthermore, the serum of 29 patients was collected on the 7th day after cardiac surgery for detecting the expression of lncRNA-MYL2-2 and miR-124-3p. Increased lncRNA-MYL2-2 and decreased miR-124-3p in serum were associated with the decline of patients' cognition. CONCLUSIONS LncRNA-MYL2-2 and miRNA-124-3p may jointly participate in the occurrence and development of PND after cardiac surgery.

OBJECTIVE This scoping review sought to identify studies that describe variation in individual hospitalist performance and to code this data to the domains of the STEEEP framework. METHODS Via a systematic search of peer-reviewed literature that assessed the performance of individual hospitalists in the Medline database, we identified studies that described measurement of individual hospitalist performance. Forty-two studies were included in the final review and coded into one or more domains of the STEEEP framework. RESULTS Studies in the Safe domain focused on transitions of care, both at discharge and within the hospital. Many studies were coded to more than one domain, especially Timely, Effective, and Efficient. Examples include adherence to evidence-based guidelines or Choosing Wisely recommendations. The Patient Centered domain was most frequently coded, but approaches were heterogeneous. No included studies addressed the domain Equitable. CONCLUSIONS Applying the STEEEP framework to the published literature on assessment of individual hospitalist performance revealed strengths and weaknesses. Areas of strength were assessments of transitions of care and application of consensus guidelines. Other areas, such as equity and some components of safe practice, need development. All domains would benefit from more practical approaches. These findings should stimulate future work on feasibility of multidimensional assessment approaches.","Dow, Alan W; Chopski, Benjamin; Cyrus, John W; Paletta-Hobbs, Laura E; Qayyum, Rehan",Journal of hospital medicine,https://doi.org/10.12788/jhm.3445; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32966195/,254

Evidence suggests that SCFAs play a role in the control of infections both through direct action on microorganisms and on host signaling. This review summarizes the main microbicidal effects of SCFAs and discusses studies highlighting the effect of SCFAs in microorganism's virulence and viability. We also describe the SCFA's diverse and complex modes of action on the immune system in face of infections with a specific focus on bacterial and viral respiratory infections. A growing body of evidence suggests that SCFAs protect against lung infections. Finally, we present potential strategies that may be leveraged to exploit the biological properties of SCFAs for increasing effectiveness and optimizing patient benefits.","Machado, Marina Gomes; Sencio, Valentin; Trottein, François",Infection and immunity,https://doi.org/10.1128/iai.00188-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34097474/,254

METHODS We administered an anonymous, voluntary, web-based survey to a convenience sample of trainees worldwide. The survey was distributed by email and social media posts from April 20th to May 11th, 2020. Respondents were asked to estimate the number of patients with COVID-19 they cared for in March and April 2020 (0, 1-30, 31-60, >60). Survey questions addressed (1) safety and access to personal protective equipment (PPE), (2) training and professional development and (3) well-being and burnout. RESULTS Surveys were completed by 1420 trainees (73% residents, 27% fellows), most commonly from the USA (n=670), China (n=150), Saudi Arabia (n=76) and Taiwan (n=75). Trainees who cared for a greater number of patients with COVID-19 were more likely to report limited access to PPE and COVID-19 testing and more likely to test positive for COVID-19. Compared with trainees who did not take care of patients with COVID-19 , those who took care of 1-30 patients (adjusted OR [AOR] 1.80, 95% CI 1.29 to 2.51), 31-60 patients (AOR 3.30, 95% CI 1.86 to 5.88) and >60 patients (AOR 4.03, 95% CI 2.12 to 7.63) were increasingly more likely to report burnout. Trainees were very concerned about the negative effects on training opportunities and professional development irrespective of the number of patients with COVID-19 they cared for. CONCLUSION Exposure to patients with COVID-19 is significantly associated with higher burnout rates in physician trainees.","Cravero, Anne L; Kim, Nicole J; Feld, Lauren D; Berry, Kristin; Rabiee, Atoosa; Bazarbashi, Najdat; Bassin, Sandhya; Lee, Tzu-Hao; Moon, Andrew M; Qi, Xiaolong; Liang, Peter S; Aby, Elizabeth S; Khan, Mohammad Qasim; Young, Kristen J; Patel, Arpan; Wijarnpreecha, Karn; Kobeissy, Abdallah; Hashim, Almoutaz; Houser, Allysia; Ioannou, George N",Postgraduate medical journal,https://doi.org/10.1136/postgradmedj-2020-138789; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33087533/,254

126795,The performance of pooled three anatomic site testing for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae among men who have sex with men and transgender women.,2021-03-12,"INTRODUCTION Laparoscopic surgery is widely used for the treatment of colorectal cancer, but it is often associated with postoperative anastomotic complications. Generally, gastrointestinal anastomosis for colorectal surgery is performed using mechanical anastomosis with a double stapling technique. Using the automatic suture device with bioabsorbable polyglycolic acid (PGA) felt is expected to adequately reinforce staple lines on fragile tissue, helping to prevent anastomotic complications, including leakage. METHODS This study included 17 patients who underwent laparoscopic surgery after a diagnosis of colorectal cancer. The rectosigmoidal colon was resected toward the dentate line with a novel automatic PGA-felt suture device. RESULTS None of the patients had any postoperative bleeding, and none developed grade III or higher postoperative complications based on the Clavien-Dindo classification. When the sigmoid colon, rectosigmoid, or rectum was anastomosed, holding the excess portion of the PGA felt, stapled with the automatic PGA-felt suture device, allowed us to adequately maneuver the part of the colon or rectum to be anastomosed. With this technique, we could easily and safely insert and remove the automatic anastomotic device. When the lower rectum was resected in a planned, two-step operation, the orientation of the PGA felt helped to determine the direction in which the automatic suture device was to be inserted in the second step. Thus, the resected rectum could easily be stapled in a straight line. CONCLUSION The automatic PGA-felt suture device is safe and effective for colorectal resections and anastomoses.","Naito, Masanori; Yamanashi, Takahiro; Nakamura, Takatoshi; Miura, Hirohisa; Tsutsui, Atsuko; Sato, Takeo; Watanabe, Masahiko",Asian journal of endoscopic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1111/ases.12314; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27491782/,254

The principle is that any numerically named sample is divided into two groups, any two samples are not grouped in the same two groups, and any sample can be tested within the detection limit. Therefore, we proposed a specific combination that N samples were divided into M groups. Then N samples were analyzed, which could obtain the mutation results of M mixed groups. If only two groups showed positive (mutant type) signals, the same sample number from two positive signal groups would be the positive sample, and the remaining samples were negative (wild type). If three groups or more exhibited positive results, the same sample number from three positive signal groups would be the positive sample. If some samples remained uncertain, individual samples could be analyzed on a small scale. In the present study, we used the two genotypes of a mutation site (A5301G) to verify whether it was a useful and promising method. The results showed that we could quantitatively detect mutations and demonstrate 100% consistent results against a panel of defined mixtures with the detection limit using pyrosequencing. This method was suitable, sensitive, and reproducible for screening and analyzing low-frequency mutation samples, which could reduce reagent consumption and cost by approximately 70∼80% compared with conventional clinical methods.

METHODS From February 2007 to January 2015, clinical outcomes of thirty four patients with HCC receiving RFA or NAHR were compared, retrospectively. RESULTS There was no difference of patient and tumor characteristic between the two groups that received RFA or NAHR. The 1, 2, and 3-year recurrence rates following RFA were 32.2%, 32.2% and 59.3% respectively, and 6.7%, 33.3% and 33.3% following NAHR respectively (p=0.287). The 1, 2 and 3-year overall survival (OS) rates following RFA were 100%, 88.9% and 76.2% respectively, and 100%, 85.6% and 85.6%, respectively, following NAHR (p=0.869). We did not find a definite statistical difference in recurrence rate and OS rate between the two groups. In the multivariate analysis, number of tumor was an independent prognostic factor for recurrence and albumin was an independent prognostic factor for OS. CONCLUSIONS We recommend non-anatomical hepatic resection rather than intraoperative RFA in small sized HCC, due to a higher recurrence rate in intraoperative RFA. Intraoperative RFA was inferior to non-anatomical hepatic resection in terms of recurrence rate. We need to select the optimal treatment considering liver function and possibility of recurrence.","Yune, Yongwoo; Kim, Seokwhan; Song, Insang; Chun, Kwangsik",Korean journal of hepato-biliary-pancreatic surgery,https://doi.org/10.14701/kjhbps.2015.19.4.173; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26693237/,254

In many cases these patients will require mechanical ventilation; but in others the severity of disease is significantly less and may not need invasive support. High flow nasal cannula (HFNC) is a widely used modality of delivering high concentrations of oxygen and airflow to patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure, but its use in patients with SARS-CoV-2 is poorly described. Concerns with use of HFNC have arisen including aerosolization of viral particles to healthcare workers (HCW) to delaying intubation and potentially worsening of outcomes. However, use of HFNC in other coronavirus pandemics and previous experimental evidence suggest HFNC is low risk and may be effective in select patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. With the significant increase in resource utilization in care of patients with SARS-CoV-2, identification of those that may benefit from HFNC allowing allocation of ventilators to those more critically ill is of significant importance. In this manuscript, we review pertinent literature regarding the use of HFNC in the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and address many concerns regarding its use.","Suffredini, Dante A; Allison, Michael G",Journal of intensive care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1177/0885066620956630; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32912049/,254

In this study, we aim to evaluate lung lesion CT radiological features along with quantitative analysis for the COVID-19 patients ready for discharge. Methods From February 10 to March 10, 2020, 125 COVID-19 patients (age: 16-67 years, 63 males) ready for discharge, with two consecutive negative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and no clinical symptoms for more than 3 days, were included. The pre-discharge CT was performed on all patients 1-3 days after the second negative RT-PCR test, and the follow-up CTs were performed on 44 patients 2-13 days later. The imaging features and quantitative analysis were evaluated on both the pre-discharge and the follow-up CTs, by both radiologists and an artificial intelligence (AI) software. Results On the pre-discharge CT, the most common CT findings included ground-glass opacity (GGO) (99/125, 79.2%) with bilateral mixed distribution, and fibrosis (56/125, 44.8%) with bilateral subpleural distribution. Enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes were also commonly observed (45/125, 36.0%). AI enabled quantitative analysis showed the right lower lobe was mostly involved, and lesions most commonly had CT value of -570 to -470 HU consistent with GGO. Follow-up CT showed GGO decrease in size and density (40/40, 100%) and fibrosis reduction (17/26, 65.4%). Compared with the pre-discharge CT results, quantitative analysis shows the lung lesion volume regressed significantly at follow-up. Conclusions For COVID-19 patients ready for discharge, GGO and fibrosis are the main CT features and they further regress at follow-up.","Du, Siyao; Gao, Si; Huang, Guoliang; Li, Shu; Chong, Wei; Jia, Ziyi; Hou, Gang; Wáng, Yì Xiáng J; Zhang, Lina",Quantitative imaging in medicine and surgery,https://doi.org/10.21037/qims-20-531; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32550139/,254

135109,The swinging pendulum of alcohol policy in the Northern Territory.,2021-01-18,"Common strategies for reducing body weight rely on limiting energy intake and restricting food choices. However, these strategies have often been proven ineffective in achieving long-term and sustainable weight reduction. More recently, mindful eating as an alternative weight management strategy has gained increasing attention, yet systematic reviews on intuitive or mindful eating published so far present contradictory results. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis on randomized controlled trials on weight loss programs based on mindful or intuitive eating. We analyzed results using meta-regressions. We included a total of 10 studies and found a significant weight loss effect of mindful/intuitive eating strategies compared with nonintervention controls (-0.348 kg, 95% CI: -0.591 to -0.105, P = 0.005). However, there was no difference compared with conventional diet programs (P = 0.99). Reduction of BMI (-0.137 kg/m2 , 95% CI: -0.365 to 0.091, P = 0.240) or waist circumference (-0.358 cm, 95% CI: -0.916 to 0.200, P = 0.209) were not statistically significant. Mindful/intuitive eating could be a practical approach to weight control. Limitations of this study include the unbalanced sex, origin, place of residence of the participants, and the short duration of interventions.

Therefore, we aimed to compare the inspiratory effort of three variable-flow NCPAP delivery systems used in preterm infants. DESIGN Cross-over study. PATIENTS/SETTING From June 2015 to August 2016, 20 preterm infants weighing ≤2500 g requiring NCPAP for mild respiratory distress syndrome were enrolled. INTERVENTIONS Each patient was successively supported by three randomly assigned variable-flow NCPAP systems (MedinCNO, Infant Flow and Servo-i) for 20 min while maintaining the same continuous positive airway pressure level as the patient was on before the study period. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Patients' inspiratory effort was estimated by calculating the sum of the difference between maximal inspiratory and baseline electrical activity of the diaphragm (∆EAdi) for 30 consecutive breaths, and after normalising this obtained value for the timing of the 30 breaths. RESULTS Physiological parameters (oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry, respiratory rate, heart beat, transcutaneous partial pressure CO2) and oxygen requirements remained identical between the three NCPAP systems. Although a wide variability in inspiratory effort could be observed, there were no statistically significant differences between the three systems for the sum of ∆EAdi for 30 breaths: CNO, 262 (±119) µV; IF, 352 (±262) µV; and SERVO-i, 286 (±126) µV, and the ∆EAdi reported on the timing of 30 breaths (sum ∆EAdi/s): CNO, 6.1 (±2.3) µV/s; IF, 7.9 (±4.9) µV/s; SERVO-i, 7.6 (±3.6) µV/s.

136046,Effect of nipple shield use on milk removal: a mechanistic study.,2020-09-07,"PURPOSE Enhanced recovery pathways vary amongst institutions but include key components for anesthesiologists, such as haemodynamic optimization, use of short-acting drugs (and monitoring), postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) prophylaxis, protective ventilation, and opioid-sparing multimodal analgesia. METHODS After critical appraisal of the literature, studies were selected with particular attention being paid to meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, and large prospective cohort studies. For each item of the perioperative treatment pathway, available English literature was examined and reviewed. RESULTS Patients should be permitted to drink clear fluids up to 2 h before anaesthesia and surgery. Oral carbohydrate loading should be used routinely. All patients may have an individualized plan for fluid and haemodynamic management that matches the monitoring needs with patient and surgical risk. Minimizing the side effects of anaesthetics and analgesics using short-acting drugs with careful perioperative monitoring should be encouraged. Protective ventilation with alveolar recruitment maneuvers is required. Preventive use of a combination with 2-3 antiemetics in addition to propofol-based total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) is most likely to reduce PONV. While the ideal analgesia regimen remains to be determined, it is clear that a multimodal opioid-sparing analgesic strategy has significant benefits. CONCLUSION Careful evaluation of single patient and planning of the anesthetic care are mandatory to join the ERAS philosophy. Optimal fluid management, use of short-acting drugs, prevention of PONV, protective ventilation, and multimodal analgesia are the cornerstones of the anaesthesia management within ERAS protocols.","Pignot, Géraldine; Brun, Clément; Tourret, Maxime; Lannes, François; Fakhfakh, Sami; Rybikowski, Stanislas; Maubon, Thomas; Picini, Marion; Walz, Jochen",World journal of urology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00345-020-03410-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32839862/,254

Furthermore, inactivation of ORF5a expression in the context of type 1 (pSHE) and type 2 (pAJXM and pAPRRS) full-length PRRSV cDNA clones was lethal for the production of infectious virus, while viable PRRSV could be recovered by expressing ORF5a protein in trans, suggesting that ORF5a protein was essential for virus viability.

We present a pilot prospective, randomized, three-arm clinical trial of 1-year duration that was conducted as a noninferiority trial comparing single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) and flexible single-incision surgery (FSIS) with conventional laparoscopy for elective cholecystectomy (NCT01558414). METHODS Sixty patients between aged 18 and 65 years who were eligible for elective cholecystectomy were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio (n = 20 per group): group A (SILS), single-incision endoscopic surgery using a transumbilical SILS™ device; group B (FSIS), single-incision transumbilical surgery using a flexible endoscope; and group C (CL), conventional laparoscopy. The main outcome variable of the study was ""parietal complications"" (wound infection, bleeding, and ventral hernia). The analysis was by intention to treat and attritions were not replaced. RESULTS Cholecystectomy was performed in 100 % of the cases; perioperative complications occurred in only 1.6 % of the cases, and umbilical surgical wound infection in 3.33 %, with no differences between groups. After a minimum follow-up of 1 year, no differences were noted in the frequency of parietal complications and no ventral hernias occurred. Postoperative pain, hospital length of stay, and downtime from work were similar in all three groups. Surgical time was longer in cases in which a single-incision transumbilical approach was used (58.95 min for SILS and 54.15 for FSIS vs. 49.21 for laparoscopy). CONCLUSIONS Single-incision transumbilical approaches are not inferior for safety or effectiveness compared with conventional laparoscopy.

The aim of the current study was to investigate the use of SBE-ERC with a cap (Cap-SBE-ERC) in patients with surgically altered anatomy referred for ERC. PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients with surgically altered anatomy (hepaticojejunostomy, gastric bypass surgery, and Whipple's surgery) who underwent Cap-SBE-ERC were identified from a prospectively maintained database. Outcomes were diagnostic and procedural success. Patients with a native papilla were compared with those with a biliary-enteric anastomosis. RESULTS Among 56 patients with surgically altered anatomy, high rates of diagnostic and procedural success were observed (78.6 % and 71.4 %, respectively). High diagnostic and procedural success rates of 72.7 % and 65.9 %, respectively, were also observed for patients with Roux-en-Y gastric bypass anatomy with a native papilla (n = 44). CONCLUSION High rates of diagnostic and procedural success were reported for SBE-ERC with the use of a cap, including a large subgroup of patients with Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and a native papilla.","Trindade, Arvind J; Mella, Jose M; Slattery, Eoin; Cohen, Jonah; Dickstein, Jacob; Garud, Sagar S; Chuttani, Ram; Pleskow, Douglas K; Sawhney, Mandeep S; Berzin, Tyler M",Endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0034-1391077; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25521569/,254

Classical compounds such as CTC-96 and auranofin are discussed in depth, as pillars for future metallodrug development. From the recent literature, both cell-based results and biophysical assays against potential viral biomolecule targets are summarized here. The comprehension of the biomolecular targets and their interactions with coordination compounds are emphasized as fundamental strategies that will foment further development of metal-based antivirals. We also discuss other possible and unexplored methods for unveiling metallodrug interactions with biomolecules related to viral replication and highlight the specific challenges involved in the development of antiviral metallodrugs.","de Paiva, Raphael E F; Marçal Neto, Antônio; Santos, Igor A; Jardim, Ana C G; Corbi, Pedro P; Bergamini, Fernando R G",Dalton transactions,https://doi.org/10.1039/d0dt02478c; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33030464/,254

143225,The Toll of Lockdown Against COVID-19 on Diabetes Outpatient Care. Analysis from an outbreak area in North-East Italy.,2020-10-30,"As a class of alternative flame retardants, ""novel"" brominated flame retardants (NBFRs) have been widely used in clothing, textiles, electronics, building materials, and plastics and are frequently found in environmental samples. Although the use and discharge of NBFRs are increasing all over the world, little information is available about their fates and removal in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). This study investigated the occurrence and behavior of 2,4,6-tribromophenyl allyl ether (ATE), 2,3-dibromopropyl tribromophenyl ether (DPTE), tetrabromo-o-chlorotoluene (TBCT), pentabromobenzyl acrylate (PBBA), 1,2-bis(2,4,6-tribromophenoxy) ethane (BTBPE), bis(2-ethylhexyl)-3,4,5,6-tetrabromo-phthalate (TBPH), and decabromodiphenyl ethane (DBDPE) in a municipal WWTP in Beijing, China. Four of the NBFRs (ATE, BTBPE, TBPH, and DBDPE) were detected in all wastewater and biosolid samples. The dominant compound in both wastewater and biosolid samples was DBDPE, with concentrations in the ranges of 6.4-18 ng/L and 83-288 ng/g dry weight (dw), respectively. A mass flow analysis indicated that the overall removal efficiencies were 31±18% for ATE, 97±1.5% for DPTE, 79±11% for BTBPE, 87±5.3% for TBPH, and 93±3.3% for DBDPE, but the removal efficiency in aqueous phase only ranged from -43 (ATE) to 57% (DBDPE). The low and negative removal efficiencies of ATE were possibly due to the transformation of DPTE during the anaerobic treatment processes. Under the aerobic conditions, BTBPE, TBPH and DBDPE underwent a very slow biodegradation. A total of 68-91% of the initial mass loadings of ATE, BTBPE, TBPH and DBDPE were found in the biosolid samples, suggesting that the four NBFRs were removed mainly via sorption in the WWTP.The biosolid was a huge reservoir of target NBFRs, and effective removal of NBFRs during treatment in the WWTP is critical.","Wang, Hongping; Liu, Songqing; Zhang, Cunxu; Wan, Yi; Chang, Hong",Water research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2020.116298; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32818736/,254

We analyzed the yield of signet-ring cell carcinoma (SRCC) during surveillance gastroscopy in CDH1 mutation carriers. METHODS : A retrospective analysis on surveillance gastroscopies in CDH1 mutation carriers was performed. The yield of SRCC in both targeted and random biopsies was studied. Endoscopic (biopsy) results were compared with the histopathologic outcomes in gastrectomy specimens. RESULTS : 42 CDH1 mutation carriers (18 men; mean age 43, range 20-82 years) underwent 96 surveillance gastroscopies. SRCC lesions were identified on surveillance gastroscopy in 21 patients (50 %), by either targeted biopsies only (n = 11), random biopsies only (n = 3), or both random and targeted biopsies (n = 7). SRCC was detected in 41 /377 targeted biopsies (11 %), whereas random biopsies revealed SRCC in 14/1563 biopsies (0.9 %). At least one SRCC lesion was found in 26 of 30 gastrectomy specimens. In 18 of these 26 specimens (69 %), SRCC had been identified by endoscopic biopsies. Missed lesions were all small superficial SRCC foci, mainly in the body of the stomach. CONCLUSION : In our cohort of CDH1 mutation carriers, SRCC lesions were identified by an extensive endoscopic surveillance protocol in 69 % of SRCC-positive patients who underwent a gastric resection. The low number of SRCC detected through random sampling demands a critical reappraisal of random biopsy sampling in the IGCLC guideline.","van Dieren, Jolanda M; Kodach, Liudmila L; den Hartog, Peggy; van der Kolk, Lizet E; Sikorska, Karolina; van Velthuysen, Marie-Louise F; van Sandick, Johanna W; Koemans, Willem J; Snaebjornsson, Petur; Cats, Annemieke",Endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1157-8678; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408363/,254

145622,Effect of deinstitutionalisation on quality of life for adults with intellectual disabilities: a systematic review.,2019,"OBJECTIVE Treatment of bilateral vertebral artery dissecting aneurysms presenting with subarachnoid hemorrhage remains challenging as bilateral deconstructive procedures may not be feasible. In this case series, we describe our approach to their management and review the pertinent literature. METHOD A retrospective review of our prospectively collected database on aneurysms was performed to identify all patients with acute subarachnoid hemorrhage in the setting of bilateral intradural vertebral artery dissections (VAD) encompassing a period from January 2000 and March 2012. RESULT Four patients (M/F = 2/2; mean age, 51.5 years) were identified. In two cases the site of rupture could be identified by angiographic and cross-sectional features; in these patients deconstructive treatment (proximal obliteration or trapping) of the ruptured site and reconstructive treatment of the unruptured site (using stents and coils) were performed. In the patients in whom the site of hemorrhage could not be determined, bilateral reconstructive treatment was performed. No treatment-related complications were encountered. Modified Rankin scale scores were 0-1 at discharge, and on follow-up (mean 63 months), no recurrence, in-stent thrombosis or new neurological deficits were encountered. CONCLUSION We believe that single-stage treatment in patients with bilateral VAD is indicated: If the site of hemorrhage can be determined, we prefer deconstructive treatment on the affected site and reconstructive treatment on the non-affected site to prevent increased hemodynamic stress on the unruptured but diseased wall. If the site of dissection cannot be determined, we prefer bilateral reconstructive treatment to avoid increasing hemodynamic stress on the potentially untreated acute hemorrhagic dissection.","Zhao, Wen-Yuan; Zhao, Kai-Jun; Huang, Qing-Hai; Xu, Yi; Hong, Bo; Liu, Jian-Min","Interventional neuroradiology : journal of peritherapeutic neuroradiology, surgical procedures and related neurosciences",https://doi.org/10.1177/1591019915617325; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26686384/,254

Cellphilm method capitalises on these trends by inviting participants to use mobile devices to create short videos about health topics. This paper presents the quilted cellphilm method, which supports the participation of stigmatised populations to engage in research. We present the method with reference to the Celling Sex project, which worked with young women who have transactional sex experience. Four key steps in our unique model are discussed: (a) individual cellphilm-making; (b) participatory analysis; (c) creating a composite video; (d) publicly screening the work. We consider how working individually with participants in the cellphilm-making process built trust. We unpack how offering participants opportunities to engage in either group or one-on-one activities promoted participation in collaborative analysis. We outline how creating a composite video of the cellphilms and organising screenings facilitated knowledge translation and exchange. Overall, the quilted cellphilm method created a supportive community for vulnerable participants to generate products that challenged social stigma. Increased reliance on mobile media, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, makes the quilted cellphilm method an opportune, exciting and accessible approach for participatory public health research.","MacEntee, Katie; Kendrick, Caterina; Flicker, Sarah",Global public health,https://doi.org/10.1080/17441692.2021.1928262; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34044745/,254

Although genetic and biochemical studies have elucidated many aspects of T4 late gene transcription, no precise structure of the transcription machinery in the process is available. Here, we report the cryo-EM structures of a gp55-dependent RNAP-promoter open complex and an intact gp45-dependent transcription activation complex. The structures reveal the interactions between gp55 and the promoter DNA that mediate the recognition of T4 late promoters. In addition to the σR2 homology domain, gp55 has a helix-loop-helix motif that chaperons the template-strand single-stranded DNA of the transcription bubble. Gp33 contacts both RNAP and the upstream double-stranded DNA. Gp45 encircles the DNA and tethers RNAP to it, supporting the idea that gp45 switches the promoter search from three-dimensional diffusion mode to one-dimensional scanning mode.","Shi, Jing; Wen, Aijia; Jin, Sha; Gao, Bo; Huang, Yang; Feng, Yu",Nature communications,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-21392-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33602900/,254

Teleneurology is an effective tool for the remote evaluation of patients but its adoption for frontotemporal lobar dementia (FTD) is in a preliminary stage. OBJECTIVE We evaluated multidisciplinary assessment of patients with FTD using telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS All patients received a diagnosis of FTD during 2018-2019 according to international criteria. A structured questionnaire and Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR)-FTD were used by the neurologist with patients and/or caregivers. Index symptoms of COVID-19 infection were searched. RESULTS Twenty-eight clinical interviews were completed with caregivers and four with both patients/caregivers. Most patients and caregivers were satisfied with the neurological interview and expressed their willingness to continue to be included in remote evaluation programs (90%). Fifty percent of patients experienced significant worsening of clinical picture and quality of life since the start of social distancing. The CDR-FTD scale revealed a significant worsening of behavior (p = 0.01) and language functions (p = 0.009), compared to the last in-person evaluation at the center. One patient presented index symptoms of COVID-19 infection and was confirmed to be positive for COVID-19 with pharyngeal swab. CONCLUSION The study was conducted in Italy, one of the countries hit particularly hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, with interruption of all non-emergency medical services.

The minimal clinically important difference (MCID) is the smallest change in an outcome sufficiently important to influence management and is crucial for designing and interpreting comparative effectiveness trials. Our objective was to generate MCID estimates for three postoperative recovery metrics. METHODS Prospectively collected data on two cohorts of 281 and 130 adult patients undergoing abdominal surgery were analyzed. At each of three visits, patients had completed the 36-Item Short Form Survey from the RAND Medical Outcomes Study (SF-36) and either Community Healthy Activities Model Program for Seniors (CHAMPS) or the 6-minute walk test (6MWT). The MCID was estimated with an anchor-based approach with random effects linear regression models. Patients' rating of their own health was used to predict SF-36 domain, CHAMPS, and 6MWT scores. Results are reported as MCID (95% confidence interval). RESULTS On the SF-36 domains analyzed, MCIDs were consistently smaller for patients rating their health as ""excellent"" or ""very good"" (from 8 [6-9] to 15 [12-18]) compared with those for patients rating their health as ""fair"" or ""poor"" (from 15 [12-19] to 32 [28-36]). For CHAMPS, the MCID was 8 kcal/kg/week (7-9), and for the 6MWT, 14 meters (9-18). CONCLUSION Plausible MCIDs and ranges around each estimate are provided. These values should be considered when planning and interpreting abdominal surgery clinical trials where patient-reported outcomes are assessed.","Antonescu, Ioana; Scott, Susan; Tran, Tung T; Mayo, Nancy E; Feldman, Liane S",Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.surg.2014.03.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24947644/,254
151360,Factors influencing general practitioners decisions to refer Paediatric patients to the emergency department: a systematic review and narrative synthesis.,2020-10-16,"OBJECTIVE To provide a consistently updated overview of the comparative effectiveness of treatments for Achilles tendinopathy. DESIGN Living systematic review and network meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES Multiple databases including grey literature sources were searched up to February 2019. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA Randomised controlled trials examining the effectiveness of any treatment in patients with both insertional and/or midportion Achilles tendinopathy. We excluded trials with 10 or fewer participants per treatment arm or trials investigating tendon ruptures. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Reviewers independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. We used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation to appraise the certainty of evidence. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE The validated patient-reported Victorian Institute of Sport Assessment-Achilles questionnaire. RESULTS 29 trials investigating 42 different treatments were included. 22 trials (76%) were at high risk of bias and 7 (24%) had some concerns. Most trials included patients with midportion tendinopathy (86%). Any treatment class seemed superior to wait-and-see for midportion Achilles tendinopathy at 3 months (very low to low certainty of evidence). At 12 months, exercise therapy, exercise+injection therapy and exercise+night splint therapy were all comparable with injection therapy for midportion tendinopathy (very low to low certainty). No network meta-analysis could be performed for insertional Achilles tendinopathy. SUMMARY/CONCLUSION In our living network meta-analysis no trials were at low risk of bias and there was large uncertainty in the comparative estimates. For midportion Achilles tendinopathy, wait-and-see is not recommended as all active treatments seemed superior at 3-month follow-up. There seems to be no clinically relevant difference in effectiveness between different active treatments at either 3-month or 12-month follow-up. As exercise therapy is easy to prescribe, can be of low cost and has few harms, clinicians could consider starting treatment with a calf-muscle exercise programme.

152467,Risk and protective factors of dementia among adults with post-traumatic stress disorder: a systematic review protocol.,2020-06-03,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most familiar multifactorial and complex neurodegenerative disorders characterized by loss of cholinergic neurons in the brain. The various attempts for drug development to treat AD have been hampered by largely unsuccessful clinical trials in the last two decades. Developing a new drug from scratch takes enormous amounts of time, effort and money, mainly due to several barriers in the therapeutic drug development process. Drug repurposing strategy resuscitates this slow drug discovery process by finding new uses and clinical indications for existing drugs. This study is focused on the cholinergic hypothesis, a well-established target of the clinically available drugs in the market for the treatment of AD. The computational virtual screening (VS) led to the identification of thiazolidinedione (TZD, antidiabetic) and aminoquinoline (antimalarial) class of drugs as acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors. Intriguingly, rosiglitazone (RGZ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) were found to be mild-to-moderate inhibitors of hAChE (human acetylcholinesterase) in our enzyme inhibition studies which are complementary to our computational studies. On the basis of our computational and experimental studies, it can be suggested that the beneficial effect of RGZ and HCQ in AD patients reported in the literature may partly be due to their AChE inhibitory property. The VS also led to the identification of antifungal drugs miconazole and oxiconazole as potential AChE inhibitors. The molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of the potential hits belonging to TZD, aminoquinoline and azoles class were also carried out. The MD simulations studies revealed detailed computational insights related to molecular interactions and protein-ligand stability for selected hits. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

153018,[Creation of an inter-sector COVID-19 care unit for psychiatric patients].,2020,"BACKGROUND Food systems affect nutritional and other health outcomes. Recent literature from India has described policy aspects addressing nutritional implications of specific foods (eg, fruits, vegetables, and trans-fats), and identified opportunities to tackle the double burden of malnutrition. This paper attempts to deepen the understanding on how health concerns and the role of the health sector are addressed across food systems policies in India. METHODS This qualitative study used two approaches; namely (i) the framework method and (ii) manifest content analysis, to investigate national-level policy documents from relevant sectors (ie, food security, agriculture, biodiversity, food processing, trade, and waste management, besides health and nutrition). The documents were selected purposively. The textual data were coded and compared, from which themes were identified, described, and interpreted. Additionally, mentions of various health concerns and of the health ministry in the included documents were recorded and collated. RESULTS A total of 35 policy documents were included in the analysis. A variety of health concerns spanning nutritional, communicable and non-communicable diseases (NCDs) were mentioned. Undernutrition received specific attention even beyond nutrition policies. Only few policies mentioned NCDs, infectious diseases, and injuries. Governing and advisory bodies were instituted by 17 of the analysed policies (eg, food safety, agriculture, and food processing), and often included representation from the health ministry (9 of the 17 identified inter-ministerial bodies). CONCLUSION We found some evidence of concern for health, and inclusion of health ministry in food policy documents in India. The ongoing and planned intersectoral coordination to tackle undernutrition could inform actions to address other relevant but currently underappreciated concerns such as NCDs. Our study demonstrated a method for analysis of health consideration and intersectoral coordination in food policy documents, which could be applied to studies in other settings and policy domains.","Pradyumna, Adithya; Mishra, Arima; Utzinger, Jürg; Winkler, Mirko S",International journal of health policy and management,https://doi.org/10.34172/ijhpm.2021.18; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33904697/,254
153044,Mindfulness-based interventions for children and adolescents across all settings: a scoping review protocol.,2020-12-07,"Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) is associated with cardiovascular risk. The longitudinal change in EAT volume (EATv) and density (EATd), and potential modulators of these parameters, has not been described. We prospectively recruited 90 patients with non-obstructive coronary atherosclerosis on baseline computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA) performed for suspected coronary artery disease to undergo a repeat research CTCA. EATv in millilitres (mL) and EATd in Hounsfield units (HU) were analysed and multivariable regression analysis controlling for traditional cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF) performed to assess for any predictors of change. Secondary analysis was performed based on statin therapy. The median duration between CTCA was 4.3years. Mean EATv increased at follow-up (72 ± 33 mL to 89 ± 43 mL, p < 0.001) and mean EATd decreased (baseline -76 ± 6 HU vs. -86 ± 5 HU, p < 0.001). There were no associations between baseline variables of body mass index, age, sex, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes or smoking on change in EATv or EATd. No difference in baseline, follow-up or delta EATv or EATd was seen in patients with (60%) or without baseline statin therapy. In this select group of patients, EATv consistently increased and EATd consistently decreased at long-term follow-up and these changes were independent of CVRF, age and statin use. Together with the knowledge of strong associations between EAT and cardiac disease, these findings may suggest that EAT is an independent parameter rather than a surrogate for cardiovascular risk.","Nerlekar, Nitesh; Thakur, Udit; Lin, Andrew; Koh, Ji Quan Samuel; Potter, Elizabeth; Liu, David; Muthalaly, Rahul G; Rashid, Hashrul N; Cameron, James D; Dey, Damini; Wong, Dennis T L",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-63135-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346001/,254

On March 24, 2020, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) suspended all polio supplementary immunization activities and recommended the continuation of polio surveillance (2). In April 2020, GPEI shared revised polio surveillance guidelines in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, which focused on reducing the risk for transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, to health care workers and communities by modifying activities that required person-to-person contact, improving hand hygiene and personal protective equipment use practices, and overcoming challenges related to movement restrictions, while continuing essential polio surveillance functions (3). GPEI assessed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on polio surveillance by comparing data from January to September 2019 to the same period in 2020. Globally, the number of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases reported declined 33% and the mean number of days between the second stool collected and receipt by the laboratory increased by 70%. Continued analysis of AFP case reporting and stool collection is critical to ensure timely detection and response to interruptions of polio surveillance.","Zomahoun, Delayo J; Burman, Ashley L; Snider, Cynthia J; Chauvin, Claire; Gardner, Tracie; Lickness, Jacquelyn S; Ahmed, Jamal A; Diop, Ousmane; Gerber, Sue; Anand, Abhijeet",MMWR.

153854,Effectiveness of alternative listening devices to conventional hearing aids for adults with hearing loss: a systematic review protocol.,2016,"BACKGROUND Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has become an epidemic health problem worldwide. Compared to Western countries, in Asia, T2DM occurs in patients with a lower body mass index (BMI) due to central obesity and decreased pancreatic β-cell function. The efficacy of laparoscopic mini-gastric bypass (LMGB) in obese patients with T2DM has been proven by numerous studies. Treatment outcomes of LMGB for non-obese T2DM patients are also estimated to be excellent. The aim of the present pilot study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of LMBG in non-obese T2DM patients (BMI 25-30 kg/m(2)). METHODS Ten consecutive patients underwent LMGB at our hospital from August 2009 to October 2009. Preoperative data including glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and 2 h postprandial glucose (2-h PPG) were compared with data collected at 1, 3, and 6 postoperative months. RESULTS All procedures were completed laparoscopically. Mean age of the patients was 46.9 years, mean BMI was 27.2 kg/m(2), mean operative time was 150.5 min, and mean postoperative hospital stay was 5.3 days. Neither mortality nor major complications occurred. Mean preoperative glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2-h PPG, and C-peptide level were 9.7%, 222 mg/dl, 343 mg/dl, and 2.78 ng/ml, respectively. At the sixth postoperative month, HbA1c, FPG, 2-h PPG, and C-peptide level measured 6.7%, 144 mg/dl, 203 mg/dl, and 2.18 ng/ml. CONCLUSIONS This preliminary study demonstrated the resolution of hyperglycemia in 70% of non-obese T2DM patients (BMI 25-30 kg/m(2)). Although long-term follow-up data are required, early operative outcomes were satisfactory in terms of glycemic control and safety of the procedure.","Kim, Zisun; Hur, Kyung Yul",World journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00268-010-0909-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21165621/,254

Objectives We aimed to estimate the effectiveness of facemask use alone or along with hand hygiene in community settings in reducing the transmission of viral respiratory illness. Methods We searched PubMed and Embase for randomized controlled trials on facemask use in community settings to prevent viral respiratory illnesses published up to April 25, 2020. Two independent reviewers were involved in synthesis of data. Data extraction and risk-of-bias assessment were done in a standard format from the selected studies. Outcome data for clinically diagnosed or self-reported influenza-like illness (ILI) was recorded from individual studies. Pooled effect size was estimated by random-effects model for ""facemask only versus control"" and ""facemask plus hand hygiene versus control."" Results Of the 465 studies from PubMed and 437 studies from Embase identified from our search, 9 studies were included in qualitative synthesis and 8 studies in quantitative synthesis. Risk of bias was assessed as low (n = 4), medium (n = 3), or high (n = 1) risk. Interventions included using a triple-layered mask alone or in combination with hand hygiene. Publication bias was not significant. There was no significant reduction in ILI either with facemask alone (n = 5, pooled effect size: -0.17; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.43-0.10; P = 0.23; I2 = 10.9%) or facemask with handwash (n = 6, pooled effect size: (n=6, pooled effect size: -0.09; 95% CI: -0.58 to 0.40; P = 0.71, I2 = 69.4%). Conclusion : Existing data pooled from randomized controlled trials do not reveal a reduction in occurrence of ILI with the use of facemask alone in community settings.","Aggarwal, Nishant; Dwarakanathan, Vignesh; Gautam, Nitesh; Ray, Animesh",Indian journal of public health,https://doi.org/10.4103/ijph.ijph_470_20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32496254/,254

DATA SOURCES We conducted a systematic review of studies published in English, Spanish, French, or German by June 2017 in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials.gov. METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION We reviewed 8,755 unique citations and included 53 studies that contained 50 or greater women using a specific fertility awareness-based method to avoid pregnancy, calculated life table pregnancy probabilities or Pearl rates, and prospectively measured pregnancy intentions and outcomes. We systematically evaluated study quality. TABULATION, INTEGRATION, AND RESULTS Of 53 included studies, we ranked 0 high quality, 21 moderate quality, and 32 low quality for our question of interest. Among moderate-quality studies, first-year typical use pregnancy rates or probabilities per 100 woman-years varied widely: 11.2-14.1 for the Standard Days Method, 13.7 for the TwoDay Method, 10.5-33.6 for the Billings Ovulation Method, 4-18.5 for the Marquette Mucus-only Method, 9.0-9.8 for basal body temperature methods, 13.2 for single-check symptothermal methods, 11.2-33.0 for Thyma double-check symptothermal methods, 1.8 for Sensiplan, 25.6 for Persona, 2-6.8 for the Marquette Monitor-only Method, and 6-7 for the Marquette Monitor and Mucus Method. First-year perfect use pregnancy rates or probabilities among moderate-quality studies were 4.8 for the Standard Days Method, 3.5 for the TwoDay Method, 1.1-3.4 for the Billings Ovulation Method, 2.7 for the Marquette Mucus Method, 0.4 for Sensiplan, 12.1 for Persona, and 0 for the Marquette Monitor. CONCLUSION Studies on the effectiveness of each fertility awareness-based method are few and of low to moderate quality. Pregnancy rates or probabilities varied widely across different fertility awareness-based methods (and in some cases, within method types), even after excluding low-quality studies. Variability across populations studied precludes comparisons across methods.","Peragallo Urrutia, Rachel; Polis, Chelsea B; Jensen, Elizabeth T; Greene, Margaret E; Kennedy, Emily; Stanford, Joseph B",Obstetrics and gynecology,https://doi.org/10.1097/aog.0000000000002784; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30095777/,254

Glycoprotein N (Gn) is one of the envelope proteins on the virus surface and is a major antigenic component. Despite its importance for virus entry and fusion, the molecular features of the phleboviruse Gn were unknown. Here, we present the crystal structures of the Gn head domain from both SFTSV and RVFV, which display a similar compact triangular shape overall, while the three subdomains (domains I, II, and III) making up the Gn head display different arrangements. Ten cysteines in the Gn stem region are conserved among phleboviruses, four of which are responsible for Gn dimerization, as revealed in this study, and they are highly conserved for all members in Bunyaviridae Therefore, we propose an anchoring mode on the viral surface. The complex structure of the SFTSV Gn head and human neutralizing antibody MAb 4-5 reveals that helices α6 in subdomain III is the key component for neutralization. Importantly, the structure indicates that domain III is an ideal region recognized by specific neutralizing antibodies, while domain II is probably recognized by broadly neutralizing antibodies. Collectively, Gn is a desirable vaccine target, and our data provide a molecular basis for the rational design of vaccines against the diseases caused by phleboviruses and a model for bunyavirus Gn embedding on the viral surface.","Wu, Yan; Zhu, Yaohua; Gao, Feng; Jiao, Yongjun; Oladejo, Babayemi O; Chai, Yan; Bi, Yuhai; Lu, Shan; Dong, Mengqiu; Zhang, Chang; Huang, Guangmei; Wong, Gary; Li, Na; Zhang, Yanfang; Li, Yan; Feng, Wen-Hai; Shi, Yi; Liang, Mifang; Zhang, Rongguang; Qi, Jianxun; Gao, George F",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1705176114; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28827346/,254

RECENT FINDINGS Extended-spectrum and carbapenemase producing Enterobacterales and multidrug and extensive drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii have increased worldwide. Sequence type (ST)131 Escherichia coli, ST258, ST11, ST10, ST147 and ST307 Klebsiella pneumoniae, ST111, ST175, ST235 and ST244 P. aeruginosa HiRCs are responsible for this increase in the ICUs, and some of them are implicated in the emergence of resistance mechanisms affecting new antimicrobials. A similar situation can be found with European clonal complex 1 and clonal complex 2 of A. baumannii. The high use of antimicrobials during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in ICUs, might have a negative influence in future trends of antimicrobial resistance. SUMMARY The increase of antimicrobial resistance in ICUs is mainly due to the spread of HiRCs and is exemplified with the ESKAPE Gram-negative microorganisms. The COVID-19 pandemic might have a negative impact in the increase of antimicrobial resistance and should be monitored through specific surveillance studies in ICUs.","Cantón, Rafael; Gijón, Desirèe; Ruiz-Garbajosa, Patricia",Current opinion in critical care,https://doi.org/10.1097/mcc.0000000000000755; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32739970/,254

The assay consists of a first round RT-PCR and a subsequent nested PCR amplification. It has unique features such as the use of a premix system in which all reagents are lyophilized in reaction tubes and the inclusion of control RNA in each reaction to monitor false negative results. In addition, an automatic tissue homogenizer and a RNA extraction system are used concurrently for assay standardization and increasing throughput. The assay using the kit proved specific for JEV with no amplification of other JEV-related flaviviruses. The detection limits were approximately 0.1 PFU/ml and 1 PFU/ml for JEV genotypes 1 and 3, respectively. The assay protocol has been validated in large-scale field trials in South Korea during the 2008-2009 surveillance seasons.

The generalization of RCT findings are jeopardized by the lack of participation of at-risk groups such as African Americans, with long-recognized disproportional representation. Distinct factors that deter participation in RCTs include distrust, access, recruitment strategies, perceptions of research, and socioeconomic factors. While strategies have been implemented to improve external validity with greater participation among all segments of the population in RCTs, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may exacerbate disparities in RCT participation with the potential impact of delaying treatment development and vaccine interventions that are applicable and generalizable.

Clinical presentation of COVID-19, however, can be difficult to distinguish from other respiratory viral infections. Thus, identifying clinical features that are strongly associated with COVID-19 in comparison to other respiratory viruses can aid risk stratification and testing prioritization especially in situations where resources for virological testing and resources for isolation facilities are limited. In our retrospective cohort study comparing clinical presentation of COVID-19 and other respiratory viral infections, we found that anosmia and dysgeusia were symptoms independently associated with COVID-19 and can be important differentiating symptoms in patients presenting with acute respiratory illness. On the other hand, laboratory abnormalities and radiological findings were not statistically different between the 2 groups. In comparing outcomes, patients with COVID-19 were more likely to need high dependency or intensive care unit care, and had longer median length of stay. With our findings, we emphasize that epidemiological risk factors and clinical symptoms are more useful than laboratory and radiological abnormalities in differentiating COVID-19 from other respiratory viral infections.

Three-dimensional (3D) printing enables training or simulation surgery on a real-size replica of deformed spine, which is difficult to perform in the usual cadaver or surrogate plastic models. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the educational effect of using a real-size 3D-printed spine model for training beginners of the free-hand pedicle screw instrumentation technique. We asked whether the use of a 3D spine model can improve (1) screw instrumentation accuracy and (2) length of procedure. METHODS Twenty life-size 3D-printed lumbar spine models were made from 10 volunteers (two models for each volunteer). Two novice surgeons who had no experience of free-hand pedicle screw instrumentation technique were instructed by an experienced surgeon, and each surgeon inserted 10 pedicle screws for each lumbar spine model. Computed tomography scans of the spine models were obtained to evaluate screw instrumentation accuracy. The length of time in completing the procedure was recorded. The results of the latter 10 spine models were compared with those of the former 10 models to evaluate learning effect. RESULTS A total of 37/200 screws (18.5%) perforated the pedicle cortex with a mean of 1.7 mm (range, 1.2-3.3 mm). However, the latter half of the models had significantly less violation than the former half (10/100 vs. 27/100, p < 0.001). The mean length of time to complete 10 pedicle screw instrumentations in a spine model was 42.8 ± 5.3 min for the former 10 spine models and 35.6 ± 2.9 min for the latter 10 spine models. The latter 10 spine models had significantly less time than the former 10 models (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION A life-size 3D-printed spine model can be an excellent tool for training beginners of the free-hand pedicle screw instrumentation.","Park, Hyun Jin; Wang, Chenyu; Choi, Kyung Ho; Kim, Hyong Nyun",Journal of orthopaedic surgery and research,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13018-018-0788-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29661210/,254

For future studies, special attention should be paid to lipid-mediated crosstalk among cancer cells, their neighboring stromal cells, and immune cells, plus how these multi-level communications determine anti-tumor immunity and bring novel immunotherapeutic opportunities.","Ma, Yuting; Zhang, Shuqing; Jin, Ziqi; Shi, Minxin",Pharmacological research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phrs.2020.105131; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32810628/,254
162348,Initial Presentation of Children with Type 2 Diabetes during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND We observed a substantial increase in the incidence of pulmonary embolism (PE) after total joint arthroplasty (TJA) when multidetector computerized tomography (MDCT) replaced ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scans as the diagnostic modality of choice. We questioned whether this resulted from the detection of clinically unimportant PE with the more sensitive MDCT and in 2007 instituted a hypoxia protocol to enhance the detection of PE. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES We determined whether this new hypoxia protocol increased the specificity of our workups for suspected clinically important PE in the immediate postoperative period without affecting patient morbidity and mortality. PATIENTS AND METHODS We compared the frequency of MDCT, V/Q scan and total investigations, incidence of PE, and overall mortality rates in the 3 years prior (January 2003 to December 2006) and 2 years after (January 2007 to November 2009) the implementation of the algorithm. RESULTS After instituting the protocol, we observed a trend toward a decrease in the number of patients worked up for PE (4.6 to 4.0 per 100 TJAs, 13.5% decrease). At the same time, there was an increase in the percent of positive findings of PE per workup for PE (23-33 positive PEs per 100 patients, 40.5% increase). All-cause mortality rates decreased for the 30-day period (3.1 to 1.4 per 1000 TJAs, 53.5% decrease) and the 90-day period (5.0 to 2.6 per 1000 TJAs, 48.3% decrease). CONCLUSIONS With the implementation of this algorithm, the specificity of our management of postoperative hypoxia and suspected clinically important PE improved without affecting patient morbidity or mortality.","Winters, Brian S; Solarz, Mark; Jacovides, Christina L; Purtill, James J; Rothman, Richard H; Parvizi, Javad",Clinical orthopaedics and related research,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11999-011-2109-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22002824/,254

163267,Self-testing as a method of reducing COVID-19 infections,2021,"As the COVID-19 pandemic evolves, reliable prediction plays an important role in policymaking. The classical infectious disease model SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered) is a compact yet simplistic temporal model. The data-driven machine learning models such as RNN (recurrent neural networks) can suffer in case of limited time series data such as COVID-19. In this paper, we combine SEIR and RNN on a graph structure to develop a hybrid spatio-temporal model to achieve both accuracy and efficiency in training and forecasting. We introduce two features on the graph structure: node feature (local temporal infection trend) and edge feature (geographic neighbor effect). For node feature, we derive a discrete recursion (called I-equation) from SEIR so that gradient descend method applies readily to its optimization. For edge feature, we design an RNN model to capture the neighboring effect and regularize the landscape of loss function so that local minima are effective and robust for prediction. The resulting hybrid model (called IeRNN) improves the prediction accuracy on state-level COVID-19 new case data from the US, out-performing standard temporal models (RNN, SEIR, and ARIMA) in 1-day and 7-day ahead forecasting. Our model accommodates various degrees of reopening and provides potential outcomes for policymakers.","Zheng, Y. L.; Li, Z. J.; Xin, J.; Zhou, G.

Khalid Ali has been living healthy until two years ago when he started experiencing pains in his lower extremities accompanied by numbness. He was treated, and everything went back to normal until soon when the case came back after the administration of the Pfizer vaccine as a preventive measure for COVID-19 disease. The consequence of the administration of the Pfizer vaccine resulted in severe pain and weaknesses in his legs and severe headache on the second day, which resulted in him being put on an ICU after 48 hours since he was almost paralyzed. A series of tests were conducted on him, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), hematology, and biochemistry which involved Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) protein test. MRI findings were significant since they indicated acute inflammation on the spine observed on the dorsal spinal cord with contrast and lumbosacral spinal cord. All the hematology tests turned out to be expected. Biochemistry conducted tests were similarly standard except for CSF protein which was highly abnormal. The combination of the high abnormal CSF protein test and acute inflammation of the spine observed from the MRI findings were confirmed evidence of acute transverse myelitis as a result of the administration of the Pfizer vaccine.","Alshararni, A.",International Journal of Research in Pharmaceutical Sciences,https://doi.org/10.26452/ijrps.v12i3.4818,254

While this arrangement has become standard practice, it often requires the use of an external tool or interface for submission and does not automatically check its correctness. That in turn leads to increased workload and makes it difficult to deal with potential plagiarism. In this work we present TermAdventure (TA), a suite of tools for creating interactive UNIX exercises. These resemble text adventure games, which immerse the user in a text environment and let them interact with it using textual commands. In our case the ''adventure'' takes place inside a UNIX system and the user interaction happens via the standard UNIX command line. The adventure is a set of exercises, which are presented and automatically evaluated by the system, all from within the command line environment. The suite is released under an open source license, has minimal dependencies and can be used either on a UNIX-style server or a desktop computer running any major OS platform through Docker. We also reflect on our experience of using the presented suite as the primary teaching tool for an introductory UNIX course for Data Scientists and discuss the implications of its deployment in similar courses.

The SARS-CoV-2 evolved from a virus responsible for the SARS epidemic in 2002. The SARS-CoV-2 has a high rate of human-human transmission and originated from the bat. It has a close resemblance with bat-like-SARS-CoV compared to SARS-CoV;however, the Spike protein responsible for virus-host cell interaction possesses the least similarity with that of SARS-CoV.

164863,Impact of COVID-19 on Pediatric Endocrinology Practice and Diabetes Care in Children: A Survey,2021,": As a result of the euro crisis, EU economic governance has been reformed and EU institutions have gained new competences regarding national budgets, with the European Semester (the annual cycle of economic surveillance of the member states) being the most prominent example. With the Commission and the Council being the main actors, and the European Parliament playing only a minor role, a debate about the democratic legitimacy of the Semester and the role of national parliaments (NPs) in this regard has unfolded. This thematic issue, therefore, addresses the question of how parliamentary accountability of the European Semester has evolved: Have NPs met the challenge by adapting to the new situation in a way that allows them to hold the executive accountable? While the contributions to this thematic issue show significant variation across NPs, overall they reveal a rather pessimistic picture: Despite several institutional innovations concerning the reforms of internal rules and procedures, the rise of independent fiscal institutions, inter-parliamentary cooperation, and hearings with the European Commissioners, NPs have remained rather weak actors in EU economic governance also ten years after the Semester’s introduction. Whether recent changes linked to the establishment of the Recovery and Resilience Facility introduced in response to the Covid-19 crisis will change the picture significantly remains to be examined.","Woźniakowski, Tomasz P.; Maatsch, Aleksandra Miklin Eric",Politics and Governance,https://doi.org/10.17645/pag.v9i3.4690,254

While an efficacious vaccine for HEV has been developed, we lack key epidemiologic data needed to understand how best to use the vaccine for hepatitis E control in endemic countries. Methods We conducted a systematic review of articles published on hepatitis E in low and lower-middle-income countries (LMIC) in Africa and Asia. We searched PubMed, Scopus, and Embase databases to identify articles with data on anti-HEV IgG seroprevalence, outbreaks of HEV, or risk factors for HEV infection, disease, or death, and all relevant data were extracted. Using these data we describe the evidence around temporal and geographical distribution of HEV transmission and burden. We estimated pooled age-specific seroprevalence and assessed the consistency in risk factor estimates. Results We extracted data from 148 studies. Studies assessing anti-HEV IgG antibodies used 18 different commercial assays. Most cases of hepatitis E during outbreaks were not confirmed. Risk factor data suggested an increased likelihood of current or recent HEV infection and disease associated with fecal-oral transmission of HEV, as well as exposures to blood and animals. Conclusion Heterogeneity in diagnostic assays used and exposure and outcome assessment methods hinder public health efforts to quantify burden of disease and evaluate interventions over time and space. Prevention tools such as vaccines are available, but require a unified global strategy for hepatitis E control to justify widespread use.","Koyuncu, A.; Mapemba, D.; Ciglenecki, I.; Gurley, E.

Methods: 123 patients were enrolled in a randomized controlled trial at Eskenazi Hospital from April 2020 until October 2020. We permitted participants to either use their own mask (due to low resources institutionally) or we provided a surgical/cloth mask (early on relied on donated cloth masks for patients). Participants were randomized to a control (no tape over the mask/nose) or to the intervention (placing tape over the bridge of the nose of the face mask). The primary outcome of this study is the frequency at which participants correctly wear their masks in the intervention and control groups at 60 minutes into their ED visit. Results: At 60- minutes in the no-tape control group, 31.1% participants were incorrectly wearing the masks, compared to 100% of the intervention group correctly wearing their masks. Subjects who were observed wearing their masks incorrectly (91.1%) exhibited some combination of either their mask removed or their nose and/or mouth exposed. Conclusions: Applying a piece of tape to the bridge of the nose affords a simple, low-cost, low-risk solution that improved the rate of proper mask usage to 100%.","Pettit, N.; Doehring, M.; O'Neill, B.; Zaidi, A.",Annals of Emergency Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annemergmed.2021.07.083,254

Although vaccines development and emergency authorization has been approved by several governments, there has been great concern about its side effects for the long term and its effectiveness against new mutated strains. A resurgence of COVID-19 or related disease can be catastrophic. There is an urgent need to look for effective antiviral agents for many coronavirus strains with minimum side-effects, and maximum efficacy globally. Several, naturally-derived biomolecules have proved their excellent effect on several infectious diseases in a multi-mode fashion by targeting several pathways as well as increasing efficacy with high safety profile. Integrate computational prediction design was used in the study to examine the pharmacology of bioactive compounds of natural origin against SARS-CoV2 spike protein. Keeping these facts we have computationally examined 16 naturally occurring compounds using to evaluate their effectiveness against the SARS-CoV2 virus using the molecular docking technique. Hesperidin derivatives are known to ameliorate diabetes, co-morbidity for coronavirus, as well as help in preventing post coronavirus complications. We found the binding free energy of Hesperidin with spike protein to be -7.57 kcal/mol, the aglycone derivative to be 6.93 kcal/mol, hesperidin monoacetyl derivative to be -7.82 kcal/mol, and hesperidin pentaacetyl derivative to be -8.39 kcal/mol. Our findings revealed that acetylated derivatives of hesperidin showed significant improved remarked binding affinity while aglycone derivative hesperetin showed a decrease in binding affinity. Our studies give a new direction where natural bioactive compounds and their derivatives can be modulated and used after clinical trials to effectively inhibit coronavirus infection as well as diabetes simultaneously with a high safety profile.","Khanal, P.; Chawla, U.; Praveen, S.; Malik, Z.; Malik, S.; Yusuf, M.; Khan, S.

The chapter looks at how the amendments to regulations related to infectious diseases in the aftermath of the MERS outbreak have worked to South Korea’s advantage in fighting Covid-19. However, despite South Korea’s success in “flattening the curve, "" its use of large-scale testing, and information and communication technology (ICT) to track patients raises controversial human rights and privacy issues. The extensive use of surveillance technologies to track and monitor individuals has the potential to infringe upon and limit fundamental human rights.

173070,Analyzing Supply and Demand on a General Internal Medicine Ward: A Cross-Sectional Study,2021-05-21,"With the rising prevalence of multidrug-resistance, there is an urgent need to develop novel antibiotics. Many putative antibiotics demonstrate promising in vitro potency but fail in vivo due to poor drug-like qualities (e.g. serum half-life, oral absorption, solubility, toxicity). These drug-like properties can be modified through the addition of chemical protecting groups, creating “prodrugs” that are activated prior to target inhibition. Lipophilic prodrugging techniques, including the attachment of a pivaloyloxymethyl group, have garnered attention for their ability to increase cellular permeability by masking charged residues and the relative ease of the chemical prodrugging process. Unfortunately, pivaloyloxymethyl prodrugs are rapidly activated by human sera, rendering any membrane permeability qualities absent during clinical treatment. Identification of the bacterial prodrug activation pathway(s) will allow for the development of host-stable and microbe-targeted prodrug therapies. Here, we use two zoonotic staphylococcal species, S. schleiferi and S. pseudintermedius, to establish the mechanism of carboxy ester prodrug activation. Using a forward genetic screen, we identify a conserved locus in both species encoding the enzyme hydroxyacylglutathione hydrolase (GloB), whose loss-of-function confers resistance to carboxy ester prodrugs. We enzymatically characterize GloB and demonstrate that it is a functional glyoxalase II enzyme, which has the capacity to activate carboxy ester prodrugs. As GloB homologs are both widespread and diverse in sequence, our findings suggest that GloB may be a useful mechanism for developing species-or genus-level prodrug targeting strategies.","Mikati, Marwa O.; Miller, Justin J.; Osbourn, Damon M.; Ghebremichael, Naomi; Shah, Ishaan T.; Burnham, Carey-Ann D.; Heidel, Kenneth M.; Yan, Victoria C.; Muller, Florian L.; Dowd, Cynthia S.; Edwards, Rachel L.; Odom John, Audrey R.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.23.214460,254

As critical tourism scholars, we are faced with an unprecedented situation, even as the pandemic looks set to become globally endemic and the true extent of its fullest impacts are only beginning to emerge, with more to surface in the years ahead. That the world faces increasing turmoil is abundantly clear. Yet, amidst the disruption to the everyday, it is hope and compassion, but also political-economic restructuring that is needed to reset the tourism industry in more sustainable, equitable, and ethical directions (Cheer, 2020;Lew, Cheer, Haywood, Brouder, Salazar, 2020;Mostafanezhad, 2020). While in no uncertain terms, the pandemic has forever changed the tourism industry as we once knew it, it is our hope that we can collectively build on the momentum of the inclusive scholarship that Critical Tourism Studies-Asia Pacific is renowned for (Edelheim, 2020;Pernecky, 2020) as we pause to reflect on the possibilities and challenges of tourism in a post-pandemic Asian Century.","Harng Luh, Sin Mostafanezhad Mary Cheer Joseph M.",Tourism Geographies,https://doi.org/10.1080/14616688.2020.1826571,254
182357,The COVID-19 Pandemic and New-Onset Pediatric Type 2 Diabetes,2021,"Background The outbreak of SARS in 2002 lead to a public health ethics discourse. The crisis management of that time was ethically analysed and lessons to be learned discussed. Scholarship and WHO, among others, developed an ethics of pandemic preparedness. The current “corona crisis” also faces us with ethical challenges. This presentation is comparing the two crises from an ethical point of view and a focus on Europe. Methods An ethics framework for pandemic preparedness (Schröder et al. 2006 and Schröder-Bäck 2014) is used to make a synopsis of ethical issues. Ethical aspects of 2002 and 2020 that were discussed in the literature and in the media are compared. For 2020, the focus is on interventions in Italy, Germany, Switzerland, and the Netherlands. Results Topics that emerged from the 2002 crisis were, among others, revolving around aspects of stigmatisation and fair distribution of scarce resources (esp. vaccines, antivirals). Currently, most urgent and ethically challenging aspects relate to social distancing vs. autonomy: Isolation and quarantine are handled differently across Europe and the EU. Questions of transferability of such interventions prevail. Contexts vary vertically over time (2002 vs. 2020) and horizontally (e.g. between Italy and Germany at the same time). Furthermore, trust in authorities, media and health information is a key issue. Conclusions Ethical aspects are key for good pandemic preparedness and management. The context of the crises between 2002 and 2020 has slightly changed, also based on “lessons learned” from 2002. This has implications on ethical issues that are being discussed. New lessons will have to be learned from the 2020 crisis. Key messages Pandemic preparedness and outbreak management entail many ethical tensions that need to be addressed. Currently, questions of trust and transferability are key to the crisis management, further ethical issues could still emerge.","Schröder-Bäck, P.; Schloemer, T.; Martakis, K.; Brall, C.",European Journal of Public Health,https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckaa166.182,254

188823,Integrating nutrition with ecology: balancing the health of humans and biosphere.,2005,"OBJECTIVE This study was performed to evaluate the prognostic significance of the radiographic pattern of disease in probable cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective review of 439 radiographs was performed for 51 patients with a final diagnosis of probable SARS. Forty-nine patients were followed up for a mean interval of 23 days (range, 2-63 days). RESULTS Abnormal findings on a chest radiograph were noted at presentation in 80.4% (41/51) of patients. Four radiographic patterns were seen: normal (group 1) in 19.6% (10/51), focal opacity (group 2) in 39.2% (20/51), multifocal opacities (group 3) in 27.5% (14/51), and diffuse air-space opacification (group 4) in 13.7% (7/51). Radiographic progression of disease occurred in 38.8% (19/49) of the patients in groups 1-4. There were no deaths in groups 1 and 2. In group 3, one (7.7%) of the 13 patients died. Five (71.4%) of the seven patients in group 4 died. Overall, 12.2% (6/49) of the patients died, all of whom had diffuse air-space opacification on the last chest radiograph. In these patients, medical comorbidity was present in 66.7% (4/6), and the exposure history was known in 83.3% (5/6). Death occurred at a mean interval of 18.2 days (range, 9-36 days) from the initial exposure. CONCLUSION Patients presenting with normal findings or focal air-space opacity on chest radiographs had a good clinical outcome. Patients with multifocal opacities that progressed to diffuse air-space opacification and patients presenting with diffuse air-space opacification had a high fatality rate, but patients in this group were also older and more likely to have comorbid conditions. Patients with SARS present with recognizable patterns of disease that have prognostic significance.","Paul, Narinder S; Chung, Taebong; Konen, Eli; Roberts, Heidi C; Rao, T N Anuradha; Gold, Wayne L; Mehta, Sangeeta; Tomlinson, George A; Boylan, Colm E; Grossman, Harvey; Hong, Harry H L; Weisbrod, Gordon L",AJR.

189077,"Protocol for the systematic review of the prevention, treatment and public health management of impetigo, scabies and fungal skin infections in resource-limited settings.",2016,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW Although antibiotic resistance is not often considered an exciting topic for pediatric surgical subspecialists, we face the consequences of increasing antibiotic resistance daily in our clinical practice. By the very nature that our patients are often referred to us after extended periods of medical therapy, antibiotic resistance becomes a significant factor in management of patients both medically and surgically. Antibiotic resistance is increasing, and a number of organisms demonstrate multiple-drug resistance. The purpose of this review is to outline the scope of antibiotic resistance as it relates to pediatric otolaryngology. Specifically, the mechanisms of resistance, the pharmacodynamics involved, and selected infections are discussed. RECENT FINDINGS The children particularly at risk for infections with resistant organisms are those 2 years of age or younger with exposure to daycare and treatment with antimicrobials within the last 30 days. Although there is increasing resistance to antibiotics commonly used for outpatient infections such as otitis media, sinusitis, and tonsillitis, many of the first-line therapies still show significant therapeutic advantage. Vaccines to pneumococcal bacteria have been shown to decrease severe infections. However, there has been only a slight decline in the number of outpatient otolaryngologic infections after vaccination. SUMMARY Therefore, children who have received multiple courses of antibiotics, are 2 years of age or younger, attend daycare, or have received antimicrobial therapy within the last 30 days may need high-dose therapy or antimicrobial therapy with an increased spectrum of coverage. Those children with infections that do not respond clinically to appropriate therapy should be treated with the suspicion of multiple-drug resistant strains being present. Continued surveillance of resistance patterns within individual communities, especially areas served by children's hospitals, are important, as there are distinct local and regional differences in antimicrobial resistance.","Andrews, Thomas M",Current opinion in otolaryngology & head and neck surgery,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14631171/,254

However, the framing of outbreaks and representations of foodborne pathogens in the media discourse are not necessarily homogeneous. Drawing on previous research on media coverage of emerging diseases and on the conceptual tools of framing theory, this paper explores the diversity of frames and representations used in the media coverage of two listeriosis outbreaks that occurred in Canada in fall 2008. In the dominant war against microbes frame, microbes are portrayed as posing serious risks that call for stringent control measures. This frame coexists with other frames which rather emphasize economic, ecosystem or nutrition issues and which are supported by representations of microbial risks that either mitigate these risks, present them as inevitable or as less serious than others. The implications of these observations for the public understanding of foodborne microbial risks are discussed.","Gauthier, Elisabeth",Public understanding of science,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21657136/,254

192779,"Portable monitoring devices for diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea at home: review of accuracy, cost-effectiveness, guidelines, and coverage in Canada.",2010,"Infections of rodents by murine coronaviruses can lead to chronic diseases of the central nervous system. These infections are interesting systems to study mechanisms which could be relevant for the pathogenesis of certain human diseases. One major factor influencing the outcome of infection is related to the virus. To understand the virological basis for neurovirulence we compared JHM-virus isolates with different biological properties. JHM-Wt causes only acute disease, JHM-Ts43 a demyelinating encephalomyelitis and a virus shedded from persistently infected cells (JHM-Pi) is not virulent at all. The spread of these viruses in glial cell cultures reflects their different neurovirulence for animals. The peplomer E2 of these viruses reveals structural and antigenic differences. We characterised the epitopes of E2 with a panel of monoclonal antibodies. Four epitopes are associated with regions important for neutralisation, cell fusion and attachment. More than five epitopes are not related to such functions. Epitopes differ in their location and accessibility on the E2 protein subunits between JHM-Wt, JHM-Ts43 and JHM-Pi. To identify epitopes in regions important for pathogenesis, we performed animal studies with variants selected by monoclonal antibodies. Variants changed in a defined epitope (E2-Ba) induce in Balb/c mice a chronic disease. Variants changed in only one of the other three neutralisation epitopes induce acute disease. These results support and extend the observation that the peplomer protein E2 is a major determinant for virulence and antigenic variability of coronaviruses 1,4,5,6,8,10,17,19,22,23. Increasing evidence had been obtained that certain structural features of this protein are important for the cell tropism of the virus. Furthermore, this protein influences strongly the type and specificity of immune responses against viral and host antigens. The highly advanced knowledge on structure and replication of coronaviruses will be of great value to analyze further mechanisms leading to inflammatory demyelinating diseases associated with a persistent virus infection.","Wege, H; Winter, J; Massa, P; Dörries, R; ter Meulen, V",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2449042/,254

Disposable cages were prefilled with either corncob or α-cellulose bedding and were used to house 2 adult Sprague-Dawley rats (experimental condition) or contained no animals (control). Rats were observed and intracage ammonia levels measured daily for 21 d. Intracage ammonia accumulation became significant by day 8 in experimental cages containing α-cellulose bedding, whereas experimental cages containing corncob bedding did not reach detectable levels of ammonia until day 14. In all 3 experimental cages containing α-cellulose, ammonia exceeded 100 ppm (our maximum acceptable limit) by day 11. Two experimental corncob cages required changing at days 16 and 17, whereas the remaining cage containing corncob bedding lasted the entire 21 d without reaching the 100-ppm ammonia threshold. These data suggests that corncob bedding provides nearly twice the service life of α-cellulose bedding in the IVC system.","Koontz, Jason M; Kumsher, David M; Kelly, Richard; Stallings, Jonathan D",Journal of the American Association for Laboratory Animal Science : JAALAS,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26817976/,254
195142,Implications of the SARS outbreak for Canadian emergency departments.,2003,"OBJECTIVE This report surveys and evaluates the scientific research on evidence-based healthcare design and extracts its implications for designing better and safer hospitals. BACKGROUND It builds on a literature review conducted by researchers in 2004. METHODS Research teams conducted a new and more exhaustive search for rigorous empirical studies that link the design of hospital physical environments with healthcare outcomes. The review followed a two-step process, including an extensive search for existing literature and a screening of each identified study for the relevance and quality of evidence. RESULTS This review found a growing body of rigorous studies to guide healthcare design, especially with respect to reducing the frequency of hospital-acquired infections. Results are organized according to three general types of outcomes: patient safety, other patient outcomes, and staff outcomes. The findings further support the importance of improving outcomes for a range of design characteristics or interventions, including single-bed rooms rather than multibed rooms, effective ventilation systems, a good acoustic environment, nature distractions and daylight, appropriate lighting, better ergonomic design, acuity-adaptable rooms, and improved floor layouts and work settings. Directions for future research are also identified. CONCLUSIONS The state of knowledge of evidence-based healthcare design has grown rapidly in recent years. The evidence indicates that well-designed physical settings play an important role in making hospitals safer and more healing for patients, and better places for staff to work.","Ulrich, Roger S; Zimring, Craig; Zhu, Xuemei; DuBose, Jennifer; Seo, Hyun-Bo; Choi, Young-Seon; Quan, Xiaobo; Joseph, Anjali",HERD,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21161908/,254

A total of 34 stool specimens were obtained from preterm infants upon admission and once weekly up to two weeks during hospitalization. The presumptive colonies of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were selected for identification, antibiotic susceptibility testing, and subtyping by using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Out of 76 Gram-negative isolates, highest resistance was detected for amoxicillin/clavulanate (30.8%, n = 16), ceftriaxone (42.3%, n = 22), ceftazidime (28.8%, n = 15), cefoxitin (28.8%, n = 15), aztreonam (36.5%, n = 19), and polymyxin B (23.1%, n = 12). Three colistin resistant K. pneumoniae have also been detected based on E-test analysis. Thirty-nine isolates of K. pneumoniae and 20 isolates of E. coli were resistant to more than three antimicrobial classes and were categorized as multidrug resistant (MDR). PFGE analysis revealed a higher diversity in pulsotypes for K. pneumoniae (18 pulsotypes) in comparison to E. coli (four pulsotypes). In addition, a total of fifteen pulsotypes was observed from 39 MDR K. pneumoniae. The risk factors for antibiotic resistance were assessed using random forest analysis. Gender was found to be the most important predictor for colistin resistant while length, OFC, and delivery mode were showing greater predictive power in the polymyxin B resistance.

In 2002, Taiwan instituted a system in which hospitals are reimbursed for drug expenditures at full price from a fixed global budget before the remaining budget is allocated to reimburse all other expenditures, often at discounted prices. Providers are thus given a financial incentive to increase prescriptions. METHODOLOGY We isolate the effect of this system from that of other confounding factors by estimating a difference-in-difference model to analyze monthly drug expenditures of hospital departments for outpatients during the years 1999-2006. FINDINGS Our results suggest that hospital departments which use drugs more heavily as part of their regular medical care increased their drug prescription expenditures after the implementation of the global budget system. In addition, we find that the response was stronger among for-profit than not-for-profit and public hospitals. IMPLICATIONS Hospital doctors responded to the financial incentive created by the particular global budgeting system adopted in Taiwan by increasing expenditures on drug treatments for outpatients.","Chou, Shin-Yi; Deily, Mary E; Lien, Hsien-Ming; Zhang, Jing Hua",Advances in health economics and health services research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20575230/,254

However, emerging pathogens could pose future threats, particularly those with blood-borne stages that are resistant to viral-inactivation steps in the manufacturing process, such as non-lipid-coated viruses. As outlined in this Review, better understanding of infectious diseases allows challenges from newly described agents of potential concern in the future to be anticipated, but the processes of zoonotic transmission and genetic selection or modification ensure that plasma-derived products will continue to be subject to infectious concerns. Manufacturers of plasma-derived CFC have addressed the issue of emerging infectious agents by developing recombinant products that limit the need for human plasma during production. Such recombinant products have extended the safety profile of their predecessors by ensuring that all reagents used for cell culture, purification steps, and stabilisation and storage buffers are completely independent of human plasma.","Ludlam, Christopher A; Powderly, William G; Bozzette, Samuel; Diamond, Michael; Koerper, Marion A; Kulkarni, Roshni; Ritchie, Bruce; Siegel, Jamie; Simmonds, Peter; Stanley, Samuel; Tapper, Michael L; von Depka, Mario",Lancet,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16427495/,254

Phylogenetic analysis of 24 putative proteins and polypeptides showed that the 22 CoV HKU1 strains fell into three clusters (genotype A, 13 strains; genotype B, 3 strains and genotype C, 6 strains). However, different phylogenetic relationships among the three clusters were observed in different regions of their genomes. From nsp4 to nsp6, the genotype A strains were clustered with the genotype B strains. For nsp7 and nsp8 and from nsp10 to nsp16, the genotype A strains were clustered with the genotype C strains. From hemagglutinin esterase (HE) to nucleocapsid (N), the genotype B strains were clustered closely with the genotype C strains. Bootscan analysis showed possible recombination between genotypes B and C from nucleotide positions 11,500 to 13,000, corresponding to the nsp6-nsp7 junction, giving rise to genotype A, and between genotypes A and B from nucleotide positions 21,500 to 22,500, corresponding to the nsp16-HE junction, giving rise to genotype C. Multiple alignments further narrowed the sites of crossover to a 143-bp region between nucleotide positions 11,750 and 11,892 and a 29-bp region between nucleotide positions 21,502 and 21,530. Genome analysis also revealed various numbers of tandem copies of a perfect 30-base acidic tandem repeat (ATR) which encodes NDDEDVVTGD and various numbers and sequences of imperfect repeats in the N terminus of nsp3 inside the acidic domain upstream of papain-like protease 1 among the 22 genomes. All 10 CoV HKU1 strains with incomplete imperfect repeats (1.4 and 4.4) belonged to genotype A. The present study represents the first evidence for natural recombination in coronavirus associated with human infection. Analysis of a single gene is not sufficient for the genotyping of CoV HKU1 strains but requires amplification and sequencing of at least two gene loci, one from nsp10 to nsp16 (e.g., pol or helicase) and another from HE to N (e.g., spike or N). Further studies will delineate whether the ATR is useful for the molecular typing of CoV HKU1.","Woo, Patrick C Y; Lau, Susanna K P; Yip, Cyril C Y; Huang, Yi; Tsoi, Hoi-Wah; Chan, Kwok-Hung; Yuen, Kwok-Yung",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16809319/,254

200032,COVID-19 and rationally layered social distancing,2020,"OBJECTIVE Kakkonto, a Japanese herbal medicine, is frequently used to treat the common cold not only with a physician's prescription, but also in self-medication situations. This study aimed to examine whether Kakkonto prevents the aggravation of cold symptoms if taken at an early stage of illness compared with a well-selected Western-style multiple cold medicine. METHODS This study was a multicenter, active drug-controlled, randomized trial. Adults 18 to 65 years of age who felt a touch of cold symptoms and visited 15 outpatient healthcare facilities within 48 hours of symptoms onset were enrolled. The participants were randomly assigned to two groups: one treated with Kakkonto (Kakkonto Extract-A, 6 g/day) (n=209) and one treated with a Western-style multiple cold medicine (Pabron Gold-A, 3.6 g/day) (n=198) for at most four days. The primary outcome of this study was the aggravation of cold, nasal, throat or bronchial symptoms, scored as moderate or severe and lasting for at least two days within five days after entry into the study. RESULTS Among the 410 enrollees, 340 (168 in the Kakkonto group and 172 in the Pabron group) were included in the analyses. The proportion of participants whose colds were aggravated was 22.6% in the Kakkonto group and 25.0% in the Pabron group (p=0.66). The overall severity of the cold symptoms was not significantly different between the groups. No harmful adverse events occurred in either group. CONCLUSION Kakkonto did not significantly prevent the progression of cold symptoms, even when prescribed at an early stage of the disease.","Okabayashi, Satoe; Goto, Masashi; Kawamura, Takashi; Watanabe, Hidetsuna; Kimura, Akira; Uruma, Reiko; Takahashi, Yuko; Taneichi, Setsuko; Musashi, Manabu; Miyaki, Koichi",Internal medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24785885/,254

Because naturally occurring exacerbations are inherently difficult to study, only recently have we understood underlying pathophysiological mechanisms and the true prevalence of viral exacerbations. Data are also emerging to support a potential role for chronic viral infection in the progression of stable COPD.

201296,Increased number of brought-in-dead cases with COVID-19: is it due to poor health-seeking behaviour among the Zambian population?,2020,"Human epidemiological studies have shown that low birth weight is associated with hypertension in adulthood. Rodent models of intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) support these findings because offspring from undernourished dams develop hypertension. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a newly described renin-angiotensin system (RAS) component that competes with ACE for angiotensin peptide hydrolysis and therefore may modulate blood pressure. However, ACE2 potential participation in hypertension programming remains unknown, although RAS alterations were reported in IUGR models. Hence, we first investigated the tissue distribution of ACE2 and ACE in the rat and then whether hypertension programming differentially affects both enzymes. Using multiplex RT-PCR and in situ hybridization, we show that ACE2 mRNA is widely expressed and coregionalized with ACE. Moreover, tissues involved in blood pressure homeostasis (lung, heart, and kidney) express high levels of both enzymes. Enzymatic assays reveal that ACE2 and ACE are coactive in these tissues. Adult (4-month-old) offspring from 70% food-restricted dams throughout gestation (FR30 rats) present mild hypertension, impaired renal morphology, as well as elevated plasma angiotensin II and aldosterone, suggesting alterations of the systemic RAS. In FR30 rats, we show that ACE2 and ACE activities are increased only in the lung, whereas their mRNA expression is not significantly altered, showing that the enzymes display tissue-specific sensitivity to programming. Our results indicate that ACE2 and ACE are coexpressed in numerous rat tissues and that their increased activity in the lung of FR30 rats may participate in hypertension programming.","Rivière, Guillaume; Michaud, Annie; Breton, Christophe; VanCamp, Gilles; Laborie, Christine; Enache, Mihaela; Lesage, Jean; Deloof, Sylvie; Corvol, Pierre; Vieau, Didier",Hypertension,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16203874/,254

RESULTS The force ratio needed to remove the wound filler from the wound bed after treatment with negative pressure was greater for foam than for gauze. NPWT caused the wound bed tissue to grow into the foam, while there was no such ingrowth into gauze. Furthermore, beneath the foam there was more leukocyte infiltration, tissue disorganization, disruption of contact among cells, and differences in size among cells. The results were similar regardless of the level of negative pressure. CONCLUSION More force was required to remove foam compared to gauze following NPWT, which may have been due to greater ingrowth into foam. These findings may explain the patient discomfort and wound bed disruption upon removal of foam. The observed differences in wound bed tissue morphology under foam and gauze are in accordance with the clinically observed differences in quality of granulation tissue formation.","Borgquist, Olga; Gustafson, Lotta; Ingemansson, Richard; Malmsjo, Malin",Wounds : a compendium of clinical research and practice,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25902776/,254

Yet there is enough evidence so far to suggest possible approaches to therapy for these two diseases that could go beyond attempting to address specific signs and symptoms (of which there are many) and instead target the pathophysiology underlying MECP2 disorders.

207547,COVID-19 in people living with diabetes: An international consensus,2020,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel emerging pathogen causing an unprecedented pandemic in 21st century medicine. Due to the significant health and economic burden of the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, there is a huge unmet medical need for novel interventions effectively blocking SARS-CoV-2 infection. Unknown details of SARS-CoV-2 cellular biology hamper the development of potent and highly specific SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics. Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) has been reported to be the primary receptor for SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry. However, emerging scientific evidence suggests the involvement of additional membrane proteins, such as heparan sulfate proteoglycans, in SARS-CoV-2 internalization. Here, we report that syndecans, the evolutionarily conserved family of transmembrane proteoglycans, facilitate the cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2. Among syndecans, the lung abundant syndecan-4 was the most efficient in mediating SARS-CoV-2 uptake. The S1 subunit of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein plays a dominant role in the virus's interactions with syndecans. Besides the polyanionic heparan sulfate chains, other parts of the syndecan ectodomain, such as the cell-binding domain, also contribute to the interaction with SARS-CoV-2. During virus internalization, syndecans colocalize with ACE2, suggesting a jointly shared internalization pathway. Both ACE2 and syndecan inhibitors exhibited significant efficacy in reducing the cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2, thus supporting the complex nature of internalization. Data obtained on syndecan specific in vitro assays present syndecans as novel cellular targets of SARS-CoV-2 and offer molecularly precise yet simple strategies to overcome the complex nature of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Hudák, Anett; Letoha, Annamária; Szilák, László; Letoha, Tamás",Int. j. mol. sci.

208882,The Appropriate Use of Testing for COVID-19,2020,"OBJECTIVES: To assess (1) the willingness to get a COVID-19 vaccine among Medicare beneficiaries, (2) the associated factors, and (3) the reasons for vaccine hesitancy. METHODS: Data were taken from the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS) 2020 Fall COVID-19 Supplement, conducted October-November 2020. Willingness to get a COVID-19 vaccine was measured by respondents' answer to whether they would get a COVID-19 vaccine when available. We classified responses of ""definitely"" and ""probably"" as ""willing to get,"" and responses ""probably not,"" ""definitely not,"" and ""not sure"" as ""vaccine hesitancy."" Reasons for vaccine hesitancy were assessed by a series of yes/no questions focusing on 10 potential reasons. The analytical sample included 6715 adults 65 years and older. We conducted a logistic regression model to assess demographic factors and other factors associated with the willingness to get a COVID-19 vaccine. All analyses were conducted in Stata 14 and accounted for the complex survey design of MCBS. RESULTS: Overall, 61.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 59.1-63.0) of Medicare beneficiaries would be willing to get a vaccine when available. Among those who were hesitant, more than 40% reported that mistrust of the government and side effects as the main reasons. Logistic regression model results showed that non-Hispanic Blacks (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.33; 95% CI, 0.24-0.44) and Hispanics (AOR = 0.60; 95% CI, 0.47-0.77) were less willing to get a vaccine than non-Hispanic Whites; beneficiaries with an income of less than $25 000 (AOR = 0.71; 95% CI, 0.62-0.81) were less willing to get the vaccine than those with an income of $25 000 or more; those who did not think that the COVID-19 virus was more contagious (AOR = 0.53; 95% CI, 0.41-0.69) or more deadly (AOR = 0.51; 95% CI, 0.41-0.65) were also less willing to get the vaccine than those who thought that the virus was more contagious or more deadly than the influenza virus. CONCLUSIONS: The 2020 MCBS survey data showed that close to 40% of Medicare beneficiaries were hesitant about getting a COVID-19 vaccine, and the hesitancy was greater in racial/ethnic minorities. Medicare beneficiaries were concerned about the safety of the vaccine, and some appeared to be misinformed. Evidence-based educational and policy-level interventions need to be implemented to further promote COVID-19 vaccination.","Luo, Huabin; Qu, Haiyan; Basu, Rashmita; Rafferty, Ann P; Patil, Shivajirao P; Cummings, Doyle M",J. public health manag. pract.

210426,How emergency departments prepare for virus disease outbreaks like COVID-19,2020,"Purpose: As educators across the globe are tasked with taking teaching online, this paper shares a culture-centered approach to transitioning to education at a distance. Specifically, in this essay, a focus is placed on how one school preserved their collaborative culture among administrators, teachers and staff. The purpose of this paper is to provide guidance to school leadership during this public health crisis. Design/methodology/approach: To ensure trustworthiness in this naturalistic inquiry, a triangulation was made of contributing authors’ perspectives to present theory-informed insights. Findings: This school’s transition to online education was guided by a shared goal to not only move content online but also a rich participatory culture among staff. Critical forms of participation and community practices are presented that were pivotal in supporting teachers through the transition. Insights equip school leaders and administrators potentially remaining online, at least in part, through the next school year. Practical implications: Schools undergoing the shift to teaching online should attend to cultural shifts and create conditions in which staff members can collaborate at higher levels. Originality/value: New administrator-level insights are contributed regarding the organizational shift to teaching elementary school online, a minimally researched topic.","Justis, Nathan; Litts, Breanne K.; Reina, Laura; Rhodes, Shannon",inform.Learn.Sci,,254
210429,How emergency departments prepare for virus disease outbreaks like COVID-19,2020,"The uncertainties and scale of the Covid-19 pandemic has mobilised global anxieties and insecurities, and many cultural groups have conjuncturally embedded conspiracy theories within millennial and apocalyptic thought to explain and find meaning in the pandemic. The apocalypse lends itself well to conspiratorial thinking because conceptually it is flexible enough to reflect any crisis. To this end, the global development of Covid-19 conspiracism is what the authors term 'contagious conspiracism' which is defined as viral global cultural conspiracism. The paper explores how millennialist responses to Covid-19 in various media outlets transcend academic categories of analysis and cultural boundaries between, say, religious and secular, far-right and radical left. First explored is how the crisis became embedded in established (mainly American) contemporary millennial beliefs and prophecies through selected far-right, evangelical and radical left narratives. Second, it is shown how these theories have been 'improvised' to include 5 G and also travelled to Europe and taken on geographical significance in Belfast and Berlin. Third, the authors illustrate the shared ingredients, motivations, and semiotics across apocalyptic conspiratorial Covid-19 narratives, all of which resonate with concerns about power, specifically emergent surveillance technologies, governmental abuse of power, and neoliberal capital, with divergent truths about who is blame from 5 G/vaccine theories to corporate technocapitalism. The paper concludes that these shared discourses across apocalyptic and conspiratorial Covid-19 narratives mean many of us are conspiracists and/or conspiracy theorists at some level and is therefore both revealing of the similarities and has the potential to create democratic constituencies.","Sturm, Tristan; Albrecht, Tom",Anthropol Med,,254

211362,40 Racial Disparity and Covid-19 Outcomes: An Emergency Department Study,2020,"Diagnostic assays for detecting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are essential for patient management, infection prevention, and the public health response for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The efficacy and reliability of these assays are of paramount importance in both tracking and controlling the spread of the virus. Real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) assays rely on a fixed genetic sequence for primer and probe binding. Mutations can potentially alter the accuracy of these assays and lead to unpredictable analytical performance characteristics and false-negative results. Here, we identify a G-to-U transversion (nucleotide 26372) in the SARS-CoV-2 E gene in three specimens with reduced viral detection efficiency using a widely available commercial assay. Further analysis of the public GISAID repository led to the identification of 18 additional genomes with this mutation, which reflect five independent mutational events. This work supports the use of dual-target assays to reduce the number of false-negative PCR results.","Tahan, Stephen; Parikh, Bijal A; Droit, Lindsay; Wallace, Meghan A; Burnham, Carey-Ann D; Wang, David",J Clin Microbiol,,254

The numerical simulations are carried out on a simple economical model with a finite number of economic agents, which are able to exchange goods/services and money;the various agents interact each other by means of random exchanges. The model is micro founded, self-consistent, and predictive. Despite the simplicity of the model, the simulations show a complex and non-trivial behavior. First of all, we are able to recognize two solution classes, namely two phases, separated by a threshold region. The analysis of the wealth distribution of the model agents, in the threshold region, shows functional forms resembling empirical quantitative studies of the probability distributions of wealth and income in the United Kingdom and the United States. Furthermore, the decile distribution of the population wealth of the simulated model, in the threshold region, overlaps in a suggestive way with the real data of the Italian population wealth in the last few years. Finally, the results of the simulated model allow us to draw important considerations for designing effective policies for economic and human development.","Giunta, Andrea Giunta Gaetano Marino Domenico Oliveri Francesco",Mathematical &amp; Computational Applications,,254

Being a successor of a natural product, crocetin, TSC is being investigated for various cancers as a radiosensitizer owing to its oxygen diffusion enhancement capability. The unique properties of TSC make it a promising therapeutic agent for various ailments such as hemorrhagic shock, stroke, heart attack, among others. The present review outlines various (bio)synthetic strategies, pharmacological aspects, clinical overview and potential therapeutic benefits of crocetin and related compounds including TSC. The recent literature focusing on the delivery aspects of these compounds is covered as well to paint the complete picture to the curious reader.

214388,The prognostic impact of thyroid disorders on the clinical severity of COVID-19: Results of single-centre pandemic hospital,2021,"Although endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are known to harbor cis-regulatory elements, their role in modulating cellular immune responses remains poorly understood. Using an RNA-seq approach, we show that several members of the ERV9 lineage, particularly LTR12C elements, are activated upon HIV-1 infection of primary CD4+ T cells. Intriguingly, HIV-1-induced ERVs harboring transcription start sites are primarily found in the vicinity of immunity genes. For example, HIV-1 infection activates LTR12C elements upstream of the interferon-inducible genes GBP2 and GBP5 that encode for broad-spectrum antiviral factors. Reporter assays demonstrated that these LTR12C elements drive gene expression in primary CD4+ T cells. In line with this, HIV-1 infection triggered the expression of a unique GBP2 transcript variant by activating a cryptic transcription start site within LTR12C. Furthermore, stimulation with HIV-1-induced cytokines increased GBP2 and GBP5 expression in human cells, but not in macaque cells that naturally lack the GBP5 gene and the LTR12C element upstream of GBP2. Finally, our findings suggest that GBP2 and GBP5 have already been active against ancient viral pathogens as they suppress the maturation of the extinct retrovirus HERV-K (HML-2). In summary, our findings uncover how human cells can exploit remnants of once-infectious retroviruses to regulate antiviral gene expression.","Srinivasachar Badarinarayan, Smitha; Shcherbakova, Irina; Langer, Simon; Koepke, Lennart; Preising, Andrea; Hotter, Dominik; Kirchhoff, Frank; Sparrer, Konstantin M J; Schotta, Gunnar; Sauter, Daniel",Nucleic Acids Res,,254

The increasingly common presence of cardiovascular disease in patients during or after cancer treatment led to the rapid growth of the field of cardio-oncology with a mandate of identifying, treating, and preventing the various forms of cardiovascular disease seen among this population. This review evaluates the implications of the pandemic on the practice and study of cardio-oncology. The evolving understanding of the relationship between comorbid disease and clinical outcomes among this population is assessed. With the impetus of the pandemic, cardio-oncology can be deliberate in embracing changes to cardiac screening, monitoring, and intervention during oncology care. Bridging 2 specialties, consideration of the lessons learned in cancer and cardiovascular may pivotally inform ongoing therapeutic efforts. Further, the development of multicenter registries focused on understanding and optimizing outcomes among these patients should be considered.

222519,Association of Inflammatory Markers with Mortality in COVID-19 Infection,2020,"SARS-CoV-2 led to considerable morbidity/mortality worldwide and tremendously impacted on daily life. Strict lockdown measures were implemented early to contain the viral outbreak in Austria. Massive changes in organizational structures of healthcare facilities followed with unclear implications on the care of non-COVID-19-affected patients. We studied the nationwide impact of COVID-19 on kidney transplantation in Austria during the first six months of 2020. Concurrent with general lockdown measures, all kidney transplant activity was suspended from 13 March to 9 April. Nevertheless, between January and June, total transplant (p = 0.48) and procured donor organ numbers (p = 0.6) did not differ significantly from earlier years. Ten (0.18%) of 5512 prevalent Austrian kidney transplant recipients were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2. The case fatality rate (one death; 10%) in renal transplant patients was less than in other countries but higher than in Austria's general population (2.4%). We conclude that early and strict general lockdown measures imposed by the government allowed an early, however cautious, re-opening of Austrian transplant programs and played a crucial role for the favorable outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 in Austrian kidney transplant patients. Even though it may be uncertain whether similar results may be obtainable in other countries, the findings may support early intervention strategies during similar episodes in the future.","Watschinger, Bruno; Watschinger, Clara; Reindl-Schwaighofer, Roman; Meyer, Elias L; Deak, Andras T; Hammer, Tamara; Eigner, Manfred; Sprenger-Mähr, Hannelore; Schneeberger, Stefan; Cejka, Daniel; Mayer, Gert; Oberbauer, Rainer; Rosenkranz, Alexander R; Kerschbaum, Julia",,,254

Italy has one of the highest numbers of SARS-CoV-2-related deaths and one of the highest mortality rates. Worldwide, a more severe course of COVID-19 is associated with older age, comorbidities, and male sex. Hence, we searched for possible genetic components of COVID-19 severity among Italians by looking at expression levels and variants in ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes, crucial for viral infection.Exome and SNP-array data from a large Italian cohort were used to compare the rare-variants burden and polymorphisms frequency with Europeans and East Asians. Moreover, we looked into gene expression databases to check for sex-unbalanced expression.While we found no significant evidence that ACE2 is associated with disease severity/sex bias, TMPRSS2 levels and genetic variants proved to be possible candidate disease modulators, prompting for rapid experimental validations on large patient cohorts.","Asselta, Rosanna; Paraboschi, Elvezia Maria; Mantovani, Alberto; Duga, Stefano",Aging (Albany NY),,254

226198,Association of ERCC gene polymorphism with osteosarcoma risk,2020,"This paper describes a hands-on comparison on using state-of-the-art music source separation deep neural networks (DNNs) before and after task-specific fine-tuning for separating speech content from non-speech content in broadcast audio (i.e., dialog separation). The music separation models are selected as they share the number of channels (2) and sampling rate (44.1 kHz or higher) with the considered broadcast content, and vocals separation in music is considered as a parallel for dialog separation in the target application domain. These similarities are assumed to enable transfer learning between the tasks. Three models pre-trained on music (Open-Unmix, Spleeter, and Conv-TasNet) are considered in the experiments, and fine-tuned with real broadcast data. The performance of the models is evaluated before and after fine-tuning with computational evaluation metrics (SI-SIRi, SI-SDRi, 2f-model), as well as with a listening test simulating an application where the non-speech signal is partially attenuated, e.g., for better speech intelligibility. The evaluations include two reference systems specifically developed for dialog separation. The results indicate that pre-trained music source separation models can be used for dialog separation to some degree, and that they benefit from the fine-tuning, reaching a performance close to task-specific solutions.","Strauss, Martin; Paulus, Jouni; Torcoli, Matteo; Edler, Bernd",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.09093v2.pdf,254
226867,Prevalence and predictors of psychological response during immediate COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND/AIM: SARS-CoV-2, a ribonucleic acid coronavirus, rapidly spread worldwide within a short timeframe. Although different antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory drugs are used, current evidence is insufficient as to which drug is more efficient. Our study compared favipiravir and lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/RTV) therapies in inpatient care for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Demographic data, test results, treatments, and latest status of patients receiving inpatient COVID-19 pneumonia therapy were recorded. The initial favipiravir and LPV/RTV receiving groups were compared regarding the need for intensive care units (ICU) and mortality. Logistic regression analysis was performed by including variables showing significant differences as a result of paired comparisons into the model. RESULTS: Of the 204 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, 59 (28.9%), 131 (64.2%), and 14 were administered LPV/RTV, favipiravir, and favipiravir with LPV/RTV, respectively. No difference was found in age, sex, presence of comorbidity, and tocilizumab, systemic corticosteroid, and plasma therapy use between patients administered with these three different treatment regimens. The mean mortality age of the patients was 71±14.3 years, which was substantially greater than that of the survivors (54.2±15.5 years). Compared with patients administered with LPV/RTV, ICU admission and mortality rates were lower in patients administered with favipiravir. CK-MB, AST, CRP, LDH, and creatinine levels were higher, whereas lymphocyte counts were lower in patients who died. Age, AST, CRP, LDH, and neutrophil counts were higher in patients needing ICU, and eosinophil and lymphocyte counts were significantly lower. Logistic regression analysis showed that favipiravir use independently decreased mortality (P=0.006). CONCLUSION: The use of favipiravir was more effective than LPV/RTV in reducing mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.","Çinarka, HalIt; GÜnlÜoGlu, GÜlSah; ÇÖrtÜk, Mustafa; Yurt, SIbel; Kiyik, Murat; KoSar, AySe FIlIz; TanriverdI, ElIf; Arslan, MelIh Akay; BaydIlI, KÜrSad NurI; KoÇ, Aysu SInem; Altin, Sedat; ÇetInkaya, ErdoGan",Turkish journal of medical sciences,,254

229057,Suicide Prevention Among College Students Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Protocol for a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,2021,"Obesity is a disease that affects 1/3 of the US population that could lead to several comorbidities. Obesity induces cognitive and behavioral impairment. Low plasma vitamin D levels are associated with increased body mass index (BMI). Therefore, vitamin D supplementation has shown benefits in BMI, glucose homeostasis and cognitive/behavioral function;however, contradictory data exists in animal models and remains poorly studied. Obesity in males increases 5.7-fold the risk for severe complications and death due to SARSCoV-2. Brain RAS activity, especially activation of the Angiotensin II receptor (AT1R), has been implicated in cognitive impairment and may participate in persistent neurological symptoms seen in 1 in 3 severe COVID-19 cases, i.e., disorientation, inattention and ataxia. Supplementation with Vitamin D (VitD), known to ameliorate respiratory infections and thromboembolism, may protect against COVID symptoms by increasing ACE2 and Masr expression. To generate a diet-induced obesity (DIO) model, C57Bl6/J male mice (7 wks of age) were randomly assigned to 3 groups (n=10/group) and were fed ad libitum with a) chow diet (CD), b) lard-based high-fat diet (HFD, 60% fat;D12492;Research diet, New Brunswick, NJ), or c) HFD supplemented with vitamin D (60% fat plus 15,000 IU/kg diet, HVitD). Behavioral and metabolic endpoints were measured starting at 7 wks on diet. The HFD diet was effective in generating DIO vs CD despite equivalent food intake consumption on a kcal-basis. Body composition analysis (EchoMRI) showed increased fat mass in HFD and HVitD when compared to CD. Contrary to our hypothesis, ip glucose (0.25 mg/kg) caused greater glucose intolerance in HVitD relative to HFD at 15 (P&lt;0.05) and 30 min (P&lt;0.01) post injection. HFD and HVitD groups showed insulin resistance relative to CD while having an equal glucose clearance post insulin bolus (3.75 U/kg;ip). Cognitive ability was assessed using novel object recognition (NORT), passive avoidance (PAT) and transfer latency (TL) on the elevated plus maze (EPM) tests. There was no effect of DIO on NORT. Surprisingly, in the PAT, VitD supplementation reduced conditioned anxiety as seen by a decreased step-through latency to aversive chamber (3 d retention), suggesting poorer fear-based learning relative to HFD (P&lt;0.01). No effect was seen on TL. Increased anxiety was observed on EPM in HFD (P&lt;0.04), as indicated by decreased time in the open arm relative to that in CD. Reduced locomotor activity was observed on the open field test (OF) in HFD and HVitD groups in the last 4 min of a 10 min test duration. Molecular analysis of RAS genes in the brain using RNAscope is currently underway. In conclusion, Vitamin D supplementation (15,000 IU/kg diet) was not effective in protecting against DIO and glucose intolerance. Importantly, VitD also reduced fear-based learning.","Kozlova, Elena Denys Maximillian Carabelli Bruno Bishay Anthony Schoepf Laura Curras-Collazo Margarita Gutierrez-Aguilar Ruth",The FASEB Journal,,254

Here, we analyse the supply-chain effects of a set of idealized lockdown scenarios, using the latest global trade modelling framework. We find that supply-chain losses that are related to initial COVID-19 lockdowns are largely dependent on the number of countries imposing restrictions and that losses are more sensitive to the duration of a lockdown than its strictness. However, a longer containment that can eradicate the disease imposes a smaller loss than shorter ones. Earlier, stricter and shorter lockdowns can minimize overall losses. A 'go-slow' approach to lifting restrictions may reduce overall damages if it avoids the need for further lockdowns. Regardless of the strategy, the complexity of global supply chains will magnify losses beyond the direct effects of COVID-19. Thus, pandemic control is a public good that requires collective efforts and support to lower-capacity countries.","Guan, Dabo; Wang, Daoping; Hallegatte, Stephane; Davis, Steven J; Huo, Jingwen; Li, Shuping; Bai, Yangchun; Lei, Tianyang; Xue, Qianyu; Coffman, D039; Maris,; Cheng, Danyang; Chen, Peipei; Liang, Xi; Xu, Bing; Lu, Xiaosheng; Wang, Shouyang; Hubacek, Klaus; Gong, Peng",Nat Hum Behav,,254

In contrast to conventional particle filters, the Bayesian update step in FPF is implemented via a mean-field type feedback control law. The objective for this paper is to situate the development of FPF and related controlled interacting particle system algorithms within the framework of optimal transportation theory. Starting from the simplest setting of the Bayes' update formula, a coupling viewpoint is introduced to construct particle filters. It is shown that the conventional importance sampling resampling particle filter implements an independent coupling. Design of optimal couplings is introduced first for the simple Gaussian settings and subsequently extended to derive the FPF algorithm. The final half of the paper provides a review of some of the salient aspects of the FPF algorithm including the feedback structure, algorithms for gain function design, and comparison with conventional particle filters. The comparison serves to illustrate the benefit of feedback in particle filtering.","Taghvaei, Amirhossein; Mehta, Prashant G.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.10712v1.pdf,254

In India, suspected cases were screened for SARS-CoV-2 as per the advisory of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. The objective of this study was to characterize SARS-CoV-2 sequences from three identified positive cases as on February 29, 2020. Methods: Throat swab/nasal swab specimens for a total of 881 suspected cases were screened by E gene and confirmed by RdRp (1), RdRp (2) and N gene real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reactions and next-generation sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis, molecular characterization and prediction of B- and T-cell epitopes for Indian SARS-CoV-2 sequences were undertaken. Results: Three cases with a travel history from Wuhan, China, were confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2. Almost complete (29,851 nucleotides) genomes of case 1, case 3 and a fragmented genome for case 2 were obtained. The sequences of Indian SARS-CoV-2 though not identical showed high (~99.98%) identity with Wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus (accession number: NC 045512). Phylogenetic analysis showed that the Indian sequences belonged to different clusters. Predicted linear B-cell epitopes were found to be concentrated in the S1 domain of spike protein, and a conformational epitope was identified in the receptor-binding domain. The predicted T-cell epitopes showed broad human leucocyte antigen allele coverage of A and B supertypes predominant in the Indian population. Interpretation & conclusions: The two SARS-CoV-2 sequences obtained from India represent two different introductions into the country. The genetic heterogeneity is as noted globally. The identified B- and T-cell epitopes may be considered suitable for future experiments towards the design of vaccines and diagnostics. Continuous monitoring and analysis of the sequences of new cases from India and the other affected countries would be vital to understand the genetic evolution and rates of substitution of the SARS-CoV-2.","Yadav, Pragya D; Potdar, Varsha A; Choudhary, Manohar Lal; Nyayanit, Dimpal A; Agrawal, Megha; Jadhav, Santosh M; Majumdar, Triparna D; Shete-Aich, Anita; Basu, Atanu; Abraham, Priya; Cherian, Sarah S",Indian J Med Res,,254

Patient who has CBC with RLD leads to respiratory symptoms such as breathing difficulty, airway obstruction, reduced exercise capacity and altered pulmonary functions. However, studies examining the role of pranayama breathing exercise on pulmonary function, respiratory muscle activity and exercise tolerance in full thickness circumferential burn of chest are lacking. OBJECTIVE: To find the short term effects of pranayama breathing exercise on pulmonary function, respiratory muscle activity and exercise tolerance in full thickness circumferential burns of chest. METHODS: Through simple random sampling method thirty subjects (N = 30) with RLD following CBC were allocated to pranayama breathing exercise group (PBE-G; n = 15) and conventional breathing exercise group (CBE-G; n = 15). They received pranayama breathing exercise and conventional breathing exercise for 4 weeks respectively. All the subjects received chest mobility exercise as common treatment. Primary (Numeric Pain Rating Scale - NPRS, forced expiratory volume (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC) and maximum voluntary ventilation (MVV) and secondary (Electromyogram of sternocleidomastoid, scalene, external intercostal and diaphragm muscle, 6 min walk test & Global Rating of Change - GRC) outcome measures were measured at baseline, after four weeks and after three months follow up. RESULTS: Baseline demographic and clinical variables show homogenous distribution between the groups (p > 0.05). Four weeks following different breathing exercises, PBE-G group shows more significant changes in pain intensity, pulmonary function, respiratory muscle activity, exercise tolerance and global rating of change than CBE-G group (p &#8804; 0.05) at four weeks and three months follow up. CONCLUSION: Both groups showed improvement over time. However, differences between the groups were noticed small. Still physiotherapy management, which included pranayama breathing exercises with chest mobilization program, had an effective strategy in the treatment of restrictive lung disease following circumferential burn of chest.","Nambi, Gopal; Abdelbasset, Walid Kamal; Elshehawy, Ahmed A; Altrawy, Heba H; Abodonya, Ahmed M; Saleh, Ayman K; Hussein, Ramadan S",Burns,,254

The MolPort database that contains over 100,000 NPs was screened and filtered using molecular docking techniques. Based on calculated docking scores, the top 5,000 NPs/natural-like products (NLPs) were selected and subjected to molecular dynamics (MD) simulations followed by molecular mechanics-generalized Born surface area (MM-GBSA) binding energy calculations. Combined 50 ns MD simulations and MM-GBSA calculations revealed nine potent NLPs with binding affinities (&#916;Gbinding ) > -48.0 kcal/mol. Interestingly, among the identified NLPs, four bis([1,3]dioxolo)pyran-5-carboxamide derivatives showed &#916;Gbinding > -56.0 kcal/mol, forming essential short hydrogen bonds with HIS163 and GLY143 amino acids via dioxolane oxygen atoms. Structural and energetic analyses over 50 ns MD simulation demonstrated NLP-Mpro complex stability.

COVID-19 has been associated with a number of cardiovascular complications, including arrhythmias. The aim of the current study was to evaluate P-wave dispersion (PWD) as a predictor of atrial fibrillation in patients with newly diagnosed COVID-19. In addition, the relationship between the PWD and inflammation parameters was investigated. METHODS: A total of 140 newly diagnosed COVID-19 patients and 140 age- and sex-matched healthy individuals were included in the study. The risk of atrial fibrillation was evaluated by calculating the electrocardiographic PWD. C-reactive protein (CRP), white blood cell, neutrophil and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were measured in patients with newly diagnosed COVID-19. RESULTS: PWD, white blood cell, NLR and CRP levels were significantly higher in the COVID-19 group than the control group. There was a significant positive correlation between PWD and CRP level (rsâ=â0.510, Pâ<â0.001) and NLR in COVID-19 group (rsâ=â0.302, Pâ=â0.001). In their follow-up, 13 (9.3%) patients, 11 of whom were in the ICU, developed new atrial fibrillation. CONCLUSION: Our study showed for the first time in literature that the PWD, evaluated electrocardiographically in patients with newly diagnosed COVID-19, was prolonged compared with normal healthy individuals. A positive correlation was found between PWD, CRP level and NLR. We believe that pretreatment evaluation of PWD in patients with newly diagnosed COVID-19 would be beneficial for predicting atrial fibrillation risk.","Yenerçag, Mustafa; Arslan, Ugur; Seker, Onur O; Dereli, Seçkin; Kaya, Ahmet; Dogdus, Mustafa; Öztürk, Çagatay E; Akpinar, Çetin K; Sen, Ahmet",J. cardiovasc. med.

241522,Why policy action should focus on the vulnerable commercial sex workers in Uganda during COVID-19 fight,2020,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 vaccines will become available in China soon. Understanding communities' responses to the forthcoming COVID-19 vaccines is important. We applied the theory of planned behavior as the theoretical framework. OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the prevalence of and factors associated with behavioral intention to receive self-financed or free COVID-19 vaccinations among Chinese factory workers who resumed work during the pandemic. We examined the effects of factors including sociodemographics, perceptions related to COVID-19 vaccination, exposure to information about COVID-19 vaccination through social media, and COVID-19 preventive measures implemented by individuals and factories. METHODS: Participants were full-time employees 18 years or older who worked in factories in Shenzhen. Factory workers in Shenzhen are required to receive a physical examination annually. Eligible workers attending six physical examination sites were invited to complete a survey on September 1-7, 2020. Out of 2653 eligible factory workers, 2053 (77.4%) completed the online survey. Multivariate two-level logistic regression models and ordinal logistic regression models were fitted. RESULTS: The prevalence of behavioral intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccination was 66.6% (n=1368, conditional on 80% vaccine efficacy and market rate) and 80.6% (n=1655, conditional on 80% vaccine efficacy and free vaccines). After adjusting for significant background characteristics, positive attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccination (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.20, 95% CI 1.15-1.25 and AOR 1.24, 95% CI 1.19-1.30), perceived support from significant others for getting a COVID-19 vaccination (AOR 1.43, 95% CI 1.32-1.55 and AOR 1.37, 95% CI 1.25-1.50), and perceived behavioral control to get a COVID-19 vaccination (AOR 1.51, 95% CI 1.32-1.73 and AOR 1.28, 95% CI 1.09-1.51) were positively associated with both dependent variables (conditional on 80% vaccine efficacy and market rate or free vaccines, respectively). Regarding social media influence, higher frequency of exposure to positive information related to COVID-19 vaccination was associated with a higher intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccination at market rate (AOR 1.53, 95% CI 1.39-1.70) or a free vaccination (AOR 1.52, 95% CI 1.35-1.71). Higher self-reported compliance with wearing a face mask in the workplace (AOR 1.27, 95% CI 1.02-1.58 and AOR 1.67, 95% CI 1.24-2.27) and other public spaces (AOR 1.80, 95% CI 1.42-2.29 and AOR 1.34, 95% CI 1.01-1.77), hand hygiene (AOR 1.21, 95% CI 1.00-1.47 and AOR 1.52, 95% CI 1.19-1.93), and avoiding social gatherings (AOR 1.22, 95% CI 1.01-1.47 and AOR 1.55, 95% CI 1.23-1.95) and crowded places (AOR 1.24, 95% CI 1.02-1.51 and AOR 1.73, 95% CI 1.37-2.18) were also positively associated with both dependent variables. The number of COVID-19 preventive measures implemented by the factory was positively associated with the intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccination under both scenarios (AOR 1.08, 95% CI 1.04-1.12 and AOR 1.06, 95% CI 1.01-1.11). CONCLUSIONS: Factory workers in China reported a high behavioral intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccination. The theory of planned behavior is a useful framework to guide the development of future campaigns promoting COVID-19 vaccination.","Zhang, Ke Chun; Fang, Yuan; Cao, He; Chen, Hongbiao; Hu, Tian; Chen, Yaqi; Zhou, Xiaofeng; Wang, Zixin",J Med Internet Res,,254
241912,Care for diabetes with COVID-19: Advice from China,2020,"Although the attention of the world and the global health community specifically is deservedly focused on the COVID-19 pandemic, other determinants of health continue to have large impacts and may also interact with COVID-19. Air pollution is one crucial example. Established evidence from other respiratory viruses and emerging evidence for COVID-19 specifically indicates that air pollution alters respiratory defense mechanisms leading to worsened infection severity. Air pollution also contributes to comorbidities that are known to worsen outcomes among those infected with COVID-19, and air pollution may also enhance infection transmission due to its impact on more frequent coughing. Yet despite the massive disruption of the COVID-19 pandemic, there are reasons for optimism: broad societal lockdowns have shown us a glimpse of what a future with strong air pollution measures could yield. Thus, the urgency to combat air pollution is not diminished, but instead heightened in the context of the pandemic.","Brauer, Michael; Casadei, Barbara; Harrington, Robert A; Kovacs, Richard; Sliwa, Karen",Circulation,,254

243243,Outcomes and Mortality Among Adults Hospitalized With COVID-19 at US Medical Centers,2021,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Two SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines were approved to prevent COVID-19 infection, with reported vaccine efficacy of 95%. Liver transplant (LT) recipients are at risk of lower vaccine immunogenicity and were not included in the registration trials. We assessed vaccine immunogenicity and safety in this special population. METHODS: LT recipients followed at the Tel-Aviv Sourasky Medical Center and healthy volunteers were tested for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies directed against the Spike-protein (S) and Nucleocapsid-protein (N) 10-20 days after receiving the second Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine dose. Information regarding vaccine side effects and clinical data was collected from patients and medical records. RESULTS: Eighty LT recipients were enrolled. Mean age was 60 years and 30% were female. Twenty-five healthy volunteer controls were younger (mean age 52.7 years, p = 0.013) and mostly female (68%, p = 0.002). All participants were negative for IgG N-protein serology, indicating immunity did not result from prior COVID-19 infection. All controls were positive for IgG S-protein serology. Immunogenicity among LT recipients was significantly lower with positive serology in only 47.5% (p <0.001). Antibody titer was also significantly lower in this group (mean 95.41 AU/ml vs. 200.5 AU/ml in controls, p <0.001). Predictors for negative response among LT recipients were older age, lower estimated glomerular filtration rate, and treatment with high dose steroids and mycophenolate mofetil. No serious adverse events were reported in either group. CONCLUSION: LT recipients developed substantially lower immunological response to the Pfizer-BioNTech SARS-CoV-2 mRNA-based vaccine. Factors influencing serological antibody responses include age, renal function and immunosuppressive medications. The findings require re-evaluation of vaccine regimens in this population. LAY SUMMARY: The Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine elicited substantially inferior immunity in liver transplant recipients. Less than half of the patients developed sufficient levels of antibodies against the virus, and in those who were positive, average antibody levels were 2x less compared to healthy controls. Factors predicting non-response were older age, renal function and immunosuppressive medications.","Rabinowich, Liane; Grupper, Ayelet; Baruch, Roni; Ben-Yehoyada, Merav; Halperin, Tami; Turner, Dan; Katchman, Eugene; Levi, Sharon; Houri, Inbal; Lubezky, Nir; Shibolet, Oren; Katchman, Helena",J Hepatol,,254
243255,Neurological Manifestations and their Correlated Factors in COVID-19 Patients;a Cross-Sectional Study,2021,"16 participants have been subjected to Dry Immersion model (DI) for 5 days. DI reproduces the space flight factors such as lack of support, mechanical and axial unloading, physical inactivity, elimination of vertical vascular gradient. Long-term bed rest is also associated with similar factors, so the results of the study may be useful for clinical medicine. Computer plantography and measuring the stiffness of the soft tissues of the foot and superficial muscles of the shin (mm. tibialis anterior and peroneus longus) were performed twice before DI exposure, on the 2nd and 4th days of DI exposure, as well as on the 2nd day of the recovery period. DI exposure effects the parameters under study in two ways: by raising the longitudinal arch and by flattening the transverse arch, which is accompanied by a decrease in the soft tissues stiffness of the foot and superficial muscles of the shin. The work reveals the phenomenon of compensating the longitudinal arch state by changing the characteristics that reflect the transverse arch state. The results of the study for the first time demonstrate the correlation of the foot morphological characteristics with a decrease in stiffness of mm. peroneus longus and tibialis anterior.","Saveko, Alina; Amirova, Liubov; Ermakov, Ivan; Smirnov, Yuri; Tomilovskaya, Elena; Kozlovskaya, Inesa",Sci Rep,,254

245075,Partner Violence During Pregnancy: The Role of an Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeon,2020,"AIMS: We aimed to determine the effectiveness of surveillance using testing for SARS-CoV-2 to identify an outbreak arising from a single case of border control failure in a country that has eliminated community transmission of COVID-19: New Zealand. METHODS: A stochastic version of the SEIR model CovidSIM v1.1 designed specifically for COVID-19 was utilised. It was seeded with New Zealand population data and relevant parameters sourced from the New Zealand and international literature. RESULTS: For what we regard as the most plausible scenario with an effective reproduction number of 2.0, the results suggest that 95% of outbreaks from a single imported case would be detected in the period up to day 36 after introduction. At the time point of detection, there would be a median number of five infected cases in the community (95% range: 1-29). To achieve this level of detection, an ongoing programme of 5,580 tests per day (1,120 tests per million people per day) for the New Zealand population would be required. The vast majority of this testing (96%) would be of symptomatic cases in primary care settings and the rest in hospitals. CONCLUSIONS: This model-based analysis suggests that a surveillance system with a very high level of routine testing is probably required to detect an emerging or re-emerging SARS-CoV-2 outbreak within five weeks of a border control failure in a nation that had previously eliminated COVID-19. Nevertheless, there are plausible strategies to enhance testing yield and cost-effectiveness and potential supplementary surveillance systems such as the testing of town/city sewerage systems for the pandemic virus.","Wilson, Nick; Schwehm, Markus; Verrall, Ayesha J; Parry, Matthew; Baker, Michael G; Eichner, Martin",N Z Med J,,254

245117,Love in the Time of Corona,2020,"The apextrin C-terminal (ApeC) domain is a class of newly discovered protein domains with an origin dating back to prokaryotes. ApeC-containing proteins (ACPs) have been found in various marine and aquatic invertebrates, but their functions and the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. Early studies suggested that amphioxus ACP1 and ACP2 bind to bacterial cell walls and have a role in immunity. Here we identified another two amphioxus ACPs (ACP3 and ACP5), which belong to the same phylogenetic clade with ACP1/2, but show distinct expression patterns and sequence divergence (40-50% sequence identities). Both ACP3 and ACP5 were mainly expressed in the intestine and hepatic cecum, and could be up-regulated after bacterial challenge. Both prokaryotic-expressed recombinant ACP3 and ACP5 could bind with several species of bacteria and yeasts, showing agglutinating activity but no microbicidal activity. ELISA assays suggested that their ApeC domains could interact with peptidoglycan (PGN), but not with lipoteichoic acid (LTA), lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and zymosan A. Furthermore, they can only bind to Lys-type PGN from Staphylococcus aureus, but not to DAP-type PGN from Bacillus subtilis and not to moieties of PGN such as MDPs, NAMs and NAGs. This recognition spectrum is different from that of ACP1/2. We also found that when expressed in mammalian cells, ACP3 could interact with TRAF6 via a conserved non-ApeC region, which inhibited the ubiquitination of TRAF6 and hence suppressed downstream NF-&#954;B activation. This work helped define a novel subfamily of ACPs, which have conserved structures, and have related yet diversified molecular functions. Its members have dual roles, with ApeC as a lectin and a conserved unknown region as a signal transduction regulator. These findings expand our understanding of the ACP functions and may guide future research on the role of ACPs in different animal clades.","Li, Jin; Li, Yuhui; Fan, Zhaoyu; Chen, Shenghui; Yan, Xinyu; Yue, Zirui; Huang, Guangrui; Liu, Shumin; Zhang, Hao; Chen, Shangwu; Dong, Meiling; Xu, Anlong; Huang, Shengfeng",Front Immunol,,254

And, the disease caused by the virus is named the new coronavirus disease 2019 and it will be abbreviated as 2019-nCoV and COVID-19. As of January 30, 2020, the WHO classified this epidemic as a global health emergency (Chung et al. in Radiology 295(1):202-207, 2020). It is an international real-life problem. Due to deaths, globally everyone is under fear. Now, it is the responsibility of researchers to give hope to the people. In this article, we aim to better protect people and general pandemic preparedness by predicting the lifetime of the disease-causing virus using three mathematical models. This article deals with a complex real-life problem people face all over the world, an international real-life problem. The main focus is on the USA due to large infection and death due to coronavirus and thereby the life of every individual is uncertain. The death counts of the USA from February 29 to April 22, 2020, are used in this article as a data set. The death counts of the USA are fitted by the solutions of three mathematical models and a solution to an international problem is achieved. Based on the death rate, the lifetime of the coronavirus COVID-19 is predicted as 1464.76 days from February 29, 2020. That is, after March 2024 there will be no death in the USA due to COVID-19 if everyone follows the guidelines of WHO and the advice of healthcare workers. People and government can get prepared for this situation and many lives can be saved. It is the contribution of soft computing.

There are limited data of its impact in Africa. This study aims to characterize COVID-19 response strategies and impact of COVID-19 on cancer care and explore misconceptions in Africa. METHODS: We conducted a web-based cross-sectional survey of oncology providers in Africa between June and August 2020. Descriptive statistics and comparative analysis by income groups were performed. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-two participants initiated the survey, of which 79 respondents from 18 African countries contributed data. Ninety-four percent (66 of 70) reported country mitigation and suppression strategies, similar across income groups. Unique strategies included courier service and drones for delivery of cancer medications (9 of 70 and 6 of 70, respectively). Most cancer centers remained open, but > 75% providers reported a decrease in patient volume. Not previously reported is the fear of infectivity leading to staff shortages and decrease in patient volumes. Approximately one third reported modifications of all cancer treatment modalities, resulting in treatment delays. A majority of participants reported &#8804; 25 confirmed cases (44 of 68, 64%) and &#8804; 5 deaths because of COVID-19 (26 of 45, 58%) among patients with cancer. Common misconceptions were that Africans were less susceptible to the virus (53 of 70, 75.7%) and decreased transmission of the virus in the African heat (44 of 70, 62.9%). CONCLUSION: Few COVID-19 cases and deaths were reported among patients with cancer. However, disruptions and delays in cancer care because of the pandemic were noted. The pandemic has inspired tailored innovative solutions in clinical care delivery for patients with cancer, which may serve as a blueprint for expanding care and preparing for future pandemics. Ongoing public education should address COVID-19 misconceptions.

249618,Spike in Diabetic Ketoacidosis Rates in Pediatric Type 2 Diabetes During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"Introduction La contamination des personnels soignants par le SARS-CoV-2 est une préoccupation majeure de la pandémie de COVID-19. Les principales voies de contamination sont l’inhalation de gouttelettes ou la transmission à la suite d’un contact avec des surfaces contaminées. Bien que la transmission par gouttelettes semble prédominer au niveau communautaire, l’exposition des personnels soignants dans les établissements de soins reste mal connue. Notre étude visait à évaluer les différents risques de transmission pour le personnel hospitalier prenant en charge des patients atteints d’une forme aiguë de COVID-19. Matériels et méthodes Cette étude observationnelle prospective a inclus des patients atteints par le SARS-CoV-2 et hospitalisés dans les 14 jours suivant l’apparition des symptômes. Plusieurs écouvillons ont été prélevés dans leur environnement : rebord de fenêtre, poignée de porte, ligne de perfusion, barrières de lit, dessus de table amovible, téléphone du patient, masque à oxygène ou canule nasale. Les masques portés par les agents de santé auprès des patients, soit pendant une procédure spécifique médicale ou paramédicale soit portés en continu à l’intérieur du service ont été collectés. Les masques ont été trempés dans un milieu de transport viral. La recherche de SARS-CoV-2 a été effectuée par RT-qPCR. Résultats Des écouvillons de surface ont été prélevés pour 43 patients (durée moyenne des symptômes : 8 jours). L’ARN du SARS-CoV-2 a été détecté sur toutes sortes de surfaces : barrières de lit (40%), masque à oxygène ou canule nasale (29 %), poignée de porte (28 %), dessus de table (24 %), bouton de réglage de perfusion ou pousse-seringue (10 %). Le téléphone du patient était positif dans 36 % des cas. Le rebord de la fenêtre, qui n’était pas inclus dans les procédures de bio-nettoyage, avait le taux de positivité le plus élevé : 41 %. Au total, 40 masques ont été portés par les personnels soignants après un seul geste de soin (utilisation moyenne de 8 minutes) et 40 masques portés en continu (utilisation moyenne de 211 minutes). Tous les 80 masques ont été testés négatifs pour l’ARN du SARS-COV-2, alors qu’un masque témoin porté par un patient infecté était positif. Conclusion Aucun masque de personnel soignant n’a été contaminé, même après des soins avec un risque élevé de transmission chez des patients hautement contaminants. Les surfaces les plus fréquemment touchées par les patients et les moins bio-nettoyées étaient les plus contaminées. Le principal risque de transmission à l’hôpital semble être le risque de contact. Bien que les masques semblent être correctement portés, les personnels soignants sous-estiment le risque de transmission contact, bien que majeur. Une attention particulière doit donc être portée au lavage des mains et au bio-nettoyage des surfaces.","Lomont, A.; Hassold, N.; Delagreverie, H.; Oubbea, S.; Nagle, S.; Alloui, C.; Zahar, J.; Cordel, H.",Infectious Diseases Now,,254

254110,COVID-19-Related Stress Symptoms Among Emergency Department Personnel,2021,"Little is known about the risk of hospitalization for cardiovascular disease after influenza infection in younger adults. This Hong Kong territory-wide study using clinical registry data between 1997 and 2017 examined the association between influenza-associated hospitalizations and the risk of subsequent hospitalization for heart failure (HHF) in 3 age groups: 18-44, 45-65, and >65 years. The exposure was defined as any infection with influenza virus as a primary principal diagnosis for hospitalization, whereas the non-exposed control comprised hospitalizations for elective orthopedic surgery. Logistic regression was used to determine the risk for HHF within 12 months of hospital discharge comparing the exposed versus non-exposed groups. Results showed that influenza-associated hospitalization in the preceding 12 months was associated with increased risks for subsequent HHF in all age groups (all P <0.001). Of note, the 18-44 age group was found to have the highest elevated risk for HHF (adjusted odds ratio = 14.90, 95% confidence interval: 4.48, 49.58). In view of the relatively small number of subsequent HHF episodes in this age group, future studies are needed to confirm the elevated risk in this group and explore the role of age in the relationship between influenza-associated hospitalization and subsequent HHF.","Chair, Sek Ying; Cheng, Ho Yu; Choi, Kai Chow; Fung, Erik Y M G; Siow, Elaine K C; Cao, Xi",Am. j. epidemiol,,254
255436,Mitigating the Impacts of COVID-19 on Global Child Health: a Call to Action,2021,"Introduction: The world-wide lockdown caused by Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has upended the trajectories of lives everywhere. The medical profession has been on the front lines of this rapidly developing situation, which in turn has called for unprecedented changes in the medical school curriculum. These changes have severe implications for medical students interested in applying to competitive surgical specialties like orthopedics. Methods: As medical students in 3 different class years pursuing orthopedic surgery, we provide our perspectives on the impact that COVID-19 has had on medical student orthopedic education. Results: With the removal of away rotations and a shift to virtual interviews, rising fourth year medical students are arguably the most impacted as they prepare for the orthopedic residency application process. Third year students, who are in the exploratory phase of choosing a specialty, also face uncertainties in the shift to a ""new"" clerkship experience that may (1) be of shorter duration, (2) implement shifts to limit overcrowding of clinical space, and (3) increase the use of telehealth over direct patient contact. Discussion: The COVID-19 pandemic has altered the course of medical students' orthopedic education in unprecedented ways. We believe the following suggestions may be helpful for students seeking alternative, supplemental ways of learning: (1) read up on major orthopedic journals, (2) reach out to orthopedic surgeons in areas of interest, (3) reach out to program directors/medical clerkship directors/program coordinators for opportunities to attend their educational curriculum virtually, (4) attend online lectures and hospital grand rounds, and (5) practice suturing technique with a practice kit. Conclusions: While the medical education landscape remains uncertain amid the evolving conditions of COVID-19, as medical students we strive to learn from this pandemic and respond to future unforeseen challenges with resilience, dedication, and compassion: all qualities we admire in orthopedic surgeons.","Richardson, Michelle A; Islam, Wasif; Magruder, Matthew",Geriatr Orthop Surg Rehabil,,254

A largely unexplored arena is the intrinsic tuning of VdW magnets toward new ground states. Chromium trihalides provided the first such example with a change of interlayer magnetic coupling emerging upon exfoliation. Here, we take a different approach to engineer previously unknown ground states, not by exfoliation, but by tuning the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) of the nonmagnetic ligand atoms (Cl, Br, I). We synthesize a three-halide series, CrCl3 - x - y Br x I y , and map their magnetic properties as a function of Cl, Br, and I content. The resulting triangular phase diagrams unveil a frustrated regime near CrCl3. First-principles calculations confirm that the frustration is driven by a competition between the chromium and halide SOCs. Furthermore, we reveal a field-induced change of interlayer coupling in the bulk of CrCl3 - x - y Br x I y crystals at the same field as in the exfoliation experiments.","Tartaglia, Thomas A; Tang, Joseph N; Lado, Jose L; Bahrami, Faranak; Abramchuk, Mykola; McCandless, Gregory T; Doyle, Meaghan C; Burch, Kenneth S; Ran, Ying; Chan, Julia Y; Tafti, Fazel",Sci Adv,,254

We demonstrate how to effectively incorporate environment collision avoidance as a single term in this multi-objective, optimization-based IK structure, and provide solutions for how to spatially represent and organize external environments such that data can be efficiently passed to a real-time, performance-critical optimization loop.

Healthcare workers on duty, due to overexposure in environments where there are more cases of COVID-19, are more prone to become infected by this virus. Here, we report 4 cases that meet the definition of clinical reinfection by SARS-CoV-2, as well as a literature review on this subject; all occurred in healthcare workers in Acapulco Guerrero, Mexico who provide their services in a hospital that cares for patients with COVID-19. The time between the manifestation of the first and second infection for each case was 134, 129, 107 and 82 days, all patients presented symptomatology in both events. The time between remission of the first infection and onset of second infection was 108, 109, 78 and 67 days for each case, while the time to confirmation by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) between infections was 134, 124, 106 and 77 days. In two of the four cases the reinfection resulted in a more severe case, while in the remaining two cases the manifestation of symptoms and complications was similar to that presented in the first infection. Given this scenario, greater care is needed in the management of the pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 to protect healthcare workers and the general public from risks and complications caused by a possible reinfection by SARS-CoV-2.","Garduño-Orbe, Brenda; Sánchez-Rebolledo, Juan Manuel; Cortés-Rafael, Mustafá; García-Jiménez, Yuliana; Perez-Ortiz, Marcelina; Mendiola-Pastrana, Indira Rocío; López-Ortiz, Eduardo; López-Ortiz, Geovani",Medicina (Kaunas),,254

This rapid review summarises the existing research on the determinants of behaviours that aim to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The review focuses on the body of research (excluding research conducted with health care workers) that was produced in the context of viruses other than SARS CoV-2 that cause severe respiratory illness and are transmitted in a similar way. A total of 58 published peer-reviewed studies included in the review were identified through searches of Medline, Embase, PsychInfo and CINAHL. Most were conducted in the context of the influenza A (H1N1) pandemic in 2009. Most studies examined the determinants of wearing a face covering, handwashing and social or physical distancing. The findings suggest that public health messages to encourage preventive behaviours should emphasise the potential seriousness of COVID-19 to elicit appropriate concern, strengthen perceptions of risk or threat from COVID-19, enhance self-efficacy about preventive behaviours, and improve knowledge about SARS-CoV-2, how it is transmitted, and how preventive behaviours can reduce the risk of transmission.","Hanratty, Jennifer Bradley Declan T.; Miller, Sarah J.; Dempster, Martin",Acta psychologica,,254

The conventional way of COVID-19 diagnosis is reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which is less sensitive during early stages; especially if the patient is asymptomatic, which may further cause more severe pneumonia. In this context, several deep learning models have been proposed to identify pulmonary infections using publicly available chest X-ray (CXR) image datasets for early diagnosis, better treatment and quick cure. In these datasets, presence of less number of COVID-19 positive samples compared to other classes (normal, pneumonia and Tuberculosis) raises the challenge for unbiased learning of deep learning models. All deep learning models opted class balancing techniques to solve this issue; which however should be avoided in any medical diagnosis process. Moreover, the deep learning models are also data hungry and need massive computation resources. Therefore for quicker diagnosis, this research proposes a novel pinball loss function based one-class support vector machine (PB-OCSVM), that can work in presence of limited COVID-19 positive CXR samples with objectives to maximize the learning efficiency and to minimize the false predictions. The performance of the proposed model is compared with conventional OCSVM and existing deep learning models, and the experimental results prove that the proposed model outperformed over state-of-the-art methods. To validate the robustness of the proposed model, experiments are also performed with noisy CXR images and UCI benchmark datasets.","Sonbhadra, Sanjay Kumar; Agarwal, Sonali; Nagabhushan, P.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.08115v2.pdf,254

Our society (French-speaking society of andrology, SALF) also emitted some recommendations in the andrological management of men infected by SARS-CoV-2. First, considering the fever and the potential presence of SARS-CoV2 in semen, SALF recommends waiting for 3 months (duration of one spermatogenesis cycle and epididymal transit) before re-starting ART in the case of men diagnosed COVID-19 positive. Whatever the nature of testosterone and COVID-19 relationships, we recommend an andrological examination, sperm parameters, and hormonal evaluation at the time of the COVID-19 is diagnosed, and several months later.

METHODS: In this study, we described the process of converting our MFM clinic from a conventional medical treatment model to a telemedicine platform. We compared clinical productivity between the two models. Outcomes were analysed using standard statistical tests. RESULTS: We suffered three symptomatic COVID-19 infections among our clinical providers and staff prior to the conversion, compared with none after the conversion. We had a significant decrease in patient visits following the conversion (53.35 visits per day versus 40.3 visits per day, p < 0.0001). However, our average daily patient visits per full-time equivalent (FTE) were only marginally reduced (11.1 visit per FTE versus 7.6 visits per FTE, p < 0.0001), resulting in a relative decrease in adjusted work relative value units (6987 versus 5440). There was an increase in more basic follow-up ultrasound procedures, complexity (current procedural technology [CPT] code 76816 (10.7% versus 19.5%, relative risk [RR] 1.81, 95% CI 1.60-2.05, p < 0.0001)) over comprehensive follow-up ultrasound procedures, CPT code 76805 (17.2% versus 7.8%, RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.39-0.53, p < 0.0001) after conversion. Despite similar proportions of new consults, there was an increase in the proportion of follow-up visits and medical decision-making complexity evaluation and management CPT codes (e.g. 99214/99215) after the conversion (17.2% versus 24.6%, RR 1.43, 95% CI 1.26-163, p < 0.0001). There were no differences between amniocentesis procedures performed between the two time periods (0.3% versus 0.2%, p = 0.5805). CONCLUSION: The rapid conversion of an MFM platform from convention medical treatment to telemedicine platform in response to the novel coronavirus pandemic resulted in protection of healthcare personnel and MFM patients, with only a modest decrease in clinical productivity during the initial roll-out. Due to the ongoing threat from the novel coronavirus-19, an MFM telemedicine platform is a practicable and innovative solution and merits the continued support of CMS and health care administrators.","Shields, Andrea D; Wagner, Richard K; Knutzen, Dana; Deering, Shad; Nielsen, Peter E",J Telemed Telecare,,254

In the closing 2019 to early 2020 months, the virus caused a global pandemic of COVID-19 disease. We performed a virtual screening study in order to identify potential inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 main viral protease (3CLpro or Mpro). For this purpose, we developed a novel approach using ensemble docking high-throughput virtual screening directly coupled with subsequent Linear Interaction Energy (LIE) calculations to maximize the conformational space sampling and to assess the binding affinity of identified inhibitors. A large database of small commercial compounds was prepared, and top-scoring hits were identified with two compounds singled out, namely 1-[(R)-2-(1,3-benzimidazol-2-yl)-1-pyrrolidinyl]-2-(4-methyl-1,4-diazepan-1-yl)-1-ethanone and [({(S)-1-[(1H-indol-2-yl)methyl]-3-pyrrolidinyl}methyl)amino](5-methyl-2H-pyrazol-3-yl)formaldehyde. Moreover, we obtained a favorable binding free energy of the identified compounds, and using contact analysis we confirmed their stable binding modes in the 3CLpro active site.

268800,Examination of the effect of COVID-19 on sexual dysfunction in women,2020,"While catalytic electron flow and photoreactivation of CPD-photolyases are increasingly understood, the microscopic details of the 64-photolyase repair mechanism are perpetually debated. Here, we investigate in long-time (µs) molecular dynamics simulations combined with extensive quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) simulations the primary electron transfer (ET) reactions in 64-photolyase of Drosophila melanogaster (D. melanogaster). The characterization of the relative energetics of locally excited and charge separated states in the (6-4) photoproduct enzyme repair complex reveals a charge-separated state involving the adenine moiety of the FADH- cofactor that facilitates reduction of the photoproduct. Microscopic details of the collective reaction coordinate of ET reactions are identified that involve the reorganization of the hydrogen bond network and structural relaxation of the active site. The simulations reveal complex active site relaxation dynamics involving distinguished amino acids (Lys246, His365, and His369), conformational reorganization of the hydroxyl group of the (6-4) photoproduct, and a strengthening of hydrogen bonds with immobilized water molecules. In particular, rotation of the Lys246 side chain is found to impose a double-well character along the reaction coordinate of the ET reaction. Our findings suggest that the primary ET reactions in the (6-4) photoproduct enzyme repair complex of D. melanogaster are governed by a complex multi-minima active site relaxation dynamics and potentially precede the equilibration of the protein. ET pathways mediated by the adenine moiety and the 5' side of the photoproduct are proposed to be relevant for triggering the catalytic (6-4) photoproduct reactivation.","Osswald, Mara; Fingerhut, Benjamin P",J. phys. chem.

However, several early studies support the potential role of this practice to improve oxygenation, improve clinical outcomes, and reduce the need for intensive care admission. Although there is not a set amount of time that has been proven to be optimal for awake proning, we recommend sessions of 2 to 3 hours for at least a total 4 to 5 hours a day as tolerated based on the existing data and our anecdotal experience. Despite the low-risk and low-cost nature of proning awake patients, there are still logistical concerns that may prevent adequate proning, the most significant of which is patient comfort and compliance.","Prasad, Megha; Visrodia, Kavel",Clevel. clin. j. med,,254

270701,Improving the Understanding of the Immunopathogenesis of Lymphopenia as a Correlate of SARS-CoV-2 Infection Risk and Disease Progression in African Patients: Protocol for a Cross-sectional Study,2021,"BACKGROUND: Amyloids are highly ordered polypeptide aggregates stabilized by a beta-sheet structural core. Though classically associated to pathology, reports on novel functional roles of these proteins have increasingly emerged in the past decade. Moreover, the recent discovery that amyloids formed with rationally designed small peptides can exhibit catalytic reactivity has opened up new opportunities in both biology and biotechnology. The observed activities typically require the binding of divalent metals, giving rise to active metal-amyloid complexes. METHODS: Peptide (SDIDVFI) was aggregated in vitro. The structure of the self-assembled species was analyzed using fluorescence, transmission electron microscopy, circular dichroism and computational modeling. A kinetic characterization of the emerging catalytic activity was performed. RESULTS: The peptide self-assembled into canonical amyloids that exhibited catalytic activity towards hydrolysis of the phosphoanhydride bonds of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), partially mimicking an ATPase-like enzyme. Both amyloid formation and activity are shown to depend on manganese (Mn2+) binding. The activity was not restricted to ATP but also affected all other ribonucleotides (GTP, CTP and UTP). Peptides carrying a single aspartate exhibited a similar activity. CONCLUSIONS: The phosphoanhydride bonds appear as the main specificity target of the Mn2+-amyloid complex. A single aspartate per peptide is sufficient to enable the hydrolytic activity. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Catalytic amyloids are shown for the first time to catalyze the hydrolysis of all four ribonucleotides. Our results should contribute towards understanding the biological implications of amyloid-mediated reactivity as well as in the design of future catalytic amyloids for biotechnological applications.","Castillo-Caceres, Claudio; Duran-Meza, Eva; Nova, Esteban; Araya-Secchi, Raul; Monasterio, Octavio; Diaz-Espinoza, Rodrigo",Biochim Biophys Acta Gen Subj,,254

The specific characteristics of these viruses that led to such distinct outcomes remain unclear. Here, we apply proteome-wide comparative structural analysis aiming to identify the unique molecular elements in the SARS-CoV-2 proteome that may explain the differing consequences. By combining protein modeling and molecular dynamics simulations, we suggest non-conservative substitutions in functional regions of the spike glycoprotein (S), nsp1, and nsp3 that are contributing to differences in virulence. Particularly, we explain why the substitutions at the receptor-binding domain of S affect the structure-dynamics behavior in complexes with putative host receptors. Conservation of functional protein regions within the two taxa is also noteworthy. We suggest that the highly conserved main protease, nsp5, of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 is part of their mechanism of circumventing the host interferon antiviral response. Overall, most substitutions occur on the protein surfaces and may be modulating their antigenic properties and interactions with other macromolecules. Our results imply that the striking difference in the pervasiveness of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV among humans seems to significantly derive from molecular features that modulate the efficiency of viral particles in entering the host cells and blocking the host immune response.","Prates, Erica T; Garvin, Michael R; Pavicic, Mirko; Jones, Piet; Shah, Manesh; Demerdash, Omar; Amos, B Kirtley; Geiger, Armin; Jacobson, Daniel",Mol. biol. evol,,254
276939,Re-opening Sudan: the Balance Between Maintaining Daily Living and Avoiding the Next Peak of COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection causes an acute respiratory syndrome accompanied by multi-organ damage that implicates a prothrombotic state leading to widespread microvascular clots. The causes of such coagulation abnormalities are unknown. The receptor tissue factor, also known as CD142, is often associated with cell-released extracellular vesicles (EV). In this study, we aimed to characterize surface antigens profile of circulating EV in COVID-19 patients and their potential implication as procoagulant agents. METHODS: We analyzed serum-derived EV from 67 participants who underwent nasopharyngeal swabs molecular test for suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection (34 positives and 33 negatives) and from 16 healthy controls (HC), as referral. A sub-analysis was performed on subjects who developed pneumonia (n = 28). Serum-derived EV were characterized for their surface antigen profile and tested for their procoagulant activity. A validation experiment was performed pre-treating EV with anti-CD142 antibody or with recombinant FVIIa. Serum TNF-&#945; levels were measured by ELISA. FINDINGS: Profiling of EV antigens revealed a surface marker signature that defines circulating EV in COVID-19. A combination of seven surface molecules (CD49e, CD209, CD86, CD133/1, CD69, CD142, and CD20) clustered COVID (+) versus COVID (-) patients and HC. CD142 showed the highest discriminating performance at both multivariate models and ROC curve analysis. Noteworthy, we found that CD142 exposed onto surface of EV was biologically active. CD142 activity was higher in COVID (+) patients and correlated with TNF-&#945; serum levels. INTERPRETATION: In SARS-CoV-2 infection the systemic inflammatory response results in cell-release of substantial amounts of procoagulant EV that may act as clotting initiation agents, contributing to disease severity.

In this study, we aimed to determine the prevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies in health care and hospital workers (HCHWs) and assess how antibody levels change over time. METHODS: Cross-sectional study of employed HCHWs at a freestanding, urban pediatric tertiary care hospital. Employed HCHWs &#8805;18 years old who were asymptomatic and worked in clinical hospital locations were eligible to participate. Participants completed blood draws and surveys at baseline (between May 4, 2020, and June 2, 2020) and 2 months later (between July 6, 2020, and August 7, 2020). Surveys collected demographic information, SARS-CoV-2 exposures, and previous COVID-19 diagnosis. RESULTS: In total, 530 participants enrolled in and completed baseline study activities. The median age was 37 years (range 19-67 years); 86% identified as female, and 80% identified as white. Two months later, 481 (91%) HCHWs completed another survey and blood draw. Four of 5 (0.9%) seropositive subjects at baseline remained seropositive at 2 months, although 3 had decreasing IgG indices. Five (1.0%) seropositive individuals, including 4 who were previously seropositive and 1 newly seropositive, were detected 2 months later. History of positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction testing results (P < .001) and history of COVID-19 exposure (P < .001) were associated with presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected in 1% of HCHWs in an urban pediatric hospital in a city with moderate SARS-CoV-2 prevalence. Participants with a known previous COVID-19 diagnosis showed a decline or loss of IgG antibodies over 2 months. These results have implications for identifying those with previous exposure and for ongoing public health recommendations for ensuring workplace safety.","Tokareva, Yekaterina; Englund, Janet A; Dickerson, Jane A; Brown, Julie C; Zerr, Danielle M; Walter, Emily; Tsogoo, Ariundari; Cappetto, Kaitlin; Valdez Gonzalez, Jaqueline; Strelitz, Bonnie; Klein, Eileen J",Hosp. pediatr.

279564,COVID-19 and Diabetes: What Should We Expect?,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Compression of the cauda equina can lead to bladder, bowel and sexual dysfunction with lower limb pain, numbness and weakness. Urgent surgical decompression aims to prevent progressive neurological deficit. Symptoms of cauda equina syndrome (CES), such as back pain, sciatica and bladder dysfunction are common in the population, but the majority of those investigated do not have radiological cauda equina compression. However, a missed diagnosis can have significant medical, social and legal consequences. We investigated the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on presentation and management of suspected CES. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study analysed referral, investigation and treatment of CES in a regional neurosurgical centre during the initial COVID-19 surge between March and May 2020 compared with March to May 2019. RESULTS: Referrals for suspected CES were similar during the COVID-19 pandemic (n = 275) compared with 2019 (n = 261, p = 0.596) despite a significant (19%) decrease in total emergency neurosurgical referrals (1248 in 2020 vs 1544 in 2019, p < 0.001). Nineteen (7%) of the suspected CES referrals underwent decompression in 2020, similar to 16 (6%) in 2019 (p = 0.867). There were no differences in outcomes or complications and no evidence of delays in presentation or treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Unlike other emergency neurosurgical conditions, the number of referrals for suspected CES and the percentage of referrals with radiological cauda equina compression were unchanged during the COVID-19 pandemic. The persistence of CES referrals when many people stayed away from hospital highlights the distress and worry caused by suspected CES and its symptoms to both patients and healthcare providers.","Woodfield, J; Brennan, P M; Statham, Pfx; Stone, J; Hoeritzauer, I",Ann.

280821,It's Time to Resolve the Direct Care Workforce Crisis in Long-Term Care,2020,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The degree to which the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected systems of care, in particular, those for time-sensitive conditions such as stroke, remains poorly quantified. We sought to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 in the overall screening for acute stroke utilizing a commercial clinical artificial intelligence platform. METHODS: Data were derived from the Viz Platform, an artificial intelligence application designed to optimize the workflow of patients with acute stroke. Neuroimaging data on suspected patients with stroke across 97 hospitals in 20 US states were collected in real time and retrospectively analyzed with the number of patients undergoing imaging screening serving as a surrogate for the amount of stroke care. The main outcome measures were the number of computed tomography (CT) angiography, CT perfusion, large vessel occlusions (defined according to the automated software detection), and severe strokes on CT perfusion (defined as those with hypoperfusion volumes >70 mL) normalized as number of patients per day per hospital. Data from the prepandemic (November 4, 2019 to February 29, 2020) and pandemic (March 1 to May 10, 2020) periods were compared at national and state levels. Correlations were made between the inter-period changes in imaging screening, stroke hospitalizations, and thrombectomy procedures using state-specific sampling. RESULTS: A total of 23 223 patients were included. The incidence of large vessel occlusion on CT angiography and severe strokes on CT perfusion were 11.2% (n=2602) and 14.7% (n=1229/8328), respectively. There were significant declines in the overall number of CT angiographies (-22.8%; 1.39-1.07 patients/day per hospital, P<0.001) and CT perfusion (-26.1%; 0.50-0.37 patients/day per hospital, P<0.001) as well as in the incidence of large vessel occlusion (-17.1%; 0.15-0.13 patients/day per hospital, P<0.001) and severe strokes on CT perfusion (-16.7%; 0.12-0.10 patients/day per hospital, P<0.005). The sampled cohort showed similar declines in the rates of large vessel occlusions versus thrombectomy (18.8% versus 19.5%, P=0.9) and comprehensive stroke center hospitalizations (18.8% versus 11.0%, P=0.4). CONCLUSIONS: A significant decline in stroke imaging screening has occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic.

This study examined both D2B and clinical outcomes of patients with STEMI undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI).MethodsâandâResults:This was a retrospective study of 303 STEMI patients who presented directly or were transferred to a tertiary hospital in Singapore for PPCI from October 2019 to March 2020. We compared the clinical outcomes of patients admitted before (BOR) and during (DOR) the COVID-19 outbreak response. The study outcomes were in-hospital death, D2B, cardiogenic shock and 30-day readmission. For direct presentations, fewer patients in the DOR group achieved D2B time <90 min compared with the BOR group (71.4% vs. 80.9%, P=0.042). This was more apparent after exclusion of non-system delay cases (DOR 81.6% vs. BOR 95.9%, P=0.006). Prevalence of both out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (9.5% vs. 1.9%, P=0.003) and acute mitral regurgitation (31.6% vs. 17.5%, P=0.006) was higher in the DOR group. Mortality was similar between groups. Multivariable regression showed that longer D2B time was an independent predictor of death (odds ratio 1.005, 95% confidence interval 1.000-1.011, P=0.029). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic and the outbreak response have had an adverse effect on PPCI service efficiency.

280925,Relative infectiousness of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infected persons compared with symptomatic individuals: a rapid scoping review,2021,"Emerging outbreaks of airborne pathogenic infections worldwide, such as the current severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, have raised the need to understand parameters affecting the airborne survival of microbes in order to develop measures for effective infection control. We report a novel experimental strategy, TAMBAS (tandem approach for microphysical and biological assessment of airborne microorganism survival), to explore the synergistic interactions between the physicochemical and biological processes that impact airborne microbe survival in aerosol droplets. This innovative approach provides a unique and detailed understanding of the processes taking place from aerosol droplet generation through to equilibration and viability decay in the local environment, elucidating decay mechanisms not previously described. The impact of evaporation kinetics, solute hygroscopicity and concentration, particle morphology, and equilibrium particle size on airborne survival are reported, using Escherichia coli MRE162 as a benchmark system. For this system, we report that (i) particle crystallization does not directly impact microbe longevity, (ii) bacteria act as crystallization nuclei during droplet drying and equilibration, and (iii) the kinetics of size and compositional change appear to have a larger effect on microbe longevity than the equilibrium solute concentration.IMPORTANCE A transformative approach to identify the physicochemical processes that impact the biological decay rates of bacteria in aerosol droplets is described. It is shown that the evaporation process and changes in the phase and morphology of the aerosol particle during evaporation impact microorganism viability. The equilibrium droplet size was found to affect airborne bacterial viability. Furthermore, the presence of Escherichia coli MRE162 in a droplet does not affect aerosol growth/evaporation but influences the dynamic behavior of the aerosol by processing the culture medium prior to aerosolization, affecting the hygroscopicity of the culture medium; this highlights the importance of the inorganic and organic chemical composition within the aerosolized droplets that impact hygroscopicity. Bacteria also act as crystallization nuclei. The novel approach and data have implications for increased mechanistic understanding of aerosol survival and infectivity in bioaerosol studies spanning the medical, veterinary, farming, and agricultural fields, including the role of microorganisms in atmospheric processing and cloud formation.","Otero Fernandez, Mara; Thomas, Richard J; Oswin, Henry; Haddrell, Allen E; Reid, Jonathan P",,,254

282784,"Respiratory Support in COVID-19 Patients, with a Focus on Resource-Limited Settings",2020,"COVID-19 cases are exponentially increasing worldwide; however, its clinical phenotype remains unclear. Natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning approaches may yield key methods to rapidly identify individuals at a high risk of COVID-19 and to understand key symptoms upon clinical manifestation and presentation. Data on such symptoms may not be accurately synthesized into patient records owing to the pressing need to treat patients in overburdened health care settings. In this scenario, clinicians may focus on documenting widely reported symptoms that indicate a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, albeit at the expense of infrequently reported symptoms. While NLP solutions can play a key role in generating clinical phenotypes of COVID-19, they are limited by the resulting limitations in data from electronic health records (EHRs). A comprehensive record of clinic visits is required-audio recordings may be the answer. A recording of clinic visits represents a more comprehensive record of patient-reported symptoms. If done at scale, a combination of data from the EHR and recordings of clinic visits can be used to power NLP and machine learning models, thus rapidly generating a clinical phenotype of COVID-19. We propose the generation of a pipeline extending from audio or video recordings of clinic visits to establish a model that factors in clinical symptoms and predict COVID-19 incidence. With vast amounts of available data, we believe that a prediction model can be rapidly developed to promote the accurate screening of individuals at a high risk of COVID-19 and to identify patient characteristics that predict a greater risk of a more severe infection. If clinical encounters are recorded and our NLP model is adequately refined, benchtop virologic findings would be better informed. While clinic visit recordings are not the panacea for this pandemic, they are a low-cost option with many potential benefits, which have recently begun to be explored.","Barr, Paul J; Ryan, James; Jacobson, Nicholas C",J Med Internet Res,,254

Com base em estudos anteriores, a atual classificação taxonômica da espécie apresenta inconsistências, que sugerem a presença de mais de uma espécie dentro do que hoje é classificado como M. nemorivaga. Desta forma, o presente trabalho tem como objetivo contribuir com a taxonomia do gênero Mazama, mediante a coleta de um exemplar em sua localidade tipo (Caiena, Guiana Francesa), caracterizando-o morfológica, citogenética e molecularmente, permitindo a comparação da espécie em estudo com outros espécimes utilizados em publicações, a fim de conhecer diferenças entre eles e revisar a taxonomia da espécie. Para tanto, foi coletado um exemplar na localidade tipo da espécie (Guiana Francesa), caraterizado por técnicas de morfologia tradicional (medidas crânio-mandibulares, medidas biométricas, coloração da pele), morfologia geométrica, assim como análises citogenéticas (Banda G, Banda C, coloração convencional de Giemsa e coloração Ag-NOR, FISH telomérica) e moleculares (análises filogenéticas de genes mitocôndrias Cyt b de 920 pb, COI I de 658 pb, D-loop 610 pb). Os resultados da caracterização citogenética e molecular, mostraram um claro agrupamento do topótipo de M. nemorivaga junto com exemplares da região do Amapá, constituindo o clado Norte (Guiana Francesa e Amapá). Além disso, sugere-se a existência de três espécies distintas, com base no nível de diferenças em relação ao topótipo da espécie, uma ocorrendo na Amazônia oriental, acima do rio Amazonas (Amapá e Guiana Francesa), outra na Amazônia central (Mato Grosso, Pará e Maranhão) e uma outra na Amazônia ocidental (Acre e Rondônia). Além disso, foi identificada a presença de pelos na região tarsal como um dos carácteres morfológicos que pode ser utilizado na diagnose da espécie em relação ao outros membros do gênero.

Picnodisostosis is a rare autosomal recessive lysosomal disease (1.7/million inhabitants) characterized by osteosclerosis, short stature and bone fragility and evidenced radiologically by increased bone density with permeable medular canal persistence. Due to a mutation in the gene encoding for catepsin K (1q21), enzyme responsible for the division of proteins in the bone matrix (type 1 collagen, osteonectin and osteopontin), presenting bone fragility with increased consolidation time. Diagnosis of picnodystosis was made clinically by the presence of Wormian bones in the skull, micrognathia, clavicular hypoplasia, acroosteolysis, osteosclerosis and increased bone density in long bones. Open reduction and internal fixation with tibia LCP plate was carried out, with surveillance for three months with monthly radiographic controls. The healing of the fracture was achieved within 3 months of the surgical event with reintegration into its normal activities at the same time. Picnodisostosis is a rare disease with special bone characteristics that merits treatment with special plate for osteoporotic bones obtaining good results in an acceptable time.","Mercado-Colín, J M; Robiou-Vivero, E J A",Acta Ortop Mex,,254

288001,Emergency Department and Overcrowding During COVID-19 Outbreak;a Letter to Editor,2021,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Systemic inflammation has been reported as a new predictor for COVID-19 outcomes. Thus, we hypothesized that ICU patients infected by COVID-19 had lower blood vitamin D levels and increased systemic inflammation. Therefore, this is the first Brazilian study to evaluate the vitamin D concentrations and NLR as a systemic inflammation in patients infected by COVID-19 admitted in ICU. METHODS: This cross-sectional study selected twenty-six patients from COVID-19 Data Sharing/FAPESP, Brazil. Twenty-five patients were enrolled from a single hospital and those with blood vitamin D and neutrophil and lymphocyte data were included and had all available data analyzed. Patients were divided in two groups: low vitamin D concentration when &#8804;20 ng/mL (low Vit D group, n = 8, 5M/3F, 62.7 ± 8.4 years old), and normal vitamin D when > 20 ng/mL (normal Vit D group, n = 17, 9M/8F, 74 ± 8.2 years old). Serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin D, C reactive protein (CRP), and count of neutrophils and lymphocytes concentrations were collected from COVID-19 Data Sharing/FAPESP. Statistical analyses were performed using the Prism version 5.0 and Student T test was applied to verify any difference between the groups. RESULTS: Low vitamin D group had 15.5 ± 3.3 ng/mL of 25OH Vit D concentrations and normal vitamin D group had 35.9 ± 8.8 ng/mL. Although no difference between groups for CRP concentrations (low Vit D: 4.5 ± 3.3 vs. normal Vit D: 4.2 ± 4.0 mg/dL, p = 0.45), we found higher neutrophil count and NLR values in the low Vit D group when compared to normal Vit D group (low Vit D: 6049.8 ± 3719.7 vs. normal Vit D: 3741.8 ± 1704.1 ng/mL, p = 0.02) and (low Vit D: 9.0 ± 8.6 vs. normal Vit D: 4.2 ± 4.0 ng/mL, p = 0.03), respectively. CONCLUSION: This data sharing-derived cases of COVID-19 in patients admitted at ICU showed that patients infected by COVID-19 had lower serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D and enhanced systemic inflammation when assessed by NLR values.","Pimentel, Gustavo D; Dela Vega, Maria C M; Pichard, Claude",Clin Nutr ESPEN,,254

288791,Establishment of an Alternate Care Site (ACS) in Imperial County During COVID-19,2021,"When the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) was established in 1988, an estimated 350,000 poliomyelitis cases were reported worldwide. In 2020, 140 wild poliovirus (WPV) cases were confirmed, representing a 99.99% reduction since 1988. WPV type 1 transmission remains endemic in only two countries (Pakistan and Afghanistan), but outbreaks of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV) occurred in 33 countries during 2019-2020 (1,2). Poliovirus transmission is detected primarily through syndromic surveillance for acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) among children aged <15 years, with confirmation by laboratory testing of stool specimens. Environmental surveillance supplements AFP surveillance and plays an increasingly important role in detecting poliovirus transmission. Within 2 weeks of COVID-19 being declared a global pandemic (3), GPEI recommended continuing surveillance activities with caution and paused all polio supplementary immunization activities (4). This report summarizes surveillance performance indicators for 2019 and 2020 in 42 priority countries at high risk for poliovirus transmission and updates previous reports (5). In 2020, 48% of priority countries* in the African Region, 90% in the Eastern Mediterranean Region, and 40% in other regions met AFP surveillance performance indicators nationally. The number of priority countries rose from 40 in 2019 to 42 in 2020. Analysis of 2019-2020 AFP surveillance data from 42 countries at high risk for poliovirus transmission indicates that national and subnational nonpolio AFP rates and stool specimen adequacy declined in many priority countries, particularly in the African Region, suggesting a decline in surveillance sensitivity and quality. The findings in this report can be used to guide improvements to restore a sensitive surveillance system that can track poliovirus transmission and provide evidence of interruption of transmission.","Tuma, Jude N; Wilkinson, Amanda L; Diop, Ousmane M; Jorba, Jaume; Gardner, Tracie; Snider, Cynthia J; Anand, Abhijeet; Ahmed, Jamal",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,254

Our base case was a 45-year-old female with diabetes and a body mass index of 45 kg/m2. We compared immediate with delayed surgery after 6 months to allow for COVID-19 prevalence to decrease. We found that immediate and delayed bariatric surgeries after 6 months resulted in similar 20-year overall survival. When the probability of COVID-19 infection exceeded 4%, then delayed surgery improved survival. If future COVID-19 infection rates were at least half those in the immediate scenario, then immediate surgery was favored and local infection rates had to exceed 9% before surgical delay improved survival. Surgeons should consider local disease prevalence and patient comorbidities associated with increased mortality before resuming bariatric surgery programs.","Shipe, Maren E; Beeghly-Fadiel, Alicia; Deppen, Stephen A; English, Wayne; Grogan, Eric L",Obes. surg,,254

We found that the AHC narrative elicited significantly greater pro-conservation policy support, especially for bans in the commercial trade of wildlife, when compared to the control group. Possible mechanisms driving this effect are that AHC narratives were less familiar, elicited higher mental and emotional engagement, and induced feelings that firms and governments are responsible for mitigating wildlife extinction.","Shreedhar, Ganga; Mourato, Susana",Environ Resour Econ (Dordr),,254

292666,A trend towards an early increase in ketoacidosis at presentation of paediatric type 1 diabetes during the coronavirus-2019 pandemic,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Cardiopulmonary arrest (CPA) is the acute cessation of systemic perfusion and ventilation. It leads to a lack of tissue oxygen delivery and, if not addressed quickly, will inevitably cause death. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is the only available treatment for CPA and several opportunities exist to improve the veterinary team's resuscitation approach and optimize small animal CPR patient outcomes. In 2012, the Reassessment Campaign on Veterinary Resuscitation (RECOVER) initiative generated evidence-based clinical guidelines to form the basis for training and practice of CPR in dogs and cats. When employing an evidence-based, standardized approach to small animal CPR, return of spontaneous circulation can be achieved in up to 58% of patients and up to 7% of dogs and 19% of cats can be discharged from the veterinary hospital alive. Survival for dogs and cats that suffer CPA is best in patients that suffer a peri-anesthetic arrest, so high quality CPR in the anesthesia patient population is of utmost importance and expected to be the most rewarding. To ensure the best possible outcomes for any patient suffering from CPA and undergoing CPR, a comprehensive resuscitation strategy is necessary, that includes preventive and preparedness measures, basic life support (chest compressions and ventilation), advanced life support (optimization of the patient status by targeted drug therapy, cardiac rhythm monitoring, and defibrillation), and post-cardiac arrest critical care. This article summarizes the most important RECOVER CPR guidelines for the small animal practitioner.","Hoehne, S; Kruppert, A; Boller, M",Schweiz Arch Tierheilkd,,254

The Asian National Cancer Centres Alliance and the Asia-Pacific Organisation for Cancer Prevention collaborated to assess the mid- and long- term impact of COVID-19 to cancer care in Asia. METHODS: The two entities organised a combined symposium and post-meeting interactions among representatives of major cancer centres from seventeen Asian countries to outlining major challenges and countermeasures. RESULTS: Participating stakeholders distilled five big questions. 1) ""Will there be an explosion of late-stage cancers after the pandemic?"" To address and recover from perceived delayed prevention, screening, treatment and care challenges, collaboration of key stakeholders in the region and alignment in cancer care management, policy intervention and cancer registry initiatives would be of essential value. 2) ""Operations and Finance"" The pandemic has resulted in significant material and financial casualties. Flagged acute challenges (shortages of supplies, imposition of lockdown) as well as longer-standing reduction of financial revenue, manpower, international collaboration, and training should also be addressed. 3) ""Will telemedicine and technological innovations revolutionize cancer care?"" Deploying and implementing telemedicine such as teleconsultation and virtual tumour boards were considered invaluable. These innovations could become a new regular practice, leading to expansion of tele-collaboration through collaboration of institutions in the region. 4) ""Will virtual conferences continue after the pandemic?"" Virtual conferences during the pandemic have opened new doors for knowledge sharing, especially for representatives of low- and middle-income countries in the region, while saving time and costs of travel. 5) ""How do we prepare for the next pandemic or international emergency?"" Roadmaps for action to improve access to appropriate patient care and research were identified and scrutinised. CONCLUSION: Through addressing these five big questions, focused collaboration among members and with international organisations such as City Cancer Challenge will allow enhanced preparedness for future international emergencies.<br />.","Gatellier, Laureline; Shankar, Abhishek; Dewi, Luh K Mela; Hussain, Quazi Mushtaq; Dendup Wangdi, Tashi; Sukumaran, Dato Babu; Sari, Nina Kemala; Tavakkoli Shiraji, Sahar; Biglari, Mohammad; Tahmasebi, Mamak; Iwata, Satoshi; Suzuki, Tatsuya; Myung, Seung-Kwon; Chun, June Young; Han, Jong Soo; Lau, Fen Nee; Yusak, Suhana; Bayarsaikhan, Luvsandorj; Mu, Khin Thin; Pradhananga, Kishore K; Yusuf, Aasim; Lin, Ching-Hung; Chiang, Ruru Chun-Ju; Sangrajran, Suleeporn; Nguyen, Quang Tien; Huong, Giang Nguyen; Soe, Aung Naing; Sharma, D N; Sengar, Manju; Pramesh, C S; Matsuda, Tomohiro; Jarrahi, Alireza Mosavi; Hwang, William",Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,,254

We aimed to explore the predictive value of clinical, laboratory and CT imaging characteristics on admission for short-term outcomes of COVID-19 patients. Methods: This multicenter, retrospective, observation study enrolled 703 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to 16 tertiary hospitals from 8 provinces in China between January 10, 2020 and March 13, 2020. Demographic, clinical, laboratory data, CT imaging findings on admission and clinical outcomes were collected and compared. The primary endpoint was in-hospital death, the secondary endpoints were composite clinical adverse outcomes including in-hospital death, admission to intensive care unit (ICU) and requiring invasive mechanical ventilation support (IMV). Multivariable Cox regression, Kaplan-Meier plots and log-rank test were used to explore risk factors related to in-hospital death and in-hospital adverse outcomes.

In January of 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a pandemic owing to its global spread. Because no studies have investigated COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia, this study investigated similarities and differences between demographic data during the COVID-19 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreaks in Saudi Arabia. A retrospective trend analysis was performed to assess demographic data of all laboratory-confirmed MERS and COVID-19 cases. Patients' charts were reviewed for data on demographics, mortality, citizenship, sex ratio, and age groups with descriptive and comparative statistics; the data were analyzed using a non-parametric binomial test and chi-square test. Of all COVID-19 patients in Saudi Arabia,78%were male patients and 22% were female patients. This proportion of male COVID-19 patients was similar to that of male MERS patients, which also affected male patients more frequently than female patients. The number of COVID-19-positive Saudi cases was lower than that of non-Saudi cases, which were in contrast to that of MERS; COVID-19 appeared to be remarkably similar to MERS with respect to recovered cases. However, the numbers of critical and dead COVID-19 patients have been much lower than those of MERS patients. The largest proportion of COVID-19 and MERS cases (44.05% and 40.8%, respectively) were recorded in the Western region. MERS and COVID-19 exhibited similar threats to the lives of adults and the elderly, despite lower mortality rates during the COVID-19 epidemic. Targeted prevention of and interventions against MERS should be allocated populations according to the areas where they inhabit.

Preliminary statements addressing clinical questions related to MIS-C and hyperinflammation in COVID-19 were developed based on evidence reports. Consensus was built through a modified Delphi process that involved anonymous voting and discussion through webinars. A 9-point scale was used to determine the appropriateness of each statement (1-3, inappropriate; 4-6, uncertain; 7-9, appropriate), and consensus was rated as low (L), moderate (M), or high (H) based on dispersion of the votes along the numeric scale. Approved guidance statements had to be classified as appropriate with moderate or high levels of consensus, which were pre-specified prior to voting. RESULTS: The first version of the guidance was approved by the Task Force in June 2020 and consisted of 40 final guidance statements accompanied by a flow diagram depicting the diagnostic pathway for MIS-C. The document was revised in November 2020, and a new flow diagram with recommendations for initial immunomodulatory treatment of MIS-C was added. CONCLUSION: Our understanding of SARS-CoV-2-related syndromes in the pediatric population continues to evolve. This guidance document reflects currently available evidence coupled with expert opinion but is meant to be modified as additional data become available.","Henderson, Lauren A; Canna, Scott W; Friedman, Kevin G; Gorelik, Mark; Lapidus, Sivia K; Bassiri, Hamid; Behrens, Edward M; Ferris, Anne; Kernan, Kate F; Schulert, Grant S; Seo, Philip; Son, Mary Beth F; Tremoulet, Adriana H; Yeung, Rae S M; Mudano, Amy S; Turner, Amy S; Karp, David R; Mehta, Jay J",Arthritis rheumatol.

302651,Hypoalbuminemia in COVID-19: assessing the hypothesis for underlying pulmonary capillary leakage,2021,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) persists on stainless steel and plastic for up to 7 days, suggesting that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) could be spread by fomite transmission. There is limited research on the stability of SARS-CoV-2 on textiles, with the risk of textiles acting as fomites not being well understood. To date, there does not appear to be any published research on the stability of coronaviruses during laundering, which is required to determine the efficacy of current laundering policies in the decontamination of health care textiles. The aim of this study was to investigate the environmental stability of human coronaviruses HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E on different textile fiber types and the persistence of HCoV-OC43 on textiles during domestic and industrial laundering. This study demonstrated that human coronaviruses (5 log10 50% tissue culture infective doses [TCID50]) remain infectious on polyester for &#8805;72 h, cotton for &#8805;24 h, and polycotton for &#8805;6 h; HCoV-OC43 was also able to transfer from polyester to PVC or polyester after 72 h. Under clean conditions, HCoV-OC43 was not detectable on cotton swatches laundered with industrial and domestic wash cycles without temperature and detergent (&#8805;4.57-log10-TCID50 reduction), suggesting that the dilution and agitation of wash cycles are sufficient to remove human coronaviruses from textiles. In the presence of interfering substances (artificial saliva), &#8804;1.78 log10 TCID50 HCoV-OC43 was detected after washing domestically without temperature and detergent, unlike industrial laundering, where the virus was completely removed. However, no infectious HCoV-OC43 was detected when washed domestically with detergent.IMPORTANCE Synthetic textiles such as polyester could potentially act as fomites of human coronaviruses, indicating the importance of infection control procedures during handling of contaminated textiles prior to laundering. This study provides novel evidence that human coronaviruses can persist on textiles for up to 3 days and are readily transferred from polyester textile to other surfaces after 72 h of incubation. This is of particular importance for the domestic laundering of contaminated textiles such as health care uniforms in the United Kingdom and United States, where there may be a risk of cross-contaminating the domestic environment. It was demonstrated that human coronaviruses are removed from contaminated textiles by typical domestic and commercial wash cycles, even at low temperatures without detergent, indicating that current health care laundering policies are likely sufficient in the decontamination of SARS-CoV-2 from textiles.","Owen, Lucy; Shivkumar, Maitreyi; Laird, Katie",MSphere,,254

OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to compare the test characteristics of point-of-care lung ultrasound (LUS) with chest x-ray study (CXR) at radiographically detecting COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: This was a single-center, prospective, observational study at an urban university hospital with > 105,000 patient visits annually. Patients &#8805; 18 years old, who presented to the Emergency Department with predefined signs and symptoms of COVID-19, were eligible for enrollment. Each patient received an LUS using a portable, handheld ultrasound followed by a single-view, portable anteroposterior CXR. Patients with an abnormal LUS or CXR underwent a non-contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan (NCCT). The primary outcome was the radiographic diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia on NCCT. RESULTS: One hundred ten patients underwent LUS, CXR, and NCCT; 99 LUS and 73 CXRs were interpreted as positive; 81 NCCTs were interpreted as positive, providing a prevalence of COVID-19 pneumonia of 75% (95% confidence interval [CI] 66-83.2) in our study population. LUS sensitivity was 97.6% (95% CI 91.6-99.7) vs. 69.9% (95% CI 58.8-79.5) for CXR. LUS specificity was 33.3% (95% CI 16.5-54) vs. 44.4% (95% CI 25.5-64.7) for CXR. LUS positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 81.8% (95% CI 72.8-88.9) and 81.8% (95% CI 48.2-97.7), respectively, vs. 79.5% (95% CI 68.4-88), and 32.4% (95% CI 18-49.8), respectively, for CXR. CONCLUSION: LUS was more sensitive than CXR at radiographically identifying COVID-19 pneumonia.","Gibbons, Ryan C; Magee, Mark; Goett, Harry; Murrett, James; Genninger, Jessica; Mendez, Kendra; Tripod, Matthew; Tyner, Nicholas; Costantino, Thomas G",J Emerg Med,,254
304634,COVID-19 Conferences: Resident Perceptions of Online Synchronous Learning Environments,2020,"BACKGROUND: Early pubertal maturation has been posited to be a biopsychosocial risk factor for the onset of internalizing psychopathology in adolescence; further, early-maturing youths exhibit heightened reactivity to stressful events. School closures and enforced social distancing, as well as health and financial uncertainties, during the COVID-19 pandemic are expected to adversely affect mental health in youths, particularly adolescents who are already at risk for experiencing emotional difficulties. The executive control network (ECN) supports cognitive processes required to successfully navigate novel challenges and regulate emotions in stressful contexts. METHODS: We examined whether functional coherence of the ECN, measured using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging 5 years before the pandemic (T1), is a neurobiological marker of resilience to increases in the severity of internalizing symptoms during COVID-19 in adolescents who were in more advanced stages of puberty at T1 relative to their same-age peers (N = 85, 49 female). RESULTS: On average, participants reported an increase in symptoms from the 3 months before pandemic to the 2 most recent weeks during the pandemic. We found that early-maturing youths exhibited greater increases in internalizing symptoms during the pandemic if their ECN coherence was low; in contrast, relative pubertal stage was not associated with changes in internalizing symptoms in adolescents with higher ECN coherence at T1. CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the role of the functional architecture of the brain that supports executive functioning in protecting against risk factors that may exacerbate symptoms of internalizing psychopathology during periods of stress and uncertainty.","Chahal, Rajpreet; Kirshenbaum, Jaclyn S; Miller, Jonas G; Ho, Tiffany C; Gotlib, Ian H",Biol.

305030,'A multifaceted virus. Non-reducible and strangulated effects of COVID-19',2021,"Here a bioinformatic pipeline VVV has been developed to analyse viral populations in a given sample from Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) data. To date, handling large amounts of data from NGS requires the expertise of bioinformaticians, both for data processing and result analysis. Consequently, VVV was designed to help non-bioinformaticians to perform these tasks. By providing only the NGS data file, the developed pipeline generated consensus sequences and determined the composition of the viral population for an avian Metapneumovirus (AMPV) and three different animal coronaviruses (Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus (PEDV), Turkey Coronavirus (TCoV) and Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV)). In all cases, the pipeline produced viral consensus genomes corresponding to known consensus sequence and made it possible to highlight the presence of viral genetic variants through a single graphic representation. The method was validated by comparing the viral populations of an AMPV field sample, and of a copy of this virus produced from a DNA clone. VVV demonstrated that the cloned virus population was homogeneous (as designed) at position 2934 where the wild-type virus demonstrated two variant populations at a ratio of almost 50:50. A total of 18, 10, 3 and 28, viral genetic variants were detected for AMPV, PEDV, TCoV and IBV respectively. The simplicity of this pipeline makes the study of viral genetic variants more accessible to a wide variety of biologists, which should ultimately increase the rate of understanding of the mechanisms of viral genetic evolution.","Flageul, Alexandre; Lucas, Pierrick; Hirchaud, Edouard; Touzain, Fabrice; Blanchard, Yannick; Eterradossi, Nicolas; Brown, Paul; Grasland, Béatrice",Virus Res,,254

(identifying discontents such as daily inefficiencies and intraprofessional loss of trust);2) Adaptation , or ""who are we now?"" (exploring affordances and limitations of virtual work, and the evolution of personal and professional identity);and 3) Reimagination , or ""who will we become?""

Fifty-two healthcare professionals (nurses, midwives, and residents) who provide medical care directly to COVID-19-positive patients in inpatient clinics or intensive care units were enrolled in this study. Serum AMH levels were analyzed to reflect ovarian reserve. The Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-S and STAI-T, respectively) were completed by participants to assess their anxiety status. A linear regression model with participant age as the constant variable was applied to analyze the relationship between inventory scale scores and AMH levels. P-values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. The mean AMH value was significantly lower for the participants in the moderate/severe anxiety group compared to the minimal/mild anxiety group (p = 0.007). A linear regression analysis revealed a significant negative correlation between AMH levels and both BAI (B = -0.030, standard error = 0.010, p = 0.004) and STAI-S and STAI-T scores when age was controlled (both p = 0.003). The severity of anxiety experienced during the recent COVID-19 pandemic among healthcare professionals, who provide medical care directly to COVID-19-positive patients, is found to be related to low AMH levels.","Yegin, Gülin Feykan; Desdicioglu, Raziye; Seçen, Elcin Islek; Aydin, Serap; Bal, Ceylan; Göka, Erol; Keskin, Huseyin Levent",Reprod. sci,,254

314897,Sex and Gender Differences in Health,2021,"BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic general medical complications have received the most attention, whereas only few studies address the potential direct effect on mental health of SARS-CoV-2 and the neurotropic potential. Furthermore, the indirect effects of the pandemic on general mental health are of increasing concern, particularly since the SARS-CoV-1 epidemic (2002-2003) was associated with psychiatric complications. METHODS: We systematically searched the database Pubmed including studies measuring psychiatric symptoms or morbidities associated with COVID-19 among infected patients and among none infected groups the latter divided in psychiatric patients, health care workers and non-health care workers. RESULTS: A total of 43 studies were included. Out of these, only two studies evaluated patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection, whereas 41 evaluated the indirect effect of the pandemic (2 on patients with preexisting psychiatric disorders, 20 on medical health care workers, and 19 on the general public). 18 of the studies were case-control studies/compared to norm, while 25 of the studies had no control groups. The two studies investigating COVID-19 patients found a high level of post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) (96.2%) and significantly higher level of depressive symptoms (p = 0.016). Patients with preexisting psychiatric disorders reported worsening of psychiatric symptoms. Studies investigating health care workers found increased depression/depressive symptoms, anxiety, psychological distress and poor sleep quality. Studies of the general public revealed lower psychological well-being and higher scores of anxiety and depression compared to before COVID-19, while no difference when comparing these symptoms in the initial phase of the outbreak to four weeks later. A variety of factors were associated with higher risk of psychiatric symptoms and/or low psychological well-being including female gender, poor-self-related health and relatives with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Research evaluating the direct neuropsychiatric consequences and the indirect effects on mental health is highly needed to improve treatment, mental health care planning and for preventive measures during potential subsequent pandemics.","Vindegaard, Nina; Benros, Michael Eriksen",Brain Behav Immun,,254

Examining these questions through the lens of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the book looks at environmental, social and economic treaty regimes. It analyses legal methodologies as well as comparative methods of assessing the relationship between the SDGs and treaty regimes and international law. Contradictions exist between international treaty regimes and principles of international law resulting in conflicting implementation of the treaty regimes and of global governance mechanisms. Without determining these areas of contest and highlighting their detrimental impacts, the SDGs and other efforts at global governance cannot maximize their legal and societal benefits. The book concludes by suggesting a path forward for the SDGs and for international treaty regimes that is forged in a solid understanding and application of the advantages of global governance mechanisms, including reflections from the COVID-19 pandemic experience. Addressing the strengths, gaps and weaknesses related to treaty regimes and global governance mechanisms, the book provides readers with a comprehensive understanding of this increasingly important topic.

We aimed to investigate the relationship of psychological and health markers with energy balance-related behaviors during the pandemic-related extended home confinement. Ratings for stress, boredom, cravings, sleep, self-control, and beliefs about weight control were collected from 1,609 adults using a questionnaire between April 24th-May 4th, 2020, while COVID-19 associated shelter-in-place guidelines were instituted across the US. We calculated four energy balance behavior scores (physical activity risk index, unhealthy eating risk index, healthy eating risk index, sedentary behavior index), and conducted a latent profile analysis of the risk factors. We examined psychological and health correlates of these risk patterns. Boredom, cravings for sweet/savory foods, and high sleepiness ratings related to high risk of increasing unhealthy eating and sedentary behavior and decreasing physical activity and healthy eating. Having greater self-control, control over cravings, or positive mood was related to lowering all aspects of energy intake and energy expenditure risks. Although individuals in risk pattern classes showed similarity in physical activity and healthy/unhealthy eating habits, they exhibited different patterns of positive mood, craving control, food cravings, boredom, and self-control. Psychological and health variables may have a significant role to play in risk behaviors associated with weight gain during the COVID-19 related home confinement. Emerging behavioral patterns may be meaningful in developing targeted weight management interventions during the current pandemic.","Bhutani, S.; vanDellen, M. R.; Haskins, L. B.; Cooper, J.

A systematic review,2020,"The current coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) has led mental health systems to uncertainty regarding safe continuation of clozapine monitoring protocols. Clozapine is without doubt the only antipsychotic available with repeatedly proven efficacy in treatment resistant schizophrenia.1 Replacing clozapine with an alternative antipsychotic in patients stabilized with clozapine can potentially lead to higher risk of relapse or exacerbation of severity of illness.1 Clozapine, as already known, has a number of side effects, some of which can be serious, thus patients receiving clozapine require ongoing scheduled monitoring. Side effects of clozapine include neutropenia or agranulocytosis, myocarditis, fever, hypersalivation, weight gain and constipation. These side effects can be detected and treated when recognized on time decreasing the possibility of serious consequences making the implementation of an ongoing treatment monitoring protocol for patients on clozapine mandatory.2 Since it was advised for all mental health providers in most countries worldwide to limit non-urgent hospital visits and procedures to reduce the risk of contamination a challenge arose for patients' ability to access health care facilities for their routine clozapine monitoring. Nevertheless, the majority of Mental Health Care Authorities decided to ensure access for all patients on clozapine to their routine monitoring protocol.3,4 To date, no data exist on any potential relationship between antipsychotic use and the risk of contamination with SARS-CoV-2 or the development of severe symptoms of the infection. The literature suggests that patients receiving antipsychotics, especially clozapine, have an increased risk of developing pneumonia, leading to the assumption that patients receiving clozapine are at higher risk to develop COVID-19. 1 Balancing the importance of monitoring continuation against the increased risk for COVID-19, an International Consensus Statement was recently published addressing a monitoring protocol with reduced visits. The Consensus suggested reduced hematologic monitoring frequency of every 3 months with a prescription of 90 days clozapine supply (if safe). The above applies to patients receiving clozapine for at least one year without neutropenia. &#932;he risk of neutropenia after 12 months of clozapine treatment falls significantly.4 Based on the above it is suggested to all clozapine clinics to implement a guidance monitoring protocol for all patients on clozapine to ensure safety during the pandemic. Besides hematological monitoring that requires physical contact with healthcare workers it is significant to implement a telemedicine appointment in frequent intervals to monitor symptoms of infection, symptoms of cardiovascular diseases and constipation. Patient should also be advised to regularly monitor one's blood pressure and pulses and ideally be educated on how by a member of the staff. If a patient is detected with any symptoms related to the above an emergency appointment for evaluation should be planned. Overall, since both the consequences and the duration of the pandemic are unknown, mental health services must work jointly to implement a clozapine monitoring plan to ensure safe continuation in such a vulnerable population.","Nystazaki, Maria; Alevizopoulos, Giorgos",Psychiatriki,,254
322736,Regional vulnerability for COVID-19 in Cameroon,2020,"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID­19) pandemic has forced the scientific community to rapidly develop highly reliable diagnostic methods in order to effectively and accurately diagnose this pathology, thus limiting the spread of infection. Although the structural and molecular characteristics of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS­CoV­2) were initially unknown, various diagnostic strategies useful for making a correct diagnosis of COVID­19 have been rapidly developed by private research laboratories and biomedical companies. At present, rapid antigen or antibody tests, immunoenzymatic serological tests and molecular tests based on RT­PCR are the most widely used and validated techniques worldwide. Apart from these conventional methods, other techniques, including isothermal nucleic acid amplification techniques, clusters of regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/Cas (CRISPR/Cas)­based approaches or digital PCR methods are currently used in research contexts or are awaiting approval for diagnostic use by competent authorities. In order to provide guidance for the correct use of COVID­19 diagnostic tests, the present review describes the diagnostic strategies available which may be used for the diagnosis of COVID­19 infection in both clinical and research settings. In particular, the technical and instrumental characteristics of the diagnostic methods used are described herein. In addition, updated and detailed information about the type of sample, the modality and the timing of use of specific tests are also discussed.","Falzone, Luca; Gattuso, Giuseppe; Tsatsakis, Aristidis; Spandidos, Demetrios A; Libra, Massimo",Int. j. mol. med,,254

324804,COVID-19: bringing out the best in anesthesiologists and looking toward the future,2020,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease caused by mutations in the CFTR gene. Although viral respiratory tract infections are, in general, more severe in patients with CF compared with the general population, a small number of studies indicate that SARS-CoV-2 does not cause a worse infection in CF. This is surprising since comorbidities including preexisting lung disease have been reported to be associated with worse outcomes in SARS-CoV-2 infections. Several recent studies provide insight into why SARS-CoV-2 may not produce more severe outcomes in CF. First, ACE and ACE2, genes that play key roles in SARS-CoV-2 infection, have some variants that are predicted to reduce the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Second, mRNA for ACE2 is elevated and mRNA for TMPRSS2, a serine protease, is decreased in CF airway epithelial cells. Increased ACE2 is predicted to enhance SARS-CoV-2 binding to cells but would increase conversion of angiotensin II, which is proinflammatory, to angiotensin-1-7, which is anti-inflammatory. Thus, increased ACE2 would reduce inflammation and lung damage due to SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, decreased TMPRSS2 would reduce SARS-CoV-2 entry into airway epithelial cells. Second, many CF patients are treated with azithromycin, which suppresses viral infection and lung inflammation and inhibits the activity of furin, a serine protease. Finally, the CF lung contains high levels of serine protease inhibitors including ecotin and SERPINB1, which are predicted to reduce the ability of TMPRSS2 to facilitate SARS-CoV-2 entry into airway epithelial cells. Thus, a variety of factors may mitigate the severity of SARS-CoV-2 in CF.","Stanton, Bruce A; Hampton, Thomas H; Ashare, Alix",Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol,,254

Although general and local public health report deathly cases, case fatality rates are still largely unknown. Thus, we sought to evaluate the mortality of COVID-19. METHODS: We searched PubMed and EMBASE databases for articles evaluating the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients that included clinical outcomes, between December 2020 and 24 April 2020. Two authors performed an independent selection using predefined terms of search. RESULTS: We retrieved 33 studies with a total of 13,398 patients with COVID-19 diagnosis. The mortality rate of the COVID-19 patients was 17.1% (95% CI 12.7; 22.7, I2 = 96.9%). For general patients admitted to the hospital (excluding critical care-only studies) the mortality rate of the COVID-19 was 11.5% (95% CI 7.7; 16.9, I2 = 96.7%). Among critical illness studies (n = 7) we found a 40.5% mortality (95% CI 31.2; 50.6, I2 = 91.8%). CONCLUSION: High COVID-19 mortality among general admitted patients and critical care cases should guide resources allocations and economic burden calculations during the pandemics.","Macedo, Ana; Gonçalves, Nilza; Febra, Cláudia",Ann Epidemiol,,254

326599,COVID-19 and emergency care for adults experiencing homelessness,2020,"BACKGROUND: ActiGraph accelerometry is widely used in nursing research to estimate daily physical activity. Heart rate variability (HRV), a measure of autonomic modulation, can be assessed in conjunction with the ActiGraph using a Polar H7 Bluetooth heart rate monitor. There is a paucity of nursing literature to guide nurse researchers' protocol development when using the ActiGraph to assess both physical activity and short-term HRV via its Bluetooth capabilities. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to describe a standardized research ActiGraph and HRV (ActiGraph HRV) protocol for an ongoing randomized controlled trial to measure physical activity and short-term HRV in patients with ischemic heart disease who report hopelessness. METHODS: We outline the study protocol for the standardization of reliable and rigorous physical activity and HRV data collection using the ActiGraph wGT3X-BT and Polar H7 Bluetooth heart rate monitor, and data analysis using ActiLife and Kubios software programs. RESULTS: Sixty-four participants enrolled in the randomized controlled trial to date, and 45 (70.3%) have completed or are actively participating in the study. Heart rate variability data have been collected on 43 of the 45 participants (96%) to date. During the first data collection time point, 42 of 44 participants (95.5%) wore the ActiGraph for a minimum of 5 valid days, followed by 28 of 31 participants (90.3%) and 25 of 26 participants (96.2%) at subsequent data collection time points. The intraclass correlation for physical activity in this study is 0.95 and 0.98 for HRV. DISCUSSION: Revisions to the protocol were successfully implemented at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic for data collection using social distancing. The protocol was additionally amended in response to an unanticipated problem with ActiGraph battery life using Bluetooth technology. Use of the ActiGraph HRV protocol has led to a reliable and rigorous measurement of physical activity and HRV for patients with ischemic heart disease who report hopelessness in this randomized controlled trial. CONCLUSION: We provide an ActiGraph HRV protocol that can be adapted as a model in the development of ActiGraph HRV protocols for future nursing research in community and home-based settings while maximizing social distancing in the current and future pandemics.","Luong, Anna; Goodyke, Madison; Dunn, Susan L; Baynard, Tracy; Bronas, Ulf",J. cardiovasc. nurs,,254

330713,Comment on: Coronavirus Disease 2019 in Geriatrics and Long-Term Care: The ABCDs of COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: Recently, several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have evaluated the effect of N95 respirators compared with medical masks to protect against acute respiratory infections. However, these studies are limited by modest sample sizes and inconclusive results. Therefore, the goal of the present study was to review the relevant and available published RCTs with the aid of the increased power of meta-analytic methods in order to assess the effectiveness of medical masks and N95 respirators in reducing the risk of respiratory infections. METHODS: This meta-analysis follows the recommendations of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement for conducting and reporting results. We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane databases from inception through April 1, 2020 to identify potentially relevant studies. Two authors (LS and JS) independently searched the titles and abstracts of the potentially eligible articles. They independently retrieved required data from the eligible trials; the data were initially tabulated for statistical analysis. Two authors (JRL and LS) independently assessed the methodological quality of the included RCTs using the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias. RESULTS: Six articles met the inclusion criteria. The pooled analysis showed that N95 respirators did not reduce the risk of infection with respiratory viruses compared with medical/surgical masks (5.7% vs. 7.9%; RR = 1.12; 95% CI: 0.88-1.41; p = 0.36); however, there was no statistically significant difference in laboratory-confirmed influenza between N95 and medical masks (RR = 0.91; 95% CI: 0.77-1.07; p = 0.26). Medical masks provided similar protection against other viruses, including coronavirus (RR = 0.74; 95% CI: 0.32-1.73; p = 0.49). Respiratory illness, as well as influenza-like illness were less frequently observed with N95 respirators. CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis suggests that there are insufficient data to definitively determine whether N95 respirators are superior to medical masks in protection against transmissible acute respiratory infections. Further randomized trials are necessary to compare the above methods of respiratory protection in the context of COVID-19 incidence.","Barycka, Katarzyna; Szarpak, Lukasz; Filipiak, Krzysztof Jerzy; Jaguszewski, Milosz; Smereka, Jacek; Ladny, Jerzy Robert; Turan, Oguz",PLoS One,,254

AIM: To explore the severity of perceived stress and potential correlates among the HCPs seeking online mental health services during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: A descriptive study was conducted among 34 HCPs to assess levels of psychological distress using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) questionnaire. The HCPs working in different departments were compared using &#967;2-test for categorized variables and t-test for continuous ones, followed by the analysis of covariate (ANCOVA) to compare the perceived stress. Linear regression for the PSS-10 score was performed to identify potential correlates of stress. RESULTS: The sample overall (n = 34) showed a relatively moderate level of perceived stress (PSS mean = 15.71 ± 4.02) with 38% identified as depressed (PHQ-9 &#8805; 5) and 24% as suffering from anxiety (GAD-7 &#8805; 5). Those working at intensive care units (ICUs) or in departments of respiratory medicine (RM) demonstrated significantly higher perceived stress than those at other departments (adjusted mean: 17.48 ± 0.96 vs. 13.06 ± 1.25, p = .018, partial Î·2 = 0.173). High perceived stress was most strongly associated with being depressed (beta = 0.486, p = .002) and working at ICUs/RM (beta = 0.345, p = .023).

We forecast the possible COVID-19 outbreak in one US state (Utah) by applying empirical data from South Korea and Italy, two countries that implemented disparate public health actions. Forecasts were created by aligning the start of the pandemic in Utah with that in South Korea and Italy, getting a short-run forecast based on actual daily rates of spread, and long-run forecast by employing a log-logistic model with four parameters. Applying the South Korea model, the epidemic peak in Utah is 169 cases/day, with epidemic resolution by the end of May. Applying the Italy model, new cases are forecast to exceed 200/day by mid-April, with the potential for 250 new cases a day at the epidemic peak, with the epidemic continuing through the end of August. We identify a 3-month variation in the likely length of the pandemic, a 1.5-fold difference in the number of daily infections at outbreak peak, and a 3-fold difference in the expected cumulative cases when applying the experience of two developed countries in handling this virus to the Utah context.","Qeadan, Fares; Honda, Trenton; Gren, Lisa H; Dailey-Provost, Jennifer; Benson, L Scott; VanDerslice, James A; Porucznik, Christina A; Waters, A Blake; Lacey, Steven; Shoaf, Kimberley",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,254
335035,The Effect of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Economics of U.S. Emergency Care,2021,"Among the many approaches to Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) prevention, the possible role of nutrition has so far been rather underestimated. Foods are very rich in substances, with a potential beneficial effect on health, and some of these could have an antiviral action or be important in modulating the immune system and in defending cells from the oxidative stress associated with infection. This short review draws the attention on some components of citrus fruits, and especially of the orange (Citrus sinensis), well known for its vitamin and flavonoid content. Among the flavonoids, hesperidin has recently attracted the attention of researchers, because it binds to the key proteins of the Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Several computational methods, independently applied by different researchers, showed that hesperidin has a low binding energy, both with the coronavirus ""spike"" protein, and with the main protease that transforms the early proteins of the virus (pp1a and ppa1b) into the complex responsible for viral replication. The binding energy of hesperidin to these important components is lower than that of lopinavir, ritonavir, and indinavir, suggesting that it could perform an effective antiviral action. Furthermore, both hesperidin and ascorbic acid counteract the cell damaging effects of the oxygen free radicals triggered by virus infection and inflammation. There is discussion about the preventive efficacy of vitamin C, at the dose achievable by the diet, but recent reviews suggest that this substance can be useful in the case of strong immune system burden caused by viral disease. Computational methods and laboratory studies support the need to undertake apposite preclinical, epidemiological, and experimental studies on the potential benefits of citrus fruit components for the prevention of infectious diseases, including COVID-19.","Bellavite, Paolo; Donzelli, Alberto",,,254

We compared the diagnostic performance of three specimen types for characterizing SARS-CoV-2 in infected nursing home residents. METHODS: A convenience sample of 17 residents were enrolled within 15 days of first positive SARS-CoV-2 result by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and prospectively followed for 42 days. Anterior nasal swabs (AN), oropharyngeal swabs (OP), and saliva specimens (SA) were collected on the day of enrollment, every 3 days for the first 21 days, then weekly for 21 days. Specimens were tested for presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA using RT-PCR and replication-competent virus by viral culture. RESULTS: Comparing the three specimen types collected from each participant at each time point, the concordance of paired RT-PCR results ranged from 80-88%. After the first positive result, SA and OP were RT-PCR-positive for &#8804;48 days; AN were RT-PCR-positive for &#8804;33 days.

336996,Covid-19 and Diabetes in Hawaii,2020,"In this study, we comprehensively analyzed multispecific antibody kinetics of different immunoglobulins in hospitalized patients with acute severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Three hundred fifty-four blood samples longitudinally obtained from 81 IgG-seroconverting progressed coronavirus disease 2019 (CoVID-19) patients were quantified for spike 1 (S1), S2, and nucleocapsid protein (NCP)-specific IgM, IgA, IgG, and total Ig antibodies using a microarray, 11 different enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs)/chemiluminescence immunoassays (CLIAs), and 1 rapid test by seven manufacturers. The assays' specificity was assessed in 130 non-CoVID-19 pneumonia patients. Using the microarray, NCP-specific IgA and IgG antibodies continuously displayed higher detection rates during acute CoVID-19 than S1- and S2-specific ones. S1-specific IgG antibodies, however, reached higher peak values. Until the 26th day post-symptom onset, all patients developed IgG responses against S1, S2, and NCP. Although detection rates by ELISAs/CLIAs generally resembled those of the microarray, corresponding to the target antigen, sensitivities and specificities varied among all tests. Notably, patients with more severe CoVID-19 displayed higher IgG and IgA levels, but this difference was mainly observed with S1-specific immunoassays. In patients with high SARS-CoV-2 levels in the lower respiratory tract, we observed high detection rates of IgG and total Ig immunoassays with a particular rise of S1-specific IgG antibodies when viral concentrations in the tracheal aspirate subsequently declined over time. In summary, our study demonstrates that differences in sensitivity among commercial immunoassays during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection are only partly related to the target antigen. Importantly, our data indicate that NCP-specific IgA and IgG antibodies are detected earlier, while higher S1-specific IgA antibody levels occur in severely ill patients.","Semmler, Georg; Traugott, Marianna Theresia; Graninger, Marianne; Hoepler, Wolfgang; Seitz, Tamara; Kelani, Hasan; Karolyi, Mario; Pawelka, Erich; Aragón de La Cruz, Sara; Puchhammer-Stöckl, Elisabeth; Aberle, Stephan Walter; Stiasny, Karin; Zoufaly, Alexander; Aberle, Judith Helene; Weseslindtner, Lukas",J. clin. microbiol,,254

However, low adoption rates have become a major issue that prevents these apps from achieving their full potential. In this paper, we present a national-scale survey experiment ($N = 1963$) in the U.S. to investigate the effects of app design choices and individual differences on COVID-19 contact-tracing app adoption intentions. We found that individual differences such as prosocialness, COVID-19 risk perceptions, general privacy concerns, technology readiness, and demographic factors played a more important role than app design choices such as decentralized design vs. centralized design, location use, app providers, and the presentation of security risks. Certain app designs could exacerbate the different preferences in different sub-populations which may lead to an inequality of acceptance to certain app design choices (e.g., developed by state health authorities vs. a large tech company) among different groups of people (e.g., people living in rural areas vs. people living in urban areas).

341043,Feasibility of Inpatient Continuous Glucose Monitoring During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Early Experience,2020,"Piezoelectric properties and adequate porosity play important roles in bone tissue engineering. In this paper we describe the fabrication of piezoelectric polypropylene (PP) foam using injection molding to be utilized as a potential cost-effective scaffold for bone tissue engineering. One-side mechanical skin removal from the foam was used to investigate the effect of the solid skin on the piezoelectric performance. The microcellular structure, relative density, crystalline structure, mechanical properties, piezoelectric properties under repeated impact pressure and biocompatibility of the scaffolds were investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), water displacement method, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), uniaxial tension tests, piezoelectric tests and MTT assays, respectively. Uniform spherical cells, with an average size of 75 µm and a density of 1.23 × 106cells/cm−3, suitable for bone regeneration, were imaged by SEM. The DSC results showed β crystals formation in the PP foam during the foaming process which would be valuable for mechanical properties. The foaming process did not reduce the mechanical properties significantly. The foaming process promoted the piezoelectric responses by 134, 922, and 87%, respectively, for the PP samples with 3, 2 and 1 mm thickness. The biocompatibility test suggested improved cellular biocompatibility by foaming. Overall, the results demonstrated the development of a cost-effective scaffold for tissue engineering.","Samadi, Ali; Hasanzadeh, Rezgar; Azdast, Taher; Abdollahi, Hossein; Zarrintaj, Payam; Saeb, Mohammad Reza",J Macromol Sci Part B Phys,,254

It has published also ""best practices"" in which it advises to avoid touching the mask while wearing it. This might be challenging. The purpose of this study was to investigate the frequency of mask-touching behavior in public transportation. Methods: Observational study using data collected in real life. This survey was conducted in subways and local trains of the greater Paris region, France, between May 4th and 25th, 2020. Public Transportation users were covertly observed. Demographic characteristics, type of mask and the main activity were collected by the investigator. The duration of observation, the frequency of touching face mask, hair and the uncovered area of the face were also recorded. Frequency of mask-touching per hour was determined. Results: One hundred eighty two persons were observed. The median of estimated age [1st and 3rd interquartile] was 35 [30;45] years and 87 (48%) were women. One hundred forty three (79%) were wearing surgical mask. The median time of observation was 8 [4;12] minutes. During this period, 87 (48%) persons touched their mask 15 [7.5;30] times per hour of whom only two (8%) have used hydroalcoholic solution to disinfect their hands. Conclusions: Mask touching is frequent and is rarely followed by hand disinfection. Actions regarding mask use should be taken to improve compliance.","Guellich, Aziz; Tella, Emilie; Ariane, Molka; Grodner, Camille; Nguyen-Chi, Hoai-Nam; Mahé, Emmanuel",J Transp Health,,254

Over a short span of time, the structures of therapeutic target proteins for SARS-CoV-2 were identified based on the homology modelled structure of similar virus, SARS-CoV that transmitted rapidly in 2003. Since the outset of the disease, the research community has been looking for a potential drug lead. Out of all the known resolved structures related to SARS-CoV-2; 3-chymotrypsin (3 C) like protease (3CLpro) is considered as an attractive anti-viral drug compound on the grounds of its role in viral replication and probable non-interactive competency to bind to any viral host protein. To the best of our knowledge, till date only one compound has been identified and tested in-vitro as a potent inhibitor of 3CLpro protein, addressed as N3 (PubChem Compound CID: 6323191) and is known to bind irreversibly to 3CLpro suppressing its activity. Using computational approach, we intend to identify a probable natural fungal metabolite to interact and inhibit 3CLpro. Here after performing docking and molecular dynamics of various small molecules derived as a secondary metabolite from fungi, we propose Flaviolin as potent inhibitor of 3CLpro of novel Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.

346145,Clinician Perspectives on Caring for Dying Patients During the Pandemic: A Mixed-Methods Study,2021,"BACKGROUND: The new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 led to the COVID-19 pandemic starting in January 2020. The Swiss Federal Council prescribed a lockdown of nonessential businesses. Students and employees of higher education institutions had to install home offices and participate in online lectures. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this survey study was to evaluate lifestyle habits, such as physical activity (PA), sitting time, nutritional habits (expressed as median modified Mediterranean Diet Score [mMDS]), alcohol consumption habits, and sleeping behavior during a 2-month period of confinement and social distancing due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Survey participants were students and employees of a Swiss university of applied sciences. METHODS: All students and employees from Bern University of Applied Sciences, Department of Health Professions (ie, nursing, nutrition and dietetics, midwifery, and physiotherapy divisions) were invited to complete an anonymous online survey during the COVID-19 confinement period. Information on the lifestyle dimensions of PA, sitting time, nutritional and alcohol consumption habits, and sleep behavior was gathered using adaptations of validated questionnaires. Frequency analyses and nonparametric statistical methods were used for data analysis. Significance was set at 5% &#945; level of error. RESULTS: Prevalence of non-health-enhancing PA was 37.1%, with participants of the division of physiotherapy showing the lowest prevalence. Prevalence of long sitting time (>8 hours/day) was 36.1%. The median mMDS was 9, where the maximal score was 15, with participants of the division of nutrition and dietetics being more adherent to a Mediterranean diet as compared to the other groups. Prevalence of nonadherence to the Swiss alcohol consumption recommendations was 8.3%. Prevalence of low sleeping quality was 44.7%, while the median sleeping duration was 8 hours, which is considered healthy for adult populations. CONCLUSIONS: In the group analysis, differences in PA, sitting time, and mMDS were observed between different divisions of health professions as well as between Bachelor of Science students, Master of Science students, and employees. Therefore, public health messages regarding healthy lifestyle habits during home confinement should be more group specific. The results of this study may provide support for the implementation of group-specific health promotion interventions at universities in pandemic conditions.

RECENT FINDINGS: Although the currently available anti-HTN agents have broad applicability in treating HTN, additional agents, such as angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors and novel nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid antagonists, have recently gained clinical significance. In addition, there have been some anecdotal concerns regarding the adverse effects, indications, and risks of COVID-19 infection/mortality when using certain anti-HTN agents. SUMMARY: Current guidelines currently address the treatment of primary HTN. However, isolated HTN is uncommon and often involves comorbid diseases that require specific regimentation. Several experimental medications are currently in late-stage trials showing potential superiority over current drugs that are available in the market.","Mendoza, M. F.; Kachur, S. M.; Lavie, C.

We established a program of rapid vaccination and evaluation of antibody-mediated response to all EUA COVID-19 vaccines in an inner city minority population to determine the factors that contribute to the poor seroconversion to COVID-19 vaccination in this population. We conducted a cross-sectional cohort study of 126 patients with hematologic malignancies in the outpatient practices of our institution who completed their vaccination series with one of the three FDA EUA COVID-19 vaccines, Moderna, Pfizer, or Johnson & Johnson (J&J). We qualitatively measured Spike IgG production in all patients using the AdviseDx SARS-CoV-2 IgG II assay and quantitatively in 106 patients who completed their vaccination series with at least 14 days after the 2nd dose of the Moderna or Pfizer vaccines or 28d after the single J&J vaccine. Patient characteristics were analyzed using standard descriptive statistics and associations between patient characteristics, cancer subtypes, treatments, and vaccine response were assessed using Fisher Exact test or Kruskal-Wallis Rank Sum test. The majority of patients (74%) were minorities. Seventy patients (60%) received Pfizer, 36 patients (31%) Moderna, and 10 patients (9%) J&J. We observed a high-rate of seropositivity (86%) with 16 pts (14%) having a negative Spike IgG. Of the 86 minority patients included, 94% Blacks (30/32) and 87% (39/45) Hispanics showed seropositivity. The factors that contributed to significantly lower seroconversion rates included patients with Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (p=0.005), those who received cytotoxic chemotherapy (p=0.002), IVIG (p=0.01), CAR-T cell therapy (p=0.00002), and CD20 monoclonal antibodies (Ab) (p=0.0000008). Plasma cell neoplasms (p=0.02), immunomodulatory agents (p=0.01), and proteasome inhibitors (p=0.01) had significantly higher seroconversion rates, and those with a history of prior COVID-19 (11%, 12/106) had significantly higher antibody titers (p=0.0003). The positivity rate was 86% (37 seropositive, 6 seronegative) for autologous HSCT and 75% (3 seropositive, 1 seronegative) for allogeneic HSCT. No life-threatening AE were observed. We show high seroconversion rates after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in non-White patients with hematologic malignancies treated with a wide spectrum of therapeutic modalities. Vaccination is safe, effective, and should be encouraged in most patients with hematologic malignancies. Our minorities based study could be employed as an educational tool to dispel myths and provide data driven evidence to overcome vaccine hesitancy.","Shapiro, Lauren C; Thakkar, Astha; Gali, Radhika; Gonzalez-Lugo, Jesus D; Bazarbachi, Abdul-Hamid; Rahman, Shafia; Pradhan, Kith; Fehn, Karen; Abreu, Michelly; Kornblum, Noah; Gritsman, Kira; Goldfinger, Mendel; Shastri, Aditi; Mantzaris, Ioannis; Braunschweig, Ira; Halmos, Balazs; Verma, Amit; McCort, Margaret; Bachier-Rodriguez, Lizamarie; Sica, R Alejandro",,,254

We compared the performance of the Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 and LIAISON® SARS-CoV-2â¯S1/S2 IgG tests. The seroconversion panel comprised of 120 samples from 13 hospitalized COVID-19 patients. For the sensitivity and specificity testing, samples from COVID-19 outpatients >15â¯days after positive nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) result (nâ¯=â¯35) and serum control samples collected before the COVID-19 era (nâ¯=â¯161) were included in the material. Samples for the detection of possible cross-reactions were also tested. Based on our results, the SARS-CoV-2 antibodies can be quite reliably detected 2â¯weeks after NAAT positivity and 3â¯weeks after the symptom onset with both tests. However, since some COVID-19 patients were positive only with Elecsys®, the antibodies should be screened against N-antigen (Elecsys®) and reactive samples confirmed with S antigen (LIAISON®), but both results should be reported.

Nevertheless, detailed mechanisms of hyperuricosuria-induced kidney stone formation remained unclear. This study examined changes in cellular proteome and function of renal tubular cells after treatment with high-dose UA for 48-h. Quantitative proteomics using 2-DE followed by nanoLC-ESI-ETD MS/MS tandem mass spectrometry revealed significant changes in levels of 22 proteins in the UA-treated cells. These proteomic data could be confirmed by Western blotting. Functional assays revealed an increase in intracellular ATP level and enhancement of tissue repairing capability in the UA-treated cells. Interestingly, levels of HSP70 and HSP90 (the known receptors for CaOx crystals) were increased in apical membranes of the UA-treated cells. CaOx crystal-cell adhesion assay revealed significant increase in CaOx-binding capability of the UA-treated cells, whereas neutralization of the surface HSP70 and/or HSP90 using their specific monoclonal antibodies caused significant reduction in such binding capability. These findings highlighted changes in renal tubular cells in response to high-dose UA that may, at least in part, explain the pathogenic mechanisms of hyperuricosuria-induced mixed kidney stone disease.","Sutthimethakorn, Suchitra; Thongboonkerd, Visith",Chem Biol Interact,,254

361184,Prenatal care redesign: creating flexible maternity care models through virtual care,2020,"People with HIV (PWH) might have a higher risk of adverse coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outcomes. Several scores were developed to predict COVID-19 progression to critical disease and are often used among PWH. We assessed the performance of two commonly used risk equations among PWH and COVID-19. Participants were identified from a multicenter cohort of 6,361 PWH on regular follow-up at 2 university hospitals. Of 99 HIV-infected individuals with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, 63 had complete data and were included in this analysis. CALL and COVID-GRAM scores were calculated and participants were stratified into low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups for each. Discrimination was assessed using receiver operating characteristic curves. Calibration was evaluated using observed versus expected (O:E) ratios and the Hosmer-Lemeshow &#967;2 goodness-of-fit statistic. Scores were adjusted by increasing one category level in individuals with nadir CD4 lymphocyte count <200/µL. Participants had a median nadir and current CD4 counts of 207 [interquartile range (IQR) 119-345] and 440 (IQR 280-719) cells/µL. Ten (15.9%) individuals progressed to critical disease and 4 (6.3%) died. Assessed scores showed acceptable discrimination (area under the curve 0.701-0.771) and were overall calibrated (O:E ratio 1.01). However, both overestimated the risk of progression among individuals in the low- and high-risk categories, whereas they underestimated the risk in the intermediate category (O:E 1.20-1.21). Thus, 50% of critically ill individuals were not identified as high risk. Assigning PWH with low nadir CD4 counts a higher risk of progression reduced the proportion of individuals not identified to 20%.

364286,"Criticality of physical/social distancing, handwashing, respiratory hygiene and face-masking during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond",2020,"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has triggered serious disruption in economic, social and cultural dynamics around the globe. Higher education has also suffered undeniable challenges as a result of the pandemic, with thousands of university students all over the world experiencing displacement, disconnect and disengagement from formal learning. In the Global South, online and distance education programmes tend to be concentrated in urban centres. In Nepal, students from rural areas, low socio-economic and gendered spaces, and those with low proficiencies in English and technological skills are experiencing inequalities in access to and participation in online and distance education. This article outlines how universities' shift to online teaching and learning modes due to the COVID-19 pandemic has reinforced social inequalities in Nepal. For the study presented here, the author collected data through netnographic research methods. These included online interviews with university executives, online focus group discussions (FGDs) with university teachers and students, observation of and participation in online classes and policy conferences and reviews of online documents. The article analyses three overriding mechanisms which are reinforcing social inequalities in higher education: (1) universities' policy trajectories in shifting teaching/learning from face-to-face to online mode; (2) infrastructural limitations challenging effective implementation of online teaching/learning; and (3) a lack of strong pedagogic support for students from disadvantaged and marginalised spaces, including those with low proficiencies in English and technological skills. The author presents a number of tangible strategies for universities to implement in order to mitigate social inequalities. He recommends the adoption of policies and practices that optimise the inclusive use of online and distance education programmes for best effect, both now and in the post-pandemic era.","Devkota, Kamal Raj",Int Rev Educ,,254
364490,The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown on routine hospital care for other illnesses,2020,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has significantly altered health care delivery, requiring clinicians and hospitals to adapt to rapidly changing hospital policies and social distancing guidelines. At our large academic medical center, clinicians reported that existing information on distribution channels, including emails and hospital intranet posts, was inadequate to keep everyone abreast with these changes. To address these challenges, we adapted a mobile app developed in-house to communicate critical changes in hospital policies and enable direct telephonic communication between clinical team members and hospitalized patients, to support social distancing guidelines and remote rounding. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to describe the unique benefits and challenges of adapting an app developed in-house to facilitate communication and remote rounding during COVID-19. METHODS: We adapted moblMD, a mobile app available on the iOS and Android platforms. In conjunction with our Hospital Incident Command System, resident advisory council, and health system innovation center, we identified critical, time-sensitive policies for app usage. A shared collaborative document was used to align app-based communication with more traditional communication channels. To minimize synchronization efforts, we particularly focused on high-yield policies, and the time of last review and the corresponding reviewer were noted for each protocol. To facilitate social distancing and remote patient rounding, the app was also populated with a searchable directory of numbers to patient bedside phones and hospital locations. We monitored anonymized user activity from February 1 to July 31, 2020. RESULTS: On its first release, 1104 clinicians downloaded moblMD during the observation period, of which 46% (n=508) of downloads occurred within 72 hours of initial release. COVID-19 policies in the app were reviewed most commonly during the first week (801 views). Users made sustained use of hospital phone dialing features, including weekly peaks of 2242 phone number dials, 1874 directory searches, and 277 patient room phone number searches through the last 2 weeks of the observation period. Furthermore, clinicians submitted 56 content- and phone number-related suggestions through moblMD. CONCLUSIONS: We rapidly developed and deployed a communication-focused mobile app early during COVID-19, which has demonstrated initial and sustained value among clinicians in communicating with in-patients and each other during social distancing. Our internal innovation benefited from our team's familiarity with institutional structures, short feedback loops, limited security and privacy implications, and a path toward sustainability provided by our innovation center. Challenges in content management were overcome through synchronization efforts and timestamping review. As COVID-19 continues to alter health care delivery, user activity metrics suggest that our solution will remain important in our efforts to continue providing safe and up-to-date clinical care.","Anyanwu, Emeka C; Ward, R Parker; Shah, Atman; Arora, Vineet; Umscheid, Craig A",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,,254

Protein aggregation in brain can be considered as one of the important reasons behind the neurodegeneration. SARS-CoV-2 Spike S1 protein receptor binding domain (SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD) binds to heparin and heparin binding proteins. Moreover, heparin binding accelerates the aggregation of the pathological amyloid proteins present in the brain. In this paper, we have shown that the SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD binds to a number of aggregation-prone, heparin binding proteins including Aß, &#945;-synuclein, tau, prion, and TDP-43 RRM. These interactions suggests that the heparin-binding site on the S1 protein might assist the binding of amyloid proteins to the viral surface and thus could initiate aggregation of these proteins and finally leads to neurodegeneration in brain. The results will help us to prevent future outcomes of neurodegeneration by targeting this binding and aggregation process.","Idrees, Danish; Kumar, Vijay",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,,254

Acute kidney injury (AKI) was associated with higher severity and mortality of COVID-19. We aimed to evaluate the effects of comorbidities and medications in addition to determining the association between AKI, antibiotics against coinfections (AAC) and outcomes of patients. We conducted a retrospective study on adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in a tertiary center. Our primary outcomes were the incidence rate of AKI based on comorbidities and medications. The secondary outcome was to determine mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and prolonged hospitalization by AKI and AAC. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression method was used to explore predictive effects of AKI and AAC on outcomes. Out of 854 included participants, 118 patients developed AKI in whom, 57 used AAC and 61 did not. Hypertension and diabetes were the most common comorbidities in patients developed AKI. AAC, lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers, and corticosteroids had significant higher rate of administration in patients developed AKI. AAC were associated with higher deaths (odds ratio [OR] = 5.13; 95% confidence interval (CI): 3-8.78) and ICU admission (OR = 5.87; 95%CI: 2.81-12.27), while AKI had higher OR for prolonged hospitalization (3.37; 95%CI: 1.76-6.45). Both AKI and AAC are associated with poor prognosis of COVID-19.

However, no data are available on the learning curve (LC) for EUS-GE. Defining it is necessary for the creation of adequate subspecialty training programs and quality assurance. METHODS: This study is a retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained dataset of patients that underwent EUS-GE at one tertiary referral center. Primary outcome was the LC for EUS-GE defined by the number of cases needed to achieve proficiency and mastery using cumulative sum (CUSUM) analysis. Moving average graphs and sequential time-block analysis were also performed to assess procedural time. Secondary outcomes included efficacy and safety of EUS-GE. RESULTS: Eighty-seven consecutive patients underwent EUS-GE, mostly for malignant GOO. For consistency, 14 patients were excluded from analysis (noncautery-assisted EUS-GE 11, surgical anatomy 3). The same endoscopist performed all procedures using the same freehand technique. Technical success was achieved in 68 out of 73 (93%) patients. Immediate AEs occurred in 4 (5.5%) patients, whereas late AEs occurred only in 1 (1%) patient, all managed conservatively or endoscopically. All immediate adverse events occurred during the first 39 cases. Clinical success (defined as resuming at least oral liquid diet within a week) was achieved in 97% of patients. The mean procedural time was 36 minutes (SD 24). Evaluation of the CUSUM curve revealed that 25 cases were needed to achieve proficiency and 40 cases to achieve mastery. These results were confirmed with the average moving curve and sequential time-block analysis. CONCLUSION: We report, for the first time, data on the learning curve for EUS-GE. About 25 procedures can be considered as the threshold to achieve proficiency and about 40 cases are needed to reach mastery of the technique.","Jovani, Manol; Ichkhanian, Yervant; Parsa, Nasim; Singh, Sahiljeet; Brewer Gutierrez, Olaya I; Keane, Geri; Al Ghamdi, Sarah S; Ngamruengphong, Saowanee; Kumbhari, Vivek; Khashab, Mouen A",Gastrointest. endosc,,254

MATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective study reviewed the clinical and radiological evolution of 265 adult patients with COVID-19 attended at our center between March 2020 and April 2020. We recorded data related to patients' comorbidities, hospital stay, and clinical worsening (admission to the ICU, intubation, and death). We used three scoring systems taking into consideration 6 or 8 lung fields (designated 6A, 6B, and 8) to quantify lung involvement in each patient's initial abnormal chest X-ray and to classify its severity as mild, moderate, or severe, and we compared these three systems. We also recorded the presence of alveolar opacities and linear opacities (fundamentally linear atelectasis) in the first chest X-ray with pathologic findings. RESULTS: In the &#967;2 analysis, moderate or severe involvement in the three classification systems correlated with hospital admission (p=0.009 in 6A, p=0.001 in 6B, and p=0.001 in 8) and with death (p=0.02 in 6A, p=0.01 in 6B, and p=0.006 in 8). In the regression analysis, the most significant associations were 6B with alveolar involvement (OR 2.3; 95%CI 1.1.-4.7; p=0.025;) and 8 with alveolar involvement (OR 2.07; 95% CI 1.01.-4.25; p=0.046). No differences were observed in the ability of the three systems to predict clinical worsening by classifications of involvement in chest X-rays as moderate or severe. CONCLUSION: Moderate/severe extension in the three chest X-ray scoring systems evaluating the extent of involvement over 6 or 8 lung fields and the finding of alveolar opacities in the first abnormal X-ray correlated with mortality and the rate of hospitalization in the patients studied. No significant difference was found in the predictive ability of the three classification systems proposed.","Petite Felipe, D J; Rivera Campos, M I; San Miguel Espinosa, J; Malo Rubio, Y; Flores Quan, J C; Cuartero Revilla, M V",,,254

There are three main themes that emerge from the results. First, drivers of income loss were not necessarily associated with time to recovery. Second, businesses that were undercapitalized were more likely to suffer higher income loss, longer time to recovery, and less likely to be resilient. Resilient was operationalized as a scale merging perceived success, potential for growth, and perceived profitability.

We aim at ACE2 and Nsp10/Nsp16 MTase as potential drug candidate in COVID 19 management in the present work. For drug designing, various computational simulation strategies have been employed like Swiss-Model, Hawk Dock, HDOCK, py Dock, and PockDrug for homology modeling, binding energies of the molecule with a target, simulate the conformation and binding poses, statistics of protein lock with target key and drug ability, respectively. The current in-silico screening depicts that the spike protein receptor is complementary to the target when bound to each other and forms a stable complex. The MMGBSA free energy binding property of receptor and ligand is critical. The intermolecular Statistics with the target Nsp10/Nsp16 MTase complex are plausible. We have also observed a high-affinity pocket binding site with the target. Therefore, the favorable intermolecular interactions and Physico-chemical properties emanate as a drug candidate treating COVID-19. This study has approached computational tools to analyze the conformation, binding affinity, and drug ability of receptor-ligand. Thus, the spike receptor with its ACE2 receptor with Nsp10/Nsp16 MTase complex would be a potent drug against SARS CoV-2 and can cure the infection as per consensus scoring.","Siddiqa, M A; Rao, D S; Suvarna, G; Chennamachetty, V K; Verma, M K; Rao, M V R",Int J Pept Res Ther,,254

375502,What to D.O.: Ready for COVID-19 — and Every Chart in the Rack,2020,"Klebsiella pneumoniae is considered an opportunistic pathogen, constituting an ongoing health concern for immunocompromised patients, the elderly, and neonates. Reports on the isolation of K. pneumoniae from other sources are increasing, many of which express multidrug-resistant (MDR) phenotypes. Three phylogroups were identified based on nucleotide differences. Niche environments, including plants, animals, and humans appear to be colonized by different phylogroups, among which KpI (K. pneumoniae) is commonly associated with human infection. Infections with K. pneumoniae can be transmitted through contaminated food or water and can be associated with community-acquired infections or between persons and animals involved in hospital-acquired infections. Increasing reports are describing detections along the food chain, suggesting the possibility exists that this could be a hitherto unexplored reservoir for this opportunistic bacterial pathogen. Expression of MDR phenotypes elaborated by these bacteria is due to the nature of various plasmids carrying antimicrobial resistance (AMR)-encoding genes, and is a challenge to animal, environmental, and human health alike. Raman spectroscopy has the potential to provide for the rapid identification and screening of antimicrobial susceptibility of Klebsiella isolates. Moreover, hypervirulent isolates linked with extraintestinal infections express phenotypes that may support their niche adaptation. In this review, the prevalence, reservoirs, AMR, Raman spectroscopy detection, and pathogenicity of K. pneumoniae are summarized and various extraintestinal infection pathways are further narrated to extend our understanding of its adaptation and survival ability in reservoirs, and associated disease risks.","Hu, Yujie; Anes, João; Devineau, Stéphanie; Fanning, Séamus",Foodborne Pathog Dis,,254
375737,COVID-19 Seroconversion in Emergency Professionals at an Urban Academic Emergency Department in New York City,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To describe nurse hand hygiene practices in the home health care (HHC) setting, nurse adherence to hand hygiene guidelines, and factors associated with hand hygiene opportunities during home care visits. DESIGN: Observational study of nurse hand hygiene practices. SETTING: and Participants: Licensed practical/vocational and registered nurses were observed in the homes of patients being served by a large nonprofit HHC agency. METHODS: Two researchers observed 400 home care visits conducted by 50 nurses. The World Health Organization's ""5 Moments for Hand Hygiene"" validated observation tool was used to record opportunities and actual practices of hand hygiene, with 3 additional opportunities specific to the HHC setting. Patient assessment data available in the agency electronic health record and a nurse demographic questionnaire were also collected to describe patients and nurse participants. RESULTS: A total of 2014 opportunities were observed. On arrival in the home was the most frequent opportunity (n = 384), the least frequent was after touching a patient's surroundings (n = 43). The average hand hygiene adherence rate was 45.6% after adjusting for clustering at the nurse level. Adherence was highest after contact with body fluid (65.1%) and lowest after touching a patient (29.5%). The number of hand hygiene opportunities was higher when patients being served were at increased risk of an infection-related emergency department visit or hospitalization and when the home environment was observed to be ""dirty."" No nurse or patient demographic characteristics were associated with the rate of nurse hand hygiene adherence. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Hand hygiene adherence in HHC is suboptimal, with rates mirroring those reported in hospital and outpatient settings. The connection between poor hand hygiene and infection transmission has been well studied, and it has received widespread attention with the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2. Agencies can use results found in this study to better inform quality improvement initiatives.","McDonald, Margaret V; Brickner, Carlin; Russell, David; Dowding, Dawn; Larson, Elaine L; Trifilio, Marygrace; Bick, Irene Y; Sridharan, Sridevi; Song, Jiyoun; Adams, Victoria; Woo, Kyungmi; Shang, Jingjing",J.

In this study, PA obtained using slow pyrolysis method and fractionated using column chromatography was characterized (chemical and antioxidative properties) and investigated for its cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) inhibition activities using the in vitro and in silico approaches. The F9 PA fraction exhibited highest total phenolic content of 181.75 ± 17.0 µg/mL. Fraction F21-25 showed ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) (331.80 ± 4.60 mg TE/g) and IC50 of 18.56 ± 0.01 µg/mL towards COX-2 and 5.25 ± 0.03 µg/mL towards the 5-LOX enzymes, respectively. Molecular docking analysis suggested favourable binding energy for all chemical compounds present in fraction F21-25, notably 1-(2,4,6-trihydroxyphenyl)-2-pentanone, towards both COX-2 (- 6.9 kcal/mol) and 5-LOX (- 6.4 kcal/mol) enzymes. As a conclusion, PA from PKS has the potential to be used as an alternative antioxidant and antiinflammatory agents which is biodegradable and a more sustainable supply of raw materials.","Rabiu, Zainab; Hamzah, Mohd Amir Asyraf Mohd; Hasham, Rosnani; Zakaria, Zainul Akmar",,,254

The architecture is based on a simple base learner and multiple boosting systems that are modelled as a single deep neural network. The architecture transforms the original multivariate time series into multiple cascading univariate time series. Together with sparse interactions, parameter sharing and equivariant representations, this approach makes it possible to combat against overfitting while still achieving good presentation power with a deep network architecture. The architecture is evaluated in several short-term load forecasting tasks with energy data from an office building in Finland. The proposed architecture outperforms state-of-the-art load forecasting model in all the tasks.","Salmi, Tuukka; Kiljander, Jussi; Pakkala, Daniel",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.08406v2.pdf,254

To address the volatility and noise, we utilize a deep learning stock market prediction model based on investors' sentiments, which allows us to better understand the direction the market will shift, improving the model prediction accuracy. We adopt an LSTM recurrent neural network because of its advantages in analyzing time-series data through its memory function and utilize an attention mechanism to focus the model on critical information. Experimental data demonstrate that utilizing the investors' emotional tendencies and the attention mechanism can help LSTM to predict closing prices despite the uncertainty of the pandemic.

377697,"Abstracts for the 46th Annual Conference of the International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes (ISPAD), October 15-17, 2020, Virtual",2021,"OBJECTIVES: The aims of our study were to describe the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown on primary care in Germany regarding the number of consultations, the prevalence of specific reasons for consultation presented by the patients, and the frequency of specific services performed by the GP. METHODS: We conducted a longitudinal observational study based on standardised GP interviews in a quota sampling design comparing the time before the COVID-19 pandemic (12 June 2015 to 27 April 2017) with the time during lockdown (21 April to 14 July 2020). The sample included GPs in urban and rural areas 120 km around Hamburg, Germany, and was stratified by region type and administrative districts. Differences in the consultation numbers were analysed by multivariate linear regressions in mixed models adjusted for random effects on the levels of the administrative districts and GP practices. RESULTS: One hundred ten GPs participated in the follow-up, corresponding to 52.1% of the baseline. Primary care practices in 32 of the 37 selected administrative districts (86.5%) could be represented in both assessments. At baseline, GPs reported 199.6 ± 96.9 consultations per week, which was significantly reduced during COVID-19 lockdown by 49.0% to 101.8 ± 67.6 consultations per week (p < 0.001). During lockdown, the frequency of five reasons for consultation (-43.0% to -31.5%) and eleven services (-56.6% to -33.5%) had significantly decreased. The multilevel, multivariable analyses showed an average reduction of 94.6 consultations per week (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: We observed a dramatic reduction of the number of consultations in primary care. This effect was independent of age, sex and specialty of the GP and independent of the practice location in urban or rural areas. Consultations for complaints like low back pain, gastrointestinal complaints, vertigo or fatigue and services like house calls/calls at nursing homes, wound treatments, pain therapy or screening examinations for the early detection of chronic diseases were particularly affected.","Schäfer, Ingmar; Hansen, Heike; Menzel, Agata; Eisele, Marion; Tajdar, Daniel; Lühmann, Dagmar; Scherer, Martin",BMC Fam Pract,,254

In this paper, we develop a Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline that is capable of automatically distilling various digital articles into manageable pieces of information, while also modelling the progression topics discussed over time in order to aid readers in rapidly gaining holistic perspectives on pressing issues (i.e., the COVID-19 pandemic) from a diverse array of sources. We achieve these goals by first collecting a large corpus of COVID-related articles during the onset of the pandemic. After, we apply unsupervised and semi-supervised learning procedures to summarize articles, then cluster them based on their similarities using the community detection methods. Next, we identify the topic of each cluster of articles using the BART algorithm. Finally, we provide a detailed digital media analysis based on the NLP-pipeline outputs and show how the conversation surrounding COVID-19 evolved over time.","Wan, Xiangpeng; Lucic, Michael C.; Ghazzai, Hakim; Massoud, Yehia",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.09572v1.pdf,254

DESIGN: Nationwide seroepidemiological study. SETTING: First wave of covid-19 pandemic in Spain. PARTICIPANTS: Community dwelling individuals of all ages. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The main outcome measure was overall, and age and sex specific, infection fatality risk for SARS-CoV-2 (the number of covid-19 deaths and excess deaths divided by the estimated number of SARS-CoV-2 infections) in the community dwelling Spanish population. Deaths with laboratory confirmed covid-19 were obtained from the National Epidemiological Surveillance Network (RENAVE) and excess all cause deaths from the Monitoring Mortality System (MoMo), up to 15 July 2020. SARS-CoV-2 infections in Spain were derived from the estimated seroprevalence by a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay for IgG antibodies in 61 098 participants in the ENE-COVID nationwide seroepidemiological survey between 27 April and 22 June 2020. RESULTS: The overall infection fatality risk was 0.8% (19 228 of 2.3 million infected individuals, 95% confidence interval 0.8% to 0.9%) for confirmed covid-19 deaths and 1.1% (24 778 of 2.3 million infected individuals, 1.0% to 1.2%) for excess deaths. The infection fatality risk was 1.1% (95% confidence interval 1.0% to 1.2%) to 1.4% (1.3% to 1.5%) in men and 0.6% (0.5% to 0.6%) to 0.8% (0.7% to 0.8%) in women. The infection fatality risk increased sharply after age 50, ranging from 11.6% (8.1% to 16.5%) to 16.4% (11.4% to 23.2%) in men aged 80 or more and from 4.6% (3.4% to 6.3%) to 6.5% (4.7% to 8.8%) in women aged 80 or more. CONCLUSION: The increase in SARS-CoV-2 infection fatality risk after age 50 appeared to be more noticeable in men than in women. Based on the results of this study, fatality from covid-19 was greater than that reported for other common respiratory diseases, such as seasonal influenza.","Pastor-Barriuso, Roberto; Pérez-Gómez, Beatriz; Hernán, Miguel A; Pérez-Olmeda, Mayte; Yotti, Raquel; Oteo-Iglesias, Jesús; Sanmartín, Jose L; León-Gómez, Inmaculada; Fernández-García, Aurora; Fernández-Navarro, Pablo; Cruz, Israel; Martín, Mariano; Delgado-Sanz, Concepción; Fernández de Larrea, Nerea; León Paniagua, Jose; Muñoz-Montalvo, Juan F; Blanco, Faustino; Larrauri, Amparo; Pollán, Marina",BMJ,,254
389125,Acetic acid disinfection as a potential adjunctive therapy for non-severe COVID-19,2020,"OBJECTIVES: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is a lifesaving therapy for patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome refractory to conventional mechanical ventilation. It is frequently complicated by both thrombosis and hemorrhage. A markedly prothrombotic state associated with high rates of venous thromboembolism has been described in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (coronavirus disease 2019) infection. These rates have currently not been described during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in comparison to other viral pneumonias. DESIGN: Retrospective observational study. SETTING: Single high-volume tertiary critical care department at a university hospital. PATIENTS: Patients 16 years old or greater receiving venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation between March 1, 2020, and May 31, 2020, with coronavirus disease 2019 were compared with a cohort of patients with influenza pneumonia between June 1, 2012, and May 31, 2020. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The rates of venous thromboembolism and hemorrhage were compared in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 against a historic population of patients with influenza pneumonia who required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. There were 51 patients who received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation due to coronavirus disease 2019 and 80 patients with influenza. At cannulation for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, 37% of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 compared with 8% of patients with influenza had filling defects on CT pulmonary angiography (p = 0.0001). Catheter-associated deep vein thrombosis shown on ultrasound Doppler after decannulation was present in 53% with coronavirus disease 2019 versus 25% with influenza (p = 0.01). The rates of intracranial hemorrhage at the time of cannulation were 16% with coronavirus disease 2019 and 14% with influenza (p = 0.8). Elevated D-dimer levels were seen in both conditions and were significantly higher in those with pulmonary thromboembolism than those without in coronavirus disease 2019 (p = 0.02). Fibrinogen and C-reactive protein levels were significantly higher in those with coronavirus disease 2019 than influenza (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Significant rates of pulmonary thromboembolism and of catheter-associated deep vein thrombosis were seen in both viral infections but were greater in those requiring the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in coronavirus disease 2019 than for influenza.","Doyle, Andrew J; Hunt, Beverley J; Sanderson, Barnaby; Zhang, Joseph; Mak, Sze M; Benedetti, Guilia; Breen, Karen A; Camporota, Luigi; Barrett, Nicholas A; Retter, Andrew",Crit. care med,,254

Subject and methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted from 5 May to 25 May 2020. People aged between 18 and 35 years were approached via social media to complete an online questionnaire that consisted of socio-demographic information and KAP toward COVID-19. Descriptive statistics, t-tests, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and multiple logistic regression analyses were conducted. Results: Out of 707 survey participants, 57.1% were male, the majority were students (60.3%), aged 24-29 years (61.5%), having a bachelor's degree (57%), having family income 25,000-50,000 BDT (40.5%) and living in urban areas (64.4%). Participants gathered information on COVID-19 mostly through social media (70.4%). Overall, 61.2% had adequate knowledge with 78.9% having a positive attitudes toward COVID-19 and only 51.6% had good practices. Most (86.8%) of the participants were confident that COVID-19 will be successfully controlled and Bangladesh was handling the COVID-19 health crisis well (84.20%). Only 75.2% of participants always washed their hands with soap or hand-sanitizer, and 70.6% wore a mask when going outside the home. Factors associated with adequate knowledge were being female, having a master's degree and above, and living in an urban area (p < 0.05). Participants having adequate knowledge of COVID-19 had higher likelihood of positive attitudes (OR: 6.41, 95% CI = 2.34-25.56, p = 0.000) and good practices (OR: 8.93, 95% CI = 3.92-38.42, p = 0.000). Conclusion: The findings highlight the need for tailored education programs for COVID-19 which incorporates consideration of associated factors to improve the level of public knowledge, attitudes, and practices.","Banik, Rajon; Rahman, Mahmudur; Sikder, Md Tajuddin; Rahman, Quazi Maksudur; Pranta, Mamun Ur Rashid",Z Gesundh Wiss,,254
392174,Ketoacidosis in children and adolescents with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes during the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany-results from a nationwide registry,2021,"During the first 90 days of the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States, over 675,000 confirmed cases of the disease have been reported, posing unprecedented socioeconomic burden to the country. Due to inadequate research on geographic modeling of COVID-19, we investigated county-level variations of disease incidence across the continental United States. We compiled a geodatabase of 35 environmental, socioeconomic, topographic, and demographic variables that could explain the spatial variability of disease incidence. Further, we employed spatial lag and spatial error models to investigate spatial dependence and geographically weighted regression (GWR) and multiscale GWR (MGWR) models to locally examine spatial non-stationarity. The results suggested that even though incorporating spatial autocorrelation could significantly improve the performance of the global ordinary least square model, these models still represent a significantly poor performance compared to the local models. Moreover, MGWR could explain the highest variations (adj. R2: 68.1%) with the lowest AICc compared to the others. Mapping the effects of significant explanatory variables (i.e., income inequality, median household income, the proportion of black females, and the proportion of nurse practitioners) on spatial variability of COVID-19 incidence rates using MGWR could provide useful insights to policymakers for targeted interventions.","Mollalo, Abolfazl; Vahedi, Behzad; Rivera, Kiara M",Sci Total Environ,,254

The European Myeloma Network has provided an expert consensus statement in order to guide therapeutic decisions in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic. Patient education for personal hygiene and social distancing measures, along with treatment individualization, telemedicine and continuous surveillance for early diagnosis of COVID-19 are essential. In countries or local communities where COVID-19 infection is widely spread, MM patients should have a PCR test of nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 before hospital admission, starting a new treatment line, cell apheresis or ASCT in order to avoid ward or community spread and infections. Oral agent-based regimens should be considered, especially for the elderly and frail patients with standard risk disease, whereas de-intensified regimens for dexamethasone, bortezomib, carfilzomib and daratumumab should be used based on patient risk and response. Treatment initiation should not be postponed for patients with end organ damage, myeloma emergencies and aggressive relapses. Autologous (and especially allogeneic) transplantation should be delayed and extended induction should be administered, especially in standard risk patients and those with adequate MM response to induction. Watchful waiting should be considered for standard risk relapsed patients with low tumor burden, and slow biochemical relapses. The conduction of clinical trials should continue with appropriate adaptations to the current circumstances. Patients with MM and symptomatic COVID-19 disease should interrupt anti-myeloma treatment until recovery. For patients with positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2, but with no symptoms for COVID-19, a 14-day quarantine should be considered if myeloma-related events allow the delay of treatment. The need for surveillance for drug interactions due to polypharmacy is highlighted.

LUS may be useful in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19. METHODS: This study was conducted at two United States hospitals from 3/21/2020 to 6/01/2020. Our inclusion criteria included hospitalized adults with COVID-19 (based on symptomatology and a confirmatory RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2) who received a LUS. Providers used a 12-zone LUS scanning protocol. The images were interpreted by the researchers based on a pre-developed consensus document. Patients were stratified by clinical deterioration (defined as either ICU admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, or death within 28 days from the initial symptom onset) and time from symptom onset to their scan. RESULTS: N = 22 patients (N = 36 scans) were included. Eleven (50%) patients experienced clinical deterioration. Among N = 36 scans, only 3 (8%) were classified as normal. The remaining scans demonstrated B-lines (89%), consolidations (56%), pleural thickening (47%), and pleural effusion (11%). Scans from patients with clinical deterioration demonstrated higher percentages of bilateral consolidations (50 versus 15%; P = .033), anterior consolidations (47 versus 11%; P = .047), lateral consolidations (71 versus 29%; P = .030), pleural thickening (69 versus 30%; P = .045), but not B-lines (100 versus 80%; P = .11). Abnormal findings had similar prevalences between scans collected 0-6 days and 14-28 days from symptom onset. DISCUSSION: Certain LUS findings may be common in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, especially for those that experience clinical deterioration. These findings may occur anytime throughout the first 28 days of illness. Future efforts should investigate the predictive utility of these findings on clinical outcomes.","Kumar, Andre; Weng, Yingjie; Duanmu, Youyou; Graglia, Sally; Lalani, Farhan; Gandhi, Kavita; Lobo, Viveta; Jensen, Trevor; Chung, Sukyung; Nahn, Jeffrey; Kugler, John",J. ultrasound med,,254
406580,"Do People Actually ""Listen to the Experts""? A Cautionary Note on Assuming Expert Credibility and Persuasiveness on Public Health Policy Advocacy",2020,"The vampire bat (Desmodus rotundus) is a haematophagous animal that feeds exclusively on the blood of domestic mammals. Vampire bat feeding habits enable their contact with mammalian hosts and may enhance zoonotic spillover. Moreover, they may carry several pathogenic organisms, including coronaviruses (CoVs), for which they are important hosts. The human pathogens that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and possibly coronavirus disease 2019 (SARS-CoV-2) all originated in bats but required bridge hosts to spread into human populations. To monitor the presence of potential zoonotic viruses in bats, the present work evaluated the presence of CoVs in vampire bats from southern Brazil. A total of 101 vampire bats were captured and euthanized between 2017 and 2019 in Rio Grande do Sul state, southern Brazil. The brain, heart, liver, lungs, kidneys and intestines were collected and macerated individually. The samples were pooled and submitted to high-throughput sequencing (HTS) using the Illumina MiSeq platform and subsequently individually screened using a pancoronavirus RT-PCR protocol. We detected CoV-related sequences in HTS, but only two (2/101; 1.98%) animals had CoV detected in the intestines by RT-PCR. Partial sequences of RdRp and spike genes were obtained in the same sample and the RdRp region in the other sample. The sequences were classified as belonging to Alphacoronavirus. The sequences were closely related to alphacoronaviruses detected in vampire bats from Peru. The continuous monitoring of bat CoVs may help to map and predict putative future zoonotic agents with great impacts on human health.","Alves, Raquel Silva; do Canto Olegário, Juliana; Weber, Matheus Nunes; da Silva, Mariana Soares; Canova, Raissa; Sauthier, Jéssica Tatiane; Baumbach, Letícia Ferreira; Witt, André Alberto; Varela, Ana Paula Muterle; Mayer, Fabiana Quoos; da Fontoura Budaszewski, Renata; Canal, Cláudio Wageck",Transbound. emerg. dis.

407198,Coronavirus and Obesity: Could Insulin Resistance Mediate the Severity of Covid-19 Infection?,2020,"BACKGROUND: With large numbers of COVID-19 patients requiring mechanical ventilation and ventilators possibly being in short supply, in extremis two patients may have to share one ventilator. Careful matching of patient ventilation requirements is necessary. However, good matching is difficult to achieve as lung characteristics can have a wide range and may vary over time. Adding flow restriction to the flow path between ventilator and patient gives the opportunity to control the airway pressure and hence flow and volume individually for each patient. This study aimed to create and validate a simple model for calculating required flow restriction. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We created a simple linear resistance-compliance model, termed the BathRC model, of the ventilator tubing system and lung allowing direct calculation of the relationships between pressures, volumes, and required flow restriction. Experimental measurements were made for parameter determination and validation using a clinical ventilator connected to two test lungs. For validation, differing amounts of restriction were introduced into the ventilator circuit. The BathRC model was able to predict tidal lung volumes with a mean error of 4% (min:1.2%, max:9.3%). CONCLUSION: We present a simple model validated model that can be used to estimate required flow restriction for dual patient ventilation.

407536,Caution Warranted: Using the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation Model for Predicting the Course of the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"Strategic Human Resources Management is one of the concepts of how HR management should be carried out in the organization. The strategic HRM approach shows how the organization's goals will be achieved through competent individuals through various HR strategies and integrating HR policies and practices. Consequently, HR professionals must understand various activities that have strategic value. However, various studies have shown that human resources have not optimized achieving performance at the organizational level. Various factors become a black box in determining the extent to which HR can contribute strategically. Creativity and innovation, including the ability to act fast and agile, become imperative for an organization to survive. It is all in the hands of employee that exist in the organization. The Covid-19 pandemic event is momentum for all HR professionals to rethink the extent to which the organization's HR system has been strategic. © 2021 Karadeniz Technical University.

408640,169 Emergency Department Utilization Trends during the COVID-19,2020,"Due to the sudden emergence of the novel coronavirus as a worldwide pandemic, this study aimed to evaluate the awareness and practices of both the Jordanian and Iraqi populations during the early stages of the pandemic. A cross-sectional survey was conducted between the 19th and 22nd of March to assess the public's awareness toward COVID-19. Multiple scored domains were used to assess the differences between the two populations. Statistical analysis was conducted to reveal the influence of sociodemographic variables on these scores. A total of 3167 participants were recruited in the study, of which, 1599 (50.5%) were from Jordan and 1568 (49.5%) were from Iraq. More than half of the Jordanian (56.8%) and Iraqi participants (53.2%) showed average or adequate awareness about COVID-19. More than 60% of both populations relied on medical staff for COVID-19 related information. Social media was the second most common COVID-19 information source, as it was reported by 53.7% of Jordanian participants and 62.8% of Iraqi participants. More than 90% of both populations participated in precautionary measurements. Finally, about 20% of both populations failed to recognize droplet inhalation as a source of transmission. Despite the portrayed awareness levels, governmental involvement is warranted to increase the public's awareness and fill the gaps within their knowledge.","Jaber, Ruba M; Mafrachi, Baraa; Al-Ani, Abdallah; Shkara, Mustafa",PLoS One,,254

In this paper, a novel six-phase DFIG through Asymmetrical Winding Structure is developed to extract electric power from the wind energy generation system (WEGS) Due to the spread of pandemic disease (Covid-19), the attention of power engineers is increasing toward the reliability (in terms of fault tolerance capability) of AC generators The principle contribution of this manuscript is the modeling (mathematical and simulation-based modeling) of novel asymmetrical six phase doubly fed induction generator (ASPDFIG) Furthermore, this paper presents the complete modeling of WEGS which contains the modeling of supporting components (6-phsase transformer, appropriate rotor side converter, grid side converter, dc link etc ), aerodynamic system In addition to modeling, the analysis, and the controlling strategy for ASPDFIG, wind turbine also discussed The elegant advantages such as fault tolerance, high efficiency, reduced torque pulsation and reduced per leg converter rating of ASPDFIG are also discussed The simulation results, particularly the stator voltage, phase current, active and reactive power, are given to validate the theoretic investigation","Mishra, Neeraj Kumar; Husain, Zakir; Iqwal, Atif",International Transactions on Electrical Energy Systems,,254
409939,287 Likelihood of COVID-19 Positive Test Results in Patients Who Present to the Emergency Department With Key COVID Chief Symptoms,2020,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The currently active COVID-19 pandemic has increased, among others, public interest in the computational techniques enabling the study of disease-spreading processes. Thus far, numerous approaches have been used to study the development of epidemics, with special attention paid to the identification of crucial elements that can strengthen or weaken the dynamics of the process. The main thread of this research is associated with the use of the ordinary differential equations method. There also exist several approaches based on the analysis of flows in the Cellular Automata (CA) approach. METHODS: In this paper, we propose a new approach to disease-spread modeling. We start by creating a network that reproduces contacts between individuals in a community. This assumption makes the presented model significantly different from the ones currently dominant in the field. It also changes the approach to the act of infection. Usually, some parameters that describe the rate of new infections by taking into account those infected in the previous time slot are considered. With our model, we can individualize this process, considering each contact individually. RESULTS: The typical output from calculations of a similar type are epidemic curves. In our model, except of presenting the average curves, we show the deviations or ranges for particular results obtained in different simulation runs, which usually lead to significantly different results. This observation is the effect of the probabilistic character of the infection process, which can impact, in different runs, individuals with different significance to the community. We can also easily present the effects of different types of intervention. The effects are studied for different methods used to create the graph representing a community, which can correspond to different social bonds. CONCLUSIONS: We see the potential usefulness of the proposition in the detailed study of epidemic development for specific environments and communities. The ease of entering new parameters enables the analysis of several specific scenarios for different contagious diseases.","Gwizdalla, Tomasz",Comput Methods Programs Biomed,,254
409972,Diabetes during the COVID-19 pandemic: A global call to reconnect with patients and emphasize lifestyle changes and optimize glycemic and blood pressure control,2020,"The Fc portion of immunoglobulin G (IgG) promotes defensive effector functions in the immune system by interacting with FcÎ³ receptors and complement component C1q. These interactions critically depend on N-glycosylation at Asn297 of each CH2 domain, where biantennary complex-type oligosaccharides contain microheterogeneities resulting primarily from the presence or absence of non-reducing terminal galactose residues. Crystal structures of Fc have shown that a pair of N-glycans is located between the two CH2 domains. Here we applied our metabolic isotope labeling technique using mammalian cells for in-solution structural characterization of mouse IgG2b-Fc glycoforms with a molecular mass of 54 kDa. Based on spectral assignments of the N-glycans as well as polypeptide backbones of Fc, we probed conformational perturbations of Fc induced by N-glycan trimming, especially enzymatic degalactosylation. The results indicated that degalactosylation structurally perturbed the Fc region through rearrangement of glycan-protein interactions. The spectral assignments of IgG2b-Fc glycoprotein will provide the basis for NMR investigation of its dynamic conformations and interactions with effector molecules in solution.","Yanaka, Saeko; Yamaguchi, Yoshiki; Takizawa, Takeshi; Miyanoiri, Yohei; Yogo, Rina; Shimada, Ichio; Kato, Koichi",Biomolecular NMR assignments,,254
409973,Diabetes during the COVID-19 pandemic: A global call to reconnect with patients and emphasize lifestyle changes and optimize glycemic and blood pressure control,2020,"ABSTRACT All who have experienced the global pandemic of 2020 can tell you that we live in a changed world. People no longer question whether we are in complexity, that reality has been made explicitly clear. What they want to know now is, what do we do about it, and what does it mean for how we need to lead differently? In this article I explore these questions by integrating generative emergence (Lichtenstein, B. [2014]. Generative emergence: A new discipline of organizational, entrepreneurial, and social innovation. Oxford University Press) and complexity leadership theory (CLT) (Uhl-Bien, M., Marion, R., & McKelvey, B. [2007]. Complexity leadership theory: Shifting leadership from the industrial age to the knowledge era. The Leadership Quarterly, 18(4), 298-318. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.leaqua.2007.04.002). Using COVID-19 as an example, I show how understanding complexity leadership theory as generative emergence can help us better understand how to lead differently in crisis and complexity. Doing so requires that research and practice focus on developing leaders and followers who can respond by adapting, rather than denying or retreating, in the face of complexity pressures. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved) MAD statement The global pandemic of 2020 has made it clear that we need to place more emphasis on developing leaders and followers who can lead in complexity. This paper does this by using examples from COVID-19 to show the difference between successful and unsuccessful pandemic leadership. Successful leadership has leaders and followers who co-create adaptive responses that use complexity leadership to enable generative emergence. Unsuccessful pandemic leadership turned to order responses that denied the reality of the situation and tried to wish it away, leading to disastrous outcomes and hundreds of thousands of needless deaths.

411229,185 Data-Driven Staffing Decision-Making at an Emergency Department in Response to COVID-19,2020,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Sequencing the viral genome as the outbreak progresses is important, particularly in the identification of emerging isolates with different pathogenic potential and to identify whether nucleotide changes in the genome will impair clinical diagnostic tools such as real-time PCR assays. Although single nucleotide polymorphisms and point mutations occur during the replication of coronaviruses, one of the biggest drivers in genetic change is recombination. This can manifest itself in insertions and/or deletions in the viral genome. Therefore, sequencing strategies that underpin molecular epidemiology and inform virus biology in patients should take these factors into account. A long amplicon/read length-based RT-PCR sequencing approach focused on the Oxford Nanopore MinION/GridION platforms was developed to identify and sequence the SARS-CoV-2 genome in samples from patients with or suspected of COVID-19. The protocol, termed Rapid Sequencing Long Amplicons (RSLAs) used random primers to generate cDNA from RNA purified from a sample from a patient, followed by single or multiplex PCRs to generate longer amplicons of the viral genome. The base protocol was used to identify SARS-CoV-2 in a variety of clinical samples and proved sensitive in identifying viral RNA in samples from patients that had been declared negative using other nucleic acid-based assays (false negative). Sequencing the amplicons revealed that a number of patients had a proportion of viral genomes with deletions.","Moore, Shona C; Penrice-Randal, Rebekah; Alruwaili, Muhannad; Randle, Nadine; Armstrong, Stuart; Hartley, Catherine; Haldenby, Sam; Dong, Xiaofeng; Alrezaihi, Abdulrahman; Almsaud, Mai; Bentley, Eleanor; Clark, Jordan; García-Dorival, Isabel; Gilmore, Paul; Han, Ximeng; Jones, Benjamin; Luu, Lisa; Sharma, Parul; Shawli, Ghada; Sun, Yani; Zhao, Qin; Pullan, Steven T; Carter, Daniel P; Bewley, Kevin; Dunning, Jake; Zhou, En-Min; Solomon, Tom; Beadsworth, Michael; Cruise, James; Crook, Derrick W; Matthews, David A; Davidson, Andrew D; Mahmood, Zana; Aljabr, Waleed; Druce, Julian; Vipond, Richard; Ng, Lisa; Renia, Laurent; Openshaw, Peter J M; Baillie, J Kenneth; Carroll, Miles W; Stewart, James; Darby, Alistair; Semple, Malcolm; Turtle, Lance; Hiscox, Julian A",Viruses,,254
411724,Thromboembolic events in pregnant and puerperal women after COVID-19 lockdowns: A retrospective cohort study,2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on health-care systems and potentially on pregnancy outcomes, but no systematic synthesis of evidence of this effect has been undertaken. We aimed to assess the collective evidence on the effects on maternal, fetal, and neonatal outcomes of the pandemic. METHODS: We did a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies on the effects of the pandemic on maternal, fetal, and neonatal outcomes. We searched MEDLINE and Embase in accordance with PRISMA guidelines, from Jan 1, 2020, to Jan 8, 2021, for case-control studies, cohort studies, and brief reports comparing maternal and perinatal mortality, maternal morbidity, pregnancy complications, and intrapartum and neonatal outcomes before and during the pandemic. We also planned to record any additional maternal and offspring outcomes identified. Studies of solely SARS-CoV-2-infected pregnant individuals, as well as case reports, studies without comparison groups, narrative or systematic literature reviews, preprints, and studies reporting on overlapping populations were excluded. Quantitative meta-analysis was done for an outcome when more than one study presented relevant data. Random-effects estimate of the pooled odds ratio (OR) of each outcome were generated with use of the Mantel-Haenszel method. This review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020211753). FINDINGS: The search identified 3592 citations, of which 40 studies were included. We identified significant increases in stillbirth (pooled OR 1·28 [95% CI 1·07-1·54]; I2=63%; 12 studies, 168 295 pregnancies during and 198 993 before the pandemic) and maternal death (1·37 [1·22-1·53; I2=0%, two studies [both from low-income and middle-income countries], 1 237 018 and 2 224 859 pregnancies) during versus before the pandemic. Preterm births before 37 weeks' gestation were not significantly changed overall (0·94 [0·87-1·02]; I2=75%; 15 studies, 170 640 and 656 423 pregnancies) but were decreased in high-income countries (0·91 [0·84-0·99]; I2=63%; 12 studies, 159 987 and 635 118 pregnancies), where spontaneous preterm birth was also decreased (0·81 [0·67-0·97]; two studies, 4204 and 6818 pregnancies). Mean Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale scores were higher, indicating poorer mental health, during versus before the pandemic (pooled mean difference 0·42 [95% CI 0·02-0·81; three studies, 2330 and 6517 pregnancies). Surgically managed ectopic pregnancies were increased during the pandemic (OR 5·81 [2·16-15·6]; I2=26%; three studies, 37 and 272 pregnancies). No overall significant effects were identified for other outcomes included in the quantitative analysis: maternal gestational diabetes; hypertensive disorders of pregnancy; preterm birth before 34 weeks', 32 weeks', or 28 weeks' gestation; iatrogenic preterm birth; labour induction; modes of delivery (spontaneous vaginal delivery, caesarean section, or instrumental delivery); post-partum haemorrhage; neonatal death; low birthweight (<2500 g); neonatal intensive care unit admission; or Apgar score less than 7 at 5 min. INTERPRETATION: Global maternal and fetal outcomes have worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic, with an increase in maternal deaths, stillbirth, ruptured ectopic pregnancies, and maternal depression. Some outcomes show considerable disparity between high-resource and low-resource settings. There is an urgent need to prioritise safe, accessible, and equitable maternity care within the strategic response to this pandemic and in future health crises.

414751,Comment prendre le pas sur le coronavirus dans un pays en développement: questions et actions au Burkina Faso,2020,"Abstract In 2020, governments were faced with addressing the health crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, without certainty about what would work best to reduce the health crisis without ruining the economy. Through all the uncertainty, national governments based their responses to COVID-19 on beliefs and political ideas, which was reflected on the diversity of the responses: liberal, authoritarian, centralized, decentralized, transparent, or opaque. In this article we focus on one of these responses, populism, and seek to understand how populist beliefs drive bureaucratic actions taken by a populist government to handle the health crisis. We conducted a comparative case study between the Mexican populist federal government and the non-populist Jalisco state government. Our findings suggest that the administrative actions chosen by the Mexican populist government were based on negative beliefs towards expert scientific knowledge from outside the government; a disinterest in searching for more information from distant or unfamiliar sources; and a strengthening of flagship programs as the main way to address the upcoming economic crisis. We also found that the Mexican government shows a peculiar manifestation of populism, which we refer as downsizing populism. Our article advances our understanding about how populism may affect the form and function of bureaucracies.","Renteria, Cesar; Arellano-Gault, David",Rev. adm. pública (Online),,254

METHODS: A total of 125 consecutive patients over 20â¯years of age who were hospitalized for SARS - COV - 2 between 20th March 2020 and 18th May 2020 were included in the study. The data of the patients in the inpatient ward and in the intensive care unit were recorded separately. The duration of QRS and presence of FQRS were evaluated by two experienced cardiologists. The patients were divided into two groups as FQRS positive and FQRS negative considering presence of FQRS. Moreover, the frequency of FQRS in the patients in the inpatient ward and in the intensive care unit were compared with each other. RESULTS: FQRS was found in 24% of the patients who had SARS-COV-2. There was no difference between FQRS positive and negative groups in terms of age and gender. Heart rate was higher in FQRS positive group. C-reactive protein (7.25â¯±â¯6.65â¯mg/dl vs. 4.80â¯±â¯4.48â¯mg/dl; pâ¯=â¯.02) levels were also significantly higher in the FQRS positive group. In patients with SARS-COV-2, intensive care unit requirement increased with increasing levels of troponin (pâ¯<â¯.000). A positive correlation was detected between serum CRP levels and FQRS (râ¯=â¯0.204, pâ¯=â¯.024). CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of FQRS is high in patients with SARS - COV - 2. Serum CRP levels increase with increasing frequency of FQRS in patients with SARS - COV - 2 indicating that patients with FQRS are exposed to more inflammation. Presence of FQRS in SARS - COV - 2 patients may be useful in predicting cardiovascular outcomes.","Bektas, Osman; Çerik, Idris Bugra; Çerik, Hatun Öztürk; Karagöz, Ahmet; Kaya, Yasemin; Dereli, Seçkin; Kaya, Ahmet; Dogan, Ahmet",J Electrocardiol,,254

417414,Weight change and glycemic control in type 2 diabetes patients during COVID-19 pandemic: the lockdown effect,2021,"BACKGROUND: The prevalence of sesame food allergy (SFA) is increasing worldwide with the potential of anaphylactic reactions upon exposure. Utility of specific component IgE testing as an alternative to the oral food challenge (OFC), the diagnostic standard, is being investigated. METHODS: Patients (n=42) with suspected SFA completed an open OFC to sesame. Diagnostic testing included serum levels of Ses i 1-specific IgE, skin prick test with high-protein extract, and basophil reactivity (% induced CD63 expression) for each patient. The diagnostic utility of these tests was evaluated at a 95% sensitivity, with the outcome measure being the number of OFCs required. RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients (64%) were diagnosed with SFA. Ses i 1-IgE differed significantly between allergic and tolerant patients (p=0.0001). ROC curve analysis for Ses i 1-IgE yielded an AUC of 0.88 ±0.05. Levels of Ses i1-IgE correlated to induced CD63+ expression on basophils (p =0.0001). Ses i1-IgE was not sufficiently robust as a single step for diagnosis. Used concurrently, BAT and Ses i 1-IgE, yielded correct positive classifications for 25 of 27 sesame allergic patients with two false positives (93% PPV). Both tests were negative in 5 nonallergic patients. Patients with divergent Ses i 1-IgE and BAT results required OFC (n=10, 24% of patients). Alternatively, sequential use of BAT, ruling in SFA followed by Ses i 1-IgE diagnosing nonallergic patients, yielded a 89% PPV, with 19% requiring OFC. CONCLUSION: Ses i1-IgE and BAT used together, can decrease the need for OFC in most SFA patients. A prospective cohort trial is necessary to validate these results.","Goldberg, Michael R; Appel, Michael Y; Nachshon, Liat; Holmqvist, Marie; Epstein-Rigbi, Naama; Levy, Michael B; Lidholm, Jonas; Elizur, Arnon",Pediatr. allergy immunol,,254

No amount of talk or deliberation will cure a virus of this scale. If part of the work of cultural studies is to identify the ways a given conjuncture shapes and delimits the felt experience of everyday life, then one charge of our work now is to examine the emergence of those ‘new normals’ that the novel coronavirus has spawned. One of these emergent new configurations of the everyday has been the spread of concerned gestures as a counterpoint to the usual talk talk talk of communicative capitalism. Gestures of concern, from chalking sidewalks to applauding essential workers, build the affective commonwealths that cultivate solidarity in times of protracted precarity. Exceeding Raymond Williams’s notion of ‘structures of feeling,’ affective commonwealths are a resource built from ordinary people whose gestural rituals enact the sorts of worlds that talk alone just can’t bring about. This essay makes a case for the importance of such gestures and suggests they deserve further attention in and beyond the context of the pandemic.","Ingraham, Chris",Cultural Studies,,254

An aerosol containment box that covers the patient's head and neck in bed provides a solution to protect clinicians during aerosol-generating procedures such as intubation. We collaborated with original designer HYL and modified the size to adapt to larger patients and operator mobility. We expand its applicability by allowing the use of different instruments. The container is outfitted with an ultra-low particulate air-equipped filtration vacuum device to create negative pressure within the chamber and actively remove floating droplet nuclei generated during a procedure. This barrier method will be a valuable and economical option to protect healthcare workers on the front line globally during this pandemic and beyond.","Hsu, Steven H; Lai, Hsien Yung; Zabaneh, Firas; Masud, Faisal N",Emerg Med J,,254

While a number of different cardiovascular histopathologies have been reported at postmortem examination, their incidence is unknown, due to limited numbers of cases in any given study. A literature review was performed identifying 277 autopsied hearts across 22 separate publications of COVID-19 positive patients. The median age of the autopsy cohort was 75 and 97.6% had one or more comorbidities. Initial review of the data indicate that myocarditis was present in 20 hearts (7.2%); however, closer examination of additional reported information revealed that most cases were likely not functionally significant and the true prevalence of myocarditis is likely much lower (<2%). At least one acute, potentially COVID-19-related cardiovascular histopathologic finding, such as macro or microvascular thrombi, inflammation, or intraluminal megakaryocytes, was reported in 47.8% of cases. Significant differences in reporting of histopathologic findings occurred between studies indicating strong biases in observations and the need for more consistency in reporting. In conclusion, across 277 cases, COVID-19-related cardiac histopathological findings, are common, while myocarditis is rare.","Halushka, Marc K; Vander Heide, Richard S",Cardiovasc Pathol,,254

A cross-sectional study,2021,"SARS-CoV-2, and several other microorganisms, may be present in nasopharyngeal and salivary secretions in patients treated in dental practices, so an appropriate clinical behavior is required in order to avoid the dangerous spread of infections. COVID-19 could also be spread when patients touches a contaminated surface with infected droplets and then touch their nose, mouth, or eyes. It is time to consider a dental practice quite similar to a hospital surgery room, where particular attention should be addressed to problems related to the spreading of infections due to air and surface contamination. The effectiveness of conventional cleaning and disinfection procedures may be limited by several factors; first of all, human operator dependence seems to be the weak aspect of all procedures. The improvement of these conventional methods requires the modification of human behavior, which is difficult to achieve and sustain. As alternative sterilization methods, there are some that do not depend on the operator, because they are based on devices that perform the entire procedure on their own, with minimal human intervention. In conclusion, continued efforts to improve the traditional manual disinfection of surfaces are needed, so dentists should consider combining the use of proper disinfectants and no-touch decontamination technologies to improve sterilization procedures.","Cumbo, Enzo; Gallina, Giuseppe; Messina, Pietro; Scardina, Giuseppe Alessandro",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,254

Numerous researchers and pharmaceutical companies are working on developing vaccines and treatments; however, a clear solution has yet to be found. The current study proposes the use of artificial intelligence methods to comprehend biomedical knowledge and infer the characteristics of COVID-19. A biomedical knowledge base was established via FastText, a word embedding technique, using PubMed literature from the past decade. Subsequently, a new knowledge base was created using recently published COVID-19 articles. Using this newly constructed knowledge base from the word embedding model, a list of anti-infective drugs and proteins of either human or coronavirus origin were inferred to be related, because they are located close to COVID-19 on the knowledge base. This study attempted to form a method to quickly infer related information about COVID-19 using the existing knowledge base, before sufficient knowledge about COVID-19 is accumulated. With COVID-19 not completely overcome, machine learning-based research in the PubMed literature will provide a broad guideline for researchers and pharmaceutical companies working on treatments for COVID-19.","Yang, Heyoung; Sohn, Eunsoo",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,254

To study the impact of such measures on inter-municipality traffic, we analyze a mobile dataset with the daily flow of people in Portugal in March and April 2020. We find that the reduction in inter-municipality traffic depends strongly on its initial outflow. In municipalities where the mobility is low, the outflow reduced by $10-20\%$ and this decrease was independent of the population size. Whereas, for municipalities of high mobility, the reduction was a monotonic increasing function of the population size and it even exceeded $60\%$ for the largest municipalities. As a consequence of such heterogeneities, there were significant structural changes on the most probable paths for the spreading of the virus, which must be considered when modeling the impact of control measures.","Melo, H.

Cases of liver damage or dysfunction (mainly characterized by moderately elevated serum aspartate aminotransferase levels) have been reported among patients with COVID-19. However, it is currently uncertain whether the COVID-19 related liver damage/dysfunction is due mainly to the viral infection by itself or other coexisting conditions, such as the use of potentially hepatotoxic medications and the coexistence of systemic inflammatory response, respiratory distress syndrome-induced hypoxia, and multiple organ dysfunction. Individuals at high risk for severe COVID-19 are typical of older age and/or present with comorbid conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and hypertension. This is also the same profile for those at increased risk for unrecognized underlying liver disease, especially nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. This could make them more susceptible to liver injury from the virus, medications used in supportive management, or hypoxia. So the aim of this review was to illustrate the clinical implications of COVID-19 on the liver in healthy and diseased states as well as the implications of common liver disorders on the outcome of COVID-19.","Amin, Mona",Eur. j. gastroenterol. hepatol,,254

Previous studies have found that patients have a higher risk of hospitalisation and death than adults in the community. The aim of this project was to improve the care of patients with COVID-19 in psychiatric inpatient settings.MethodA baseline audit was conducted of care COVID-19 patients received in wards that experienced outbreaks in January 2021 in a London Mental Health Trust. Clinical notes were reviewed for management plans, including clear documentation of risk of serious illness, frequency of vitals monitoring, and thresholds for escalation to medical teams.A new protocol was subsequently developed and implemented at one inpatient unit: “COVID-19: Early Identification of Risk and Management”. This included an adjusted 4C mortality score to determine risk of deterioration, and schedules for observation monitoring based on this outcome. Each schedule specified separate frequencies of monitoring of critical observations (oxygen saturations, respiratory rate) and routine observations, thus minimising unnecessary staff exposure. It prompted venous thromboembolism (VTE) assessment and documentation of escalation criteria.Result44 patients were identified across three working age (WAA, n = 29) and two older age (OA, n = 15) adult wards. 7.5% of WAA and 33.3% of OA patients were hospitalised. 20% of OA patients died following a positive test. 58% of patients had a documented management plan for COVID-19, but only 56% mentioned observation frequency, 19% escalation criteria, and 9% risk of serious disease. No patient received a repeat VTE assessment following diagnosis. The audit identified inconsistent approaches to COVID-19 management between wards, and found no relationship between risk of deterioration and frequency of observation monitoring. Following implementation of this protocol, 100% (n = 4) of patients had a robust plan for COVID-19 management, and 100% received a VTE assessment.ConclusionThe audit supported previous findings that psychiatric inpatients are at risk of serious COVID-19 infection. This highlights an urgent clinical and ethical need to optimise COVID-19 care in psychiatric inpatient settings. The results of this audit suggest that risk factors for severe infection and elements of routine care are not widely understood or implemented by clinical staff. Introducing evidence-based protocols to support clinicians in managing the physical healthcare of these patients may be one way of promoting best practice. The improvement in care observed in the pilot study has resulted in this protocol being rolled out across the Trust in an ongoing quality improvement project.","Lewis, Marissa Dionelis Karolos Vecida Miguel Phelps Rebecca Hopwood Helen Lawrence Yong Ng Jason Veeramah Sara Lloyd Miranda Clark Tom",BJPsych Open,,254

Overall, 540 articles included in this study; 75,164 cases of COVID-19 (157 studies), 113,818 influenza type A (251 studies) and 9266 influenza type B patients (47 studies) were included. Runny nose, dyspnoea, sore throat and rhinorrhoea were less frequent symptoms in COVID-19 cases (14%, 15%, 11.5% and 9.5%, respectively) in comparison to influenza type A (70%, 45.5%, 49% and 44.5%, respectively) and type B (74%, 33%, 38% and 49%, respectively). Most of the patients with COVID-19 had abnormal chest radiology (84%, p < 0.001) in comparison to influenza type A (57%, p < 0.001) and B (33%, p < 0.001). The incubation period in COVID-19 (6.4 days estimated) was longer than influenza type A (3.4 days). Likewise, the duration of hospitalization in COVID-19 patients (14 days) was longer than influenza type A (6.5 days) and influenza type B (6.7 days). Case fatality rate of hospitalized patients in COVID-19 (6.5%, p < 0.001), influenza type A (6%, p < 0.001) and influenza type B was 3%(p < 0.001).

432969,“Shh-Don’t say the Q-word” or do you?,2020,"Silphion was an ancient medicinal gum-resin; most likely obtained from a Ferula species growing in the Cyrene region of Libya ca. 2500 years ago. Due to its therapeutic properties and culinary value, silphion became the main economic commodity of the Cyrene region. It is generally believed that the source of silphion became extinct in the first century AD. However, there are a few references in the literature about the cultivated silphion plant and its existence up to the fifth century. Recently, a rare and endemic Ferula species that produces a pleasant-smelling gum-resin was found in three locations near formerly Greek villages in Anatolia. Morphologic features of this species closely resemble silphion, as it appears in the numismatic figures of antique Cyrenaic coins, and conform to descriptions by ancient authors. Initial chemical and pharmacological investigations of this species have confirmed the medicinal and spice-like quality of its gum-resin supporting a connection with the long-lost silphion. A preliminary conservation study has been initiated at the growth site of this rare endemic Ferula species. The results of this study and their implications on the regional extinction event, and future development of this species will be discussed.","Miski, Mahmut",,,254

However, the lowest cutoff diameter of commercially available liquid impingers was about 0.3 m, and the physical collection efficiency for nano-bioaerosol is only about 10-20%. Here, we enhanced the impinger's collection efficiency and recovery of viable viral aerosols by using packed glass beads and selected sampling media (1% peptone and lysogeny broth, LB). Single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) MS2 bacteriophage with uranine (as a physical tracer) was used as model viral aerosols. The effects of different sampling flow rates (4, 6, and 12.5 L per minute) and different sampling time (10, 20, and 30 min) on the collection efficiency and recovery of MS2 aerosols were also tested. Collection efficiency and recovery of viable viral aerosols were analyzed as a function of sampling media, flow rate, and sampling time and packed glass beads by using a general linear model. Although the packed glass beads considerably enhanced the collection efficiency of the liquid impinger for MS2 aerosols, the recovery of viable MS2 becomes lower due to the higher pressure drop across the impinger. Using peptone or LB as sampling media, reducing sampling flow rate, and decreasing sampling time was proven to improve the recovery of viable MS2. Conclusively, this study provides some practical methods to improve the collection efficiency of liquid impinger for viral aerosols and preserve their viability.","Chen, YenChi Wang IJen Cheng ChihChing Wu YuChiao Bai ChunHsuan Yu KuoPin",Aerobiologia,,254

The pathway was first of its kind to be set up in the UK and comprises of a three-tier service model (level 1: specialist MDT service, level 2: community therapy teams and level 3: self-management). The MDT service brings together various disciplines with specialist skill sets to provide targeted individualized interventions using a specific core set of outcome measures including C19-YRS (Yorkshire Rehabilitation Scale). Community and primary care teams worldwide need such an integrated multidisciplinary comprehensive model of care to deal with the growing number of cases of post-COVID-19 syndrome effectively and in a timely manner.","Parkin, Amy; Davison, Jennifer; Tarrant, Rachel; Ross, Denise; Halpin, Stephen; Simms, Alex; Salman, Rashad; Sivan, Manoj",J Prim Care Community Health,,254

440719,Face masks are new normal after COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Today, a new ß-coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2 has emerged and it is causing a global pandemic. Inter-human transmission studies have indicated a significant role of aerosols in the transmission of many respiratory viruses. Hence, it is very important to decrease the spread of the virus through disinfectant agents. This review aimed to provide an overview related to possible alternative inhibitory molecules against this virus. METHOD: For this review the literature search was performed in the MEDLINE electronic database using the public access known as NCBI-PUBMED. Keywords 'coronavirus' and ""SARS-CoV-2"" and ""COVID19"" were used. No specific time range was used. RESULTS: We provide a review related to structure, anti-coronavirus activity and molecular mechanism of natural substances and semisynthetic derivatives such as glycopeptides, lipopeptides, probiotics, surfactants, terpenes and resveratrol. We also include the latest in vitro experiments with anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. We also provide the theoretical basis for discussing the prospects of such natural molecules as possible alternative anti-Coronavirus products, so as to develop a complete screening for future applications. CONCLUSION: In summary, this review suggest to investigate deeper several molecules most of which belong to natural substances to fight COVID19 disease.","Fuochi, Virginia; Furneri, Pio Maria",Mini-reviews in medicinal chemistry (Online),,254

The study was carried out in Italy, one of the countries that has been most severely affected by the pandemic worldwide. The study was designed to include variables that might be specifically pertinent to the uniqueness of the restrictions imposed by the pandemic. Adults living in Italy (n = 1412) completed an online survey during the lockdown period in March 2020. Results showed two distinct digital interaction processes highlighted by the facilitating use of online emotions (""e-motions"") and online social support (""e-support""). In short, e-motions were positively related to posttraumatic growth, which in turn was positively associated with positive mental health and higher engagement in prosocial behaviors. Moreover, individuals who perceived themselves as having greater e-support were characterized by higher levels of positive mental health, which it turn was positively associated with prosocial behaviors. Collectively, these two digital interaction processes suggest that digital technologies appear to be critical resources in helping individuals cope with difficulties raised by the COVID-19 pandemic.","Canale, Natale; Marino, Claudia; Lenzi, Michela; Vieno, Alessio; Griffiths, Mark D; Gaboardi, Marta; Giraldo, Matteo; Cervone, Carmen; Massimo, Santinello",J Happiness Stud,,254

443508,In This Issue of,2020,"Necrotizing enterocolitis is the most common gastrointestinal disorder in premature neonates. This disease is characterized by massive epithelial necrosis, gut barrier dysfunction and improper mucosal defense development. Studies have shown that probiotic administration can decrease NEC incidence and mortality. The proposed mechanisms of probiotics for the prevention of NEC are: promotion of intestinal development; improved barrier function through decreased apoptosis and improved mucin production; decreased expression of proinflammatory cytokines IL6, IL8, and TNF&#945;, and modulation of microbiota dysbiosis in preterm infants. However, reported sepsis in the immunocompromised preterm host has deterred routine prophylactic administration of probiotics in the neonatal intensive care unit. We hypothesize that maternal administration of probiotics to pregnant mouse dams can recapitulate the beneficial effects observed in neonates fed with probiotics directly. We exposed pregnant mice to the probiotics and monitored the changes in the developing intestines of the offspring. Pregnant mice were fed daily with the probiotics Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium infantis (LB) from embryonic day15 to 2-week-old postnatally. Intraperitoneal administration of IL-1ß in the pups was used to model proinflammatory insults. Sera were collected at 2 weeks of age and evaluated for inflammatory cytokines by enzyme-linked-immunosorbent-assay and gut permeability by Fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran tracer assay. Ileal tissues were collected for the evaluation of apoptosis and proliferation of the intestinal epithelium; as well as mucin and tight junction integrity at mucosal surface by immunofluorescent staining. We find that maternal LB exposure facilitated intestinal epithelial cell differentiation, prevented loss of mucin and preserved the intestinal integrity and barrier function and decreased serum levels of IL-1ß, TNF-&#945; and IL-6 in the preweaned offsprings. in LB exposed pups. We demonstrate that maternal probiotic supplementation promotes gut maturation in developing offspring. This is potentially a safe alternative therapy to induce intestinal maturation and prevent prematurity-associated neonatal disorders.","Yu, Yueyue; Lu, Jing; Oliphant, Kaitlyn; Gupta, Nikhilesh; Claud, Katerina; Lu, Lei",PLoS One,,254

METHODS: We conducted an online survey to evaluate demographic variables, working conditions, family dynamics, and mental health variables in nurses working in healthcare settings, in Portugal, during the Covid-19 outbreak. RESULTS: Portuguese nurses presented higher depression, anxiety and stress levels, when compared to the Portuguese general population, during the outbreak. Overall, nurses who did not consider the quantity and quality of personal protective equipment as adequate presented significantly higher levels of depression, anxiety, and stress. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that nurses' mental health status seems to be particularly affected by the Covid-19 outbreak and that some modifiable elements might accentuate the impacts on their mental health.","Sampaio, Francisco; Sequeira, Carlos; Teixeira, Laetitia",J Occup Environ Med,,254

Methods: In April 2020, a total of 60 patients and 59 caregivers were administered by phone scales assessing patients' QoL (McGill QoL Questionnaire), general health status (EQ-5D-5L), and caregiver burden (Zarit Burden Interview). The administration was repeated one month after the end of lockdown measures, with the addition of a qualitative questionnaire (COVID-QoL Questionnaire) exploring family reorganization and personal perception of lock down. Results: QoL and perceived health status did not worsen during lockdown, while caregiver burden increased (p = 0.01). Patient's QoL and caregiver burden were inversely correlated at T1 (ZBI total score mildly correlated with Mc Gill existential subscore, p = 0.02, rho = 0.30 and with Mc Gill total score, p = 0.05, rho = 0.265). No significant correlations were found at T2. According to the COVID-QoL questionnaire, caregivers perceived lower family help compared to patients (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Restricted measures of lockdown period during COVID-19 pandemic did not result in a significant reduction of QoL in our cohort of ALS patients, while caregiver burden significantly increased. ALS motor impairment may have played a role in the unchanged life conditions of patients. Instead, the restriction of family help for primary caregivers could be responsible of their increased burden, reflecting the importance of a wide social support in the management of this clinical condition.","Giusiano, Silvia; Peotta, Laura; Iazzolino, Barbara; Mastro, Enza; Arcari, Martina; Palumbo, Francesca; Torrieri, Maria Claudia; Bombaci, Alessandro; Grassano, Maurizio; Cabras, Sara; Di Pede, Francesca; DeMattei, Filippo; Matteoni, Enrico; Solero, Luca; Daviddi, Margherita; Salamone, Paolina; Fuda, Giuseppe; Manera, Umberto; Canosa, Antonio; Chiò, Adriano; Calvo, Andrea; Moglia, Cristina; Vasta, Rosario",Amyotroph Lateral Scler Frontotemporal Degener,,254

Thus, its impacts on maternal health are not yet fully established. This study aimed to verify the relationship between the maternal mortality ratio and the incidence of COVID-19 in the State of Bahia, Brazil, 2020. METHODS: This time-series study used publicly available information in Brazil, to obtain data on maternal deaths and live births in Bahia, State, from January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2020. The time trend of Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) was analysed through polynomial regression, of order 6. Expected MMR, monthly (Jan-Dec) and annual values for 2020, were predicted by the additive Holt-Winters exponential smoothing algorithm, with 95% confidence interval, based on the time series of the MMR from 2011 to 2019, and the accuracy of the forecasts for 2020 was assessed by checking the smoothing coefficients and the mean errors. According to the statistical forecast, the MMR values âârecorded in the year 2020 were compared to those expected. RESULTS: In 2020, the annual MMR in Bahia, Brazil, was 78.23/100,000 live births, 59.46% higher than the expected ratio (49.06 [95% CI 38.70-59.90]). The increase in maternal mortality ratio relative to expected values was observed throughout the 2020 months; however, only after May, when the COVID-19 epidemic rose sharply, it exceeded the upper limit of the 95% CI of the monthly prediction. Of the 144 registered maternal deaths in 2020, 19 (13.19%) had COVID-19 mentioned as the cause of death. CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed the increase in maternal mortality, and its temporal relationship with the incidence of COVID-19, in Bahia, Brazil, in 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic may be directly and indirectly related to this increase, which needs to be investigated. An urgent public health action is needed to prevent and reduce maternal deaths during this pandemic, in Brazil.","de Carvalho-Sauer, Rita de Cássia Oliveira; Costa, Maria da Conceição N; Teixeira, Maria Gloria; do Nascimento, Estela Maria Ramos; Silva, Ediane Maria Filardi; Barbosa, Mariana Luiza Almeida; da Silva, Géssica Rodrigues; Santos, Thaissa Piedade; Paixao, Enny S",BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,,254

Inflammation is mainly managed using conventional medicines that are associated with many side effects. Plant-based remedies are considerably better alternative therapies for they have fewer side effects. Objective: This study aimed at determining the anti-inflammatory potential of dichloromethane (DCM) leaf extracts of Eucalyptus globulus and Senna didymobotrya in mice. Methods: Fresh leaves of these plants were harvested from Embu County, Kenya. Quantitative phytochemical analysis was done using Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). Anti-inflammatory test comprised nine groups of five animals each: normal, negative, positive controls and 6 experimental groups. Inflammation was induced with Carrageenan. One hour post-treatment, the different groups were intraperitoneally administered with the reference drug, diclofenac, 3% DMSO and six DCM leaf extracts at doses of 25, 50, 100, 150, 200 and 250mg/kgbw. Results: GC-MS results revealed &#945;-phellandrene, camphene, terpinolene, and limonene among others. Anti-inflammatory effects showed that extract doses of 100,150,200 and 250mg/kg bw significantly reduced the inflamed paw. Doses of 200 and 250mg/kgbw in both plants were more potent and compared with diclofenac. E. globulus extract dose of 250mg kg bw reduced inflamed paw in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th hours, by 2.27,6.52,9.09 and 10.90% respectively while S.didymobotrya at similar dose ranges, inflamed paw reduced by 2.41, 5.43, 8.31 and 9.05% respectively. Conclusion: E. globulus and S. didymobotrya have potent anti-inflammatory activities, attributed to their constituent phytochemicals. This study confirms the traditional use of these plants in treating inflammation.","Mworia, Joseph Kiambi; Kibiti, Cromwell Mwiti; Ngeranwa, Joseph Jn; Ngugi, Mathew Piero",Afr Health Sci,,254

453923,Role of birth companion in COVID-19: indispensable for her and an auxiliary hand for us,2020,"Although it is well established that cigarette smoking is associated with morbidity and mortality in several respiratory infections, data from recent studies suggest that active smokers are underrepresented among patients with COVID-19. This has led to claims that a 'smoker's paradox' may exist in COVID-19, wherein smokers are protected from infection and severe complications of COVID-19. We aimed to review and summarise existing literature in this context. Electronic databases were searched for articles that reported prevalence of smokers among patients with COVID-19 or studied any association of smoking with outcomes among patients with COVID-19. We identified several biases and knowledge gaps which may give the false impression that smoking is protective in COVID-19. As of now, the data supporting smoker's paradox claims are limited and questionable. Plausible biologic mechanisms by which smoking might be protective in COVID-19 include an anti-inflammatory effect of nicotine, a blunted immune response in smokers (reducing the risk of a cytokine storm in COVID-19) and increased nitric oxide in the respiratory tract (which may inhibit replication of SARS-CoV-2 and its entry into cells). On the other hand, smoking may worsen susceptibility and prognosis in COVID-19, in a manner similar to other respiratory infections. The claims of a protective effect must be viewed with extreme caution by both the general population as well as clinicians. Further investigations into the interaction between smoking and COVID-19 are warranted to accurately assess the risk of contracting COVID-19 among smokers, and progression to mechanical ventilation or death in patients suffering from it.","Usman, Muhammad Shariq; Siddiqi, Tariq Jamal; Khan, Muhammad Shahzeb; Patel, Urvish K; Shahid, Izza; Ahmed, Jawad; Kalra, Ankur; Michos, Erin D",BMJ Evid.

454036,Effect of Covid-19 quarantine on diabetes Care in Children,2021,"The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is primarily a respiratory pathogen and its clinical manifestations are dominated by respiratory symptoms, the most severe of which is acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, COVID-19 is increasingly recognized to cause an overwhelming inflammatory response and cytokine storm leading to end organ damage. End organ damage to heart is one of the most severe complications of COVID-19 that increases the risk of death. We proposed a two-fold mechanism responsible for causing acute coronary events in patients with COVID-19 infection: Cytokine storm leading to rapid onset formation of new coronary plaques along with destabilization of pre-existing plaques and direct myocardial injury secondary to acute systemic viral infection. A well-coordinated immune response is the first line innate immunity against a viral infection. However, an uncoordinated response and hypersecretion of cytokines and chemokines lead to immune related damage to the human body. Human Coronavirus (HCoV) infection causes infiltration of inflammatory cells that cause excessive production of cytokines, proteases, coagulation factors, oxygen radicals and vasoactive molecules causing endothelial damage, disruption of fibrous cap and initiation of formation of thrombus. Systemic viral infections also cause vasoconstriction leading to narrowing of vascular lumen and stimulation of platelet activation via shear stress. The resultant cytokine storm causes secretion of hypercoagulable tissue factor without consequential increase in counter-regulatory pathways such as AT-III, activated protein C and plasminogen activator type 1. Lastly, influx of CD4+ T-cells in cardiac vasculature results in an increased production of cytokines that stimulate smooth muscle cells to migrate into the intima and generate collagen and other fibrous products leading to advancement of fatty streaks to advanced atherosclerotic lesions. Direct myocardial damage and cytokine storm leading to destabilization of pre-existing plaques and accelerated formation of new plaques are the two instigating mechanisms for acute coronary syndromes in COVID-19.","Sheth, Aakash R; Grewal, Udhayvir S; Patel, Harsh P; Thakkar, Samarthkumar; Garikipati, Subhash; Gaddam, Jashwanth; Bawa, Danish",Med Hypotheses,,254

Due to the poverty rate in Africa, as well as poor access to quality health care, inadequate medical staff and poor technology, Africa has been predicted to be one of the most severely affected continents in the world by COVID-19. The objective of this study was to examine the survival rate of COVID-19 patients in Nigeria using the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) forecasting approach. The source of the data used for this study was the secondary data obtained from the daily publication/report of the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) from 28th February 2020 to 30th June 2020. The mean daily survival rate of COVID-19 patients was found to be 27.5% with a median survival rate of 25.4% which is below 50%. Also, the ARIMA (0, 1, 1) was identified to be appropriate for predicting the survival rate of COVID-19 patients in Nigeria within the observed period. Further findings showed that little variation exists between the predicted and actual survival rate of COVID19 for June 2020 which indicates that the obtained ARIMA model (0, 1, 1) was adequate for the estimation of the survival rate of COVID-19 in Nigeria. Based on the findings of the study, the need for the Nigerian government to explore effective treatment strategies both internationally and locally to improve the survival rate of patients with the disease was strongly recommended. Also, the need for the government to encourage local manufacturing of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) such as garment, which is expected to help health workers effectively manage affected persons without being infected at the front line was recommended.","Aronu, Charles Okechukwu; Ekwueme, Godspower Onyekachukwu; Sol-Akubude, Vincent Ikemefuna; Okafor, Patrick Nnaemeka",Sci Afr,,254

METHODS: Anonymous surveys were emailed to members of the Society of Gynecologic Oncology (SGO). The spread of COVID-19 and its impact on gynecologic oncology care in terms of alterations to normal treatment patterns and anticipated challenges were assessed. The Wilcoxon rank sum test was performed to determine risk factors for COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: We analyzed the responses of 331 gynecologic oncology providers. COVID-19 is present in 99.1% of surveyed communities with 99.7% reporting mitigation efforts in effect. The infection rate differs significantly between regions (pâª0.001) with the Northeast reporting the highest number of COVID-19 cases. Practice volume has dropped by 61.6% since the start of the pandemic with most cancellations being provider initiated. A majority of responders (52.8%) believed that ovarian cancer will be the most affected cancer by COVID-19. >94% of responders are proceeding with gynecologic cancer surgeries with exception of grade 1, endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma (36.3%). Surgical backlog (58.6%), delayed cancer diagnosis (43.2%) and re-establishing normal care with delayed patient (37.8%) were identified as the top 3 challenges after COVID-19 has abated. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 is widespread and has radically altered normal practice patterns. Despite COVID-19 related concerns, most gynecologic oncology care is proceeding. However, the steep decline in clinical volume shows there is a large group of patients who are not being diagnosed or are deferring care.","Nakayama, John; El-Nashar, Sherif A; Waggoner, Steven; Traughber, Bryan; Kesterson, Joshua",Gynecol Oncol,,254

464418,Daily inpatient ertapenem therapy can be an alternative to hospitalization for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"For 35 years, our laboratory has been involved in identifying psychosocial factors that predict who becomes ill when they are exposed to a virus affecting the upper respiratory tract. To pursue this question, we used a unique viral-challenge design in which we assessed behavioral, social, and psychological factors in healthy adults. We subsequently exposed these adults to a cold or influenza virus and then monitored them in quarantine for 5 to 6 days for onset of respiratory illness. Factors we found to be associated with greater risk of respiratory illnesses after virus exposure included smoking, ingesting an inadequate level of vitamin C, and chronic psychological stress. Those associated with decreased risk included social integration, social support, physical activity, adequate and efficient sleep, and moderate alcohol intake. We cautiously suggest that our findings could have implications for identifying who becomes ill when exposed to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This argument is based on evidence that the associations we report are replicable across multiple respiratory viruses and that the pathways found to link psychosocial factors to colds and influenza may play similar roles in COVID-19.","Cohen, Sheldon",Perspect Psychol Sci,,254

The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 is primarily due to person-to-person transmission. To understand the epidemiological traits of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, we conducted phylogenetic analysis on genome sequences from >54K SARS-CoV-2 cases obtained from two public databases. Hierarchical clustering analysis on geographic patterns in the resulting phylogenetic trees revealed a co-expansion tendency of the virus among neighboring countries with diverse sources and transmission routes for SARS-CoV-2. Pairwise sequence similarity analysis demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted locally and evolves during transmission. However, no significant differences were seen among SARS-CoV-2 genomes grouped by host age or sex. Here, our identified epidemiological traits provide information to better prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and to facilitate the development of effective vaccines and therapeutics against the virus.","Pan, Bohu; Ji, Zuowei; Sakkiah, Sugunadevi; Guo, Wenjing; Liu, Jie; Patterson, Tucker A; Hong, Huixiao",Viruses,,254

Both test lines bound to several classes of immunoglobulins (G, M, and A). Specific anti-SARS immunoglobulins were revealed by a colorimetric probe formed by N and gold nanoparticles. Targeting the total antibodies response to infection enabled achieving 100% diagnostic specificity (95.75-100, C.I. 95%, n = 85 healthy and with other infections individuals) and 94.6% sensitivity (84.9-98.9, C.I. 95%, n = 62 SARS CoV-2 infected subjects) as early as 7 days post confirmation of positivity. Agreeing results with a reference serological ELISA were achieved, except for the earlier detection capability of the rapid test. Follow up of the three seroconverting patients endorsed the hypothesis of the random rise of the different immunoglobulins and strengthened the 'total antibodies' approach for the trustworthy detection of serological response to SARS CoV-2 infection.","Cavalera, Simone; Colitti, Barbara; Rosati, Sergio; Ferrara, Gianmarco; Bertolotti, Luigi; Nogarol, Chiara; Guiotto, Cristina; Cagnazzo, Celeste; Denina, Marco; Fagioli, Franca; Di Nardo, Fabio; Chiarello, Matteo; Baggiani, Claudio; Anfossi, Laura",Talanta,,254

Besides traditional risk factors, dysregulation of lung immune defenses and microbiota may play an important role in ARDS patients. Prone positioning does not seem to be associated with a higher risk of pulmonary infection. Although bacteria associated with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) in ARDS patients are similar to those in patients without ARDS, atypical pathogens (Aspergillus, herpes simplex virus and cytomegalovirus) may also be responsible for infection in ARDS patients. Diagnosing pulmonary infection in ARDS patients is challenging, and requires a combination of clinical, biological and microbiological criteria. The role of modern tools (e.g., molecular methods, metagenomic sequencing, etc.) remains to be evaluated in this setting. One of the challenges of antimicrobial treatment is antibiotics diffusion into the lungs. Although targeted delivery of antibiotics using nebulization may be interesting, their place in ARDS patients remains to be explored. The use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in the most severe patients is associated with a high rate of infection and raises several challenges, diagnostic issues and pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics changes being at the top. Prevention of pulmonary infection is a key issue in ARDS patients, but there is no specific measure for these high-risk patients. Reinforcing preventive measures using bundles seems to be the best option.","Luyt, Charles-Edouard; Bouadma, Lila; Morris, Andrew Conway; Dhanani, Jayesh A; Kollef, Marin; Lipman, Jeffrey; Martin-Loeches, Ignacio; Nseir, Saad; Ranzani, Otavio T; Roquilly, Antoine; Schmidt, Matthieu; Torres, Antoni; Timsit, Jean-François",Intensive Care Med,,254

473244,The Challenges of COVID-19 for People Living With Diabetes: Considerations for Digital Health,2020,"One of the central goals in molecular evolutionary biology is to determine the sources of variation in the rate of sequence evolution among proteins. Gene expression level is widely accepted as the primary determinant of protein evolutionary rate, because it scales with the extent of selective constraints imposed on a protein, leading to the well-known negative correlation between expression level and protein evolutionary rate (the E-R anticorrelation). Selective constraints have been hypothesized to entail the maintenance of protein function, the avoidance of cytotoxicity caused by protein misfolding or nonspecific protein-protein interactions, or both. However, empirical tests evaluating the relative importance of these hypotheses remain scarce, likely due to the nontrivial difficulties in distinguishing the effect of a deleterious mutation on a protein's function versus its cytotoxicity. We realized that examining the sequence evolution of viral proteins could overcome this hurdle. It is because purifying selection against mutations in a viral protein that result in cytotoxicity per se is likely relaxed, whereas purifying selection against mutations that impair viral protein function persists. Multiple analyses of SARS-CoV-2 and nine other virus species revealed a complete absence of any E-R anticorrelation. As a control, the E-R anticorrelation does exist in human endogenous retroviruses where purifying selection against cytotoxicity is present. Taken together, these observations do not support the maintenance of protein function as the main constraint on protein sequence evolution in cellular organisms.","Wei, Changshuo; Chen, Yan-Ming; Chen, Ying; Qian, Wenfeng",Genome biol. evol,,254

Using mandatory large-scale public health interventions including a lockdown with locally varying intensity and duration, China has been successful in controlling the epidemic at an early stage. The epicentre of the pandemic has since shifted to Europe and The Americas. In certain cities and regions, health systems became overwhelmed by high numbers of cases and deaths, whereas other regions continue to experience low incidence rates. Still, lockdowns were usually implemented country-wide, albeit with differing intensities between countries. Compared to its neighbours, Germany has managed to keep the epidemic relatively well under control, in spite of a lockdown that was only partial. In analogy to many countries at a similar stage, Germany is now under increasing pressure to further relax lockdown measures to limit economic and psychosocial costs. However, if this is done too rapidly, Germany risks facing tens of thousands more severe cases of COVID-19 and deaths in the coming months. Hence, it could again follow China's example and relax measures according to local incidence, based on intensive testing.","Müller, Olaf; Lu, Guangyu; Jahn, Albrecht; Razum, Oliver",Int. j. health policy manag,,254

The Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP) is an endeavor to generate 3-dimensional (3D) molecular atlases of healthy and diseased kidney biopsies using multiple state-of-the-art OMICS and imaging technologies across several institutions. Obtaining rigorous and reproducible results from disparate methods and at different sites to interrogate biomolecules at a single cell level or in 3D space is a significant challenge that can be a futile exercise if not well controlled. We describe a ""follow the tissue"" pipeline for generating a reliable and authentic single cell/region 3D molecular atlas of human adult kidney. Our approach emphasizes quality assurance, quality control, validation and harmonization across different OMICS and imaging technologies from sample procurement, processing, storage, shipping to data generation, analysis and sharing. We established benchmarks for quality control, rigor, reproducibility and feasibility across multiple technologies through a pilot experiment using common source tissue that was processed and analyzed at different institutions and different technologies. A peer review system was established to critically review quality control measures and the reproducibility of data generated by each technology before being approved to interrogate clinical biopsy specimens. The process established economizes the use of valuable biopsy tissue for multi-OMICS and imaging analysis with stringent quality control to ensure rigor and reproducibility of results and serves as a model for precision medicine projects across laboratories, institutions and consortia.","El-Achkar, Tarek M; Eadon, Michael T; Menon, Rajasree; Lake, Blue B; Sigdel, Tara K; Alexandrov, Theodore; Parikh, Samir; Zhang, Guanshi; Dobib, Dejan; Dunn, Kenneth W; Otto, Edgar A; Anderton, Christopher R; Carson, Jonas M; Luo, Jinghui; Park, Chris; Hamidi, Habib; Zhou, Jian; Hoover, Paul; Schroeder, Andrew; Joanes, Marianinha; Azeloglu, Evren U; Sealfon, Rachel; Winfree, Seth; Steck, Becky; He, Yongqun; D039,; Agati, Vivette Denise; Iyengar, Ravi; Troyanskaya, Olga G; Barisoni, Laura; Gaut, Joseph; Zhang, Kun; Laszik, Zoltan; Rovin, Brad; Dagher, Pierre C; Sharma, Kumar; Sarwal, Minnie; Hodgin, Jeffrey B; Alpers, Charles E; Kretzer, Matthias; Jain, Sanjay; The Kidney Precision Medicine Project, For",Physiol. genomics,,254

The clinical spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 infection ranges from asymptomatic infection to critical illness affecting almost every organ including the central and peripheral nervous systems. Myoclonus, a less expected and relatively unusual neurological complication, together with ataxia, has lately been associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. We describe the case of a 67-year-old male patient, admitted to our hospital for interstitial bilateral pneumonia due to SARS-CoV-2 infection, who progressively developed general myoclonus and later cerebellar ataxia and gait disturbance. Given the timeline from COVID-19 systemic symptoms to neurological manifestations and the normal results of extensive and non-conclusive diagnostic work-up (blood test, lumbar puncture, EEG, cerebral MRI), a para-infectious encephalopathy related to SARS-CoV-2 was contemplated and a high dose of methylprednisolone was started with prompt symptom improvement. Further investigation and neuroepidemiological studies are needed to help define the mechanism of neuroinvasion and the entire spectrum of neurological manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection, even in mildly affected patients, in terms of prevention, treatment and possible neurological sequelae. LEARNING POINTS: SARS-CoV-2 infection can be related to neurological symptoms and sequelae.Myoclonus, specifically when associated with ataxia, might represent the expression of COVID-19-related encephalopathy.Myoclonus associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection mostly responds to treatment with steroids.","Giannantoni, N.

Therefore the governments have to adopt fast containment measures in order to stop its spread and to prevent the related devastating consequences. In this paper, a technique is proposed to optimally design the lock-down and reopening policies so as to minimize an aggregate cost function accounting for the number of individuals that decease due to the spread of COVID-19. A constraint on the maximal number of concomitant infected patients is also taken into account in order to prevent the collapse of the health system. The optimal procedure is built on the basis of a simple SIR model that describes the outbreak of a generic disease, without attempting to accurately reproduce all the COVID-19 epidemic features. This modeling choice is motivated by the fact that the containing measurements are actuated during the very first period of the outbreak, when the characteristics of the new emergent disease are not known but timely containment actions are required. In fact, as a consequence of dealing with poor preliminary data, the simplest modeling choice is able to reduce unidentifiability problems. Further, the relative simplicity of this model allows to compute explicitly its solutions and to derive closed-form expressions for the maximum number of infected and for the steady-state value of deceased individuals. These expressions can be then used to design static optimization problems so to determine the (open-loop) optimal lock-down and reopening policies for early-stage epidemics accounting for both the health and economic costs.","Borri, Alessandro; Palumbo, Pasquale; Papa, Federico; Possieri, Corrado",Annual reviews in control,,254

Considering the cost-effectiveness of the imaging used, ultrasound is a non-ionizing, portable and bedside imaging modality with a high diagnostic impact in emergencies and intensive care units in pandemics, but it is operator dependent. In our article, we provide a comprehensive review of the role of point-of-care ultrasound in the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection and its impact on the lungs, cardiovascular system, eyes and abdominal organs. Moreover, ultrasound can provide real-time diagnostic and therapeutic interventions, such as the placement of a central catheter and aspiration of pericardial effusion. Awareness of health care professionals in the front-line fighting COVID-19 infection in emergency rooms, clinics, and in intensive care units is important and will help rapid and targeted management decisions.","Galluccio, Felice; Ergonenc, Tolga; Yamak Altinpulluk, Ece; Perez Herrero, Maria; De la Torre Carpente, Maria Del Mar; Capassoni, Marco; Espinoza, Karla; Aragon Benedi, Cristian; El-Sayed, Abdallah Allam; Orzalesi, Vanni; Fajardo Perez, Mario",Med Ultrason,,254
485371,Covid-19: UK budget gives £94 a week statutory sick pay to self-isolators and their carers,2020,"The bone encasing the inner ear, known as the otic capsule, is unique because it remodels little postnatally compared to other bones in the body. Previous studies established that osteoprotegerin (OPG) in the inner ear inhibits otic capsule remodeling. OPG acts as a decoy receptor of receptor activator of nuclear factor &#954;B ligand (RANKL) to disrupt the interaction between RANKL and RANK, the primary regulators of bone metabolism. Here we studied the expression and function of RANK and RANKL in the murine cochlea. Using a combination of in situ hybridization, real-time quantitative RT-PCR, and western blot, we demonstrate that Rankl and Rank genes and their protein products are expressed in the intracochlear soft tissues and the otic capsule in a developmentally regulated manner. Using a culture of neonatal murine cochlear neurons, we show that the interaction between RANK and RANKL inhibits neurite outgrowth in these neurons, and is associated with upregulation of Nogo-A expression. Taken together, our results suggest that, in addition to regulating otic capsule bone remodeling, RANK and RANKL expressed by intracochlear soft tissues may also regulate spiral ganglion neuron function by affecting neurite outgrowth.","Kao, Shyan-Yuan; Katsumi, Sachiyo; Han, Dongjun; Bizaki-Vallaskangas, Argyro J; Vasilijic, Sasa; Landegger, Lukas D; Kristiansen, Arthur G; McKenna, Michael J; Stankovic, Konstantina M",Bone,,254

Currently, mounting evidence has shown the occurrence of neurological symptoms in patients with COVID-19. However, the detailed mechanism by which the SARS-CoV-2 attacks the brain is not well characterized. Recent investigations have revealed that a cytokine storm contributes to brain inflammation and subsequently triggers neurological manifestations during the COVID-19 outbreak. Targeting brain inflammation may provide significant clues to the treatment of neurologic complications caused by SARS-CoV-2. Vascular growth factor (VEGF), which is widely distributed in the brain, probably plays a crucial role in brain inflammation via facilitating the recruitment of inflammatory cells and regulating the level of angiopoietins II (Ang II). Also, Ang II is considered as the products of SARS-CoV-2-attacking target, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Further investigation of the therapeutic potential and the underlying mechanisms of VEGF-targeted drugs on the neurological signs of COVID-19 are warranted. In any case, VEGF is deemed a promising therapeutic target in suppressing inflammation during SARS-CoV-2 infection with neurological symptoms.","Yin, Xi-Xi; Zheng, Xiang-Rong; Peng, Wang; Wu, Mao-Lan; Mao, Xiao-Yuan",ACS Chem Neurosci,,254

490406,The prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder related symptoms in Coronavirus outbreaks: A systematic-review and meta-analysis,2021,"High prevalence of vitamin D (VD) deficiency in COVID-19 patients was reported by several studies. Since VD is a key regulating factor of both innate and adaptive immunity, it was hypothesized that VD deficiency may predispose to SARS-CoV-2 infection and lower levels of VD could be related to increased COVID-19 severity and worse outcome risks. However, to date, only few studies partially investigated the relationship between VD and inflammatory and immune response and clinical features of COVID-19 patients. The aim of this study is to evaluate the influence of vitamin D levels on COVID-19 inflammatory activity, clinical pattern and disease severity. Patients admitted to San Raffaele University Hospital for COVID-19 from February 2020 were enrolled in this study. We excluded patients with comorbidities and therapies influencing VD metabolism. 25OH-Vitamin D levels were evaluated at admission in hospital and VD insufficiency and deficiency were defined as VD level below 30 ng/mL and 20 ng/mL, respectively. A total of 88 patients were included in the study. Median (IQR) VD levels were 16.3 (11.2–23.9) ng/mL. VD insufficiency and deficiency were found in 88.6% and in 68.2% of patients, respectively. Linear regression analyses showed a positive correlation between VD levels and PaO2/FiO2 ratio (p=0.019;r=0.254), and negative correlations between VD levels and Neutrophil/Lymphocyte (N/L) ratio (p=0.04;r=-0.19), C-reactive protein (CRP) levels (p=0.047;r=-0.18) and Interleukin 6 (IL-6) levels (p=0.04;r=-0.22). Lower VD levels were found in patients affected by severe disease (needs for high-flow oxygen therapy and/or noninvasive mechanical ventilation, admitted to ICU and/or dead) than non-severe patients (13.4 ng/mL [10.37–19.15] vs 18.45 ng/mL [15.15–24.95];p=0.007). Moreover, patients with VD deficiency had higher levels of CRP, LDH, IL-6, IFN-gamma (p=0.04, p=0.01, p=0.002, p=0.04;respectively), lower PaO2/FiO2 and higher N/L ratios (p=0.008, p=0.004;respectively), and higher rate of severe disease (65% vs 39%, p=0.02), as compared to VD non-deficient ones. In conclusion, low VD levels are widely found in hospitalized COVID-19 and may lead to increased disease severity through an excessive immune-inflammatory response. Our data suggest that reaching adequate vitamin D levels in risky population may contribute to prevention of COVID-19 occurrence and severity.","Filippo, Luigi di Allora Agnese Doga Mauro Querini Patrizia Rovere Locatelli Massimo Frara Stefano Giustina Andrea",Journal of the Endocrine Society,,254

Treatment in this subpopulation is complex due to the potential hepatotoxicity of some of the medicinal products used. Moreover, the pandemic has also negatively impacted patients with liver disease who have not contracted COVID-19, since the reallocation of human and material resources to the care of patients with the virus has resulted in a decrease in the treatment, diagnosis and follow-up of patients with liver disease, which will surely have negative consequences in the near future.

BACKGROUND: Care homes provide long-term care to vulnerable, frail older people, as well as to young people with profound disabilities. The COVID-19 pandemic has shown that the residential care sector has been seriously affected in many parts of the world and has exposed major flaws and vulnerabilities in infection control and other processes that have resulted in considerable loss of life of residents of these facilities. DESIGN: Discursive paper informed by a systematic literature. Review was carried out in line with PRISMA reporting guidelines. The review protocol was registered with PROSPERO on 2020 [CRD42020211847]. RESULTS: The review identified six papers meeting inclusion criteria across care residential facilities in different countries. Several prevention and mitigation strategies were identified to manage and reduce the spread and severity of viral respiratory infection pandemics. These strategies include isolation, restriction of movement, personal protective and hygienic measures, health education and information sharing, monitoring and coordination, and screening and treatment. Preparedness strategies identified were contingency planning such as reporting/communication, leadership, human resource, insurance, occupational health and resource availability. The prevention/mitigation and preparedness strategies helped to achieve decline in disease severity, reduced prevalence, reduced spread of the disease, improved readiness criteria, resource usefulness and increased intervention acceptability. This paper presents a conceptual framework exploring the interconnectedness of preparedness and prevention/ mitigation strategies and associated outcomes. We discuss areas of concern in the context of workforce employment patterns in the sector. Concerns related to the unintended consequences of strategies placed on aged care facilities, which may worsen mental health outcomes for residents, are discussed. CONCLUSIONS: Persons in residential care settings are at greater risk of infection during a pandemic, and therefore, strict measures to protect their safety are warranted. However, they are also a group who already experience social isolation and so any measures involving restrictions to visiting and social interaction, particularly over the longer term, must be accompanied by strategies to mitigate potential loneliness and mental health sequelae arising from long-term pandemic restrictions. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Though there was evidence of activity in preparedness for disasters within the residential care sector, various contextual factors affecting the sector were clearly not adequately considered or addressed in pre-pandemic disaster planning, particularly in the areas of staff movements between care homes and the length of time that social isolation and restriction measures would need to be in place. Future pandemic planning should consider the nature of the workforce model in the care home sector, and factor in strategies to better support the mobile and highly casualised workforce.","Usher, Kim; Durkin, Joanne; Gyamfi, Naomi; Warsini, Sri; Jackson, Debra",J. clin. nurs,,254

OBJECTIVE: We investigated the determinants of quality of life (QOL) in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Impacts of lifestyle changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic on 100 patients with PD and their caregivers/spouses were assessed. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale was used to assess anxiety and depression. The physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS) scores of the short form (SF)-8 were used to evaluate health-related QOL. RESULTS: Regarding health-related QOL, physical function, role physical, general health, vitality and the PCS score were significantly worse in PD patients than in caregivers. Worsening of PD-related symptoms, increased stress, and decreased physical activity were observed in 29.0%, 37.0% and 44.0% of PD patients, respectively. Sixteen patients (16.0%) experienced problems with hospital access, but none reported medication shortages. Strong concerns about COVID-19 were reported by 47.0% of caregivers and 50.0% of PD patients. In PD patients, increased gait disturbance and rigidity, disease severity, smoking, the levodopa equivalent dose and decreased body weight predicted a worse PCS score; anxiety, depression, female sex, stress and long disease duration predicted a worse MCS score. In caregivers, age and smoking contributed to a worse PCS score; depression, stress and worsening patient mood contributed to a worse MCS score.

In hospitals, it has been confirmed by several studies that SARS-CoV-2 can contaminate surfaces and medical equipment especially in hospitals dedicated to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. The aim of this study was to detect the contamination of hands, objects, and surfaces in isolation rooms and also in outpatients' clinics in hospitals and polyclinics. Environmental contamination of public high-touch surfaces in public facilities was also investigated during an active COVID-19 pandemic. Random swabs were also taken from public shops, pharmacies, bakeries, groceries, banknotes, and automated teller machines (ATMs). Samples were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 positivity using real-time polymerase chain reaction. In the COVID-19 regional reference hospital, only 3 out of 20 samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Hand swabs from SARS-CoV-2-positive patients in isolation rooms were occasionally positive for viral RNA. In outpatients' clinics, door handles were the most contaminated surfaces. Dental chairs, sinks, keyboards, ophthalmoscopes, and laboratory equipment were also contaminated. Although no positive swabs were found in shops and public facilities, random ATM swabs returned a positive result for SARS-CoV-2. Although there is no longer a focus on COVID-19 wards and isolation hospitals, more attention is required to decontaminate frequently touched surfaces in health-care facilities used by patients not diagnosed with COVID-19.

497632,How artificial intelligence and internet of things can aid in the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines,2021,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: The development of COVID-19 vaccines has progressed with encouraging safety and efficacy data. Concerns have been raised about SARS-CoV-2 vaccine responses in the large population of patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The study aimed to explore the safety and immunogenicity of COVID-19 vaccination in NAFLD. METHODS: This multicenter study included patients with NAFLD without a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection. All patients were vaccinated with 2 doses of inactivated vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. The primary safety outcome was the incidence of adverse reactions within 7 days after each injection and overall incidence of adverse reactions within 28 days, and the primary immunogenicity outcome was neutralizing antibody response at least 14 days after the whole-course vaccination. RESULTS: A total of 381 patients with pre-existing NAFLD were included from 11 designated centers in China. The median age was 39.0 years (IQR 33.0-48.0 years) and 179 (47.0%) were male. The median BMI was 26.1 kg/m2 (IQR 23.8-28.1 kg/m2). The number of adverse reactions within 7 days after each injection and adverse reactions within 28 days totaled 95 (24.9%) and 112 (29.4%), respectively. The most common adverse reactions were injection site pain in 70 (18.4%), followed by muscle pain in 21 (5.5%), and headache in 20 (5.2%). All adverse reactions were mild and self-limiting, and no grade 3 adverse reactions were recorded. Notably, neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detected in 364 (95.5%) patients with NAFLD. The median neutralizing antibody titer was 32 (IQR 8-64), and the neutralizing antibody titers were maintained. CONCLUSIONS: The inactivated COVID-19 vaccine appears to be safe with good immunogenicity in patients with NAFLD. LAY SUMMARY: The development of vaccines against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has progressed rapidly, with encouraging safety and efficacy data. This study now shows that the inactivated COVID-19 vaccine appears to be safe with good immunogenicity in the large population of patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.","Wang, Jitao; Hou, Zhiyun; Liu, Jianxin; Gu, Ye; Wu, Yunhong; Chen, Zhenhuai; Ji, Jiansong; Diao, Shiqi; Qiu, Yuanwang; Zou, Shengqiang; Zhang, Aiguo; Zhang, Nina; Wang, Fengxian; Li, Xue; Wang, Yan; Liu, Xing; Lv, Cheng; Chen, Shubo; Liu, Dengxiang; Ji, Xiaolin; Liu, Chao; Ren, Tao; Sun, Jingwei; Zhao, Zhongwei; Wu, Fazong; Li, Fenxiang; Wang, Ruixu; Yan, Yan; Zhang, Shiliang; Ge, Guohong; Shao, Jiangbo; Yang, Shiying; Liu, Chuan; Huang, Yifei; Xu, Dan; Li, Xiaoguo; Ai, Jingwen; He, Qing; Zheng, Ming-Hua; Zhang, Liting; Xie, Qing; Rockey, Don C; Fallowfield, Jonathan A; Zhang, Wenhong; Qi, Xiaolong",J Hepatol,,254

If one family member is exposed to the virus they could serve as a source of transmission or, if they fall ill, the resources they provide to others could be severed. These risks may be especially heightened for family members who work outside the home and provide care, or for those family members who care for multiple generations. Policies have the potential to help families bear the burden of these decisions.

498623,"Clinical Outcomes among Asymptomatic or Mildly Symptomatic COVID-19 Patients in an Isolation Facility in Chennai, India",2020,"The shortage of annotated medical images is one of the biggest challenges in the field of medical image computing. Without a sufficient number of training samples, deep learning based models are very likely to suffer from over-fitting problem. The common solution is image manipulation such as image rotation, cropping, or resizing. Those methods can help relieve the over-fitting problem as more training samples are introduced. However, they do not really introduce new images with additional information and may lead to data leakage as the test set may contain similar samples which appear in the training set. To address this challenge, we propose to generate diverse images with generative adversarial network. In this paper, we develop a novel generative method named generative adversarial U-Net , which utilizes both generative adversarial network and U-Net. Different from existing approaches, our newly designed model is domain-free and generalizable to various medical images. Extensive experiments are conducted over eight diverse datasets including computed tomography (CT) scan, pathology, X-ray, etc. The visualization and quantitative results demonstrate the efficacy and good generalization of the proposed method on generating a wide array of high-quality medical images.","Chen, Xiaocong; Li, Yun; Yao, Lina; Adeli, Ehsan; Zhang, Yu",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.04793v1.pdf,254

In early April 2020, a teaching hospital underwent shutdown and quarantine due to an outbreak of infection in accordance with Section 6 of the Infection Protection Act (index patient and 5 infected nursing staff). The complete staff (physicians, nurses and nonmedical personnel [NMP]) underwent COVID-19 testing within two phases: (1) between Apr 3rd and 5th, 2020 [n=1170], followed by (2) between Apr 8th and 9th, 2020 [n=953] with COVID-19 silent carrier positivity rates in accordance to testing phases of (1) n=19 (1.6%) and (2) n=25 (2.6%). The cumulative infection rate for NMP (1.6%), doctors (3.8%) and nurses (9.7%) was connected to type and extent of COVID-19 patient contact. Despite COVID-19 positivity of 34.8% (46 of 132 beds), a risk-free management of hospital operation is possible to a certain extent if hygiene regulations and strict patient selection are followed. However, a COVID-19-free clinic cannot be expected due to silent carriers.","von Freyburg, Alexander; Hagedorn, Hjalmar; Brücher, Björn; Schmidt, Annette; Scherer, Michael A",MMW Fortschr Med,,254
500947,Special Coverage on COVID-19: No One is Ready for This,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To document the level of physical function in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) recovering from acute respiratory failure and investigate which patient clinical characteristics could predict physical function assessed by the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) test. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Subacute unit of a Rehabilitation Institute. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with COVID-19 (N=184; aged 18 years or older) who were admitted to a subacute unit to stabilize their condition and recover from acute respiratory failure due to COVID-19. INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: At admission patients underwent the SPPB test, represented by the sum of 3 functional tests, standing balance, 4-meter gait speed, and 5-repetition sit-to-stand motion. Comparisons between 2 SPPB score groups were performed by an unpaired t test; multivariate stepwise linear regression analysis was employed to detect predictors of the SPPB score considering several clinical parameters. RESULTS: Participants were 74±12 years old, 52% were men and with more than 2 comorbidities in 43% of cases. SPPB score was 3.02±3.87 denoting patients' profound physical dysfunction. Normal physical function was detected in only 12% of patients, whereas low, intermediate, and severe impairment was found in 65%, 13%, and 10%, respectively. Age, both invasive and noninvasive ventilation use, and the presence of previous disability were significant predictors of SPPB. Patients without any comorbidities (8%) also exhibited low function (SPPB: 5.67±1.12). CONCLUSIONS: The majority of survivors after COVID-19 experienced acute respiratory failure due to pneumonia and exhibited substantial physical dysfunction influenced by age, mechanical ventilation need, and previous disability. Further studies are needed to evaluate the role of rehabilitation to promote recovery and community reintegration in this population.","Paneroni, Mara; Vogiatzis, Ioannis; Bertacchini, Laura; Simonelli, Carla; Vitacca, Michele",Arch. phys. med. rehabil,,254

The results of our survey suggest that there were no longer morning or evening usage peaks on weekdays, and a significant portion of respondents are experiencing higher or much higher electricity use than average. Most residents' perception of climate change issues during COVID-19 remained unchanged. Attitude, perceived behavioral control, and social norms are overall the strongest predictors of adoption intention and WTP for HEMS. Regarding WTP for specific well-being features, attitude was the strongest positive predictor of telemedical and home security features, and social norms are the strongest positive predictor of elderly assistance and job search. Technology anxiety, surprisingly, positively influences WTP for the well-being features. Trust in utilities is not related to adoption intention, but is positively associated with WTP for the well-being features. Although cybersecurity concerns are positively associated with HEMS adoption intention for energy and well-being features, this relationship is not significant in WTP. Residents who had moderate perceived risk of getting COVID-19 are willing to pay more than the high- and low-risk groups. This paper addresses the interactions among technology attributes -, and users’ social-psychological and demographics factors. Additionally, this study provides insights for further research in examining technology adoption and energy dynamics during times of crises, such as the COVID-19.","Chen, Chien-fei; Zarazua de Rubens, Gerardo; Xu, Xiaojing; Li, Jiayi",Energy Res.

We recruited 205 patients with schizophrenia and 221 healthy controls in this study. The participants were administered a subjective-report scale on memory (the Prospective and Retrospective Memory Questionnaire), and several objective memory tasks measuring verbal memory, visual memory, and working memory. Clinical insight was measured with an item in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. We found that when patients with schizophrenia were divided into subgroups with good and poor insight, both subgroups showed impairment in memory performance compared with controls. The schizophrenia patients with good insight reported similar memory complaints as controls whereas patients with poor insight reported less memory complaints than did the controls. These findings suggest that clinical insight may be related to subjective memory complaints, but not objective memory performance.","Ye, Jun-Yan; Yang, Tian-Xiao; Lui, Simon S Y; Cui, Ji-Fang; Qin, Xiao-Jing; Jia, Lu-Xia; Cheung, Eric F C; Gan, Ming-Yuan; Tan, Shu-Ping; Wang, Ya; Chan, Raymond C K",PsyCh journal (Online),,254

OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine the association between CRD (including disease overlap) and the clinical outcomes of COVID-19. METHODS: Data of diagnoses, comorbidities, medications, laboratory results, and clinical outcomes were extracted from the national COVID-19 reporting system. CRD was diagnosed based on International Classification of Diseases-10 codes. The primary endpoint was the composite outcome of needing invasive ventilation, admission to intensive care unit, or death within 30 days after hospitalization. The secondary endpoint was death within 30 days after hospitalization. RESULTS: We included 39,420 laboratory-confirmed patients from the electronic medical records as of May 6, 2020. Any CRD and CRD overlap was present in 2.8% and 0.2% of patients, respectively. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was most common (56.6%), followed by bronchiectasis (27.9%) and asthma (21.7%). COPD-bronchiectasis overlap was the most common combination (50.7%), followed by COPD-asthma (36.2%) and asthma-bronchiectasis overlap (15.9%). After adjustment for age, sex, and other systemic comorbidities, patients with COPD (odds ratio [OR]: 1.71, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.44-2.03) and asthma (OR: 1.45, 95% CI: 1.05-1.98), but not bronchiectasis, were more likely to reach to the composite endpoint compared with those without at day 30 after hospitalization. Patients with CRD were not associated with a greater likelihood of dying from COVID-19 compared with those without. Patients with CRD overlap did not have a greater risk of reaching the composite endpoint compared with those without. CONCLUSION: CRD was associated with the risk of reaching the composite endpoint, but not death, of COVID-19.","Guan, Wei-Jie; Liang, Wen-Hua; Shi, Ying; Gan, Lan-Xia; Wang, Hai-Bo; He, Jian-Xing; Zhong, Nan-Shan",J Allergy Clin Immunol Pract,,254

COVID-19 patients may have different degrees of coagulopathy, but the mechanism is not yet clear. We aimed to analyse the relationship between coagulation dysfunction and liver damage in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 74 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the First People's Hospital of Yueyang from 1 January to 30 March 2020 was carried out. According to the coagulation function, 27 cases entered the coagulopathy group and 47 cases entered the control group. A case control study was conducted to analyse the correlation between the occurrence of coagulation dysfunction and liver damage in COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), markers of liver damage, were positively correlated with coagulopathy (p = 0.039, OR 2.960, 95% CI 1.055-8.304; and p = 0.028, OR 3.352, 95% CI 1.137-9.187). Alkaline phosphatase (ALP), Î³-glutamyl transpeptidase (Î³-GT), and total bilirubin (TBIL) were not statistically correlated with coagulopathy. According to the diagnosis and treatment plan, the included cases were classified into mild, moderate, severe, and critical. The results showed that the occurrence of coagulation dysfunction had no statistical correlation with the severity of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Coagulation dysfunction in patients with COVID-19 is closely related to liver damage. A longer course of the disease may cause a vicious circle of coagulopathy and liver damage. Clinicians need to closely monitor coagulation and liver function tests and to give prophylactic or supportive therapy when needed.","Chen, Sai; Liu, Hanting; Li, Tie; Huang, Rong; Gui, Rong; Zhang, Junhua",Ups J Med Sci,,254

In the current study, we sought to determine the estimated time to recovery for vascular surgery procedures delayed due to COVID-19 in a regional health system METHODS: Utilizing data from a 35-hospital regional vascular surgical collaborative consisting of all hospitals performing vascular surgery in the state of Michigan, a 35-hospital regional health collaborative consisting of all hospitals completing vascular surgery procedures within the state of Michigan, we estimated delayed surgical cases for adults undergoing carotid endarterectomy, carotid stenting, endovascular and open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, and lower extremity bypass. We utilized Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models to predict surgical volume in the absence of the COVID-19 pandemic and utilized historical data to predict elective surgical recovery time. RESULTS: Median statewide monthly vascular surgical volume for the study period was 439 procedures, with a maximum statewide monthly case volume of 519 procedures. For the month of April 2020, elective vascular surgery procedural volume decreased by approximately 90%. Significant variability was seen in estimated hospital capacity as well as estimated backlogged cases, with the recovery of elective cases estimated to take approximately 8 months. If hospitals across the collaborative share the burden of backlogged cases, the recovery could be shortened to approximately 3 months. CONCLUSION: In this study of vascular surgical volume in a regional health collaborative, elective surgical procedures decreased by 90% resulting in a backlog of over 700 cases.

Impacts on the mental health conditions and the associated predictors relating to adults in Pakistan, the fifth most populous country in the world, during the COVID-19 remain understudied. Our aim was to investigate distress, anxiety, and overall mental health and their associated predictors among Pakistani adults in this pandemic. We specifically examine mental health issues based on the distance from the epicenter, (a predictor that has revealed opposing evidence in other countries) based on the theories of typhoon eye effect and ripple effect. The sample consisted of 601 adults who were surveyed online about 2.5 months into the outbreak across Pakistan with varying distances from the epicenter of COVID-19 of Karachi. RESULTS: The results showed that 9.2 and 19.0% of the participants surpassed the cut-off criteria for distress and anxiety disorders, respectively. Overall, the distance from the epicenter positively predicted the mental health of adults in Pakistan, and family size negatively moderated this effect. The distance from the epicenter negatively predicted distress and anxiety disorders for adults in large families, which are quite common in Pakistan. CONCLUSION: The evidence of the study interestingly finds that the prediction of the mental health of people by their distance from the epicenter depends on family size. The evidence of this study can help to provide initial indicators for mental health care providers to screen vulnerable groups in Pakistan, a populous country that continues struggling to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic.","Lateef, Tooba; Chen, Jiyao; Tahir, Muhammad; Lateef, Teba Abdul; Chen, Bryan Z; Li, Jizhen; Zhang, Stephen X",Global Health,,254

515355,Clinical Features of Emergency Department Patients from Early COVID-19 Pandemic that Predict SARS-CoV-2 Infection: Machine-learning Approach,2021,"Eugen Bleuler, the founder of the concept of schizophrenia, pointed out that psychotic patients were able to live in two disjoint worlds (namely, the social, intersubjective world and the delusional world). He termed this phenomenon ""double bookkeeping,"" but did not provide any conceptual elaboration of this phenomenon or its possible mechanisms. Double bookkeeping has been neglected in mainstream psychiatry, but it has been addressed in recent theoretical work, however mainly concerned with the issue of delusion. In this article, we present clinical material that supports the view that double bookkeeping manifests itself across various psychotic phenomena and its antecedent may be observed in premorbid (pre-onset) phases as well as in the schizotypal disorder. We try to conceptualize double bookkeeping to concretize an often atmospheric perception of paradoxicality in the encounter with the patient. A phenomenological analysis of double bookkeeping suggests an instability in the affective (""auto-affection"") articulation of selfhood. We point to four main implications of our presentation: (1) diagnostic, (2) epistemological, (3) therapeutic and (4) pathogenetic research.","Parnas, Josef; Urfer-Parnas, Annick; Stephensen, Helene",Eur. arch. psychiatr. clin. neurosci,,254

Based on a study of 1,051,032 23andMe research participants, we report genetic and nongenetic associations with testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, respiratory symptoms and hospitalization. Using trans-ancestry genome-wide association studies, we identified a strong association between blood type and COVID-19 diagnosis, as well as a gene-rich locus on chromosome 3p21.31 that is more strongly associated with outcome severity. Hospitalization risk factors include advancing age, male sex, obesity, lower socioeconomic status, non-European ancestry and preexisting cardiometabolic conditions. While non-European ancestry was a significant risk factor for hospitalization after adjusting for sociodemographics and preexisting health conditions, we did not find evidence that these two primary genetic associations explain risk differences between populations for severe COVID-19 outcomes.","Shelton, Janie F; Shastri, Anjali J; Ye, Chelsea; Weldon, Catherine H; Filshtein-Sonmez, Teresa; Coker, Daniella; Symons, Antony; Esparza-Gordillo, Jorge; Aslibekyan, Stella; Auton, Adam",Nat Genet,,254
516107,The emergency department in the COVID-19 era. Who are we missing?,2020,"Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investing is becoming mainstream, and the COVID-19 pandemic has amplified the momentum. The interest in ESG investing creates greater demand for ESG data, ratings, and rankings, spawning a proliferation of agencies offering these products, which investors, academics, and regulators rely on unquestioningly. Research highlights that different ESG ratings and rankings produce significantly different assessments of the ESG performance of companies. This article examines the causes of differences in the ratings and rankings generated by different agencies. Findings indicate that the divergences among raters can be attributed to differences in the definitions of ESG constructs (i.e., a theorization problem) and methodological differences (i.e., a commensurability problem). While users of ESG ratings and rankings are advised to study the definitions and methodologies before their use, a lack of transparency about the data sources, weightings, and methodologies makes it difficult to ensure that companies’ true ESG performance is accounted for when making portfolio selection and investment decisions. As a solution, the article notes that instead of attempting to compare and contrast ratings and rankings of different agencies, investors should determine the ESG constructs that are material to their own investment strategies and then match them with an ESG rating or ranking product that closely resembles those constructs. TOPICS: ESG investing, information providers/credit ratings, portfolio construction, portfolio theory Key Findings ▪ There are significant divergences among the ratings and rankings provided by different ESG rating agencies. ▪ Differences among various ESG ratings and rankings are caused by differences in the definitions of ESG constructs (i.e., a theorization problem) and differences in the methods applied for measuring ESG performance of companies (i.e., a commensurability problem). ▪ Agencies providing ESG ratings and rankings are not transparent about what constitutes ESG performance and how ESG performance is measured, including information sources used. ▪ Theorization, commensurability, and transparency problems contribute to masking the true ESG risks and the performance of companies.","Abhayawansa, Subhash Tyagi Shailesh",The Journal of Wealth Management,,254

Twenty-two patients underwent whole-body [18F]-FDG PET, including a dedicated brain acquisition at our institution between May and December 2020 following their recovery after SARS-Cov2 infection. Fourteen of these patients presented isolated persistent hyposmia (smell diskettes olfaction test was used). A voxel-wise analysis (using Statistical Parametric Mapping software version 8 (SPM8)) was performed to identify brain regions of relative hypometabolism in patients with hyposmia with respect to controls. Structural connectivity of these regions was assessed (BCB toolkit). Relative hypometabolism was demonstrated in bilateral parahippocampal and fusiform gyri and in left insula in patients with respect to controls. Structural connectivity maps highlighted the involvement of bilateral longitudinal fasciculi.

The D-glucose uptake in the cortex of AD mice (1.70 ± 1.33%) was significantly reduced compared to that of wild-type mice (5.42 ± 0.70%, p = 0.0051). Also, a slower D-glucose uptake rate was found in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of AD mice (0.08 ± 0.01 min-1) compared to their wild-type counterpart (0.56 ± 0.1 min-1, p < 0.001), which suggests the presence of an impaired glucose transporter on both blood-brain and blood-CSF barriers of these AD mice. Clearance of D-glucose was observed in the CSF of wild-type mice but not AD mice, which suggests dysfunction of the glymphatic system in the AD mice. The results in this study indicate that onVDMP MRI could be a cost-effective and widely available method for simultaneously evaluating glucose transporter and glymphatic function of AD. This study also suggests that tau protein affects the D-glucose uptake and glymphatic impairment in AD at a time point preceding neurofibrillary tangle pathology.","Chen, Lin; Wei, Zhiliang; Chan, Kannie Wy; Li, Yuguo; Suchal, Kapil; Bi, Sheng; Huang, Jianpan; Xu, Xiang; Wong, Philip C; Lu, Hanzhang; van Zijl, Peter Cm; Li, Tong; Xu, Jiadi",J Cereb Blood Flow Metab,,254

The aim of this study was to describe the pattern of rotavirus genotype diversity from 2005 to 2018; to investigate changes following the introduction of the rotavirus vaccine in Fiji. Faecal samples from children less than 5 years with acute diarrhoea between 2005 to 2018 were analysed at the WHO Rotavirus Regional Reference Laboratory at the Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Melbourne, Australia, and positive samples were serotyped by EIA (2005-2006) or genotyped by heminested RT-PCR (2007 onwards). We observed a transient increase in the zoonotic strain equine-like G3P[8] in the initial period following vaccine introduction. G1P[8] and G2P[4], dominant genotypes prior to vaccine introduction, have not been detected since 2015 and 2014, respectively. A decrease in rotavirus genotypes G2P[8], G3P[6], G8P[8] and G9P[8] was also observed following vaccine introduction. Monitoring the rotavirus genotypes that cause diarrhoeal disease in children in Fiji is important to ensure that the rotavirus vaccine will continue to be protective and to enable early detection of new vaccine escape strains if this occurs.","Thomas, Sarah; Donato, Celeste M; Covea, Sokoveti; Ratu, Felisita T; Jenney, Adam W J; Reyburn, Rita; Sahu Khan, Aalisha; Rafai, Eric; Grabovac, Varja; Serhan, Fatima; Bines, Julie E; Russell, Fiona M",,,254
521990,A unique disaster response in aged residential dementia care: Can the experience inform future care models?,2021,"Background: in diabetes, multiple mHealth solutions were produced and implemented for self-management behaviors. However, little research on the effectiveness of psychological techniques implemented within these mHealth solutions was carried out, and even less with the elderly population where technological barriers might exist. Reliable evidence generated through a comprehensive evaluation of mHealth interventions may accelerate its growth for successful long-term implementation and to help to experience mHealth benefits in an enhanced way in all ages. Objective: this study aimed to review mHealth solutions for diabetes self-management in older adults (adherence to treatments and glycemic control) by analyzing the effectiveness of specific psychological techniques implemented. Methods: a narrative review was conducted following preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. PubMed (Medline) and American Psychological Association (APA) PsycInfo databases were searched for published papers that addressed eHealth solutions’ effectiveness for diabetes self-management. Studies in English, Spanish, and/or German of any design were screened, with no time constraints regarding the year of publication. A qualitative analysis of the selected papers was conducted in several steps. Results: this review found 38 studies setting up and analyzing mHealth solutions for older adults. Most research showed improvements in HbA1c, self-management behaviors, and medication adherence in T2DM patients post intervention. However, different mid-to-long term effects were found across studies, specifically concerning the maintenance and adherence to healthy behaviors. The most employed psychological framework was CBT, including techniques such as self-monitoring of outcome behaviors (mostly targeting glycemia measurements and healthy habits as physical activity and/or diet), tailored motivational feedback from medical staff, and psychoeducation or health coaches. The most successful mHealth intervention combined the feature of tailored feedback messages, interactive communication with healthcare professionals, and multifaceted functions. Conclusions: there is a lack of elaborate and detailed information in the literature regarding the factors considered in the design and development of mHealth solutions used as interventions for T2DM self-management in the elderly. Documentation and inclusion of such vital information will foster a transparent and shared decision-making process that will ultimately lead to the development of useful and user-friendly self-management apps that can enhance the quality of life for diabetes patients. Further research adapting mHealth solutions to older adults’ sensory deficits is necessary.","Vázquez-de Sebastián, Julia Ciudin Andreea Castellano-Tejedor Carmina",Journal of Clinical Medicine,,254

We studied the use of whole-lung low dose radiation therapy (LDRT) in this patient cohort. Methods and Materials : Patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and requiring mechanical ventilation for COVID-19 pneumonia were included in this randomized double-blind study. Patients were randomized to 1 Gy whole-lung LDRT or sham irradiation (sham-RT). Treatment group allocation was concealed from patients and ICU clinicians, who treated patients according to the current standard of care. Patients were followed for the primary endpoint of ventilator-free days (VFDs) at day 15 post-intervention. Secondary endpoints included overall survival, as well as changes in oxygenation and inflammatory markers. Results Twenty-two patients were randomized to either whole-lung LDRT or sham-RT between November and December 2020. Patients were generally elderly and comorbid, with a median age of 75 years in both arms. No difference in 15-day VFDs was observed between groups (p = 1.00), with a median of 0 days (range, 0-9) in the LDRT arm, and 0 days (range, 0-13) in the sham-RT arm. Overall survival at 28 days was identical at 63.6% (95%CI, 40.7-99.5%) in both arms (p = 0.69). Apart from a more pronounced reduction in lymphocyte counts following LDRT (p < 0.01), analyses of secondary endpoints revealed no significant differences between the groups.

It caused stress on the health care system of all countries. Presently, studies are emerging regarding the COVID-19 pandemic in different aspects. However, a few have explored barriers that affecting the practice of preventive measures for the COVID-19. As such, the study aimed to fill these research gaps in the study setting. METHODS: A semi-structured interview guide was used to conduct this phenomenological study among 16 key informants. Key informants were recruited by the purposive sampling method. To analyze that data, thematic content analysis was employed by using an inductive approach in NVivo 12 Pro software. RESULTS: In this study, six main themes were identified with the sub-themes. Overview of COVID-19 pandemic (with the six sub-themes), consequences (with the two sub-themes), perceived practice (with four sub-themes), perceived barriers (with four sub-themes), newfangled activities (with three sub-themes), and suggestion for improvement (with seven sub-themes) were the major themes. The participants perceived the influence of shortage of personal protective equipment and solutions for hand hygiene, negligence and ignorance, inadequate infrastructure, lack of training, and lack of attention and recognition for the staff on the practice of preventive measures. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed a gap in preventive measure practices for the COVID-19 in the health care system. Community influences, health care provider related barriers, institutional barriers, and lack of communication and support affect the practice. Hence, attention should give to fulfill the necessary supplies in the health facilities, improve the infrastructures, and equip health professionals by providing capacity-building activities. Besides, health care workers must recognize, and attention is needed.

Most of immune-related, non-classical features of GD1, including gammopathies and autoimmune diathesis, are resistant to macrophage-directed therapies. This has prompted a search for newer agents for human GD1. Here, we used high-density microarray on splenic and liver cells from affected GBA1(−/−) mice to establish a gene “signature”, which was then utilized to interrogate the Broad Institute database, CMAP. Computational connectivity mapping of disease and drug pairs through CMAP revealed several highly enriched, non-null, mimic and anti-mimic hits. Most notably, two compounds with anti-helminthic properties, namely albendazole and oxamniquine, were identified; these are particularly relevant for future testing as the expression of chitinases is enhanced in GD1.","Yuen, Tony; Iqbal, Jameel; Zhu, Ling-Ling; Sun, Li; Lin, Aiping; Zhao, Hongyu; Liu, Jun; Mistry, Pramod K.; Zaidi, Mone",Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X12008911; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.05.027; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006291X12008911; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22588172/; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3377787?pdf=render,254

Thus, 3′-SL was further studied for in vivo study against H9N2 virus in pathogen free chicken experiment models. In vivo study exhibited improved clinical symptoms on H9N2 infected chickens when treated with 3′-SL. Moreover, treating chickens with 3′-SL resulted in complete elimination of H9N2 viruses within 24 h of virus infection (0.8 HAU of H9N2). Indirect ELISA assay confirmed complete wash-out of H9N2 viruses from the colon after neutralization by 3′-SL without entering the blood stream. These in vivo results open up possible applications of 3′-SL for the prevention of AI virus infections in birds by a simple cleansing mechanism.","Pandey, Ramesh Prasad; Kim, Dae Hee; Woo, Jinsuk; Song, Jaeyoung; Jang, Sang Ho; Kim, Joon Bae; Cheong, Kwang Myun; Oh, Jin Sik; Sohng, Jae Kyung",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29416087/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-20955-4,254
595306,"Impact of Population Growth and Aging on Estimates of Excess U.S. Deaths During the COVID-19 Pandemic, March to August 2020",2020-12-15,"INTRODUCTION: Although the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted elective shoulder arthroplasty throughput, traumatic shoulder arthroplasty procedures are less apt to be postponed. We sought to evaluate shoulder arthroplasty utilization for fracture during the COVID-19 pandemic and California's associated shelter-in-place order compared to historical controls. METHODS: We conducted a cohort study with historical controls, identifying patients who underwent shoulder arthroplasty for proximal humerus fracture in California using our integrated electronic health record. The time period of interest was following the implementation of the statewide shelter-in-place order: March 19, 2020-May 31, 2020. This was compared to three historical periods: January 1, 2020-March 18, 2020, March 18, 2019-May 31, 2019, and January 1, 2019-March 18, 2019. Procedure volume, patient characteristics, in-hospital length of stay, and 30-day events (emergency department visit, readmission, infection, pneumonia, and death) were reported. Changes over time were analyzed using linear regression adjusted for usual seasonal and yearly changes and age, sex, comorbidities, and post-admission factors. RESULTS: Surgical volume dropped from an average of 4.4, 5.2, and 2.6 surgeries per week in the historical time periods, respectively, to 2.4 surgeries per week after shelter-in-place. While no more than 30% of all performed during any given week were for fracture during the historical time periods, arthroplasties performed for fracture was the overwhelming primary indication immediately after the shelter-in-place order. More patients were discharged the day of surgery (+33.2%, p=0.019) after the shelter-in-place order, but we did not observe a change in any of the corresponding 30-day events. CONCLUSIONS: The volume of shoulder arthroplasty for fracture dropped during the time of COVID-19. The reduction in volume could be due to less shoulder trauma due to shelter-in-place or a change in the indications for arthroplasty given the perceived higher risks associated with intubation and surgical care. We noted more patients undergoing shoulder arthroplasty for fracture were safely discharged on the day of surgery, suggesting this may be a safe practice that can be adopted moving forward.

Although there is no robust empirical research to demonstrate that liability protections actually influence physician behavior, we argue that limited liability protections for health care professionals who follow established CSC plans may instead be justified by reliance on the principle of reciprocity. Expecting physicians to do something they know will harm their patients causes moral distress and suffering that may leave lasting scars. Limited liability shields are both appropriate and proportionate to the risk physicians are being asked to take in such circumstances. Under certain narrow circumstances, it remains unclear that the standard of care is sufficiently flexible to protect physicians from liability. Given this uncertainty, the likelihood that physicians would be sued for such an act, and their desire for such immunity, this limited protection is morally legitimate.","Koch, Valerie Gutmann; Hoffmann, Diane E.",Hastings Cent Rep,https://doi.org/10.1002/hast.1255; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34028823/,254

Exposure to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) is known to exert cellular stress-mediated sterile inflammatory responses in exposed human tissues but may be lethal in sensitive species. Inflammation can be thought of as the extreme end of a spectrum ranging from homeostasis to stress responses (sterile inflammation) and to defense against infection (infectious inflammation). Defense against bacterial infection by generation of reactive oxygen species has to be strictly controlled and may use up a considerable amount of energy. NAD(+)-mediated energy metabolism adapts to various inflammatory responses. As examples, the present commentary tries to integrate responses of AHR and NAD(+)-consuming enzymes (PARP7/TiPARP, CD38 and sirtuins) into infectious and stress-induced inflammatory responses, the latter exemplified by nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). TCDD toxicity models in sensitive species provide hints to molecular AHR targets of energy metabolism including gluconeogenesis and glycolysis. AHR research remains challenging and promising.","Bock, Karl Walter",Arch Toxicol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00204-021-03134-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34559251/,254

Since the immune system can trigger serious pathophysiological disorders, it is essential to study and implement a type of nutrition aimed at improving immune system functioning and reinforcing it individually for each patient. In this sense, the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-1 (NOD1), one of the members of the pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) family of innate immunity, has been related to numerous pathologies, such as cancer, diabetes, or cardiovascular diseases. NOD1, which is activated by bacterial-derived peptidoglycans, is known to be present in immune cells and to contribute to inflammation and other important pathways, such as fibrosis, upon recognition of its ligands. Since immunonutrition is a significant developing research area with much to discover, we propose NOD1 as a possible target to consider in this field. It is relevant to understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms that modulate the immune system and involve the activation of NOD1 in the context of immunonutrition and associated pathological conditions. Surgical or pharmacological treatments could clearly benefit from the synergy with specific and personalized nutrition that even considers the health status of each subject.","Fernández-García, Victoria; González-Ramos, Silvia; Martín-Sanz, Paloma; Laparra, José M.; Boscá, Lisardo",Biomedicines,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34066406/; https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines9050519,254

An emerging field of microfluidics also known as the lab-on-a-chip (LOC) or micro total analysis system includes a wide range of diagnostic devices. This review briefly covers both conventional and microfluidics-based techniques for rapid viral detection. We first describe conventional detection methods such as cell culturing, immunofluorescence or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), or reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). These methods often have limited speed, sensitivity, or specificity and are performed with typically bulky equipment. Here, we discuss some of the LOC technologies that can overcome these demerits, highlighting the latest advances in LOC devices for viral disease diagnosis. We also discuss the fabrication of LOC systems to produce devices for performing either individual steps or virus detection in samples with the sample to answer method. The complete system consists of sample preparation, and ELISA and RT-PCR for viral-antibody and nucleic acid detection, respectively. Finally, we formulate our opinions on these areas for the future development of LOC systems for viral diagnostics.","Zhu, Hanliang; Fohlerová, Zdenka; Pekárek, Jan; Basova, Evgenia; Neužil, Pavel",Biosens Bioelectron,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2020.112041; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0956566320300385; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31999560/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956566320300385,254

As an add-on with conventional sepsis management for over 15 years, the effect of Xuebijing injection (XBJ) on the sepsis-induced myocardial dysfunction was not well understood. The material basis of Xuebijing injection (XBJ) in managing infections and infection-related complications remains to be defined. A murine cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) model and cardiomyocytes in vitro culture were adopted to study the influence of XBJ on infection-induced cardiac dysfunction. XBJ significantly improved the survival of septic-mice and rescued cardiac dysfunction in vivo. RNA-seq revealed XBJ attenuated the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and related signalings in the heart which was further confirmed on the mRNA and protein levels. Xuebijing also protected cardiomyocytes from LPS-induced mitochondrial calcium ion overload and reduced the LPS-induced ROS production in cardiomyocytes. The therapeutic effect of XBJ was mediated by the combination of paeoniflorin and hydroxysafflor yellow A (HSYA) (C0127-2). C0127-2 improved the survival of septic mice, protected their cardiac function and cardiomyocytes while balancing gene expression in cytokine-storm-related signalings, such as TNF-α and NF-κB. In summary, Paeoniflorin and HSYA are key active compounds in XBJ for managing sepsis, protecting cardiac function, and controlling inflammation in the cardiac tissue partially by limiting the production of IL-6, IL-1β, and CXCL2.","Wang, Xin-Tong; Peng, Zhen; An, Ying-Ying; Shang, Ting; Xiao, Guangxu; He, Shuang; Chen, Xi; Zhang, Han; Wang, Yuefei; Wang, Tao; Zhang, Jun-Hua; Gao, Xiumei; Zhu, Yan; Feng, Yuxin",Front Pharmacol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2020.614024; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33986658/,254

The disease can result in progressive respiratory failure in adults and the mortality rate has been reported to be 8–15%. This infection spreads by droplet transmission and children appear to acquire SARS through close household contact exposure to infected adults. Disease severity is, however, much milder in the paediatric age group. The common laboratory findings in infected children and adolescents include lymphopaenia and elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase and creatinine phosphokinase. Air space consolidation is commonly seen during the course of the illness although chest radiographs are normal on presentation in half of the cases. The pathophysiology of SARS appears to be related to immunological dysregulation in response to the coronavirus infection. The optimal treatment of SARS in children remains to be determined. No case fatality in infected children has been reported. The early and proper isolation of infected adults, meticulous infection control measures in the hospital setting, exhaustive contact tracing and quarantine measures are important steps in preventing the spread of the disease among health care workers and into the community.

Here, we report on the immune responses elicited by mucosal homologous plasmid and a heterologous immunization strategy using a plasmid vaccine and a Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) antigens. Only the heterologous intranasal immunization strategy elicited neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in serum and bronchoalveolar lavage of mice, suggesting a protective vaccine. The same prime/boost strategy led to the induction of type 1 and type 17 T-cell responses and polyfunctional T-cells expressing multiple type 1 cytokines (e.g., IFN-γ, TNFα, IL-2) in the lungs and spleens of vaccinated mice. In contrast, the plasmid homologous vaccine strategy led to the induction of local mono and polyfunctional T-cells secreting IFN-γ.

According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, myocarditis/pericarditis rates are ≈12.6 cases per million doses of second-dose mRNA vaccine among individuals 12 to 39 years of age. In reported cases, patients with myocarditis invariably presented with chest pain, usually 2 to 3 days after a second dose of mRNA vaccination, and had elevated cardiac troponin levels. ECG was abnormal with ST elevations in most, and cardiac MRI was suggestive of myocarditis in all tested patients. There was no evidence of acute COVID-19 or other viral infections. In 1 case, a cardiomyopathy gene panel was negative, but autoantibody levels against certain self-antigens and frequency of natural killer cells were increased. Although the mechanisms for development of myocarditis are not clear, molecular mimicry between the spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and self-antigens, trigger of preexisting dysregulated immune pathways in certain individuals, immune response to mRNA, and activation of immunologic pathways, and dysregulated cytokine expression have been proposed. The reasons for male predominance in myocarditis cases are unknown, but possible explanations relate to sex hormone differences in immune response and myocarditis, and also underdiagnosis of cardiac disease in women. Almost all patients had resolution of symptoms and signs and improvement in diagnostic markers and imaging with or without treatment. Despite rare cases of myocarditis, the benefit-risk assessment for COVID-19 vaccination shows a favorable balance for all age and sex groups; therefore, COVID-19 vaccination is recommended for everyone ≥12 years of age.","Bozkurt, Biykem; Kamat, Ishan; Hotez, Peter J.",Circulation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34281357/; https://doi.org/10.1161/circulationaha.121.056135,254

The positive single strand RNA genome of its causative agent, the SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) encodes all viral enzymes. In this work, we focus on one particular methyltransferase (MTase), nsp16, which in complex with nsp10 is capable of methylating the first nucleotide of a capped RNA strand at the 2′-O position. This process is part of a viral capping system and is crucial for viral evasion of the innate immune reaction. In light of recently discovered non-canonical RNA caps, we tested various dinucleoside polyphosphate-capped RNAs as substrates for nsp10-nsp16 MTase. We developed an LC-MS-based method and discovered five types of capped RNA (m7Gp3A(G)-, Gp3A(G)- and Gp4A-RNA) that are substrates of the nsp10-nsp16 MTase. Our technique is an alternative to the classical isotope labelling approach for measurement of 2′-O-MTase activity. Further, we determined the IC50 value of sinefungin (286 ± 66 nM) to illustrate the value of our approach for inhibitor screening.

Study findings suggest that individuals with a lifetime history of disordered eating behavior may be negatively affected by COVID-19–related anxiety, and prevention measures may disrupt daily functioning and limit access to treatment. However, data describing the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on disordered eating behaviors are limited, and most findings focus on individuals in treatment settings. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to characterize the experiences of Reddit users worldwide who post in eating disorder (ED)–related discussion forums describing the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on their overall mental health and disordered eating behavior. METHODS: Data were collected from popular subreddits acknowledging EDs as their primary discussion topic. Unique discussion posts dated from January 1 to May 31, 2020 that referenced the COVID-19 pandemic were extracted and evaluated using inductive, thematic data analysis. RESULTS: Six primary themes were identified: change in ED symptoms, change in exercise routine, impact of quarantine on daily life, emotional well-being, help-seeking behavior, and associated risks and health outcomes. The majority of users reported that the COVID-19 pandemic and associated public health prevention measures negatively impacted their psychiatric health and contributed to increased disordered eating behaviors. Feelings of isolation, frustration, and anxiety were common. Many individuals used Reddit forums to share personal experiences, seek advice, and offer shared accountability. CONCLUSIONS: Reddit discussion forums have provided a therapeutic community for individuals to share experiences and provide support for peers with ED during a period of increased psychiatric distress.

Depression, anxiety and stress presented significant correlations in common: negative with satisfaction with life, all dimensions of psychological well-being, and 3 adaptive copings (active coping, planning, positive reframing); positive with 5 maladaptive copings (behavioral disengagement, denial, self-blame, self-distraction, substance use). In addition, there were 7 common predictors for symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress: female; age 18–24 years old; having a chronic disease; lower scores in 2 dimensions of psychological well-being (positive relations with others, self-acceptance); higher scores in 2 maladaptive copings (self-blame, substance use). CONCLUSIONS: The data indicate a high prevalence of symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress, and suggest that higher scores of satisfaction with life, psychological well-being dimensions and adaptive copings may present protective effects in undergraduates during a pandemic crisis.","Lopes, Adriana Rezende; Nihei, Oscar Kenji",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34644347/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0258493,254

To identify host factors required for infection by SARS-CoV-2 and seasonal coronaviruses, we designed a focused high-coverage CRISPR-Cas9 library targeting 332 members of a recently published SARS-CoV-2 protein interactome. We leveraged the compact nature of this library to systematically screen SARS-CoV-2 at two physiologically relevant temperatures along with three related coronaviruses (human coronavirus 229E [HCoV-229E], HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-OC43), allowing us to probe this interactome at a much higher resolution than genome-scale studies. This approach yielded several insights, including potential virus-specific differences in Rab GTPase requirements and glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor biosynthesis, as well as identification of multiple pan-coronavirus factors involved in cholesterol homeostasis. This coronavirus essentiality catalog could inform ongoing drug development efforts aimed at intercepting and treating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and help prepare for future coronavirus outbreaks.","Hoffmann, H.-Heinrich; Sánchez-Rivera, Francisco J.; Schneider, William M.; Luna, Joseph M.; Soto-Feliciano, Yadira M.; Ashbrook, Alison W.; Le Pen, Jérémie; Leal, Andrew A.; Ricardo-Lax, Inna; Michailidis, Eleftherios; Hao, Yuan; Stenzel, Ansgar F.; Peace, Avery; Zuber, Johannes; Allis, C.

604004,Checklist para pacientes con diabetes mellitus tipo 2 en consulta telemática(),2021-03-18,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and has resulted in hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide. While the majority of people with COVID-19 won’t require hospitalization, those who do may experience severe life-threatening complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome. SARS-CoV-2 infects human cells by binding to the cellular surface protein angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2); in addition, the cellular transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) is needed for priming of the spike (S) protein of the virus. Virus entry may also depend on the activity of the endosomal/lysosomal cysteine proteases cathepsin B, L (CTSB, CTSL) although their activity is likely dispensable. Given that the uncertainty of how COVID-19 kills, hampers doctors’ ability to choose treatments the need for a deep understanding of COVID-19 biology is urgent. Herein, we performed an expression profiling meta-analysis of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and CTSB/L genes (and proteins) in public repository databases and found that all are widely expressed in human tissues; also, the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes tend to be co-regulated. The ACE2 and TMPRSS genes expression is (among others) suppressed by TNF, and is induced by pro-inflammatory conditions including obesity, Barrett's esophagus, stomach infection by helicobacter pylori, diabetes, autoimmune diseases and oxidized LDL; by exercise, as well as by growth factors, viruses’ infections, cigarette smoke, interferons and androgens. Regarding currently investigated therapies interferon-beta induced ACE2 gene expression in bronchial epithelial cells, while chloroquine tends to upregulate CTSB/L genes. Finally, we analyzed KEGG pathways modulated by ACE2, TMPRSS2 and CTSB/L and probed DrugBank for drugs that target modules of the affected pathways. Our data indicate possible novel high-risk groups for COVID-19; provide a rich resource for future investigations of its pathogenesis and highlight the therapeutic challenges we face.","Gkogkou, Eirini; Barnasas, Grigoris; Vougas, Konstantinos; Trougakos, Ioannis P.",Redox Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32863223/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S221323172030820X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221323172030820X?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.redox.2020.101615,254

However, the physiological relevance of apoptosis in the pathogenesis of coronavirus infections is unknown. Here, with a combination of in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo models, we demonstrated that protein kinase R–like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) signaling mediated the proapoptotic signals in Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection, which converged in the intrinsic apoptosis pathway. Inhibiting PERK signaling or intrinsic apoptosis both alleviated MERS pathogenesis in vivo. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and SARS-CoV induced apoptosis through distinct mechanisms but inhibition of intrinsic apoptosis similarly limited SARS-CoV-2– and SARS-CoV–induced apoptosis in vitro and markedly ameliorated the lung damage of SARS-CoV-2–inoculated human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) mice. Collectively, our study provides the first evidence that virus-induced apoptosis is an important disease determinant of highly pathogenic coronaviruses and demonstrates that this process can be targeted to attenuate disease severity.","Chu, Hin; Shuai, Huiping; Hou, Yuxin; Zhang, Xi; Wen, Lei; Huang, Xiner; Hu, Bingjie; Yang, Dong; Wang, Yixin; Yoon, Chaemin; Wong, Bosco Ho-Yin; Li, Cun; Zhao, Xiaoyu; Poon, Vincent Kwok-Man; Cai, Jian-Piao; Wong, Kenneth Kak-Yuen; Yeung, Man-Lung; Zhou, Jie; Au-Yeung, Rex Kwok-Him; Yuan, Shuofeng; Jin, Dong-Yan; Kok, Kin-Hang; Perlman, Stanley; Chan, Jasper Fuk-Woo; Yuen, Kwok-Yung",Sci Adv,https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abf8577; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34134991/,254

The purpose of the present study was to explore the modulation of gene expression of some immune-inflammatory markers in buffaloes suffered from various digestive disorders. For this reason, 50 native breed water buffaloes were studied. Forty of these buffaloes showed various symptoms of digestive disorders and were allocated into 4 groups of equal sizes (group 1: uncategorized stomatitis; group 2: acute traumatic reticuloperitonitis [TRR]; group 3: acute rumen impaction; and group 4: undifferentiated enteritis). Ten apparently healthy buffaloes were randomly selected and considered as a control group. RNA was firstly extracted from the whole blood then a reverse transcription kits was used to convert the RNA to cDNA. Real-time PCR was used to measure the expression of mRNAs of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, IgG, and IgA, while glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) used as an internal reference. The results of real-time PCR revealed a significant (P ≤ 0.05) upregulation of the gene expression of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α in blood of diseased buffaloes compared with those of controls. Animals showing acute TRP had peak values of both IL-6 and IL-10; while those exhibiting enteritis and rumen impaction had the highest values of IL-1β and TNF-α, respectively. The results of qPCR also revealed a significant (P ≤ 0.05) downregulation of both IgG and IgA gene expression in blood of all diseased buffaloes compared with controls. The lowest values of both genes were recorded in buffaloes showing acute TRP. The results herein suggest that the tested genes could have a pivotal role in the pathophysiologic mechanism of the underlying diseases.","Youssef, Mohamed A.; El-Ashker, Maged R.; Ouda, Mohamed F.",Comp Clin Path,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32214977/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00580-017-2496-1,254
604793,Adaption of the emergency department decontamination room for airway management during COVID-19,2020-04-15,"BACKGROUND: Vaccination is an effective way to curtail the burden of COVID-19 in which success depends on a high acceptance of the vaccine. However, addressing concerns among vaccine-hesitant individuals is essential to avoid failure of the immunisation programme. This study sought to assess the concerns and acceptance rates regarding the COVID-19 vaccine among Malaysians. METHODS: An online questionnaire was distributed to 1411 respondents via a snowball sampling method among Malaysians aged 18 years and above. RESULTS: The majority of the respondents were young adults (40.7%), female (62.8%), Malay (63.8%), Muslim (72.3%), married (52.9%), with tertiary education (86.8%) and without medical illness (85%). Social media (97.4%) was the primary source of information regarding COVID-19. The overall acceptance rate was high (83.3%), with the lowest rates among the elderly aged 60 years and above (63.4%) and pensioners (64.6%). Hesitance was caused by concerns regarding side effects (95.8%), safety (84.7%), lack of information (80.9%), effectiveness (63.6%) and religious (20.8%) and cultural factors related to the COVID-19 vaccine (6.8%). Respondents with diabetes mellitus (24.7%) and hypercholesterolemia (23%) were more hesitant to accept the COVID-19 vaccine, at 16.1 and 15.8%, respectively. Predictors of COVID-19 vaccine hesitance were age, religion, and current residence. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate a high rate of acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine among Malaysians. Thus, the Malaysian government and other related agencies should increase their campaign and prepare to implement the COVID-19 mass immunisation programme among Malaysians. However, despite the high acceptance rate, it remains important to address concerns among hesitant individuals by building trust in vaccine safety and effectiveness through adequate information regarding the vaccine.

While biological, socioeconomic and clinical risk factors have been identified among the general population, a comprehensive assessment of risk factors for COVID-19 infection among PwMS is lacking. Methods A survey assessing personal experiences with COVID-19 in the USA was distributed online via the iConquerMS platform from December 18, 2020 to February 10, 2021. We conducted a retrospective nested case–control study of PwMS who self-reported testing positive for COVID-19 versus not. Risk factors evaluated include age, occupational setting, social determinants of health index, physical disability via Patient-Determined Disease Steps, disease-modifying therapy (DMT) and progressive disease. Results Of 611 PwMS, 47 (7.7%) self-reported a positive COVID-19 test. DMT use (odds ratio [95% CI]: 2.10 [0.75–5.39]) and employment outside the home (2.79 [1.42–5.41]) increased risk of COVID-19 infection, while older age (0.97 [0.95–0.99]), increased disability (0.81 [0.69–0.94]) and progressive disease (0.42 [0.19–0.86]) decreased risk in univariate analyses. No risk factor remained significant in the multivariate model. Of the 47 PwMS with a positive test, seven were admitted to the hospital, of whom two required intensive care. Forty-three (91.5%) experienced common COVID-19 symptoms, and 23 (48.9%) reported concurrent new/worsening neurological symptoms. Conclusion The prevalence of COVID-19 infection in this online study of PwMS approximated the US population's prevalence.

606881,Authors’ reply to: Comment on the article by Dr. N. Shakrawal: Barrier device prototype for open tracheotomy during COVID-19 pandemic,2020-10-26,"INTRODUCTION: During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, policymakers have to make far-reaching decisions that should be supported by scientific evidence. This presents a major challenge, given the limited availability of evidence, especially in the early phases of the pandemic. Decision-makers thus turned to scientific experts to help to convey and contextualize the evidence for public health policymaking. The way in which these experts were consulted varied widely. Some decision-makers called on expert committees in which they convened multiple experts from different disciplines. However, the composition and role of these committees have raised questions of transparency and representation. This study examines whether and how expert committees in Germany were convened at the federal and national level to advise governments and ministries during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. We investigated the disciplinary composition, gender representation and the transparency related to the convening of these bodies, work processes and the accessibility of results. METHODS: We performed a multi-stage document analysis. Between May and July 2020, we submitted freedom-of-information requests to the governmental institutions at both a federal and a national level. In addition to analysing the responses to these requests, we conducted a thorough search and analysis of the i) pandemic preparedness plans, (ii) official press releases and (iii) minor interpellations (“Kleine Anfragen”) at the federal and state level. We included documents on expert committees in the SARS-CoV-2 context for the period from January to the beginning of December 2020 and carried out a qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: We identified a total of 21 expert committees that were established in ten federal states and four federal ministries. In eleven committees, the members were known by name with women making up 26 % of the members. Biomedical disciplines such as virology, hygiene, medicine, and biology were the most commonly represented. Other disciplines including economics, law and sociology, and non-scientific experts were represented in seven federal states. The members of ten committees were not known by name. These committees covered different thematic areas (school and day-care, civil participation, medicine and care, economic topics), and their members were more commonly practitioners or affected populations. DISCUSSION: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has led to an increased consultation of experts in public health policymaking. However, expert committees in Germany are not sufficiently representative and interdisciplinary to take different perspectives into account and ultimately advise politicians in complex pandemic situations. Furthermore, the work of these committees is not sufficiently transparent because access to information is limited. CONCLUSION: Due to this lack of transparency, it is unclear whether and how the expert committees exerted an influence on politics. Transparency of political decision-making processes and the consideration of pluralistic perspectives are considered essential for the legitimation and quality of political decisions in a pandemic and should therefore be strengthened in pandemic management in Germany.","Sell, Kerstin; Saringer-Hamiti, Lea; Geffert, Karin; Strahwald, Brigitte; Stratil, Jan M.; Pfadenhauer, Lisa M.",Z Evid Fortbild Qual Gesundhwes,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1865921721001136; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34474991/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.zefq.2021.06.002; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1865921721001136,254

609793,The Rapid Evaluation of COVID-19 Vaccination in Emergency Departments for Underserved Patients Study,2021-05-31,"BACKGROUND: South Africa has high burdens of tuberculosis (TB) and TB-HIV, yet the quality of patient care in the private sector is unknown. We describe quality of TB and TB-HIV care among private general practitioners (GPs) in two South African cities using standardised patients (SPs). METHODS: Sixteen SPs presented one of three cases during unannounced visits to private GPs in selected high-TB burden communities in Durban and Cape Town: case 1, typical TB symptoms, HIV-positive; case 2, TB-specified laboratory report, HIV-negative and case 3, history of incomplete TB treatment, HIV-positive. Clinical practices were recorded in standardised exit interviews. Ideal management was defined as relevant testing or public sector referral for any reason. The difference between knowledge and practice (know-do gap) was assessed through case 1 vignettes among 25% of GPs. Factors associated with ideal management were assessed using bivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: 511 SP visits were completed with 212 GPs. Respectively, TB and HIV were ideally managed in 43% (95% CI 36% to 50%) and 41% (95% CI 34% to 48%) of case 1, 85% (95% CI 78% to 90%) and 61% (95% CI 73% to 86%) of case 2 and 69% (95% CI 61% to 76%) and 80% (95% CI 52% to 68%) of case 3 presentations. HIV status was queried in 35% (95% CI 31% to 39%) of visits, least with case 1 (24%, 95% CI 18% to 30%). The difference between knowledge and practice was 80% versus 43% for TB and 55% versus 37% for HIV, resulting in know-do gaps of 37% (95% CI 19% to 55%) and 18% (95% CI −1% to 38%), respectively. Ideal TB management was associated with longer visit time (OR=1.1, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.2), female GPs (3.2, 95% CI 2.0 to 5.1), basic symptom inquiry (2.0, 95% CI 1.7 to 2.3), HIV-status inquiry (OR=11.2, 95% CI 6.4 to 19.6), fewer medications dispensed (OR=0.6, 95% CI 0.5 to 0.7) and Cape Town (OR=2.2, 95% CI 1.5 to 3.1). Similar associations were observed for HIV. CONCLUSIONS: Private providers ideally managed TB more often when a diagnosis or history of TB was implied or provided. Management of HIV in the context of TB was less than optimal.","Boffa, Jody; Moyo, Sizulu; Chikovore, Jeremiah; Salomon, Angela; Daniels, Benjamin; Kwan, Ada T; Pai, Madhukar; Daftary, Amrita",BMJ Glob Health,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2021-005250; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33990360/,254

We aimed to assess risk factors associated with ICH in this population. We performed a retrospective cohort study of adult patients admitted to NYU Langone Health system between March 1 and April 27 2020 with a positive nasopharyngeal swab polymerase chain reaction test result and presence of primary nontraumatic intracranial hemorrhage or hemorrhagic conversion of ischemic stroke on neuroimaging. Patients with intracranial procedures, malignancy, or vascular malformation were excluded. We used regression models to estimate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (OR, 95% CI) of the association between ICH and covariates. We also used regression models to determine association between ICH and mortality. Among 3824 patients admitted with COVID-19, 755 patients had neuroimaging and 416 patients were identified after exclusion criteria were applied. The mean (standard deviation) age was 69.3 (16.2), 35.8% were women, and 34.9% were on therapeutic anticoagulation. ICH occurred in 33 (7.9%) patients. Older age, non-Caucasian race, respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, and therapeutic anticoagulation were associated with ICH on univariate analysis (p < 0.01 for each variable). In adjusted regression models, anticoagulation use was associated with a five-fold increased risk of ICH (OR 5.26, 95% CI 2.33–12.24, p < 0.001). ICH was associated with increased mortality (adjusted OR 2.6, 95 % CI 1.2–5.9). Anticoagulation use is associated with increased risk of ICH in patients with COVID-19.

This system offers the possibility of performing 4608 qPCR end-points in a single run, equivalent to 192 clinical samples combined with 12 pairs of primers/probe sets in duplicate, thus allowing the monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 including the detection of specific SARS-CoV-2 variants, as well as the detection other pathogens and/or host cellular responses (virus receptors, response markers, microRNAs). The 10 nL-range volume of Biomark(TM) reactions is compatible with sensitive and reproducible reactions that can be easily and cost-effectively adapted to various RT-qPCR configurations and sets of primers/probe. Finally, we also evaluated the use of inactivating lysis buffers composed of various detergents in the presence or absence of proteinase K to assess the compatibility of these buffers with a direct reverse transcription enzymatic step and we propose several protocols, bypassing the need for RNA purification. We advocate that the combined utilization of an optimized processing buffer and a high-throughput real-time PCR device would contribute to improve the turn-around-time to deliver the test results to patients and increase the SARS-CoV-2 testing capacities.","Fassy, Julien; Lacoux, Caroline; Leroy, Sylvie; Noussair, Latifa; Hubac, Sylvain; Degoutte, Aurélien; Vassaux, Georges; Leclercq, Vianney; Rouquié, David; Marquette, Charles-Hugo; Rottman, Martin; Touron, Patrick; Lemoine, Antoinette; Herrmann, Jean-Louis; Barbry, Pascal; Nahon, Jean-Louis; Zaragosi, Laure-Emmanuelle; Mari, Bernard",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0243333; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33852580/,254

Surface disinfection may interrupt transmission, but few data exist on the effectiveness of health care germicides against coronaviruses on surfaces. METHODS: The efficacy of health care germicides against 2 surrogate coronaviruses, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), was tested using the quantitative carrier method on stainless steel surfaces. Germicides were o-phenylphenol/p-tertiary amylphenol) (a phenolic), 70% ethanol, 1:100 sodium hypochlorite, ortho-phthalaldehyde (OPA), instant hand sanitizer (62% ethanol), and hand sanitizing spray (71% ethanol). RESULTS: After 1-minute contact time, for TGEV, there was a log(10) reduction factor of 3.2 for 70% ethanol, 2.0 for phenolic, 2.3 for OPA, 0.35 for 1:100 hypochlorite, 4.0 for 62% ethanol, and 3.5 for 71% ethanol. For MHV, log(10) reduction factors were 3.9 for 70% ethanol, 1.3 for phenolic, 1.7 for OPA, 0.62 for 1:100 hypochlorite, 2.7 for 62% ethanol, and 2.0 for 71% ethanol. CONCLUSION: Only ethanol reduced infectivity of the 2 coronaviruses by >3-log(10) after 1 minute. Germicides must be chosen carefully to ensure they are effective against viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus.","Hulkower, Rachel L.; Casanova, Lisa M.; Rutala, William A.; Weber, David J.; Sobsey, Mark D.",Am J Infect Control,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21256627/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196655310009004; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196655310009004; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2010.08.011,254
614853,Early Observation and Mitigation of Challenges in Diabetes Management of COVID-19 Patients in Critical Care Units,2020-05-22,"Inhalation offers a means of rapid, local delivery of siRNA to treat a range of autoimmune or inflammatory respiratory conditions. This work investigated the potential of a linear 10 kDa Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-modified 25 kDa branched polyethyleneimine (PEI) (PEI-LPEG) to effectively deliver siRNA to airway epithelial cells. Following optimization with anti- glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) siRNA, PEI and PEI-LPEG anti-IL8 siRNA nanoparticles were assessed for efficacy using polarised Calu-3 human airway epithelial cells and a twin stage impinger (TSI) in vitro lung model. Studies were then advanced to an in vivo lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated rodent model of inflammation. In parallel, the suitability of the siRNA-loaded nanoparticles for nebulization using a vibrating mesh nebuliser was assessed. The siRNA nanoparticles were nebulised using an Aerogen(®) Pro vibrating mesh nebuliser and characterised for aerosol output, droplet size and fine particle fraction. Only PEI anti-IL8 siRNA nanoparticles were capable of significant levels of IL-8 knockdown in vitro in non-nebulised samples. However, on nebulization through a TSI, only PEI-PEG siRNA nanoparticles demonstrated significant decreases in gene and protein expression in polarised Calu-3 cells. In vivo, both anti-CXCL-1 (rat IL-8 homologue) nanoparticles demonstrated a decreased CXCL-1 gene expression in lung tissue, but this was non-significant. However, PEI anti-CXCL-1 siRNA-treated rats were found to have significantly less infiltrating macrophages in their bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. Overall, the in vivo gene and protein inhibition findings indicated a result more reminiscent of the in vitro bolus delivery rather than the in vitro nebulization data. This work demonstrates the potential of nebulised PEI-PEG siRNA nanoparticles in modulating pulmonary inflammation and highlights the need to move towards more relevant in vitro and in vivo models for respiratory drug development.","Hibbitts, Alan J.; Ramsey, Joanne M.; Barlow, James; MacLoughlin, Ronan; Cryan, Sally-Ann",Nanomaterials (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/nano10071248; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32605011/,254

Pharmacovigilance centres permanently monitor the safety profile of medicines, ensuring risk management to evaluate the benefit-risk relationship. However, traditional pharmacovigilance approaches of spontaneous reporting, are not suitable in the context of a pandemic; the scientific community and regulators need information on a near real-time point. The aim of this commentary is to suggest six interrelated multidimensional guiding axes for drug safety management by pharmacovigilance centres during the COVID-19 pandemic. This working plan can increase knowledge on COVID-19 and associated therapeutic approaches, support decisions by the regulatory authorities, oppose fake news and promote more efficient public health protection.","Ferreira-da-Silva, Renato; Ribeiro-Vaz, Inês; Morato, Manuela; Polónia, Jorge Junqueira",Int J Clin Pharm,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34076805/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11096-021-01289-0,254

Neurological manifestations can range from nonspecific symptoms such as dizziness, headaches and olfactory disturbances to severe forms of neurological dysfunction. Some neurological complication can occur even after mild forms of respiratory disease. This study’s aims were to assess cerebrovascular reactivity in patients with nonspecific neurological symptoms after SARS-CoV-2 infection. A total of 25 patients, aged 33–62 years, who had nonspecific neurological symptoms after SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as 25 healthy participants in the control group, were assessed for cerebrovascular reactivity according to transcranial color Doppler (TCCD) which we combined with a breath-holding test (BHT). In subjects after SARS-CoV-2 infection, there were statistically significantly lower flow velocities through the middle cerebral artery at rest period, lower maximum velocities at the end of the breath-holding period and lower breath holding index (BHI) in relation to the control group. Changes in cerebral artery flow rate velocities indicate poor cerebral vasoreactivity in the group after SARS-CoV-2 infection in regard to the control group and suggest vascular endothelial damage by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.","Marcic, Marino; Marcic, Ljiljana; Marcic, Barbara; Capkun, Vesna; Vukojevic, Katarina",J Pers Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34066352/; https://doi.org/10.3390/jpm11050379,254

MATERIALS AND METHODS: From March 2020 to December 2020, 56 consecutive children (33 males and 23 girls; mean age ± SD, 14.8 ± 5.0 years; range, 9 months–18 years) with mild to moderate symptom and laboratory confirmed COVID‐19 (based on Centers for Disease Control criteria) underwent both chest radiography and chest CT on the same day within the first 2 days of initial presentation to the hospital. Two experienced radiologists independently evaluated chest radiographs and chest CT studies for thoracic abnormalities. The findings from chest radiography and chest CT were compared to evaluate the added diagnostic value of chest CT for affecting patient management. Interobserver agreement was measured with Cohen's κ statistics. RESULTS: Eleven (19.6%) of 56 patients had abnormal chest radiographic findings, including ground‐glass opacity (GGO) in 5/11 (45.4%) and combined GGO and consolidation in 6/11 (54.5%). On chest CT, 26 (46.4%) of 56 patients had abnormal CT findings, including combined GGO and consolidation in 19/26 (73.1%), GGO in 6/26 (23.1%), and consolidation in 1/26 (3.8%). Chest CT detected all thoracic abnormalities seen on chest radiography in 11/26 (42.3%) cases. In 15/26 (57.7%), chest CT detected lung abnormalities that were not observed on chest radiography, which included GGO and consolidation in 9/15 (60%), GGO in 5/15 (33.3%), and consolidation in 1/15 (6.6%) cases. These additional CT findings did not affect patient management. In addition, chest CT detected radiological signs and patterns, including the halo sign, reversed halo sign, crazy paving pattern, and tree‐in‐bud pattern. There was almost perfect interobserver agreement between the two reviewers for detecting findings on both chest radiographs (κ, 0.89, p = .001) and chest CT (κ, 0.96, p = .001) studies. CONCLUSION: Chest CT detected lung abnormalities, including GGO and/or consolidation, that were not observed on chest radiography in more than half of symptomatic pediatric patients with COVID‐19 pneumonia. However, these additional CT findings did not affect patient management. Therefore, CT is not clinically indicated for the initial evaluation of mild to moderately symptomatic pediatric patients with COVID‐19 pneumonia.","Das, Karuna M.; Alkoteesh, Jamal A.; Al Kaabi, Jumaa; Al Mansoori, Taleb; Winant, Abbey J.; Singh, Rajvir; Paraswani, Rajesh; Syed, Rizwan; Sharif, Elsadeg M.; Balhaj, Ghazala B.; Lee, Edward Y.",Pediatr Pulmonol,https://doi.org/10.1002/ppul.25313; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33631061/,254
619787,Risk Compensation and COVID-19 Vaccines,2021-03-02,"The hospital wastewater imposes a potent threat to the security of human health concerning its high vulnerability towards the outbreak of several diseases. Furthermore, the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic demanded a global attention towards monitoring viruses and other infectious pathogens in hospital wastewater and their removal. Apart from that, the presence of various recalcitrant organics, pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs), etc. imparts a complex pollution load to water resources and ecosystem. In this review, an insight into the occurrence, persistence and removal of drug-resistant microorganisms and infectious viruses as well as other micro-pollutants have been documented. The performance of various pilot/full-scale studies have been evaluated in terms of removal of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), total suspended solids (TSS), PhACs, pathogens, etc. It was found that many biological processes, such as membrane bioreactor, activated sludge process, constructed wetlands, etc. provided more than 80% removal of BOD, COD, TSS, etc. However, the removal of several recalcitrant organic pollutants are less responsive to those processes and demands the application of tertiary treatments, such as adsorption, ozone treatment, UV treatment, etc. Antibiotic-resistant microorganisms, viruses were found to be persistent even after the treatment of hospital wastewater, and high dose of chlorination or UV treatment was required to inactivate them. This article circumscribes the various emerging technologies, which have been used to treat PhACs and pathogens.

However, real-time RT-PCR offers a rapid, sensitive, specific and easy tool for nucleic acid detection. The objective of this study was to design a TaqMan probe-based, real-time RT-PCR assay for detection of FCV. It was determined in our previous study that the first 120 nucleotides of the 5′ region of the genome are highly conserved among FCV isolates. Primers and a probe specific for this region were designed for a real-time RT-PCR assay to detect FCV. Initial validation was done using 15 genetically diverse isolates. Also, 122 samples were tested by the new assay and virus isolation. The real-time RT-PCR assay was as sensitive and specific as virus isolation and was far more rapid.

626341,"Updates on ""Barrier device for open tracheostomy during the COVID-19 pandemic""",2020-10-28,"BACKGROUND: Information literacy competency is one of the requirements to implement Evidence-Based Practice (EBP) in nursing. It is necessary to pay attention to curricular development and use new educational methods such as virtual education to strengthen information literacy competency in nursing students. Given the scarcity of the studies on the effectiveness of virtual education in nursing, particularly in Iran, and the positive university atmosphere regarding the use of virtual education, this study investigated the effect of virtual education on the undergraduate nursing students’ information literacy competency for EBP. METHODS: This interventional study was performed with two groups of intervention and control and a pretest and posttest design. Seventy-nine nursing students were selected and assigned to the intervention or control groups by random sampling. Virtual education of the information literacy was uploaded on a website in the form of six modules delivered in four weeks. Questionnaires of demographic information and information literacy for EBP were used to collect data before and one month after the virtual education. RESULTS: The results showed no significant difference between the control and intervention groups in all dimensions of information literacy competency in the pre-test stage. In the post-test, the virtual education improved dimensions of information seeking skills (t = 3.14, p = 0.002) and knowledge about search operators (t = 39.84, p = 0.001) in the intervention groups compared with the control group. The virtual education did not have any significant effect on the use of different information resources and development of search strategy with assessing the frequency of selecting the most appropriate search statement in the intervention group. CONCLUSION: Virtual education had a significant effect on information seeking skills and knowledge about search operators in nursing students. Nurse educators can benefit from our experiences in designing this method for the use of virtual education programs in nursing schools. Given the lack of effectiveness of this program in using different information resources and development of search strategy, nurse educators are recommended to train information literacy for EBP by integrating several approaches such as virtual (online and offline) and face-to-face education.","Shamsaee, Maryam; Mangolian shahrbabaki, Parvin; Ahmadian, Leila; Farokhzadian, Jamileh; Fatehi, Farhad",BMC Med Inform Decis Mak,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33563279/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12911-021-01418-9,254

We developed and evaluated a novel, community-based approach (‘Test-to-Care’ Model) designed to address these barriers for socioeconomically vulnerable Latinx individuals with newly diagnosed COVID-19 and their households. METHODS: This three-week demonstration project was nested within an epidemiologic surveillance study in a primarily Latinx neighborhood in the Mission district of San Francisco, California. The Test-to-Care model was developed with input from community members and public health leaders. Key components included: (1) provision of COVID-19-related education and information about available community resources, (2) home deliveries of material goods to facilitate safe isolation and quarantine (groceries, personal protective equipment and cleaning supplies), and (3) longitudinal clinical and social support. Newly SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive participants were eligible to participate. Components of the model were delivered by the Test-to-Care team, which was comprised of healthcare providers and community health workers (CHWs) who provided longitudinal clinic- and community-based support for the duration of the isolation period to augment existing services from the Department of Public Health (DPH). We evaluated the Test-to-Care Model using the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance (RE-AIM) Framework and drew upon multiple data sources including: programmatic data, informal interviews with participants and providers/CHWs and structured surveys among providers/CHWs. RESULTS: Overall, 83 participants in the surveillance study were diagnosed with COVID-19, of whom 95% (79/83) were Latinx and 88% (65/74) had an annual household income <$50,000. Ninety-six percent (80/83) of participants were reached for results disclosure, needs assessment and DPH linkage for contact tracing. Among those who underwent an initial needs assessment, 45% (36/80) were uninsured and 55% (44/80) were not connected to primary care. Sixty-seven percent (56/83) of participants requested community-based CHW support to safely isolate at their current address and 65% (54/83) of all COVID-19 participants received ongoing community support via CHWs for the entire self-isolation period. Participants reported that the intervention was highly acceptable and that their trust increased over time–this resulted in 9 individuals who disclosed a larger number of household members than first reported, and 6 persons who requested temporary relocation to a hotel room for isolation despite initially declining this service; no unintended harms were identified. The Test-to-Care Model was found to be both acceptable and feasible to providers and CHWs. Challenges identified included a low proportion of participants linked to primary care despite support (approximately 10% after one month), and insufficient access to financial support for wage replacement. CONCLUSIONS: The Test-to-Care Model is a feasible and acceptable intervention for supporting self-isolation and quarantine among newly diagnosed COVID-19 patients and their households by directly addressing key barriers faced by socioeconomically vulnerable populations.","Kerkhoff, Andrew D.; Sachdev, Darpun; Mizany, Sara; Rojas, Susy; Gandhi, Monica; Peng, James; Black, Douglas; Jones, Diane; Rojas, Susana; Jacobo, Jon; Tulier-Laiwa, Valerie; Petersen, Maya; Martinez, Jackie; Chamie, Gabriel; Havlir, Diane V.; Marquez, Carina",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33035216/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0239400,254

In this paper, we focus on the application value of the second-generation sequencing technology in the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary infectious diseases with the aid of the deep reinforcement learning. Specifically, the rapid, comprehensive, and accurate identification of pathogens is a prerequisite for clinicians to choose timely and targeted treatment. Thus, in this work, we present representative deep reinforcement learning methods that are potential to identify pathogens for lung infection treatment. After that, current status of pathogenic diagnosis of pulmonary infectious diseases and their main characteristics are summarized. Furthermore, we analyze the common types of second-generation sequencing technology, which can be used to diagnose lung infection as well. Finally, we point out the challenges and possible future research directions in integrating deep reinforcement learning with second-generation sequencing technology to diagnose and treat lung infection, which is prospective to accelerate the evolution of smart healthcare with medical Internet of Things and big data.","Liu, Zhuo; Zhang, Gerui; Jingyuan, Zhao; Yu, Liyan; Sheng, Junxiu; Zhang, Na; Yuan, Hong",J Healthc Eng,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32184978/; https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/3264801,254
629286,The calculated responses against COVID-19 in Namibia,2020-10-16,"The philosophy underlying the creation of the devolved institutions in Wales and Scotland was expansive, leading to a growth in powers over twenty years. That approach is now under challenge following recent Brexit legislation, which marks a sharp contrast with the unionist approaches of the past. The Covid‐19 pandemic provided a visibility boost for devolution, while exposing existing tensions in intergovernmental relations. This article identifies four forms of unionism in operation over the last twenty years—passive, activist, progressive and muscular—and questions whether muscular unionism can now be considered a form of statecraft. Those ‘progressive unionists’ who advocate further devolution should avoid ‘constitutional determinism’—the assumption that muscular unionism will inevitably lead to a breakup of the UK unless further constitutional reform takes place.

The use of cloth masks during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is under debate. The filtration effectiveness of cloth masks is generally lower than that of medical masks and respirators; however, cloth masks may provide some protection if well designed and used correctly. Multilayer cloth masks, designed to fit around the face and made of water-resistant fabric with a high number of threads and finer weave, may provide reasonable protection. Until a cloth mask design is proven to be equally effective as a medical or N95 mask, wearing cloth masks should not be mandated for healthcare workers. In community settings, however, cloth masks may be used to prevent community spread of infections by sick or asymptomatically infected persons, and the public should be educated about their correct use.","Chughtai, Abrar A.; Seale, Holly; Macintyre, C.

630097,Love in the Time of Corona,2020-03-31,"BACKGROUND: Patients receiving hemodialysis treatment are among the risk groups during the COVID-19 pandemic. They must cope with many factors simultaneously like anxiety about being ill, social isolation, inadequate information about protective precautions, and the need to attend regular treatment. OBJECTIVES: This study was performed with the aim of determining problems experienced by individuals receiving hemodialysis treatment during the pandemic. DESIGN: This was a descriptive and cross-sectional type study. PARTICIPANTS: The research included 234 patients receiving chronic hemodialysis treatment. MEASUREMENTS: For collection of data in the research, a patient descriptive information form and COVID-19 phobia scale (CP19-S) scale were used. RESULTS: Patients receiving hemodialysis treatment were determined to have high levels of compliance with individual precautions required during the pandemic. Of patients, 87.6% were determined to experience concern about bringing infection from the dialysis unit to family members. The mean total points for CP19-S were 59.80 ± 14.49. Patients who were female, had low educational level, were not employed, had heart disease in addition to kidney failure, with hemodialysis age from 6 to 8 years, who did not want to go to the dialysis center and had not received education about the pandemic (p < 0.001) were identified to have high phobia at statistically significant levels. CONCLUSIONS: Changes occurring in normal life and to hemodialysis treatment during the pandemic cause concern and anxiety in many patients. In this process, providing patients with education about the pandemic and protective methods is very important.","Bulbul, Elif; Dogan, Pinar; Sendir, Merdiye; Kaya, Abdulsamed; Ozdemir, Cevriye",Hemodial. int,https://doi.org/10.1111/hdi.12960; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34196085/,254

These issues are particularly salient in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, which created rapid demand for novel therapies in the absence of robust evidence. OBJECTIVE: To identify psychological traits associated with physicians' willingness to treat with unproven therapies and willingness to update their treatment preferences in the setting of new evidence in the context of COVID-19. METHODS: We administered a longitudinal e-mail survey to United States physicians board-certified in intensive care medicine in April and May, 2020 (phase one); and October and November, 2020 (phase two). We assessed five psychological traits potentially related to evidence-uptake: need for cognition, evidence skepticism, need for closure, risk tolerance, and research engagement. We then examined the relationship between these traits and physician preferences for pharmacological treatment for a hypothetical patient with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. RESULTS: There were 592 responses to the phase one survey, conducted prior to publication of trial data. At this time physicians were most willing to treat with macrolide antibiotics (50.5%), followed by antimalaria agents (36.1%), corticosteroids (24.5%), antiretroviral agents (22.6%), and angiotensin inhibitors (4.4%). Greater evidence skepticism (relative risk, RR=1.40, 95% CI: 1.30 - 1.52, p<0.001), greater need for closure (RR=1.19, 95% CI: 1.06 - 1.34, p=0.003), and greater risk tolerance (RR=1.17, 95% CI: 1.08 - 1.26, p<0.001) were associated with an increased willingness to treat; while greater need for cognition (RR: 0.85, 95% CI: 0.75 - 0.96, p=0.010) and greater research engagement (RR=0.91, 95% CI: 0.88 - 0.95, p<.0001) were associated with decreased willingness to treat. In phase two, most physicians updated their beliefs after publication of trial data about antimalarial agents and corticosteroids. Physicians with greater evidence skepticism more likely to persist in their beliefs. CONCLUSIONS: Psychological traits associated with clinical decisions in the setting of uncertain evidence may provide insight into strategies to better align clinical practice with published evidence.","Levin, Joel M; Davis, Billie S; Bukowski, Leigh A; Kahn, Jeremy M",Ann.

On March 2020 tocilizumab - an anti-IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibody - was suggested as immunomodulatory treatment in severe COVID-19 because hyperinflammatory syndrome occurs in many patients similarly to the cytokine release syndrome that develops after CAR-T cell therapy. In our retrospective observational study, 20 severe COVID-19 patients were treated with tocilizumab in addition to standard-of-care therapy (SOC) and compared with 13 COVID-19 patients receiving only SOC. Clinical respiratory status, inflammatory markers and vascular radiologic score improved after one week from tocilizumab administration. On the contrary these parameters were stable or worsened in patients receiving only SOC. Despite major study limitations, improvement of alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient as well as vascular radiologic score after one week may account for improved pulmonary vascular perfusion and could explain the more rapid recovery of COVID-19 patients receiving tocilizumab compared to controls.","Salvati, Lorenzo; Occhipinti, Mariaelena; Gori, Leonardo; Ciani, Luca; Mazzoni, Alessio; Maggi, Laura; Capone, Manuela; Parronchi, Paola; Liotta, Francesco; Miele, Vittorio; Annunziato, Francesco; Lavorini, Federico; Cosmi, Lorenzo",Immunol Lett,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33161002/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165247820304053; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.imlet.2020.10.009; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165247820304053?v=s5,254
631763,Factors influencing the readiness to tackle the burden of ischaemic heart disease in India: a systematic review protocol,2021-08-19,"Fatty acylation is a widespread form of protein modification that occurs on specific intracellular and secreted proteins. Beyond increasing hydrophobicity and the affinity of the modified protein for lipid bilayers, covalent attachment of a fatty acid exerts effects on protein localization, inter- and intramolecular interactions and signal transduction. As such, research into protein fatty acylation has been embraced by an extensive community of biologists. This special issue highlights advances at the forefront of the field, by focusing on two families of enzymes that catalyse post-translational protein fatty acylation, zDHHC palmitoyl acyltransferases and membrane-bound O-acyl transferases, and signalling pathways regulated by their fatty acylated protein substrates. The collected contributions catalogue the tremendous progress that has been made in enzyme and substrate identification. In addition, articles in this special issue provide insights into the pivotal functions of fatty acylated proteins in immune cell, insulin and EGF receptor-mediated signalling pathways. As selective inhibitors of protein fatty acyltransferases are generated, the future holds great promise for therapeutic targeting of fatty acyltransferases that play key roles in human disease.","Resh, Marilyn D.",Open biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34520700/; https://doi.org/10.1098/rsob.210228,254
632614,Timing of onset of symptom for COVID-19 from publicly reported confirmed cases in Uganda,2021-02-15,"OBJECTIVES: To describe a human metapneumovirus (hMPV) outbreak occurring in a nursing home for older adults and to identify the risk factors associated with the clinical infection. DESIGN: A retrospective, case-controlled study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A French nursing home for older adults between December 27, 2014 and January 20, 2015. Probable cases were residents presenting at least 1 respiratory symptom or 1 constitutional symptom. Confirmed cases identified in the same way as probable cases but with a positive RT-PCR test for hMPV. Controls were residents with no symptoms of respiratory infection. MEASURES: Identification of hMPV was realized on nasal swab samples by RT-PCR. RESULTS: Seventy-eight older people were resident at the time of the outbreak. Three of the 4 tested were positive for hMPV by RT-PCR and negative for 13 other viruses or bacteria. All probable infected residents presented cough; other symptoms were scarcer. An inflammatory response was present, with median C-reactive protein at 50 mg/L. The median duration of the illness was 7 days. The rate of infection among residents was high (51%), with 5 hospitalizations (12.5%) and 1 death (2.5%). In multivariate analysis, vaccination against influenza virus appeared to emerge as associated with a probable hMPV infection, but this might be an artifact, as the proportion of unvaccinated residents was low (15%). A clear infected population profile was hard to define, although limited autonomy and low ADL score may play a role. Basic hygiene precautions were reinforced, but droplet precautions seemed difficult to apply rigorously to this population. CONCLUSIONS/IMPLICATIONS: Clinical and biological presentations were nonspecific. The rate of infection was high, highlighting the need for the rapid introduction of strict precautions to contain the infection.","Seynaeve, Damien; Augusseau-Rivière, Brigitte; Couturier, Pascal; Morel-Baccard, Christine; Landelle, Caroline; Bosson, Jean-Luc; Gavazzi, Gaëtan; Mallaret, Marie-Reine",J Am Med Dir Assoc,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jamda.2019.03.015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31101588/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1525861019303020; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1525861019303020,254

This study aimed to explore the public perception of the MCO implementation and people’s experiences during this period. The study employed qualitative explorative in-depth interviews conducted with 23 Malaysian adults from various demographic backgrounds. Thematic analysis was performed using NVivo 12. Three main themes were identified: a period of information surge, heterogeneous emotional response, and attempts to adapt. During the MCO, the participants obtained information from multiple platforms. They suggested the need for clear and repeated instructions to avoid confusion and misinformation. They also acknowledged the importance of the MCO in breaking the chain of transmission and safeguarding high-risk groups; however, they also expressed that stricter enforcement from the authorities was warranted. The changes in the participants’ work–life routines, lack of physical interaction, and uncertainty about their health and the economy due to the MCO negatively impacted their psychological states. Despite these challenges, the participants attempted to adapt to life under the MCO in different ways. The findings imply that during a crisis, the public tends to seek clear and reliable information, experience emotional turmoil, and adapt to changes. The MCO implementation can be improved through an effective communication strategy and efforts to battle misinformation.","Tay, Yea Lu; Abdullah, Zalilah; Chelladorai, Kalvina; Low, Lee Lan; Tong, Seng Fah",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34444527/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18168778,254
635446,CEdRIC: Strategy for Patient Education During COVID-19 Triage,2020-10-06,"The disease COVID-19 has caused heavy socio-economic burden and there is immediate need to control it. The disease is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus. The viral entry into human cell depends on the attachment of spike (S) protein via its receptor binding domain (RBD) to human cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2). Thus, blocking the virus attachment to hACE2 could serve as potential therapeutics for viral infection. We have designed a peptide inhibitor (ΔABP-α2) targeting the RBD of S protein using in-silico approach. Docking studies and computed affinities suggested that peptide inhibitor binds at the RBD with ∼95-fold higher affinity than hACE2. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation confirms the stable binding of inhibitor to hACE2. Immunoinformatics studies suggest non-immunogenic and non-toxic nature of peptide. Thus, the proposed peptide could serve as potential blocker for viral attachment. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Mass spectrometry provided site-specific compositions of densely distributed high-mannose and complex-type N-glycans that account for 1/4 of the total molecular mass; most of the N-glycans could be visualized by cryo-EM. Specifically, the N-glycans that wedge between 2 galectin-like domains within the S1 subunit of FIPV S protein result in a unique propeller-like conformation, underscoring the importance of glycosylation in maintaining protein structures. The cleavage site within the S2 subunit responsible for activation also showed distinct structural features and glycosylation.

Herein, we characterized mouse-specific T cell responses in nonallergic laboratory animal-care workers before and after reexposure to mice. PBMCs were collected and stimulated with developed peptide pools identified from high-molecular-weight fractions of mouse allergen extracts. Sizable CD4 T cell responses were noted and were temporarily decreased in most subjects upon reexposure, with the magnitude of decrease positively correlated with time of reexposure but not the duration of the break. Interestingly, the suppression was specific to mouse allergens without affecting responses of bystander antigens. Further, PBMC fractioning studies illustrated that the modulation is unlikely from T cells, while B cell depletion and exchange reversed the suppression of responses, suggesting that B cells may be the key modulators. Increased levels of regulatory cytokines (IL-10 and TGF-β1) in the cell culture supernatant and plasma mouse-specific IgG4 were also observed after reexposure, consistent with B cell–mediated modulation mechanisms. Overall, these results suggest that nonallergic status is achieved by an active, time-related, allergen-specific, B cell-dependent regulatory process upon reexposure, the mechanisms of which should be detailed by further molecular studies.","Yu, Esther Dawen; Westernberg, Luise; Grifoni, Alba; Frazier, April; Sutherland, Aaron; Wang, Eric; Peters, Bjoern; da Silva Antunes, Ricardo; Sette, Alessandro",JCI insight,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33616085/; https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.145199,254

RESULTS: The mean age of the participants was 25 years. Only 28.74% of the house officers were categorized as having a good preparedness, while 85.83% of them have a good PPE attitude. The preparedness and willingness were significantly associated with the overall worry related to the pandemic (P value = 0.012).

This study investigated the potential risk factors associated with COVID-19 mortality in the continental United States. We collected death cases of COVID-19 from 3108 counties from 23 January 2020 to 31 May 2020. Twelve variables, including demographic (the population density, percentage of 65 years and over, percentage of non-Hispanic White, percentage of Hispanic, percentage of non-Hispanic Black, and percentage of Asian individuals), air toxins (PM2.5), climate (precipitation, humidity, temperature), behavior and comorbidity (smoking rate, cardiovascular death rate) were gathered and considered as potential risk factors. Based on four geographical detectors (risk detector, factor detector, ecological detector, and interaction detector) provided by the novel Geographical Detector technique, we assessed the spatial risk patterns of COVID-19 mortality and identified the effects of these factors. This study found that population density and percentage of non-Hispanic Black individuals were the two most important factors responsible for the COVID-19 mortality rate. Additionally, the interactive effects between any pairs of factors were even more significant than their individual effects. Most existing research examined the roles of risk factors independently, as traditional models are usually unable to account for the interaction effects between different factors. Based on the Geographical Detector technique, this study’s findings showed that causes of COVID-19 mortality were complex. The joint influence of two factors was more substantial than the effects of two separate factors. As the COVID-19 epidemic status is still severe, the results of this study are supposed to be beneficial for providing instructions and recommendations for the government on epidemic risk responses to COVID-19.","Yue, Han; Hu, Tao",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18136832; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34202168/,254

Regions that were able to contain the disease early have seen fewer deaths and lower economic losses. Some developing countries initially imposed drastic, costly measures, perhaps motivated by political economy.

This complication seems to develop after the infection rather than during the acute phase of COVID-19. The clinical features are similar to a well-known inflammatory syndrome in children, Kawasaki disease, and it can lead to collapse and multiple organ failure requiring intensive care. The COVID-19-associated multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children and adolescents is referred to mutually as pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally linked with SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS) or multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) correlated with COVID-19, and here, it is referred to as MIS-C. Case Presentation. This report describes a nine-month-old Asian infant presented with a two-week history of fever with nonspecific signs of viral illness and erythematous rash. The clinical and biochemical findings were compatible with complicated typical Kawasaki disease (KD). The infant fulfilled the World Health Organization criteria for MIS-C and was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin and anticoagulation, which he responded well to. He was discharged home in good condition after almost 3 weeks of treatment. CONCLUSION: This case highlights a rare but new phenomenon attributed to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. We report the first case report of MIS-C in the United Arab Emirates and Arab region. Among KD's complications, massive aneurysm with thrombosis is rare and usually will have deleterious results if not diagnosed and managed promptly.","Ghatasheh, Ghassan; Al Dhanhani, Huda; Goyal, Ashutosh; Noureddin, Muhammad Bassel; Al Awaad, Doaa; Peerwani, Ziad",Case Rep Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/8872412; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33532103/,254

The approach ties public health alerts into the diagnostic process and allows clinicians to more easily determine when an observed medical condition may be related to a more widespread disease outbreak. A prototype Alert Knowledge Repository (AKR) service using this approach was demonstrated within the Health Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS) and the Public Health Information Network (PHIN) interoperability showcases in April and September 2009, respectively.","Lombardo, Joseph S; Garrett, Nedra; Loschen, Wayne; Seagraves, Richard; Nichols, Barbara; Babin, Steven",Online J Public Health Inform,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23569573/; https://doi.org/10.5210/ojphi.v1i1.2750,254
641670,Some Lessons Learned About Diabetes and COVID-19 During the Early Stage of the Epidemic in Norway,2020-05-26,"Oncological care was largely derailed due to the reprioritisation of health care services to handle the initial surge of COVID-19 patients adequately. Cancer screening programmes were no exception in this reprioritisation. They were temporarily halted in the Netherlands (1) to alleviate the pressure on health care services overwhelmed by the upsurge of COVID-19 patients, (2) to reallocate staff and personal protective equipment to support critical COVID-19 care, and (3) to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Utilising data from the Netherlands Cancer Registry on provisional cancer diagnoses between 6 January 2020 and 4 October 2020, we assessed the impact of the temporary halt of national population screening programmes on the diagnosis of breast and colorectal cancer in the Netherlands. A dynamic harmonic regression model with ARIMA error components was applied to assess the observed versus expected number of cancer diagnoses per calendar week. Fewer diagnoses of breast and colorectal cancer were objectified amid the early stages of the initial COVID-19 outbreak in the Netherlands. This effect was most pronounced among the age groups eligible for cancer screening programmes, especially in breast cancer (age group 50–74 years). Encouragingly enough, the observed number of diagnoses ultimately reached and virtually remained at the level of the expected values. This finding, which emerged earlier in age groups not invited for cancer screening programmes, comes on account of the decreased demand for critical COVID-19 care since early April 2020, which, in turn, paved the way forward to resume screening programmes and a broad range of non-critical health care services, albeit with limited operating and workforce capacity. Collectively, transient changes in health-seeking behaviour, referral practices, and cancer screening programmes amid the early stages of the initial COVID-19 epidemic in the Netherlands conjointly acted as an accelerant for fewer breast and colorectal cancer diagnoses in age groups eligible for cancer screening programmes. Forthcoming research is warranted to assess whether the decreased diagnostic scrutiny of cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in stage migration and altered clinical management, as well as poorer outcomes.","Dinmohamed, Avinash G.; Cellamare, Matteo; Visser, Otto; de Munck, Linda; Elferink, Marloes A.

643248,"Clinical presentations and management of COVID-19 infected children seen in a district health facility in Kambia, northern Sierra Leone",2020-10-27,"Spreading dynamics and complex contagion processes on networks are important mechanisms underlying the emergence of critical transitions, tipping points and other non-linear phenomena in complex human and natural systems. Increasing amounts of temporal network data are now becoming available to study such spreading processes of behaviours, opinions, ideas, diseases and innovations to test hypotheses regarding their specific properties. To this end, we here present a methodology based on dose–response functions and hypothesis testing using surrogate data models that randomise most aspects of the empirical data while conserving certain structures relevant to contagion, group or homophily dynamics. We demonstrate this methodology for synthetic temporal network data of spreading processes generated by the adaptive voter model. Furthermore, we apply it to empirical temporal network data from the Copenhagen Networks Study. This data set provides a physically-close-contact network between several hundreds of university students participating in the study over the course of 3 months. We study the potential spreading dynamics of the health-related behaviour “regularly going to the fitness studio” on this network. Based on a hierarchy of surrogate data models, we find that our method neither provides significant evidence for an influence of a dose–response-type network spreading process in this data set, nor significant evidence for homophily. The empirical dynamics in exercise behaviour are likely better described by individual features such as the disposition towards the behaviour, and the persistence to maintain it, as well as external influences affecting the whole group, and the non-trivial network structure. The proposed methodology is generic and promising also for applications to other temporal network data sets and traits of interest.","Donges, Jonathan F.; Lochner, Jakob H.; Kitzmann, Niklas H.; Heitzig, Jobst; Lehmann, Sune; Wiedermann, Marc; Vollmer, Jürgen",Eur Phys J Spec Top,https://doi.org/10.1140/epjs/s11734-021-00279-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34611486/; https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.09496v2.pdf,254
643307,Self-reported Memory Problems 8 Months After COVID-19 Infection,2021-07-29,"Obesity-related type 2 diabetes represents one of the most difficult challenges for the healthcare system. This retrospective study aims to determine the efficacy, safety and durability of a very-low-calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD), compared to a standard low-calorie diet (LCD) on weight-loss, glycemic management, eating behavior and quality of life in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and obesity. Thirty patients with obesity and T2DM, aged between 35 and 75 years, who met the inclusion criteria and accepted to adhere to a VLCKD or a LCD nutritional program, were consecutively selected from our electronic database. Fifteen patients followed a structured VLCKD protocol, fifteen followed a classical LCD. At the beginning of the nutritional protocol, all patients were asked to stop any antidiabetic medications, with the exception of metformin. Data were collected at baseline and after 3 (T1) and 12 (T2) months. At T1 and T2, BMI was significantly reduced in the VLCKD group (p < 0.001), whereas it remained substantially unchanged in the LCD group. HbA1c was significantly reduced in the VLCKD group (p = 0.002), whereas a slight, although not significant, decrease was observed in the LCD group. Quality of life and eating behavior scores were improved in the VLCKD group, whereas no significant changes were reported in the LCD group, both at T1 and T2. At the end of the study, in the VLCKD group 26.6% of patients had stopped all antidiabetic medications, and 73.3% were taking only metformin, whereas 46.6% of LCD patients had to increase antidiabetic medications. The study confirms a valuable therapeutic effect of VLCKD in the long-term management of obesity and T2DM and its potential contribution to remission of the disease.","Moriconi, Eleonora; Camajani, Elisabetta; Fabbri, Andrea; Lenzi, Andrea; Caprio, Massimiliano",Nutrients,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33652834/; https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13030758,254
643606,Response to “Changes in traumatic mechanisms of injury in Southern California related to COVID-19: Penetrating trauma as a second pandemic”,2021-04-02,"The outbreak of COVID-19 has remained uncontained with urgent need for robust therapeutics. Males are more susceptible than females, and more often to develop into severe cases with higher mortality. This predisposition is potentially linked to higher prevalence of cigarette smoking. Nonetheless, we found for the first time that cigarette smoking extract (CSE) had no effect on angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) expression in endothelial cells. The otherwise observed worse outcomes in smokers is likely linked to baseline respiratory diseases associated with chronic smoking. Instead, we hypothesized that estrogen mediated protection might underlie less severe disease in females. Of note, endothelial inflammation and barrier dysfunction are major mediators of disease progression, and development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi-organ failure in patients with COVID-19. Therefore, we investigated the protective effects of estrogen on endothelial cells against oxidative stress induced by interleukin-6 (IL-6) and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S protein). Indeed, 17β-estradiol completely reversed IL-6 and S protein-induced selective activation of NADPH oxidase isoform 2 (NOX2), reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, ACE2 upregulation and induction of pro-inflammatory gene monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) in endothelial cells to effectively attenuate endothelial cell dysfunction. Of note, co-treatment with CSE had no additional effects on S protein stimulated endothelial oxidative stress, again indicating that current smoking status is likely unrelated to more severe disease in chronic smokers. These data indicate that estrogen may serve as a novel therapy for patients with COVID-19 via inhibition of initial viral responses and attenuation of cytokine storm induced endothelial dysfunction, to substantially alleviate severity of the disease and mortality, especially in men. Short-term application of estrogen may therefore be readily used in the clinical management of COVID-19 as a robust therapeutic option.","Youn, Ji Youn; Zhang, Yixuan; Wu, Yusi; Cannesson, Maxime; Cai, Hua",Redox Biol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2213231721002585; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.redox.2021.102099; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213231721002585?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34509916/,254

An assessment framework and country applications,2021-04-14,"Background: The long-term effects of COVID-19 remain largely unclear. This study aims to investigate post-acute health consequences and mortality one year after hospital discharge. Methods: All surviving adult patients who were discharged after hospital admission due to acute COVID-19 in the first wave of the pandemic underwent a comprehensive interview. Functional assessment was performed in patients aged over 65. Clinical and hospital records were reviewed and mortality causes assessed. Results: A total of 587 patients with COVID-19 were discharged from hospital, including 266 after hospital admission and 321 from the emergency room. Mortality within the following year occurred in 34/266 (12.8%) and 10/321 (3.1%), respectively, due to causes directly or possibly related to COVID-19 in 20.5% and 25% of patients. Post-COVID-19 syndrome was assessed in 543 patients at one year from discharge. Any clinical complaint was reported by 90.1% of patients who needed hospitalization and 80.4% of those discharged from the emergency room (p = 0.002), with breathlessness (41.6%), tiredness (35.4%), ageusia (30.2%), and anosmia (26.3%) being the most common complaints. Ongoing symptoms attributed to COVID-19 were reported by 66.8% and 49.5% of patients, respectively (p < 0.001). Newly developed COPD, asthma, diabetes, heart failure, and arthritis—as well as worsening of preexisting comorbidities—were found.

In December 2019, a new infectious respiratory disease emerged in Wuhan, Hubei province, China and was named by the World Health Organization as COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019). A new class of corona virus, known as SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) has been found to be responsible for occurrence of this disease. As far as the history of human civilization is concerned there are instances of severe outbreaks of diseases caused by a number of viruses. According to the report of the World Health Organization (WHO as of April 18 2020), the current outbreak of COVID-19, has affected over 2164111 people and killed more than 146,198 people in more than 200 countries throughout the world. Till now there is no report of any clinically approved antiviral drugs or vaccines that are effective against COVID-19. It has rapidly spread around the world, posing enormous health, economic, environmental and social challenges to the entire human population. The coronavirus outbreak is severely disrupting the global economy. Almost all the nations are struggling to slow down the transmission of the disease by testing & treating patients, quarantining suspected persons through contact tracing, restricting large gatherings, maintaining complete or partial lock down etc. This paper describes the impact of COVID-19 on society and global environment, and the possible ways in which the disease can be controlled has also been discussed therein.","Chakraborty, Indranil; Maity, Prasenjit",Science of The Total Environment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138882; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720323998; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32335410/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969720323998,254

OBJECTIVE: To discover how physical activity and lifestyle affect the epidemic as well as the disease severity and prognosis of COVID-19 patients. METHODS: This multicenter, retrospective cohort study included 203 adults infected with COVID-19 and 228 uninfected adults in three Chinese provinces, with 164 (80.7%) of the infected participants and 188 (82.5%) of the uninfected participants answering a doctor-administered telephone questionnaire on lifestyle. The binary logistic regression model and the ordinal logit model were used to observe relevance. RESULTS: Comparing sick and non-sick patients, we found that irregular exercise (P=0.004), sedentary lifestyle (P=0.010), and overexertion (P<0.001) may be associated with the susceptibility to COVID-19. In symptomatic patients, using the recommended status as a reference, risk of severe infection increased with decreased sleep status, being 6.729 (95% CI=2.138–21.181) times higher for potentially appropriate sleep (P=0.001) and peaking at 8.612 (95% CI=1.913–38.760) times higher for lack of sleep (P=0.005). Reduction in average daily sleep time significantly increased the likely severity (P=0.002). DISCUSSION: Through further examination of damage of external lung organs, we found that lack of sleep affected not only disease severity but also prognosis.

Les efforts internationaux de développement et d’approbation de plusieurs vaccins ont conduit au démarrage des campagnes de vaccination moins d’un an après l’émergence de cette pandémie. Les vaccins les plus efficaces montrent une efficacité>90 % et un excellent profil de tolérance. Les patients atteints d’un cancer actif présentent un risque accru de forme sévère de COVID-19 et devraient être par conséquence une population cible pour la vaccination. L’objectif de ce travail est de développer et de valider un nomogramme afin de prédire l’acceptabilité de la vaccination contre le SARS-CoV-2 chez des patients atteints de cancer. Méthodes Une enquête de cohorte a été menée dans quatre centres de cancérologie des Alpes-Maritimes entre novembre et décembre 2020. Les patients inclus étaient âgés de plus de 18 ans et traités pour un cancer par chimiothérapie ou radiothérapie ; sous hormonothérapie, ou étaient en surveillance de leur cancer. Un auto-questionnaire anonyme sur les déterminants de la future vaccination anti-COVID-19 a été administré à chaque patient. La cohorte a été séparée en deux cohortes distinctes : une cohorte d’apprentissage pour développer le modèle et une cohorte pour le valider. Les variables statistiquement significatives lors de l’analyse univariée (p <0,05) ont été introduites dans un modèle de régression logistique en suivant une procédure de sélection des variables de type pas à pas descendant utilisant le critère AIC. À partir du modèle multivarié final, un nomogramme a été développé afin de prédire l’acceptabilité des patients vis-à-vis de la vaccination contre le SARS-CoV-2. Toutes les analyses ont été réalisées à l’aide du logiciel R et du package DynNom pour la représentation graphique du nomogramme. Résultats Parmi les 1244 questionnaires administrés, 999 questionnaires ont été analysés (80,3 %). La population comprenait 56,1 % de femmes et l’âge médian était de 67 ans (extrêmes : 18–97). Parmi ces patients, 47 % étaient sous traitement actif (chimiothérapie, immunothérapie, radiothérapie), 40 % étaient sous surveillance et 13 % étaient sous hormonothérapie. La majorité avait reçu un vaccin contre la grippe en 2020 (54,3 %) ou les années précédentes (52,2 %). Une faible proportion des patients a affirmé avoir contracté la COVID-19 (2,8 %) et plus de 50 % des patients ont déclaré l’intention de vouloir se faire vacciner. Le sexe, l’âge et l’antécédent de vaccination contre la grippe ont été identifiés comme des facteurs indépendants significatifs prédictifs de la volonté de se faire vacciner contre le SARS-CoV-2 et ont été utilisés dans la construction du nomogramme.

650075,An overview of the COVID‐19 complications in paediatric population: A pandemic dilemma,2021-06-22,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic poses the greatest global public health challenge in a century. Neutralizing antibody is a correlate of protection and data on kinetics of virus neutralizing antibody responses are needed. We tested 293 sera from an observational cohort of 195 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections collected from 0 to 209 days after onset of symptoms. Of 115 sera collected ≥61 days after onset of illness tested using plaque reduction neutralization (PRNT) assays, 99.1% remained seropositive for both 90% (PRNT(90)) and 50% (PRNT(50)) neutralization endpoints. We estimate that it takes at least 372, 416 and 133 days for PRNT(50) titres to drop to the detection limit of a titre of 1:10 for severe, mild and asymptomatic patients, respectively. At day 90 after onset of symptoms (or initial RT-PCR detection in asymptomatic infections), it took 69, 87 and 31 days for PRNT(50) antibody titres to decrease by half (T(1/2)) in severe, mild and asymptomatic infections, respectively. Patients with severe disease had higher peak PRNT(90) and PRNT(50) antibody titres than patients with mild or asymptomatic infections. Age did not appear to compromise antibody responses, even after accounting for severity. We conclude that SARS-CoV-2 infection elicits robust neutralizing antibody titres in most individuals.","Lau, Eric H. Y.; Tsang, Owen T. Y.; Hui, David S. C.; Kwan, Mike Y.

METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed of all SARS-CoV-2 test results within the UCLA Health System between March 9th and April 29th, 2020. All patients with repeat test results were identified and those with discordant results were reviewed. RESULTS: Between March 9th and April 29th there were 10,165 SARS-CoV-2 test results, of which 630 (6.2%) were positive. Among the 904 patients with repeat test results, 808 (89.4%) were initially negative and 96 (10.6%) were initially positive. Among the 808 patients with an initial negative test, 15 (1.9%) subsequently tested positive. Eleven cases with an initial negative SARS-CoV-2 test and without a known prior positive SARS-CoV-2 test were reviewed; 6 were employed as healthcare workers and 10 were positive on the second test. CONCLUSIONS: We found a low diagnostic yield of repeat testing for SARS-CoV-2 in our health system. Repeat testing might prove useful in certain clinical scenarios, such as in healthcare workers, when symptoms develop after a negative test, and in hospitalized patients with a high clinical suspicion for COVID-19.","Adamson, Paul C.; Goodman-Meza, David; Vijayan, Tara; Yang, Shangxin; Garner, Omai B.",Int J Infect Dis,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971220306780; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32835787/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.08.048; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971220306780?v=s5,254

Who are we missing?,2020-05-04,"Since the emergence of the novel coronavirus, named COVID-19, researchers are looking for a treatment to stop the devastating pandemic. During these efforts, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), the potential next generation of therapeutic methods with wide application for diseases, have successfully controlled cytokine storm following the virus infection. However, the use of MSCs has been limited due to the ethical issues, immunogenicity, and genetic modifications. Therefore, exosomes were introduced as a suitable substitute for the MSCs. In the case of COVID-19 treatment, both MSCs and exosomes exert their beneficial effect mainly through the management of the cytokine storm. This study provided the underlying mechanisms for the effect of exosomes on COVID-19 treatment and presented several preclinical and clinical studies of exosomes for COVID-19 treatment.","Kiaie, Nasim; Ghanavati, Seyedeh Parvin Mousavi; Miremadi, Sara Sadat; Hadipour, Azam; Aghdam, Rouhollah Mehdinavaz",Int J Stem Cells,https://doi.org/10.15283/ijsc20182; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34158414/,254

Here, we present a structural snapshot of SARS-CoV-2 RTC as it transition towards cap structure synthesis. We determine the atomic cryo-EM structure of an extended RTC assembled by nsp7-nsp82-nsp12-nsp132-RNA and a single RNA binding protein nsp9. Nsp9 binds tightly to nsp12 (RdRp) NiRAN, allowing nsp9 N-terminus inserting into the catalytic center of nsp12 NiRAN, which then inhibits activity. We also show that nsp12 NiRAN possesses guanylyltransferase activity, catalyzing the formation of cap core structure (GpppA). The orientation of nsp13 that anchors the 5’ extension of template RNA shows a remarkable conformational shift, resulting in zinc finger 3 of its ZBD inserting into a minor groove of paired template-primer RNA. These results reason an intermediate state of RTC towards mRNA synthesis, pave a way to understand the RTC architecture, and provide a target for antiviral development.","Yan, Liming; Ge, Ji; Zheng, Litao; Zhang, Ying; Gao, Yan; Wang, Tao; Huang, Yucen; Yang, Yunxiang; Gao, Shan; Li, Mingyu; Liu, Zhenyu; Wang, Haofeng; Li, Yingjian; Chen, Yu; Guddat, Luke W.; Wang, Quan; Rao, Zihe; Lou, Zhiyong",Cell,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2020.11.016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33232691/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867420315336?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0092867420315336,254

The possibility of radar-based approaches for breathing and cardiac sensing was demonstrated a few decades ago. However, investigation regarding the robustness of radar-based vital-sign monitoring (VSM) is not available in the current radar literature. In this paper, we aim to close this gap by presenting an extensive experimental study of vital-sign radar approach. We consider diversity in test subjects, fitness levels, poses/postures, and, more importantly, random body movement (RBM) in the study. We discuss some new insights that lead to robust radar heart-rate (HR) measurements. A novel active motion cancellation signal-processing technique is introduced, exploiting dual ultra-wideband (UWB) radar system for motion-tolerant HR measurements. Additionally, we propose a spectral pruning routine to enhance HR estimation performance. We validate the proposed method theoretically and experimentally. Totally, we record and analyze about 3500 s of radar measurements from multiple human subjects.","Rong, Yu; Dutta, Arindam; Chiriyath, Alex; Bliss, Daniel W.",Sensors (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33806426/; https://doi.org/10.3390/s21051774,254

Le Haut Conseil de santé publique français a recommandé l’utilisation du lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/RTV) qui a montré une efficacité in vitro contre ce virus. La charge virale atteignant son maximum dans la première semaine de l’infection, l’efficacité de ce traitement est probablement optimale s’il est administré pour des formes de pneumopathies précoces survenant au cours de cette première semaine. Matériels et méthodes Nous avons conduit une étude rétrospective à partir des données du dossier patient d’un hôpital de 350 lits, comparant 2 prises en charge des pneumopathies précoces à SARS-CoV-2 : soins de support (SDS) seuls versus SDS associés à un traitement par LPV/RTV (400mg/100mg) 2 fois par jour, à l’exclusion de tout autre traitement. Les patients âgés de 18 à 80 ans, hospitalisés pour pneumopathie précoce à SARS-CoV-2 avec PCR positive, en service médecine hors unité de soins intensifs (USI), ayant reçu au moins 48h de traitement par LPV/RTV débuté dans les 10jours à partir du début des symptômes ont été inclus dans l’analyse. Le critère de jugement principal était le transfert en USI. Les critères de jugement secondaires étaient : la mortalité hospitalière, la mortalité à j7, la survenue d’un syndrome de détresse respiratoire aigu, et la durée totale d’hospitalisation. Résultats Entre le 2 mars et le 12 avril 2020, 59 patients parmi les 225 (26 %) hospitalisés pour infection à SARS-CoV-2 étaient éligibles pour l’analyse. Vingt (34 %) avaient reçu un traitement par LPV/RTV+SDS et 39 (66 %) avaient reçu des SDS seuls. Le délai médian entre le début des symptômes et l’hospitalisation était de 4jours (IQR [3–6]) et la durée médiane de traitement par LPV/RTV était de 6jours, (IQR [5–7]). Les 2 groupes étaient comparables en termes de comorbidité (âge [médiane 56 ans, IQR (46–65)], sexe, IMC, diabète, insuffisance cardiaque et respiratoire). Dix patients ont été transférés en USI : 3/29 (15 %) dans le groupe LPV/RTV+SDS et 7/39 (18 %) dans le groupe traitement par SDS seuls (p =0,37). La mortalité hospitalière était similaire (2 patients dans le groupe SDS seuls et aucun dans le groupe LPV/RTV+SDS, p =0,4). Nous n’avons pas retrouvé de différence pour les autres critères de jugement. Dans le modèle de régression logistique incluant le sexe, l’âge, et la prise de LPV/RTV, aucun facteur n’était associé de manière significative à une réduction du transfert en USI. Conclusion L’utilisation de LPV/RTV dans les pneumopathies précoces à SARS-CoV-2 n’a pas diminué significativement le taux de passage en USI ni la mortalité hospitalière. Nos résultats justifient cependant que la stratégie d’administration précoce d’une thérapie antivirale soit évaluée dans le cadre d’un essai clinique randomisé plus important.","Arias, P.; Chakvetadze, E.; Youboung, T.; Kopp, A.; Flateau, C.; Strazzula, A.; de Pontfarcy, A.; Jochmans, S.; Diamantis, S.",Médecine et Maladies Infectieuses,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0399077X20303504; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0399077X20303504,254

While there is a growing body of recommendations for healthcare professionals and the wider population to use facial protection in “enclosed spaces” where minimal distancing from other individuals is not possible, there is a dearth of clear guidelines for individuals undertaking exercise and sporting activity. The present viewpoint aims to propose recommendations for face coverings while exercising during the COVID-19 pandemic that consider physical distancing, the environment, the density of active cases associated with the specific sports activity, and the practical use of face coverings in order to reduce potential viral transmission. Recommendations are provided on the basis of very limited available evidence in conjunction with the extensive collective clinical experience of the authors and acknowledging the need to consider the likelihood of the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 in the general population. We recommend that face coverings should be used in any environment considered to be of a high or moderate transmission risk, where tolerated and after individual risk assessment. In addition, as national caseloads fluctuate, individual sporting bodies should consider up to date guidance on the use of face coverings during sport and exercise, alongside other preventative measures.","Shurlock, Jonathan; Muniz-Pardos, Borja; Tucker, Ross; Bachl, Norbert; Papadopoulou, Theodora; Holloway, Graham; Jones, Nigel; Bigard, Xavier; Vonbank, Karin; Niederseer, David; Meyer, Joachim; Nowak, Dennis; Debruyne, Andre; Zupet, Petra; Löllgen, Herbert; Steinacker, Juergen M.; Wolfarth, Bernd; Bilzon, James L.

This might lead to changes in the roles of the patient and health care professional and affect the partnership between them. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this qualitative study was to explore the partnership between patients and health care professionals and the roles of patients and professionals in hypertension management when using an interactive web-based system for self-management of hypertension via the patient’s own mobile phone. METHODS: Focus group interviews were conducted with 22 patients and 15 professionals participating in a randomized controlled trial in Sweden aimed at lowering blood pressure (BP) using an interactive web-based system via mobile phones. The interviews were audiorecorded and transcribed and analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Three themes were identified: the technology, the patient, and the professional. The technology enabled documentation of BP treatment, mainly for sharing knowledge between the patient and the professional. The patients gained increased knowledge of BP values and their relation to daily activities and treatment. They were able to narrate about their BP treatment and take a greater responsibility, inspired by new insights and motivation for lifestyle changes. Based on the patient’s understanding of hypertension, professionals could use the system as an educational tool and some found new ways of communicating BP treatment with patients. Some reservations were raised about using the system, that it might be too time-consuming to function in clinical practice and that too much measuring could result in stress for the patient and an increased workload for the professionals. In addition, not all professionals and patients had adopted the instructions regarding the use of the system, resulting in less realization of its potential. CONCLUSIONS: The use of the system led to the patients taking on a more active role in their BP treatment, becoming more of an expert of their BP. When using the system as intended, the professionals experienced it as a useful resource for communication regarding BP and lifestyle. Patients and professionals described a consultation on more equal grounds. The use of technology in hypertension management can promote a constructive and person-centered partnership between patient and professional. However, implementation of a new way of working should bring benefits and not be considered a burden for the professionals. To establish a successful partnership, both the patient and the professional need to be motivated toward a new way of working.

654556,Delirium in COVID-19: epidemiology and clinical correlations in a large group of patients admitted to an academic hospital,2020-09-18,"BACKGROUND Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel coronavirus strain disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The disease is highly transmissible and severe disease including viral sepsis has been reported in up to 16% of hospitalized cases. The admission characteristics associated with increased odds of hospital mortality among confirmed cases of COVID-19 include severe hypoxia, low platelet count, elevated bilirubin, hypoalbuminemia and reduced glomerular filtration rate. These symptoms correlate highly with severe sepsis cases. The diseases also share similar co-morbidity risks including dementia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, hypertension and chronic renal failure. Sepsis has been observed in up to 59% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. It is highly desirable to identify risk factors and novel therapy/drug repurposing avenues for late-stage severe COVID-19 patients. This would enable better protection of at-risk populations and clinical stratification of COVID-19 patients according to their risk for developing life threatening disease. METHODS As there is currently insufficient data available for confirmed COVID-19 patients correlating their genomic profile, disease severity and outcome, co-morbidities and treatments as well as epidemiological risk factors (such as ethnicity, blood group, smoking, BMI etc.), a direct study of the impact of host genomics on disease severity and outcomes is not yet possible. We therefore ran a study on the UK Biobank sepsis cohort as a surrogate to identify sepsis associated signatures and genes, and correlated these with COVID-19 patients. Sepsis is itself a life-threatening inflammatory health condition with a mortality rate of approximately 20%. Like the initial studies for COVID-19 patients, standard genome wide association studies (GWAS) have previously failed to identify more than a handful of genetic variants that predispose individuals to developing sepsis. RESULTS We used a combinatorial association approach to analyze a sepsis population derived from UK Biobank. We identified 70 sepsis risk-associated genes, which provide insights into the disease mechanisms underlying sepsis pathogenesis. Many of these targets can be grouped by common mechanisms of action such as endothelial cell dysfunction, PI3K/mTOR pathway signaling, immune response regulation, aberrant GABA and neurogenic signaling. CONCLUSION This study has identified 70 sepsis related genes, many of them for the first time, that can reasonably be considered to be potentially relevant to severe COVID-19 patients. We have further identified 59 drug repurposing candidates for 13 of these targets that can be used for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to increase the survival rate of patients who develop sepsis and potentially severe COVID-19.","Das, S.; Taylor, K.; Pearson, M.; Kozubek, J.; Pawlowski, M.; Jensen, C.

Medical staff participating in COVID-19 are facing enormous mental and psychological pressure. In the early stage of the outbreak, in order to control the epidemic, the COVID-19 designated hospital was established to receive suspected and confirmed patients. This study focused on the mental health status of medical staff in designated hospitals at the early stage of the epidemic. We aimed to provide better psychological assistance for medical staff in designated hospitals. Methods: This study was conducted by using symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90) through network survey from Feb.4 2020 to Feb.25 2020. The mental health of medical staff in the COVID-19 designated hospital and non-designated hospital in Sichuan Province was investigated. Furthermore, the two-way ANOVA was used to evaluate the impact of the designated hospital and the non-designated hospital and gender on the mental health status of medical staff under the epidemic effect. Results: A total of 948 valid questionnaires were collected. 252 medical staff in designated hospitals completed the questionnaire, including 46 males and 206 females. A total of 696 questionnaires were completed by non-designated hospitals, including 124 males and 572 females. The designated hospital and non-designated hospital were divided into two groups. The group main effects analysis was used to analyze 10 factors of SCL90 in the two groups. The results showed that all factors of SCL90 of medical staff in designated hospitals were higher than those in non-designated hospitals. It includes somatization, obsessive-compulsive, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, anxiety, hostile, phobic, paranoia and psychotic factors. There were interaction effects among the factors of SCL90. The results of post examination showed that there was no gender difference among medical staff in non-designated hospitals. Among the medical staff in designated hospitals, the score of male is higher than that of female. Compared with non-designated hospitals, there are significant differences in interpersonal sensitivity, somatization, anxiety, psychotic, paranoia and the total score of SCL-90 between designated hospitals and non-designated hospitals. There was no significant difference in SCL-90 score between designated hospitals and non-designated hospitals. Conclusions: In the early stage of the outbreak of covid-19, the mental health status of male medical staff in designated hospitals needs more attention, especially in their emotion, interpersonal relationship and physical symptoms.

It looks at available material and infrastructural resources and how they can be brought to bear in such incidents or situations. The aim was to gain an initial scientific overview of how ZMK can potentially contribute to the handling of a pandemia or mass casualty (MASCAL) situation in terms of available resources as well as their location within the hospital as a whole and their integration into the existing infrastructure. The study was conducted on the basis of a questionnaire consisting of 70 individual questions, which was sent to all universities in Germany that offer a course of study in dental medicine. The responses were then statistically evaluated. RESULTS: The study outlines the current status of ZMK and discusses what could be an important component of emergency medical care in the overall hospital context. CONCLUSION: The involvement of ZMK—with their own resources and existing infrastructural links to the hospital as a whole—could lead to faster and more effective patient treatment in the event of a pandemic or MASCAL situation.","Schiller, Marcus; Pilette, Marijatta; Rahlf, Björn; von See, Constantin; Gellrich, N.-C.",Bull Natl Res Cent,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33024405/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s42269-020-00427-4,254

METHOD: The Schlieren method with a single curved mirror was used in this study. Coughed air has a slightly higher temperature than ambient air, which generates a refractive index gradient. A curved mirror with a radius of curvature of 10 m and a diameter of 60 cm was used. The spread of the cough wavefront was investigated among five subjects wearing: (1) no mask; (2) a single surgical mask; (3) a double surgical mask; (4) a cloth mask; (5) a valveless N95 mask; and (6) a valved N95 mask. RESULTS: All mask types reduced the size of the contaminated region significantly. The percentage reduction in the cross-sectional area of the contaminated region for the same mask types on different subjects revealed by normalized data suggests that the fit of a mask plays an important role. CONCLUSIONS: No significant difference in the spread of coughed air was found between the use of a single surgical mask or a double surgical mask. Cloth masks may be effective, depending on the quality of the cloth. Valved N95 masks exclusively protect the user. The fit of a mask is an important factor to minimize the contaminated region.","Tanisali, Gokhan; Sozak, Ahmet; Bulut, Abdul Samet; Sander, Tolga Ziya; Dogan, Ozlem; Dağ, Çağdaş; Gönen, Mehmet; Can, Fusun; DeMirci, Hasan; Ergonul, Onder",Int J Infect Dis,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S120197122100518X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S120197122100518X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34147668/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2021.06.029,254

660593,COVID-19: challenges and the impact on care in clinical settings in Cameroon,2020-07-24,"The novel coronavirus, since its first outbreak in December, has, up till now, affected approximately 114,542 people across 115 countries. Many international agencies are devoting efforts to enhance the understanding of the evolving COVID-19 outbreak on an international level, its influences, and preparedness. At present, COVID-19 appears to affect individuals through person-to-person means, like other commonly found cold or influenza viruses. It is widely known and acknowledged that viruses causing influenza peak during cold temperatures and gradually subside in the warmer temperature, owing to their seasonality. Thus, COVID-19, due to its regular flu-like symptoms, is also expected to show similar seasonality and subside as the global temperatures rise in the northern hemisphere with the onset of spring. Despite these speculations, however, the systematic analysis in the global perspective of the relation between COVID-19 spread and meteorological parameters is unavailable. Here, by analyzing the region- and city-specific affected global data and corresponding meteorological parameters, we show that there is an optimum range of temperature and UV index strongly affecting the spread and survival of the virus, whereas precipitation, relative humidity, cloud cover, etc. have no effect on the virus. Unavailability of pharmaceutical interventions would require greater preparedness and alert for the effective control of COVID-19. Under these conditions, the information provided here could be very helpful for the global community struggling to fight this global crisis. It is, however, important to note that the information presented here clearly lacks any physiological evidences, which may merit further investigation. Thus, any attempt for management, implementation, and evaluation strategies responding to the crisis arising due to the COVID-19 outbreak must not consider the evaluation presented here as the foremost factor.","Gunthe, Sachin S.; Swain, Basudev; Patra, Satya S.; Amte, Aneesh",Z Gesundh Wiss,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32337151/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10389-020-01279-y,254
660735,Harm Reduction: A Research Agenda,2020-11-03,"Publisher Summary Disease processes of the central nervous system (CNS) accompanied by demyelination may be the result of a viral infection or the consequence of an immunopathological reaction directed against myelin. In acute viral infections, the infection of oligodendroglial cells, leading to cell destruction, may be the main mechanism for inducing this neuropathological lesion. In the case of a persistent virus infection in oligodendroglia cells, however, it is conceivable that functional impairment of oligodendroglia cells, or the induction of an immune reaction to the agent that may cross-react with brain antigens, could eventually cause demyelination. Therefore, pathogenic studies on subacute or chronic demyelinating encephalomyelitides in association with viral infections may provide information on the mechanisms involved in demyelination. In rats, depending on the biological property of the virus material used, the genetic background and immune response of the host, a subacute or late demyelinating encephalomyelitis can be induced, accompanied by primary demyelination. This provides a model for analysis of the virus and host factors interacting in the pathogenesis of these diseases.","Wege, Helmut; Watanabe, Rihito; Koga, Makoto; Meulen, Volker Ter",Progress in Brain Research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6320266/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0079612308638674; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079612308638674,254

As an effort to control the disease spread, the Indian government declared a nationwide lockdown on March 25th, 2020. As dental treatment was considered high risk in the spread of COVID-19, dentistry became one of the most vulnerable professions during this time. Dental professionals had to face job layoffs, salary cuts in professional colleges, closure of private clinics resulting in huge psychological, moral, and financial crises. Studies during the previous and present pandemics have shown mental issues among health care workers necessitating institutional reforms, along with early care and support. A balance in the work-life amongst professionals is the key to better efficiency and, was majorly affected during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown due to sudden unexpected changes. Hence this study was conducted to understand the changes they underwent both at home and professional front with a hypothesis that physical and mental health, activities, relationship status, and workplace influence the work-life balance. METHODS: A pre-validated questionnaire survey was done on dentists across India. Structural Equation Modelling and path analysis were applied to the data collected. RESULTS: The results of the study supported the hypothesis that factors like physical and mental health, activities, relationship status, and workplace influenced the work-life balance directly. A significant imbalance was seen amongst the female dentists. CONCLUSION: The present study proved the unpreparedness among dental professionals. Hence an evolutionary phase in every field with better working protocols, robust mental health support, and a focus on strategies to face future such emergencies is required.","Pai, Swathi; Patil, Vathsala; Kamath, Rajashree; Mahendra, Mansi; Singhal, Deepak Kumar; Bhat, Vishal",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34428247/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0256663,254

661409,COVID‐19 outbreak and pediatric diabetes: perceptions of health care professionals worldwide,2020-07-20,"Environmental monitoring in public spaces can be used to identify surfaces contaminated by persons with COVID-19 and inform appropriate infection mitigation responses. Research groups have reported detection of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on surfaces days or weeks after the virus has been deposited, making it difficult to estimate when an infected individual may have shed virus onto a SARS-CoV-2 positive surface, which in turn complicates the process of establishing effective quarantine measures. In this study, we determined that reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) detection of viral RNA from heat-inactivated particles experiences minimal decay over seven days of monitoring on eight out of nine surfaces tested. The properties of the studied surfaces result in RT-qPCR signatures that can be segregated into two material categories, rough and smooth, where smooth surfaces have a lower limit of detection. RT-qPCR signal intensity (average quantification cycle (Cq)) can be correlated to surface viral load using only one linear regression model per material category. The same experiment was performed with infectious viral particles on one surface from each category, with essentially identical results. The stability of RT-qPCR viral signal demonstrates the need to clean monitored surfaces after sampling to establish temporal resolution. Additionally, these findings can be used to minimize the number of materials and time points tested and allow for the use of heat-inactivated viral particles when optimizing environmental monitoring methods.","Salido, Rodolfo A.; Cantú, Victor J.; Clark, Alex E.; Leibel, Sandra L.; Foroughishafiei, Anahid; Saha, Anushka; Hakim, Abbas; Nouri, Alhakam; Lastrella, Alma L.; Castro-Martínez, Anelizze; Plascencia, Ashley; Kapadia, Bhavika; Xia, Bing; Ruiz, Christopher; Marotz, Clarisse A.; Maunder, Daniel; Lawrence, Elijah S.; Smoot, Elizabeth W.; Eisner, Emily; Crescini, Evelyn S.; Kohn, Laura; Vargas, Lizbeth Franco; Chacón, Marisol; Betty, Maryann; Machnicki, Michal; Wu, Min Yi; Baer, Nathan A.; Belda-Ferre, Pedro; Hoff, Peter De; Seaver, Phoebe; Ostrander, R.

661555,Does spatial proximity drive norovirus transmission during outbreaks in hospitals?,2013-07-12,"BACKGROUND: Following other countries, Israel passed the Vaccine Injury Compensation Law in 1989, which provides for compensation to vaccine recipients who had suffered injuries without proving negligence. In 2021, after deliberations between the ministries of health and of finance Covid-19 vaccines (administered from the beginning of the campaign on December 20, 2020 and up to December 21, 2022) were included within the compensation law. The current study aims to examine the objectives of Israel’s Vaccine Injury Compensation Law, at the time of its enactment, and to explore barriers to their fulfillment. These issues are especially relevant in light of the discussions held on the option for liability exemption which excludes the possibility of redress from the Covid-19 vaccine manufacturers in case of injury attributed to the vaccine, and considering the heavy burden of proof required in standard tort law. METHODS: The study employed a qualitative methodology which made use of both content analysis of relevant documents and in-depth interviews. RESULTS: In passing the Vaccine Injury Compensation Law, legislators sought to assist vaccine recipients who had suffered injuries by both lowering their burden of proof as well as establishing a short and efficient procedure for deliberating their claims. Furthermore, legislators believed that the assurance of compensation to vaccine recipients who had suffered injuries would help to encourage a high rate of vaccination compliance. An examination of the law’s implementation over time revealed that the aforementioned goals were not attained. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of the law since its enactment missed the opportunity to fulfill its original purposes to promote public health fundamental principles of fairness and solidarity. In addition, the adversarial proceedings as well as some of the law’s provisions have the potential to undermine public trust in the State’s willingness to grant compensation for injuries that are attributed to vaccines and thereby subvert the law’s pivotal objective of promoting trust and vaccine compliance. We suggest that allowing circumstantial evidence as to an association between vaccine and an injury, transitioning to administrative deliberation, making available to the public details of cases where compensation was awarded, as well as other possible emendations would help it better reflect the values of fairness and solidarity that underlying the law's purpose. These would also promote the level of trust in healthcare authorities which is essential to preserving high vaccine coverage.","Kamin-Friedman, Shelly; Davidovitch, Nadav",Isr J Health Policy Res,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13584-021-00490-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34517920/,254

We assessed whether sleep and self-reported burnout may be risk factors for COVID-19 among high-risk healthcare workers (HCWs). METHODS: From 17 July to 25 September 2020, a web-based survey was administered to HCWs in six countries (France, Germany, Italy, Spain, UK, USA) with a high frequency of workplace exposure. Participants provided information on demographics, sleep (number of sleep hours at night, daytime napping hours, sleep problems), burnout from work and COVID-19 exposures. We used multivariable linear and logistic regression models to evaluate the associations between sleep, burnout and COVID-19. RESULTS: Among 2884 exposed HCWs, there were 568 COVID-19 cases and 2316 controls. After adjusting for confounders, 1-hour longer sleep duration at night was associated with 12% lower odds of COVID-19 (p=0.003). Daytime napping hours was associated with 6% higher odds, but the association varied by countries, with a non-significant inverse association in Spain. Compared with having no sleep problems, having three sleep problems was associated with 88% greater odds of COVID-19. Reporting burnout ‘every day’ was associated with greater odds of COVID-19 (OR: 2.60, 95% CI 1.57 to 4.31, p trend across categories=0.001), longer duration (OR: 2.98, 95% CI 1.10 to 8.05, p trend=0.02) and severity (OR: 3.26, 95% CI 1.25 to 8.48, p trend=0.02) compared with reporting no burnout. These associations remained significant after adjusting for frequency of COVID-19 exposures. CONCLUSIONS: In six countries, longer sleep duration was associated with lower odds of COVID-19, but the association with daytime nap may not be consistent across countries. Greater sleep problems and high level of burnout were robustly associated with greater odds of COVID-19.

This study examined the inhibitory effect of food phytochemicals on the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 by determining a cleaved product after chromatographic separation. First, 37 phytochemicals, including glycosides and metabolites, were screened at 20 µM; epigallocatechin gallate, myricetin, theaflavin, herbacetin, piceatannol, myricitrin, and isothiocyanates inhibited the enzyme in varying degrees. The IC50 values were estimated from 0.4 to 33.3 µM against the 0.5-µM enzyme. The dose-dependent adduction of epigallocatechin gallate and myricetin was confirmed by quinone staining of protein blotted onto a membrane. The enzyme activity was decreased by increasing the concentration of the two phytochemicals, accompanied by increasing the respective adducted molecule estimated by intact mass spectrometry. Reduced glutathione canceled the formation of conjugate and the inhibitory effect of epigallocatechin gallate or myricetin on the enzyme, suggesting that the formation of the quinone moiety in the phytochemicals is critical for the inhibition. The covalent binding of epigallocatechin gallate or myricetin to the cysteine residue at the active site was confirmed by analyzing peptides from the chymotrypsin-digested main protease.","Kato, Yoji; Higashiyama, Akari; Takaoka, Emi; Nishikawa, Miyu; Ikushiro, Shinichi",,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2667137921000217; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667137921000217?v=s5,254

In this study an evaluation of the awareness of rare diseases, alongside related information and educational resources available for patients, their families and healthcare professionals, was conducted in 2018–2019 using an online survey and semi-structured interviews with rare disease collaborative groups (charities, voluntary and community groups) active across Northern Ireland (NI). METHODS: This study had 2 stages. Stage 1 was an online survey and stage 2 involved semi-structured interviews both with rare disease collaborative groups in Northern Ireland. The surveys and interviews were used to locate existing resources as well as identify gaps where the development of further resources would be appropriate. RESULTS: Ninety-nine rare disease collaborative groups engaged with the survey with 31 providing detailed answers. Resources such as information, communication, ‘registries’, online services, training and improvements to support services were queried. Excellent communication is an important factor in delivering good rare disease support. Training for health professionals was also highlighted as an essential element of improving support for those with a rare disease to ensure they approach people with these unique and challenging diseases in an appropriate way. Carers were mentioned several times throughout the study; it is often felt they are overlooked in rare disease research and more support should be in place for them. Current care/support for those with a rare disease was highlighted as inadequate. Nine semi-structured interviews were conducted with rare disease collaborative groups. Reoccurring themes included a need for more effective information and communication, training for health professionals, online presence, support for carers, and involvement in research. CONCLUSIONS: All rare disease collaborative groups agreed that current services for people living and working with a rare disease are not adequate. An important finding to consider in future research within the rare disease field is the inclusion of carers perceptions and experiences in studies. This research provides insight into the support available for rare diseases across Northern Ireland, highlights unmet needs, and suggests approaches to improve rare disease support.","McMullan, Julie; Crowe, Ashleen L.; Bailie, Caitlin; Moore, Kerry; McMullan, Lauren S.; Shamandi, Nahid; McAneney, Helen; McKnight, Amy Jayne",Orphanet J Rare Dis,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13023-020-01559-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33168042/,254

The manufacturing of finished prescription drugs for the American market is more equally split between domestic and foreign locations, but is increasingly foreign as well. The American reliance on non-domestic manufacturing of prescription drugs is important for stakeholders to appreciate, given current quality and pricing concerns and their potential susceptibility to interruptions in supply due to natural disasters, pandemics, and international trade negotiations.

OBJECTIVES: This review examined the efficacy of recent technology-based interventions on weight outcomes. METHODS: Seven databases were searched in April 2020 following PRISMA guidelines. Inclusion criteria were: participants aged 1–18 y, use of technology in a prevention/treatment intervention for overweight/obesity; weight outcome; randomized controlled trial (RCT); and published after January 2014. Random effects models with inverse variance weighting estimated pooled mean effect sizes separately for treatment and prevention interventions. Meta-regressions examined the effect of technology type (telemedicine or technology-based), technology purpose (stand-alone or adjunct), comparator (active or no-contact control), delivery (to parent, child, or both), study type (pilot or not), child age, and intervention duration. FINDINGS: In total, 3406 records were screened for inclusion; 55 studies representing 54 unique RCTs met inclusion criteria. Most (89%) included articles were of high or moderate quality. Thirty studies relied mostly or solely on technology for intervention delivery. Meta-analyses of the 20 prevention RCTs did not show a significant effect of prevention interventions on weight outcomes (d = 0.05, p = 0.52). The pooled mean effect size of n = 32 treatment RCTs showed a small, significant effect on weight outcomes (d = ‒0.13, p = 0.001), although 27 of 33 treatment studies (79%) did not find significant differences between treatment and comparators. There were significantly greater treatment effects on outcomes for pilot interventions, interventions delivered to the child compared to parent-delivered interventions, and as child age increased and intervention duration decreased. No other subgroup analyses were significant. CONCLUSIONS: Recent technology-based interventions for the treatment of pediatric obesity show small effects on weight; however, evidence is inconclusive on the efficacy of technology based prevention interventions. Research is needed to determine the comparative effectiveness of technology-based interventions to gold-standard interventions and elucidate the potential for mHealth/eHealth to increase scalability and reduce costs while maximizing impact.","Fowler, Lauren A.; Grammer, Anne Claire; Staiano, Amanda E.; Fitzsimmons-Craft, Ellen E.; Chen, Ling; Yaeger, Lauren H.; Wilfley, Denise E.",Int J Obes (Lond),https://doi.org/10.1038/s41366-021-00765-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33627775/,254

Recently developed highly multiplexed sequencing assays that rely on high-throughput sequencing (HMSAs) can, in principle, meet these demands, and present promising alternatives to currently used RT-qPCR-based tests. However, the analysis and interpretation of HMSAs requires overcoming several computational and statistical challenges. Using recently acquired experimental data, we present and validate an accurate and fast computational testing workflow based on kallisto and bustools, that utilize robust statistical methods and fast, memory efficient algorithms for processing high-throughput sequencing data. We show that our workflow is effective at processing data from all recently proposed SARS-CoV-2 sequencing based diagnostic tests, and is generally applicable to any diagnostic HMSAs.","Booeshaghi, A.

For this purpose, we employ the γ̅-Maclaurin series along with an amendment of the power series technique. To supplement our idea, we present the necessary convergence analysis regarding the γ̅-Maclaurin series. As for the application side, we solved versions of the higher-dimensional heat and wave models with spatial and temporal Caputo fractional derivatives in terms of a rapidly convergent γ̅-Maclaurin series. The method performed extremely well, and the projections of the obtained solutions into the integer space are compatible with solutions available in the literature.

METHODS: This is a prospective single‐institution study from 15 March to 13 May 2020. Thirty‐two patients received PCR nasopharyngeal swabs. Of these, 28 patients had a thoracic CT‐scan, 31 patients had blood and urine examinations, 24 patients had skin biopsies including immunohistochemical and direct immunofluorescence studies, and four patients had electron microscopy. RESULTS: COVID‐19‐induced chilblains are clinically and histopathologically identical to chilblains from other causes. Although intravascular thrombi are sometimes observed, no patient had a systemic coagulopathy or severe clinical course. The exhaustive clinical, radiological, and laboratory work‐up in this study ruled‐out other primary and secondary causes. Electron microscopy revealed rare, probable viral particles whose core and spikes measured from 120 to 133 nm within endothelium and eccrine glands in two cases. CONCLUSION: This study provides further clinicopathologic evidence of COVID‐19‐related chilblains. Negative PCR and antibody tests do not rule‐out infection. Chilblains represent a good prognosis, occurring later in the disease course. No systemic coagulopathy was identified in any patient. Patients presenting with acral lesions should be isolated, and chilblains should be distinguished from thrombotic lesions (livedo racemosa, retiform purpura, or ischemic acral necrosis).","Kolivras, Athanassios; Thompson, Curtis; Pastushenko, Ievgenia; Mathieu, Marisa; Bruderer, Pascal; de Vicq, Marine; Feoli, Francesco; Harag, Saadia; Meiers, Isabelle; Olemans, Catherine; Sass, Ursula; Dehavay, Florence; Fakih, Ali; Lam‐Hoai, Xuan‐Lan; Marneffe, Alice; Van De Borne, Laura; Vandersleyen, Valerie; Richert, Bertrand",J Cutan Pathol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34272741/; https://doi.org/10.1111/cup.14099,254

667196,A comparative study of two methods for treatment of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo in the emergency department,2021-05-03,"Earliness in crop plants has a crucial role in avoiding the stress of drought and heat, which are the most important challenging stressors in crop production and are predicted to increase in the near future due to global warming. Furthermore, it provides a guarantee of vegetable production in the short growing season of agricultural lands in the northern hemisphere and at high altitudes. The growing human population needs super early plant cultivars for these agricultural lands to meet future global demands. This study examined de novo super-early progeny, referred to as much earlier than that of the earlier parent, which flowered in 13–17 days and pod setting in 18–29 days after germination, discovered in F(2) and studied up to F(5) derived from interspecific crosses between garden pea (P. sativum L.) and the most distant relative of pea (P. fulvum Sibth. et Sm.). De novo super-early progeny were found to be earlier by about one month than P. sativum and two months than P. fulvum under short day conditions in the F(5) population. In respect of days to flowering and pod setting, de novo super-early progeny had a relatively high level of narrow sense heritability (h(2) = 82% and 80%, respectively), indicating that the selections for earliness in segregating populations was effective for improvement of extreme early maturing varieties. De novo super-early progeny could be grown under heat stress conditions due to the escape ability. Vegetable types were not only high yielding but also free of any known undesirable traits from the wild species, such as pod dehiscence and non-uniform maturity. It could be considered complementary to “speed breeding”, possibly obtaining more than six generations per year in a suitable climate chamber. Not only de novo super-early progeny but also transgressive segregation for agro-morphological traits can be created via interspecific crosses between P. sativum and P. fulvum, a precious unopened treasure in the second gene pool. Useful progeny obtained from crossing wild species with cultivated species reveal the importance of wild species.","Sari, Hatice; Sari, Duygu; Eker, Tuba; Toker, Cengiz",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-99284-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34611237/,254

Immediately after the disaster, it is challenging to estimate the demand for emergency relief materials. As a result, the demand for such materials at the point of demand and the corresponding transportation costs for the entire supply chain network becomes uncertain. This paper proposes a new probabilistic fuzzy goal programming model for making decisions to manage the post-disaster supply of emergency relief materials. A suggested procedure converts the proposed model to its deterministic equivalent when the demands for the relief materials follow uniform distributions. We implement the differential evolution, a metaheuristic technique, for analyzing demand satisfaction for relief materials under various scenarios. A case example based on the Nepal Earthquake in 2015 demonstrates the usefulness of the proposed approach. The solution of the model will help the Disaster Management Agency coordinate with the humanitarian organizations and foreign countries to provide the required emergency relief materials so that an adequate level of supply can be assured to the affected areas with the least possible transportation cost.","Jana, Rabin K.; Sharma, Dinesh K.; Mehta, Peeyush",Ann Oper Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34539018/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10479-021-04267-x,254
667473,Control of type 2 diabetes mellitus during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021-06-26,"BACKGROUND: The current EU LULUCF regulation calls for member state-specific Forest Reference Levels (FRLs) for benchmark in the accounting of greenhouse gas emissions and removals of managed forest land during the compliance period (2021–2030). According to the technical guidance on developing and reporting the FRLs, it could be actualized by projecting a ratio of harvested to total available biomass. We tested how the initial age distribution may affect the aforementioned ratio by simulating the continuation of forest management based on several descriptive shapes of forest age class distribution. RESULTS: Our simulations suggest that when the FRLs are prepared by employing the harvest ratio and forest management is assumed strictly age dynamics driven, the shape of the initial forest age class distribution gives rise to computational sinks or sources of carbon in managed forest land. Harvests projected according to the ratio corresponded those resulting from the age dynamics only in the case of uniform age distribution. CONCLUSIONS: The result calls for a better consideration of variation in initial states between countries when determining the future LULUCF regulation. Our exercise demonstrates how generic simulations in a standardized modeling framework could help in ex-ante impact assessment of proposed changes to the LULUCF regulation.

We aimed to conduct a rapid review of mother-to-child transmission of COVID-19 during breastfeeding. Methods: We systematically searched Medline, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane library, China Biology Medicine disc, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang, and preprint articles up to March 2020. We included studies relevant to transmission through milk and respiratory droplets during breastfeeding of mothers with COVID-19, SARS, MERS and influenza. Two reviewers independently screened studies for eligibility, extracted data, assessed risk of bias and used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence. Results: A total of 4481 records were identified in our literature search. Six studies (five case reports and one case series) involving 58 mothers (16 mothers with COVID-19, 42 mothers with influenza) and their infants proved eligible. Five case reports showed that the viral nucleic acid tests for all thirteen collected samples of breast milk from mothers with COVID-19 were negative. A case series of 42 influenza infected postpartum mothers taking precautions (hand hygiene and wearing masks) before breastfeeding showed that no neonates were infected with influenza during one-month of follow-up. Conclusions: The current evidence indicates that SARS-CoV-2 viral nucleic acid has not been detected in breast milk. The benefits of breastfeeding may outweigh the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in infants. Mothers with COVID-19 should take appropriate precautions to reduce the risk of transmission via droplets and close contact during breastfeeding.

Keeping in mind its emergence, we developed a molecular detection system and utilized it to study vector competence and evaluate activity of antiviral compounds against RRV. A SYBR Green I-based quantitative RT-PCR for detection of RRV was developed targeting the E2 gene, with a detection limit of 100 RNA copies/reaction. The specificity was confirmed with closely related Alphaviruses and Flaviviruses. The assay was applied to study the vector competence of Indian Aedes aegypti for RRV, which revealed 100% infection and dissemination rate with 75% transmission rate. Viral RNA was found in saliva as early as 3 day post infection (dpi). Further application of the assay in antiviral drug evaluation revealed the superior in vitro activity of ribavirin compared to chloroquine in Vero cells. Successful demonstration of this assay to detect RRV in low titre mosquito samples makes it a sensitive tool in vector surveillance. This study also showed that Indian Ae. aegypti are well competent to transmit RRV highlighting the risk of its introduction to naïve territories across continents. Further validation of this assay, revealed its utility in screening of potential antivirals against RRV.","Dash, Paban Kumar; Agarwal, Ankita; Sharma, Shashi; Saha, Amrita; Joshi, Gaurav; Gopalan, Natarajan; Sukumaran, Devanathan; Parida, Man Mohan",J Virol Methods,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093416301288; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093416301288; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27105737/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2016.04.011,254

METHODS: ITIS was used to measure cutaneous temperature in 1275 airline travellers who had agreed to tympanic temperature measurement and respiratory sampling. The prediction by ITIS of tympanic temperature (37.8°C and 37.5°C) and of influenza infection was assessed using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and estimated sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value (PPV). FINDINGS: Using front of face ITIS for prediction of tympanic temperature ≥37.8°C, the area under the ROC curve was 0.86 (95%CI 0.75–0.97) and setting sensitivity at 86% gave specificity of 71%. The PPV in this population of travellers, of whom 0.5% were febrile using this definition, was 1.5%. We identified influenza virus infection in 30 travellers (3 Type A and 27 Type B). For ITIS prediction of influenza infection the area under the ROC curve was 0.66 (0.56–0.75), a sensitivity of 87% gave specificity of 39%, and PPV of 2.8%. None of the 30 influenza-positive travellers had tympanic temperature ≥37.8°C at screening (95%CI 0% to 12%); three had no influenza symptoms. CONCLUSION: ITIS performed moderately well in detecting fever but in this study, during a seasonal epidemic of predominantly influenza type B, the proportion of influenza-infected travellers who were febrile was low and ITIS were not much better than chance at identifying travellers likely to be influenza-infected. Although febrile illness is more common in influenza A infections than influenza B infections, many influenza A infections are afebrile. Our findings therefore suggest that ITIS is unlikely to be effective for entry screening of travellers to detect influenza infection with the intention of preventing entry of the virus into a country.","Priest, Patricia C.; Duncan, Alasdair R.; Jennings, Lance C.; Baker, Michael G.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21245928/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0014490,254

We hypothesize a consequence of COVID-19 is reduced operative volume across the country. We aim to examine changes in volume of common gastrointestinal operations during COVID-19, including elective, urgent/emergent, and cancer operations. We also evaluate if hospitals with more COVID-19 admissions were most impacted. METHODS: The Vizient database was used to determine monthly operative volume from November 2019 to June 2020 for elective operations (hiatal hernia repairs, bariatric surgery), urgent operations (cholecystectomies, appendectomies, inguinal hernia repairs), and cancer operations (colectomies, gastrectomies, esophagectomies). COVID-19 admissions per hospital were also determined. November 2019–January 2020 was defined as “pre-COVID.” The monthly reduction in volume from pre-COVID was calculated for each operation. The top quartile (25%) of hospitals with the most COVID admissions were also evaluated separately from hospitals with fewer COVID cases. Data were analyzed using analysis of variance. RESULTS: Data from 559 hospitals were analyzed. The volumes of all operations evaluated were significantly reduced during the pandemic except gastrectomies and esophagectomies for cancer. The greatest reduction in all operations was in April. In April, the volume of bariatric surgery reduced by 98% (P < 0.001), hiatal hernia repairs by 96% (P < 0.001), urgent cholecystectomies by 42% (P < 0.001), urgent inguinal hernia repairs by 40% (P < 0.001), urgent appendectomies by 24% (P < 0.001), and colectomies for cancer by 39% (P < 0.001). Hospitals with the most COVID-19 admissions had greater reductions in all operations than hospitals with fewer COVID cases. CONCLUSIONS: The coronavirus pandemic led to a significant reduction in volume of all gastrointestinal operations evaluated except gastrectomies and esophagectomies. While elective, non-cancer operations were most affected, urgent and some cancer operations also declined significantly. As COVID-19 continues to surge, Americans may suffer continued limited access to surgical care and a significant operative backlog may be forthcoming.","Purdy, Amanda C.; Smith, Brian R.; Hohmann, Samuel F.; Nguyen, Ninh T.",Surg Endosc,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-021-08477-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33871720/,254

After its emergence in late 1970s, the CPV original type (CPV-2) was rapidly and totally replaced by three antigenic variants named CPV-2a, CPV-2b and CPV-2c. CPV has an evolutionary rate nearest to those of RNA viruses, with consequences on disease diagnosis and epidemiology. This paper reports the molecular characterization of eight CPV-2a strains collected from dogs in Italy in 2016–2017. Genetic analysis was conducted on a CPV genomic region encompassing both open reading frames (ORFs) encoding for nonstructural (NS1-NS2) and structural proteins (VP1-VP2). Sequence analysis indicates new and unreported sequence changes, mainly affecting the VP2 gene, which included the mutation Tyr324Leu. This study represents the first evidence of a new CPV-2a mutant (VP2 324Leu) and illustrates the importance of a continuous molecular survey in order to obtain more information on effective spread of new CPV mutants.","Mira, Francesco; Dowgier, Giulia; Purpari, Giuseppa; Vicari, Domenico; Di Bella, Santina; Macaluso, Giusi; Gucciardi, Francesca; Randazzo, Vincenzo; Decaro, Nicola; Guercio, Annalisa",Infect Genet Evol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567134818300972; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134818300972; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2018.03.010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29548803/,254

675048,Should We Prescribe Antibiotics in Older Patients Presenting COVID-19 Pneumonia?,2020-12-04,"BACKGROUND: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a common and disabling disease with high rates of mortality and morbidity. The role of steroids in treating ARDS remains controversial. We aim to examine the evidence behind using glucocorticoids in the management of ARDS from the available studies. METHODS: We performed a literature review of major electronic databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing glucocorticoids versus placebo in treating patients with ARDS. Our primary outcome was hospital mortality. Other outcomes included ICU mortality, number of ventilator-free days at day 28, incidence of nosocomial infections, and hyperglycemia. We performed a meta-analysis using a random effects model to calculate risk ratios (RR) and mean difference (MD) with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI). A subsequent trial sequential analysis was performed to examine the strength of evidence and to guard against statistical type I and type II errors for our results. RESULTS: Eight RCTs were included in the final analysis totaling of 1091 patients, with a mean age of 57 ± 16, and 56.2% were male. In our pooled analysis, use of glucocorticoids was associated with a significant reduction in hospital mortality (RR 0.79; 95% CI 0.64–0.98; P = 0.03) and ICU mortality (RR 0.64; 95% CI 0.42–0.97; P = 0.04). Furthermore, glucocorticoid use was associated with an increased number of ventilator-free days at day 28 (MD 4.06 days; 95% CI 2.66–5.45; P < 0.01). Regarding adverse events, glucocorticoids use was not associated with an increased risk for nosocomial infections (RR 0.82; 95% CI 0.68–1.00; P = 0.05); however, it was associated with an increased risk of hyperglycemia (RR 1.11; 95% CI 1.01–1.24; P = 0.04). In our trial sequential analysis, the required diversity-adjusted information size (sample size = 2692 patients) was not reached, and the evidence was insufficient from the available RCTs. CONCLUSION: Among patients with ARDS, use of glucocorticoids is associated with a significant reduction in mortality and duration of mechanical ventilation, without increased risk of hospital-acquired infections. However, based on a trial sequential analysis, these findings may be secondary to a false-positive (type I) error. Further studies are needed for a firm conclusion with guarding against possible statistical errors.","Zayed, Yazan; Barbarawi, Mahmoud; Ismail, Esraa; Samji, Varun; Kerbage, Josiane; Rizk, Fatima; Salih, Mohammad; Bala, Areeg; Obeid, Michele; Deliwala, Smit; Demian, Sherry; Al-Sanouri, Ibrahim; Reddy, Raju",J Intensive Care,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40560-020-00464-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32612838/,254

Despite the development of multiple effective vaccines, new vaccines continue to be required to supply ongoing demand. We report Day 42 interim safety and immunogenicity data from a Phase 2, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in Adults aged 18+ immunized with a virus-like particle vaccine candidate produced in plants displaying SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (CoVLP) adjuvanted with AS03 (NCT04636697). This report focuses on presenting safety, tolerability and immunogenicity, as measured by neutralizing antibody (NAb) and cell mediated immunity (IFN-{gamma} and IL-4 ELISpot) responses, in Adults aged 18-64 (Adults) and Older Adults aged 65+ (Older Adults). CoVLP adjuvanted with AS03 was well-tolerated and adverse events (AE) were primarily mild or moderate and of transient duration. AEs in Older Adults were more limited than those observed in the Adult population. CoVLP with AS03 induced a significant humoral immune response in both age cohorts. CoVLP with AS03 induced a greater humoral response in Adults than Older Adults after a single dose but this effect was overcome with a second dose when both age cohorts responded with NAb titers that were ~10-fold higher than those in a panel of sera from patients recovering from COVID-19. A single dose of CoVLP with AS03 induced a significant IFN-{gamma} response in both age cohorts; a second dose significantly boosted IFN-{gamma} and IL-4 responses in both age cohorts. Adults generated a stronger IFN-{gamma} and IL-4 cellular response than did Older Adults after one or two doses of AS03-adjuvanted CoVLP. Safety and immunogenicity from Adults with comorbidities as well as final safety and immunogenicity responses after 12 months will be reported upon availability.","Gobeil, P.; Pillet, S.; Seguin, A.; Boulay, I.; Mahmood, A.; Vinh, D.

With the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic substantially interrupting control programmes worldwide, there are now mounting fears that decades of progress in controlling global parasitic infections will be undone. With Covid-19 moreover exposing deep vulnerabilities in the global health system, the current moment presents a watershed opportunity to plan future efforts to reduce the global morbidity and mortality associated with human parasitic infections. In this chapter, we first provide a brief epidemiologic overview of the progress that has been made towards the control of parasitic diseases between 1990 and 2019, contrasting these fragile gains with the anticipated losses as a result of Covid-19. We then argue that the complementary aspirations of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the World Health Organization (WHO)’s 2030 targets for parasitic disease control may be achieved by aligning programme objectives within the One Health paradigm, recognizing the interdependence between humans, animals, and the environment. In so doing, we note that while the WHO remains the preeminent international institution to address some of these transdisciplinary concerns, its underlying challenges with funding, authority, and capacity are likely to reverberate if left unaddressed. To this end, we conclude by reimagining how models of multisectoral global health governance—combining the WHO's normative and technical leadership with greater support in allied policy-making areas—can help sustain future malaria and NTD elimination efforts.","Ung, Lawson; Stothard, J.

BACKGROUND: Fever clinic is the first line of defence against the epidemic during COVID-19 in China. METHODS: Our study combines the Delphi method and the analytic hierarchy process. Delphi method was used to carry out two rounds of consultation for 18 experts, to select and revise indicators at all levels. Analytic hierarchy process was used to calculate the weight of indicators at all levels. RESULTS: A quality evaluation system of nursing management for fever clinics is built using Delphi method. It includes five first-level indexes, 14 second-level indexes and 82 third-level indexes. A two-round expert consultation is used to build the indicators. The recovery rates of expert questionnaires in the two rounds were, respectively, 100% and 94%, and expert authority coefficients were 0.925. The Kendall coefficients in the two rounds were, respectively, 0.205 and 0.162 (P < .001). The weight analysis shows that health management of nursing staff (0.2803) and disinfection isolation and treatment of medical waste (0.2803) are most important, followed by nursing post management and personnel training (0.1889), configuration and management of equipment (0.1427) and patient consultation management and nursing (0.1078).

682231,Essential inpatient otolaryngology: what COVID-19 has revealed,2021-07-10,"In numerous applications, including current body temperature monitoring in viral pandemic management, thermal imaging cameras are used for quantitative measurements. These require determination of the measurement accuracy (error) and its traceability (measurement uncertainty). Within error estimation, the size-of-source effect (SSE) is an important error source. The SSE is the relation between the physical size of a target and the instrument’s nominal target size. This study presents a direct evaluation of the error due to the SSE. A stable and uniform temperature, generated by blackbodies, was measured by a high-quality thermal imager. To limit the generated radiation, custom-made blocking tiles with different apertures were used. Effects of aperture shapes and positions, camera-target distances and temperature levels on the error were investigated. The study findings suggest that due to the SSE the measured temperatures are too low, especially at longer camera-target distances. The SSE error depends on the number of pixels available and included into the region of interest, for which the accurate measurement is about to be performed. For an accurate temperature measurement, an array of at least 10 × 10 pixels should be exposed to the observed target radiation, while 3 × 3 central pixel area should be included in the temperature calculation.","Pušnik, Igor; Geršak, Gregor",Sensors (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/s21020607; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33467205/,254

MATERIAL/METHODS: A total of 108 hospitalized patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University from January 17, 2020 to March 12, 2020 were enrolled. Data of demographic parameters, clinical characteristics, laboratory indicators, clinical manifestation, and outcome of disease were collected. The patients were divided into a severe group and a non-severe group according to diagnosis and classification, which followed the guidelines and management of the Chinese National Health Council COVID-19. The receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and comparison of ROC curves were used for the laboratory findings for assessment of COVID-19 severity. RESULTS: Of the 108 patients, 42 patients (38.9%) were male and 24 patients (22.2%) were considered severe cases, with the mean age of 51.0 years old. Males and patients with comorbidities were more likely to become severe cases. CRP increased and LYM decreased in the severe group.The results for the areas under the curve (AUC) of CRP/LYM and CRP used to assess severe COVID-19 were 0.787 (95% CI 0.698–0.860, P<0.0001) and 0.781 (95% CI 0.693–0.856, P<0.0001), respectively; both results were better than that of LYM. The associated criterion value of CRP/LYM was calculated, with an excellent sensitivity of 95.83%. CONCLUSIONS: The effect of CRP/LYM and CRP on the assessment for severe COVID-19 may be superior to LYM alone.

Many professional organizations initially placed restrictions on breast reconstruction, leading surgeons to conceive innovative protocols for offering breast reconstruction. This study reviewed the current evidence on breast reconstruction during the COVID-19 pandemic to provide guidance for surgeons facing future crises. METHODS: The MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched for studies (1) describing implant and autologous breast reconstruction following mastectomy and (2) occurring during or pertaining to the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Of the 1347 studies identified, 26 were included. Studies discussed type of reconstruction (18, 69%), complications (11, 42%), timing of reconstruction (10, 38%), protocols (10, 38%), COVID-19 screening (7, 27%), and length of hospital stay (7, 27%). The type of reconstruction varied depending on the stage of the pandemic: early on, autologous breast reconstruction was halted to preserve resources, but was later resumed. Within implant-based reconstruction, direct-to-implant was favored over serial tissue expansion. Several protocols were developed, with many emphasizing multidisciplinary collaborations for patient selection, use of specialized measures to reduce risk of COVID-19 transmission, and optimization of same-day discharge. Complication rates following breast reconstruction were similar to pre-pandemic rates. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has forever changed the landscape of breast reconstruction by raising important questions about delivery of care, cost, and resource utilization. The findings of this review may inform surgeons as they plan for similar future crises or strive for improved patient care and efficacy even during nonpandemic times.","Hemal, Kshipra; Boyd, Carter J.; Bekisz, Jonathan M.; Salibian, Ara A.; Choi, Mihye; Karp, Nolan S.",Plast Reconstr Surg Glob Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34584831/; https://doi.org/10.1097/gox.0000000000003852,254

These defense mechanisms rely partly on receptors that monitor the cytosol for the presence of atypical nucleic acids associated with virus infection. RIG-I-like receptors detect RNA molecules that are absent from the uninfected host. DNA receptors alert the cell to the abnormal presence of that nucleic acid in the cytosol. Signaling by RNA and DNA receptors results in the induction of restriction factors that prevent virus replication and establish cell-intrinsic antiviral immunity. In light of these formidable obstacles, viruses have evolved mechanisms of evasion, masking nucleic acid structures recognized by the host, sequestering themselves away from the cytosol or targeting host sensors, and signaling adaptors for deactivation or degradation. Here, we detail recent advances in the molecular understanding of cytosolic nucleic acid detection and its evasion by viruses.","Goubau, Delphine; Deddouche, Safia; Reis e Sousa, Caetano",Immunity,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.immuni.2013.05.007; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1074761313002045; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1074761313002045; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23706667/,254

It has been suggested that venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was suitable in this indication, albeit the effects of ECMO on the mechanical respiratory parameters have been scarcely described. In this case-series, we prospectively described the use of venovenous ECMO and its effects on mechanical respiratory parameters in eleven COVID-19 patients with severe ARDS. Implantation of ECMO occurred 6 [3–11] days after the onset of mechanical ventilation. At the time of ECMO implantation, all patients received neuromuscular blocking agents, three (27%) received inhaled nitric oxide and prone positioning was performed in all patients with 4 [3−5] sessions of PP per patient. Under ECMO, the tidal volume was significantly decreased from 6.1 [4.0–6.3] to 3.4 [2.5–3.6] mL/kg of predicted body weight and the positive end-expiratory pressure level was increased by 25 ± 27% whereas the driving pressure and the mechanical power decreased by 33 ± 25% and 71 ± 27%, respectively.

687417,Diabetes clinic reinvented: will technology change the future of diabetes care?,2021-03-23,"COVID-19 epidemic in Malaysia started as a small wave of 22 cases in January 2020 through imported cases. It was followed by a bigger wave mainly from local transmissions resulting in 651 cases. The following wave saw unexpectedly three digit number of daily cases following a mass gathering urged the government to choose a more stringent measure. A limited lock-down approach called Movement Control Order (MCO) was immediately initiated to the whole country as a way to suppress the epidemic trajectory. The lock-down causes a major socio-economic disruption thus the ability to forecast the infection dynamic is urgently required to assist the government on timely decisions. Limited testing capacity and limited epidemiological data complicate the understanding of the future infection dynamic of the COVID-19 epidemic. Three different epidemic forecasting models was used to generate forecasts of COVID-19 cases in Malaysia using daily reported cumulative case data up until 1st April 2020 from the Malaysia Ministry of Health. The forecasts were generated using a Curve Fitting Model with Probability Density Function and Skewness Effect, the SIR Model, and a System Dynamic Model. Method one based on curve fitting with probability density function estimated that the peak will be on 19th April 2020 with an estimation of 5,637 infected persons. Method two based on SIR Model estimated that the peak will be on 20th - 31st May 2020 if Movement Contro (MCO) is in place with an estimation of 630,000 to 800,000 infected persons. Method three based on System Dynamic Model estimated that the peak will be on 17th May 2020 with an estimation of 22,421 infected persons. Forecasts from each of model suggested the epidemic may peak between middle of April to end of May 2020.

688046,Transitioning Traditions in the Time of COVID,2020-12-22,"Background The effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in frail older adults living in Long-Term Care Facilities (LTCFs) is uncertain. We estimated protective effects of the first dose of ChAdOx1 and BNT162b2 vaccines against infection in this population. Methods Cohort study comparing vaccinated and unvaccinated LTCF residents in England, undergoing routine asymptomatic testing (8 December 2020 - 15 March 2021). We estimated the relative hazard of PCR-positive infection using Cox proportional hazards regression, adjusting for age, sex, prior infection, local SARS-CoV-2 incidence, LTCF bed capacity, and clustering by LTCF. Results Of 10,412 residents (median age 86 years) from 310 LTCFs, 9,160 were vaccinated with either ChAdOx1 (6,138; 67%) or BNT162b2 (3,022; 33%) vaccines. A total of 670,628 person days and 1,335 PCR-positive infections were included. Adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) for PCR-positive infection relative to unvaccinated residents declined from 28 days following the first vaccine dose to 0.44 (0.24, 0.81) at 28-34 days and 0.38 (0.19, 0.77) at 35-48 days. Similar effect sizes were seen for ChAdOx1 (aHR 0.32 [0.15-0.66] and BNT162b2 (aHR 0.35 [0.17, 0.71]) vaccines at 35-48 days. Mean PCR cycle threshold values were higher, implying lower infectivity, for infections 28 or more days post-vaccination compared with those prior to vaccination (31.3 vs 26.6, p<0.001). Interpretation The first dose of BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 vaccines was associated with substantially reduced SARS-CoV-2 infection risk in LTCF residents from 4 weeks to at least 7 weeks.

Products were initially classified into four types: i.e., veggie, red meat-, fish- and poultry-based. Gluten, wheat, and soy were the most declared allergens regardless of the burgers type. Veggie burgers showed levels of energy, fat, and saturate fatty acids (SFA) similar to fish- and poultry-based burgers, but lower than red meat burgers. Compared to conventional burgers, veggie had higher amounts of carbohydrates and sugars and a lower content of proteins, but no difference in salt. Due to the high compositional intra-variability in the veggie burgers, vegetarian and vegan burgers were further analyzed separately. Vegan burgers had higher levels of energy, fat, SFA and protein than vegetarian burgers, but lower carbohydrates and sugars. Once again large differences in the nutritional parameters were observed in both vegan and vegetarian burger categories due to the wide range of ingredients and formulations employed in these types of products. A clear and comprehensive informative labeling is especially needed for vegan and vegetarian burgers to allow the consumer to make a rational decision based on the nutritional facts of these products.

689301,Use of a negative pressure procedural tent in the Emergency Department during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021-01-27,"OBJECTIVES: Jeju Province in Korea reported 627 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases between January 20, 2020, and March 31, 2021. This study analyzed the sources of infection among confirmed cases in Jeju Province, a self-governed island. METHODS: The sources of infection were broadly categorized as follows: (1) infections from overseas (confirmed patients who reported travel overseas or contact with overseas travelers); (2) infections from outside Jeju Province (confirmed patients who had visited other provinces or had contact with individuals who had traveled to other provinces in Korea); and (3) unknown sources of infection (confirmed patients who were infected following contact with an infected person whose source of infection was unknown). The chi-square test was used to analyze the differences in the distributions of related variables for each source of infection. RESULTS: Of the 627 confirmed cases, 38 (6.1%) were infections from overseas sources, 199 (31.7%) were from outside of Jeju Province, and 390 (62.2%) were from unknown sources. Jeju Province had no cases with an unknown source of infection during the first and second waves of the nationwide outbreak. CONCLUSIONS: Infections from overseas sources could be blocked from spreading to local communities in Jeju Province by conducting screening at the airport, along with the preemptive suspension of visa-free entry. In addition, considering the scale of the nationwide outbreak, measures must be established to delay outbreaks from unknown sources of infection caused by sources outside Jeju Province.","Hwang, Moonkyong; Bae, Jong-Myon",J Prev Med Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3961/jpmph.21.286; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34370937/,254

They are not only highly transmissible (acquired through droplets), but Host reservoirs such as dromedary camels for MERS-CoV and masked palm civet for SARS-CoV are critical links in the onset of outbreaks. Clinically they present with flu-like symptoms and therefore a high index of suspicion is required to ensure timely diagnosis and tailored management. Although there are not many reported series on these infections in pregnancy they seem to be associated with an increased risk of preterm delivery and maternal mortality. Diagnosis is made by PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs. There are currently no effective anti-viral agents for these viruses but following infections various agents have been administered to patients. The most important aspect of management should be early identification of deterioration and intensive support and prevention of transmission. Our understanding of the evidence of the impact of both infections on pregnancies suggests the potential for future repeat outbreaks, hence the importance of maintaining vigilance across healthcare systems.","Babarinsa, Isaac A.; Okunoye, Gbemisola O.; Odukoya, Olusegun",Eur J Obstet Gynecol Reprod Biol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0301211521002992; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301211521002992?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34218204/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejogrb.2021.06.020,254

Viral mutations emerge during the virus circulating in the population, which is shaping the viral infectivity and pathogenicity. Here we extensively analyzed 6698 SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequences with specific sample collection dates in NCBI database. We found that four mutations, i.e., 5’UTR_c-241-t, NSP3_c-3037-t, NSP12_c-14408-t, and S_a-23403-g, became the dominant variants and each of them represented nearly 100% of all virus sequences since the middle May, 2020. Notably, we found that co-occurrence rates of three significant multi-site co-mutational patterns, i.e., (i) S_a-23403-g, NSP12_c-14408-t, 5’UTR_c-241-t, NSP3_c-3037-t, and ORF3a_c-25563-t; (ii) ORF8_t-28144-c, NSP4_c-8782-t, NSP14_c-18060-t, NSP13_a-17858-g, and NSP13_c-17747-t; and (iii) N_g-28881-a, N_g-28882-a, and N_g-28883-c, reached 66%, 90%, and nearly 100% of recent sequences, respectively. Moreover, we found significant decrease of CpG dinucleotide at positions 241(c)-242(g) in the 5’UTR during the evolution, which was verified as a potential target of human zinc finger antiviral protein (ZAP). The four dominant mutations, three significant multi-site co-mutations, and the potential escape mutation of ZAP-target in 5’UTR region contribute to the rapid evolution of SARS-CoV-2 virus in the population, thus shaping the viral infectivity and pathogenicity. This study provides valuable clues and frameworks to dissect the viral replication and virus-host interactions for designing effective therapeutics. One Sentence Summary Four dominant mutations, three significant multi-site co-mutations, and 5’UTR CpG escape contribute to the rapid evolution of SARS-CoV-2 virus.","Zhang, Jingsong; Kang, Junyan; Liu, Mofang; Han, Benhao; Li, Li; He, Yongqun; Yi, Zhigang; Chen, Luonan",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.21.213405,254
