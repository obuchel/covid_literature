2580,Transportation of patients on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation: a tertiary medical center experience and systematic review of the literature,2017-02-07,"BACKGROUND: Utilization of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has increased worldwide, but its use remains restricted to severely ill patients, and few referral centers are properly structured to offer this support. Inter-hospital transfer of patients on ECMO support can be life-threatening. In this study, we report a single-center experience and a systematic review of the available published data on complications and mortality associated with ECMO transportation. METHODS: We reported single-center data regarding complications and mortality associated with the transportation of patients on ECMO support. Additionally, we searched multiple databases for case series, observational studies, and randomized controlled trials regarding mortality of patients transferred on ECMO support. Results were analyzed independently for pediatric (under 12 years old) and adult populations. We pooled mortality rates using a random-effects model. Complications and transportation data were also described. RESULTS: A total of 38 manuscripts, including our series, were included in the final analysis, totaling 1481 patients transported on ECMO support. A total of 951 patients survived to hospital discharge. The pooled survival rates for adult and pediatric patients were 62% (95% CI 57–68) and 68% (95% CI 60–75), respectively. Two deaths occurred during patient transportation. No other complication resulting in adverse outcome was reported. CONCLUSION: Using the available pooled data, we found that patient transfer to a referral institution while on ECMO support seems to be safe and adds no significant risk of mortality to ECMO patients.

4478,Neurally adjusted ventilatory assist vs. pressure support to deliver protective mechanical ventilation in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: a randomized crossover trial,2020-02-10,"Positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses form the largest and most diverse group of eukaryote-infecting viruses. Their genomes comprise one or more segments of coding-sense RNA that function directly as messenger RNAs upon release into the cytoplasm of infected cells. Positive-sense RNA viruses are generally accepted to encode proteins solely on the positive strand. However, we previously identified a surprisingly long (∼1,000-codon) open reading frame (ORF) on the negative strand of some members of the family Narnaviridae which, together with RNA bacteriophages of the family Leviviridae, form a sister group to all other positive-sense RNA viruses. Here, we completed the genomes of three mosquito-associated narnaviruses, all of which have the long reverse-frame ORF. We systematically identified narnaviral sequences in public data sets from a wide range of sources, including arthropod, fungal, and plant transcriptomic data sets. Long reverse-frame ORFs are widespread in one clade of narnaviruses, where they frequently occupy >95 per cent of the genome. The reverse-frame ORFs correspond to a specific avoidance of CUA, UUA, and UCA codons (i.e. stop codon reverse complements) in the forward-frame RNA-dependent RNA polymerase ORF. However, absence of these codons cannot be explained by other factors such as inability to decode these codons or GC3 bias. Together with other analyses, we provide the strongest evidence yet of coding capacity on the negative strand of a positive-sense RNA virus. As these ORFs comprise some of the longest known overlapping genes, their study may be of broad relevance to understanding overlapping gene evolution and de novo origin of genes.","Dinan, Adam M; Lukhovitskaya, Nina I; Olendraite, Ingrida; Firth, Andrew E",Virus Evol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7010960/,16
9971,"Commentary: “To list, or not to list? That is the question”",2020-03-20,"BACKGROUND: Profiling immune responses induced by either infection or vaccination can provide insight into identification of correlates of protection. Furthermore, profiling of serological responses can be used to identify biomarkers indicative of exposure to pathogens. Conducting such immune surveillance requires readout methods that are high-throughput, robust, and require small sample volumes. While the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is the classical readout method for assessing serological responses, the advent of multiplex assays has significantly increased the throughput and capacity for immunoprofiling. This report describes the development and assay performance (sensitivity, linearity of detection, requirement for multiple dilutions for each sample, intra- and inter-assay variability) of an electro-chemiluminescence (ECLIA)-based multiplex assay. METHODS: The current study describes the development of a multiplex ECLIA-based assay and characterizes the sensitivity, linear range, and inter- and intra-assay variability of the ECLIA platform and its agreement with the traditional ELISA. Special emphasis was placed on potential antigenic competition when testing closely related antigens in the multiplex format. RESULTS: Multiplexing of antigens in ECLIA provides significant practical benefits in terms of reducing sample volume requirements and experimental time. Beyond the practical advantages of multiplexing, the ECLIA provides superior assay performance when compared to the ELISA. Not only does ECLIA show good agreement with the ELISA assay, but the linear range of ECLIA is also sufficiently wide to permit single-dilution measurements of concentration without the need to do serial dilutions. The lack of antigenic competition allows the simultaneous testing of closely related antigens, such as plate antigens representing different alleles of the same protein, which can inform about cross-reactivities—or lack thereof—of serological responses. CONCLUSION: The advantages of the newly developed tool for assessing the antigen profiles of serological responses may ultimately lead to the identification of biomarkers associated with various disease stages and or protection against disease.","Bolton, Jessica S.; Chaudhury, Sidhartha; Dutta, Sheetij; Gregory, Scott; Locke, Emily; Pierson, Tony; Bergmann-Leitner, Elke S.",Malar J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7165447/,16
10332,Community-Acquired Pneumonia in the Asia-Pacific Region,2016-12-11,"Enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) is a member of the species Enterovirus D in the genus Enterovirus of the Picornaviridae family. EV-D68 was first isolated in the United States in 1962 and is primarily an agent of respiratory disease. Infections with EV-D68 have been rarely reported until recently, when reports of EV-D68 associated with respiratory disease increased notably worldwide. An outbreak in 2014 in the United States, for example, involved more than 1,000 cases of severe respiratory disease that occurred across almost all states. Phylogenetic analysis of all EV-D68 sequences indicates that the circulating strains of EV-D68 can be classified into two lineages, lineage 1 and lineage 2. In contrast to the prototype Fermon strain, all circulating strains have deletions in their genomes. Respiratory illness associated with EV-D68 infection ranges from mild illness that just needs outpatient service to severe illness requiring intensive care and mechanical ventilation. To date, there are no specific medicines and vaccines to treat or prevent EV-D68 infection. This review provides a detailed overview about our current understanding of EV-D68-related virology, epidemiology and clinical syndromes, pathogenesis, and laboratory diagnostics.","Xiang, Zichun; Wang, Jianwei",Semin Respir Crit Care Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7171721/,16
10872,Pulmonary complications associated with veno-arterial extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation: a comprehensive review,2020-05-11,"BACKGROUND: Predicting successful liberation from mechanical ventilation (MV) in critically ill patients is challenging. Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) has been proposed to help guide decision-making for readiness to liberate from MV following a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT). METHODS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized and prospective observational studies that measured BNP levels at the time of SBT in patients receiving MV. The primary endpoint was successful liberation from MV (absence of reintubation or non-invasive ventilation at 48 h). Statistical analyses included bi-variate and Moses-Littenberg models and DerSimonian-Laird pooling of areas under ROC curve (AUROC). RESULTS: A total of 731 articles were screened. Eighteen adult and 2 pediatric studies were fulfilled pre-specified eligibility. The measure of the relative variation of BNP during SBT (ΔBNP%) after exclusion of SBT failure by clinical criteria in adults yielded a sensitivity and specificity of 0.889 [0.831–0.929] and 0.828 [0.730–0.896] for successful liberation from MV, respectively, with a pooled AUROC of 0.92 [0.88–0.97]. The pooled AUROC for any method of analysis for absolute variation of BNP (ΔBNP), pre-SBT BNP, and post-SBT BNP were 0.89 [0.83–0.95], 0.77 [0.63–0.91], and 0.85 [0.80–0.90], respectively. CONCLUSION: The relative change in BNP during a SBT has potential value as an incremental tool after successful SBT to predict successful liberation from MV in adults. There is insufficient data to support the use of BNP in children or as an alternate test to clinical indices of SBT, or the use of ΔBNP, BNP-pre, and BNP-post as an alternate or incremental test.

11043,Fast tracking after repair of congenital heart defects,2020-02-26,"In critically ill neurosurgical patients, delayed and premature extubation increases the risk of morbidity and mortality. Assessment of critically ill patients before and during spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) is crucial in predicting weaning failure. We explored the trend of changes with integrated lung and cardiac ultrasonography in predicting success of weaning in neurosurgical patients. Lung ultrasound and cardiac ultrasound was performed before and after 30 min and 120 min of SBT. Lung ultrasound score (LUS, range 0–36) was calculated using a predefined method of assessment of six chest regions on either side. The left ventricular function was evaluated by measuring fractional area change. The maximum velocities of mitral inflow E and A waves (E/A), deceleration time of E wave (DTE) and tissue doppler based E′ wave at lateral annulus to calculate E/E′, were measured to assess left ventricular filling pressure. Twenty seven patients underwent SBT, among these 22 had success and five had failure of SBT. The SBT failure group had higher baseline LUS and progressively higher LUS during SBT compared to the success group, suggesting significant lung de-recruitment. There was significant increase in the LV filling pressure (increase E/A and E/E′, decrease in DTE) after 30 and 120 min of SBT in failure group compared to the success group. Point of care lung and cardiac ultrasonography may be useful in detecting cardiopulmonary changes induced by SBT. Higher lung aeration loss and LV filling pressure were observed with SBT failure group.","Sachin, Sasidharan; Chakrabarti, Dhritiman; Gopalakrishna, Kadarapura Nanjundaiah; Bharadwaj, Suparna",J Clin Monit Comput,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7222928/,16

METHODS: As part of the European project EPICE on evidence-based perinatal care, we carried out semi-structured interviews (N = 44) with medical and nursing staff from 11 randomly selected neonatal intensive care units in 6 countries. The interviews focused on the most recent clinical or organizational change in the unit relevant to the care of very preterm infants. Thematic analysis was performed using verbatim transcripts of recorded interviews. RESULTS: Reported changes concerned ventilation, feeding and nutrition, neonatal sepsis, infant care, pain management and care of parents. Six categories of drivers to change were identified: availability of new knowledge or technology; guidelines or regulations from outside the unit; need to standardize practices; participation in research; occurrence of adverse events; and wish to improve care. Innovations originating within the unit, linked to the availability of new technology and seen to provide clear benefit for patients were more likely to achieve consensus and rapid implementation. CONCLUSIONS: Innovation can be initiated by several drivers that can impact on the success and sustainability of change.","Cuttini, Marina; Forcella, Emanuela; Rodrigues, Carina; Draper, Elizabeth S.; Martins, Ana F.; Lainé, Agnés; Willars, Janet; Hasselager, Asbjørn; Maier, Rolf F.; Croci, Ileana; Bonet, Mercedes; Zeitlin, Jennifer",Pediatr Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223325/,16
11944,Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation Resource Planning in the Setting of Pandemic Respiratory Illness,2020-07-11,"BACKGROUND: Carbapenem-resistant hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae strains have recently come into existence worldwide; however, researchers in northeast China are not aware of their clinical features and molecular characteristics. METHODS: Here, the molecular and virulent characteristics of 44 carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae (CRKP) isolates collected from January 2015 to December 2017 were studied. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) were carried out to define the clonal relatedness among the isolates. PCR and capsular serotyping of the virulence-associated genes, as well as biofilm formation and serum complement-mediated killing assays, were employed to determine the virulent potential. The genomic features and associated mobile genetic elements of JmsCRE57 were detected by whole genome sequencing. RESULTS: The only positive isolate was JmsCRE57, which belonged to the ST375 serotype K2 that expressed uge, mrkD, fimH, kpn, aerobactin and rmpA virulence-associated genes and showed strong biofilm formation and serum sensitivity. Sequencing results showed that the JmsCRE57 genome mainly consisted of a circular chromosome, three antimicrobial resistant plasmids and a virulent plasmid. The antimicrobial resistant plasmid expressing bla(KPC-2), bla(CTX-M-15), aph(3″)-Ib, aph(6)-Id, qnrB1, aac(3)-IIa, aac(6′)-Ib-cr, bla(OXA-1), bla(TEM-1B), catB4, sul2, dfrA14 and bla(SHV-99). The virulent plasmid belonged to the IncHI1B group, which is mainly composed of mucoid phenotype genes and siderophore-associated genes. The remaining CRKP strains that expressed uge, fimH, mrkD and kpn virulence-associated genes were not successfully typed. CONCLUSION: Our results provide new insights on the epidemiology of carbapenem-resistant K2 hypervirulent K. pneumoniae ST375 and CRKP ST76 strains in northeast China, which may help control their future outbreaks.","Su, Shanshan; Zhang, Jisheng; Zhao, Yongxin; Yu, Lan; Wang, Yong; Wang, Yuchao; Bao, Mingjia; Fu, Yu; Li, Chunjiang; Zhang, Xiaoli",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7331116/,16
15841,Prone Positioning of Patients during Venovenous Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation,2021-03-11,"In recent years, the role of human microbiota as a short- and long-term health promoter and modulator has been affirmed and progressively strengthened. In the course of one’s life, each subject is colonized by a great number of bacteria, which constitute its specific and individual microbiota. Human bacterial colonization starts during fetal life, in opposition to the previous paradigm of the “sterile womb”. Placenta, amniotic fluid, cord blood and fetal tissues each have their own specific microbiota, influenced by maternal health and habits and having a decisive influence on pregnancy outcome and offspring outcome. The maternal microbiota, especially that colonizing the genital system, starts to influence the outcome of pregnancy already before conception, modulating fertility and the success rate of fertilization, even in the case of assisted reproduction techniques. During the perinatal period, neonatal microbiota seems influenced by delivery mode, drug administration and many other conditions. Special attention must be reserved for early neonatal nutrition, because breastfeeding allows the transmission of a specific and unique lactobiome able to modulate and positively affect the neonatal gut microbiota. Our narrative review aims to investigate the currently identified pre- and peri-natal factors influencing neonatal microbiota, before conception, during pregnancy, pre- and post-delivery, since the early microbiota influences the whole life of each subject.","Coscia, Alessandra; Bardanzellu, Flaminia; Caboni, Elisa; Fanos, Vassilios; Peroni, Diego Giampietro",Life (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7920069/,16

This retrospective study was performed to evaluate whether plasma BNP level can predict treatment response to ibuprofen in preterm infants born at <30 weeks of gestation with hsPDA. Plasma BNP was measured before (baseline) and 12 to 24 h after (post-treatment) completion of the first (IBU1) and second (IBU2) course of ibuprofen. We compared the BNP levels of responders (closed or insignificant PDA) with those of non-responders (hsPDA requiring further pharmacologic or surgical closure) to each course of ibuprofen. The treatment response rates for IBU1 (n = 92) and IBU2 (n = 19) were 74% and 26%, respectively. In IBU1, non-responders had lower gestational age and birth weight than responders (both, P = 0.004), while in IBU2, non-responders had lower birth weight (P = 0.014) and platelet counts (P = 0.005) than responders; however, baseline BNP levels did not differ significantly between responders and non-responders in either IBU1 (median 1,434 vs. 1,750 pg/mL) or IBU2 (415 vs. 596 pg/mL). Post-treatment BNP was a useful marker for monitoring treatment efficacy of IBU1 and IBU2 for hsPDA with a cut-off value of 331 pg/mL (P < 0.001) and 423 pg/mL(P < 0.010), respectively. We did not identify a cut-off baseline BNP level that could predict treatment response to ibuprofen in preterm infants with hsPDA.","Oh, Seong Hee; Lee, Byong Sop; Jung, Euiseok; Oh, Moon Yeon; Do, Hyun-Jeong; Kim, Ellen Ai-Rhan; Kim, Ki-Soo",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7064477/,16

32431,Commentary: Primum non nocere,2020-05-12,"With the advances of graph analytics, preserving privacy in publishing graph data becomes an important task. However, graph data is highly sensitive to structural changes. Perturbing graph data for achieving differential privacy inevitably leads to inject a large amount of noise and the utility of anonymized graphs is severely limited. In this paper, we propose a microaggregation-based framework for graph anonymization which meets the following requirements: (1) The topological structures of an original graph can be preserved at different levels of granularity; (2) [Formula: see text]-differential privacy is guaranteed for an original graph through adding controlled perturbation to its edges (i.e., edge privacy); (3) The utility of graph data is enhanced by reducing the magnitude of noise needed to achieve [Formula: see text]-differential privacy. Within the proposed framework, we further develop a simple yet effective microaggregation algorithm under a distance constraint. We have empirically verified the noise reduction and privacy guarantee of our proposed algorithm on three real-world graph datasets. The experiments show that our proposed framework can significantly reduce noise added to achieve [Formula: see text]-differential privacy over graph data, and thus enhance the utility of anonymized graphs.","Iftikhar, Masooma; Wang, Qing; Lin, Yu",Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206283/,16

However, one can consider the role of stress when examining the relationship between health situations and decision-making ability, and by proxy health literacy. The aim of this study was to assess the strength of the evidence on the relationship between health situations and patient stress, considered in the context of health professional perception, and determine what health situations act to influence patient stress. METHODS: A systematic review of English articles using PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL and Embase databases was conducted. Search terms focused on ‘patient’, ‘stress’, and ‘health care situations’. Only peer-reviewed original research with data on patient stress in the context of a health facility environment was included. Studies were screened and critically appraised by both authors. Study elements for extraction were defined by RO and extracted by JY. RESULTS: Twenty-four studies were included for narrative synthesis. Patients in Intensive Care Units were more stressed about factors relating to their physical discomfort, with some agreement from health care professionals. Parents of children in Intensive Care Units were more concerned with stressors relating to their child’s appearance and behaviour, and alteration in their parental role. Few studies examined health settings other than Intensive Care Units, and those that did varied greatly in terms of study design and population characteristics, lacking generalisability. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the findings of what patients find most stressful in Intensive Care Units can guide health care professionals practicing best practice care. However, the evidence on how patient stress is influenced by non-Intensive Care Unit health care settings is weak. Further research is needed to enhance current understanding of the interaction between patient stress and health care environments in both hospital and primary care settings.","Yeh, John; Ostini, Remo",BMC Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7245697/,16

Combination antiviral therapy with repurposed broad-spectrum antiviral agents holds a highly promising immediate treatment strategy, especially given uncertainties of vaccine efficacy and developmental timeline. Here, we describe a novel hypothetical approach: combining available broad-spectrum antiviral agents such as nucleoside analogs with potential inhibitors of NendoU, for example nsp15 RNA substrate mimetics. While only hypothesis-generating, this approach may constitute a ‘double-hit’ whereby two CoV-unique protein elements of the replicase–transcriptase complex are inhibited simultaneously; this may be an Achilles' heel and precipitate lethal mutagenesis in a coronavirus.

The aim of the present study was to provide a systematic review of the updated knowledge regarding the molecular mechanisms underlying the toxicity of synthetic opioids, cannabinoids, cathinones, and stimulants. The study was conducted on the PubMed database. Study eligibility criteria included relevance to the topic, English language, and time of publication (2010–2020). A combined Mesh and free-text protocols search was performed. Study selection was performed on the title/abstract and, in doubtful cases, on the full texts of papers. Of the 580 records identified through PubMed searching and reference checking, 307 were excluded by title/abstract and 78 additional papers were excluded after full-text reading, leaving a total of 155 included papers. Molecular mechanisms of synthetic opioids, synthetic cannabinoids, stimulants, psychedelics, and hallucinogens were reviewed and mostly involved both a receptor-mediated and non-receptor mediated cellular modulation with multiple neurotransmitters interactions. The molecular mechanisms underlying the action of NPS are more complex than expected, with a wide range of overlap among activated receptors and neurotransmitter systems. The peculiar action profile of single compounds does not necessarily reflect that of the structural class to which they belong, accounting for possible unexpected toxic reactions.","Giorgetti, Arianna; Pascali, Jennifer P.; Fais, Paolo; Pelletti, Guido; Gabbin, Andrea; Franchetti, Giorgia; Cecchetto, Giovanni; Viel, Guido",Life (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8156937/,16

The study was conducted through an anonymous questionnaire proposed to a group of 102 refugees. The results confirmed that by increasing the sense of belonging to the Italian community, the time refugees spent on digital communication negatively associated with their psychological distress and positively associated with their wellbeing. Refugees’ access to digital communication also increased their health-related risk perception that in turn raised their psychological distress. It specifically occurred when digital communication has been perceived as less affordable, i.e. as less clear, easy and reassuring.

Answering this question has been the subject of much debate in the popular press, the policy community, and scholarly circles. That asked, it is worth remembering that scholars and policymakers have long argued that one of the most enduring and important aspects of the US role in the world is American structural power. Perhaps nowhere has the Trump administration's approach to world affairs been more notable in perhaps diminishing US structural power than in withdrawing from multilateral forums. On an individual level of analysis, however, Trump's ever-changing, whiplash style of leadership made allies and adversaries less certain about American actions, intentions, and the direction of future policy trajectories. These issues point to the possibility that such impacts were more about Trump being Trump and less about a decline in American structural power. Only time will tell whether President Biden is able to rebuild from that structural wreckage. With these ideas in mind, the forum editors asked scholars representing diverse voices and perspectives to provide varying analyses of America First, specifically in light of the emergence of multiple global challenges from the COVID-19 pandemic to racial reckoning through the climate crisis and more.

57456,Should high-flow through nasal cannula be used during bronchoscopy in critically ill patients with hypoxemic acute respiratory failure?,2021-09-04,"Unlearning has evinced immense traction and opportunity in debates pertaining to organizational learning, innovation, management of change, knowledge management, and new product development, to name but a few. Provided the diversity and expansiveness of the phenomenon, past studies have undertaken both narrative and systematic reviews to synthesize the field of organizational unlearning (OU). Although highly commendable and enlightening, these scholarly efforts would be augmented by contemplating the share of leading management journals towards furthering the research on unlearning. Moreover, a systematic comprehension of the research themes of OU can be instrumental in representing the intellectual structure of the field. For this purpose, we undertake a combination of bibliometric and thematic analysis to identify critical trends that have helped shape unlearning research. The results discern the main scientific actors (articles, authors, journals, universities), research design, and dimensions of OU. In addition, eight clusters of unlearning along with underlying theoretical perspectives are analyzed, which may help scholars integrate the development of one domain to another, formulate pertinent research questions related to OU, and encourage interdisciplinary research.","Sharma, Shubham; Lenka, Usha",Rev Manag Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8412863/,16
57919,Lung transplantation: how we do it,2021-09-18,"BACKGROUND: Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a complex multi-symptom disease with widespread evidence of disrupted systems. The authors hypothesize that it is caused by the upregulation of the corticotropin-releasing factor receptor type 2 (CRFR2) in the raphé nuclei and limbic system, which impairs the ability to maintain homeostasis. The authors propose utilizing agonist-mediated receptor endocytosis to downregulate CRFR2. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This open-label trial tested the safety, tolerability and efficacy of an acute dose of CT38s (a short-lived, CRFR2-selective agonist, with no known off-target activity) in 14 ME/CFS patients. CT38s was subcutaneously-infused at one of four dose-levels (i.e., infusion rates of 0.01, 0.03, 0.06, and 0.20 μg/kg/h), for a maximum of 10.5 h. Effect was measured as the pre-/post-treatment change in the mean 28-day total daily symptom score (TDSS), which aggregated 13 individual patient-reported symptoms. RESULTS: ME/CFS patients were significantly more sensitive to the transient hemodynamic effects of CRFR2 stimulation than healthy subjects in a prior trial, supporting the hypothesized CRFR2 upregulation. Adverse events were generally mild, resolved without intervention, and difficult to distinguish from ME/CFS symptoms, supporting a CRFR2 role in the disease. The acute dose of CT38s was associated with an improvement in mean TDSS that was sustained (over at least 28 days post-treatment) and correlated with both total exposure and pre-treatment symptom severity. At an infusion rate of 0.03 μg/kg/h, mean TDSS improved by −7.5 ± 1.9 (or −25.7%, p = 0.009), with all monitored symptoms improving. CONCLUSION: The trial supports the hypothesis that CRFR2 is upregulated in ME/CFS, and that acute CRFR2 agonism may be a viable treatment approach warranting further study.

70891,Successful management of severe unilateral re-expansion pulmonary edema after mitral valve repair with mini-thoracotomy using extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.,2017,"INTRODUCTION German government regulations such as physical distancing and limited group numbers, designed to curb the spread of COVID-19, have had far-reaching consequences for the very foundations of social life. They have, to name only a few, transformed greetings and goodbyes, blurred private and public worlds, and complicated basic communication with mandatory mask wearing. The ethnographic study CoronaCare investigates how these sociopolitical measures affect social health, a form of health which unfolds through and across social relations. It explores how caring as a fundamental human activity and one integral to sustaining social health is impacted when in-person and person-to-person contacts are restricted and everyone is radically redefined as at risk from others and a risk to others. It explores care relationships, relationships involving the giving or receiving of care in everyday life, institutional settings such as an assisted living facility, and informal settings, such as a housing block. Inside of the pandemic, relationships are a pivotal site at which the negotiation of caring and risk is intensified and where the consequences for social health and social life more generally are pronounced. METHODS AND ANALYSIS This ethnographic project aims to understand the tensions that arise in the lives of individuals and communities living under the sociopolitical regulations and to analyse the tacit forms of practice that individuals and communities develop to uphold social health. Fueled by citizen science, the ethnography uses a variety of methods namely telephone and video interviews with 60-70 research participants, the collection of ethnographic material including video and audio diaries, storyboards, first-person camera footage, photographs and a survey to enrich the sample description based on the Copenhagen Psychosocial Questionnaire. The analysis will draw on elements of grounded theory and through the aid of the qualitative software MAXQDA it will rigorously document and explain how the social regulations are (re)shaping our ability to be cared for and to care for one another. The survey data will be analysed through the use of the quantitative software programme R. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION The ethics committee of the Brandenburg Medical School Theodor Fontane has approved the project (E-01-20200605). The dissemination strategy includes publications in medical, sociological and research methods journals, as well as a stakeholder discussion with political and civil society leaders where the research team will present its recommendations for future pandemic preparedness.","Paul, Joshua; Merz, Sibille; Bergholz, Andreas; König, Franziska; Apfelbacher, Christian; Eich-Krohm, Astrid; Weigt, Julia; Holmberg, Christine",BMJ open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-048212; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34645659/,16

Methods: Retrospective reviews and case series were examined to provide an overview of the management of viral infections in the burn patient. Results: The most common viral pathogens in these patients are the herpesviruses, which include herpes simplex, varicella zoster, cytomegalovirus, and human herpesvirus 6. Established viral infections that may complicate patient management include human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B and C, and, more recently, the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Herpesvirus infections can occur as primary or nosocomial pathogens but clinical manifestations most commonly are re-activation of latent viral infection. Because of the paucity of data in the burn population, much of the evidence for specific treatments is extrapolated from patients with severe immunosuppression or critical illness. Antiviral therapy is employed for the burn patient with herpesvirus infections. This is an area of active study, and further research is needed to better understand the risks, clinical manifestations, and attributable morbidity and mortality of viral infections. Conclusions: Major burn injury results in immunosuppression and viral infection in a small number of patients. Recognition and antiviral therapy are employed, but additional studies are necessary to improve outcomes in these patients.","Kiley, John L; Chung, Kevin K; Blyth, Dana M",Surgical infections,https://doi.org/10.1089/sur.2020.130; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32460632/,16

The aim of the study was to evaluate differences in EBT between periods of controlled disease and during exacerbations in children with virus-induced asthma. METHODS Twenty-nine children (aged 6-14 years) with a history of intermittent, virus-induced asthma were included in this case-control study. Cases presented with a common cold and/or mild exacerbation of asthma, while controls were free of asthmatic or common cold symptoms during the previous 6 weeks. A baseline questionnaire was obtained. Atopy assessment, central temperature and a spirometric measurement were recorded. EBT was measured with a new device (Delmedica, Singapore). A nasal wash (for identification of common respiratory viruses) was obtained. RESULTS Twenty-four children (12 from each group) completed the study. Groups were homogeneous with respect to baseline characteristics. PCR revealed the presence of a virus in 3 out of 17 controls and 10 out of 12 cases (17.6 and 83.3%, respectively, p = 0.002). The most commonly identified virus was rhinovirus (3/3 controls and 7/10 cases, p = 0.02). EBT values were significantly higher for cases (34.91 +/- 0.62 degrees C) compared to controls (34.18 +/- 1.1 degrees C, p = 0.032). No important differences were observed in the increase rate of EBT (Deltae degrees T) between groups. CONCLUSIONS Changes in airway inflammation during virus-induced asthma exacerbations are reflected in EBT changes. These preliminary data suggest a possible role of EBT measurements in the assessment of airway inflammation in children with virus-induced asthma.","Xepapadaki, P; Xatziioannou, A; Chatzicharalambous, M; Makrinioti, H; Papadopoulos, N G",International archives of allergy and immunology,https://doi.org/10.1159/000301581; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20357487/,16

It is important to learn from this to inform mental healthcare during future crises. METHOD A lexical analysis was conducted of clinician reflections during COVID-19 as they delivered psychiatry services to children and families in New South Wales (n = 6) and transitioned to e-mental health. RESULTS E-mental health can extend the reach of, and access to psychiatry services, particularly for individuals disadvantaged by inequity. Yet e-mental health can be problematic. It is partly contingent on technological prowess, equipment, internet access as well as space and privacy. Relatedly, e-mental health can hinder clinician capacity to conduct examinations, monitor child development as well as assess risk and the need for child protection. CONCLUSIONS Given the benefits and limitations of e-mental health, a model that supports face-to-face mental healthcare and e-mental health may be of value. This model would require practical, yet flexible policies and protocols that protect the privacy of children and families, safeguard them from harm, and respect the needs and preferences of children, families and clinicians.","Eapen, Valsamma; Dadich, Ann; Balachandran, Srilaxmi; Dani, Anitha; Howari, Rasha; Sequeria, Anupama Zeena; Singer, Joel D",Australasian psychiatry : bulletin of Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists,https://doi.org/10.1177/10398562211022748; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34126787/,16
80058,PRO: Perioperative Goal-Directed Fluid Therapy Is an Essential Element of an Enhanced Recovery Protocol.,2016,"Most respirators employed in health care settings, and often in first responder and industrial settings, are intended for single-use: the user dons the respirator, performs a work activity, and then doffs and discards the respirator. However, in the current COVID-19 pandemic, in the presence of persistent shortages of personal protective equipment, extended use and reuse of filtering facepiece respirators are routinely contemplated by many health care organizations. Further, there is considerable current effort to understand the effect of sterilization on the possibility of reuse, and some investigations of performance have been conducted. While the ability of such a respirator to continue to provide effective protection after repeated sanitization cycles is a critical component of implementing its reuse, of equal importance is an understanding of the impact that reusing the respirator multiple times in a day while performing work tasks, and even extending its wear over multiple days, has on the workplace protective performance. In this study, we subjected a stockpiled quantitatively fitted surgical style N95 filtering facepiece respirator device to extreme reuse and extended wear conditions (up to 19 uses over a duration of 5 days) and measured its protective performance at regular intervals, including simulated workplace protection factor measurements using total inward leakage. With this respirator, it was shown to be possible to maintain protection corresponding to an assigned protection factor greater than 10 under extreme usage conditions provided an individual is properly trained in the use of, and expertly fitted in, the respirator. Other factors such as hygiene and strap breakage are likely to place limits on reuse.","Duncan, Scott; Bodurtha, Paul; Bourgeois, Cara; Dickson, Eva; Jensen, Cheryl; Naqvi, Syed",Journal of occupational and environmental hygiene,https://doi.org/10.1080/15459624.2020.1829633; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33166226/,16

87533,Feasibility of bedside open lung biopsy in patients treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.,2014,"BACKGROUND Endovascular treatment of large complex morphology aneurysms is challenging. High recanalization rates have been reported with techniques such as stent-assisted coiling and balloon-assisted coiling. Flow diverter devices have been introduced to improve efficacy outcomes and recanalization rates. Thromboembolic complications and in-device stenosis are certainly more worrisome when treatment of bilateral internal carotid arteries has been performed. This study aimed to report our experience with mid-term imaging follow-up of staged bilateral Pipeline embolization device placement for the treatment of bilateral internal carotid artery aneurysms. METHODS We reviewed the clinical, angiographic, and follow-up imaging data in all consecutive patients treated with bilateral internal carotid artery aneurysms who underwent elective Pipeline embolization. RESULTS Six female patients were treated, harboring a total of 13 aneurysms. Of these, 60% were asymptomatic. Diplopia and headache were the most common symptoms. The most common location was the paraclinoid segment (6/13), including by cavernous segment (4/13) and ophthalmic segment (2/13). Successful delivery of the device was achieved in 12 cases. Difficult distal access precluded the deployment of the device in one case. The treatment was always staged with at least eight weeks' difference between the two procedures. All aneurysm necks were covered completely. There were no periprocedural complications. Angiographic follow-up ranged between 3 and 12 months, and computed tomography angiogram follow-up ranged between 2 and 24 months. Complete aneurysm occlusion was achieved in all cases. CONCLUSION In our series, Pipeline deployment for the treatment of bilateral internal carotid artery aneurysms in a staged fashion is safe and feasible. Mid-term imaging follow-up showed permanent occlusion of all the treated aneurysms.","Tejada, Juan G; Lopez, Gloria Vv; Koovor, Jerry Me; Riley, Kalen; Martinez, Mesha","Interventional neuroradiology : journal of peritherapeutic neuroradiology, surgical procedures and related neurosciences",https://doi.org/10.1177/1591019919853586; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31159632/,16
87556,Positive end-expiratory airway pressure does not aggravate ventilator-induced diaphragmatic dysfunction in rabbits.,2014,"BACKGROUND Outcome postponement has been proposed as an effect measure for preventive drug treatment. It describes the average delay of the investigated unwanted clinical event, achieved by taking medication. The objective was to estimate postponement of death for the following heart failure medications compared to placebo: Beta-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme - inhibitors (ACE inhibitors), angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB), ARB added to ACE-inhibitors, aldosterone-antagonists, ivabradine, and renin-antagonists. METHODS We searched Medline and Embase from inception of databases until October 2017. Eligibility criteria were randomized placebo-controlled heart failure trials, including at least 1000 participants, with survival as a prespecified outcome and a minimum trial duration of 1 year. We calculated the outcome postponement by modeling the area between survival curves. This area was modeled on the basis of the hazard ratio or relative risk, the rate of mortality in the placebo group, and the trial duration. All results were standardized to a 3-year trial duration to ensure comparability between treatments. RESULTS We identified 14 eligible trials, with a total of 52,014 patients. The results in terms of postponement of all-cause mortality was: beta-blockers 43.7 days (95% confidence interval (95% CI), 20.8 - 66.5), ACE-inhibitors 41.0 days (95% CI, 18.8 - 63.3) and aldosterone-antagonists 41.3 days (95% CI, 14.3 - 68.4). CONCLUSION The modeled outcome postponement estimates reiterate ACE-inhibitors, beta-blockers, and aldosterone antagonists as the mainstay of heart failure treatment.

Our objective was to test a fully automated closed-loop control (CLC) system in the absence of announcement of carbohydrate ingestion among adolescents with T1D, who are known to commonly omit meal announcement. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Eighteen adolescents with T1D (age 15.6 ± 1.7 years; HbA1c 7.4 ± 1.5%; 9 females/9 males) participated in a randomized crossover clinical trial comparing our legacy hybrid CLC system (Unified Safety System Virginia [USS]-Virginia) with a novel fully automated CLC system (RocketAP) during two 46-h supervised admissions (each with one announced and one unannounced dinner), following 2 weeks of data collection. Primary outcome was the percentage time-in-range 70-180 mg/dL (TIR) following the unannounced meal, with secondary outcomes related to additional continuous glucose monitoring-based metrics. RESULTS Both TIR and time-in-tight-range 70-140 mg/dL (TTR) were significantly higher using RocketAP than using USS-Virginia during the 6 h following the unannounced meal (83% [interquartile range 64-93] vs. 53% [40-71]; P = 0.004 and 49% [41-59] vs. 27% [22-36]; P = 0.002, respectively), primarily driven by reduced time-above-range (TAR >180 mg/dL: 17% [1.3-34] vs. 47% [28-60]), with no increase in time-below-range (TBR <70 mg/dL: 0% median for both). RocketAP also improved control following the announced meal (mean difference TBR: -0.7%, TIR: +7%, TTR: +6%), overall (TIR: +5%, TAR: -5%, TTR: +8%), and overnight (TIR: +7%, TTR: +19%, TAR: -5%). RocketAP delivered less insulin overall (78 ± 23 units vs. 85 ± 20 units, P = 0.01).

METHODS Patients with COVID-19 were classified into 4 groups according to symptom. The study traced the onset and duration of symptoms, compared laboratory examinations and conducted bioinformatic analysis. Immune indices were further analyzed. RESULTS By March 16, 25 patients with COVID-19 and 13 with suspect COVID-19 were admitted to West China Hospital, Sichuan University. Digestive system symptom group had the highest level of ESR (mm/h, P＜0.0001), serum ferritin (ng/ml, P＜0.0001), hepatic enzymes (P＜0.05), and retentive lymphocyte count/percentage (P＜0.05) and its subsets (P＜0.05). Combined group (respiratory combined with subsequent digestive system symptom) had the highest level of IL-6 (pg/ml, P=0.0046), CRP (mg/L, P=0.0004) and moderate lymphocyte depletion. Respiratory system symptom and asymptomatic groups suffered the most from lymphocyte depletion (P＜0.05).

The impact of the pandemic and knowledge of obesity as a risk factor on the lived experience of people with obesity is not fully understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on people living with severe obesity (BMI ≥35 kg/m2 ), currently engaged in multi-modal treatment. The primary objectives were to examine the impact of the pandemic on their lived experience from a treatment and psychosocial standpoint and additionally explore their awareness of obesity as a risk factor for COVID-19 disease severity. An in-depth qualitative study was adopted employing semi-structured interviews with open-ended questions.

However, the impact of specific workflow intervals is not clear. METHODS We studied the mechanical thrombectomy group (n=103) of the prospective, randomized REVASCAT (Randomized Trial of Revascularization With Solitaire FR Device Versus Best Medical Therapy in the Treatment of Acute Stroke due to Anterior Circulation Large Vessel Occlusion Presenting Within Eight Hours of Symptom Onset) trial. We defined 3 workflow metrics: time from symptom onset to reperfusion (OTR), time from symptom onset to computed tomography, and time from computed tomography (CT) to reperfusion. Clinical characteristics, core laboratory-evaluated Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Scores (ASPECTS) and 90-day outcome data were analyzed. The effect of time on favorable outcome (modified Rankin scale, 0-2) was described via adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for every 30-minute delay. RESULTS Median admission National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale was 17.0 (14.0-20.0), reperfusion rate was 66%, and rate of favorable outcome was 43.7%. Mean (SD) workflow times were as follows: OTR: 342 (107) minute, onset to CT: 204 (93) minute, and CT to reperfusion: 138 (56) minute. Longer OTR time was associated with a reduced likelihood of good outcome (OR for 30-minute delay, 0.74; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.59-0.93). The onset to CT time did not show a significant association with clinical outcome (OR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.67-1.12), whereas the CT to reperfusion interval showed a negative association with favorable outcome (OR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.54-0.95). A similar subgroup analysis according to admission ASPECTS showed this relationship for OTR time in ASPECTS<8 patients (OR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.35-0.9) but not in ASPECTS≥8 (OR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.68-1.44). CONCLUSIONS Time to reperfusion is negatively associated with favorable outcome, being CT to reperfusion, as opposed to onset to CT, the main determinant of this association. In addition, OTR was strongly associated to outcome in patients with low ASPECTS scores but not in patients with high ASPECTS scores. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

Notably there has been a significant increase in the use of digital technology applications to meet this challenge. For instance, in the first quarter of 2020 the game-based software Kahoot! reported a threefold increase in players and a fivefold increase in asynchronous learning globally. However, there is limited research into the use of game-based digital technology applications such as Kahoot! and the associated learning theories, particularly in histology, anatomy and medical education. This scoping review explored the utilization, outcome scores and student perceptions of learning with the application of Kahoot! in histology, anatomy and medical education. Online databases were used to identify articles published between 2013 and 2021 from which 12 articles were included in the review. The majority of papers supported positive student outcomes including improved collaborative learning, improved knowledge of content, attendance, and participation. Minor negative aspects included increased time on task, overwhelming learning content and distractions due to gadgets. None of the papers included a control group. The main educational theories identified were active learning followed by social and constructivism learning theory. In light of the Covid-19 pandemic a rapid and fundamental shift in how digital applications are being used in educational institutions has evolved. Further research on learning frameworks and studies with control groups is required to evaluate Kahoot! as a potentially valuable online application in histology, anatomy and medical education.","Donkin, Rebecca; Rasmussen, Rosemary",Anatomical sciences education,https://doi.org/10.1002/ase.2094; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33900041/,16

110216,Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation for COVID-19.,2020-07-21,"The emergence of COVID-19 precipitated varied responses from public health officials in London, England. In April 2020, clinicians at 56 Dean Street sexual health and advice clinic in central London described social isolation as 'a unique window of opportunity' to 'break the chain' in HIV transmission. This was followed by critical responses within HIV prevention circles. Drawing from these responses, this article examines the implications of the clinic's 'Test Now, Stop HIV' campaign by asking how has the early COVID-19 pandemic reshaped institutional responses and strategies to end HIV transmission in England? We assess how campaign messages developed between April and May 2020. We analyse materials related to the campaign, including the clinic's Twitter account, the campaign website, and journalism in mainstream media. Based on this information, we discuss three themes: testing and issues of access; the biopolitics of testing; and the idealism of quarantine. We draw on sociology, cultural theory and science and technology studies to describe how the 'end of HIV' was constructed through the link between COVID-19 and HIV. We suggest the campaign reinscribes historical perceptions of abstinence and quarantine as idealised HIV prevention strategies, and thus fails to address safer sex in the time of Coronavirus.","Ledin, Chase; Weil, Benjamin","Culture, health & sexuality",https://doi.org/10.1080/13691058.2021.1906953; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33792509/,16

The presence of parvovirus in chickens with enteric disease was investigated in commercial flocks in Brazil. 2. The intestinal contents of chickens exhibiting clinical signs of diarrhoea, weight loss or mortality were examined, and chicken parvovirus (chPV) was identified using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. The samples were sequenced and inoculated into specific-pathogen-free (SPF) embryonated eggs to isolate the virus. 3. Necropsies showed that the embryos were dwarfish, haemorrhagic and oedematous. The presence of chPV was confirmed by PCR and DNA sequencing. 4. The molecular characterisation of chPV strains circulating in the Brazilian flocks showed that they were genetically related to sequences from North America, Europe and Asia. Phylogenetic analyses clustered the Brazilian chPV sequences with those from Europe (Croatia, Hungary) and Asia (South Korea). 5. This study is the first report of the molecular characterisation of chPV circulating in the commercial flocks in Brazil and indicates high genetic similarity with chPV sequences from around the world.","Nuñez, L F N; Santander Parra, S H; Mettifogo, E; Astolfi-Ferreira, C S; Piantino Ferreira, A J",British poultry science,https://doi.org/10.1080/00071668.2014.981797; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25633520/,16

The purpose of this study was to undertake a single-center randomized controlled feasibility trial comparing a strategy of early endovascular aneurysm treatment with treatment after neurologic recovery in this group of patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients with poor-grade SAH were randomized within 24 hours of admission to early treatment or treatment after neurologic recovery. If a patient was randomized to early treatment, the aneurysm was treated endovascularly within 24 hours of randomization. Recruitment rate, safety profile, and functional outcome at the time of discharge and at 6 months were assessed. RESULTS Fourteen of 51 patients screened were eligible for the trial. Of these 14, 8 patients were randomized (57%). All patients in the early coiling arm received treatment within 24 hours of randomization. There was no treatment-related complication. Overall, good outcome occurred in 25% of patients; the mortality rate was 75%. Patients in the early treatment arm (n = 5) had a good outcome rate of 20%, while those in treatment after neurologic recovery arm (n = 3) had a good outcome rate of 33.3%. CONCLUSIONS This was a feasibility study that demonstrated that recruitment and randomization for comparing management strategies in poor-grade SAH are feasible. The recruitment rate among eligible patients was encouraging (57%), though a number of patients had to be excluded due to ineligibility. A multicenter study is necessary to recruit the numbers required to compare the clinical outcomes of these management strategies.","Mitra, D; Gregson, B; Jayakrishnan, V; Gholkar, A; Vincent, A; White, P; Mitchell, P",AJNR.

Gating modifier toxins from spider venom can modulate the gating mechanism of sodium channels and thus have potential as drug leads. Here, we established expression of the gating modifier toxin PaurTx-3, a sodium channel inhibitor found in the venom of the spider Phrixotrichus auratus. Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings indicated that recombinant PaurTx-3 (rPaurTx-3) inhibited Nav1.4, Nav1.5, and Nav1.7 currents with IC50 values of 61 nM, 72 nM, and 25 nM, respectively. Furthermore, rPaurTx-3 irreversibly inhibited Nav1.7 currents, but had 60-70% recovery in Nav1.4 and Nav1.5 after washing with a bath solution. rPaurTx-3 also hyperpolarized the voltage-dependent steady-state inactivation curve and significantly slowed recovery from fast inactivation of Nav1.7. Current-clamp recordings showed that rPaurTx-3 suppressed small DRG neuron activity. The biological activity assay findings for rPaurTx-3 support its potent pharmacological effect in Nav1.7 and small DRG neurons.","Chen, Minzhi; Peng, Shuijiao; Wang, Li; Yang, Li; Si, Yuxin; Zhou, Xi; Zhang, Yunxiao; Liu, Zhonghua",Biochemical and biophysical research communications,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.09.103; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33004176/,16

Background: The corona pandemic, caused by the novel viral disease COVID-19, has led to excessive strain in health professionals whose general occupational situation in itself is associated with high levels of stress. So far, there is no quantitative data on the stress experience caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in German health professionals and on the consequences of this experience for their commitment to work. METHOD With a cross-sectional design, German health professionals were asked about their stress experience, health concerns and work commitment. The snapshot survey used self-developed questions plus items of a validated scale measuring work engagement. A convenience sample of health professionals was recruited through social media. The E-Survey reached 1168 valid cases, the majority of which were nurses (80.4 %, n = 855). RESULTS The evaluation shows that health professionals in direct contact with COVID-19 patients show higher stress levels than participants with no contact and that their main concern is about the health of relatives, friends and family. In addition, it was found that the participants' work commitment decreased parallel to the increase in pandemic-related stress. DISCUSSION The study shows significant correlations between work demands, stress experience and work engagement. In contrast to earlier studies, the results for work engagement in the sample are relatively low. There is a growing number of international recommendations for reducing work-related stress factors in a pandemic which should now be implemented in Germany on a large scale. These include, amongst others, pandemic specific catalogues of prevention measures and the creation of a blame-free work environment.","Wildgruber, Domenika; Frey, Jana; Seer, Max; Pinther, Kristina; Koob, Clemens; Reuschenbach, Bernd",Pflege,https://doi.org/10.1024/1012-5302/a000759; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32996863/,16

Yet there is no systematic way for National Health Service (NHS) Trusts to record the frequency of investigations, and extremely little data on the long-term outcomes of such action for the doctors. The document-Maintaining High Professional Standards in the Modern NHS (a framework for the initial investigation of concerns about doctors and dentists in the NHS)-should protect doctors from facing unfair or mismanaged performance management procedures, which include conduct, capability and health. Equally, it provides NHS Trusts with a framework that must be adhered to when managing performance concerns regarding doctors. Yet, very few doctors have even heard of it or know about the provisions it contains for their protection, and the implementation of the framework appears to be very variable across NHS Trusts. By empowering all doctors with the knowledge of what performance management procedures exist and how best practice should be implemented, we aim to ensure that they are informed participants in any investigation should it occur.","Ataullah, Ifat; Livesey, Alexandra",Postgraduate medical journal,https://doi.org/10.1136/postgradmedj-2020-138851; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33008958/,16

Flow-diverting efficacy, by preserving flow through the parent artery, was approved for its use in unruptured cerebral aneurysms, but no consensus was reached on its use for BBAs ruptured in the acute setting. We report a multicenter experience of use of flow diversion in acute setting of ruptured BBA, to analyze the safety and efficacy of these devices. METHODS We performed a retrospective study of 6 consecutive intracranial BBAs treated with flow diverter devices (FDD) between 2018 and 2020 at 3 italian institutions. Materials, therapy used, complications, clinical and radiographic outcomes were reviewed. RESULTS We used different FDD, in all cases immediate change in contrast opacification at the end of the procedure was reported. Intraprocedural IIb/IIIa inhibitor agent was the major antiplatelet protocol administered. Any complications occurred. All patients showed complete BBA obliteration at 3 months follow-up. 5/6 patients achieved good clinical outcome (0-2 mRS) at 3 months, all of which were presented with low grade SAH (Hunt Hess I-III) and a lower Fisher grade.

We predicted that psychological detachment from work during the evening would be associated with changes in cognitive appraisal from afternoon to the next morning. Additionally, we predicted that these associations are mediated by state of being recovered in the morning. We collected data from 183 employees with 3 daily measurement occasions over 2 consecutive workweeks. We analyzed the data using multilevel path modeling with latent variance decomposition into within- and between-person variance parts. Results showed that psychological detachment predicted a decrease in hindrance and threat appraisal but no change in challenge appraisal from afternoon to morning. State of being recovered mediated the relationship between psychological detachment and threat appraisal but not hindrance appraisal. Psychological detachment was indirectly related to an increase in challenge appraisal via state of being recovered in the morning. Our results provide insights on predictors of cognitive appraisal and the role of recovery for cognitive processes in the stress process.

128665,"Public Messaging for Serious Illness Care in the Age of Coronavirus Disease: Cutting through Misconceptions, Mixed Feelings, and Distrust.",2021-02-25,"CONTEXT Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disproportionately impacts patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), especially those with kidney failure requiring replacement therapy (KFRT). Patients with KFRT have increased risk of developing COVID-19, and though initial reports suggested that mortality of these patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting is prohibitively high, those studies suffered from significant limitations. Subject of Review: The Study of the Treatment and Outcomes in Critically Ill Patients With COVID-19 (STOP-COVID) is a multicenter cohort study that enrolled adults with COVID-19 admitted to ICUs in 68 medical centers across the USA. STOP-COVID investigators compared characteristics at the time of ICU admission and clinical outcomes in 143 patients with KFRT, 521 with nondialysis-dependent CKD (ND-CKD), and 3,600 patients without CKD. Patients with KFRT were less likely to have typical COVID-19 symptoms but more likely to have altered mental status at the time of ICU admission and were less likely to require mechanical ventilation during hospitalization than those without kidney disease. Approximately, 50% of patients with KFRT and ND-CKD died within 28 days of ICU admission, and in fully adjusted models, patients with KFRT and ND-CKD had 1.41- and 1.25-fold higher risk of 28-day mortality than those without CKD. Patients with KFRT and ND-CKD were also less likely to receive emerging therapies for COVID-19 than those without CKD. Second Opinion: This study provides important new data demonstrating differences in clinical presentation in patients with KFRT and ND-CKD with COVID-19. Alhough patients with severe CKD had higher mortality than those without CKD, approximately half survived after 28 days, demonstrating that patients with COVID-19 and severe CKD can benefit from ICU care. The markedly lower use of emerging COVID-19 treatments in patients with severe CKD highlights the need to include these patients in clinical trials of new COVID-19 therapies and for clinicians to ensure equal access to care in patients with severe CKD and COVID-19.","Brogan, Maureen; Ross, Michael J",Nephron,https://doi.org/10.1159/000519530; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34634789/,16

METHODS We conducted an analysis of sustained SBP control and long-term nursing home admissions using data from the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) linked to Medicare claims restricted to participants with fee-for-service coverage, at least eight study visits with SBP measurements, who were not living in a nursing home during a 48-month baseline BP assessment period (n = 6557). Sustained SBP control was defined as less than 140 mmHg at less than 50%, 50% to less than 75%, 75% to less than 100%, and 100% of visits. Nursing home admissions were identified using the Medicare Long Term Care Minimum Data Set. RESULTS The mean age of participants was 73.8 years and 44.3% were men. Over a median follow-up of 9.2 years, 844 participants (12.8%) had a nursing home admission. Rates of nursing home admission per 100 person-years were 16.3 for participants with SBP control at less than 50%, 14.1 at 50% to less than 75%, 7.8 at 75% to less than 100%, and 5.3 at 100% of visits. Compared with those with sustained SBP control at less than 50% of visits, hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) for nursing home admission were 0.79 (0.66-0.93), 0.70 (0.58-0.84), and 0.57 (0.44-0.74) among participants with SBP control at 50% to less than 75%, 75% to less than 100%, and 100% of visits, respectively.

149576,A Novel Mobile Phone Application for Pulse Pressure Variation Monitoring Based on Feature Extraction Technology: A Method Comparison Study in a Simulated Environment.,2016,"The edible cyanobacterium Spirulina platensis and its chief biliprotein C-Phycocyanin have shown protective activity in animal models of diverse human health diseases, often reflecting antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. The beneficial effects of C-Phycocyanin seem likely to be primarily attributable to its covalently attached chromophore Phycocyanobilin (PCB). Within cells, biliverdin is generated from free heme and it is subsequently reduced to bilirubin. Although bilirubin can function as an oxidant scavenger, its potent antioxidant activity reflects its ability to inactivate some isoforms of NADPH oxidase. Free bilirubin can also function as an agonist for the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR); this may explain its ability to promote protective Treg activity in cellular and rodent models of inflammatory disease. AhR agonists also promote transcription of the gene coding for Nrf-2, and hence can up-regulate phase 2 induction of antioxidant enzymes such as HO-1. Hence, it is proposed that C-Phycocyanin/PCB chiefly exert their protective effects via inhibition of NADPH oxidase activity, as well as by AhR agonism that both induces Treg activity and up-regulates phase 2 induction. This simple model may explain their potent antioxidant/anti-inflammatory effects. Additionally, PCB might mimic biliverdin in activating anti-inflammatory signaling mediated by biliverdin reductase. This essay reviews recent research in which C-Phycocyanin and/or PCB, administered orally, parenterally, or intranasally, have achieved marked protective effects in rodent and cell culture models of Ischemic Stroke and Multiple Sclerosis, and suggests that these agents may likewise be protective for Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and in COVID-19 and its neurological complications.","Pentón-Rol, Giselle; Marín-Prida, Javier; McCarty, Mark F",Current neuropharmacology,https://doi.org/10.2174/1570159x19666210408123807; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33829974/,16

Thus, a well-structured questionnaire was administered based on an attitudinal scale and google form was used. The inclusion criteria were defined on the questionnaire such as an independent age bracket (18-60), resident of Pakistan, using social media, and literate. The response was stopped after reaching the sample at 1264 participants. The study findings reveal that social isolation, social distancing, and the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) had a significant positive impact on risk reduction of COVID-19 among individuals. Moreover, hand and respiratory hygienic along with the risk of infection also significantly contributing to minimizing the pandemic outbreak.","Shoaib, Muhammad; Abdullah, Farooq",Social work in public health,https://doi.org/10.1080/19371918.2020.1806172; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32811345/,16

152858,Severe acute respiratory infections in the postpandemic era of H1N1.,2012,"SCOPE 2- and 3-monochloropropanediol (2/3-MCPD) and glycidol are absorbed in the intestine after lipase-catalyzed hydrolysis of their fatty acid esters. METHODS AND RESULTS In an exposure study with 12 non-smoking participants, the complete urinary excretion of the metabolite 2,3-dihydroxypropylmercapturic acid (DHPMA, UHPLC-MS/MS) and of 2/3-MCPD (GC-MS) was measured on four consecutive days before and after consumption of 50 g glycidyl ester-rich palm fat or 12 g 2/3-MCPD ester-rich hazelnut oil. After controlled exposure, urinary excretion rates of 2/3-MCPD per hour strongly increased, followed by a decrease with average half-lives of 5.8 h (2-MCPD) and 3.6 h (3-MCPD). After consumption of hazelnut oil, mean excretion rates were 14.3 % (2-MCPD) and 3.7 % (3-MCPD) of the study doses. The latter rate was significantly higher (4.6 %) after consumption of palm fat, indicating partial conversion (about 5 %) of glycidol to 3-MCPD under the acidic conditions in the stomach. The average daily ""background"" exposure was estimated to be 0.12 and 0.32 μg/kg bw for 2-MCPD and 3-MCPD, respectively. The relatively high and constant urinary excretion of DHPMA did not reflect the controlled exposure. CONCLUSION Urinary excretion of 2- and 3-MCPD is suitable as biomarker for the external exposure to the respective fatty acid esters. This article is protected by copyright.

In Latvia a state of emergency was announced on March 12th, was extended twice and lifted on June 10th.ObjectivesTo estimate the prevalence of depression and distress in the general population of Latvia and association with substance use during the state of emergency.MethodsThe nationwide representative online study in the general population of Latvia was conducted in July 2020 during three week period. The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) was used to determine the presence of distress/depression. The structured questionnaire to determine psychoactive substance use was applied. Proportions of independent variables across the study groups were compared using Chi-squaretest.ResultsThe study sample included 2608 respondents. The prevalence of depression and distress was estimated at 5.7% (95%CI 4.92 – 6.71) and 13.5% (95%CI 6.85 – 8.91), respectively. Patients with depression (28% vs. 7.4%, p <0.001) and distress (30.9% vs. 7.4% p <0.05) smoked more tobacco compared to respondents without distress/depression. Those with depression or distress were significantly more likely to consume more alcohol during the emergency state than people without depression or distress (14.0% and 17.7% vs. 6.6%, p <0.001). The changes in the use of other psychoactive substances in those who had depression or distress were not statistically significant.ConclusionsPreparing support systems to mitigate mental health consequences is needed urgently.","Vrublevska, J.; Šibalova, A.; Aleskere, I.; Rezgale, B.; Smirnova, D.; Fountoulakis, K.; Rancans, E.",European Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2021.654,16
168779,Lockdown stress and burnout of public health personnel during the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak in Southern Thailand,2021,"Ambiguous user requirements are usually considered problematic in software engineering. Therefore, many studies have been conducted on its avoidance and detection. However, the detected ambiguities were resolved manually using interviews, brainstorming, and group discussion sessions among the elicitors and stakeholders for whom the software was developed. If not addressed efficiently, it gives rise to the explicit issues of additional time and cost involved and the stakeholders' availability to clarify them during multiple sessions. However, if appropriately addressed, it can reveal some implicit issues, such as tacit knowledge, hesitation, and terminological discrepancies. Identifying these implicit issues is not easy, as it requires expert elicitation skills that usually come with experience. In addition to the increasing demand for an automated approach to address these implicit issues, the recent COVID 19 pandemics has also amplified the demand to address the explicit issue of stakeholder availability. This paper proposes an implementable semi-automated approach to help elicitors address these demands. The proposed approach uses intuitionistic fuzzy logic to address hesitation and statistical functions to identify discordance and tacit knowledge. It also uses the heuristic knowledge gained in each iteration to improve itself. We implemented it in an online tool and conducted controlled experiments to evaluate our approach, and the results were compared. We achieved precision, recall, and F1 score of 0.769, 1, and 0.869, respectively, during our experiments. The results show that the proposed approach may minimize the explicit issues and help novice elicitors address the implicit issues discussed earlier.","Ahmad, Y.; Wan-Kadir, W. M.

Although primary host plants of this native species remain unknown, these are central to testing hypotheses concerning the outbreak.We hypothesized that this species has undergone a host plant shift (i.e. a feeding association with a novel host plant).We compared δ13C and δ15N ratios of adult beetles retrieved from South African museum collections, collected between 1891 and 2016 (n = 23;'pre‐outbreak'), with samples from infested fields in 2017 (n = 9, 'post‐outbreak') and in 2019 (n = 23, 'post‐outbreak'), as well as diverse, plausible host plants (n = 42 samples across 10 species) from infested fields and surrounding patches of indigenous and commercial forest vegetation. We used Bayesian isotope mixing models to infer the relative contribution of the different plants to the diet of C. newmannii.Pre‐outbreak, C3 plants contributed strongly to the larval diet, whereas post‐outbreak, C4 plants were the largest component of their diet. There was some indication of C4 plants contributing to their diet pre‐outbreak.Our results suggest that the outbreak of this polyphagous beetle was not a dramatic host shift but rather a rapid increase in the proportion of C4 plants already in their diet.We concluded that plants from the families Fabaceae and Poaceae are the most likely host plants of this species. Nevertheless, the drivers of this rapid outbreak on sugarcane remain poorly determined and should be the focus of future research.

176855,Expanding telemedicine to reduce the burden on the healthcare systems and poverty in Africa for a post-coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic reformation,2021,"Implementation of anaerobic digestion of primary sludge in modern wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) limits the availability of organic carbon for denitrification in conventional nitrification-denitrification (N/DN) systems. In order to ensure efficient denitrification, dosage of the external carbon source is commonly undertaken. However, application of commercial products, such us ethanol or acetate, greatly increases operational costs. As such, inexpensive and efficient alternative carbon sources are strongly desirable. In this study, the use of the fusel oil, a by-product from the distillery industry, was validated in terms of the denitrification process enhancement and impact on the activated sludge bacterial community structure. The experiment was conducted at a full scale biological nutrient removal facility (210,000 PE), in the set of the two technological lines: the experimental line (where fusel oil was introduced at 45 cm3/m3 dose) and the reference line (without an external carbon source addition). During the experimental period of 98 days, conventional nitrate utilization rate (NUR) measurements were carried out on a regular basis in order to assess the biomass adaptation to the fusel oil addition and denitrification process enhancement. While the NURs remained at a stable level in the reference line (1.4 ± 0.1 mg NO3-N/g VSS·h) throughout the entire duration of the experiment, the addition of fusel oil gradually enhanced the denitrification process rate up to 2.7 mg NO3-N/g VSS·h. Moreover, fusel oil contributed to the mitigation of the variability of NO3-N concentrations in the effluent from the anoxic zone. The bacterial community structure, characterized by 16S rRNA PCR—DGGE and the clone libraries of the genes involved in the denitrification process (nirS and nirK), was comparable between the reference and the experimental line during the entire experimental period. In both analyzed lines, the most frequent occurrence of denitrifiers belonging to the genera Acidovorax, Alcaligenes, Azoarcus, Paracoccus and Thauera was noticed. Our results proved that fusel oil would a valuable substrate for denitrification. The addition of fusel oil enhances the process rate and does not reflect a severe selection pressure on the bacterial community at applicable doses. Practical application of fusel oil generates opportunities for the WWTPs to meet effluent standards and reduce operational costs, as well as optimizing waste management for the distillery industry.","Kowal, Przemysław Ciesielski Sławomir Otieno Jeremiah Majtacz Joanna Barbara Czerwionka Krzysztof Mąkinia Jacek",Energies,https://doi.org/10.3390/en14175225,16
177954,"Clinical profiles, demographic features, and maternal outcomes among coronavirus disease positive pregnant women: A cross-sectional study",2021,"Abstract Ethnic Malaysian Chinese used to observe the 1-month postpartum confinement period at home and many families would engage a traditional postpartum carer (TPC) to help care for the mother and newborn. A recent trend has been the development of confinement centres (CCs) which are private non-healthcare establishments run by staff not trained in health care. Concerns about hygiene in CCs arose after infections were reported. We describe the practice of hand hygiene observed in CCs, the availability of resources for hygiene and to determine the prevalence of health related problems in CCs. Methods This is a cohort study of ethnic Chinese mothers intending to breastfeed their healthy infants. They were recruited post-delivery along with a comparison group who planned to spend their confinement period at home, then all were telephone interviewed after their 1-month confinement period about their experience. To avoid any alteration in behaviour, mothers were not told at recruitment that they had to observe hygiene practices. Multiple logistic regression was used to assess the effect of place of confinement on rates of infant health problems. Results Of 187 mothers, 88 (47%) went to 27 different CCs while 99 (53%) stayed at home. Response rates for the 1-month interviews were 88% (CC) versus 97% (home). Mothers in CC group stayed in one to four-bedded rooms and 92% of them had their baby sleeping separately in a common nursery described to have up to 17 babies at a time; 74% of them spent less than six hours a day with their babies; 43% noticed that CC staff had inadequate hand hygiene practices; 66% reported no hand-basins in their rooms; 30% reported no soap at hand-basins; 28% reported inexperienced or inadequate staff and 4% reported baby item sharing. Of mothers staying at home, 35% employed a TPC to care for her baby; 32% did not room-in with their babies, but only 11% spent less than 6 hours a day with their babies. 18% of mothers who employed TPCs reported that their TPC had unsatisfactory hand hygiene practices. Health problems that were probably related to infection (HPRI) like fever and cough were similar between the groups: 14% (CC) versus 14% (home) (p=0.86). Multiple logistic regression did not show that CCs were a factor for HPRI: aOR 1.28 (95% CI 0.36 to 4.49). Three mothers reported events that could indicate transmission of infection in CCs. Conclusion We found unsatisfactory hygiene practices in CCs as reported by mothers who spent their confinement period there. Although we were not able to establish any direct evidence of infection transmission but based on reports given by the mothers in this study, it is likely to be happening. Therefore, future studies, including intervention studies, are urgently needed to establish an appropriate hygiene standard in CCs as well as the best method to implement this standard. Empowering CC staff with hygiene knowledge so that they can be involved and contribute to the development of the development of these standards would be important.","Foong, S. C.; Foong, W.

Potential vaccines against COVID-19 have been developed swiftly and vaccination programs were started in many countries. Turkey agreed to use inactivated vaccine candidate, 'CoronaVac' produced by Chinese biopharmaceutical company (3). Many of our patients having a rheumatic diseases (RD) call us for permission to get vaccination, while some express their concerns about the efficacy and safety issues. Objectives: We therefore assessed the willingness to get vaccination among patients with RD compared to health workers and a sample from general population. Methods: A web-based questionnaire study was conducted in a cross-sectional design in 3 groups of participants: 1. patients with RD, 2. hospital workers and 3. General population. The questionnaire sought socio-demographic variables, COVID-19 related risk factors, willingness to get vaccination, and concerns and thoughts about vaccine. COVID-19 related anxiety (CAS) was also evaluated through the questionnaire. Results: We studied in total 732 (258 M/ 474 F) patients with RD, 320 (88 M/ 232 F) hospital workers and 763 (258 M/ 505 F) individuals representing general population. Patients with RD were significantly older and less educated and spent less time using social media compared to both control groups (Table 1). CAS scores were similar between the study groups. Of the patients with RD, 29.2% were willing to be vaccinated, 19% were unwilling and 51.8% were undecided. These were similar among the general population (34.6%, 23.3% and 42.1%, respectively), whereas hospital workers were significantly more willing (52.5%, 20.9% and 26.6%, respectively) (p<0.0001). About a third in each group thought that vaccination should be obligatory.The major concerns associated with vaccine were fear from side effects, unknown scientific results and lack of confidence. Being male, older age, working in a hospital and increased anxiety levels were found to be independently associated with willingness. Conclusion: Only about one third of the patients with RD were willing to get vaccination, which was somewhat similar to that observed among the general population. This could be due to rushed vaccine development as well as negative news on vaccines on the social media. Our study also reveals that, after almost one year after the pandemic, about 95% in all study groups did not express dysfunctional anxiety related with COVID-19.","Yurttas, B.; Poyraz, B.

191036,Community-acquired Pneumonia: A Global Perspective.,2016,"BACKGROUND Adjuvant chemotherapy for stage III colon cancer is internationally accepted as standard treatment with established efficacy, but the usefulness of adjuvant chemotherapy for stage II colon cancer remains controversial. The major Western guidelines recommend adjuvant chemotherapy for ""high-risk stage II"" cancer, but this is not clearly defined and the efficacy has not been confirmed. METHODS/DESIGN SACURA trial is a multicenter randomized phase III study which aims to evaluate the superiority of 1-year adjuvant treatment with UFT to observation without any adjuvant treatment after surgery for stage II colon cancer in a large population, and to identify ""high-risk factors of recurrence/death"" in stage II colon cancer and predictors of efficacy and adverse events of the chemotherapy. Patients aged between 20 and 80 years with curatively resected stage II colon cancer are randomly assigned to a observation group or UFT adjuvant therapy group (UFT at 500-600 mg/day as tegafur in 2 divided doses after meals for 5 days, followed by 2-day rest. This 1-week treatment cycle is repeated for 1 year). The patients are followed up for 5 years until recurrence or death. Treatment delivery and adverse events are entered into a web-based case report form system every 3 months. The target sample size is 2,000 patients. The primary endpoint is disease-free survival, and the secondary endpoints are overall survival, recurrence-free survival, and incidence and severity of adverse events. In an additional translational study, the mRNA expression of 5-FU-related enzymes, microsatellite instability and chromosomal instability, and histopathological factors including tumor budding are assessed to evaluate correlation with recurrences, survivals and adverse events. DISCUSSION A total of 2,024 patients were enrolled from October 2006 to July 2010. The results of this study will provide important information that help to improve the therapeutic strategy for stage II colon cancer.

192662,Bilevel noninvasive positive pressure ventilation for acute respiratory failure: survey of Ontario practice.,2005,"INTRODUCTION In concert with increased concerns regarding both biologic terrorism and new natural infectious disease threats (e.g., severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS] and West Nile virus), as a result of advances in medical informatics, various data sources are available to epidemiologists for routine, prospective monitoring of public health. The synthesis of this evidence requires tools to find anomalies within various data stream combinations while maintaining manageable false alarm rates. OBJECTIVES The objectives of this report are to establish statistical hypotheses to define the compound multivariate problem of surveillance systems, present statistical methods for testing these hypotheses, and examine results of applying these methods to simulated and actual data. METHODS Canonical problems of parallel monitoring and consensus monitoring are considered in this report. Modified Bonferroni methods are examined for parallel monitoring. Both multiple univariate and multivariate methods are applied for consensus monitoring. A multivariate adaptation of Monte Carlo trials, using the injection of epidemic-curve-like signals in the multiple data streams of interest, is presented for evaluation of the various tests. RESULTS The Monte Carlo test results demonstrate that the multiple univariate combination methods of Fisher and Edgington provide the most robust detection performance across the scenarios tested. As the number of data streams increases, methods based on Hotelling's T2 offer added sensitivity for certain signal scenarios. This potential advantage is clearer when strong correlation exists among the data streams. CONCLUSION Parallel and consensus monitoring tools must be blended to enable a surveillance system with distributed sensitivity and controlled alert rates. Whether a multiple univariate or multivariate approach should be used for consensus monitoring depends on the number and distribution of useful data sources and also on their covariance structure and stationarity. Strong, consistent correlation among numerous sources warrants the examination of multivariate control charts.","Burkom, Howard S; Murphy, S; Coberly, J; Hurt-Mullen, K",MMWR supplements,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16177694/,16

199214,"Sentiment Analysis of Tweets on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic from Metro Manila, Philippines",2020,"BACKGROUND Policies concerning restricted or open visiting hours are being challenged in health care institutions internationally, with no apparent consensus on the appropriateness of the visiting hour policies for pediatric and adult patients. The rules that govern practice are often based on the institutional precedent and assumptions of staff, and may have little or no evidence to support them. Policy and practice related to visiting hours is of pressing concern in Canada, and in Ontario specifically, following the reaction to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003 and subsequent changes in visiting policies in most health care settings. A systematic investigation of the impact of hospital visiting hours on visitors (including patients, families, and significant others) would inform decision-makers who are responsible for hospital policies about the best available evidence. OBJECTIVES The objective of this review was to appraise and synthesize the best available evidence on the impact of hospital visiting hours on patients and their visitors. INCLUSION CRITERIA Types of participants This review considered studies that included both pediatric and adult hospital patients and their visitors. Participants were either patients, visitors, or health care providers in the following hospital settings: medical/surgical units, critical care (ICU, CCU, NICU), pediatrics, maternity, or general hospital wards.Articles were excluded if participants came from the following settings: post-operative and post-anaesthesia care units (PACU), dementia wards, long-term care settings or retirement homes, or delivery rooms. PACUs were excluded because there are aspects of the presence of visitors to these units that are very specific, and differ from the general visits to patients who are not in the immediate post-operative stage. Dementia wards, long-term care settings and retirement homes were excluded because these were considered to be their ""home"", so visiting would be quite different from that on acute care hospital wards. Finally, delivery rooms were excluded because this review does not evaluate the impact of the outcomes of presence during ""delivery"" (or other ""procedures"").Types of interventions Studies were considered for inclusion in this review if they evaluated the effect or impact of visiting policies. This included interventions targeted at limiting or expanding patient visiting. We anticipated a paucity of experimental studies regarding this review question, thus included observational studies where the impact of visiting policy on patients and/or visitors was a focus, but testing intervention(s) may not have been the primary aim. We did not consider observational studies that focused only on the presence of visitors during specific procedures, resuscitation, or childbirth. The reason is that this limited aspect of the presence of a significant other was not considered ""visiting"" per se, and would be best examined in another systematic review.Types of outcome measures For this review, outcome measures related to both patients and visitors as a result of visiting hour policies were considered, including but not limited to: patient and/or visitor satisfaction; attitudes; beliefs; perceptions; mood; or patient physiological outcomes. These also included health care provider beliefs, perceptions, and attitudes about the impact of visiting policies on patients and/or visitors. Studies were excluded if they examined the trend of current visiting hour policies (with no evaluation of their impact), or if they focused on visitor presence only during emergency procedures, resuscitation, or childbirth.Types of studies Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-experimental studies were included. However, given the expected scarcity of these designs relevant to our review question, other quantitative research designs were considered, such as non-randomized controlled trials, before-and-after studies, and descriptive/observational studies. SEARCH STRATEGY Using a defined search and retrieval method the following databases from 1995-2007 were accessed: Medline, CINAHL, Embase, PsycINFO, HealthSTAR, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, AMED, and ERIC. METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY Each paper was assessed by two independent reviewers for methodological quality prior to inclusion in the review using standardized critical appraisal instruments for evidence of effectiveness, from the Joanna Briggs Institute. Disagreements were dealt with by consultations with a third reviewer. DATA COLLECTION Information was extracted from each paper independently by two reviewers using the standardized data extraction tool developed by the Joanna Briggs Institute. Disagreements were dealt with by consultations with a third reviewer. DATA SYNTHESIS Due to type of designs and quality of available studies, it was not possible to pool quantitative research study results in a statistical meta-analysis. Since statistical pooling was not possible, the findings are presented in a descriptive narrative form. RESULTS Fifteen studies met the inclusion criteria for this review. The study designs were varied, and included one pilot randomized trial, two quasi-experimental studies, eight descriptive studies/cross-sectional surveys, and four pre-post intervention questionnaires. Findings were inconsistent across studies. Nurses inconsistently enforced visiting policies. In ICU settings, liberalized visiting hours did not increase septic complications. One study reinforced the need for increased patient control over visiting (individual visit contracts, devices). Flexible (open) visitation policies increased patient and visitor satisfaction, and sibling visitation was beneficial to the patient and family. In maternity settings, a 'combination policy' was useful (open visiting for partner, more restricted visiting for others). CONCLUSION Key recommendations are provided that refer to clinical practice in critical care, maternity, and general ward settings, as well as recommendations for future research. In critical care settings, policy makers/administrators need to be aware of their staff nurses' beliefs and attitudes about visiting policies, educate them about the rationale for these policies and consider program development to assist nurses to work with families. Open visitation, and ways to increase patient control of visiting should be considered. No connection was found between liberal visiting hours and increased infection rates. When facilitating sibling visitation in the NICU, a pre-visit education process is recommended.

201808,The Status of Psychological Issues Among Frontline Health Workers Confronting the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic,2020,"Persistently infected cultures of DBT cells were established with mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 (MHV-A59), and the evolution of the MHV leader RNA and 5' end of the genome was studied through 119 days postinfection. Sequence analysis of independent clones demonstrated an overall mutation frequency approaching 1.2 x 10(-3) to 6.7 x 10(-3). The rate of fixation of mutations was about 1.2 x 10(-5) to 7.6 x 10(-5) per nucleotide (nt) per day. In contrast to finding in bovine coronavirus, the MHV leader RNA sequences were extremely stable and did not evolve significantly during persistent infection. Rather, a 5' untranslated region (UTR) A-to-G mutation at nt 77 in the genomic RNA emerged by day 56 and accumulated until 50 to 80% of the genome-length molecules retained the mutation by 119 days postinfection. Although other 5'-end mutations were noted, only the nt 77 mutation was significantly associated with viral persistence in vitro. Mutations were also found in the 5' end of the p28 coding region, but no specific alterations accumulated in genome-length molecules through 119 days postinfection. The 5' UTR nt 77 mutation resulted in an 18-amino-acid open reading frame (ORF) upstream of the ORF 1a AUG start site. By in vitro translation assays, the small ORF was not translated into detectable product but the mutation significantly enhanced translation of the downstream p28 ORF about 2.5-fold. Variant viruses, containing either the nt 77 A-to-G mutation (V16-ATG+) or wild-type sequences at this locus (V1-ATG-), were isolated at 119 days postinfection. The variant viruses replicated more efficiently than wild-type virus and were extremely cytolytic in DBT cells, suggesting that the A-to-G mutation did not encode a nonlytic or attenuated phenotype. Consistent with the in vitro translation results, a significant increase (approximately 3.5-fold) in p28 expression was also observed with the mutant virus (V16-ATG+) in DBT cells compared with that in wild-type controls. These data indicate that MHV persistence was significantly associated with mutation and evolution in the 5'-end UTR which enhanced the translation of the ORF 1a and potentially ORF 1b polyproteins which function in virus transcription and replication.","Chen, W; Baric, R S",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7494259/,16

206746,Commentary: Trauma alert! Evidence to support the safe use of contused lungs,2020,"Background: Electrolyte abnormalities are not uncommon in Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The data of several studies suggest that various electrolyte imbalances seem to be having impact on disease prognosis. However, no study in literature primarily focused on baseline electrolyte abnormalities' effect on disease outcome. In this study, we assessed the validity of the hypothesis: ""The baseline electrolyte imbalances may be related to unfavourable outcomes in the hospitalized COVID-19 patients"". Material-Methods: Design of the study was retrospective and observational. We included 408 hospitalized COVID-19 patients over 18 years old. Baseline levels of sodium, potassium, calcium and chloride were assessed. We evaluated the effect of those electrolytes' abnormalities on intensive care unit and mechanical ventilation requirement, hospitalization duration and treatment outcome. Also, we clustered the patients based upon electrolyte levels. Thereafter, we compared the clusters according to outcome variables and then, we compared the frequency of other severe disease indices between the clusters. Lastly, we evaluated the independent factors related to COVID -19 associated deaths with multivariate analyse. Results: 228 (55.8%) of the patients had at least one electrolyte imbalances at baseline. Hyponatremia was the most frequent electrolyte abnormality. Patients with hyponatremia, hypochloride or hypocalcemia respectively would have more frequent requirement of intensive care unit and mechanical ventilation; higher mortality rate and longer hospitalization. Moreover, the cluster associated with electrolyte abnormalities had unfavourable outcome. Also, clinical and laboratory features associated with severe disease were detected more often in those cluster. Furthermore, hyponatremia was found as one of the independent factors related to death from COVID-19 (OR 10.33; CI %95 1.62-65.62; p=0.01). Conclusion: Baseline electrolyte imbalances, primarily hyponatremia would be related to poor prognosis in COVID-19 and baseline electrolyte assessment would be beneficial for evaluating the risk of severe COVID-19.","Tezcan, Mehmet Engin; Dogan Gokce, Gizem; Sen, Nesrin; Zorlutuna Kaymak, Nilufer; Ozer, Rasit Serdar",New Microbes New Infect,,16
209697,Attitudes and Perceptions Towards Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Vaccine Acceptance Among Recovered African American Patients,2021,"COVID-19 has changed the landscape of healthcare in the UK since the first confirmed case in January 2020. Most of the resources have been directed towards reducing transmission in the hospital and clinical environment, but little is known about what community nurses can do to reduce the risk when they nurse people in their own homes? This article looks at what COVID-19 is, how it is spread and how health professionals are at an increased risk from aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs). There is also a discussion on the benefit of mask usage. It defines what AGPs are, which clinical procedures are AGPs, including ones performed in the community setting, and which identified clinical practices that have been mistaken for AGPs. There is also a discussion on the suitability of performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). It also describes how to reduce the risk by the use of full personal protective equipment (PPE) and other strategies when AGPs are performed in a patient's home. It ends with general advice about managing the risk of COVID-19 transmission with patients in their homes.","Payne, Drew; Peache, Martin",Br J Community Nurs,,16
211160,Augmentation of pulmonary arterial growth in single ventricle patients by interim selective shunts,2020,"BACKGROUND: Enteral immunomodulatory nutrition is recommended as an adjuvant therapy for patients in intensive care units (ICU), but its effectiveness is incompletely understood. AIM: The aim of this review was to examine the effect of a commonly used immunomodulatory formula-omega-3 fatty acids, Î³-linolenic acid, and antioxidants-on clinical outcomes and mortality risk in critically ill patients. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). METHOD: PubMed, Scopus, and Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) Web of Knowledge databases were searched until 18 February 2021. RCTs that used the immunomodulatory formula in the ICU were included. RESULTS: Ten RCTs (1166 participants) were included in the meta-analysis. The immunomodulatory formula reduced the duration of ICU stay weighted mean difference [(WMD): -2.97 days; 95%CI: -5.59, -0.35)], mechanical ventilation (WMD = -2.20 days, 95%CI: -4.29, -0.10), sequential organ failure assessment and multiple organ dysfunction scores (Hedge's g: -0.42 U/L; 95% CI: -0.74, -0.11), decreased 8-day overall mortality risk (RR = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.58, 0.91), and extended the ICU-free days (WMD: 4.06 days, 95% CI: 0.02, 8.09). The improvement in respiratory function and reduction in mortality risk was more in patients with acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Furthermore, the reduction in mechanical ventilation and mortality risk was more evident in older (>60 years) vs young adults. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Taken together, the immunomodulatory formula may enhance clinical practice for critical care nurses, such that the prevalence and/or susceptibility to secondary conditions commonly encountered in the ICU (ie, ALI and ARDS) could be attenuated, ultimately allowing critical care nurses to focus their care on the primary reason for which a patient is in the ICU.

OBJECTIVES: To verify the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the blood donor's attendance and production of blood components in Fundação Hemominas, a Brazilian public institution was formed by several Blood Centres. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out from January to June 2020. Data collected were compared to a historical series from 2016 to 2019. RESULTS: The study showed a reduction in the attendance of blood donors, whole blood collections and blood component production from March 2020, when the first case of COVID-19 was notified in Minas Gerais, Brazil. The results evidenced that Hemominas Blood Centres were affected in a very distinct way by the pandemic with a general mean reduction around 17% in attendance of blood donors and in production of blood components in the period of March to June. On the other hand, the return of blood donors rate increased. CONCLUSION: The reduction in blood donation during the pandemic period was significant, despite the measures adopted. Still, the recruitment of return donors appears to be an important measure to be considered to decrease the pandemic's effect on blood stocks.","Silva-Malta, Maria Clara Fernandes; Rodrigues, Daniela de Oliveira Werneck; Chaves, Daniel Gonçalves; Magalhães, Nathalia Noyma Sampaio; Ribeiro, Maísa Aparecida; Cioffi, Junia Guimarães Mourão; Martins, Marina Lobato",,,16

METHODS: We utilized a hospital based prospective data registry. The primary end point was to assess the impact of hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin, on outcome, length of hospitalization, and time to clinical improvement. We utilized treatment effects with inverse-probability-weighting and Cox proportional hazards models. All analyses accounted for age, gender, race, severity on admission, days from symptoms onset and chronic comorbidities. RESULTS: 36 patients received hydroxychloroquine and were age- and sex-matched to 72 patients with COVID-19 who received supportive care. Compared to supportive care, the use of HCQ did not shorten the time to clinical improvement (+0.23 days; 95% CI: -1.8-2.3 days) nor did it shorten the duration of hospital stay (+0.91 days; 95% CI: -1.1-2.9 days). Additionally, HCQ did not decrease the risk of COVID-19 in-hospital death (aHR 1.67; 95% CI: 0.29-9.36). Finally, we observed a slight QTc prolongation from a baseline of 444 ± 26 ms to 464 ± 32 ms (mean±SD) among patients receiving hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin. CONCLUSION: This study did not yield benefits from hydroxychloroquine use in patients with COVID-19 and monitoring for adverse events is warranted. Nevertheless, the treatment was safely studied under the guidance of an antimicrobial stewardship program.","Kalligeros, Markos; Shehadeh, Fadi; Atalla, Eleftheria; Mylona, Evangelia K; Aung, Su; Pandita, Aakriti; Larkin, Jerry; Sanchez, Martha; Touzard-Romo, Francine; Brotherton, Amy; Shah, Rajeev; Cunha, Cheston B; Mylonakis, Eleftherios",J Glob Antimicrob Resist,,16
215798,Pedal Gangrene in a Patient with COVID-19 Treated with Prone Positioning and Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation,2021,"BACKGROUND: Mononuclear phagocytes (MPs), including macrophages, monocytes, and dendritic cells (DCs), are phagocytic cells with important roles in immunity. The developmental origin of kidney DCs has been highly debated because of the large phenotypic overlap between macrophages and DCs in this tissue. METHODS: We used fate mapping, RNA sequencing, flow cytometry, confocal microscopy, and histo-cytometry to assess the origin and phenotypic and functional properties of renal DCs in healthy kidney and of DCs after cisplatin and ischemia reperfusion-induced kidney injury. RESULTS: Adult kidney contains at least four subsets of MPs with prominent Clec9a-expression history indicating a DC origin. We demonstrate that these populations are phenotypically, functionally, and transcriptionally distinct from each other. We also show these kidney MPs exhibit unique age-dependent developmental heterogeneity. Kidneys from newborn mice contain a prominent population of embryonic-derived MHCIInegF4/80hiCD11blow macrophages that express T cell Ig and mucin domain containing 4 (TIM-4) and MER receptor tyrosine kinase (MERTK). These macrophages are replaced within a few weeks after birth by phenotypically similar cells that express MHCII but lack TIM-4 and MERTK. MHCII+F4/80hi cells exhibit prominent Clec9a-expression history in adulthood but not early life, indicating additional age-dependent developmental heterogeneity. In AKI, MHCIInegF4/80hi cells reappear in adult kidneys as a result of MHCII downregulation by resident MHCII+F4/80hi cells, possibly in response to prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). RNA sequencing further suggests MHCII+F4/80hi cells help coordinate the recruitment of inflammatory cells during renal injury. CONCLUSIONS: Distinct developmental programs contribute to renal DC and macrophage populations throughout life, which could have important implications for therapies targeting these cells.","Salei, Natallia; Rambichler, Stephan; Salvermoser, Johanna; Papaioannou, Nikos E; Schuchert, Ronja; Pakalniskyte, Dalia; Li, Na; Marschner, Julian A; Lichtnekert, Julia; Stremmel, Christopher; Cernilogar, Filippo M; Salvermoser, Melanie; Walzog, Barbara; Straub, Tobias; Schotta, Gunnar; Anders, Hans-Joachim; Schulz, Christian; Schraml, Barbara U",J Am Soc Nephrol,,16

(4) From a public health view, it seems encouraging that despite the somatic risk condition, generalized anxiety and depression are not higher in patients with diabetes than in controls. Patients with diabetes report higher COVID-19-related fear, increased risk perception, and behavioral changes. This suggests that individuals with diabetes, as a significant risk group of severe COVID-19, show an adequate perception and functional reaction to the current pandemic.","Musche, V.; Kohler, H.; Bauerle, A.; Schweda, A.; Weismuller, B.; Fink, M.; Schadendorf, T.; Robitzsch, A.; Dorrie, N.; Tan, S.; Teufel, M.; Skoda, E.

221310,Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation for Severe Respiratory Failure During Respiratory Epidemics and Pandemics: A Narrative Review,2020,"PURPOSE: To present the different clinical manifestations of rhino-orbital mucormycosis (ROM) co-infection in severe COVID-19 patients. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective observational clinical study METHODS: Among 32,814 patients hospitalized with the diagnosis of COVID-19 between March 2020 and December 2020 in our center, eleven microbiologically confirmed ROM co-infection cases in severe COVID-19 patients were evaluated. RESULTS: There were nine men and two women with a mean age of 73.1 ± 7.7 years. Eight patients had uncontrolled type 2 diabetes with a mean diagnosis duration of 12.1 ± 4.4 years. All patients had COVID-19-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome and received corticosteroids. The mean time interval between COVID-19 diagnosis and ROM diagnosis was 14.4 ± 4.3 days. Seven patients (63.6%) had orbital apex syndrome, and four patients (36.4%) presented with orbital cellulitis. Endophthalmitis was detected in 54.5% of patients, and two of these patients developed retinoschisis. CT scan/MRI revealed sino-orbital involvement in all patients, and three of these had cerebral involvement at initial presentation. All patients received intravenous and retrobulbar liposomal amphotericin B and had undergone radical debridement of involved sinuses. Intravitreal liposomal amphotericin B injected in patients with endophthalmitis. Despite all measures, 63.6% of patients expired. CONCLUSIONS: Severe COVID-19 is associated with a significant incidence of ROM with higher mortality rates due to immune dysregulation and the widespread use of steroids. Physicians should be aware of the possibility of this infection in patients with COVID-19. An aggressive multidisciplinary approach can help to reduce mortality.","Bayram, Nurettin; Ozsaygili, Cemal; Sav, Hafize; Tekin, Yucel; Gundogan, Medine; Pangal, Emine; Cicek, Ayse; Özcan, Ibrahim",Jpn. j. ophthalmol,,16

228178,The rapid transformation of cardiac surgery practice in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic: Insights and clinical strategies from a center at the epicenter,2020,"AIMS: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has rapidly evolved into a sweeping pandemic. Its major manifestation is in the respiratory tract, and the general extent of organ involvement and the microscopic changes in the lungs remain insufficiently characterised. Autopsies are essential to elucidate COVID-19-associated organ alterations. METHODS AND RESULTS: This article reports the autopsy findings of 21 COVID-19 patients hospitalised at the University Hospital Basel and at the Cantonal Hospital Baselland, Switzerland. An in-corpore technique was performed to ensure optimal staff safety. The primary cause of death was respiratory failure with exudative diffuse alveolar damage and massive capillary congestion, often accompanied by microthrombi despite anticoagulation. Ten cases showed superimposed bronchopneumonia. Further findings included pulmonary embolism (n = 4), alveolar haemorrhage (n = 3), and vasculitis (n = 1). Pathologies in other organ systems were predominantly attributable to shock; three patients showed signs of generalised and five of pulmonary thrombotic microangiopathy. Six patients were diagnosed with senile cardiac amyloidosis upon autopsy. Most patients suffered from one or more comorbidities (hypertension, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes mellitus). Additionally, there was an overall predominance of males and individuals with blood group A (81% and 65%, respectively). All relevant histological slides are linked as open-source scans in supplementary files. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides an overview of postmortem findings in COVID-19 cases, implying that hypertensive, elderly, obese, male individuals with severe cardiovascular comorbidities as well as those with blood group A may have a lower threshold of tolerance for COVID-19. This provides a pathophysiological explanation for higher mortality rates among these patients.","Menter, Thomas; Haslbauer, Jasmin D; Nienhold, Ronny; Savic, Spasenija; Hopfer, Helmut; Deigendesch, Nikolaus; Frank, Stephan; Turek, Daniel; Willi, Niels; Pargger, Hans; Bassetti, Stefano; Leuppi, Joerg D; Cathomas, Gieri; Tolnay, Markus; Mertz, Kirsten D; Tzankov, Alexandar",Histopathology,,16

However, there are conflicting reports of estimated deaths in the post-cardiac transplantation patient population associated with COVID-19. METHODS: Observational, retrospective analysis of a large cohort of post Orthotopic Heart Transplantation (OHT) patients in a high volume heart transplantation program in Dallas, Texas underwent outpatient COVID-19 screening and testing for both SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal RT-PCR and anti-SARS-CoV2 IgG serology as a result of a clinic protocol to facilitate re-opening of face-to-face outpatient clinical visits. RESULTS: The full outpatient cohort tested at time of their clinic visit tested negative for COVID-19 by nasopharyngeal RT-PCR. Only 2 patients tested seropositive for anti-SARS-COV2 IgG. Five positive inpatient cases were also identified and all, but one recovered. CONCLUSION: A COVID-19 surveillance protocol can be easily instituted in this high-risk population and facilitate safe transplant clinic operation. As the cases and prevalence increase across the United States, further strategies will need to be developed to determine the best course of action to help manage this select population while minimizing their exposure to the ongoing pandemic.","Carey, Sandra A; Afzal, Aasim; Jamil, Aayla; Williams, Sarah; Gottlieb, Robert L",Clin Transplant,,16

While application tasks serve as suitable benchmarks for real world problems, RL is seldomly used in practical scenarios consisting of abrupt dynamics. This allows one to rethink the problem setup in light of practical challenges. We present Trade Execution using Reinforcement Learning (TradeR) which aims to address two such practical challenges of catastrophy and surprise minimization by formulating trading as a real-world hierarchical RL problem. Through this lens, TradeR makes use of hierarchical RL to execute trade bids on high frequency real market experiences comprising of abrupt price variations during the 2019 fiscal year COVID19 stock market crash. The framework utilizes an energy-based scheme in conjunction with surprise value function for estimating and minimizing surprise. In a large-scale study of 35 stock symbols from the S&P500 index, TradeR demonstrates robustness to abrupt price changes and catastrophic losses while maintaining profitable outcomes.

This study was conducted to get insights into the enhanced frequency of COVID-19 infection in this disease. METHODS: Using different bioinformatics tools, the expression and methylation patterns of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were analyzed in healthy and malignant tissues, focusing on lung adenocarcinoma and data were correlated to clinical parameters and smoking history. RESULTS: ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were heterogeneously expressed across 36 healthy tissues with the highest expression levels in digestive, urinary and reproductive organs, while the overall analysis of 72 paired tissues demonstrated significantly lower expression levels of ACE2 in cancer tissues when compared to normal counterparts. In contrast, ACE2, but not TMPRSS2, was overexpressed in LUAD, which inversely correlated to the promoter methylation. This upregulation of ACE2 was age-dependent in LUAD, but not in normal lung tissues. TMPRSS2 expression in non-neoplastic lung tissues was heterogeneous and dependent on sex and smoking history, while it was downregulated in LUAD of smokers. Cancer progression was associated with a decreased TMPRSS2, but unaltered ACE2. In contrast, ACE2 and TMPRSS2 of lung metastases derived from different cancer subtypes was higher than organ metastases of other sites. TMPRSS2, but not ACE2, was associated with LUAD patients' survival. CONCLUSIONS: Comprehensive molecular analyses revealed a heterogeneous and distinct expression and/or methylation profile of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in healthy lung vs. LUAD tissues across sex, age and smoking history and might have implications for COVID-19 disease.","Subbarayan, Karthikeyan; Ulagappan, Kamatchi; Wickenhauser, Claudia; Seliger, Barbara",Current cancer drug targets (Online),,16

We carried out proteomic profiling of plasma from cross-sectional and longitudinal cohorts of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and analyzed clinical data from our health system database of more than 3300 patients. Using a machine learning algorithm, we identified a prominent signature of neutrophil activation, including resistin, lipocalin-2, hepatocyte growth factor, interleukin-8, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, which were the strongest predictors of critical illness. Evidence of neutrophil activation was present on the first day of hospitalization in patients who would only later require transfer to the intensive care unit, thus preceding the onset of critical illness and predicting increased mortality. In the health system database, early elevations in developing and mature neutrophil counts also predicted higher mortality rates. Altogether, these data suggest a central role for neutrophil activation in the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 and identify molecular markers that distinguish patients at risk of future clinical decompensation.","Meizlish, Matthew L; Pine, Alexander B; Bishai, Jason D; Goshua, George; Nadelmann, Emily R; Simonov, Michael; Chang, C-Hong; Zhang, Hanming; Shallow, Marcus; Bahel, Parveen; Owusu, Kent; Yamamoto, Yu; Arora, Tanima; Atri, Deepak S; Patel, Amisha; Gbyli, Rana; Kwan, Jennifer; Won, Christine H; Dela Cruz, Charles; Price, Christina; Koff, Jonathan; King, Brett A; Rinder, Henry M; Wilson, F Perry; Hwa, John; Halene, Stephanie; Damsky, William; van Dijk, David; Lee, Alfred I; Chun, Hyung J",Blood Adv,,16

252546,Changes in Older People's Activities During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic in Japan,2020,"COVID-19 vaccines are being rapidly developed and human trials are underway. Almost all of these vaccines have been designed to induce antibodies targeting spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 in expectation of neutralizing activities. However, non-neutralizing antibodies are at risk of causing antibody-dependent enhancement. Further, the longevity of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies is very short. Therefore, in addition to antibody-induced vaccines, novel vaccines on the basis of SARS-CoV-2-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) should be considered in the vaccine development. Here, we attempted to identify HLA-A*02:01-restricted CTL epitopes derived from the non-structural polyprotein 1a of SARS-CoV-2. Eighty-two peptides were firstly predicted as epitope candidates on bioinformatics. Fifty-four in 82 peptides showed high or medium binding affinities to HLA-A*02:01. HLA-A*02:01 transgenic mice were then immunized with each of the 54 peptides encapsulated into liposomes. The intracellular cytokine staining assay revealed that 18 out of 54 peptides were CTL epitopes because of the induction of IFN-Î³-producing CD8+ T cells. In the 18 peptides, 10 peptides were chosen for the following analyses because of their high responses. To identify dominant CTL epitopes, mice were immunized with liposomes containing the mixture of the 10 peptides. Some peptides were shown to be statistically predominant over the other peptides. Surprisingly, all mice immunized with the liposomal 10 peptide mixture did not show the same reaction pattern to the 10 peptides. There were three response patterns, suggesting the existence of an immunodominance hierarchy following peptide vaccination, which may provide us more variations in the epitope selection for designing CTL-based COVID-19 vaccines.IMPORTANCE For the development of vaccines based on SARS-CoV-2-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), we attempted to identify HLA-A*02:01-restricted CTL epitopes derived from the non-structural polyprotein 1a of SARS-CoV-2.

Medical providers, teams, and organizations have needed to shift their visits away from face-to-face visits and toward telehealth (both by phone and through video). Palliative care teams who practice in the community setting are faced with a difficult task: How do we actively triage the most urgent visits while keeping our vulnerable patients safe from the pandemic? MEASURES: The following are recommendations created by the Palo Alto Medical Foundation Palliative Care and Support Services team to help triage and coordinate for timely, safe, and effective palliative care in the community and outpatient setting during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Patients are initially triaged based on location followed by acuity. Interdisciplinary care is implemented using strict infection control guidelines in the setting of limited personal protective equipment resources. We implement thorough screening for COVID-19 symptoms at multiple levels before a patient is seen by a designated provider. CONCLUSIONS/LESSONS LEARNED: We recommend active triaging, communication, and frequent screening for COVID-19 symptoms for palliative care patients been evaluated in the community setting. An understanding of infection risk, mutual consent between designated providers, patients, and their families are crucial to maintaining safety while delivering community-based palliative care during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Tran, David L; Lai, Steve R; Salah, Ramy Y; Wong, Angela Y; Bryon, Jill N; McKenna, Meghan C; Chan, Yvonne K",J Pain Symptom Manage,,16

259062,Association of Social and Economic Inequality With Coronavirus Disease 2019 Incidence and Mortality Across US Counties,2021,"BACKGROUND: Self-care interventions offer a solution to support the achievement of three goals of the World Health Organization (WHO): to improve universal health coverage, reach people in humanitarian situations, and improve health and well-being. In light of implementing WHO consolidated guidelines on self-care interventions to strengthen sexual and reproductive health (SRH) in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR), especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, pharmacists from four different EMR countries discussed the current SRH situation, inequality gaps, barriers to SRH service access and the pharmacist's crucial role as a first-line responder to patients before, during and after COVID-19. CASE PRESENTATION: Self-care interventions for SRH allow health care providers to serve a greater number of patients, improve progress toward universal health coverage, and reach people in humanitarian crises. In fact, these interventions can be significantly enhanced by utilizing community pharmacists as first-line health care providers. This review highlights the important role of community pharmacists in promoting self-care interventions and empowering individuals, families and communities. As a result, well-informed individuals will be authoritative in their health decisions. Exploring self-care interventions in the EMR was done through reviewing selected SRH services delivery through community pharmacists before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon and Somalia. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, community pharmacists were found to be excluded from both governmental and nongovernmental SRH programmes. During the pandemic, community pharmacists managed to support patients with self-care interventions, whether voluntarily or through their pharmacy associations. This highlights the need for the health care decision-makers to involve and support community pharmacists in influencing policies and promoting self-care interventions. CONCLUSION: Self-care interventions can increase individuals' choice and autonomy over SRH. Supporting community pharmacists will definitely strengthen SRH in the EMR and may help make the health system more efficient and more targeted.","El Bizri, Luna; Jarrar, Laila Ghazi; Ali, Wael K Ali; Omar, Abdifatah H",Health Res Policy Syst,,16

260265,Phenotypes of severe COVID-19 ARDS receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation,2021,"BACKGROUND: Persistent fatigue, breathlessness, and reduced exercise tolerance have been reported following acute COVID-19 infection. Although immuno-thrombosis has been implicated in acute COVID-19 pathogenesis, the biological mechanisms underpinning long COVID remain unknown. We hypothesized that pulmonary microvascular immuno-thrombosis may be important in this context. METHODS: One hundred fifty COVID-19 patients were reviewed at St James's Hospital Dublin between May and September 2020 at a median of 80.5 (range 44-155) days after initial diagnosis. These included patients hospitalized during initial illness (n = 69) and others managed entirely as out-patients (n = 81). Clinical examination, chest x-ray, and 6-min walk tests were performed. In addition, a range of coagulation and inflammatory markers were assessed. RESULTS: Increased D-dimer levels (>500 ng/ml) were observed in 25.3% patients up to 4 months post-SARS-CoV-2 infection. On univariate analysis, elevated convalescent D-dimers were more common in COVID-19 patients who had required hospital admission and in patients aged more than 50 years (p < .001). Interestingly, we observed that 29% (n = 11) of patients with elevated convalescent D-dimers had been managed exclusively as out-patients during their illness. In contrast, other coagulation (prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen, platelet count) and inflammation (C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, and sCD25) markers had returned to normal in >90% of convalescent patients. CONCLUSIONS: Elucidating the biological mechanisms responsible for sustained D-dimer increases may be of relevance in long COVID pathogenesis and has implications for clinical management of these patients.","Townsend, Liam; Fogarty, Helen; Dyer, Adam; Martin-Loeches, Ignacio; Bannan, Ciaran; Nadarajan, Parthiban; Bergin, Colm; O039,; Farrelly, Cliona; Conlon, Niall; Bourke, Nollaig M; Ward, Soracha E; Byrne, Mary; Ryan, Kevin; Connell, Niamh; Sullivan, Jamie M; Ni Cheallaigh, Cliona; Donnell, James S",J Thromb Haemost,,16

We aimed to evaluate the socio-clinical characteristics and outcome of various options of treatment of individuals with parosmia due to COVID-19 infection. The study was conducted at two main Hospitals in the Ramadi and Tikrit cities, Iraq, on patients with a chief complaint of parosmia due to COVID-19 disease. The study involved 7 months (August 2020-February 2021). Detailed demographic and clinical characteristics and treatment options with their outcome were recorded and analyzed. Out of 268 patients with parosmia, there were 197 (73.5%) females. The majority were from age group &#8804; 30 years (n = 188, 70.1%), housewives (n = 150, 56%), non-smokers (n = 222, 82.8%), and associated with dysgeusia (n = 207, 77.2%) but not associated with nasal symptoms (n = 266, 99.3%). All patients have complained of anosmia (89.9%) or hyposmia (10.1%). Troposmia was reported in the majority of participants. The majority of the patients were suffering from severe parosmia (65.7%). Around 3 quarters of the cases were presented in &#8804; 4 months. Altered quality of life (AQL) was presented in 91.8% of subjects, and there was a significant association with the presence of dysgeusia and type and severity of parosmia. The smoking habit didn't show a significant association with AQL, the severity of parosmia, and the recovery rate. Most of the odor group was the most triggering stimuli eliciting parosmia, while, the sewage was the response odor in above 50% of the cases. The recovery rate was poor with olfactory training plus either tonics or local and systemic steroids. Parosmia due to COVID-19 infection is a common problem with poor results in the short-term treatment and follow-up. The AQL was seen in a greater proportion of patients and strongly associated with the presence of dysgeusia, type, and severity of parosmia.","Rashid, Rasheed Ali; Alaqeedy, Ameer A; Al-Ani, Raid M",Indian J Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,,16

Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) is a less common type of stroke which might be triggered by COVID-19. We present a series of CVST cases with SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: In a multinational retrospective study, we collected all cases of CVST in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients admitted to nine tertiary stroke centers from the beginning of the pandemic to June 30th, 2020. We compared the demographics, clinical and radiological characteristics, risk factors, and outcome of these patients with a control group of non-SARS-CoV-2 infected CVST patients in the same seasonal period of the years 2012-2016 from the country where the majority of cases were recruited. RESULTS: A total of 13 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria (62% women, mean age 50.9 ± 11.2 years). Six patients were discharged with good outcomes (mRS &#8804; 2) and three patients died in hospital.

Virus-laden aerosols produced by infected patients can propagate throughout ventilated rooms and put medical personnel entering them at risk. Experimental results found with a schlieren optical method have shown that the air flows generated by a cough and normal breathing were modified by the oxygenation technique used, especially when using High Flow Nasal Canulae, increasing the shedding of potentially infectious airborne particles. This study also uses a 3D Computational Fluid Dynamics model based on a Lattice Boltzmann Method to simulate the air flows as well as the movement of numerous airborne particles produced by a patient's cough within an ICU room under negative pressure. The effects of different mitigation scenarii on the amount of aerosols potentially containing SARS-CoV-2 that are extracted through the ventilation system are investigated. Numerical results indicate that adequate bed orientation and additional air treatment unit positioning can increase by 40% the number of particles extracted and decrease by 25% the amount of particles deposited on surfaces 45s after shedding. This approach could help lay the grounds for a more comprehensive way to tackle contamination risks in hospitals, as the model can be seen as a proof of concept and be adapted to any room configuration.","Crawford, Cyril; Vanoli, Emmanuel; Decorde, Baptiste; Lancelot, Maxime; Duprat, Camille; Josserand, Christophe; Jilesen, Jonathan; Bouadma, Lila; Timsit, Jean-François",Sci Rep,,16

Here, we performed a scoping review and meta-analysis including clinical studies on patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection with data on AKI assessment and characteristics, and the overall prevalence of AKI was estimated using a random-effects model. We identified 21 articles which passed the search criteria. All were quantitative observational studies which used a cross-sectional, retrospective, case report, or cohort methodology. This showed that aging, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, previous chronic disease, and other comorbidities were risk factors of AKI. Although the prevalence of proteinuria, hematuria, and increased serum creatinine was reported for up to 60% of the patients with COVID-19, the overall prevalence of AKI was estimated to be 8%. We conclude that although approximately two-thirds of patients with COVID-19 had symptoms of kidney damage, most of these did not meet the diagnostic criteria for AKI.

Therefore, it is necessary to understand the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in children and the differences from adults. CASE PRESENTATION: We report one pediatric case of COVID-19. A 14-month-old boy was admitted to the hospital with a symptom of fever, and was diagnosed with a mild form of COVID-19. The child's mother and grandmother also tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. However, the lymphocyte counts were normal. The chest computed tomography (CT) revealed scattered ground glass opacities in the right lower lobe close to the pleura and resorption after the treatment. The patient continued to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the nasopharyngeal swabs and stool at 17 days after the disappearance of symptoms. CONCLUSION: The present pediatric case of COVID-19 was acquired through household transmission, and the symptoms were mild. Lymphocyte counts did not significantly decrease. The RNA of SARS-CoV-2 in stool and nasopharyngeal swabs remained positive for an extended period of time after the disappearance of symptoms. This suggests that attention should be given to the potential contagiousness of pediatric COVID-19 cases after clinical recovery.","Mao, Li-Juan; Xu, Jian; Xu, Zhi-Hao; Xia, Xiao-Ping; Li, Bin; He, Jian-Guo; Zhao, Peng; Pan, Jian-Wei; Zhang, Dan; Su, Yue; Wang, Yue-Hong; Yuan, Zhe-Feng",BMC Infect Dis,,16

282240,Status Epilepticus in a Young Woman with Suspected Sars-cov-2 Encephalitis,2021,"BACKGROUND: The interplay between COVID-19 pandemic and asthma in children is still unclear. We evaluated the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on childhood asthma outcomes. METHODS: The PeARL multinational cohort included 1,054 children with asthma and 505 non-asthmatic children aged between 4 and 18 years from 25 pediatric departments, from 15 countries globally. We compared the frequency of acute respiratory and febrile presentations during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic between groups and with data available from the previous year. In children with asthma, we also compared current and historical disease control. RESULTS: During the pandemic, children with asthma experienced fewer upper respiratory tract infections, episodes of pyrexia, emergency visits, hospital admissions, asthma attacks, and hospitalizations due to asthma, in comparison with the preceding year. Sixty-six percent of asthmatic children had improved asthma control while in 33% the improvement exceeded the minimal clinically important difference. Pre-bronchodilatation FEV1 and peak expiratory flow rate were improved during the pandemic. When compared to non-asthmatic controls, children with asthma were not at increased risk of LRTIs, episodes of pyrexia, emergency visits, or hospitalizations during the pandemic. However, an increased risk of URTIs emerged. CONCLUSION: Childhood asthma outcomes, including control, were improved during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, probably because of reduced exposure to asthma triggers and increased treatment adherence. The decreased frequency of acute episodes does not support the notion that childhood asthma may be a risk factor for COVID-19. Furthermore, the potential for improving childhood asthma outcomes through environmental control becomes apparent.","Papadopoulos, Nikolaos G; Mathioudakis, Alexander G; Custovic, Adnan; Deschildre, Antoine; Phipatanakul, Wanda; Wong, Gary; Xepapadaki, Paraskevi; Abou-Taam, Rola; Agache, Ioana; Castro-Rodriguez, Jose A; Chen, Zhimin; Cros, Pierrick; Dubus, Jean-Christophe; El-Sayed, Zeinab Awad; El-Owaidy, Rasha; Feleszko, Wojciech; Fierro, Vincenzo; Fiocchi, Alessandro; Garcia-Marcos, Luis; Goh, Anne; Hossny, Elham M; Huerta Villalobos, Yunuen R; Jartti, Tuomas; Le Roux, Pascal; Levina, Julia; López García, Aida Inés; Ramos, Ángel Mazón; Morais-Almeida, Mário; Murray, Clare; Nagaraju, Karthik; Nagaraju, Major K; Navarrete Rodriguez, Elsy Maureen; Namazova-Baranova, Leyla; Nieto Garcia, Antonio; Pozo Beltrán, Cesar Fireth; Ratchataswan, Thanaporn; Rivero Yeverino, Daniela; Rodríguez Zagal, Eréndira; Schweitzer, Cyril E; Tulkki, Marleena; Wasilczuk, Katarzyna; Xu, Dan",Allergy,,16

The pneumococcal vaccination rate among the elderly in China was only 3.7% in 2019, it grew rapidly during the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to investigate the psychological and demographic-economic factors related to the uptake behavior of pneumococcal vaccination among the Chinese elderly by using an integrated model based on the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT), and knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP). The theoretical model was tested via structural equation modeling (SEM) with data collected from 516 Chinese older adults aged 60 years and older. Our results suggested that knowledge, performance expectancy, effort expectancy, attitude, and trust had a significant correlation with behavioral intention; behavioral intention and trust had a positive correlation with the uptake behavior, gender, and and education level and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exerted significant moderating effects. To increase the coverage of pneumococcal vaccination among the elderly, it is necessary to provide effective health education by authoritative experts, thereby enhancing their knowledge and positive attitude towardthe vaccination.","Zhou, Min; Zhan, Jiaying; Kong, Nan; Campy, Kathryn S; Chen, Yan",Psychol Health Med,,16

In the COVID-19 era, procedures involving airway management are a particular risk for health care workers due to the high virulence of the virus, the transmission through aerosol, and the risk of contagion from asymptomatic patients. In this article, we propose a simple memorandum of clinical recommendations to minimize the risk of operator infection deriving from epistaxis management. The correct use of personal protective equipment and strict compliance with the behavioral guidelines are essential to reduce the potential risk of infection. In particular, the use of filtering masks is strongly recommended since all patients, including those referring for epistaxis, should be treated as being COVID-19 positive in the emergency department. The safety of health care workers is essential not only to safeguard continuous patient care but also to limit virus transmission.","D039,; Aguanno, Vittorio; Ralli, Massimo; Greco, Antonio; de Vincentiis, Marco",Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,,16

Given the accessibility of running as exercise, gaining information on running behaviors, motivations, and running-related injury (RRI) risk during the pandemic is warranted. The purpose of this study was to assess the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on running volume, behaviors, motives, and RRI changes from the year prior to the pandemic to the timeframe during social isolation restrictions. Runners of all abilities were recruited via social media to complete a custom Qualtrics survey. Demographics, running volume, behaviors, motivations, and injury status were assessed for the year prior to the pandemic, and during social isolation measures. Descriptive statistics and Student's t-tests were used to assess changes in running outcomes during the pandemic. Logistic regressions were used to assess the influence of demographics on running behaviors and injury. Adjusted RRI risk ratios were calculated to determine the odds of sustaining an injury during the pandemic. Alpha was set to.05 for all analyses. A total of 1147 runners (66% females, median age: 35 years) across 15 countries (96% United States) completed the survey. Runners reported increased runs per week (Mean Difference with Standard Error [MD]: 0.30 [0.05], p < .001), sustained runs (MD: 0.44 [0.05], p < .001), mileage (MD: 0.87 [0.33], p = .01), and running times of day (MD: 0.11 [0.03], p < .001) during the pandemic, yet reported less workouts (i.e. sprint intervals; MD: -0.33 [0.06], p < .001), and less motives (MD [SE]: -0.41 [0.04], p < .001). Behavior changes were influenced by running experience and age. There was 1.40 (CI: 1.18,1.61) times the RRI risk during the pandemic compared to prior to the social isolation period. The COVID-19 pandemic influenced runners' behaviors with increased training volume, decreased intensity and motivation, and heightened injury risk. These results provide insights into how physical activity patterns were influenced by large-scale social isolation directives associated with the pandemic.","DeJong, Alexandra F; Fish, Pamela N; Hertel, Jay",PLoS One,,16

Even young adults are attending death cafés to process the premature deaths of others their age.4 Hospitals and nursing schools have adopted these spaces to prevent burnout and share resources on palliative care as health care workers navigate their own losses while taking on caregiver roles with patients.5 Health care providers experienced unprecedented deaths in a short period oftime in the early days of COVID19. Social critiques of ways in which death is handled by the media, our death determination practices, and the practice of medicine can leave some individuals feelingunresolved grief,and some death café participants feel a responsibility to contextualize their grief within current failings.7 For example, a woman whose disabled grandfather died after being denied medical care asked in one death café why some lives are deemed more dispensable than others.","Chang, Michelle B.

296341,"Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC) as a Predecessor of Thromboinflammation and Multiorgan Organ Failure in a Patient with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), A Case Report",2021,"BACKGROUND: The footwear manufacturing industry is one of the significant sectors of leather businesses in India. In the Indian footwear production industry, there is an enormous potential for employment, export, and development. Kolhapuri footwear is a popular handmade craft in India. It is a well-designed craft used by Indian people for many years. Artisans using traditional tools manufacture this footwear manually. Workers of this craft use traditional methods and work in cottage-based enterprises where organized laws and legislations are not applicable. Therefore, any occupational hazard-related documentation is not available. Due to the nature of the job, workers occupy various apparent non-optimal postures that may cause multiple work-related disorders such as musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs). OBJECTIVE: The main objective was to study and assess different footwear manufacturing workstations and working postures. The work further aimed to improve the design of current workstations and evaluate the proposed design using virtual ergonomic assessment techniques. METHODS: An anthropometric database for the Kolhapuri footwear making population was developed. This work measured 35 different body dimensions of the footwear manufacturing artisans. Rapid Upper Limb Assessment (RULA) was used for postural analysis of the artisans. RESULTS: It was observed that the entire footwear making activity was carried out in awkward postures. RULA scores suggested that 'a change in posture' to improve the efficiency of artisans was required for most of the workstations. This work proposed a novel workstation design to reduce the high risk of MSDs. The design was evaluated for thigh clearance, vision analysis and RULA analysis with the help of Digital Human Modelling (DHM). The virtual ergonomics assessment of this design revealed that the vision, thigh clearances, and RULA scores were satisfactory in the new design. CONCLUSION: The anthropometric database proposed in this study is likely to be useful in designing Kolhapuri footwear manufacturing tools. The proposed workstation and work layout are helpful to improve the accessibility of required tools and materials to footwear workers. It also helps to reduce occupational risks by easing uncomfortable work positions.","Jadhav, Ganesh Suresh; Arunachalam, M; Salve, Urmi Ravindra",Work,,16

We aimed to examine whether non-autoimmune diabetes mellitus enhances the risk of virus infections compared with the risk in healthy individuals without non-autoimmune diabetes mellitus. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we assessed case-control and cohort studies on the association between non-autoimmune diabetes and viruses. We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science with no language restriction, to identify articles published until February 15, 2021. The main outcome assessment was the risk of virus infection in individuals with non-autoimmune diabetes. We used a random-effects model to pool individual studies and assessed heterogeneity (I2) using the &#967;2 test on Cochrane's Q statistic. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42019134142. Out of 3136 articles identified, we included 68 articles (90 studies, as the number of virus and or diabetes phenotype varied between included articles). The summary OR between non-autoimmune diabetes and virus infections risk were, 10.8(95% CI: 10.3-11.4; 1-study) for SARS-CoV-2; 3.6(95%CI: 2.7-4.9, I2 = 91.7%; 43-studies) for HCV; 2.7(95% CI: 1.3-5.4, I2 = 89.9%, 8-studies;) for HHV8; 2.1(95% CI: 1.7-2.5; 1-study) for H1N1 virus; 1.6(95% CI: 1.2-2.13, I2 = 98.3%, 27-studies) for HBV; 1.5(95% CI: 1.1-2.0; 1-study) for HSV1; 3.5(95% CI: 0.6-18.3 , I2 = 83.9%, 5-studies) for CMV; 2.9(95% CI: 1-8.7, 1-study) for TTV; 2.6(95% CI: 0.7-9.1, 1-study) for Parvovirus B19; 0.7(95% CI: 0.3-1.5 , 1-study) for coxsackie B virus; and 0.2(95% CI: 0-6.2; 1-study) for HGV. Our findings suggest that, non-autoimmune diabetes is associated with increased susceptibility to viruses especially SARS-CoV-2, HCV, HHV8, H1N1 virus, HBV and HSV1. Thus, these viruses deserve more attention from diabetes health-care providers, researchers, policy makers, and stakeholders for improved detection, overall proper management, and efficient control of viruses in people with non-autoimmune diabetes.","Lontchi-Yimagou, Eric; Feutseu, Charly; Kenmoe, Sebastien; Djomkam Zune, Alexandra Lindsey; Kinyuy Ekali, Solange Fai; Nguewa, Jean Louis; Choukem, Siméon Pierre; Mbanya, Jean Claude; Gautier, Jean Francois; Sobngwi, Eugene",Sci Rep,,16

With prompt and drastic measures, Vietnam is one of the few countries that has largely succeeded in controlling the outbreak. This result is derived from a harmonious combination of many factors, with the policy system playing a key role. This study assessed the policy responses to the COVID-19 pandemic in Vietnam from the early days of the outbreak in January 2020 to 24 July 2020 (with a total of 413 cases confirmed and 99 days of no new cases infected from the local community) by synthesizing and evaluating 959 relevant policy documents in different classifications. The findings show that the Vietnamese policy system responded promptly, proactively, and effectively at multiple authority levels (33 different agencies from the national to provincial governments), using a range of policy tools and measures. Parallel to the daily occurrence of 2.24 new cases, 5.13 new policy documents were issued on average per day over the study period. The pandemic policy response over the first six months in Vietnam were divided into four periods, I (23 January-5 March), II (6-19 March), III (20 March-21 April), and IV (22 April-24 July). This paper synthesizes eight solution groups for these four anti-pandemic phases, including outbreak announcements and steering documents, medical measures, blockade of the schools, emergency responses, border and entry control measures, social isolation and nationwide social isolation measures, financial supports, and other measures. By emphasizing diversification of the policy responses, from the agencies to the tools and measures, the case study reviews and shares lessons from the successful COVID-19 prevention and control in Vietnam that could be useful for other nations.","Le, Tuyet-Anh T; Vodden, Kelly; Wu, Jianghua; Atiwesh, Ghada",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,16

World Health Organization (WHO) named this disease Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The infection has rapidly spread across China to many other countries, and on March 12, 2020 the WHO declared pandemic outbreak of COVID-19. As of May 16, 2020, COVID-19 has been diagnosed in more than 4,490,000 patients, associated to 305,976 deaths worldwide; in Italy 224,760 COVID-19 cases have been reported with 31,763 deaths. The main routes of transmission are respiratory droplets and direct contact with infected people, so numerous prevention strategies are employed to mitigate the spread of disease, including social distancing and isolation. The aim of this narrative review is to underline gender differences in epidemiology, etiopathogenesis, risk factors, clinical presentation, diagnosis, prognosis and mortality of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Currently data on the sex indicators for admitted or deceased patients are only available, but there is no analysis about other gender indicators. The data considered in our study are the only currently available in the literature, but it is appropriate to implement a specific analysis with all gender indicators to identify appropriate strategies.

314335,Association of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Outbreak With Enrollment in Cancer Clinical Trials,2020,"DNA and RNA polymerases (Pols) are central to life, health, and biotechnology because they allow the flow of genetic information in biological systems. Importantly, Pol function and (de)regulation are linked to human diseases, notably cancer (DNA Pols) and viral infections (RNA Pols) such as COVID-19. In addition, Pols are used in various applications such as synthesis of artificial genetic polymers and DNA amplification in molecular biology, medicine, and forensic analysis. Because of all of this, the field of Pols is an intense research area, in which computational studies contribute to elucidating experimentally inaccessible atomistic details of Pol function. In detail, Pols catalyze the replication, transcription, and repair of nucleic acids through the addition, via a nucleotidyl transfer reaction, of a nucleotide to the 3′-end of the growing nucleic acid strand. Here, we analyze how computational methods, including force-field-based molecular dynamics, quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics, and free energy simulations, have advanced our understanding of Pols. We examine the complex interaction of chemical and physical events during Pol catalysis, like metal-aided enzymatic reactions for nucleotide addition and large conformational rearrangements for substrate selection and binding. We also discuss the role of computational approaches in understanding the origin of Pol fidelity—the ability of Pols to incorporate the correct nucleotide that forms a Watson–Crick base pair with the base of the template nucleic acid strand. Finally, we explore how computations can accelerate the discovery of Pol-targeting drugs and engineering of artificial Pols for synthetic and biotechnological applications.

314973,"COVID-19 and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation: experiences as a patient, general practitioner, wife and mother",2021,"BACKGROUND: Disease severity in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may be associated with inoculation dose. This has triggered interest in intubation barrier devices to block droplet exposure; however, aerosol protection with these devices is not known. This study hypothesized that barrier devices reduce aerosol outside of the barrier. METHODS: Aerosol containment in closed, semiclosed, semiopen, and open barrier devices was investigated: (1) ""glove box"" sealed with gloves and caudal drape, (2) ""drape tent"" with a drape placed over a frame, (3) ""slit box"" with armholes and caudal end covered by vinyl slit diaphragms, (4) original ""aerosol box,"" (5) collapsible ""interlocking box,"" (6) ""simple drape"" over the patient, and (7) ""no barrier."" Containment was investigated by (1) vapor instillation at manikin's right arm with video-assisted visual evaluation and (2) submicrometer ammonium sulfate aerosol particles ejected through the manikin's mouth with ventilation and coughs. Samples were taken from standardized locations inside and around the barriers using a particle counter and a mass spectrometer. Aerosol evacuation from the devices was measured using standard hospital suction, a surgical smoke evacuator, and a Shop-Vac. RESULTS: Vapor experiments demonstrated leakage via arm holes and edges. Only closed and semiclosed devices and the aerosol box reduced aerosol particle counts (median [25th, 75th percentile]) at the operator's mouth compared to no barrier (combined median 29 [-11, 56], n = 5 vs. 157 [151, 166], n = 5). The other barrier devices provided less reduction in particle counts (133 [128, 137], n = 5). Aerosol evacuation to baseline required 15 min with standard suction and the Shop-Vac and 5 min with a smoke evacuator. CONCLUSIONS: Barrier devices may reduce exposure to droplets and aerosol. With meticulous tucking, the glove box and drape tent can retain aerosol during airway management. Devices that are not fully enclosed may direct aerosol toward the laryngoscopist. Aerosol evacuation reduces aerosol content inside fully enclosed devices. Barrier devices must be used in conjunction with body-worn personal protective equipment.","Fidler, Richard L; Niedek, Christopher R; Teng, Justin J; Sturgeon, Mary E; Zhang, Qi; Robinowitz, David L; Hirsch, Jan",Anesthesiology,,16

327159,Obstetricians on the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Front Lines and the Confusing World of Personal Protective Equipment,2020,"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is an &#945;-coronavirus causing severe diarrhea and high mortality rates in suckling piglets and posing significant economic impact. PEDV replication is completed and results in a large amount of RNA in the cytoplasm. Stress granules (SGs) are dynamic cytosolic RNA granules formed under various stress conditions, including viral infections. Several previous studies suggested that SGs were involved in the antiviral activity of host cells to limit viral propagation. However, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. This study aimed to delineate the molecular mechanisms regulating the SG response to PEDV infection. SG formation is induced early during PEDV infection, but as infection proceeds, this ability is lost and SGs disappear at late stages of infection (>18 h postinfection). PEDV infection resulted in the cleavage of Ras-GTPase-activating protein-binding protein 1 (G3BP1) mediated by caspase-8. Using mutational analysis, the PEDV-induced cleavage site within G3BP1 was identified, which differed from the 3C protease cleavage site previously identified. Furthermore, G3BP1 cleavage by caspase-8 at D168 and D169 was confirmed in vitro as well as in vivo The overexpression of cleavage-resistant G3BP1 conferred persistent SG formation and suppression of viral replication. Additionally, the knockdown of endogenous G3BP1 abolished SG formation and potentiated viral replication. Taken together, these data provide new insights into novel strategies in which PEDV limits the host stress response and antiviral responses and indicate that caspase-8-mediated G3BP1 cleavage is important in the failure of host defense against PEDV infection.IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses (CoVs) are drawing extensive attention again since the outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in 2019. CoVs are prone to variation and own the transmission capability by crossing the species barrier resulting in reemergence. How CoVs manipulate the antiviral responses of their hosts needs to be explored. Overall, the study provides new insight into how porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) impaired SG assembly by targeting G3BP1 via the host proteinase caspase-8. These findings enhanced the understanding of PEDV infection and might help identify new antiviral targets that could inhibit viral replication and limit the pathogenesis of PEDV.","Sun, Liumei; Chen, Huan; Ming, Xin; Bo, Zongyi; Shin, Hyun-Jin; Jung, Yong-Sam; Qian, Yingjuan",J. virol,,16

328088,Touch Me Not: Safe Distancing in Radiology During Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19),2020,"Objective: The COVID-19 pandemic made it necessary to convert a course on history taking, in theory and practice, to an online format over a very short time. A key question was whether, and if so to what extent, basic theory and, in particular, the practical skills required to conduct medical interviews can be learned online. Methodology/project description: The teaching program in basic theory was didactically redesigned and asynchronously placed on a learning platform, while the practical program, which consisted of training in conducting history-taking interviews, took place with the help of video conferencing software during synchronous sessions. For the practical sessions, the lecturers received organizational and technical support. Results: Based on initial evaluation results, a positive picture of the conversion has emerged since the course was completed. The need to restructure the course and use new teaching methods because of the COVID-19 pandemic was well accepted by lecturers and students, and the course content was successfully adapted to an online format. Conclusion: Overall, the online format enabled the learning objectives of the course to be successfully achieved. For topics such as non-verbal communication, the evaluation results indicated that a classroom format is preferable. Asynchronous theory teaching was generally very well received. Blended learning formats thus represent an appropriate means of teaching how to conduct medical interviews. Overall, online courses on conducting medical interviews provide students with the opportunity to become acquainted with the use of digital formats to conduct doctor-patient interviews, and to develop the relevant skills.","Ullmann-Moskovits, Judith; Farquharson, Maria; Schwär, Miriam; Sennekamp, Monika",GMS J Med Educ,,16

OBJECTIVE: To investigate factors associated with fear of consequences of COVID-19 among people living with a pre-existing medical condition, the autoimmune disease systemic sclerosis (SSc; scleroderma), including country. METHODS: Pre-COVID-19 data from the Scleroderma Patient-centered Intervention Network (SPIN) Cohort were linked to COVID-19 data collected in April 2020. Multivariable linear regression was used to assess factors associated with continuous scores of the 10-item COVID-19 Fears Questionnaire for Chronic Medical Conditions, controlling for pre-COVID-19 anxiety symptoms. RESULTS: Compared to France (Nâ¯=â¯156), COVID-19 Fear scores among participants from the United Kingdom (Nâ¯=â¯50) were 0.12 SD (95% CI 0.03 to 0.21) higher; scores for Canada (Nâ¯=â¯97) and the United States (Nâ¯=â¯128) were higher, but not statistically significant. Greater interference of breathing problems was associated with higher fears due to COVID-19 (Standardized regression coefficientâ¯=â¯0.12, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.23). Participants with higher financial resources adequacy scores had lower COVID-19 Fear scores (Standardized coefficientâ¯=â¯-0.18, 95% CI -0.28 to -0.09). CONCLUSIONS: Fears due to COVID-19 were associated with clinical and functional vulnerabilities in this chronically ill population. This suggests that interventions may benefit from addressing specific clinical issues that apply to specific populations. Financial resources, health policies and political influences may also be important. The needs of people living with chronic illness during a pandemic may differ depending on the social and political context in which they live.","Wu, Yin; Kwakkenbos, Linda; Henry, Richard S; Carrier, Marie-Eve; Gagarine, Maria; Harb, Sami; Bourgeault, Angelica; Tao, Lydia; Carboni-Jiménez, Andrea; Negeri, Zelalem; Patten, Scott; Bartlett, Susan J; Mouthon, Luc; Varga, John; Benedetti, Andrea; Thombs, Brett D",J Psychosom Res,,16

342102,Multi-institutional Analysis of 100 Consecutive Patients with COVID-19 and Severe Pulmonary Compromise Treated with Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation: Outcomes and Trends Over Time,2021,"BACKGROUND: Recent psychological research into the effects of COVID-19 has focused largely on understanding excessive fear reactions (""over-responses""). Equally important, but neglected phenomena concern ""under-responses"", in which people downplay the significance of COVID-19. People who do not take the pandemic seriously may be less likely to adhere to social distancing policies. The present study is, to our knowledge, the first to investigate the differential predictors of over- and under-responses to COVID-19. METHODS: A large community sample from the United States and Canada (N = 6,854) completed measures of beliefs associated with over- and under-responses, along with measures of distress, excessive avoidance, and nonadherence to social distancing. Over-response beliefs were assessed by scales measuring beliefs about the dangerousness of COVID-19 (personal health and socio-economic threats) and COVID-19-related xenophobia (beliefs that foreigners are spreading the virus). Under-response beliefs were assessed by scales measuring beliefs that the threat of COVID-19 has been exaggerated, and beliefs that one is sufficiently healthy to be robust against the effects of COVID-19. RESULTS: In regression analyses, medium or large effects were obtained whereby over-response beliefs predicted distress (including distress associated with self-isolation) and excessive avoidance during the pandemic, whereas under-response beliefs predicted the disregard for social distancing. LIMITATIONS: This study relied on self-reported cross-sectional data and focused on extreme forms of disregard for social distancing guidelines, CONCLUSION: : It is important to understand under-responses to COVID-19 and how these relate to distress, excessive avoidance, and nonadherence to social distancing. Implications for addressing the problems of over- and under-response are discussed.","Taylor, Steven; Landry, Caeleigh A; Paluszek, Michelle M; Asmundson, Gordon J G",J Affect Disord,,16

Materials and Methods In this cross-sectional study, 90 children under 15 years of age were randomly selected from suspects of COVID-19 referred to the Tabriz Children Hospital, the main pediatric COVID-19 diagnostic center of Tabriz, from May 21, 2020 to June 21, 2020. Blood and nasopharyngeal samples were taken simultaneously at the referring time. The diagnostic accuracy of ELISA-based IgM and IgG antibody tests for COVID-19 were compared with the rRT-PCR. Results The calculated sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio, overall diagnostic accuracy, and diagnostic odds ratio were 0.5745, 0.9767, 0.9643, 0.6774, 24.66, 0.4357, 0.7667, and 56.60 for IgM;and 0.6170, 0.9302, 0.9355, 0.6897, 8.84, 0.4117, 0.7667, and 21.47 for IgG, respectively. Conclusion Due to the lower sensitivity of antibody detection-based serological tests compared to rRT-PCR, they cannot be considered as initial and reliable tests for the diagnosis of COVID-19. It can be suggested that the serological tests be only used as complementary tests to rRT-PCR or for monitoring the immune response of children with COVID-19.","Tarmahi, V.; Afghan, M.; Raeisi, S.; Nodeh, H.

We may underestimate asymptomatic people or persons with atypical COVID-19 symptoms who may spread the disease. Objective: A large screening campaign was launched all over France in several retirement homes in order to screen asymptomatic persons for SARS-CoV-2 to isolate carriers from other residents. Methods: From April 24th to 27th 2020, mobile teams of nurses from the Hôtel-Dieu Hospital were sent to five Parisian nursing homes to conduct SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR screening tests among all asymptomatic. Results: This cross-sectional study included 297 residents: 274 asymptomatic participants (92.3%) were tested for COVID-19, mostly women (n=249/274), median age was 90 (IQR 95% [86-94]) with females being significantly older than males (90 versus 88 years, p= 0.028). A total of 35 residents (12.8%) were tested positive for COVID-19: 29 women (11.7%) and six men (24%).

346619,Planning and coordination of the radiological response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic: the Singapore experience,2020,"BACKGROUND: Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at the front line of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. Comprehensively evaluating SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among HCWs in a large healthcare system could help identify the impact that epidemiological factors and presence of symptoms have on immune response to the infection over time. AIM: To determine the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies among healthcare workers (HCWs), to identify associated epidemiological factors and to study antibody kinetics. METHODS: We completed a longitudinal evaluation of the seroprevalence and epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies in approximately 30,000 HCWs in the largest healthcare system in the State of Connecticut. FINDINGS: The baseline prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibody among 6,863 HCWs was 6.3% (95% CI: 5.7%-6.9%) and was highest among patient care support (16.7%), medical assistants (9.1%), and nurses (8.2%) and lower for physicians (3.8%) and advanced practice providers (4.5%). Seroprevalence was significantly higher among African Americans (OR 3.26 compared to Caucasians, 95% CI 1.77-5.99), in participants with at least one COVID symptom (OR 3.00, 95% CI 1.92-4.68), and in those reporting prior quarantine (OR 3.83, 95% CI 2.57-5.70). No symptoms were reported in 24% of the seropositive participants. Among the 47% who returned for a follow-up serology test, the seroreversion rate was 39.5% and the seroconversion rate was 2.2%. The incidence of reinfection in the seropositive group was zero. CONCLUSION: Although there is a decline in the IgG antibody signal over time, 60.5% of the seropositive HCWs maintain their seroconversion status after a median time of 5.5 months.","Papasavas, Pavlos; Olugbile, Sope; Wu, Ulysses; Robinson, Kenneth; Roberts, Amity L; O039,; Sullivan, David M; McLaughlin, Tara; Mather, Jeffrey F; Steinberg, Adam C; Orlando, Rocco; Kumar, Ajay",J. hosp. infect,,16
348185,Commentary: A survey of UK cardiac surgeons' opinions during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic: A point and place in time,2020,"BACKGROUND: The occurrence of chemoresistance is a common problem in tumor treatment. Circular RNA (circRNA) has been confirmed to be related to tumor chemoresistance. However, the role and the underlying molecular mechanism of hsa_circ_0004674 in the chemoresistance of osteosarcoma (OS) are still unclear. METHODS: The expression of hsa_circ_0004674, miR-342-3p, and fibrillin-1 (FBN1) was determined by qRT-PCR. Cell counting kit 8 assay was used to evaluate the doxorubicin (DXR) resistance of cells. The proliferation and apoptosis of cells were measured using colony formation assay and flow cytometry. Western blot analysis was utilized to examine the protein levels of resistance markers, Wnt/ß-catenin pathway markers and FBN1. The interaction between miR-342-3p and hsa_circ_0004674 or FBN1 was confirmed by dual-luciferase reporter assay and RNA pull-down assay. Moreover, animal experiments were performed to assess the effect of hsa_circ_0004674 silencing on the DXR sensitive of OS in vivo. RESULTS: The upregulated hsa_circ_0004674 was found in DXR-resistant OS tissues and cells. Knockdown of hsa_circ_0004674 could inhibit the DXR resistance of OS cells in vitro and promote the DXR sensitive of OS tumors in vivo. In addition, we discovered that hsa_circ_0004674 could sponge miR-342-3p, and miR-342-3p could target FBN1. MiR-342-3p inhibitor could reverse the inhibition effect of hsa_circ_0004674 knockdown on the DXR resistance of OS cells. Similarly, the suppressive effect of miR-342-3p on the DXR resistance of OS cells also could be reversed by FBN1 overexpression. Furthermore, we revealed that hsa_circ_0004674 silencing inhibited the activity of Wnt/ß-catenin pathway by the miR-342-3p/FBN1 axis. CONCLUSION: Hsa_circ_0004674 facilitated the DXR resistance of OS through Wnt/ß-catenin pathway via regulating the miR-342-3p/FBN1 axis, suggesting that hsa_circ_0004674 was a promising target for the chemoresistance of OS.","Bai, Yumei; Li, Yanghua; Bai, Juan; Zhang, Yumei",J Orthop Surg Res,,16

Psychological wellbeing among individuals worldwide has been negatively affected by the pandemic especially in low- and middle-income countries such as Bangladesh. The present study aimed to assess the estimate of depressive symptoms and investigated its associations with COVID-19 preventive practice measures, daily activities in home quarantine, and suicidal behaviors in a large-scale Bangladeshi online survey. METHODS: An online-based cross-sectional survey was widely distributed to Bangladeshi citizens. A total of 13,654 participants (61.0% male; mean age = 24.0 years [SD = 6.0]; age range 18-65 years) completed the survey between May and June (2020). The survey included socio-demographics and COVID-19-related questions, along with lifestyle, suicidal, and psychometric measures. Hierarchical regression was performed to determine significant associations between depression and examined variables. RESULTS: The estimate of depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic was 43.5%. Based on hierarchical regression analysis, depression was significantly associated with not engaging in COVID-19 preventive measures, daily activities in home quarantine (e.g., playing videogames), and suicidal behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: Depressive symptoms appeared to be high during the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh. To fight against the pandemic, mental health issues as well as physical health issues need to be taken into consideration.","Islam, Md Saiful; Tasnim, Rafia; Sujan, Md Safaet Hossain; Ferdous, Most Zannatul; Sikder, Md Tajuddin; Masud, Jakir Hossain Bhuiyan; Kundu, Sourav; Tahsin, Promi; Mosaddek, Abu Syed Md; Griffiths, Mark D",BMC Psychiatry,,16

A primer for intensivists,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) infection is a global health threat. To inform the liver community on the potential relevance of COVID-19, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of published data on liver injury in patients with COVID-19 infection. METHODS: We searched PubMed and Google Scholar through 22 March according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Pooled data were analyzed by using random-effects meta-analyses. RESULTS: A total of 14 studies combining data from 2.871 patients were identified. The prevalence of pre-existing liver disease was reported at 3.1%. The pooled prevalence of elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) levels were 26% [95% confidence interval (CI), 20-32%] and 19% (95% CI, 14-26%), respectively. Only two studies reported the prevalence of elevated liver function tests according to normal ward versus ICU and here the frequency of elevated levels of AST was 50% and 62% versus ALT 40.8% and thus quantitatively higher in ICU-treated patients. Mean levels of absolute AST levels were 33 U/L (95% CI, 30.21-36.09), while mean ALT levels were 31 U/L (95% CI, 27.52-34.57). Cholestatic liver function tests were only incompletely reported in 510 patients. Here, mean levels of alkaline phosphatase were 71 U/L across three studies, and mean levels of gamma-glutamyl transferase were 40.6 U/L across four studies. CONCLUSIONS: Emerging data on LFTs in COVID-19 are heterogeneous indicating mild LFTs involvement in every fourth to fifth patients with numerical more prevalent AST over ALT elevations. Prospective studies are needed to define the clinical relevance of liver injury in COVID-19.","Labenz, Christian; Toenges, Gerrit; Wörns, Marcus-Alexander; Sprinzl, Martin F; Galle, Peter R; Schattenberg, Jörn M",Eur. j. gastroenterol. hepatol,,16

It is important to reflect on our stories, identify the myriad of emotions we are experiencing, and find ways to work through our feelings. Ignoring, denying, or suppressing feelings does not serve us well in the long run. Stifling negative emotions does not make them go away.

All the patients were confirmed by nucleic acid detection, the average age of whom was 45.25 years (range, 23-79 years). Most patients had a history of Wuhan traveling or had contact with Wuhan travelers or infected cases. Obvious family cluster was observed. Clinical manifestations included fever (12/12), fatigue (10/12), cough (6/12), sore throat (4/12), headache (3/12), and diarrhea (2/12). Only three out of eight patients had pneumonia manifestation on radiography. Most patients had a normal white blood cell (WBC) count and normal or reduced lymphocyte (LY) count. Pneumonia changes were observed in all the four patients who underwent a chest CT scan. Only one elderly patient developed severe pneumonia, while all the rest were mild disease and had a self-limiting course.","Du, Na; Chen, Haiying; Zhang, Qing; Che, Lihe; Lou, Lixin; Li, Xiaohua; Zhang, Kaiyu; Bao, Wanguo",Virulence,,16

Travelers in many cases shifted to other transport modes, especially walking and cycling, for minimizing the risk of infection. This study attempts to investigate the impact that COVID-19 had on travelers' perceptions towards bike-sharing systems and whether the pandemic could result in a greater or lesser share of trips that are being conducted through shared bikes. For that reason, a questionnaire survey was carried out in the city of Thessaloniki, Greece, and the responses of 223 people were analyzed statistically. The results of the analysis show that COVID-19 will not affect significantly the number of people using bike-sharing for their trips. However, for a proportion of people, bike-sharing is now more attractive. Moreover, the results indicate that bike-sharing is now more likely to become a more preferable mobility option for people who were previously commuting with private cars as passengers (not as drivers) and people who were already registered users in a bike-sharing system. The results also provide evidence about the importance of safety towards COVID-19 for engaging more users in bike-sharing, in order to provide them with a safe mobility option and contribute to the city's resilience and sustainability.","Nikiforiadis, A.; Ayfantopoulou, G.; Stamelou, A.",Sustainability,,16

The objective of EASY-NET is to evaluate the effectiveness of the audit and feedback (A&F) strategies in different clinical and organizational settings in seven regions. As a negative consequence of the COVID-19 epidemic, the activities of the project have suddenly slowed down; nevertheless, the COVID-19 epidemic represented an opportunity to apply the A&F methodology and support the healthcare within the regional authorities in order to manage and monitor the impact of this new disease. The reaction to the crisis on behalf of EASY-NET was inconsistent across the participating regions for various reasons. Factors which influenced the reaction levels in relation to the rapidity and efficiency of the implementation of the A&F strategies were as follows: the varying epidemiological impact of the COVID-19 epidemic in the various territories, the different clinical and organizational context and availability of expert research teams together with A&F procedures which had already been tested before the start of the epidemic.","Agabiti, Nera; Acampora, Anna; Angelici, Laura; Di Blasio, Norina; Ciccone, Giovannino; Pagano, Eva; Grilli, Roberto; Di Martino, Mirko; Marinacci, Chiara; Valent, Francesca; Davoli, Marina",Epidemiol Prev,,16

Nucleic acids are important biological cues that encode information about organismal identity and clinically relevant phenotypes such as drug resistance. We recently developed a strategy to design nucleic acid-responsive materials using the CRISPR-associated nuclease Cas12a as a user-programmable sensor and material actuator. This approach improves on the sensitivity of current DNA-responsive materials while enabling their rapid repurposing toward new sequence targets. Here, we provide a comprehensive resource for the design, synthesis and actuation of CRISPR-responsive hydrogels. First, we provide guidelines for the synthesis of Cas12a guide RNAs (gRNAs) for in vitro applications. We then outline methods for the synthesis of both polyethylene glycol-DNA (PEG-DNA) and polyacrylamide-DNA (PA-DNA) hydrogels, as well as their controlled degradation using Cas12a for the release of cargos, including small molecules, enzymes, nanoparticles and living cells within hours. Finally, we detail the design and assembly of microfluidic paper-based devices that use Cas12a-sensitive hydrogels to convert DNA inputs into a variety of visual and electronic readouts for use in diagnostics. Following the initial validation of the gRNA and Cas12a components (1 d), the synthesis and testing of either PEG-DNA or PA-DNA hydrogels require 3-4 d of laboratory time. Optional extensions, including the release of primary human cells or the design of the paper-based diagnostic, require an additional 2-3 d each.","Gayet, Raphael V; de Puig, Helena; English, Max A; Soenksen, Luis R; Nguyen, Peter Q; Mao, Angelo S; Angenent-Mari, Nicolaas M; Collins, James J",Nat Protoc,,16

Improvements in 9 of the 82 dystonia patients (BSP, CD, OMD) consisted of a perceived decrease in dystonic activity. 33% of dystonia patients had previously noticed or used a sensory trick. Its presence turned out to be a significant predictor of improvement during mask wearing. Deteriorations were attributed from all patients to disturbing effects of the mask interacting with facial muscle overactivity. Improvements in HSF patients were attributed to the symptom-hiding nature of the mask and not to an effect on the spasm activity itself.ConclusionsWearing a face mask did not affect self-perceived symptoms in 80% of patients with craniofacial hyperkinesis. 11% of patients reported an improvement, which occurred as sensory trick in dystonia patients and as a concealment of a stigmatizing facial expression in patients with HSF.","Erbguth, Frank Lange Rüdiger",Neurological Research and Practice,,16

Many clinical and experimental findings suggest the role of inflammatory mechanisms in the immunopathology of COVID-19. Hence, cellular and molecular mediators of the immune system can be potential targets for predicting, monitoring, and treating the progressive complications of COVID-19. In this review, we assess the latest cellular and molecular data on the immunopathology of COVID-19 according to the pathological evidence (e.g., mucus and surfactants), dysregulations of pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators (e.g., cytokines and chemokines), and impairments of innate and acquired immune system functions (e.g., mononuclear cells, neutrophils and antibodies). Furthermore, we determine the significance of immune biomarkers for predicting, monitoring, and treating the progressive complications of COVID-19. We also discuss the clinical importance of recent immune biomarkers in COVID-19, and at the end of each section, recent clinical trials in immune biomarkers for COVID-19 are mentioned.","Fouladseresht, Hamed; Doroudchi, Mehrnoosh; Rokhtabnak, Najmeh; Abdolrahimzadehfard, Hossein; Roudgari, Amir; Sabetian, Golnar; Paydar, Shahram",Cytokine Growth Factor Rev,,16

Vaccine misconception was declared by WHO as one of the top 10 health issues in 2019. Here we test the effectiveness of applying debunking to combat vaccine misinformation, and reduce vaccine hesitancy. Methods Participants were recruited via a daily news show on Dutch Television, targeted to elderly viewers. The study was conducted in 980 elderly citizens during the October 2020 National Influenza Vaccination Campaign. Borrowing from the recent literature in behavioural science and psychology we conducted a two-arm randomized blinded parallel study, in which participants were allocated to exposure to a video containing social norms, vaccine information plus debunking of vaccination myths (intervention group, n = 505) or a video only containing vaccine information plus social norm (control group, n = 475). Participants who viewed either of the video's and completed both a pre- and post-intervention survey on vaccination trust and knowledge, were included in the analysis. The main outcomes of this study were improvement on vaccine knowledge and awareness. Findings Participants were recruited from the 13th of October 2020 till the 16th of October 2020 and could immediately participate in the pre-intervention survey. Subsequently, eligible participants were randomly assigned to an interventional video and the follow-up survey, distributed through email on the 18th of October 2020, and available for participation till the 24th of October 2020. We found that exposure to the video with addition of debunking strategies on top of social norm modelling and information resulted in substantially stronger rejection of vaccination misconceptions, including the belief that: (1) vaccinations can cause Autism Spectrum Disorders;(2) vaccinations weaken the immune system;(3) influenza vaccination would hamper the COVID-19 vaccine efficacy. Additionally, we observed that exposure to debunking in the intervention resulted in enhanced trust in government. Interpretation Utilizing debunking in media campaigns on top of vaccine information and social norm modeling is an effective means to combat misinformation and distrust associated with vaccination in elderly, and could help maximize grounds for the acceptance of vaccines, including the COVID-19 vaccines.

403367,Enhancing thoracic surgical trainee competence in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) era: Challenges and opportunities for mentorship,2020,"Background As several COVID-19 vaccines are rolled-out globally, it has become important to develop an effective strategy for vaccine acceptance, especially in high-risk groups, such as elderly Vaccine misconception was declared by WHO as one of the top 10 health issues in 2019 Here we test the effectiveness of applying debunking to combat vaccine misinformation, and reduce vaccine hesitancy Methods Participants were recruited via a daily news show on Dutch Television, targeted to elderly viewers The study was conducted in 980 elderly citizens during the October 2020 National Influenza Vaccination Campaign Borrowing from the recent literature in behavioural science and psychology we conducted a two-arm randomized blinded parallel study, in which participants were allocated to exposure to a video containing social norms, vaccine information plus debunking of vaccination myths (intervention group, n = 505) or a video only containing vaccine information plus social norm (control group, n = 475) Participants who viewed either of the video's and completed both a pre- and post-intervention survey on vaccination trust and knowledge, were included in the analysis The main outcomes of this study were improvement on vaccine knowledge and awareness Findings Participants were recruited from the 13th of October 2020 till the 16th of October 2020 and could immediately participate in the pre-intervention survey Subsequently, eligible participants were randomly assigned to an interventional video and the follow-up survey, distributed through email on the 18th of October 2020, and available for participation till the 24th of October 2020 We found that exposure to the video with addition of debunking strategies on top of social norm modelling and information resulted in substantially stronger rejection of vaccination misconceptions, including the belief that: (1) vaccinations can cause Autism Spectrum Disorders;(2) vaccinations weaken the immune system;(3) influenza vaccination would hamper the COVID-19 vaccine efficacy Additionally, we observed that exposure to debunking in the intervention resulted in enhanced trust in government Interpretation Utilizing debunking in media campaigns on top of vaccine information and social norm modeling is an effective means to combat misinformation and distrust associated with vaccination in elderly, and could help maximize grounds for the acceptance of vaccines, including the COVID-19 vaccines Funding Dutch Influenza Foundation","Yousuf, Hamza van der Linden Sander Bredius Luke van Essen G.

409851,Preparing for the Most Critically Ill Patients With COVID-19: The Potential Role of Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation,2020,"Computing derivatives of noisy measurement data is ubiquitous in the physical, engineering, and biological sciences, and it is often a critical step in developing dynamic models or designing control. Unfortunately, the mathematical formulation of numerical differentiation is typically ill-posed, and researchers often resort to an \textit{ad hoc} process for choosing one of many computational methods and its parameters. In this work, we take a principled approach and propose a multi-objective optimization framework for choosing parameters that minimize a loss function to balance the faithfulness and smoothness of the derivative estimate. Our framework has three significant advantages. First, the task of selecting multiple parameters is reduced to choosing a single hyper-parameter. Second, where ground-truth data is unknown, we provide a heuristic for automatically selecting this hyper-parameter based on the power spectrum and temporal resolution of the data. Third, the optimal value of the hyper-parameter is consistent across different differentiation methods, thus our approach unifies vastly different numerical differentiation methods and facilitates unbiased comparison of their results. Finally, we provide an extensive open-source Python library \texttt{pynumdiff} to facilitate easy application to diverse datasets (https://github.com/florisvb/PyNumDiff).","Breugel, Floris van; Kutz, J.

410698,Characteristics and Quality of US Nursing Homes Reporting Cases of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19),2020,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The role of schools in the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the community is still controversial. The objective of our study was to describe the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 infections in different pediatric age groups during the first 2 months of the fall back-to-school period, in the context of increasing viral transmission in France. METHODS: Weekly epidemiological data provided by Santé Publique France and the Ministry of National Education were analyzed according to the age groups defined by the different school levels. Weeks (W) 34-42 were considered for analysis. RESULTS: The PCR positivity rate and incidence rate increased in all age groups during the study period, in an age-dependent manner. At W42, with adults being considered as reference, the risk ratio for a positive PCR test was 0.46 [95% CI: 0.44-0.49] and 0.69 [0.68-0.70] for children aged 0-5 years and 6-17 years, respectively. Similarly, the incidence rate ratio was 0.09 [0.08-0.09], 0.31 [0.30-0.32], 0.64 [0.63-0.66], and 1.07 [1.05-1.10] for children aged 0-5 years, 6-10 years, 11-14 years, and 15-17 years, respectively. Children and adolescents accounted for 1.9% of the newly hospitalized patients between W34 and W42, and for 1.3% of new intensive care admissions. No death was observed. Among infected children and adolescents, the percentage of asymptomatic individuals was 57% at W34 and 48% at W42. The number of schools closed remained low, less than 1% throughout the study period. The number of confirmed cases among school staff was consistent with the data measured in the general population. CONCLUSION: In the context of increasing viral transmission in the population, the spread among children and adolescents remained lower than that observed among adults, despite keeping schools open. However, the impact was age-dependent, with data in high schools close to those observed in adults.","Gras-Le Guen, C; Cohen, R; Rozenberg, J; Launay, E; Levy-Bruhl, D; Delacourt, C",Arch Pediatr,,16

Although the risk of COVID-19 infection is not increased in patients with inherited bleeding disorders, the indirect effects of this infection are many. METHODS: A cross sectional survey was conducted among patients registered to our centre with inherited bleeding disorders. A web-based based questionnaire was developed and shared with patients and families. RESULTS: 120 patients/ families answered the questionnaire completely. During the period of lockdown, many had bleeds that were left untreated due to either difficulty in travel or unavailability of treatment. The time to treatment ranged from 8 h to 15 days in those who had a bleed. 36 % faced financial difficulties and 40 % families reported losing their job or source of income during this period. DISCUSSION: Few solutions that emerged while treating patients during this period and recommendations are discussed. Even though haemophilia has been included under the essential health services and states mandated to continue treatment for these patients despite the global crisis, patients still face challenges in terms of transport and finance.","Radhakrishnan, Nita; Shankar, Ravi; Singh, Savitri; Rana, Megha",Transfus Apher Sci,,16

414892,Data-Driven and Machine-Learning Methods to Project Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic Trend in Eastern Mediterranean,2021,"PURPOSE: To describe the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of caregivers and survivors of transient ischaemic attack (TIA) and stroke during one year post discharge in comparison to age- and sex-matched population norms; and to analyse the association of initial stroke severity, measured by a routinely used stroke-specific scale, on subsequent HRQoL of caregivers and survivors. METHODS: Cohort of hospitalized patients with TIA and stroke discharged alive from a large university hospital in Norway, and their informal caregivers. Questionnaires at 3 and 12 months post discharge were filled out by caregivers (n = 320 and n = 326, respectively) and survivors (n = 368 and n = 383, respectively). Multivariable linear regression analyses tested associations between initial stroke severity (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, NIHSS) and HRQoL (EQ-5D-3L) in caregivers and survivors. RESULTS: Caregivers of survivors with TIA or stroke did not report lower HRQoL than matched norms. There was some evidence of an association of the NIHSS with caregiver HRQoL at 3 months only (age-sex-adjusted coefficient - 0.01, p = 0.008), however, this was attenuated after additional adjustments. Survivors with stroke, but not TIA, reported lower HRQoL than population norms at both time points. There was a negative association between higher NIHSS scores and survivors' HRQoL; fully adjusted coefficient - 0.01 at both time points (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: The informal caregivers and survivors with TIA did not report lower than expected HRQoL. Increasing stroke severity was associated with decreasing HRQoL among survivors, but had limited predictive value among caregivers. Other factors may therefore be better indicators of 'at risk' caregivers.","Labberton, Angela S; Augestad, Liv Ariane; Thommessen, Bente; Barra, Mathias",Qual. life res,,16

421011,Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation in Intensive Care Unit Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019,2020,"BACKGROUND: In December 2019, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak occurred in Wuhan. Data on the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with severe COVID-19 are limited. OBJECTIVE: We sought to evaluate the severity on admission, complications, treatment, and outcomes of patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Patients with COVID-19 admitted to Tongji Hospital from January 26, 2020, to February 5, 2020, were retrospectively enrolled and followed-up until March 3, 2020. Potential risk factors for severe COVID-19 were analyzed by a multivariable binary logistic model. Cox proportional hazard regression model was used for survival analysis in severe patients. RESULTS: We identified 269 (49.1%) of 548 patients as severe cases on admission. Older age, underlying hypertension, high cytokine levels (IL-2R, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-&#945;), and high lactate dehydrogenase level were significantly associated with severe COVID-19 on admission. The prevalence of asthma in patients with COVID-19 was 0.9%, markedly lower than that in the adult population of Wuhan. The estimated mortality was 1.1% in nonsevere patients and 32.5% in severe cases during the average 32 days of follow-up period. Survival analysis revealed that male sex, older age, leukocytosis, high lactate dehydrogenase level, cardiac injury, hyperglycemia, and high-dose corticosteroid use were associated with death in patients with severe COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with older age, hypertension, and high lactate dehydrogenase level need careful observation and early intervention to prevent the potential development of severe COVID-19. Severe male patients with heart injury, hyperglycemia, and high-dose corticosteroid use may have a high risk of death.","Li, Xiaochen; Xu, Shuyun; Yu, Muqing; Wang, Ke; Tao, Yu; Zhou, Ying; Shi, Jing; Zhou, Min; Wu, Bo; Yang, Zhenyu; Zhang, Cong; Yue, Junqing; Zhang, Zhiguo; Renz, Harald; Liu, Xiansheng; Xie, Jungang; Xie, Min; Zhao, Jianping",J Allergy Clin Immunol,,16

422701,Demand for Self-Managed Online Telemedicine Abortion in the United States During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: A student mental health crisis is increasingly acknowledged and will only intensify with the COVID-19 crisis. Given accessibility of methods with demonstrated efficacy in reducing depression and anxiety (eg, mindfulness meditation and cognitive behavioral therapy [CBT]) and limitations imposed by geographic obstructions and localized expertise, web-based alternatives have become vehicles for scaled-up delivery of benefits at modest cost. Mindfulness Virtual Community (MVC), a web-based program informed by CBT constructs and featuring online videos, discussion forums, and videoconferencing, was developed to target depression, anxiety, and experiences of excess stress among university students. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of an 8-week web-based mindfulness and CBT program in reducing symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress (primary outcomes) and increasing mindfulness (secondary outcome) within a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with undergraduate students at a large Canadian university. METHODS: An RCT was designed to assess undergraduate students (n=160) who were randomly allocated to a web-based guided mindfulness-CBT condition (n=80) or to a waitlist control (WLC) condition (n=80). The 8-week intervention consisted of a web-based platform comprising (1) 12 video-based modules with psychoeducation on students' preidentified life challenges and applied mindfulness practice; (2) anonymous peer-to-peer discussion forums; and (3) anonymous, group-based, professionally guided 20-minute live videoconferences. The outcomes (depression, anxiety, stress, and mindfulness) were measured via an online survey at baseline and at 8 weeks postintervention using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ9), the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), and the Five Facets Mindfulness Questionnaire Short Form (FFMQ-SF). Analyses employed generalized estimation equation methods with AR(1) covariance structures and were adjusted for possible covariates (gender, age, country of birth, ethnicity, English as first language, paid work, unpaid work, relationship status, physical exercise, self-rated health, and access to private mental health counseling). RESULTS: Of the 159 students who provided T1 data, 32 were males and 125 were females with a mean age of 22.55 years. Participants in the MVC (n=79) and WLC (n=80) groups were similar in sociodemographic characteristics at T1 with the exception of gender and weekly hours of unpaid volunteer work. At postintervention follow-up, according to the adjusted comparisons, there were statistically significant between-group reductions in depression scores (ß=-2.21, P=.01) and anxiety scores (ß=-4.82, P=.006), and a significant increase in mindfulness scores (ß=4.84, P=.02) compared with the WLC group. There were no statistically significant differences in perceived stress for MVC (ß=.64, P=.48) compared with WLC. CONCLUSIONS: With the MVC intervention, there were significantly reduced depression and anxiety symptoms but no significant effect on perceived stress. Online mindfulness interventions can be effective in addressing common mental health conditions among postsecondary populations on a large scale, simultaneously reducing the current burden on traditional counseling services.

We describe demographic features, treatments and clinical outcomes in the International Severe Acute Respiratory and emerging Infection Consortium (ISARIC) COVID-19 cohort, the worlds largest international, standardised cohort of hospitalised patients. MethodsThe dataset analysed includes COVID-19 patients hospitalised between January 2020 and May 2021. We investigated how symptoms on admission, comorbidities, risk factors, and treatments varied by age, sex, and other characteristics. We used Cox proportional hazards models to investigate associations between demographics, symptoms, comorbidities, and other factors with risk of death, admission to intensive care unit (ICU), and invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). Findings439,922 patients with laboratory-confirmed (91.7%) or clinically-diagnosed (8.3%) SARS-CoV-2 infection from 49 countries were enrolled. Age (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] per 10 years 1.49 [95% CI 1.49-1.50]) and male sex (1.26 [1.24-1.28]) were associated with a higher risk of death. Rates of admission to ICU and use of IMV increased with age up to age 60, then dropped. Symptoms, comorbidities, and treatments varied by age and had varied associations with clinical outcomes. Tuberculosis was associated with an 86% higher risk of death, and HIV with an 87% higher risk of death. Case fatality ratio varied by country partly due to differences in the clinical characteristics of recruited patients.

We identified 78 studies, with data from 77,443 people (1) predominantly from China. We could not find any studies including data from low and middle-income countries. We repeated our search on 18 Aug 2021 but could not identify any further studies that met our inclusion criteria. Added value of this studyOur study uses standardised clinical data collection to collect data from a vast number of patients across the world, including patients from low-, middle-, and high-income countries. The size of our database gives us great confidence in the accuracy of our descriptions of the global impact of COVID-19. We can confirm findings reported by smaller, country-specific studies and compare clinical data between countries. We have demonstrated that it is possible to collect large volumes of standardised clinical data during a pandemic of a novel acute respiratory infection. The results provide a valuable resource for present policymakers and future global health researchers. Implications of all the available evidencePresenting symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients requiring hospitalisation are now well-described globally, with the most common being fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Other symptoms also commonly occur, including altered consciousness in older adults and gastrointestinal symptoms in younger patients, and age can influence the likelihood of a patient having symptoms that match one or more case definitions. There are geographic and temporal variations in the case fatality rate (CFR), but overall, CFR was 20.6% in this large international cohort of hospitalised patients with a median age of 60 years (IQR: 45 to 74 years).","Group, - ISARIC Clinical Characterisation; Kartsonaki, Christiana",,,16

We surveyed electronic dance music (EDM) partygoers-a population known for high levels of drug use-to determine whether their drug use patterns had changed during state-mandated social distancing in New York. Methods: Individuals were recruited online and screened for eligibility throughout April and May 2020. We surveyed 128 eligible adults and queried, retrospectively, whether their drug use behavior had changed during COVID-19-related social distancing. Results: Most participants reporting past-three-month use reported decreased frequency of use during COVID-19-related social distancing. Specifically, 78.6% reduced frequency of use of cocaine, 71.1% reduced frequency of use of ecstasy/MDMA/Molly, and 68.0% reduced frequency of use of LSD. Although some participants reported increased frequency of use of cocaine (7.1%), ecstasy (7.9%), or LSD (12.0%), 35.0% reported increased frequency of cannabis use. Most (66.7%) of those reporting cocaine use reduced the amount used. The majority of those reporting use of cannabis, ecstasy, cocaine, and/or LSD reported that drug cost (80.0-84.0%) and drug quality (84.2-92.0%) did not change during social distancing. Having a college degree was associated with higher odds for decreasing frequency of cannabis use. Older participants (ages &#8805;23) were at lower odds for decreasing frequency of cocaine use, as were those earning >$500 per week, and participants who attended EDM events biweekly or more often were at higher odds for decreasing frequency of LSD use. Conclusions: Participants in this sample tended to reduce party drug use during COVID-19-related social distancing.","Palamar, Joseph J; Le, Austin; Acosta, Patricia",Subst Use Misuse,,16

425969,SARS-CoV-2: First Do No Harm,2020,"BACKGROUND: There is currently considerable international debate around school closures/openings and the role of children in the transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Whilst evidence suggests that children are not impacted by COVID-19 as severely as adults, little is still known about their transmission potential, and with a lot of asymptomatic cases they may be silent transmitters (i.e. infectious without showing clinical signs of disease), albeit at a lower level than adults. In relation to this, it is somewhat concerning that in many countries children are cared for, or are often in close contact with, older individuals such as grandparents â the age group most at risk of acquiring serious respiratory complications resulting in death. MAIN TEXT: We emphasise that in the absence of a vaccine or an effective therapeutic drug, preventive measures such as good hygiene practices â hand washing, cough etiquette, disinfection of surfaces and social distancing represent the major (in fact only) weapons that we have against COVID-19. Accordingly, we stress that there is a pressing need to develop specific COVID-19 prevention messages for schoolchildren. CONCLUSION: An entertainment education intervention for schoolchildren systematically implemented in schools would be highly effective and fill this need. With such measures in place there would be greater confidence around the opening of schools.","Gray, Darren J; Kurscheid, Johanna; Mationg, Mary Lorraine; Williams, Gail M; Gordon, Catherine; Kelly, Matthew; Wangdi, Kinley; McManus, Donald P",Infect Dis Poverty,,16
427173,Examining Inequities Associated With Changes in Obstetric and Gynecologic Care Delivery During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic,2020,"The coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak poses unique challenges for psychotherapists and other mental health professionals. The widespread fear, helplessness, illness and death, economic hardship, and disruption of social support caused by the pandemic will create a global need for both supportive crisis counseling and formal mental health treatment. As physical distancing aimed at reducing contagion sharply limits in-person contact, psychotherapists have suddenly been forced to adopt new technologies and learn to provide telepsychotherapy. At this same time, psychotherapists must contend with their own stressors as part of the pandemic-exposed population. We integrate several different literatures to outline how telepsychotherapy can help psychotherapists address patient needs during this pandemic. We review epidemiological literature on the mental health impact of pandemics, crisis counseling approaches developed from prior disasters, and clinical research on telepsychotherapy treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder. Based on this research, we provide a roadmap for ways that clinicians can use telepsychotherapy technologies for 2 levels of intervention: (1) providing strengths-based preventive interventions to help people cope with distress during a period of disruption, life-threat, and loss, and (2) delivering effective treatments to people who develop chronic conditions in response to traumatic stress.","Rosen, Craig S.; Glassman, Lisa H.; Morland, Leslie A.",J.

427174,Examining Inequities Associated With Changes in Obstetric and Gynecologic Care Delivery During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic,2020,"Severe emerging and re-emerging viral infections such as Lassa fever, Avian influenza (AI), and COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 urgently call for new strategies for the development of broad-spectrum antivirals targeting conserved components in the virus life cycle. Viral lipids are essential components, and viral-cell membrane fusion is the required entry step for most unrelated enveloped viruses. In this paper, we identified a porphyrin derivative of protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) that showed broad antiviral activities in vitro against a panel of enveloped pathogenic viruses including Lassa virus (LASV), Machupo virus (MACV), and SARS-CoV-2 as well as various subtypes of influenza A viral strains with IC50 values ranging from 0.91 ± 0.25 µM to 1.88 ± 0.34 µM. A mechanistic study using influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) as a testing strain showed that PPIX inhibits the infection in the early stage of virus entry through biophysically interacting with the hydrophobic lipids of enveloped virions, thereby inhibiting the entry of enveloped viruses into host cells. In addition, the preliminary antiviral activities of PPIX were further assessed by testing mice infected with the influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) virus. The results showed that compared with the control group without drug treatment, the survival rate and mean survival time of the mice treated with PPIX were apparently prolonged. These data encourage us to conduct further investigations using PPIX as a lead compound for the rational design of lipid-targeting antivirals for the treatment of infection with enveloped viruses.","Lu, Shengsheng; Pan, Xiaoyan; Chen, Daiwei; Xie, Xi; Wu, Yan; Shang, Weijuan; Jiang, Xiaming; Sun, Yuan; Fan, Sheng; He, Jian",Bioorg Chem,,16

428012,Mortality Rate and Predictors among Patients with COVID-19 Related Acute Respiratory Failure Requiring Mechanical Ventilation: A Retrospective Single Centre Study,2021,"BACKGROUND: Reduced use of the emergency department during the COVID-19 pandemic may result in increased disease acuity when patients do seek health care services. We sought to evaluate emergency department visits for common abdominal and gynecologic conditions before and at the beginning of the pandemic to determine whether changes in emergency department attendance had serious consequences for patients. METHODS: We conducted a population-based analysis using administrative data to evaluate the weekly rate of emergency department visits pre-COVID-19 (Jan. 1-Mar. 10, 2020) and during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic (Mar. 11-June 30, 2020), compared with a historical control period (Jan. 1-July 1, 2019). All residents of Ontario, Canada, presenting to the emergency department with appendicitis, cholecystitis, ectopic pregnancy or miscarriage were included. We evaluated weekly incidence rate ratios (IRRs) of emergency department visits, management strategies and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Across all study periods, 39 691 emergency department visits met inclusion criteria (40.2 % appendicitis, 32.1% miscarriage, 21.3% cholecystitis, 6.4% ectopic pregnancy). Baseline characteristics of patients presenting to the emergency department did not vary across study periods. After an initial reduction in emergency department visits, presentations for cholecystitis and ectopic pregnancy quickly returned to expected levels. However, presentations for appendicitis and miscarriage showed sustained reductions (IRR 0.61-0.80), with 1087 and 984 fewer visits, respectively, after the start of the pandemic, relative to 2019. Management strategies, complications and mortality rates were similar across study periods for all conditions. INTERPRETATION: Although our study showed evidence of emergency department avoidance in Ontario during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, no adverse consequences were evident. Emergency care and outcomes for patients were similar before and during the pandemic.","Gomez, David; Simpson, Andrea N; Sue-Chue-Lam, Colin; de Mestral, Charles; Dossa, Fahima; Nantais, Jordan; Wilton, Andrew S; Urbach, David; Austin, Peter C; Baxter, Nancy N",CMAJ,,16

438935,Efficacy of multidisciplinary team approach with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for COVID-19 in a low volume ECMO center,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease 2019, or COVID-19, in children is usually a mild disease, but severe illness has been reported. Currently, the therapy benefits of antiviral experimental drugs are still uncertain. The main aim of this study is to describe the experience of a level III hospital regarding therapeutic management of hospitalized children with COVID-19 and to characterize clinical features and evolution. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This is a descriptive study of patients with COVID-19 in a level III pediatric hospital in Portugal between March and June 2020. Experimental drugs were administered according to the best scientific evidence at the time as 'off-label use'. RESULTS: Among 200 children with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 37 were admitted due to COVID-19. Median age was one year (23 days - 18 years), 43% had comorbidities and 20/37 (54%) received antiviral therapy. Hydroxychloroquine was administered in 13 patients, in monotherapy or combined with lopinavir/ritonavir or azithromycin. Lopinavir/ritonavir was administered in eight patients and three children were treated with remdesivir. The patients who were treated had pneumonia (14), multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (2), sepsis (2), myocarditis (1), acute respiratory distress syndrome (1), and mild illness with comorbidities (3). Other therapies included methylprednisolone and immunoglobulin (3), enoxaparin (2), antibiotics (16), oxygen (7), corticosteroids, and other inhaled therapy (16). DISCUSSION: Several treatment approaches have been proposed for severe COVID-19, even though none of them had been proven effective or approved for small children. Currently, remdesivir is approved for children aged above 12 years-old. Although 54% of our patients were treated with antivirals, it is important to understand that the favorable clinical evolution could be related with the natural course of the disease. CONCLUSION: A significant proportion of our population presented severe and critical disease, was hospitalized and received treatment according to the most recent data, although most patients had mild disease. COVID-19 treatment in children is a clinical challenge and clinical trials are urgently needed.","Saraiva, Bárbara Martins; Garcia, Ana Margarida; Silva, Tiago Milheiro; Gouveia, Catarina; Brito, Maria João",Acta med. port,,16

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective single-center study on patients with COVID-19 from Jan. 18, 2020 to Feb. 7, 2020 in Zhuhai, China. Patients were divided into 3 types based on Chinese guideline: mild (patients with minimal symptoms and negative CT findings), common, and severe-critical (patients with positive CT findings and different extent of clinical manifestations). CT visual quantitative evaluation was based on summing up the acute lung inflammatory lesions involving each lobe, which was scored as 0 (0%), 1 (1-25%), 2 (26-50%), 3 (51-75%), or 4 (76-100%), respectively. The total severity score (TSS) was reached by summing the five lobe scores. The consistency of two observers was evaluated. The TSS was compared with the clinical classification. ROC was used to test the diagnosis ability of TSS for severe-critical type. RESULTS: This study included 78 patients, 38 males and 40 females. There were 24 mild (30.8%), 46 common (59.0%), and 8 severe-critical (10.2%) cases, respectively. The median TSS of severe-critical-type group was significantly higher than common type (p < 0.001). The ICC value of the two observers was 0.976 (95% CI 0.962-0.985). ROC analysis showed the area under the curve (AUC) of TSS for diagnosing severe-critical type was 0.918. The TSS cutoff of 7.5 had 82.6% sensitivity and 100% specificity. CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of clinical mild-type patients with COVID-19 was relatively high; CT was not suitable for independent screening tool.

443249,Commentary: Performing cardiac surgery in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) era: What is the new normal?,2020,"A crucial aspect of managing a public health crisis is to effectively balance prevention and mitigation strategies, while taking their socio-economic impact into account. In particular, determining the influence of different non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) on the effective use of public resources is an important problem, given the uncertainties on when a vaccine will be made available. In this paper, we propose a new approach for obtaining optimal policy recommendations based on epidemiological models, which can characterize the disease progression under different interventions, and a look-ahead reward optimization strategy to choose the suitable NPI at different stages of an epidemic. Given the time delay inherent in any epidemiological model and the exponential nature especially of an unmanaged epidemic, we find that such a look-ahead strategy infers non-trivial policies that adhere well to the constraints specified. Using two different epidemiological models, namely SEIR and EpiCast, we evaluate the proposed algorithm to determine the optimal NPI policy, under a constraint on the number of daily new cases and the primary reward being the absence of restrictions.","Thiagarajan, Jayaraman J.; Bremer, Peer-Timo; Anirudh, Rushil; Germann, Timothy C.; Valle, Sara Y.

Moreover, the addition of ECM-like proteins could enhance the biocompatibility of these scaffolds. In this study, soluble eggshell protein (SEP) was first extracted and synthesized from the raw eggshell membrane. The characteristics and biocompatibility of the extracted SEP were evaluated using attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) analysis and 3-(4,5- dimethylthiazol-2-yl-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) (MTT) assay. For scaffolds fabrication, a three-layer nanofibrous composite structure was produced using the electrospinning technique. The outer layers composed of polyvinyl alcohol, chitosan, and extracted SEP while the middle layer composed of polyethylene oxide, gelatin, and zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO-NPs). For each layer, the electrospinning parameters were adjusted to form bead-free fibers. To improve fibers' stability against body fluids, the produced fibers were crosslinked using glutaraldehyde vapor. Several techniques such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray, ATR-FTIR, swelling, tensile test, in vitro biodegradation, and MTT assay were implemented to evaluate the physical, chemical, and biological characterization of the fabricated fibers. The results showed that crosslinked fibers have adequate stability in water, suitable mechanical properties, and promising water uptake capacity. The MTT results also revealed that SEP and ZnO-NPs could increase scaffolds biocompatibility. Moreover, SEM photographs of cultured fibroblasts cells on the scaffolds showed that cells were well attached on the scaffolds and preserve their natural spindle shapes. Altogether, our findings demonstrated that the produced three-layer composite scaffolds are potential candidates for skin tissue engineering.","Amirsadeghi, Armin; Khorram, Mohammad; Hashemi, Seyeddeh-Sara",J. biomed. mater. res.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The meta-analysis was used to study the literatures on the psychology of pregnant women in four databases until Sep 27, 2020. RESULTS: A total of 19 articles were included in the final meta-analysis. The overall prevalence of anxiety was 42 % (95 %CI 26 %-57 %) with substantial heterogeneity (I2â¯=â¯99.6 %). The overall prevalence of depression was 25 % (95 %CI 20 %-31 %) with substantial heterogeneity (I2â¯=â¯97.9 %). Age, family economic status, social support, and physical activity seem to correlate with the mental health status of pregnant women. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of anxiety and depression among pregnant women increased significantly during the COVID-19 epidemic. Pregnant women are more concerned about others than themselves during COVID-19, and younger pregnant women seem to be more prone to anxiety, while social support and physical activity can reduce the likelihood of anxiety and depression. It is necessary to take some psychological intervention measures for pregnant women to help them go through this special period safely and smoothly.","Fan, Si; Guan, Jianping; Cao, Li; Wang, Manli; Zhao, Hua; Chen, Lili; Yan, Lei",Asian J Psychiatr,,16
462243,Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation for Pediatric Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019-Related Illness,2020,"BACKGROUND: For patients with COVID-19 who undergo emergency endotracheal intubation, data are limited regarding the practice, outcomes, and complications of this procedure. RESEARCH QUESTION: For patients with COVID-19 requiring emergency endotracheal intubation, how do the procedural techniques, the incidence of first-pass success, and the complications associated with the procedure compare with intubations of critically ill patients before the COVID-19 pandemic? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of adult patients with COVID-19 at Montefiore Medical Center who underwent first-time endotracheal intubation by critical care physicians between July 19, 2019, and May 1, 2020. The first COVID-19 patient was admitted to our institution on March 11, 2020; patients admitted before this date are designated the prepandemic cohort. Descriptive statistics were used to compare groups. A Fisher exact test was used to compare categorical variables. For continuous variables, a two-tailed Student t test was used for parametric variables or a Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used for nonparametric variables. RESULTS: One thousand two hundred sixty intubations met inclusion criteria (782 prepandemic cohort, 478 pandemic cohort). Patients during the pandemic were more likely to be intubated for hypoxemic respiratory failure (72.6% vs 28.1%; P < .01). During the pandemic, operators were more likely to use video laryngoscopy (89.4% vs 53.3%; P < .01) and neuromuscular blocking agents (86.0% vs 46.2%; P < .01). First-pass success was higher during the pandemic period (94.6% vs 82.9%; P < .01). The rate of associated complications was higher during the pandemic (29.5% vs 15.2%; P < .01), a finding driven by a higher rate of associated hypoxemia during or immediately after the procedure (25.7% vs 8.2%; P < .01). INTERPRETATION: Video laryngoscopy and neuromuscular blockade were used increasingly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite a higher rate of first-pass success during the pandemic, the incidence of complications associated with the procedure was higher.","Nauka, Peter C; Chen, Jen-Ting; Shiloh, Ariel L; Eisen, Lewis A; Fein, Daniel G",Chest,,16

Preclinical models of viral pneumonias that utilize ACE2 demonstrate Ang II type 1 receptor (AT1R) blockade mitigates lung injury, though observational COVID-19 data addressing the effect of AT1R blockade remain mixed. MethodsMulticenter, blinded, placebo-controlled randomized trial of losartan (50 mg PO twice daily for 10 days) versus placebo. Hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and a respiratory sequential organ failure assessment score of at least 1 and not already taking a renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitor were eligible. The primary outcome was the imputed partial pressure of oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) ratio at 7 days. Secondary outcomes included ordinal COVID-19 severity, oxygen, ventilator, and vasopressor-free days, and mortality. Losartan pharmacokinetics (PK) and RAAS components [Ang II, angiotensin-(1-7) (Ang-(1-7)), ACE, ACE2] were measured in a subgroup of participants. FindingsFrom April 2020 - February 2021, 205 participants were randomized, 101 to losartan and 104 to placebo. Compared to placebo, losartan did not significantly affect PaO2/FiO2 ratio at 7 days [difference of -24.8 (95% -55.6 to 6.1; p=0.12)]. Losartan did not improve any secondary clinical outcome, but worsened vasopressor-free days. PK data were consistent with appropriate steady-state concentrations, but we observed no significant effect of losartan on RAAS components. InterpretationInitiation of orally administered losartan to hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and acute lung injury does not improve PaO2 / FiO2 ratio at 7 days.

473851,Adding Inflammation to the Perfect Cytokine Storm: Concerns Related to Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation for COVID-19 Patients,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Surveillance of recent HIV infections in national testing services has the potential to inform primary prevention programming activities. Focusing on procedures required to accurately determine recent infection, and the potential for recent infection surveillance to inform prevention efforts, we present the results of three independent but linked pilots of recency testing. METHODS: To distinguish recently acquired HIV infection from long-standing infection, in 2018 we applied a Recent Infection Testing Algorithm that combined a laboratory-based Limiting Antigen Avidity Enzyme Immunoassay with clinical information (viral-load; history of prior HIV diagnosis; antiretroviral therapy-exposure). We explored potential misclassification of test results and analysed the characteristics of participants with recent infection. We applied the algorithm in antenatal clinics providing prevention of mother-to-child transmission services in Siaya County, Kenya, outreach sites serving female sex workers in Zimbabwe, and routine HIV testing and counselling facilities in Nairobi, Kenya. In Nairobi, we also conducted recency testing among partners of HIV-positive participants. RESULTS: In Siaya County, 2.3% (10/426) of HIV-positive pregnant women were classified as recent. A risk factor analysis comparing women testing recent with those testing HIV-negative found women in their first trimester were significantly more likely to test recent than those in their second or third trimester. In Zimbabwe, 10.5% (33/313) of female sex workers testing HIV-positive through the outreach programme were classified recent. A risk factor analysis of women testing recent versus those testing HIV-negative, found no strong evidence of an association with recent infection. In Nairobi, among 532 HIV-positive women and men, 8.6% (46) were classified recent. Among partners of participants, almost a quarter of those who tested HIV-positive were classified as recent (23.8%; 5/21). In all three settings, the inclusion of clinical information helped improve the positive predictive value of recent infection testing by removing cases that were likely misclassified. CONCLUSIONS: We successfully identified recently acquired infections among persons testing HIV-positive in routine testing settings and highlight the importance of incorporating additional information to accurately classify recent infection. We identified a number of groups with a significantly higher proportion of recent infection, suggesting recent infection surveillance, when rolled-out nationally, may help in further targeting primary prevention efforts.","Rice, Brian D; de Wit, Mariken; Welty, Susie; Risher, Kathryn; Cowan, Frances M; Murphy, Gary; Chabata, Sungai T; Waruiru, Wanjiru; Magutshwa, Sitholubuhle; Motoku, John; Kwaro, Daniel; Ochieng, Benard; Reniers, Georges; Rutherford, George",J Int AIDS Soc,,16

However, these parameters have not been observed consistently across studies. The aim of this review was to assess clinical laboratory parameters which may serve as markers or predictors of severe or critical COVID-19. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, CINAHL and Google Scholar databases from 2019 through April 18, 2020, and reviewed bibliographies of eligible studies, relevant systematic reviews, and the medRxiv pre-print server. We included hospital-based observational studies reporting clinical laboratory parameters of confirmed cases of COVID-19 and excluded studies having large proportions (>10%) of children and pregnant women. Two authors independently carried out screening of articles, data extraction and quality assessment. Meta-analyses were done using random effects model. Meta-median difference (MMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated for each laboratory parameter. Forty-five studies in 6 countries were included. Compared to non-severe COVID-19 cases, severe or critical COVID-19 was characterised by higher neutrophil count (MMD: 1.23 [95% CI: 0.58 to 1.88] ×109 cells/L), and lower lymphocyte, CD4 and CD8 T cell counts with MMD (95% CI) of -0.39 (-0.47, -0.31) ×109 cells/L, -204.9 (-302.6, -107.1) cells/µl and -123.6 (-170.6, -76.6) cells/µl, respectively. Other notable results were observed for C-reactive protein (MMD: 36.97 [95% CI: 27.58, 46.35] mg/L), interleukin-6 (MMD: 17.37 [95% CI: 4.74, 30.00] pg/ml), Troponin I (MMD: 0.01 [0.00, 0.02] ng/ml), and D-dimer (MMD: 0.65 [0.45, 0.85] mg/ml). CONCLUSIONS: Relative to non-severe COVID-19, severe or critical COVID-19 is characterised by increased markers of innate immune response, decreased markers of adaptive immune response, and increased markers of tissue damage and major organ failure. These markers could be used to recognise severe or critical disease and to monitor clinical course of COVID-19.","Moutchia, Jude; Pokharel, Pratik; Kerri, Aldiona; McGaw, Kaodi; Uchai, Shreeshti; Nji, Miriam; Goodman, Michael",PLoS One,,16

METHODS: We conducted a prospective multicenter survey of PED medical director(s) from selected children's hospitals recruited through a long established national research network. The questionnaire was developed by physicians with expertise in pediatric emergency medicine, disaster readiness, human factors, and survey development. Thirty-five children's hospitals were identified for recruitment through an established national research network. RESULTS: We report on survey responses from 25 (71%) of 35 PEDs, of which 64% were located within academic children's hospitals. All PEDs witnessed decreases in non-COVID-19 patients, 60% had COVID-19-dedicated units, and 32% changed their unit pediatric patient age to include adult patients. All PEDs implemented changes to their staffing model, with the most common change impacting their physician staffing (80%) and triaging model (76%). All PEDs conducted training for appropriate donning and doffing of personal protective equipment (PPE), and 62% reported shortages in PPE. The majority implemented changes in the airway management protocols (84%) and cardiac arrest management in COVID patients (76%). The most common training modalities were video/teleconference (84%) and simulation-based training (72%). The most common learning objectives were team dynamics (60%), and PPE and individual procedural skills (56%). CONCLUSIONS: This national survey provides insight into PED preparedness efforts, training innovations, and practice changes implemented during the start of COVID-19 pandemic. Pediatric emergency departments implemented broad strategies including modifications to staffing, workflow, and clinical practice while using video/teleconference and simulation as preferred training modalities. Further research is needed to advance the level of preparedness and support deep learning about which preparedness actions were effective for future pandemics.","Auerbach, Marc A; Abulebda, Kamal; Bona, Anna Mary; Falvo, Lauren; Hughes, Patrick G; Wagner, Michael; Barach, Paul R; Ahmed, Rami A",Pediatr Emerg Care,,16

This aggregation tends to miss out on fine details of the propagation patterns of the virus. This paper is motivated by analyzing a high-resolution COVID-19 dataset in Cali, Colombia, that provides every confirmed case's exact location and time information, offering vital insights for the spatio-temporal interaction between individuals concerning the disease spread in a metropolis. We develop a non-stationary spatio-temporal point process, assuming that previously infected cases trigger newly confirmed ones, and introduce a neural network-based kernel to capture the spatially varying triggering effect. The neural network-based kernel is carefully crafted to enhance expressiveness while maintaining results interpretability. We also incorporate some exogenous influences imposed by city landmarks. The numerical results on real data demonstrate good predictive performances of our method compared to the state-of-the-art as well as its interpretable findings.","Dong, Zheng; Zhu, Shixiang; Xie, Yao; Mateu, Jorge; Rodr'iguez-Cort'es, Francisco J.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.09029v2.pdf,16

505389,Sources of Revenue Loss and Recovery in Radiology Practices During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic,2021,"Airborne transmissions of infectious disease (e.g. SARS-CoV-2) in indoor environments may induce serious threat to public health. Air purification devices are necessary to remove and/or inactivate airborne biological species from indoor air environment. Corona discharge in an electrostatic precipitator is capable of removing particulate matter and disinfecting biological aerosols to act as electrostatic disinfector (ESD). The ions generated by ESD can effectively inactivate bacteria/viruses. However, the available research rarely investigated disinfection effect of ESD, and it is urgent to develop quantitative ESD design methods for building mechanical ventilation applications. This study developed an integrated numerical model to simulate disinfection performance of ESD. The numerical model considers the ionized electric field, electrohydrodynamic flow, and biological disinfection. The model prediction was validated with the experimental data (E. coli): Good agreement was observed. The validated model then was used to study the influences of essential design parameters (e.g. voltage, inlet velocity) of ESD on disinfection efficiency. The effects of modeling of electrophoretic force and EHD (electrohydrodynamic) flow patterns on disinfection efficiency and computing time were also analyzed. The disinfection efficiency of well-designed ESD (with space charge density of 3.6×10-06â¯C/m3) could be as high as 100%. Compared with HEPA, ESD could save 99% of energy consumed by HEPA without sacrificing disinfection efficiency.","Feng, Zhuangbo; Cao, Shi-Jie; Wang, Junqi; Kumar, Prashant; Haghighat, Fariborz",Build Environ,,16

The adverse prognostic impact of the combination of HF and CAD in these patients is unclear. METHODS AND RESULTS: we analysed data from 954 consecutive patients hospitalized for SARS-CoV-2 in five Italian Hospitals from February 23 to May 22, 2020. The study was a systematic prospective data collection according to a pre-specified protocol. All-cause mortality during hospitalization was the outcome measure. Mean duration of hospitalization was 33 days. Mortality was 11% in the total population and 7.4% in the group without evidence of HF or CAD (reference group). Mortality was 11.6% in the group with CAD and without HF (odds ratio [OR]: 1.6, p = 0.120), 15.5% in the group with HF and without CAD (OR: 2.3, p = 0.032), and 35.6% in the group with CAD and HF (OR: 6.9, p<0.0001). The risk of mortality in patients with CAD and HF combined was consistently higher than the sum of risks related to either disorder, resulting in a significant synergistic effect (p<0.0001) of the two conditions. Age-adjusted attributable proportion due to interaction was 64%. Adjusting for the simultaneous effects of age, hypotension, and lymphocyte count did not significantly lower attributable proportion which persisted statistically significant (p = 0.0360). CONCLUSION: The combination of HF and CAD exerts a marked detrimental impact on the risk of mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, which is independent on other adverse prognostic markers.","Angeli, Fabio; Marazzato, Jacopo; Verdecchia, Paolo; Balestrino, Antonella; Bruschi, Claudio; Ceriana, Piero; Chiovato, Luca; Vecchia, Laura Adelaide Dalla; De Ponti, Roberto; Fanfulla, Francesco; La Rovere, Maria Teresa; Perego, Francesca; Scalvini, Simonetta; Spanevello, Antonio; Traversi, Egidio; Visca, Dina; Vitacca, Michele; Bachetti, Tiziana",Eur. j. intern. med,,16
510841,Treatment for Severe Coronavirus Disease 2019 With the Seraph-100 Microbind Affinity Blood Filter,2020,"The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is primarily respiratory in nature, and as such, there is interest in examining whether air pollution might contribute to disease susceptibility or outcome. We merged data on COVID-19 cumulative prevalence and fatality rates as of May 31, 2020 with 2014-2019 pollution data from the US Environmental Protection Agency Environmental Justice Screen (EJSCREEN), with control for state testing rates, population density, and population covariate data from the County Health Rankings. Pollution data included three types of air emission concentrations (particulate matter<2.5 µm (PM2.5), ozone and diesel particulate matter (DPM)), and four pollution source variables (proximity to traffic, National Priority List sites, Risk Management Plan (RMP) sites, and hazardous waste treatment, storage and disposal facilities (TSDFs)). Results of mixed model linear multiple regression analyses indicated that, controlling for covariates, COVID-19 prevalence and fatality rates were significantly associated with greater DPM. Proximity to TSDFs was associated to greater fatality rates, and proximity to RMPs was associated with greater prevalence rates. Results are consistent with previous research indicating that air pollution increases susceptibility to respiratory viral pathogens. Results should be interpreted cautiously given the ecological design, the time lag between exposure and outcome, and the uncertainties in measuring COVID-19 prevalence. Areas with worse prior air quality, especially higher concentrations of diesel exhaust, may be at greater COVID-19 risk, although further studies are needed to confirm these relationships.","Hendryx, Michael; Luo, Juhua",Environ Pollut,,16

512999,Impact of early Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic on pediatric cardiac surgery in China,2020,"In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, several drugs have been repurposed as potential candidates for the treatment of COVID-19 infection. While preliminary choices were essentially based on in vitro potency, clinical translation into effective therapies may be challenging due to unfavorable in vivo pharmacokinetic properties at the doses chosen for this new indication of COVID-19 infection. However, available pharmacokinetic and pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic studies suffer from severe limitations leading to unreliable conclusions, especially in term of dosing optimization. In this paper we propose to highlight these limitations and to identify some of the major requirements that need to be addressed in designing PK and PK-PD studies in this era of COVID. A special attention should be paid to pre-analytical and analytical requirements and to the proper collection of covariates affecting dose-exposure relationships (co-medications, use of specific organ support techniques and other clinical and para-clinical data). We also promote the development of population PK and PK-PD models specifically dedicated to COVID-19 patients since those previously developed for other diseases (SEL, malaria, HIV) and clinical situations (steady-state, non-ICU patients) are not representative of severe patients. Therefore, implementation of well-designed PK and PD studies targeted to COVID-19 patients is urgently needed. For that purpose we call for multi-institutional collaborative work and involvement of clinical pharmacologists in multidisciplinary research consortia.","Venisse, Nicolas; Peytavin, Gilles; Bouchet, Stephane; Gagnieu, Marie-Claude; Garraffo, Rodolphe; Guilhaumou, Romain; Solas, Caroline",Antiviral Res,,16

Current guidance from the World Health Organization (WHO) highlights asthmatics as a high-risk group for severe illness from COVID-19. Viruses are common triggers of asthma exacerbations and the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic raises several questions regarding the optimum management strategies. Here, we discuss the contentious issue of whether the mainstay therapy systemic corticosteroids should be used in the routine management of COVID-19-associated asthma exacerbations. Recent guidance from the WHO has advised against the use of corticosteroids if COVID-19 is suspected due to concerns that these agents may impair protective innate antiviral immune responses. This may not be appropriate in the unique case of asthma exacerbation, a syndrome associated with augmented type 2 inflammation, a disease feature that is known to directly inhibit antiviral immunity. Corticosteroids, through their suppressive effects on type 2 inflammation, are thus likely to restore impaired antiviral immunity in asthma and, in contrast to non-asthmatic subjects, have beneficial clinical effects in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Kumar, Kartik; Hinks, Timothy S C; Singanayagam, Aran",,,16

METHODS AND RESULTS : From February to April 2020, we prospectively studied a cohort of 96 participants comprising 47 consecutive patients with CAD and acute SARS-CoV-2 infection (CAD + SARS-CoV-2), 19 CAD patients without infections, and 30 healthy controls. Clinical assessment included blood sampling, echocardiography, and electrocardiography within 12 h of admission. Respiratory failure was stratified by the Horovitz Index (HI) as moderately/severely impaired when HI &#8804;200 mmHg. The clinical endpoint (EP) was defined as HI &#8804;200 mmHg with subsequent mechanical ventilation within a follow-up of 30 days. The numbers of CD14dimCD16+ non-classical monocytes in peripheral blood were remarkably low in CAD + SARS-CoV-2 compared with CAD patients without infection and healthy controls (P < 0.0001). Moreover, these CD14dimCD16 monocytes showed decreased expression of established markers of adhesion, migration, and T-cell activation (CD54, CD62L, CX3CR1, CD80, and HLA-DR). Decreased numbers of CD14dimCD16+ monocytes were associated with the occurrence of EP. Kaplan-Meier curves illustrate that CAD + SARS-CoV-2 patients with numbers below the median of CD14dimCD16+ monocytes (median 1443 cells/mL) reached EP significantly more often compared to patients with numbers above the median (log-rank 5.03, P = 0.025). CONCLUSION : Decreased numbers of CD14dimCD16+ monocytes are associated with rapidly progressive respiratory failure in CAD + SARS-CoV-2 patients. Intensified risk assessments comprising monocyte sub- and phenotypes may help to identify patients at risk for respiratory failure.","Mueller, Karin Anne Lydia; Langnau, Carolin; Günter, Manina; Pöschel, Simone; Gekeler, Sarah; Petersen-Uribe, Álvaro; Kreisselmeier, Klaus-Peter; Klingel, Karin; Bösmüller, Hans; Li, Bo; Jaeger, Philippa; Castor, Tatsiana; Rath, Dominik; Gawaz, Meinrad Paul; Autenrieth, Stella E",Cardiovasc. res,,16

Up to the date of this publication, known global infections are now approaching 12 million, and deaths from the disease are approaching the 600,000 mark. While it was widely predicted by health experts that the pandemic would reach and exceed these proportions, what was not expected is that it would also unearth the fundamental flaws in governance that it has, not just in lesser developed states, but in some of the world’s most advanced democracies. The government’s response to the world over has been primarily to react to the demands of today’s politics in this new world where political fortunes are made and destroyed overnight, sometimes based on the mass reaction to a single badly worded tweet. Beyond this, political decisions to enact quarantine measures and other rules to manage the spread of the virus are complicated and costly, not just in monetary terms, but in terms of political capital, and in terms of the economic fallout that will last long beyond the pandemic itself.

Previously, we have identified two shRNA-expressing plasmids pEGFP-U6/P1 and pEGFP-U6/P2 that target RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) gene of TGEV with more than 95% of virus inhibition in vitro. In this study, inhibition of the TGEV replication by pEGFP-U6/P1 and pEGFP-U6/P2 was tested in mini-pigs. SPF mini-pigs at 25 days old were injected with the shRNA-expressing plasmids and then infected with TGEV. The results from the analyses of clinical signs, histopathology, indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) and RT-PCR show that the two shRNA-expressing plasmids could significantly decrease the quantity of TGEV in different organs and protect mini-pigs from TGEV infection. These findings illustrate the prospect for TGEV-specific shRNAs to be new anti-TGEV agents.","Zhou, Junfang; Huang, Fen; Hua, Xiuguo; Cui, Li; Zhang, Wen; Shen, Yan; Yan, Yijia; Chen, Piren; Ding, Dezhong; Mou, Jing; Chen, Qi; Lan, Daoliang; Yang, Zhibiao",Virus Res,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170210000092; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170210000092; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2009.12.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20080134/,16

Whether they are SARS-CoV-2 intermediate hosts is worthy of great attention. The interaction of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and its acceptor protein ACE2 is an important issue in determining viral host range and cross-species infection, while the binding capacity of Spike protein to ACE2 of different species is unknown. Here, we used the atomic structure model of SARS-CoV-2 and human ACE2 to assess the receptor utilization capacity of ACE2s from 10 kinds of animals. Results show that chimpanzees, domestic cats and cattles are more susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV-2. Cats in particular, such as pet cats and stray cats, interact very closely with humans, implying the necessity to carefully evaluate the risk of cats during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, based on ACE2(cats)-SARS-CoV-2-RBD model, through high-throughput screening methods using a pool of 30,000 small molecules, eight compounds were selected for binding free energy calculations. All the eight compounds can effectively interfere with the binding of ACE2 and Spike protein, especially Nelfinavir, providing drug candidates for the treatment and prevention of SARS-CoV-2, suggesting further assessment of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of these compounds in cell culture. Although we only reported the results of the simulation, and more laboratory and epidemiological investigation are required. Like cats are a risk factor, we can further detect SARS-CoV-2 according to the susceptibility of different animals, find the potential host of infection, and completely cut off the living space of the virus. Especially, cats could be a choice of animal model for screening antiviral drugs or vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV-2.","Shen, Min; Liu, Chao; Xu, Run; Ruan, Zijing; Zhao, Shiying; Zhang, Huidong; Wang, Wen; Huang, Xinhe; Yang, Li; Tang, Yong; Yang, Tai; Jia, Xu",Front Genet,https://doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2020.575012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33193684/,16

Recombinant proteins represent the most reliable and safe vaccine approach but generally require a suitable adjuvant for robust and durable immunity. We used the SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequence and in silico structural modelling to design a recombinant spike protein vaccine (Covax-19™). A synthetic gene encoding the spike extracellular domain (ECD) was inserted into a baculovirus backbone to express the protein in insect cell cultures. The spike ECD was formulated with Advax-SM adjuvant and first tested for immunogenicity in C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice. Covax-19 vaccine induced high spike protein binding antibody levels that neutralised the original lineage B.1.319 virus from which the vaccine spike protein was derived, as well as the variant B.1.1.7 lineage virus. Covax-19 vaccine also induced a high frequency of spike-specific CD4+ and CD8+ memory T-cells with a dominant Th1 phenotype associated with the ability to kill spike-labelled target cells in vivo. Ferrets immunised with Covax-19 vaccine intramuscularly twice 2 weeks apart made spike receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG and were protected against an intranasal challenge with SARS-CoV-2 virus given two weeks after the last immunisation. Notably, ferrets that received the two higher doses of Covax-19 vaccine had no detectable virus in their lungs or in nasal washes at day 3 post-challenge, suggesting that in addition to lung protection, Covax-19 vaccine may have the potential to reduce virus transmission. This data supports advancement of Covax-19 vaccine into human clinical trials.","Li, Lei; Honda-Okubo, Yoshikazu; Huang, Ying; Jang, Hyesun; Carlock, Michael A.; Baldwin, Jeremy; Piplani, Sakshi; Bebin-Blackwell, Anne G.; Forgacs, David; Sakamoto, Kaori; Stella, Alberto; Turville, Stuart; Chataway, Tim; Colella, Alex; Triccas, Jamie; Ross, Ted M; Petrovsky, Nikolai",Vaccine,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X21009920?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34420786/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X21009920; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.07.087,16

METHODS: Online cross-sectional survey of 30,375 adults in the UK from 21st March to 4th April 2020 (sample weighted). Logistic regression models were used to examine sociodemographic, drinking and COVID-19 factors associated with i) drinking less and ii) drinking more (versus same as usual). RESULTS: Of 22,113 drinkers, 48.1 % reported drinking about the same, 25.7 % reported drinking less, and 26.2 % reported drinking more than usual over the past week. Drinking less was independently associated with being younger (OR = 0.88, p < .001), male (OR = 0.76, p < .001), BAME (OR = 0.76, p = .028), low income (OR = 0.74, p < .001), having COVID-19 (OR = 2.04, p < .001), adhering to COVID-19 protective behaviours (OR = 1.58, p = .020), stress about becoming ill from COVID-19 (OR = 1.26, p = .004) and not being a key worker (OR = 0.87, p = .030). Drinking more was independently associated with being younger (OR = 0.73, p < .001), female (OR = 1.36, p < .001), post-16 qualifications (OR = 1.21, p = .012), high income (OR = 1.43, p < .001), stress about catching (OR = 1.22, p = .020) or becoming ill from COVID-19 (OR = 1.28, p < .001), stress about finances (OR = 1.43, p < .001), and having an anxiety disorder (OR = 1.24, p = .011). CONCLUSIONS: In a large, population sample of adults in the UK, around a quarter of drinkers reported drinking more alcohol and a quarter drinking less than usual during the COVID-19 related lockdown. Certain groups, such as those who are younger, female, of high socioeconomic position, have an anxiety disorder, and are stressed about finances or COVID-19 may need targeted alcohol reduction support during lockdown.","Garnett, Claire; Jackson, Sarah; Oldham, Melissa; Brown, Jamie; Steptoe, Andrew; Fancourt, Daisy",Drug Alcohol Depend,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0376871620306268; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0376871620306268; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33454159/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2020.108461,16

Circulating levels of the coagulation cascade activator PAI-1 are substantially higher in patients with COVID-19 with severe respiratory dysfunction than in patients with bacterial sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Indeed, the elevation of PAI-1 is recognized as an early marker of endothelial dysfunction. Here, we report that the rSARS-CoV-2-S1 (recombinant severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2] viral envelope spike) glycoprotein stimulated robust production of PAI-1 by human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMECs). We examined the role of protein degradation in this SARS-CoV-2-S1 induction of PAI-1 and found that the proteasomal degradation inhibitor bortezomib inhibited SARS-CoV-2-S1–mediated changes in PAI-1. Our data further show that bortezomib upregulated KLF2, a shear-stress–regulated transcription factor that suppresses PAI-1 expression. Aging and metabolic disorders are known to increase mortality and morbidity in patients with COVID-19. We therefore examined the role of ZMPSTE24 (zinc metallopeptidase STE24), a metalloprotease with a demonstrated role in host defense against RNA viruses that is decreased in older individuals and in metabolic syndrome, in the induction of PAI-1 in HPMECs by SARS-CoV-2-S1. Indeed, overexpression of ZMPSTE24 blunted enhancement of PAI-1 production in spike protein–exposed HPMECs. In addition, we found that membrane expression of the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor ACE2 was reduced by ZMPSTE24-mediated cleavage and shedding of the ACE2 ectodomain, leading to accumulation of ACE2 decoy fragments that may bind SARS-CoV-2. These data indicate that decreases in ZMPSTE24 with age and comorbidities may increase vulnerability to vascular endothelial injury by SARS-CoV-2 viruses and that enhanced production of endothelial PAI-1 might play role in prothrombotic events in patients with COVID-19.","Han, Mingming; Pandey, Deepesh",American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34003736/; https://doi.org/10.1165/rcmb.2020-0544oc,16

In this paper, we study a diseased prey–predator model with general Holling type interactions. Local stability conditions of equilibrium points are derived. We obtain the permanence and impermanence conditions of the system. The conditions for global stability of the system are also derived. The system exhibits limit cycle, period-2, higher periodic oscillations and chaotic behaviour for different values of Holling parameters. One parameter bifurcation analysis is done with respect to general Holling parameters and infection rate. We utilize the MATCONT package to analyse the detailed bifurcation scenario as the two important interaction parameters are varied.

METHODS: The PubMed database and Web of Science were searched in November 2020 according to the PRISMA statement. Studies were deemed eligible if they reported the survival and pathologic outcomes of patients treated with deferred RP for intermediate- and high-risk PCa compared to the control group including those patients treated with RP without delay. RESULTS: Overall, nineteen studies met our eligibility criteria. We found a significant heterogeneity across the studies in terms of definitions for delay and outcomes, as well as in patients’ baseline clinicopathologic features. According to the currently available literature, deferred RP does not seem to affect oncological survival outcomes, such as prostate cancer-specific mortality and metastasis-free survival, in patients with intermediate- or high-risk PCa. However, the impact of deferred RP on biochemical recurrence rates remains controversial. There is no clear association of deferring RP with any of the features of aggressive disease such as pathologic upgrading, upstaging, positive surgical margins, extracapsular extension, seminal vesicle invasion, and lymph node invasion. Deferred RP was not associated with the need for secondary treatments. CONCLUSIONS: Owing to the different definitions of a delayed RP, it is hard to make a consensus regarding the safe delay time. However, the current data suggest that deferring RP in patients with intermediate- and high-risk PCa for at least around 3 months is generally safe, as it does not lead to adverse pathologic outcomes, biochemical recurrence, the need for secondary therapy, or worse oncological survival outcomes.","Laukhtina, Ekaterina; Sari Motlagh, Reza; Mori, Keiichiro; Quhal, Fahad; Schuettfort, Victor M.; Mostafaei, Hadi; Katayama, Satoshi; Grossmann, Nico C.; Ploussard, Guillaume; Karakiewicz, Pierre I.; Briganti, Alberto; Abufaraj, Mohammad; Enikeev, Dmitry; Pradere, Benjamin; Shariat, Shahrokh F.",World J Urol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34047825/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00345-021-03703-8,16

Racial and ethnic disparities in health care have been well documented in COVID-19 with respect to risk of infection and in-hospital outcomes once admitted, and here we assess disparities in those who access healthcare via telemedicine for COVID-19 . MATERIALS AND METHODS: Electronic health record data of patients at New York University Langone Health between March 19th and April 30, 2020 were used to conduct descriptive and multilevel regression analyses with respect to visit type (telemedicine or in-person), suspected COVID diagnosis and COVID test results. RESULTS: Controlling for individual and community-level attributes, Black patients had 0.6 times the adjusted odds (95%CI:0.58-0.63) of accessing care through telemedicine compared to white patients, though they are increasingly accessing telemedicine for urgent care, driven by a younger and female population. COVID diagnoses were significantly more likely for Black versus white telemedicine patients. DISCUSSION: There are disparities for Black patients accessing telemedicine, however increased uptake by young, female Black patients. Mean income and decreased mean household size of Zip code were also significantly related to telemedicine use. CONCLUSION: Telemedicine access disparities reflect those in in-person healthcare access. Roots of disparate use are complex and reflect individual, community, and structural factors, including their intersection; many of which are due to systemic racism. Evidence regarding disparities that manifest through telemedicine can be used to inform tool design and systemic efforts to promote digital health equity.","Chunara, Rumi; Zhao, Yuan; Chen, Ji; Lawrence, Katharine; Testa, Paul A; Nov, Oded; Mann, Devin M",J Am Med Inform Assoc,https://doi.org/10.1093/jamia/ocaa217; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32866264/,16

At the national and regional levels, the global behavior of the occurrence was determined, and later at the communal level, the political territorial unit, to determine internal variations attributable to the mobility dynamics in the quarantine period. In the process, the meteorological background of the fire activity was also considered. The results indicate that it is possible to rule out a meteorological effect, based on the variation of the moisture content of fine fuel. There was also no statistical association between the humidity of the fuel and the variation in the occurrence of fires. It is concluded that the communes that presented the greatest mobility of people before the pandemic were those that obtained the greatest reduction in fires. The variation in mobility, the product of restriction measures, is a statistical predictor of the increase or decrease in fires.","Castillo, Miguel; Saavedra, Jorge; Quiñones, Tomás; Osses, Tatiana; José Torres, María",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34639829/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph181910529,16
642206,Management of Upper Airway Bleeding in COVID‐19 Patients on Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation,2020-05-29,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, associated with the economic consequences of non-pharmaceutical interventions such as lockdown, has led to mental health consequences among people worldwide. Protecting the mental well-being of populations is an imperative component of fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. This scoping review attempts to present an overview of the existing tools to measure COVID-19-related mental health problems. METHODS: Literature search was conducted in the PubMed electronic database using developed key search terms. Reference lists of the identified eligible articles were reviewed to locate relevant articles missed from the electronic database search. Fifteen scales measuring COVID-19-associated mental health problems, validated among diverse populations across the world, were included in this review. RESULTS: The majority of these scales were validated among middle-aged adults in Turkey. Only a few validated scales encompass the negative socioeconomic consequences of COVID-19. None of the available scales focused on the aspects of suicidal ideation or behavioral responses/coping strategies, neither were they inclusive of participants from diverse age, geographic, and COVID-19 exposure groups. CONCLUSION: This scoping review highlights the need for future research to develop and validate comprehensive psychometric tools to assess COVID-19-associated mental health problems. Also, in view of the vulnerable nature of healthcare professionals for developing mental health concerns in the course of providing services for COVID-19-affected individuals, future psychometric research needs to concentrate on the development of measures specific for these professionals.","Chandu, Viswa Chaitanya; Marella, Yamuna; Panga, Gnana Sarita; Pachava, Srinivas; Vadapalli, Viswanath",Indian J Psychol Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33414588/; https://doi.org/10.1177/0253717620946439,16
644603,Commentary: Safe Harbor During Pandemic Storm,2020-07-24,"OBJECTIVE We investigated the incidence, predictor variables, clinical characteristics, and stroke outcomes in patients with COVID-19 seen in emergency departments (EDs) before hospitalization. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed all COVID-19 patients diagnosed with stroke during the COVID-19 outbreak in 62 Spanish EDs. We formed two control groups: COVID-19 patients without stroke (control A) and non-COVID-19 patients with stroke (Control B). We compared disease characteristics and 4 outcomes between cases and controls. RESULTS We identified 147 strokes in 74,814 patients with COVID-19 seen in EDs (1.96‰, 95%CI=1.66-2.31‰), being lower than in non-COVID-19 patients (6,541/1,388,879, 4.71‰, 95%CI=4.60-4.83‰; OR=0.42, 95%CI=0.35-0.49). The estimated standardized incidences of stroke per 100,000 individuals per year were 124 and 133 for COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 individuals, respectively (OR=0.93 for COVID patients, 95%CI=0.87-0.99). Baseline characteristics associated with a higher risk of stroke in COVID-19 patients were hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and previous cerebrovascular and coronary diseases. Clinically, these patients more frequently presented confusion, decreased consciousness and syncope and higher D-dimer concentrations and leukocyte count at ED arrival. After adjustment for age and sex, the case group had higher hospitalization and ICU admission rates (but not mortality) than COVID-19 controls without stroke (OR=3.41, 95%CI=1.27-9.16; and OR=3.79, 95%CI=1.69-8.50; respectively), and longer hospitalization and greater in-hospital mortality than stroke controls without COVID-19 (OR=1.55, 95%CI=1.24-1.94; and OR=1.77, 95%CI=1.37-2.30; respectively). CONCLUSIONS The incidence of stroke in COVID-19 patients presenting to EDs was lower than in the non-COVID-19 reference sample. COVID-19 patients with stroke had greater need for hospitalization and ICU admission than those without stroke, and longer hospitalization and greater in-hospital mortality than non-COVID-19 patients with stroke.","Jorge García-Lamberechts, Eric; Miró, Òscar; Fragiel, Marcos; Llorens, Pere; Jiménez, Sònia; Piñera, Pascual; Burillo, Guillermo; Martín, Alfonso; Martín-Sánchez, Francisco Javier; Jacob, Javier; Alquézar-Arbé, Aitor; Ejarque Martínez, Laura; Rodríguez Miranda, Belén; Ruiz Grinspan, Martín; Domínguez, María Jesús; Teigell Muñoz, Francisco Javier; Gayoso Martín, Sara; García García, Angel; Iglesias Vela, Marta; Carbajosa, Virginia; Salido, Manuel; Marchena González, María José; Agüera Urbano, Carmen; Porta-Etessam, Jesus; Calvo, Elpidio; Del Castillo, Juan González",Academic emergency medicine : official journal of the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34490961/; https://doi.org/10.1111/acem.14389,16
645927,The New Normal: Key Considerations for Effective Serious Illness Communication Over Video or Telephone During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic,2020-05-14,"BACKGROUND: The letter of recommendation is currently an integral part of applicant selection for residency programs. Internal medicine residents will spend much time and expense completing sub-specialty away electives to obtain a letter of recommendation. The purpose of this study was 1) to examine a large sample of reference letters in order to define essential components of a high-quality letter, and 2) to elucidate the relationship between quality of reference letter and the letter writer. METHODS: We conducted a two-phase study. In phase one, a large sample of letters of recommendation was examined using an audit tool as a coding framework. A 5-point composite endpoint of high-quality letter components was subsequently developed. In phase two, program director letters were compared to non-program director home institution and non-home institution elective letters based on inclusion of components of the 5-point composite endpoint using Chi square testing. RESULTS: 715 letters were examined (398 non-program director home institution letters, 201 program director letters, and 116 non-home institution elective letters). High-quality letter components were: nature of relationship, duration of relationship, In Training Evaluation Report information, research involvement and comments on areas for improvement. Program director letters had a significantly higher proportion (10.4%) of all 5 high-quality components, compared to 0% in both non-program director home institution letters and elective letters (p < 0.001). A significantly higher proportion of program director letters had 4–5 high-quality components (62.5%) compared to 2% of non-program director home institution letters and 0% of elective letters (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Letters of recommendation from elective rotations are of the poorest quality and such rotations should not be pursued for the sole purpose of obtaining a letter. The low quality of elective letters leads to the recommendation that writers should decline to write them, programs should not require them and trainees should not request them. Program directors write the highest quality letters and should be a resource for faculty development. Clinical supervisors can use the 5-point composite endpoint as a guide when writing letters for applicants.","Chopra, Deepti; Joneja, Mala; Sandhu, Gurjit; Smith, Christopher A.; Spagnuolo, Catherine M.; Hookey, Lawrence",BMC Med Educ,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12909-020-02270-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33028313/,16

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether there is a relation between the serostatus of 13 different viruses and parentally reported infections and IgE sensitization in 2-year-old children. To investigate whether there is an interaction between cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in relation to IgE sensitization. METHODS: A total of 246 infants were followed prospectively to 2 years of age with clinical examinations, skin prick test, and specific IgE analyses and through analysis of seropositivity against adenovirus, influenza, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus, CMV, EBV, herpes simplex virus, human herpesvirus 6, and varicella-zoster virus. RESULTS: There was some evidence that IgE sensitization (24%) tended to be more common among children who were seropositive against few compared with children who were seropositive against many viruses, but this was not statistically significant, and there was no consistent trend across the groups. IgE sensitization was statistically significantly less prevalent at 2 years of age among infants who were seropositive against EBV but not other viruses (adjusted odds ratio, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.14-0.86). The interaction of seropositivity against both CMV and EBV antibodies indicated a further reduction in the risk for IgE sensitization (adjusted odds ratio for interaction, 0.10; 95% CI, 0.01-0.92), indicating effect modification associated with seropositivity against CMV. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that acquisition of EBV infection during the first 2 years of life is associated with a reduced risk of IgE sensitization, and this effect is enhanced by CMV coinfection.","Nilsson, Caroline; Linde, Annika; Montgomery, Scott M.; Gustafsson, Liselotte; Näsman, Per; Blomberg, Marita Troye; Lilja, Gunnar",J Allergy Clin Immunol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0091674905007700; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16083803/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091674905007700,16

Preliminary survey results show the need for point-of-care testing (POCT) devices using test clusters that specifically detect pathogens found in disaster scenarios. Hurricane Katrina, the tsunami in southeast Asia, and the current influenza pandemic (H1N1, “swine flu”) vividly illustrate lack of national and global preparedness. Gap analysis of current POCT devices versus survey results reveals how POCT needs can be fulfilled. Future thinking will help avoid the worst consequences of disasters on the horizon, such as extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis and pandemic influenzas. A global effort must be made to improve POC technologies to rapidly diagnose and treat patients to improve triaging, on-site decision making, and, ultimately, economic and medical outcomes.","Kost, Gerald J.; Hale, Kristin N.; Brock, T.

652390,Rhythm blues in the time of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): how the cardiac electrophysiologist adapts to a viral pandemic in Singapore,2020-05-27,"BACKGROUND: In the United States, laboratory confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is nationally notifiable. However, reported case counts are recognized to be less than the true number of cases because detection and reporting are incomplete and can vary by disease severity, geography, and over time. METHODS: To estimate the cumulative incidence SARS-CoV-2 infections, symptomatic illnesses, and hospitalizations, we adapted a simple probabilistic multiplier model. Laboratory-confirmed case counts that were reported nationally were adjusted for sources of under-detection based on testing practices in inpatient and outpatient settings and assay sensitivity. RESULTS: We estimated that through the end of September, 1 of every 2.5 (95% Uncertainty Interval (UI): 2.0–3.1) hospitalized infections and 1 of every 7.1 (95% UI: 5.8–9.0) non-hospitalized illnesses may have been nationally reported. Applying these multipliers to reported SARS-CoV-2 cases along with data on the prevalence of asymptomatic infection from published systematic reviews, we estimate that 2.4 million hospitalizations, 44.8 million symptomatic illnesses, and 52.9 million total infections may have occurred in the U.S. population from February 27–September 30, 2020. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary estimates help demonstrate the societal and healthcare burdens of the COVID-19 pandemic and can help inform resource allocation and mitigation planning.","Reese, Heather; Iuliano, A Danielle; Patel, Neha N; Garg, Shikha; Kim, Lindsay; Silk, Benjamin J; Hall, Aron J; Fry, Alicia; Reed, Carrie",Clin Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa1780; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33237993/,16
658318,Inspiratory Effort and Lung Mechanics in Spontaneously Breathing Patients with Acute Respiratory Failure Due to COVID-19: A Matched Control Study,2021,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid‐19) is a viral infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) that clinically affects multiple organs of the human body. Cells in the oral cavity express viral entry receptor angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 that allows viral replication and may cause tissue inflammation and destruction. Recent studies have reported that Covid‐19 patients present oral manifestations with multiple clinical aspects. In this review, we aim to summarise main signs and symptoms of Covid‐19 in the oral cavity, its possible association with oral diseases, and the plausible underlying mechanisms of hyperinflammation reflecting crosstalk between Covid‐19 and oral diseases. Ulcers, blisters, necrotising gingivitis, opportunistic coinfections, salivary gland alterations, white and erythematous plaques and gustatory dysfunction were the most reported clinical oral manifestations in patients with Covid‐19. In general, the lesions appear concomitant with the loss of smell and taste. Multiple reports show evidences of necrotic/ulcerative gingiva, oral blisters and hypergrowth of opportunistic oral pathogens. SARS‐CoV‐2 exhibits tropism for endothelial cells and Covid‐19‐mediated endotheliitis can not only promote inflammation in oral tissues but can also facilitate virus spread. In addition, elevated levels of proinflammatory mediators in patients with Covid‐19 and oral infectious disease can impair tissue homeostasis and cause delayed disease resolution. This suggests potential crosstalk of immune‐mediated pathways underlying pathogenesis. Interestingly, few reports suggest recurrent herpetic lesions and higher bacterial growth in Covid‐19 subjects, indicating SARS‐CoV‐2 and oral virus/bacteria interaction. Larger cohort studies comparing SARS‐CoV‐2 negative and positive subjects will reveal oral manifestation of the virus on oral health and its role in exacerbating oral infection.","Brandini, Daniela A.; Takamiya, Aline S.; Thakkar, Pari; Schaller, Samantha; Rahat, Rani; Naqvi, Afsar R.",Rev Med Virol,https://doi.org/10.1002/rmv.2226; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33646645/,16

In this context, the entire health care workforce must be properly trained to guarantee an effective response. Just-in-time training has been an efficient solution for rapidly equipping health care workers with new knowledge, skills, and attitudes during emergencies; thus, it could also be an effective training technique in the context of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Because of the unexpected magnitude of this health crisis, the health care workforce must be trained in 2 areas: (1) basic infection prevention and control, including public health skills that are the core of population-based health management and (2) disaster medicine principles, such as surge capacity, allocation of scarce resources, triage, and the ethical dilemmas of rationing medical care. This Perspective reports how just-in-time training concepts and methods were applied in a tertiary referral hospital in March 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic in Northern Italy, one of the hardest hit places in the world. The COVID-19 just-in-time training was designed to provide hospital staff with the competencies they need to work proficiently and safely inside the hospital, including an understanding of the working principles and standard operating procedures in place and the correct use of personal protective equipment. Moreover, this training was intended to address the basic principles of disaster medicine applied to the COVID-19 pandemic. Such training was essential in enabling staff to rapidly attain competencies that most of them lacked because disaster medicine and global health are not included in the curricula of Italian medical and nursing schools. Although a formal evaluation was not performed, this is a useful example of how to create just-in-time training in a large hospital during a crisis of an unprecedented scale.","Ragazzoni, Luca; Barco, Ambra; Echeverri, Lina; Conti, Andrea; Linty, Monica; Caviglia, Marta; Merlo, Federico; Martini, Daniela; Pirisi, Alessandro; Weinstein, Eric; Barone-Adesi, Francesco; Della Corte, Francesco",Acad Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32639262/; https://doi.org/10.1097/acm.0000000000003575,16

Here, we assess the impact of an increased circulation of other respiratory viruses on the monitoring of positivity rates of SARS-CoV-2 and interpretation of surveillance data. Methods: Using a multi-pathogen Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) transmission model formalizing co-circulation of SARS-CoV-2 and another respiratory we assess how an outbreak of secondary virus may inflate the number of SARS-CoV-2 tests and affect the interpretation of COVID-19 surveillance data. Using simulation, we assess to what extent the use of multiplex PCR tests on a subsample of symptomatic individuals can support correction of the observed SARS-CoV-2 percent positive during other virus outbreaks and improve surveillance quality. Results: Model simulations demonstrated that a non-SARS-CoV-2 epidemic creates an artificial decrease in the observed percent positivity of SARS-CoV-2, with stronger effect during the growth phase, until the peak is reached. We estimate that performing one multiplex test for every 1,000 COVID-19 tests on symptomatic individuals could be sufficient to maintain surveillance of other respiratory viruses in the population and correct the observed SARS-CoV-2 percent positive. Conclusions: This study highlights that co-circulating respiratory viruses can disrupt SARS-CoV-2 surveillance. Correction of the positivity rate can be achieved by using multiplex PCR, and a low number of samples is sufficient to avoid bias in SARS-CoV-2 surveillance.","Kovacevic, A.; Eggo, R.

The strong support from governing authorities such as Operation Warp Speed and robust funding has led to the development and authorization of the tozinameran (BNT162b2) vaccine. The BNT162b2 vaccine is a lipid nanoparticle-encapsulated mRNA that encodes for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, the main site for neutralizing antibodies. Once it binds with the host cells, the lipid nanoparticles enable the transfer of the RNA, causing S antigens’ expression of the SARS-CoV-2, conferring immunity. The vaccine is administered as a 2-dose regime 21 days apart for individuals 16 years and older. Pfizer-BioNTech’s BNT162b2 vaccine was the first candidate to receive FDA-Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) on December 11, 2020. During phase 2/3 clinical trials, 95% efficacy was reported among 37,706 participants over the age of 16 who received the BNT162b2 vaccination; additionally, 52% efficacy was noted 12 days following the administration of the first dose of BNT162b2, reflecting early protection of COVID-19. The BNT162b2 vaccine has exhibited 100% efficacy in clinical trials of adolescents between the ages of 12 and 15. Clinical trials in pregnant women and children under the age of 12 are expected to also exhibit promising results.

Here we conducted two separate human studies and show that bone mineral density was significantly lower in smokers than in non-smokers. The first was an observational study of pre- and post-menopausal healthy female smokers and non-smokers; the second included 139 current smokers determined to stop smoking. In the second study, levels of bone formation markers such as osteocalcin and uncarboxylated osteocalcin significantly increased after successful smoking cessation, as verified by significantly reduced levels of serum cotinine, a nicotine metabolite. Moreover, nicotine administration to mice reduced bone mineral density and significantly increased the number of osteoclasts in bone. Reduced bone mass phenotypes seen in nicotine-treated mice were significantly increased following nicotine withdrawal, an outcome accompanied by significantly reduced serum levels of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase, a bone resorption marker. Taken together, our findings suggest that bone homeostasis is perturbed but can be rescued by smoking cessation.","Kiyota, Yasuhiro; Muramatsu, Hiroyasu; Sato, Yuiko; Kobayashi, Tami; Miyamoto, Kana; Iwamoto, Takuji; Matsumoto, Morio; Nakamura, Masaya; Tateno, Hiroki; Sato, Kazuki; Miyamoto, Takeshi",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-73789-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33033284/,16

We evaluated the efficacy of clinically relevant hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3 protease inhibitors (PI) against SARS-CoV-2 and their interactions with remdesivir, the only antiviral approved for treatment of COVID-19. HCV PI showed differential potency in VeroE6 cell-based antiviral assays based on detection of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. Linear PI boceprevir, telaprevir and narlaprevir had 50% effective concentrations (EC50) of ~40 μM. Among macrocyclic PI simeprevir, paritaprevir, grazoprevir, glecaprevir, voxilaprevir, vaniprevir, danoprevir and deldeprevir, simeprevir had the highest (EC50 15 μM) and glecaprevir the lowest (EC50 >178 μM) potency. Acyclic PI asunaprevir and faldaprevir had EC50 of 72 and 23 μM, respectively. ACH-806, an HCV NS3 protease co-factor NS4A inhibitor, had EC50 of 46 μM. For selected PI, potency was similar in human hepatoma Huh7.5 cells. Selectivity indexes, based on antiviral and cell viability assays, were highest for linear PI. In combination with remdesivir, linear PI boceprevir and narlaprevir showed antagonism, while macrocyclic PI simeprevir, paritaprevir and grazoprevir showed synergism with drug reduction indexes of up to 27 for simeprevir. Treatment of infected cultures with equipotent concentrations (1-fold EC50) of HCV PI revealed minor differences in barrier to SARS-CoV-2 escape. Complete viral suppression was achieved treating with ≥3-fold EC50 boceprevir or combination of 1-fold EC50 simeprevir with 0.4-fold EC50 remdesivir, not leading to significant viral suppression in single treatments. Considering potency, human plasma concentrations and synergism with remdesivir, simeprevir seemed the most promising compound for optimization of future antiviral treatments of COVID-19.","Gammeltoft, Karen A.; Zhou, Yuyong; Galli, Andrea; Offersgaard, Anna; Pham, Long V.; Fahnøe, Ulrik; Feng, Shan; Ramirez, Santseharay; Bukh, Jens; Gottwein, Judith M.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.02.408112,16

In this note, we present a modified SEIR model which takes into account the time lag effect and probability distribution of model states. Based on the proposed model, it is estimated that the actual total number of infected people by 1 April in the UK might have already exceeded 610,000. Average fatality rates under different assumptions at the beginning of April 2020 are also estimated. Our model also reveals that the R0 value is between 7.5-9 which is much larger than most of the previously reported values. The proposed model has a potential to be used for assessing future epidemic situations under different intervention strategies.","SUN, Peiliang; Li, Kang",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.12.20062588,16
680309,Donor quality assessment and size match in lung transplantation,2021-09-15,"Tuberculosis is the leading infectious disease killer globally due to a single pathogen. Despite wide deployment of standard drug regimens, modern diagnostics and a vaccine (bacille Calmette Guerin, BCG), the global tuberculosis epidemic is inadequately controlled. Novel, effective vaccine(s) are a crucial element of the World Health Organization End TB Strategy. TB vaccine research and development has recently been catalysed by several factors, including a revised strategy focused first on preventing pulmonary TB in adolescents and adults who are the main source of transmission, and encouraging evaluations of novel efficacy endpoints. Renewed enthusiasm for TB vaccine research has also been stimulated by recent preclinical and clinical advancements. These include new insights into underlying protective immune responses, including potential roles for ‘trained’ innate immunity and Th1/Th17 CD4+ (and CD8+) T cells. The field has been further reinvigorated by two positive proof of concept efficacy trials: one evaluating a potential new use of BCG in preventing high risk populations from sustained Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection and the second evaluating a novel, adjuvanted, recombinant protein vaccine candidate (M72/AS01(E)) for prevention of disease in adults already infected. Fourteen additional candidates are currently in various phases of clinical evaluation and multiple approaches to next generation vaccines are in discovery and preclinical development. The two positive efficacy trials and recent studies in nonhuman primates have enabled the first opportunities to discover candidate vaccine-induced correlates of protection, an effort being undertaken by a broad research consortium.","Scriba, Thomas J.; Netea, Mihai G.; Ginsberg, Ann M.",Semin Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33279383/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.smim.2020.101431,16
685658,Impact of broader geographic allograft sharing on outcomes and cost in smaller lung transplant centers,2020-09-06,"The Beclin family, including yeast Atg6 (autophagy related gene 6), its orthologs in higher eukaryotic species, and the more recently characterized mammalian-specific Beclin 2, are essential molecules in autophagy and other membrane-trafficking events. Extensive studies of Beclin orthologs have provided considerable insights into the regulation of autophagy, the diverse roles of autophagy in physiology and disease, and potential new strategies to modulate autophagy in a variety of clinical diseases. In this review we discuss the functions of Beclin 1 orthologs, the regulation of such functions by diverse cellular signaling pathways, and the effects of such regulation on downstream cellular processes including tumor suppression and metabolism. These findings suggest that Beclin orthologs serve as crucial molecules that integrate diverse environmental signals with membrane trafficking events to ensure optimal responses of the cell to stressful stimuli.","Levine, Beth; Liu, Rong; Dong, Xiaonan; Zhong, Qing",Trends in Cell Biology,http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4554927?pdf=render; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26071895/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096289241500094X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S096289241500094X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tcb.2015.05.004,16
687255,Commentary: Lung Donation after Circulatory Death in the United States. Current and Future Challenges,2020-05-15,"The objective of this study is to analyse the effect of a pandemic shock on the well-being of the European population aged 50 or over. Data comes from wave 7 of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), carried out in 28 countries and representing over 170 million aged individuals in Europe. We start by designing two indicators in order to capture the risk of being unhealthy and economically vulnerable; next, we combine them with socio-demographic information and obtain the vulnerability profiles by means of the k-prototypes clustering algorithm. Subsequently, we design a shock similar to the COVID-19 pandemic and measure its effects on the vulnerability profiles. The results suggest that the average level of economic and health vulnerability is relatively low, although levels differ across European regions, with the most vulnerable being Eastern European countries. It was observed that the shock most affected countries with a greater proportion of individuals initially deemed vulnerable in terms of mental and physical health, as well as countries where tourism and retail sectors are the most vital for their economies. These findings led us to conclude that public policies should be differentiated by European regions, and Governments must establish action plans in order to better meet the physical and mental health needs of their citizens, as well as addressing monetary poverty and financial difficulties.","Grané, Aurea; Albarrán, Irene; Merchán, David E.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33925357/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18094620,16

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aimed to describe the characteristics of the early literature and estimate point prevalences for neurological and neuropsychiatric manifestations. Methods We searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycInfo and CINAHL up to 18 July 2020 for randomised controlled trials, cohort studies, case-control studies, cross-sectional studies and case series. Studies reporting prevalences of neurological or neuropsychiatric symptoms were synthesised into meta-analyses to estimate pooled prevalence. Results 13,292 records were screened by at least two authors to identify 215 included studies, of which there were 37 cohort studies, 15 case-control studies, 80 cross-sectional studies and 83 case series from 30 countries. 147 studies were included in the meta-analysis. The symptoms with the highest prevalence were anosmia (43.1% [35.2-51.3], n=15,975, 63 studies), weakness (40.0% [27.9-53.5], n=221, 3 studies), fatigue (37.8% [31.6-44.4], n=21,101, 67 studies), dysgeusia (37.2% [30.0-45.3], n=13,686, 52 studies), myalgia (25.1% [19.8-31.3], n=66.268, 76 studies), depression (23.0 % [11.8-40.2], n=43,128, 10 studies), headache (20.7% [95% CI 16.1-26.1], n=64,613, 84 studies), anxiety (15.9% [5.6-37.7], n=42,566, 9 studies) and altered mental status (8.2% [4.4-14.8], n=49,326, 19 studies). Heterogeneity for most clinical manifestations was high. Conclusions Neurological and neuropsychiatric symptoms of COVID-19 in the pandemic's early phase are varied and common. The neurological and psychiatric academic communities should develop systems to facilitate high-quality methodologies, including more rapid examination of the longitudinal course of neuropsychiatric complications of newly emerging diseases and their relationship to neuroimaging and inflammatory biomarkers.","Rogers, J.

689617,Change in Physical Activity During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Lockdown in Norway: The Buffering Effect of Resilience on Mental Health,2020-12-15,"INTRODUCTION: CBT-I is the gold standard treatment for insomnia, but access to in-person care is limited, which has worsened due to the recent COVID-19 pandemic. While providers across spheres of care have rapidly pivoted to telehealth there have been few systematic comparisons of in-person treatments to telemedicine approaches. The current study, launched pre-COVID, aimed to examine the perspectives of patients who were randomly assigned to receive CBT-I in-person or via telemedicine. Additionally, provider reflections were collected. METHODS: Individuals with DSM5 Insomnia Disorder (n=60) were randomized to in-person CBT-I, telemedicine CBT-I or a wait-list control group. CBT-I was delivered over 6–8 weekly sessions by video telemedicine or in-person. This nested qualitative study addressed patient and provider perspectives on treatment approaches. A sample of participants from each group (n=36) were interviewed 3 months post-treatment. Phone interviews were audio recorded, transcribed and analyzed using a directed content analysis approach. Results were organized into thematic categories including 1) participant experience with CBT-I, 2) access issues and 3) accountability issues related to delivery approach. Additionally, participating providers (n=7) were interviewed and shared their reflections on delivering CBT-I in-person vs. telemedicine. RESULTS: Patients reflected positively on CBT-I, and this did not vary across treatment groups. Patients and providers noted telemedicine benefits related to access that included, but were not limited to, reducing transportation barriers to treatment and improved continuity of care (e.g. not having to cancel an appointment if a patient was traveling). Patients and providers shared concerns they had anticipated pre-treatment about possible telemedicine related technological hurdles and barriers to establishing meaningful rapport on-line. However, they reported that these concerns did not prove to be barriers to effective telemedicine visits. CONCLUSION: This qualitative study allowed patients and their providers to reflect on their experience delivering in-person vs telemedicine CBT-I. CBT-I was accepted well regardless of delivery approach. Telemedicine is currently being deployed widely and this study provides a systematic comparison between approaches. SUPPORT (IF ANY): This study was supported by the American Sleep Medicine Foundation.","Gunter, Paul; Gehrman, Philip; Findley, James; Kayser, Matthew; Kuna, Samuel; Frasso, Rosemary",Sleep,https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/zsab072.810,16

A recent warning from WHO on systemic corticosteroid use amid COVID-19 raised suspicion among public and healthcare professionals regarding the safety of steroid use during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The corticosteroids (inhaled and oral) are commonly prescribed in the management of asthma and COPD patients and any unsolicited changes in medications use may lead to potentially severe exacerbations and risk patient lives. This article provides a critical review of clinical evidence and offers a detailed discussion on the safety and efficacy of corticosteroids in asthma and COPD patients, both with and without COVID-19.","Hasan, Syed Shahzad; Capstick, Toby; Razi Zaidi, Syed Tabish; Kow, Chia Siang; Merchant, Hamid A.",Respir Med,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0954611120301852; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0954611120301852?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rmed.2020.106045; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32843175/,16
