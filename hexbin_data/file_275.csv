1236,The Emergent Discipline of Health Web Science,2013-08-22,"The transformative power of the Internet on all aspects of daily life, including health care, has been widely recognized both in the scientific literature and in public discourse. Viewed through the various lenses of diverse academic disciplines, these transformations reveal opportunities realized, the promise of future advances, and even potential problems created by the penetration of the World Wide Web for both individuals and for society at large. Discussions about the clinical and health research implications of the widespread adoption of information technologies, including the Internet, have been subsumed under the disciplinary label of Medicine 2.0. More recently, however, multi-disciplinary research has emerged that is focused on the achievement and promise of the Web itself, as it relates to healthcare issues. In this paper, we explore and interrogate the contributions of the burgeoning field of Web Science in relation to health maintenance, health care, and health policy. From this, we introduce Health Web Science as a subdiscipline of Web Science, distinct from but overlapping with Medicine 2.0. This paper builds on the presentations and subsequent interdisciplinary dialogue that developed among Web-oriented investigators present at the 2012 Medicine 2.0 Conference in Boston, Massachusetts.","Luciano, Joanne S; Cumming, Grant P; Wilkinson, Mark D; Kahana, Eva",J Med Internet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3758025/,275
1786,Social Media as a Sensor of Air Quality and Public Response in China,2015-03-26,"BACKGROUND: Recent studies have demonstrated the utility of social media data sources for a wide range of public health goals, including disease surveillance, mental health trends, and health perceptions and sentiment. Most such research has focused on English-language social media for the task of disease surveillance. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the value of Chinese social media for monitoring air quality trends and related public perceptions and response. The goal was to determine if this data is suitable for learning actionable information about pollution levels and public response. METHODS: We mined a collection of 93 million messages from Sina Weibo, China’s largest microblogging service. We experimented with different filters to identify messages relevant to air quality, based on keyword matching and topic modeling. We evaluated the reliability of the data filters by comparing message volume per city to air particle pollution rates obtained from the Chinese government for 74 cities. Additionally, we performed a qualitative study of the content of pollution-related messages by coding a sample of 170 messages for relevance to air quality, and whether the message included details such as a reactive behavior or a health concern. RESULTS: The volume of pollution-related messages is highly correlated with particle pollution levels, with Pearson correlation values up to .718 (n=74, P<.001). Our qualitative results found that 67.1% (114/170) of messages were relevant to air quality and of those, 78.9% (90/114) were a firsthand report. Of firsthand reports, 28% (32/90) indicated a reactive behavior and 19% (17/90) expressed a health concern. Additionally, 3 messages of 170 requested that action be taken to improve quality. CONCLUSIONS: We have found quantitatively that message volume in Sina Weibo is indicative of true particle pollution levels, and we have found qualitatively that messages contain rich details including perceptions, behaviors, and self-reported health effects. Social media data can augment existing air pollution surveillance data, especially perception and health-related data that traditionally requires expensive surveys or interviews.","Wang, Shiliang; Paul, Michael J; Dredze, Mark",J Med Internet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4400579/,275

13070,Public Disclosure on Social Media of Identifiable Patient Information by Health Professionals: Content Analysis of Twitter Data,2020-09-01,"In developed countries, most people living with HIV/AIDS are treated with costly brand single-tablet regimens. Given the economic impact, French guidelines recommend using generic antiretroviral therapy when possible to decrease antiretroviral therapy costs. We aimed to study HIV-infected patients’ acceptability to switch from a brand single-tablet regimens [abacavir/lamivudine/dolutegravir (Triumeq(®)) or emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/rilpivirine (Eviplera(®))] to a treatment comprising of two pills: one is a fixed-dose generic combination of 2 Nucleoside Analogs and the second tablet is the third antiretroviral. This study was a prospective observational study in a French hospital. During their follow-up, patients on stable single-tablet regimens were made aware of the possible cost-saving. They were questioned about their willingness and barriers accepting the substitution. Participants chose between the two regimens, either to remain on single-tablet regimens or switch to the de-simplified regimen. Six months later, a second survey was given to the patient who chose to de-simplify and HIV viral load was controlled. The study included 98 patients: 60 receiving emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/rilpivirine (Eviplera(®)) and 38 on abacavir/lamivudine/dolutegravir (Triumeq(®)). Forty-five patients accepted the de-simplified treatment, 37 refused and 16 were undecided and followed the decision offered by their physician. The main reason for unwillingness to switch is the number of pills (77.3%). In multivariate model analysis, male patients (p = 0.001) who have taken antiretroviral therapy for over 20 years (p = 0.04) and who retrieve their treatment in their community hospital (p = 0.03) are more likely to accept the switch. Fifty-one patients accepted to replace their single-tablet regimens and six months later, the majority was satisfied; only four returned to single-tablet regimens because of suspected side effects. Half of the people living with HIV/AIDS in our cohort accepted to switch from brand single-tablet regimens to a two-tablet regimen containing generic drugs within a process that emphasizes health expenditure savings.","Giraud, Jean-Stephane; Doisne, Melanie; Chan Hew Wai, Aurelie; Majerholc, Catherine; Fourn, Erwan; Sejean, Karine; Trichereau, Julie; Bonan, Brigitte; Zucman, David",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7518587/,275
13360,"Factors associated with low contraceptive use amongst vulnerable mothers in South West State, Nigeria",2020-09-18,"Lyme disease is the most common vector-borne disease in North America. The etiological agent is the spirochete Borreliella burgdorferi, transmitted to mammalian hosts by the Ixodes tick. In recent years there has been an increase in the number of cases of Lyme disease. Currently, there is no vaccine on the market for human use. We describe the development of a novel synthetically engineered DNA vaccine, pLD1 targeting the outer-surface protein A (OspA) of Borreliella burgdorferi. Immunization of C3 H/HeN mice with pLD1 elicits robust humoral and cellular immune responses that confer complete protection against a live Borreliella burgdorferi bacterial challenge. We also assessed intradermal (ID) delivery of pLD1 in Hartley guinea pigs, demonstrating the induction of robust and durable humoral immunity that lasts at least 1 year. We provide evidence of the potency of pLD1 by showing that antibodies targeting the OspA epitopes which have been associated with protection are prominently raised in the immunized guinea pigs. The described study provides the basis for the advancement of pDL1 as a potential vaccine for Lyme disease control.","Guibinga, Ghiabe H.; Sahay, Bikash; Brown, Heather; Cooch, Neil; Chen, Jing; Yan, Jian; Reed, Charles; Mishra, Meerambika; Yung, Bryan; Pugh, Holly; Schultheis, Katherine; Esquivel, Rianne N.; Weiner, David B.; Humeau, Laurent H.; Broderick, Kate E.; Smith, Trevor R.F.",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7553707/,275

15266,The Role of Technology and Social Media Use in Sleep-Onset Difficulties Among Italian Adolescents: Cross-sectional Study,2021-01-21,"A bacteriocin from Bacillus subtilis (MK733983) originated from ethnomedicinal plant was purified using Preparative RP-HPLC. The HPLC fraction eluted with 65% acetonitrile showed the highest antimicrobial activity with Mycobacterium smegmatis as an indicator. Its specific activity and purification fold increased by 70.5% and 44%, respectively, compared to the crude bacteriocin. The bacteriocin showed stability over a wide range of pH (3.0–8.0) and preservation (− 20 °C and 4 °C), also thermal stability up to 80 °C for 20 min. Its proteinaceous nature was confirmed with complete loss of activity on its treatment with Trypsin, Proteinase K, and α-Chymotrypsin. Nevertheless, the bacteriocin retained up to 45% activity with Papainase treatment and was unaffected by salivary Amylase. It maintained ~ 95% activity on UV exposure up to 3 h and its activity was augmented by ethyl alcohol and metal ions like Fe(2+) and Mn(2+). Most of the common organic solvents, general surfactants, preservatives, and detergents like Sulfobetaine-14, Deoxy-cholic-acid did not affect the bacteriocin’s action. Its molecular weight was estimated to be 3.4KDa by LC-ESI-MS/MS analysis. The bacteriocin is non-hemolytic and exhibited a broad inhibition spectrum with standard strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Chromobacterium violaceum with MICs ranging 0.225 ± 0.02–0.55 ± 0.05 mg/mL. Scanning Electron Microscopy showed cell annihilation with pores in cell membranes of S. aureus and P. aeruginosa treated with the bacteriocin, implicating bactericidal mode of action. These promising results suggest that the bacteriocin is significant and has wide-ranging application prospects.

16584,6 vragen over het Janssen-vaccin en een update over bijwerkingen,2021-04-01,"Tackling air pollution has become of utmost importance since the last few decades. Different statistical as well as deep learning methods have been proposed till now, but seldom those have been used to forecast future long-term pollution trends. Forecasting long-term pollution trends into the future is highly important for government bodies around the globe as they help in the framing of efficient environmental policies. This paper presents a comparative study of various statistical and deep learning methods to forecast long-term pollution trends for the two most important categories of particulate matter (PM) which are PM2.5 and PM10. The study is based on Kolkata, a major city on the eastern side of India. The historical pollution data collected from government set-up monitoring stations in Kolkata are used to analyse the underlying patterns with the help of various time-series analysis techniques, which is then used to produce a forecast for the next two years using different statistical and deep learning methods. The findings reflect that statistical methods such as auto-regressive (AR), seasonal auto-regressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) and Holt–Winters outperform deep learning methods such as stacked, bi-directional, auto-encoder and convolution long short-term memory networks based on the limited data available.","Nath, Pritthijit; Saha, Pratik; Middya, Asif Iqbal; Roy, Sarbani",Neural Comput Appl,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8019307/,275
16902,The mental health of Welsh dentists during the pandemic,2021-04-23,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: A link between telomere length and some age-related diseases has been identified, including metabolic syndrome. So far, there is no mechanism to explain the origin or cause of telomere shortening in this syndrome; however, oxidative stress is a constant factor. Therefore, we reviewed scientific evidence that supported the association between oxidative stress and telomere length dynamics, also examining how each of the metabolic syndrome components individually affects the length. In this regard, there is strong scientific evidence that an increase in the number of metabolic syndrome components is associated with a shorter telomere length, oxidative damage at the lipid and DNA level, and inflammation, as well as its other components, such as obesity, hyperglycemia, and hypertension, while for dyslipidemia, there is a little more discrepancy. The difficulty for the correct treatment of metabolic syndrome lies in its multifactorial nature. Hence, there is a need to carry out more studies on healthy lifestyles during aging to prevent and reduce oxidative damage and telomere wear during aging, and consequently the progression of chronic degenerative diseases, thus improving the living conditions of older people. ABSTRACT: A great amount of scientific evidence supports that Oxidative Stress (OxS) can contribute to telomeric attrition and also plays an important role in the development of certain age-related diseases, among them the metabolic syndrome (MetS), which is characterised by clinical and biochemical alterations such as obesity, dyslipidaemia, arterial hypertension, hyperglycaemia, and insulin resistance, all of which are considered as risk factors for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and cardiovascular diseases, which are associated in turn with an increase of OxS. In this sense, we review scientific evidence that supports the association between OxS with telomere length (TL) dynamics and the relationship with MetS components in aging. It was analysed whether each MetS component affects the telomere length separately or if they all affect it together. Likewise, this review provides a summary of the structure and function of telomeres and telomerase, the mechanisms of telomeric DNA repair, how telomere length may influence the fate of cells or be linked to inflammation and the development of age-related diseases, and finally, how the lifestyles can affect telomere length.","Gavia-García, Graciela; Rosado-Pérez, Juana; Arista-Ugalde, Taide Laurita; Aguiñiga-Sánchez, Itzen; Santiago-Osorio, Edelmiro; Mendoza-Núñez, Víctor Manuel",Biology (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8063797/,275
17860,New Mental Health Wellness initiative launched,2021-05-28,"Programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) is a mechanism used by arteriviruses like porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) to generate multiple proteins from overlapping reading frames within its RNA genome. PRRSV employs −1 PRF directed by RNA secondary and tertiary structures within its viral genome (canonical PRF), as well as a noncanonical −1 and −2 PRF that are stimulated by the interactions of PRRSV nonstructural protein 1β (nsp1β) and host protein poly(C)-binding protein (PCBP) 1 or 2 with the viral genome. Together, nsp1β and one of the PCBPs act as transactivators that bind a C-rich motif near the shift site to stimulate −1 and −2 PRF, thereby enabling the ribosome to generate two frameshift products that are implicated in viral immune evasion. How nsp1β and PCBP associate with the viral RNA genome remains unclear. Here, we describe the purification of the nsp1β:PCBP2:viral RNA complex on a scale sufficient for structural analysis using small-angle X-ray scattering and stochiometric analysis by analytical ultracentrifugation. The proteins associate with the RNA C-rich motif as a 1:1:1 complex. The monomeric form of nsp1β within the complex differs from previously reported homodimer identified by X-ray crystallography. Functional analysis of the complex via mutational analysis combined with RNA-binding assays and cell-based frameshifting reporter assays reveal a number of key residues within nsp1β and PCBP2 that are involved in complex formation and function. Our results suggest that nsp1β and PCBP2 both interact directly with viral RNA during formation of the complex to coordinate this unusual PRF mechanism.","Patel, Ankoor; Treffers, Emmely E.; Meier, Markus; Patel, Trushar R.; Stetefeld, Jörg; Snijder, Eric J.; Mark, Brian L.",J Biol Chem,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7939443/,275
18026,Comparing models of delivery for cancer genetics services among patients receiving primary care who meet criteria for genetic evaluation in two healthcare systems: BRIDGE randomized controlled trial,2021-06-02,"Chytridiomycosis is an emerging infectious disease affecting amphibians globally and it is caused by the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). Chytridiomycosis has caused dramatic declines and even extinctions in wild amphibian populations in Europe, Australia, Central and North America. Spanning over two and a half decades, extensive research has led to discovery of epizootic and enzootic lineages of this pathogen. However, the Bd–amphibian system had garnered less attention in Asia until recently when an ancestral Bd lineage was identified in the Korean peninsula. Amphibians co-exist with the pathogen in Asia, only sub-lethal effects have been documented on hosts. Such regions are ‘coldspots’ of infection and are an important resource to understand the dynamics between the enzootic pathogen—Bd and its obligate host—amphibians. Insights into the biology of infection have provided new knowledge on the multi-faceted interaction of Bd in a hyperdiverse Asian amphibian community. We present the findings and highlight the knowledge gap that exists, and propose the ways to bridge them. We emphasize that chytridiomycosis in Asia is an important wildlife disease and it needs focussed research, as it is a dynamic front of pathogen diversity and virulence.","Sreedharan, Gayathri; Vasudevan, Karthikeyan",J Indian Inst Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8171229/,275
18108,"High prevalence of overall overweight/obesity and abdominal obesity amongst adolescents: An emerging nutritional problem in rural high schools in Limpopo Province, South Africa",2021-05-18,"BACKGROUND: Despite good access to antenatal care (ANC) services for most women, and regular training of healthcare workers in obstetrics and gynaecology, many pregnant women with a previous history of caesarean section (C/S) still presented late for ANC services at Letsholathebe II Memorial Hospital (LIIMH) in Maun, Botswana. This may increase morbidity and mortality in women with previous C/S delivery and neonates. Knowing why women with previous C/S present late for ANC may help in the formulation of interventions that decrease morbidity and mortality amongst these women and neonates. AIM: The aim of this study was to explore the reasons why pregnant women with a previous history of C/S registered late for ANC, at LIIMH. SETTING: This study was performed at LIIMH, a district hospital situated in Maun, Botswana. METHODS: This was a descriptive qualitative study. Consenting pregnant women with previous C/S who presented at LIIMH after the 20 weeks of pregnancy were interviewed until data saturation. The data was analysed for themes. RESULTS: The reasons for late registration at LIIMH include lack of information, misconception on the appropriate booking time and venue, dissatisfaction with the quality of ANC clinic services, use of alternative ANC providers, delayed referral, and pregnancy experience. CONCLUSION: Lack of knowledge of ANC delivery venue, using alternative ANC providers, and dissatisfaction with ANC clinic services, contributed to late registration. Pregnant women with previous history of C/S should be informed about ANC, delivery plans, and the assistance of alternative ANC providers should be explored.","Ramotsababa, Mareko; Setlhare, Vincent",Afr J Prim Health Care Fam Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8182559/,275

The objective of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of adalimumab in patients with moderate-to-severe HS. METHODS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines. Pooled estimates, namely standardized mean difference (SMD) and relative risk (RR), were calculated using random-effect model with trial sequential analysis. Small study effects were examined using the Doi plot. Certainty of evidence (CoE) was assessed using “The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation” approach, and number-needed-to-treat (NNT) was calculated. RESULTS: Five randomized controlled trials, involving 1014 patients, were included. We performed subgroup analysis of adalimumab administered subcutaneously both weekly and every other week. Adalimumab administered weekly was associated with better clinical response achievement (RR 1.76, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.35–2.29; trial sequential analysis TSA-adjusted CI 1.01–3.08; CoE: low; NNT = 5) and a significant improvement in modified Sartorius score (SMD = −0.45, 95% CI = −0.76 to −0.13; CoE: very low; NNT = 10) and dermatology life quality index (DLQI) (SMD −0.47, 95% CI −0.61 to −0.32; CoE: low; NNT = 10). Nevertheless, adalimumab administered every other week showed an improvement only in modified Sartorius score. The pooled RRs of adverse events in both groups revealed no statistical significance when compared with the placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Adalimumab administered weekly resulted in not only better clinical responses than placebo but also significantly improved disease severity and quality of life of patients with moderate-to-severe HS.

However, whether air pollution (AP) serves as a risk factor for post-adolescent acne remains elusive. AIM: To determine the relationship between short-term AP exposure (within 7 days) and outpatient visits for post-adolescent acne. METHODS: Daily outpatient visit data for post-adolescent acne and routinely AP data between 2010 and 2013 were collected from Xi’an, China. A generalized additive regression model was used to analyze the relationship between outpatient visits for post-adolescent acne and short-term ambient AP exposure. The gender-specific analyses were conducted as well. RESULTS: Totally, 27,190 outpatient visits for post-adolescent acne were included. The results revealed that a 10 μg/m(3) increase in PM(10), SO(2), and NO(2) at lag 0–7 day was associated with the increase of outpatient visits for post-adolescent acne at 0.84% (95% CI: 0.53%, 1.16%), 1.61% (95% CI: 0.12%, 3.10%), and 3.50% (95% CI: 1.60%, 5.40%), respectively. The significant positive associations of PM(10), SO(2), and NO(2) were found at both single-lag models and moving average models. The gender-specific analyses showed that the effect estimates of PM(10) was stronger for females than for males, while there was no observed gender difference in the effects of SO(2) and NO(2).

We investigated resilience in patients affected by urologic chronic pelvic pain (UCPP) and the relationships with pain severity and distribution, catastrophizing and psychological distress. METHODS: Forty‐eight consecutive UCPP patients were classified on a pain body map as being affected by pelvic pain only or widespread pain (WP), and underwent the evaluation of resilience with the 14‐item Resilience Scale (RS‐14), with higher scores indicating high resilience levels; scores < 56 denote very poor resilience. Pelvic and nonpelvic pain intensity and the bother of urinary symptoms on QoL were measured by means of Pain Numerical Rating Scale (PNRS) and Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) and Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS‐21) investigated catastrophizing and psychological conditions. RESULTS: Overall, RS‐14 mean ± SD total score was 50.2 ± 12.5 in patients with pelvic pain only and 40.2 ± 10.2 in those with WP. Significant relationships were observed between low resilience levels and high scores of pelvic and nonpelvic PNRS, VAS, pain catastrophizing scale and depression and anxiety, stress scale (for all: p < 0.001). Significantly lower RS‐14 scores were detected in females and in patients with WP. CONCLUSIONS: A very poor resilience has been identified in UCPP patients, particularly in those with greater catastrophizing and mood alterations. WP and female gender were mostly affected. In UCPP patients, low resilience appears as a crucial factor in pain experience.","Giannantoni, Antonella; Gubbiotti, Marilena; Balzarro, Matteo; Rubilotta, Emanuele",Neurourol Urodyn,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8252554/,275

Persons with HCV/HIV and living with substance use are disadvantaged in benefiting from advances in HCV treatment. METHODS: In this randomized controlled trial, participants with HCV/HIV were randomized between February 2016 and January 2017 to either care facilitation or control. Twelve-month follow-up assessments were completed in January 2018. Care facilitation group participants received motivation and strengths-based case management addressing retrieval of HCV viral load results, engagement in HCV/HIV care, and medication adherence. Control group participants received referral to HCV evaluation and an offer of assistance in making care appointments. Primary outcome was number of steps achieved along a series of 8 clinical steps (eg, receiving HCV results, initiating treatment, sustained virologic response [SVR]) of the HCV/HIV care continuum over 12 months postrandomization. RESULTS: Three hundred eighty-one individuals were screened and 113 randomized. Median age was 51 years; 58.4% of participants were male and 72.6% were Black/African American. Median HIV-1 viral load was 27 209 copies/mL, with 69% having a detectable viral load. Mean number of steps completed was statistically significantly higher in the intervention group vs controls (2.44 vs 1.68 steps; χ (2) [1] = 7.36, P = .0067). Men in the intervention group completed a statistically significantly higher number of steps than controls. Eleven participants achieved SVR with no difference by treatment group. CONCLUSIONS: The care facilitation intervention increased progress along the HCV/HIV care continuum, as observed for men and not women. Study findings also highlight continued challenges to achieve individual-patient SVR and population-level HCV elimination.

21574,Personal and Emotional Factors of Nursing Professionals Related to Coping with End-of-Life Care: A Cross-Sectional Study,2021-09-09,"BACKGROUND: Bluetongue is a serious disease of ruminants caused by the bluetongue virus (BTV). BTV is transmitted by biting midges (Culicoides spp.). Serological evidence from livestock and the presence of at least one competent vector species of Culicoides suggests that transmission of BTV is possible and may have occurred in Kazakhstan. METHODS: We estimated the risk of transmission using a mathematical model of the reproduction number R(0) for bluetongue. This model depends on livestock density and climatic factors which affect vector density. Data on climate and livestock numbers from the 2466 local communities were used. This, together with previously published model parameters, was used to estimate R(0) for each month of the year. We plotted the results on isopleth maps of Kazakhstan using interpolation to smooth the irregular data. We also mapped the estimated proportion of the population requiring vaccination to prevent outbreaks of bluetongue. RESULTS: The results suggest that transmission of bluetongue in Kazakhstan is not possible in the winter from October to March. Assuming there are vector-competent species of Culicoides endemic in Kazakhstan, then low levels of risk first appear in the south of Kazakhstan in April before spreading north and intensifying, reaching maximum levels in northern Kazakhstan in July. The risk declined in September and had disappeared by October. CONCLUSION: These results should aid in surveillance efforts for the detection and control of bluetongue in Kazakhstan by indicating where and when outbreaks of bluetongue are most likely to occur. The results also indicate where vaccination efforts should be focussed to prevent outbreaks of disease.

40302,3 Vragen over: Excuses maken in tuchtrechtelijke procedures,2020-10-01,"PURPOSE: The present paper discusses the technical assistance for electrical equipment under sanitary surveillance by analyzing Brazilian regulations and legislation and proposes an improved post-market approach based on international standards. METHODS: Brazilian legal and regulatory documentation was the basis of this research. The time span from 2000 to 2020 was used to review the legislation. The actual post-market practice in Brazil was examined in detail, and it was pointed out that there is a clear dichotomy between the legal foundation and the patient protective practice. RESULTS: The Brazilian National Health Surveillance Agency regulates and the Brazilian National Institute of Metrology, Quality, and Technology owns the conformity assessment scheme of medical electrical equipment under a sanitary surveillance system. The conformity assessment is based on a certification process using technical standard series IEC 60601. The certification in its present form does not consider any active post-market surveillance, which is a potential risk for the final users because of the varied medical electrical equipment. From the consumer protection perspective, the objective responsibility of service providers includes accountability to the eventual harm caused by the equipment in normal operation. Therefore, a clear regulation or legislation on post-market technical assistance is of interest to the medical industry and technicians. CONCLUSION: The prospective assurance of the safety and performance of the well-being of citizens would be much more probable to be assured with the renewing of legislation on the post-market evaluation of medical electrical equipment, mainly if international technical standards are used. The dissemination of available medical electrical equipment technology would consequently help public health. Revising the post-market surveillance approach could lead to a better response to deal with medical electrical equipment maintenance issues.","do Nascimento, Jorge Luiz Guerra; Costa-Felix, Rodrigo P.

Despite the many facets of digital health, there has been a greater slant in interest and focus on artificial intelligence recently. Other major elements of digital health such as mobile health could also substantially impact patient-focused outcomes but have been relatively less explored and discussed. In this review, we adopted a narrative approach to comprehensively evaluate the use of non-AI digital health tools in ophthalmology. 53 papers were included in this systematic review, with 25 papers dealing with virtual or augmented reality, 14 with mobile applications, and 14 with wearables. Most papers focused on the use of these technologies to detect or rehabilitate visual impairment, glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration. Overall, the findings present encouraging improvements on patient-focused outcomes with the adoption of these technologies. Further validation or large-scale studies and earlier consideration of real-world barriers are warranted to enable better real-world implementation.","Tseng, Rachel Marjorie Wei Wen; Tham, Yih-Chung; Rim, Tyler Hyungtaek; Cheng, Ching-Yu",Clinical & experimental ophthalmology,https://doi.org/10.1111/ceo.13971; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34235833/,275

Although COVID-19 is caused by infection in the respiratory tract, extrapulmonary manifestations including dysregulation of the immune system and hepatic injury have been observed. Given the high prevalence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in China, we sought to study the impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and HBV coinfection in patients. METHODS Blood samples of 50 SARS-CoV-2 and HBV coinfected patients, 56 SARS-CoV-2 mono-infected patients, 57 HBeAg-negative chronic HBV patient controls and 57 healthy controls admitted to Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University were collected in this study. Complete blood count and serum biochemistry panels including markers indicative of liver functions were performed. Cytokines including IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6 and IL-10 were evaluated. T cell, B cell and NK cell counts were measured using flow cytometry. RESULTS SARS-CoV-2 and HBV coinfection did not significantly affect the outcome of the COVID-19. However, at the onset of COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 and HBV coinfected patients showed more severe monocytopenia and thrombocytopenia as well as more disturbed hepatic function in albumin production and lipid metabolism. Most of the disarrangement could be reversed after recovery from COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS While chronic HBV infection did not predispose COVID-19 patients to more severe outcomes, our data suggests SARS-CoV-2 and HBV coinfection poses a higher extent of dysregulation of host functions at the onset of COVID-19. Thus, caution needs to be taken with the management of SARS-CoV-2 and HBV coinfected patients.","Liu, Rui; Zhao, Li; Cheng, Xiaoming; Huan, Han; Li, Cong; Li, Dong; Liu, Andrew; Gao, Guosheng; Zhou, Feng; Liu, Fang; Jiang, Yingan; Zhu, Chengliang; Xia, Yuchen",Liver international : official journal of the International Association for the Study of the Liver,https://doi.org/10.1111/liv.14774; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33351265/,275
152102,"Mapping geographical inequalities in access to drinking water and sanitation facilities in low-income and middle-income countries, 2000-17.",2020-09-01,"Plant defensive mimicry based on the aphid alarm pheromone (E)-β-farnesene (EβF) was previously shown to operate in Tanacetum cinerariifolium (Asteraceae) flowers. Germacrene D (GD), is another dominant volatile of T. cinerariifolium flowers and may modulate both defense and pollination. Here, we find that the increase in GD/EβF ratio at later developmental stages is correlated with the tissue distribution in the flower head: the total content of EβF and GD is similar, but GD accumulates comparatively more in the upper disk florets. Naphthol and N, N-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (NADI)-stained purple ducts containing EβF and GD, were observed in the five petal lips of the corolla and two-lobed stigma of disk florets. By contrast in the peduncle, EβF accounts for nearly 80% of total terpenes, compared to 5% for GD. EβF is accumulated inside inner cortex cells and parenchyma cells of the pith in young peduncle. This is followed by the formation of terpene-filled axial secretory cavities parallel to the vascular bundles. In conclusion, the observed developmental and diurnal emissions of different EβF/GD ratios appear to be regulated by their tissue distribution.","Li, Jinjin; Hu, Hao; Chen, Yu; Xie, Jing; Li, Jiawen; Zeng, Tuo; Wang, Manqun; Luo, Jing; Zheng, Riru; Jongsma, Maarten A; Wang, Caiyun",Phytochemistry,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phytochem.2021.112768; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33932787/,275

Comparing to facts that could be labeled as true or false, we are more concerned about contaminative negative emotions transferring digitally among users. In this study, we explored an emotional contagion effect among misinformation discussion participants on Twitter. We analyzed the sentiment of 573 tweets in 192 discussion threads. Our result revealed that highly emotional tweets do not have a universal effect on the online discussions, but it affects those individuals with limited social and personal identity cues (i.e., being anonymous). We found that anonymous members of the online discussion are more susceptible to emotional contagions than those are not.

Cytopathic effects, such as vacuolation, formation of syncytia, and fusion of cells, were detected even at passage 1 of the PEDV in Vero cells. Once adapted, the virus induced numerous syncytia containing over 100 nuclei. From virus passage 5 on, all cells forming the monolayer were fused and totally destroyed within 24 h after inoculation. Cell culture-grown PEDV had typical coronavirus morphology when viewed by electron microscopy.

Chains of infections starting from various countries worldwide seeded the outbreak of COVID-19 in Athens, capital city of Greece. A full-genome analysis of isolates from Athens' hospitals and other healthcare providers revealed the variety of SARS-CoV-2 that initiated the pandemic before lockdown and passenger flight restrictions. A dominant variant, encompassing the G614D amino acid substitution, spread through a major virus dispersal event, and sporadic introductions of rare variants characterized the local initiation of the epidemic. Mutations within the genome highlighted the genetic drift of the virus as rare variants emerged. An important variant contained a premature stop codon in orf7a leading to the truncation of a possibly important for viral pathogenesis domain. This study may serve as a reference for resolving future lines of infection in the area, especially after resumption of passenger flight connections to Athens and Greece during summer of 2020.","Spanakis, Nikolaos; Kassela, Katerina; Dovrolis, Nikolas; Bampali, Maria; Gatzidou, Elisavet; Kafasi, Athanasia; Froukala, Elisavet; Stavropoulou, Anastasia; Lilakos, Konstantinos; Veletza, Stavroula; Tsiodras, Sotirios; Tsakris, Athanasios; Karakasiliotis, Ioannis",J. med. virol,,275

However, there are limited data on efficacy and associated adverse events. Objective: To describe the association between use of hydroxychloroquine, with or without azithromycin, and clinical outcomes among hospital inpatients diagnosed with COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective multicenter cohort study of patients from a random sample of all admitted patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in 25 hospitals, representing 88.2% of patients with COVID-19 in the New York metropolitan region. Eligible patients were admitted for at least 24 hours between March 15 and 28, 2020. Medications, preexisting conditions, clinical measures on admission, outcomes, and adverse events were abstracted from medical records. The date of final follow-up was April 24, 2020. Exposures: Receipt of both hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine alone, azithromycin alone, or neither. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were cardiac arrest and abnormal electrocardiogram findings (arrhythmia or QT prolongation). Results: Among 1438 hospitalized patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 (858 [59.7%] male, median age, 63 years), those receiving hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, or both were more likely than those not receiving either drug to have diabetes, respiratory rate >22/min, abnormal chest imaging findings, O2 saturation lower than 90%, and aspartate aminotransferase greater than 40 U/L. Overall in-hospital mortality was 20.3% (95% CI, 18.2%-22.4%). The probability of death for patients receiving hydroxychloroquine + azithromycin was 189/735 (25.7% [95% CI, 22.3%-28.9%]), hydroxychloroquine alone, 54/271 (19.9% [95% CI, 15.2%-24.7%]), azithromycin alone, 21/211 (10.0% [95% CI, 5.9%-14.0%]), and neither drug, 28/221 (12.7% [95% CI, 8.3%-17.1%]). In adjusted Cox proportional hazards models, compared with patients receiving neither drug, there were no significant differences in mortality for patients receiving hydroxychloroquine + azithromycin (HR, 1.35 [95% CI, 0.76-2.40]), hydroxychloroquine alone (HR, 1.08 [95% CI, 0.63-1.85]), or azithromycin alone (HR, 0.56 [95% CI, 0.26-1.21]). In logistic models, compared with patients receiving neither drug cardiac arrest was significantly more likely in patients receiving hydroxychloroquine + azithromycin (adjusted OR, 2.13 [95% CI, 1.12-4.05]), but not hydroxychloroquine alone (adjusted OR, 1.91 [95% CI, 0.96-3.81]) or azithromycin alone (adjusted OR, 0.64 [95% CI, 0.27-1.56]), . In adjusted logistic regression models, there were no significant differences in the relative likelihood of abnormal electrocardiogram findings. Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients hospitalized in metropolitan New York with COVID-19, treatment with hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, or both, compared with neither treatment, was not significantly associated with differences in in-hospital mortality. However, the interpretation of these findings may be limited by the observational design.","Rosenberg, Eli S; Dufort, Elizabeth M; Udo, Tomoko; Wilberschied, Larissa A; Kumar, Jessica; Tesoriero, James; Weinberg, Patti; Kirkwood, James; Muse, Alison; DeHovitz, Jack; Blog, Debra S; Hutton, Brad; Holtgrave, David R; Zucker, Howard A",JAMA,,275

The evidence addressing this topic was generally adjudicated to be of very low quality because of risk of bias and imprecision. Furthermore, there was little direct evidence supporting a role for routine nucleic acid-based testing of respiratory samples in improving critical outcomes such as overall survival or antibiotic use patterns. However, on the basis of direct and indirect evidence, recommendations were made for both outpatient and hospitalized patients with suspected CAP.

These mainly involve the development of antimicrobial, antiviral, and/or anti-inflammatory agents as well as vaccine production. However, other potential options should be more avidly investigated since vaccine production on a worldwide level, and the anti-vaccination movement, also known as anti-vax or vaccine hesitancy by many communities, are still real obstacles without a ready solution. This review presents recent findings on the potential therapeutic advantages of heterologous serotherapy for the treatment of COVID-19. We present not only the effective use in animal models of hyperimmune sera against this coronavirus but also strategies, and protocols for the production of anti-SARS-CoV-2 sera. Promising antigens are also indicated such as the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in SARS-CoV-2 S protein, which is already in phase 2/3 clinical trial, and the trimeric protein S, which was shown to be up to 150 times more potent than the serum from convalescent donors. Due to the high death rate, the treatment for those currently infected with coronavirus cannot be ignored. Therefore, the potential use of anti-SARS-CoV-2 hyperimmune sera should be carefully but urgently evaluated in phase 2/3 clinical studies.","da Costa, Camila B P; Martins, Francislene J; da Cunha, Luis E R; Ratcliffe, Norman A; Cisne de Paula, Rafael; Castro, Helena C",Int Immunopharmacol,,275

The sharp changes in the temperature and normalized pressure sensor signals induced by the abrupt release of hot and high-pressure steam can be clearly monitored during the steam pop phenomena. The basic mechanism of the preliminary steam pop is hypothesized and verified using in situ ultrasound imaging data and computational analysis data of the RFA procedure. Moreover, the usability of the system in clinical trials is investigated, and the steam pop phenomena during the RFA procedure are detected using T-sensor and P-sensor.

Evidence suggests that severe outcomes in COVID19 infection are attributed to the excessive activation of the complement cascade leading to acute lung injury and associated is with an increased prothrombotic state. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 27-year-old Caucasian man with PNH presented to the Emergency Department of our hospital with acute onset shortness of breath, cough and blood in urine. DIAGNOSIS: The patient was diagnosed with acute hemolytic exacerbation of PNH complicated with moderate COVID19 pneumonia. OUTCOMES: The patient was initiated with an anticoagulant unfractionated heparin, dexamethasone, and cefuroxime injection. His symptoms quickly resolved, and he was discharged after 5 days. CONCLUSION: The complement system activation is a critical component in the sequalae of COVID19 infection. Evidence suggests that severe outcomes in COVID19 infection are attributed to the excessive activation of the complement cascade leading to acute lung injury and associated is with an increased prothrombotic state. Notably, C5a concentration was noted to be higher in patients with COVID19 infection. The use of complement inhibitors to attenuate immune mediated damage in COVID19 nevertheless represents a very interesting theoretical approach. However, careful consideration as to which patients may benefit will be required and the outcome of clinical trials needed.","Sokol, Juraj; Nehaj, Frantisek; Mokan, Michal; Lisa, Lenka; Stasko, Jan",Medicine (Baltimore),,275

Digital health promises many opportunities for service provisioning during a pandemic. However, a broad penetration of medical processes with information technology also has drawbacks. Within this work, the authors use the COVID-19 pandemic to analyze the chances and the risks that may come with using digital health solutions for medical care during a pandemic. Therefore, a multi-methods approach is used. First we use a systematic literature review for reviewing the state of the art of digital health applications in healthcare. Furthermore, the usage of digital health applications is mapped to the different processes in care delivery. Here we provide an exemplary process model of oncological care delivery. The analysis shows that including digital health solutions may be helpful for care delivery in most processes of medical care provisioning. However, research on digital health solutions focuses strongly on some few processes and specific disciplines while other processes and medical disciplines are underrepresented in literature. Last, we highlight the necessity of a comprehensive risk-related debate around the effects that come with the use of digital healthcare solutions.","Kaiser, Florian Klaus; Wiens, Marcus; Schultmann, Frank",Health Technol (Berl),,275

The aim of this study is to evaluate work and psychological impact of COVID-19 on Lombardy radiation therapy (RT) residents in the first 3 months of the outbreak (first lockdown). METHODS: An online questionnaire (22 multiple choice questions) via Microsoft Forms was administered on 30 May 2020 to RT residents. RESULTS: Nineteen Lombardy RT residents responded to the survey. Nineteen percent of residents underwent a nasal swab and 11% were quarantined. Seventeen residents (89%) reported an increase in workload. Twelve residents (63%) did not find any difference in terms of work distress; worsening was highlighted in 5 cases (26%). The majority has never considered the possibility of stopping work due to excessive stress (89%). Almost all the residents experienced self- or relative-referred apprehension (95%). Ninety-five percent reported having missed extra-work social relationships. Most of the sample noted worsening sleep quality and difficulty concentrating (69%). No residents requested psychological support, even if provided by the hospital. CONCLUSION: Overall, the residents adapted to the new workplace scenario, although some health risks and well-being challenges have been reported. An extension of the survey to all Italian RT residents endorsed by Italian Association of Radiotherapy and Clinical Oncology ""Young AIRO"" will allow an evaluation of COVID-19 impact on a national level.

As a result, it has become important to understand the disease trends in order to mitigate its effects. The aim of this study is firstly to develop a prediction model for daily confirmed COVID-19 cases based on several covariates, and secondly, to select the best prediction model based on a subset of these covariates. METHODOLOGY: This study was conducted using daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 collected from the official Ministry of Health, Malaysia (MOH) and John Hopkins University websites. An Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model was fitted to the training data of observed cases from 22 January to 31 March 2020, and subsequently validated using data on cases from 1 April to 17 April 2020. The ARIMA model satisfactorily forecasted the daily confirmed COVID-19 cases from 18 April 2020 to 1 May 2020 (the testing phase). RESULTS: The ARIMA (0,1,0) model produced the best fit to the observed data with a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) value of 16.01 and a Bayes Information Criteria (BIC) value of 4.170. The forecasted values showed a downward trend of COVID-19 cases until 1 May 2020. Observed cases during the forecast period were accurately predicted and were placed within the prediction intervals generated by the fitted model. CONCLUSIONS: This study finds that ARIMA models with optimally selected covariates are useful tools for monitoring and predicting trends of COVID-19 cases in Malaysia.","Singh, Sarbhan; Murali Sundram, Bala; Rajendran, Kamesh; Boon Law, Kian; Aris, Tahir; Ibrahim, Hishamshah; Chandra Dass, Sarat; Singh Gill, Balvinder",J Infect Dev Ctries,,275

The disease can lead to serious problems, like pneumonia or even death especially among vulnerable people with existing health conditions. Its treatment and management require huge efforts from medical professionals often at the cost of their own health and life. Nutrition is the epicenter for the management of such diseases which works synergistically with the medical treatment for quick and better recovery. It has been associated with great human and economic toll and it is still not contained. Currently over two million people are affected and over 300,000 deaths globally. However, due to its newness and unfamiliarity, the understanding of this novel virus is still evolving. This viral infection poses numerous metabolic challenges to those severely affected and addressing them is a key to better outcomes. Medical nutritional therapy is thus among the mainstay of core components of comprehensive treatment measures for patients with COVID-19.

In this study, we conducted a global systematic literature review to summarize trends in the modelling techniques used for Covid-19 from January 1st, 2020 to October 30th, 2020. We further examined the reliability and correctness of predictions by comparing predicted and observed values for cumulative cases and deaths. From an initial 4311 peer-reviewed articles and preprints found with our defined keywords, 242 were fully analysed. Most studies were done on Asian (46.52%) and European (27.39%) countries. Most of them used compartmental models (namely SIR and SEIR) (46.1%) and statistical models (growth models and time series) (31.8%) while few used artificial intelligence (6.7%), Bayesian approach (4.7%), Network models (2.3%) and Agent-based models (1.3%). For the number of cumulative cases, the ratio of the predicted over the observed values and the ratio of the amplitude of confidence interval (CI) or credibility interval (CrI) of predictions and the central value were on average larger than 1 indicating cases of inaccurate and imprecise predictions, and large variation across predictions. There was no clear difference among models used for these two ratios. In 75% of predictions that provided CI or CrI, observed values fall within the 95% CI or CrI of the cumulative cases predicted. Only 3.7% of the studies predicted the cumulative number of deaths. For 70% of the predictions, the ratio of predicted over observed cumulative deaths was less or close to 1. Also, the Bayesian model made predictions closer to reality than classical statistical models, although these differences are only suggestive due to the small number of predictions within our dataset (9 in total). In addition, we found a significant negative correlation (rhoâ¯=â¯- 0.56, pâ¯=â¯0.021) between this ratio and the length (in days) of the period covered by the modelling, suggesting that the longer the period covered by the model the likely more accurate the estimates tend to be. Our findings suggest that while predictions made by the different models are useful to understand the pandemic course and guide policy-making, some were relatively accurate and precise while other not.","Gnanvi, Janyce; Salako, Kolawolé Valère; Kotanmi, Brezesky; Kakaï, Romain Glèlè",,,275

For the number of cumulative cases, the ratio of the predicted over the observed values and the ratio of the amplitude of confidence interval (CI) or credibility interval (CrI) of predictions and the central value were on average larger than 1 indicating cases of inaccurate and imprecise predictions, and large variation across predictions. There was no clear difference among models used for these two ratios. In 75% of predictions that provided CI or CrI, observed values fall within the 95% CI or CrI of the cumulative cases predicted. Only 3.7% of the studies predicted the cumulative number of deaths. For 70% of the predictions, the ratio of predicted over observed cumulative deaths was less or close to 1. Also, the Bayesian model made predictions closer to reality than classical statistical models, although these differences are only suggestive due to the small number of predictions within our dataset (9 in total). In addition, we found a significant negative correlation (rhoâ¯=â¯- 0.56, pâ¯=â¯0.021) between this ratio and the length (in days) of the period covered by the modelling, suggesting that the longer the period covered by the model the likely more accurate the estimates tend to be. Our findings suggest that while predictions made by the different models are useful to understand the pandemic course and guide policy-making, some were relatively accurate and precise while other not.","Gnanvi, Janyce; Salako, Kolawolé Valère; Kotanmi, Brezesky; Kakaï, Romain Glèlè",,,275

310475,"Interests, Motives, and Psychological Burdens in Times of Crisis and Lockdown: Google Trends Analysis to Inform Policy Makers",2021,"BACKGROUND: Elucidating the role of T cell responses in COVID-19 is of utmost importance to understand the clearance of SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: 30 hospitalized COVID-19 patients and 60 age- and gender-matched healthy controls (HC) participated in this study. We used two comprehensive 11-colour flow cytometric panels conforming to Good Laboratory Practice and approved for clinical diagnostics. FINDINGS: Absolute numbers of lymphocyte subsets were differentially decreased in COVID-19 patients according to clinical severity. In severe disease (SD) patients, all lymphocyte subsets were reduced, whilst in mild disease (MD) NK, NKT and Î³Î´ T cells were at the level of HC. Additionally, we provide evidence of T cell activation in MD but not SD, when compared to HC. Follow up samples revealed a marked increase in effector T cells and memory subsets in convalescing but not in non-convalescing patients. INTERPRETATION: Our data suggest that activation and expansion of innate and adaptive lymphocytes play a major role in COVID-19. Additionally, recovery is associated with formation of T cell memory as suggested by the missing formation of effector and central memory T cells in SD but not in MD. Understanding T cell-responses in the context of clinical severity might serve as foundation to overcome the lack of effective anti-viral immune response in severely affected COVID-19 patients and can offer prognostic value as biomarker for disease outcome and control.

315716,"Community-based screening and testing for Coronavirus in Cape Town, South Africa: Short report",2020,"WHO interim guidelines recommend offering extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) to eligible patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) related to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The number of patients with COVID-19 infection who might develop severe ARDS that is refractory to maximal medical management and require this level of support is currently unknown. Available evidence from similar patient populations suggests that carefully selected patients with severe ARDS who do not benefit from conventional treatment might be successfully supported with venovenous ECMO. The need for ECMO is relatively low and its use is mostly restricted to specialised centres globally. Providing complex therapies such as ECMO during outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases has unique challenges. Careful planning, judicious resource allocation, and training of personnel to provide complex therapeutic interventions while adhering to strict infection control measures are all crucial components of an ECMO action plan. ECMO can be initiated in specialist centres, or patients can receive ECMO during transportation from a centre that is not specialised for this procedure to an expert ECMO centre. Ensuring that systems enable safe and coordinated movement of critically ill patients, staff, and equipment is important to improve ECMO access. ECMO preparedness for the COVID-19 pandemic is important in view of the high transmission rate of the virus and respiratory-related mortality.","Ramanathan, Kollengode; Antognini, David; Combes, Alain; Paden, Matthew; Zakhary, Bishoy; Ogino, Mark; MacLaren, Graeme; Brodie, Daniel; Shekar, Kiran",Lancet Respir Med,,275

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, observational, descriptive study of consecutive patients admitted to the ICU due to severe respiratory symptoms secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection between 1 April and 1 June 2020. RESULTS: We included 30 patients with neurological symptoms; 21 were men (72.40%), and mean age (standard deviation [SD]) was 57.41 years (11.61). The mean duration of ICU stay was 18.83 days (14.33). The neurological conditions recorded were acute confusional syndrome in 28 patients (93.33%), neuromuscular disease in 15 (50%), headache in 5 (16.66%), cerebrovascular disease in 4 (13.33%), and encephalopathies/encephalitis in 4 (13.33%). CSF analysis results were normal in 6 patients (20%). Brain MRI or head CT showed alterations in 20 patients (66.6%). EEG was performed in all patients (100%), with 8 (26.66%) showing abnormal findings. In 5 of the 15 patients with clinical myopathy, diagnosis was confirmed with electroneuromyography. We found a correlation between older age and duration of ICU stay (P=.002; 95%CI: 4.032-6.022; OR: 3,594). CONCLUSIONS: Severe COVID-19 mainly affects men, as observed in other series. Half of our patients presented acute myopathy, and almost all patients left the ICU with acute confusional syndrome, which fully resolved; no correlation was found with EEG or neuroimaging findings. Older age is associated with longer ICU stay.","Abenza-Abildúa, M J; Ramírez-Prieto, M T; Moreno-Zabaleta, R; Arenas-Valls, N; Salvador-Maya, M A; Algarra-Lucas, C; Rojo Moreno-Arrones, B; Sánchez-Cordón, B; Ojeda-Ruíz de Luna, J; Jimeno-Montero, C; Navacerrada-Barrero, F J; Borrue-Fernández, C; Malmierca-Corral, E; Ruíz-Seco, P; González-Ruano, P; Palmí-Cortés, I; Fernández-Travieso, J; Mata-Álvarez de Santullano, M; Almarcha-Menargues, M L; Gutierrez-Gutierrez, G; Palacios-Castaño, J A; Alonso-Esteban, R; Gonzalo-García, N; Pérez-López, C","Neurologia (Barc., Ed. impr.)",,275

325004,Bots and Misinformation Spread on Social Media: Implications for COVID-19,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can present as a range of symptoms, from mild to critical; lower pulmonary involvement, including pneumonia, is often associated with severe and critical cases. Understanding the baseline characteristics of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 illness is essential for effectively targeting clinical care and allocating resources. This study aimed to describe baseline demographics and clinical characteristics of US patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and pulmonary involvement. METHODS: US patients with COVID-19 and pulmonary involvement during an inpatient admission from December 1, 2019, to May 20, 2020, were identified using the IBM Explorys® electronic health records database. Baseline (up to 12 months prior to first COVID-19 hospitalization) demographics and clinical characteristics and preadmission (14 days to 1 day prior to admission) pulmonary diagnoses were assessed. Patients were stratified by sex, age, race, and geographic region. RESULTS: Overall, 3471 US patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and pulmonary involvement were included. The mean (SD) age was 63.5 (16.3) years; 51.2% of patients were female, 55.0% African American, 81.6% from the South, and 16.8% from the Midwest. The most common comorbidities included hypertension (27.7%), diabetes (17.3%), hyperlipidemia (16.3%), and obesity (9.7%). Cough (27.3%) and dyspnea (15.2%) were the most common preadmission pulmonary symptoms. African American patients were younger (mean [SD], 62.5 [15.4] vs. 67.8 [6.2]) with higher mean (SD) body mass index (33.66 [9.46] vs. 30.42 [7.86]) and prevalence of diabetes (19.8% vs. 16.7%) and lower prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (5.6% vs. 8.2%) and smoking/tobacco use (28.1% vs. 37.2%) than White patients. CONCLUSIONS: Among US patients primarily from the South and Midwest hospitalized with COVID-19 and pulmonary involvement, the most common comorbidities were hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and obesity. Differences observed between African American and White patients should be considered in the context of the complex factors underlying racial disparities in COVID-19.","Best, Jennie H; Mohan, Shalini V; Kong, Amanda M; Patel, Krish; Pagel, John M; Ivanov, Boris; Brawley, Otis W; Jariwala-Parikh, Krutika; Zazzali, James L; Pauk, John",Adv Ther,,275

Specifically, experimental fidelity and error are observed not to be properly anti correlated, i.e., there are instances where a class of experiments with higher fidelity yields a greater error in the payoff. Further, we find that the classical strategy will always outperform the quantum strategy if corruption is higher than half.","Kairon, Pranav; Thapliyal, Kishore; Srikanth, R.; Pathak, Anirban",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.04533v1.pdf,275
328530,"Epidemiology and factors associated with diarrhoea among children under five years of age in the Engela District in the Ohangwena Region, Namibia",2020,"The exact transmission route of many respiratory infectious diseases remains a subject for debate to date. The relative contribution ratio of each transmission route is largely undetermined, which is affected by environmental conditions, human behaviour, the host and the microorganism. In this study, a detailed mathematical model is developed to investigate the relative contributions of different transmission routes to a multi-route transmitted respiratory infection. The following transmission routes are considered: long-range airborne transmission, short-range airborne transmission, direction inhalation of medium droplets or droplet nuclei, direct deposition of droplets of all sizes, direct and indirect contact route. It is illustrated that all transmission routes can dominate the total transmission risk under different scenarios. Influential parameters considered include the dose-response rate of different routes, droplet governing size that determines pathogen content in droplets, exposure distance, and pathogen dose transported to the hand of infector. Our multi-route transmission model provided a comprehensive but straightforward method to evaluate the probability of respiratory diseases transmission via different routes. It also established a basis for predicting the impact of individual-level intervention methods such as increasing close-contact distance and wearing protective masks.","Gao, Caroline X; Li, Yuguo; Wei, Jianjian; Cotton, Sue; Hamilton, Matthew; Wang, Lei; Cowling, Benjamin J",Sci Total Environ,,275

Albeit there are no specific trials nor subgroup analysis showing the effect of COVID-19 therapies in patients with diabetes, selected features of this disease and the side effects associated with certain drugs require a proper knowledge to optimize the pharmacological therapy of patients with diabetes and COVID-19. While chronic anti-hypertensive and glucose-lowering therapies should not be discontinued nor preferred for preventive purposes, the low-grade pro-inflammatory, the thrombosis-prone status of diabetes, the role of acute hyperglycaemia in promoting adverse outcomes in patients admitted to ICU, and the observed increased mortality in patients with poor long-term glycaemic control delineate a delicate balance in case of severe forms of COVID-19. Here, we briefly summarized some of the key pharmacological issues linked to the management of patients with diabetes and COVID-19, in order to provide indications to minimize the deleterious effects of the concomitant presentation of these diseases and to use the existing pharmacological options in an appropriate manner.","Ceriello, Antonio; Prattichizzo, Francesco",J Diabetes Complications,,275

In order to contain the spread of the virus, the Italian Government imposed home confinement to the entire population for almost two months. The present study is the first large-scale longitudinal report of the sleep and mental health changes during the prolonged lockdown due to the COVID-19 outbreak. We focused on the gendered vulnerability in a sample of the Italian population since cross-sectional research identified women to be more at-risk than men during this unprecedented situation. 2701 individuals (mean ageâ¯±â¯standard deviation, 32.37â¯±â¯11.62; range, 18-82) participated in a web-based longitudinal survey consisting of two measurements. Participants were first-time recruited on social networks and via telephone messages through a snowball sampling and tested during the third week of the lockdown period. Subsequently, a follow-up evaluation was carried out during the seventh week of lockdown. The survey assessed perceived stress, sleep quality, insomnia and depression symptoms, and anxiety, using the following questionnaires: the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, the Insomnia Severity Index, the Beck Depression Inventory-second edition, and the State-Anxiety Inventory. Women showed the worst condition for all the examined dimensions in both the assessments. Nevertheless, at the follow-up women reported a reduction in perceived stress, insomnia and depression severity symptoms, and anxiety. On the other hand, male participants showed a worsening of perceived stress, sleep quality, and insomnia symptoms. Consequently, the gender prevalence gap of clinical conditions such as insomnia and depression was largely reduced under lockdown. Our investigation pointed to a different time course of sleep and mental health between genders during the home confinement period. Women seemed to show greater long-term resilience during the lockdown. Meanwhile, the male gender emerges as the most vulnerable category to the extension of the restraining measures. Our results suggest that there is no ""weaker gender"" after a prolonged lockdown. Indeed, the Italian population transversely presented signs of psychological suffering and significant sleep disturbances after the protracted and stressful lockdown period due to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Salfi, Federico; Lauriola, Marco; Amicucci, Giulia; Corigliano, Domenico; Viselli, Lorenzo; Tempesta, Daniela; Ferrara, Michele",Neurobiol Stress,,275

Previous means of acquiring this information in the examination room have been insufficient in preventing disease spread. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to demonstrate the deployment of an automatic system to triage outpatients over the internet. METHODS: An automatic system was incorporated in the existing web-based appointment system of the hospital and deployed along with its on-site counterpart. Automatic queries to the virtual private network travel and contact history database with each patient's national ID number were made for each attempt to acquire the patient's travel and contact histories. Patients with relevant histories were denied registration or entry. Text messages were sent to patients without a relevant history for an expedited route of entry if applicable. RESULTS: A total of 127,857 visits were recorded. Among all visits, 91,195 were registered on the internet. In total, 71,816 of them generated text messages for an expedited route of entry. Furthermore, 65 patients had relevant histories, as revealed by the virtual private network database, and were denied registration or entry. CONCLUSIONS: An automatic triage system to acquire outpatients' relevant travel and contact histories was deployed rapidly in one of the largest academic medical centers in Taiwan. The updated system successfully denied patients with relevant travel or contact histories entry to the hospital, thus preventing long lines outside the hospital. Further efforts could be made to integrate the system with the electronic medical record system.","Lu, Ding-Heng; Hsu, Chia-An; Yuan, Eunice J; Fen, Jun-Jeng; Lee, Chung-Yuan; Ming, Jin-Lain; Chen, Tzeng-Ji; Lee, Wui-Chiang; Chen, Shih-Ann",JMIR Med Inform,,275

The present article emphasizes novel resource development on its genome structure, evolution, therapeutic targets, drug designing, and drug repurposing strategies. Genome organization, the function of coding genes, origin, and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 is described in detail. Genomic insights into understanding the structure-function relationships of drug targets including spike, main protease, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of SARS-CoV-2 are discussed intensively. Several molecular docking and systems pharmacology approaches have been investigated some promising antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2 based on its genomic characteristics, pathogenesis mechanism, and host specificity. Perhaps, the present genomic insights of this virus will provide a lead to the researchers to design or repurpose of antiviral drugs soon and future directions to control the spread of COVID-19.","Chellapandi, P; Saranya, S",Med Chem Res,,275
355114,"Home delivery of medication during Coronavirus disease 2019, Cape Town, South Africa: Short report",2020,"Since the first case of COVID-19 reported in late December of 2019 in Wuhan, China, the SARS-CoV-2 virus has caused approximately 20 million infections and 732 thousand deaths around the world by 11 August 2020. Although the pathogen generally infects the respiratory system, whether it is present in the bloodstream and whether it poses a threat to the blood supply during the period of the outbreak is of serious public concern. In this study, we used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to screen total antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in 2199 blood donors, who had donated blood at the Guangzhou Blood Center during the epidemic. The Ig-reactive samples were further characterized for IgA, IgG, and IgM subtypes by ELISA and viral nucleic acid by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Among the 2199 plasma samples, seven were reactive under total antibodies' screening. Further testing revealed that none of them had detectable viral nucleic acid or IgM antibody, but two samples contained IgA and IgG. The IgG antibody titers of both positive samples were 1:16 and 1:4, respectively. Our results indicated a low prevalence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection in our blood donors, as none of the tests were positive for viral nucleic acid and only 2 out of 2199 (0.09%) of samples were positive for IgG and IgA. There would be a limited necessity for the implementation of such testing in blood screening in a COVID-19 low-risk area.","Xu, Ru; Huang, Jieting; Duan, Chaohui; Liao, Qiao; Shan, Zhengang; Wang, Min; Rong, Xia; Li, Chengyao; Fu, Yongshui; Wang, Hao",J Med Virol,,275

360215,Development of a Resource Guide to Support the Engagement of Mental Health Providers and Patients With Digital Health Tools: Multimethod Study,2021,"BACKGROUND: This survey was focused on the provision of neurointerventional services, the current practices of managing patients under COVID-19 conditions, and the expectations for the future. METHODS: Invitations for this survey were sent out as a collaborative effort of the European Society of Minimally Invasive Neurological Therapy (ESMINT), the Society of NeuroInterventional Surgery (SNIS), the Sociedad Iberolatinoamericana de Neuroradiologia Diagnostica y Terapeutica (SILAN), the Society of Vascular and Interventional Neurology (SVIN), and the World Federation of Interventional and Therapeutic Neuroradiology (WFITN). RESULTS: Overall, 475 participants from 61 countries responded (six from Africa (1%), 81 from Asia (17%), 156 from Europe (33%), 53 from Latin America (11%), and 172 from North America (11%)). The majority of participants (96%) reported being able to provide emergency services, though 26% of these reported limited resources. A decrease in emergency procedures was reported by 69% of participants (52% in ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, 11% ischemic, and 6% hemorrhagic stroke alone). Only 4% reported an increase in emergency cases. The emerging need for social distancing and the rapid adoption of remote communication was reflected in the interest in establishing case discussion forums (43%), general online forums (37%), and access to angio video streaming for live mentoring and support (33%). CONCLUSION: Neurointerventional emergency services are available in almost all centers, while the number of emergency patients is markedly decreased. Half of the participants have abandoned neurointerventions in non-emergent situations. There are considerable variations in the management of neurointerventions and in the expectations for the future.","Fiehler, Jens; Brouwer, Patrick; Díaz, Carlos; Hirsch, Joshua A; Kulcsar, Zsolt; Liebeskind, David; Linfante, Italo; Lylyk, Pedro; Mack, William J; Milburn, James; Nogueira, Raul; Orbach, Darren B; Pumar, José Manuel Manuel; Tanaka, Michihiro; Taylor, Allan",J Neurointerv Surg,,275
360216,Development of a Resource Guide to Support the Engagement of Mental Health Providers and Patients With Digital Health Tools: Multimethod Study,2021,"BACKGROUND: Health care workers (HCWs) have been engaged in fighting dangerous epidemics for hundreds of years, more recently in severe acute respiratory syndrome, H1N1, Middle East respiratory syndrome, and now coronavirus disease 2019. A consistent feature of epidemic disease results is that health care systems and HCWs are placed under immense strain. METHODS: A focused narrative review was conducted using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines to examine the main concerns and anxieties faced by HCWs during recent epidemics and to determine the supports deemed most important to those HCWs to keep them at the frontline. PubMed, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library were searched in March 2020 using terms ""Healthcare"" OR ""Medical"" AND ""Staff"" OR ""Workers"" OR ""Front line"" AND ""Concerns"" OR ""Anxiety"" OR ""Stress"" AND ""Pandemic"" Or ""Epidemic."" RESULTS: Twenty-five studies that reported the concerns and expectations of an estimated 13,793 HCWs in 10 countries (Canada, China, Greece, Hong Kong, Japan, Liberia, Netherlands, Saudi Arabia, Singapore and Taiwan) during pandemic situations were identified. Health care workers identified personal and family safety, appreciation, and the provision of personal protective equipment and adequate rest as primary concerns. Informal psychological supports were favored over formal employment-based group interventions. DISCUSSION: Despite being hailed by the media as heroes, HCWs face social stigmatization and experienced high levels of anxiety and fear regarding personal safety and the health of their colleagues and family. Health care workers are more likely to seek peer-to-peer psychological support but also benefit from knowing that formal psychological supports are available to them.","Duffy, Caoimhe C; Bass, Gary A; Fitzpatrick, Gerry; Doherty, Eva M",J. patient saf,,275

380121,COVID-19 risk management: A mobile application to notify alerts and provide real-time covid-19 updates,2021,"This review describes the evidence for the potential benefit of Vitamin D supplementation in people with respiratory diseases who may have a higher susceptibility to Covid-19 infection and its consequences. Clinical evidence indicates that vitamin D may reduce the risk of both upper and lower respiratory tract infections and offers benefit particularly in people with Vitamin D deficiency. Some evidence exists for a higher incidence of active TB in patients who are deficient in vitamin D. An association between low levels of 25(OH)D (the active form of vitamin D) and COVID-19 severity of illness and mortality has also been reported. In addition, low 25(OH)D levels are associated with poor outcomes in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). The cytokine storm experienced in severe COVID-19 infections results from excessive release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Due to its immunomodulatory effects, adequate Vitamin D levels may cause a decrease in the pro-inflammatory cytokines and an increase in the anti-inflammatory cytokines during Covid-19 infections. Vitamin D deficiency was found in 82.2% of hospitalized COVID-19 cases and 47.2% of population-based controls (p<0.0001). The available evidence warrants an evaluation of Vitamin D supplementation in susceptible populations with respiratory diseases such as TB, and particularly in those who are deficient in Vitamin D. This may mitigate against serious complications of Covid-19 infections or reduce the impact of ARDS in those who have been infected.","Chetty, Vasudevan V; Chetty, Manoranjenni",Clinical and translational science (Online),,275

To date, no work has assessed how this guidance differs across governments. OBJECTIVE: This study seeks to contribute to a rational and consistent global response to infectious disease by determining how guidelines differ across nations and regions. METHODS: A content analysis of health agency mask guidelines on agency websites was performed in late March 2020 among 25 countries and regions with large numbers of COVID-19 cases. Countries and regions were assigned across the coding team by language proficiency, with Google Translate used as needed. When available, both the original and English language version of guidance were reviewed. RESULTS: All examined countries and regions had some form of guidance online, although detail and clarity differed. Although 9 countries and regions recommended surgical, medical, or unspecified masks in public and poorly ventilated places, 16 recommended against people wearing masks in public. There were 2 countries that explicitly recommended against fabric masks. In addition, 12 failed to outline the minimum basic World Health Organization guidance for masks. CONCLUSIONS: Online guidelines for face mask use to prevent COVID-19 in the general public are currently inconsistent across nations and regions, and have been changing often. Efforts to create greater standardization and clarity should be explored in light of the status of COVID-19 as a global pandemic.","Laestadius, Linnea; Wang, Yang; Ben Taleb, Ziyad; Kalan, Mohammad Ebrahimi; Cho, Young; Manganello, Jennifer",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,275

The migration of infection carriers from certain foci inherent in some countries is considered. The one-dimensional model is applied to three countries: Russia, Italy, and Chile. Both their geographical location and their particular shape stretching in the direction from the centers of infection (Moscow, Lombardy, and Santiago, respectively) make it possible to use such an approximation. The dynamic density of the infected is studied. Two parameters of the model are derived from known data. The first is the value of the average spreading rate associated with the transfer of infected persons in transport vehicles. The second is the frequency of the decrease in numbers of the infected as they move around the country, associated with the arrival of passengers at their destination. An analytical solution is obtained. Simple numerical methods are also used to perform a series of calculations.

In the present study, atmospheric zinc (Zn) emissions from eight CFPPs with different kinds of boilers and air pollution control devices (APCDs) in Guizhou Province, Southwest China, were investigated as well as the partitioning of this metal among boilers and APCDs. During the investigation of a CFPP, samples were taken of input and output materials during the same period. Our results give a Zn content of 32-165 mg kg-1 for feed coal, 52-237 mg kg-1 for bottom ash, 108-725 mg kg-1 for fly ash, 1.2-6.0 mg kg-1 for limestone, 1.6-7.3 mg kg-1 for gypsum, and 1.39-7.06 µg Nm-3 for stack gas. Most of the zinc content in the feed coal goes with the flue gas after combustion and amounts to 94.2-96.1% and 60.5-78.1% for pulverized coal-fired boilers (PC) and circulating fluidized bed boilers (CFB), respectively. Based on input Zn, a larger share (80.8-96.4%) ends up the captured fly ash of PC boilers than the case of CFB boilers (66.1-73.6%). In turn, a minor portion is captured into the flue gas desulfurization gypsum, while we found a maximum of 0.05 is emitted into the atmosphere. The atmospheric emission factors (EMFs) of Zn for the eight CFPPs are 7.55-57.22 mg ton-1 coal, 4.17-22.75 µg (kWh)-1, or 0.39-2.36 g TJ-1 using different benchmarks. Overall, the calculated emission factors here are distinctively low with the upgrading of APCDs in recent years. An estimation of 1276 ± 1047 kg year-1 (range: 498-3777 kg year-1) of Zn is emitted into the atmosphere from the CFPPs of Guizhou Province in 2017 by coupling the EMFs obtained from this study and the coal consumption by this category of power plants.","Zhou, Xian; Feng, Xinbin; Bi, Xiangyang; Li, Xinyu; Wang, Qingfeng; Li, Shan; He, Tianrong; Li, Zhonggen",,,275

426432,"Creating COVID-19 Stigma by Referencing the Novel Coronavirus as the ""Chinese virus"" on Twitter: Quantitative Analysis of Social Media Data",2020,"PURPOSE: Colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence rates are increasing among individuals < 50 years of age (early-onset CRC) globally with causes unknown. Racial/ethnic disparities in early-onset CRC have also grown more pronounced, because Black individuals have higher early-onset CRC incidence and poorer survival compared with White individuals. We describe the prevalence and burden of early-onset CRC among Africans in Nigeria and African Americans (AAs) in the United States. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We identified Black individuals diagnosed with a first primary CRC ages 18 to 49 years between 1989 and 2017 at Ahmadu Bello University Teaching Hospital in Zaria, Nigeria (Nigerians), and in the United States (AAs) using the National Institutes of Health/National Cancer Institute's SEER program of cancer registries. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to investigate clinical and demographic differences between Nigerians and AAs with early-onset CRC, adjusted for age, sex, tumor site, and histology. RESULTS: A total of 5,019 Black individuals were diagnosed with early-onset CRC over the study period (379 Nigerians; 4,640 AAs). Overall, approximately one third of young Black patients were diagnosed with rectal tumors (35.8%). Nigerian individuals with early-onset CRC were eight-fold more likely to be diagnosed with rectal tumors (odds ratio [OR], 8.14; 95% CI, 6.23 to 10.62; P < .0001) and more likely to be diagnosed at younger ages (OR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.86 to 0.89; P < .0001) compared with young African Americans in adjusted models. CONCLUSION: Compared with AA individuals diagnosed with early-onset CRC, Nigerian individuals harbor distinct features of early-onset CRC. Additional investigation of the histopathologic and biologic heterogeneity of early-onset CRCs among Black individuals is critical for understanding racial disparities in susceptibility and outcomes, which may have implications for tailored early-onset CRC prevention, detection, and treatment strategies.","Holowatyj, Andreana N; Maude, Aishatu Suleiman; Musa, Halimatu Sadiya; Adamu, Ahmed; Ibrahim, Sani; Abdullahi, Adamu; Manko, Muhammad; Aminu, Sirajo Mohammed; Mohammed, Abdullahi; Idoko, John; Ukwenya, Yahaya; Carpten, John; Chandler, Paulette D; Hampel, Heather; Faruk, Mohammed",JCO Glob Oncol,,275

COVID-19 is today the leading cause of death from viral infections in the world. It is known that many elements play important roles in viral infections, both in virus survival, and in the activation of the host's immune system, which depends on the presence of micronutrients to maintain the integrity of its functions. In this sense, the metallome can be an important object of study for understanding viral infections. Therefore, this work presents an overview of the role of trace elements in the immune system and the state of the art in metallomics, highlighting the challenges found in studies focusing on viral infections.","de Jesus, Jemmyson Romário; de Araújo Andrade, Tatianny",Metallomics (Print),,275

Pneumonia as an expression of COVID-19 is responsible for the most part of morbidity and mortality. Lung ultrasound can provide valuable information about the diagnosis of a COVID-19 pneumonia in daily practice. A normal ultrasound excludes COVID-19 pneumonia. Conversely, finding abnormalities matching with a COVID-19 pneumonia can be useful for isolation policy. Follow up lung ultrasound visualizes the development of the pneumonia and a possible alternative diagnosis can thereby be determined in the event of a deviating clinical course.","Assman, N.

We aimed to investigate the effect of maternal exposure to tobacco smoke on wheeze/asthma development at 1 year of age in her offspring using data from the nationwide birth cohort study in Japan. METHODS: Pregnant women who lived in the 15 designated regional centers throughout Japan were recruited. We obtained information about maternal smoking or secondhand smoke status and wheeze/asthma development in the offspring from a self-administered questionnaire. RESULTS: We analyzed 90,210 singleton births. Current maternal smoking during pregnancy increased the risks of wheeze/asthma in the offspring compared with no maternal smoking (wheeze: 1-10 cigarettes/day: adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.436, 95% CI 1.270-1.624; â§11 cigarettes/day: aOR 1.669, 95% CI 1.341-2.078; asthma: 1-10 cigarettes/day: aOR 1.389, 95% CI 1.087-1.774; â§11 cigarettes/day: aOR 1.565, 95% CI 1.045-2.344). Daily maternal exposure to secondhand smoke during pregnancy also increased the risks of wheeze/asthma in her offspring compared with no secondhand smoke exposure (wheeze: aOR 1.166, 95% CI 1.083-1.256; asthma: aOR 1.258, 95% CI 1.075-1.473). The combination of current maternal smoking during pregnancy and maternal history of allergy increased the risks of wheeze/asthma in her offspring (wheeze: aOR 2.007, 95% CI 1.739-2.317; asthma: aOR 1.995, 95% CI 1.528-2.605).

METHODS: Fifty T1D patients undergoing continuous/flash glucose monitoring were recruited. The study's primary outcome was the change of time in range (TIR) from before to lockdown period. Three time-point comparisons of TIR, mean glucose levels (MG), estimated (e)HbA1c, time above (TAR) and below range (TBR), moderate/severe hypoglycemic events between pre-lockdown, lockdown and post-lockdown period were also performed. Information on lockdown-associated perceived stress, changes of work status and physical activity were recorded. RESULTS: TIR significantly decreased (75(63-84)% vs.69(50-76)%,p < 0.001) whereas MG (154 ± 15 mg/dl vs.165 ± 25 mg/dl, p = 0.027) and eHbA1c (7.3(6.6-7.8)%vs.7.5(6.7-8.2)%,p = 0.031) increased from pre- to lockdown period; overall glucose control significantly improved when restriction ended. Lockdown-associated work loss/suspension independently predicted impaired TIR after adjustment for potential confounders (Standardizedß: -0.29; 95%C&#921;: -18.7 to -2.25;p = 0.01). Greater TAR, TBR and hypoglycemic events were also reported during the lockdown. CONCLUSION: In T1D Italian individuals, blood glucose control significantly worsened during the COVID-19 lockdown; work instability and related issues represented the main determinant of impaired glucose variability in this population.","Barchetta, Ilaria; Cimini, Flavia Agata; Bertoccini, Laura; Ceccarelli, Valentina; Spaccarotella, Michele; Baroni, Marco Giorgio; Cavallo, Maria Gisella",Diabetes Res Clin Pract,,275

The need for constant monitoring of diseases activity and prompt adjustment of therapy have been balanced with the risk of contagion related to face-to-face consultations. Therefore, digital health initiatives have been pursued for safety reasons as vicarious instruments to avoid overcrowding of the IBD clinics. However, concerns and skepticism about the feasibility of digital health and telemedicine modalities limited their uptake in clinical practice in the pre-pandemic period.Areas covered: We conducted a literature overview on the current state of the art and the potential future benefits deriving from the integration of telemedicine systems, home-based laboratory tests, and self-administered drugs into IBD daily practice.Expert opinion: Digital health and telemedicine approaches at distance have been experimented as effective tools to avoid overcrowding of clinics and reduce risk from SARS-CoV2 exposure. Home-based point of care testing, such as fecal calprotectin and dried blood samples, might represent an effective method of remote monitoring of patients particularly when in-person visits are precluded. High expectations are placed on the use of self-administered advanced therapies, such as new subcutaneous formulation of biologics.","Solitano, Virginia; Alfarone, Ludovico; D039,; Amico, Ferdinando; Peyrin-Biroulet, Laurent; Danese, Silvio",Expert Opin Biol Ther,,275

Researchers reported that foods rich in carbohydrates could generate high amounts of acrylamide at high temperatures. In recent years, hydrocolloids are applied to reduce acrylamide in thermally processed foods and the effect has been well proved. The present work was to investigate the effect of sodium alginate as the coating agent on acrylamide formation in fried potato chips by a Box-Behnken design. The optimized processing conditions were: sodium alginate at the concentration of 1.34%, frying time at 4.38 min, and frying temperature at 179 °C. The corresponding inhibition rate of acrylamide was 76.59%. Compared to the control group, the oil absorption of coating chips decreased significantly, whereas the addition of sodium alginate did not affect the quality of potato chips. Scanning electron microscope analysis revealed that coating with sodium alginate could effectively prevent oil uptake, which might contribute to acrylamide mitigation. Overall, sodium alginate significantly mitigated acrylamide formation in fried potato chips. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Sodium alginate could significantly reduce acrylamide formation in fried potato chips systems. Sodium alginate may therefore be a new mitigation strategy for acrylamide formation in commercial fried foods without prejudice to main quality properties valued by consumers.","Liu, Hui; Li, Xuenan; Yuan, Yuan",J. food sci,,275

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Interfering with the expression level of ECT2 in human squamous cell carcinomas KYSE140 and EC9706 cell lines, the changes of KYSE140 and EC9706 cell proliferation, invasion, and migration were measured using the CCK-8 method, transwell test, and scratch test, respectively. The effects of ECT2 on the Ras homolog gene family, member A-extracellular regulated protein kinases (RhoA-ERK) signaling pathway were also observed. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the proliferation, migration, and invasion ability of EC9706 and KYSE140 cells after ECT2 knockout were significantly reduced (p <0.05). The knockdown of ECT2 expression in ESCC cell lines suppressed the activation of RhoA-ERK signaling pathway and protein expression of VEGF and MMP9. CONCLUSIONS: ECT2 could regulated the expression of VEGF and MMP9 to inhibit cells proliferation, invasion, migration and tumor development through RhoA-ERK signaling pathway. Therefore, ECT2 could be an available marker, and provide a new theoretical basis for the treatment of ESCC.","Sun, B-Y; Wei, Q-Q; Liu, C-X; Zhang, L; Luo, G; Li, T; Lü, M-H",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,,275

A 43-year-old man presented to our hospital with a complaint of fever, for which he was diagnosed with COVID-19 after a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and antiviral therapy with favipiravir and ciclesonide was started subsequently. The fever persisted for the first few days of treatment, but his respiratory status was stable, and he became asymptomatic and afebrile on day 9. Although the PCR tests remained positive, he met the updated discharge criteria of the World Health Organization (WHO) on day 12. However, his fever recurred, and his condition worsened on day 16. A chest X-ray showed a new opacity. It is likely that favipiravir and ciclesonide treatment probably did not completely eliminate the virus in the patient, and therefore the infection persisted. We added remdesivir from day 21, and the improvement was remarkable. He was discharged on day 29 after two consecutive PCR test results were negative. PCR tests are not mandatory for the updated WHO discharge criteria. However, even after antiviral therapy, COVID-19 patients with hematologic malignancies may have prolonged active infection with impaired viral excretion. Depending on the background disease and comorbidities, there may be some patient populations for whom it is not appropriate to simply comply with the current discharge criteria. Therefore, more emphasis may be needed on PCR examinations.","Fujii, Hiroyuki; Tsuji, Taisuke; Sugitani, Mio; Matsumoto, Yosuke; Yuba, Tatsuya; Tanaka, Shunya; Suga, Yoshifumi; Matsuyama, Aosa; Goda, Shiho; Omura, Ayaka; Shiotsu, Shinsuke; Takumi, Chieko; Ono, Seiko; Hiraoka, Noriya",Curr Probl Cancer,,275
522738,Global Reach of an Online COVID-19 Course in Multiple Languages on OpenWHO in the First Quarter of 2020: Analysis of Platform Use Data,2020,"Real-world complex systems often comprise many distinct types of elements as well as many more types of networked interactions between elements. When the relative abundances of types can be measured well, we further observe heavy-tailed categorical distributions for type frequencies. For the comparison of type frequency distributions of two systems or a system with itself at different time points in time -- a facet of allotaxonometry -- a great range of probability divergences are available. Here, we introduce and explore `probability-turbulence divergence', a tunable, straightforward, and interpretable instrument for comparing normalizable categorical frequency distributions. We model probability-turbulence divergence (PTD) after rank-turbulence divergence (RTD). While probability-turbulence divergence is more limited in application than rank-turbulence divergence, it is more sensitive to changes in type frequency. We build allotaxonographs to display probability turbulence, incorporating a way to visually accommodate zero probabilities for `exclusive types' which are types that appear in only one system. We explore comparisons of example distributions taken from literature, social media, and ecology. We show how probability-turbulence divergence either explicitly or functionally generalizes many existing kinds of distances and measures, including, as special cases, $L^{(p)}$ norms, the S{\o}rensen-Dice coefficient (the $F_1$ statistic), and the Hellinger distance. We discuss similarities with the generalized entropies of R{\'e}nyi and Tsallis, and the diversity indices (or Hill numbers) from ecology.

Such distress is associated with alterations in immune function, including an elevated risk of viral respiratory tract infections. In this light, the possible effects of Ayurveda, a traditional system of medicine promoted by the Indian government as an “immune booster”, are examined from the point of view of psychoneuroimmune mechanisms as well as the “meaning response” described by Moerman. It was found that many of the measures advocated in their guidelines could positively influence immunity either by direct effects on symptoms of depression or anxiety, or through their symbolic significance. Therefore, it is possible that such traditional practices could be beneficial both in terms of psychological quality of life, and in terms of moderating the risk of infection.","Rajkumar, Ravi Philip",Brain Behav Immun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32334064/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0889159120306371; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.04.056; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889159120306371?v=s5,275

This study focusses on the viewpoint of the orthopedic residents to the paradigm shift in clinical care as well as the academic activities. METHODS: An anonymous questionnaire was created in an online survey generator and was sent through e-mail to 227 orthopedic residents of seven tertiary care centres in North India. The questionnaire was divided into three sections, academic activity section, mental health section, and clinical activity section. There were a total of 44 single answer questions with answers according to the increasing difficulty at present situation compared to a previous time before the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: A total of 158 questionnaires were filled by 107 junior residents (67.7%) and 51 senior residents (32.3%). 49 residents (31%) were quarantined and three became positive for COVID-19. Although all of them knew about necessary precautions, personal protective equipment was difficult to avail at times. Increased difficulty in recruiting new patients for research (48.9%) and conducting prospective research (48.7%) was observed. The online-based learning process was reported to be easier (44.2%) by most of the residents. Routine clinical work in the operating room, out-patient department, and inpatient department was found to be difficult according to the majority of the residents along with the anxiety of contracting the infection. CONCLUSION: There are unique opportunities for improvement of residency programs during these times of uncertainty and the findings of this study can help the universities as well as program chairs to develop a robust program that can outlive this pandemic. The web-based learning process might prove to be useful and can be incorporated into the resident training program in the long term.

This paper demonstrates how the concept of technological exposure can be extended to generic needs of individuals, and further to the needs of populations of individuals and even as far as “existential threats” to humanity. Technological categories that incur high levels of population exposure are explored, and categories are described. A theoretical basis for reducing population exposure is developed from the basic concepts of technological exposure. Technological developments that potentially enable less centralised societies having lower levels of population exposure, are considered for practicality and effectiveness as are the factors that could allow and cause transition to a less technologically centralised model. Some conclusions regarding practicality, triggers, and issues arising from a decentralised society are considered and include the key conclusion that a higher level of decentralisation and exposure reduction is both desirable and possible.","Robertson, Lindsay J.",Futures,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0016328720300720; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016328720300720?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.futures.2020.102584; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32523162/,275

We set up a population-based study to assess whether individuals with SMD had a higher risk of death associated with a COVID-19 infection (COVID-19 associated death) than individuals without SMD. Methods: Exploratory analysis with a cross-sectional design in the framework of a population-based register study covering the entire Swedish population. The Swedish Board for Health and Welfare (Socialstyrelsen) provided anonymized tabulated summary data for further analysis. We compared numbers of COVID-19 associated death in individuals with SMD (cases) and without SMD (controls). We calculated the odds ratio (OR) for the whole sample and by age group and four comorbidities, namely diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, chronic lung disease. Results: The sample comprised of 7,923,859 individuals, 103,999 with SMD and 7,819,860 controls. There were 130 (0.1%) COVID-19 associated deaths in the SMD group and 4,945 (0.06%) in the control group, corresponding to an OR of 1.98 (CI 1.66-2.35; p < 0.001). The odds were 4-fold for the age groups between 60 and 79 years and 1.5-fold for cardiovascular diseases. Individuals with SMD without any of the risk factors under study had 3-fold odds of COVID-19 associated death. Conclusion: Our preliminary results identify individuals with SMD as a further group at increased risk of COVID-19 associated death. In regard to comorbidities, future studies should explore the potential confounding or mediation role in the relationship between SMD and COVID-19 associated deaths.","Maripuu, Martin; Bendix, Marie; Öhlund, Louise; Widerström, Micael; Werneke, Ursula",Front Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33488430/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.609579,275

This study aims to quantify the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the care of patients with cancer by comparing a period of 4 months after the outbreak began (2 March 2020) with an equal period from 2019. METHODS Cancer cases of the esophagus, stomach, colon and rectum, pancreas, lung, skin-melanoma, breast, cervix, prostate, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and leukemia from the Portuguese Oncology Institute of Porto, and diagnosed between 2 March and 1 July 2019 (before COVID-19) and 2020 (after COVID-19) were identified. Those with the first treatment outside the Portuguese Oncology Institute of Porto were excluded. Sociodemographic, clinical and treatment characteristics were obtained from the cancer registry database and clinical files. RESULTS The absolute number of new cancer cases decreased nearly 40% after the COVID-19 pandemic (from 1430 to 866). The largest decreases were observed for cervical (-74.3%) and prostate (-71.7%) cancers. Cases were more often diagnosed at more advanced stages in 2020 (P = 0.001), and the proportion of patients not starting any treatment until 1 July was just under 20% in 2019 and nearly 40% in 2020. The median times from symptoms onset, first medical exam and first appointment to diagnosis, and from diagnosis to first appointment, multidisciplinary tumor board meeting and first treatment were shorter after COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS There was a notable overall decrease in cancer diagnoses after COVID-19, with changes in the characteristics of incident cases.","Morais, Samantha; Antunes, Luís; Rodrigues, Jéssica; Fontes, Filipa; Bento, Maria José; Lunet, Nuno",European journal of cancer prevention : the official journal of the European Cancer Prevention Organisation,https://doi.org/10.1097/cej.0000000000000686; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34267109/,275

Employing confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), this study examined the factor structure of the DASS-21 and five shortened versions of the DASS-21 among psychiatric patients (N = 168) and the general public (N = 992) during the COVID-19 confinement period in Saudi Arabia. Multigroup CFA, Mann Whitney W test, Spearman’s correlation, and coefficient alpha were used to examine the shortened versions of the DASS-21 (DASS-13, DASS-12, DASS-9 (two versions), and DASS-8) for invariance across age and gender groups, discriminant validity, predictive validity, item coverage, and internal consistency, respectively. Compared with the DASS-21, all three-factor structures of the shortened versions expressed good fit, with the DASS-8 demonstrating the best fit and highest item loadings on the corresponding factors in both samples (χ(2)(16, 15) = 16.5, 67.0; p = 0.420, 0.001; CFI = 1.000, 0.998; TLI = 0.999, 0.997; RMSEA = 0.013, 0.059, SRMR = 0.0186, 0.0203). The DASS-8 expressed configural, metric, and scalar invariance across age and gender groups. Its internal consistency was comparable to other versions (α = 0.94). Strong positive correlations of the DASS-8 and its subscales with the DASS-21 and its subscales (r = 0.97 to 0.81) suggest adequate item coverage and good predictive validity of this version. The DASS-8 and its subscales distinguished the clinical sample from the general public at the same level of significance expressed by the DASS-21 and other shortened versions, supporting its discriminant validity. Neither the DASS-21 nor the shortened versions distinguished patients diagnosed with depression and anxiety from each other or from other psychiatric conditions. The DASS-8 represents a valid short version of the DASS-21, which may be useful in research and clinical practice for quick identification of individuals with potential psychopathologies. Diagnosing depression/anxiety disorders may be further confirmed in a next step by clinician-facilitated examinations. Brevity of the DASS-21 would save time and effort used for filling the questionnaire and support comprehensive assessments by allowing the inclusion of more measures on test batteries.","Ali, Amira Mohammed; Alkhamees, Abdulmajeed A.; Hori, Hiroaki; Kim, Yoshiharu; Kunugi, Hiroshi",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph181910142; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34639443/,275

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The number of on-site and telehealth visits (THV) for medical and surgical specialties were obtained from scheduling software. RESULTS: Total visits were most drastically limited in April 2020 to a low point of 3139; THV made up 28% of all visits. For head and neck surgery, THV made up 54% and 30% of visits in April and May, respectively. Other specialties, such as psychiatry and palliative care, had higher levels of THV. For most specialties, the rebound in June through September did not make up for visits lost during the outbreak, and fiscal year (FY) 2020 had a 9% loss from FY 2019 with 5786 fewer total annual visits across all specialties. CONCLUSIONS: While telemedicine was a helpful part of this cancer center's response to the initial COVID-19 surge, it was not able to replace the in-person services offered at the same center. The main strategy of physicians at this cancer center was to defer care, with telemedicine being an auxiliary response.","Moentmann, Michael R; Johnson, Jared; Chung, Michael T; Yoo, Olivia E; Lin, Ho-Sheng; Yoo, George H",J. surg. oncol,https://doi.org/10.1002/jso.26681; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34562269/,275

Since then PHM has been an active part of a global counter-hegemonic social movement. This study aimed to gain insights on social movement building, drawing on the successes and failures reported by activists over their experiences of working in the Health for All social movement to improve health, justice and equity. METHODS: Qualitative research methods were employed in this study to capture complex and historical narratives of individual activists, through semi-structured interviews and subsequent thematic analysis of transcripts. The research design and analysis were informed by social movement theory and literature on health activism as a pathway for social change. In this study we examine the semi-structured interviews of 15 health activists who are part of the PHM, with the aim of deriving lessons for strengthening movements for Health for All. RESULTS: This study locates the activists’ narratives within a socio-political analysis of the global trends of late modern individualism and capitalist neoliberalism. This highlights the challenges faced by civil society groups mobilising collective action and building social movements for Health for All. The study found that within the constraints of the neoliberal socio-political and economic conditions which have caused the rise in social and health inequities, this group of long-term health activists have been nurturing alternative approaches to structuring society and building collective agency to improve health. CONCLUSION: The practical long-term experiences of the PHM activists examined in this study contribute to a better understanding of the processes and motivations that lead to and sustain health activism, and the dilemmas, strategies, impacts and achievements of such activism.","Musolino, Connie; Baum, Fran; Freeman, Toby; Labonté, Ronald; Bodini, Chiara; Sanders, David",Int J Equity Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32631376/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12939-020-01232-1,275

We set-up a multicenter Italian collaboration (CORIST Project, ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT04318418) to retrospectively investigate the relationship between RAAS inhibitors and COVID-19 in-hospital mortality. We also carried out an updated meta-analysis on the relevant studies. Methods: We analyzed 4,069 unselected patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and hospitalized in 34 clinical centers in Italy from February 19, 2020 to May 23, 2020. The primary end-point in a time-to event analysis was in-hospital death, comparing patients who received angiotensin-converting–enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) or angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARB) with patients who did not. Articles for the meta-analysis were retrieved until July 13th, 2020 by searching in web-based libraries, and data were combined using the general variance-based method. Results: Out of 4,069 COVID-19 patients, 13.5% and 13.3% received ACE-I or ARB, respectively. Use of neither ACE-I nor ARB was associated with mortality (multivariable hazard ratio (HR) adjusted also for COVID-19 treatments: 0.96, 95% confidence interval 0.77-1.20 and HR=0.89, 0.67-1.19 for ACE-I and ARB, respectively). Findings were similar restricting the analysis to hypertensive (N=2,057) patients (HR=1.00, 0.78-1.26 and HR=0.88, 0.65-1.20) or when ACE-I or ARB were considered as a single group. Results from the meta-analysis (19 studies, 29,057 COVID-19 adult patients, 9,700 with hypertension) confirmed the absence of association. Conclusions: In this observational study and meta-analysis of the literature, ACE-I or ARB use was not associated with severity or in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients.","Di Castelnuovo, Augusto; Costanzo, Simona; Antinori, Andrea; Berselli, Nausicaa; Blandi, Lorenzo; Bonaccio, Marialaura; Cauda, Roberto; Gialluisi, Alessandro; Guaraldi, Giovanni; Menicanti, Lorenzo; Mennuni, Marco; Mussinelli, Roberta; My, Ilaria; Parruti, Giustino; Patti, Giuseppe; Perlini, Stefano; Santilli, Francesca; Signorelli, Carlo; Stefanini, Giulio G.; Vergori, Alessandra; Abete, Paolo; Ageno, Walter; Agostoni, Piergiuseppe; Aiello, Luca; Al Moghazi, Samir; Arboretti, Rosa; Aucella, Filippo; Barbieri, Greta; Barchitta, Martina; Bartoloni, Alessandro; Bonfanti, Paolo; Cacciatore, Francesco; Caiano, Lucia; Carrozzi, Laura; Cascio, Antonio; Castiglione, Giacomo; Cianfrone, Stefania; Ciccullo, Arturo; Cingolani, Antonella; Cipollone, Francesco; Colomba, Claudia; Colombo, Crizia; Cozzi, Ottavia; Crisetti, Annalisa; Crosta, Francesca; Danzi, Gian Battista; D'Ardes, Damiano; de Gaetano Donati, Katleen; Di Gennaro, Francesco; Di Tano, Giuseppe; D’Offizi, Gianpiero; Fusco, Francesco Maria; Gentile, Ivan; Graziani, Emauele; Guarnieri, Gabriella; Larizza, Giovanni; Leone, Armando; Lio, Veronica; Lucia, Mothanje Barbara; Maccagni, Gloria; Madaro, Ferruccio; Maitan, Stefano; Mancarella, Sandro; Manuele, Rosa; Mapelli, Massimo; Maragna, Riccardo; Marcucci, Rossella; Maresca, Giulio; Marongiu, Silvia; Marotta, Claudia; Marra, Lorenzo; Mastroianni, Franco; Mazzitelli, Maria; Mengozzi, Alessandro; Menichetti, Francesco; Meschiari, Marianna; Milic, Jovana; Minutolo, Filippo; Molena, Beatrice; Mussini, Cristina; Musso, Maria; Odone, Anna; Olivieri, Marco; Palimodde, Antonella; Pasi, Emanuela; Pesavento, Raffaele; Petri, Francesco; Pinchera, Biagio; Pivato, Carlo A.; Poletti, Venerino; Ravaglia, Claudia; Rossato, Marco; Rossi, Marianna; Sabena, Anna; Salinaro, Francesco; Sangiovanni, Vincenzo; Sanrocco, Carlo; Scoppettuolo, Giancarlo; Scorzolini, Laura; Sgariglia, Raffaella; Simeone, Paola Giustina; Trecarichi, Enrico Maria; Vettor, Roberto; Vianello, Andrea; Vinceti, Marco; Virano, Alexandra; Vocciante, Laura; Iacoviello, Licia; Caterina",Vascul Pharmacol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vph.2020.106805; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1537189120303104; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1537189120303104?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32992048/,275

Specific immunoglobulins (IgY) could be produced in egg yolk by immunizing hens with specific antigens. In the present study, we cloned the E. maxima gam56 gene, expressed the GST-GAM56 fusion protein and raised IgY to GST-GAM56 in hens. The anti-GST-GAM56 IgY antibody was isolated and used to treat chickens infected with E. maxima oocysts. Intramuscular injection of the antibodies provided minimal protection against parasite infection. However, oral dosing of the IgY 3 or 5 d after oocyst inoculation significantly improved body weight gain, reduced oocyst output and intestinal lesion score were reduced at 3 or 5 d after oocyst challenging, compared to the untreated control group. Our findings suggest that the IgY to gam56 could be an effective prophylactic or therapeutic agent against E. maxima infection in chickens and should have a practical application value.","DING, Jun; LIU, Qiao-rong; HAN, Jin-peng; QIAN, Wei-feng; LIU, Qun",Journal of Integrative Agriculture,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288948/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2095311912601762; https://doi.org/10.1016/s2095-3119(12)60176-2; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095311912601762,275
629681,Mining and Validating Social Media Data for COVID-19–Related Human Behaviors Between January and July 2020: Infodemiology Study,2021-05-25,"INTRODUCTION: Proposals for substantive reforms to the orthopaedic resident selection process are growing, given increasing applicant competitiveness, burgeoning inefficiencies and inequities of the current system, and impending transition of Step 1 to pass/fail. The COVID-19 pandemic has further catalyzed the need for reforms, offering unprecedented opportunities to pilot novel changes. However, a comprehensive collation of all proposed and implemented orthopaedic reforms is currently lacking. Thus, we aimed to characterize proposed orthopaedic-specific resident selection reforms in the context of reforms implemented by other specialties. METHODS: EMBASE, MEDLINE, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were searched for references proposing reforms to the orthopaedic resident selection process published from 2005 to 2020. An inductive approach to qualitative content analysis was used to categorize reforms. RESULTS: Twenty-six articles proposing 13 unique reforms to the orthopaedic resident selection process were identified. The most commonly proposed reforms included noncognitive assessments (n = 8), application caps (n = 7), standardized letters of recommendation (n = 5), program-specific supplemental applications (n = 5), creation of a centralized database of standardized program information (n = 4), use of a standardized applicant composite score (n = 4), and a moratorium on postinterview communication (n = 4). Importantly, nearly all of these reforms have also been proposed or implemented by other specialties. DISCUSSION: Numerous reforms to the orthopaedic resident selection process have been suggested over the past 15 years, several of which have been implemented on a program-specific basis, including noncognitive assessments, supplemental applications, and standardized letters of recommendation. Careful examination of applicant and program experiences and Match outcomes after these reforms is imperative to inform future directions.","London, Daniel A; Zastrow, Ryley K",J. Am. Acad. Orthop.

Translocation of tRNAs through the ribosome from aminoacyl (A) site to peptidyl (P) site, and from P-site to exit (E) site is catalysed in eukaryotes by the translocase elongation factor 2 (EF-2), and in prokaryotes by its homologue EF-G. During tRNA movement one or more “hybrid” states (A/P) is occupied, but molecular details of them and of the translocation process are limited. Here we show by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) that a population of mammalian ribosomes stalled at an mRNA pseudoknot structure contains structurally-distorted tRNAs in two different A/P hybrid states. In one (A/P’) the tRNA is in contact with the translocase EF-2 which induces it. In the other (A/P”) the translocase is absent. The existence of these alternative A/P intermediate states has relevance to our understanding of the mechanics and kinetics of translocation.","Flanagan, John F.; Namy, Olivier; Brierley, Ian; Gilbert, Robert J.

However, few methods except the Z-number considered the reliability of information. In this paper, we propose a multi-criterion decision-making method based on the Dempster-Shafer (DS) theory and generalized Z-numbers. To do so, inspired by the concept of hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set, we extend the Z-number to a generalized form which is more in line with human expression habits. Afterwards, we make a bridge between the knowledge of Z-numbers and the DS evidence theory to integrate Z-valuations.

The dramatic lifestyle changes and stressors associated with this pandemic pose a threat to mental health and have the potential to exacerbate risk factors for suicide. We used autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models to assess Google Trends data representing searches in the United States for 18 terms related to suicide and known suicide risk factors following the emergence of COVID-19. Although the relative proportion of Google searches for suicide-related queries was lower than predicted during the early pandemic period, searches for the following queries representative of financial difficulty were dramatically elevated: “I lost my job” (226%; 95%CI, 120%-333%), “laid off” (1164%; 95%CI, 395%-1932%), “unemployment” (1238%; 95%CI, 560%-1915%), and “furlough” (5717%; 95%CI, 2769%-8665%). Searches for the Disaster Distress Helpline, which was promoted as a source of help for those impacted by COVID-19, were also remarkably elevated (3021%; 95%CI, 873%-5169%). Google searches for other queries representative of help-seeking and general mental health concerns were moderately elevated. It appears that some indices of suicidality have fallen in the United States in this early stage of the pandemic, but that COVID-19 may have caused an increase in suicide risk factors that could yield long-term increases in suicidality and suicide rates.","Halford, Emily A.; Lake, Alison M.; Gould, Madelyn S.",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0236777; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32706835/,275
636625,Echo Chamber Effect in Rumor Rebuttal Discussions About COVID-19 in China: Social Media Content and Network Analysis Study,2021-03-25,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is the largest global event in recent times, with millions of infected people and hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide. Colombia has also been affected by the pandemic, including by the cancellation of medically necessary surgical procedures that were categorized as nonessential. The objective of this study was to show the results of the program implemented in two institutions in Bogotá, Colombia, in April 2020 to support the performance of elective essential and nonessential low- and medium-complexity orthopedic surgeries during the mitigation phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, which involved a presurgical clinical protocol without serological or molecular testing. METHODS: This was a multicenter, observational, retrospective, descriptive study of a cohort of patients who underwent elective orthopedic surgery at two institutions in the city of Bogota, Colombia, in April 2020. We implemented a preoperative clinical protocol that did not involve serological or molecular tests; the protocol consisted of a physical examination, a survey of symptoms and contact with confirmed or suspected cases, and presurgical isolation. We recorded the types of surgeries, the patients’ scores on the medically necessary, time-sensitive (MeNTs) scale, the presence of signs, symptoms, and mortality associated with COVID-19 developed after the operation. RESULTS: A total of 179 patients underwent orthopedic surgery. The average age was 47 years (Shapiro-Wilk, P = 0.021), and the range was between 18 and 81 years. There was a female predominance (61.5%). With regard to the types of surgeries, 86 (48%) were knee operations, 42 (23.5%) were hand surgeries, 34 (19%) were shoulder surgeries, and 17 (9.5%) were foot and ankle surgeries. The average MeNTs score was 44.6 points. During the 2 weeks after surgery, four patients were suspected of having COVID-19 because they developed at least two symptoms associated with the disease. The incidence of COVID-19 in the postoperative period was 2.3%. Two (1.1%) of these four patients visited an emergency department where RT-PCR tests were performed, and they tested negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). No patients died or were hospitalized for symptoms of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Through the implementation of a presurgical clinical protocol consisting of a physical examination; a clinical survey inquiring about signs, symptoms, and epidemiological contact with suspected or confirmed cases; and presurgical isolation but not involving the performance of molecular or serological diagnostic tests, positive results were obtained with regard to the performance of low- and medium-complexity elective orthopedic surgeries in an early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Failure to generate hepatitis B virus (HBV)-specific antibodies is well-known in patients with end-stage renal disease. However, whether and to what extent HBV-specific cellular immunity is altered in this population and how it influences humoral immunity is not clear. To address it, we analyzed HBV-reactive T cells and antibodies in hemodialysis patients post vaccination. 29 hemodialysis patients and 10 healthy controls were enrolled in a cross-sectional study. Using multiparameter flow cytometry, HBV-reactive T cells were analyzed and functionally dissected based on granzyme B, interferon-γ (IFN-γ), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-2 (IL-2), and IL-4 expression. Importantly, HBV-reactive CD4(+) T cells were detected not only in all patients with sufficient titers but also in 70% of non-responders. Furthermore, a correlation between the magnitude of HBV-reactive CD4(+) T cells and post-vaccination titers was observed. In summary, our data showed that HBV-reactive polyfunctional T cells were present in the majority of hemodialysis patients even if humoral immunity failed. Further studies are required to confirm their in vivo antiviral capacity. The ability to induce vaccine-reactive T cells paves new ways for improved vaccination and therapy protocols.","Awad, Gounwa; Roch, Toralf; Stervbo, Ulrik; Kaliszczyk, Sviatlana; Stittrich, Anna; Hörstrup, Jan; Cinkilic, Ocan; Appel, Heiner; Natrus, Larysa; Gayova, Ludmila; Seibert, Felix; Bauer, Frederic; Westhoff, Timm; Nienen, Mikalai; Babel, Nina",Mol Ther Methods Clin Dev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33898628/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.omtm.2021.03.012,275

Evidence on the safe extension of international normalized ratio (INR) testing frequency remains an area of interest, especially during the recent COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of this study is to safely extend INR testing intervals in patients throughout a multisite, system-wide anticoagulation clinic. Updates were made to the pharmacist’s collaborative practice agreement (CPA) and nurse protocol to optimize practice and allow INR testing interval extension up to a maximum of 8-weeks. The primary outcome was the change in duration between INR tests (INR testing interval) measured before and after providing staff education on clinic updates. The mean duration between INR tests (SD) was 23.69 days (11.29) in the pre-intervention period and 25.58 days (13.91) in the post-intervention period. During the COVID-19 pandemic (post2), intervals were extended further to 27.81 days (14.96), demonstrating a statistically significant increase in INR testing interval from pre-intervention to post-intervention and to post2 (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively). A secondary outcome indicated the mean time in therapeutic range (SD) showed no significant difference in pre-intervention 70.11% (25.95) versus post-intervention of 69.76% (25.69) with a difference of − 0.35% (29.93) (p = 0.956) or versus the post2 of 68.82% (27.20) with a difference of − 1.29% (33.20) (p = 0.120). This study showed that changes to the CPA and protocol allowed for a significant increase in INR testing interval while simultaneously maintaining a mean time in therapeutic range > 60% for the clinic population.","Papala, Michelle; Gillard, Deborah; Hardman, Jennifer; Romano, Teresa; Rein, Lisa E.",J Thromb Thrombolysis,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11239-021-02566-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34622376/,275
649360,"Home delivery of medication during Coronavirus disease 2019, Cape Town, South Africa: Short report",2020-06-04,"Traditionally, expert epidemiologists devise policies for disease control through a mixture of intuition and brute force. Namely, they use their know-how to narrow down the set of logically conceivable policies to a small family described by a few parameters, following which they conduct a grid search to identify the optimal policy within the set. This scheme is not scalable, in the sense that, when used to optimize over policies which depend on many parameters, it would likely fail to output an optimal disease policy in time for its implementation. In this article, we use techniques from convex optimization theory and machine learning to conduct optimizations over disease policies described by hundreds of parameters. We illustrate our approach by minimizing the total time required to eradicate COVID-19 within the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) model proposed by Kissler et al. (March, 2020). We observe that optimal policies are typically very complex, and thus unlikely to be discovered by a human agent.","Navascues, M.; Guryanova, Y.; Budroni, C.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.15.20194811v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.15.20194811,275

Methods: We evaluated the effect of age-specific vaccination strategies on the number of infections and deaths using an SEIR model, considering the age structure and social contact patterns for different age groups for each of different countries. Results: In general, the vaccination priority should be given to those younger people who are active in social contacts to minimize the number of infections; while the vaccination priority should be given to the elderly to minimize the number of deaths. But this principle may not always apply when the interaction of age structure and age-specific social contact patterns is complicated. Partially reopening schools, workplaces or households, the vaccination priority may need to be adjusted accordingly. Conclusions: Prematurely reopening social contacts could initiate a new outbreak or even a new pandemic out of control if the vaccination rate and the detection rate are not high enough. Our result suggests that it requires at least nine months of vaccination before fully reopening social contacts in order to avoid a new pandemic.","Wang, X.; Wu, H.; Tang, S.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.18.21251981v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.18.21251981,275

Direct diagnostic methods assay for the presence of the virus, while indirect methods test for effects of the virus. Cell culture is the process of growing cells or tissues in the laboratory. Cell lines can be infected with patient samples to allow viral replication within the cells; observable cytopathic effects can help to identify the identity of the virus. Infected cells can also be used for immunofluorescence assays, which use fluorescently labeled virus-specific antibodies to identify viruses in fixed cells or tissues. A variety of diagnostic immunoassays exist, including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays/enzyme immunoassays, western blots, lateral flow immunoassays, and agglutination reactions. Assays that detect viral nucleic acids are based upon the principles of PCR or nucleic acid hybridization, are extremely sensitive, and are specific for a particular virus.","Louten, Jennifer",Essential Human Virology,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128009475000077; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128009475000077,275

METHODS: We identified SARS-CoV-2 positive cases by polymerase chain reaction performed at our center within an updated RMDs database in our clinic. Additional RMDs patients were identified when they contacted the clinic because of a positive infection. Data extraction included diagnosis, demographics, immunosuppressive treatment, comorbidities, and laboratory tests. Comparisons between patients with or without hospitalization were performed. Multivariate logistic regression was used to analyze associations between baseline variables and need for hospitalization. RESULTS: A total of 62 patients with COVID-19 and underlying RMDs were identified by April 24, 2020. Median age was 60.9 years, and 42% men. Forty-two patients required hospitalization; these were more frequently men, older and with comorbidities. There were no statistically significant between-group differences for rheumatologic diagnosis and for baseline use of immunosuppressive therapy except for glucocorticoids that were more frequent in hospitalized patients. Total deaths were 10 (16%) patients. In multivariate analysis, male sex (odds ratio [OR], 8.63; p = 0.018), previous lung disease (OR, 27.47; p = 0.042), and glucocorticoids use (> 5 mg/day) (OR, 9.95; p = 0.019) were significantly associated to hospitalization. CONCLUSION: Neither specific RMD diagnoses or exposures to DMARDs were associated with increased odds of hospitalization. Being male, previous lung disease and exposure to glucocorticoids were associated with higher odds of hospitalization in RMDs patients.","Montero, Fernando; Martínez-Barrio, Julia; Serrano-Benavente, Belén; González, Teresa; Rivera, Javier; Molina Collada, Juan; Castrejón, Isabel; Álvaro-Gracia, Jose",Rheumatology International,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00296-020-04676-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32794113/; https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00296-020-04676-4.pdf,275

We examined the association between male sex and severe Covid-19 infection and if an increased risk remains after adjustment for age and comorbidities. METHODS: Nationwide register-based follow-up study of Covid-19 patients in Denmark until May 16, 2020. Average risk ratio comparing 30-day composite outcome of all-cause death, severe Covid-19 diagnosis or intensive care unit (ICU) admission for men versus women standardized to the age and comorbidity distribution of all patients were derived from multivariable Cox regression. Included covariates were age, hypertension, diagnoses including obesity, alcohol, sleep apnea, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, previous myocardial infarction (MI), ischemic heart disease (IHD), heart failure (HF), atrial fibrillation (AF), stroke, peripheral artery disease, cancer, liver-, rheumatic-, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). RESULTS: Of 4,842 Covid-19 patients, 2,281 (47.1%) were men. Median age was 57 [25%-75% 43-73] for men versus 52 [38-71] for women (P<0.001); however, octogenarians had equal sex distribution. Alcohol diagnosis, diabetes, hypertension, sleep apnea, prior MI and IHD (all P<0.001) as well as AF, stroke and HF (all P=0.01) were more often seen in men, and so was CKD (P=0.03). Obesity diagnosis (P<0.001) were more often seen in women. Other comorbidity differences were insignificant (P>0.05). The fully adjusted average risk ratio was 1.63 [95% CI 1.44-1.84].

METHODS: This study comprised 580 women aged between 18 and 65 years old, who completed self-report measures, during the mandatory confinement in Portugal due to COVID-19. The total sample was divided into four groups, according to their BMI. RESULTS: Results revealed that overall, there were no significant differences between the groups regarding the eating and exercise routine changes introduced during quarantine. However, significant differences between the four groups were found in the reported body and eating-related difficulties (shape concern, weight concern, and binge eating behaviours), with the pre-obesity and obesity groups presenting significant higher levels. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that, even though the changes introduced to the eating and exercise routine are independent of BMI, the pre-obesity and obesity group represent a major vulnerability group for the development of eating disorders.

OBJECTIVES: To describe the wide-scale implementation of a reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) multiple variants assay with melting curve analysis as a routine procedure. STUDY DESIGN: We prospectively performed multiple variants RT-PCR on consecutive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive samples from patients, healthcare workers and nursing home residents from our hospital catchment area. This technique was implemented in our automated Roche FLOW system with a turn-around time of 6 h. RESULTS: Between February 1 and May 2, 2021, 989 samples were tested by the variant RT-PCR. Our method was validated by comparison of variant RT-PCR to whole genome sequencing testing. We observed an increase over time in the proportion of UK variant that became the dominant variant, and the concurrent emergence of the South-African and Brazilian variants. Prompt public health responses for infection control were possible because of this rapid screening method, resulting in early detection and reduction of unnoticed spread of VOC as early as possible. CONCLUSION: A variant RT-PCR with additional melting curve analyses is a feasible, rapid and efficient screening strategy that can be implemented in routine microbiological laboratories.","Ong, David S.Y.; Koeleman, Johannes G.M.; Vaessen, Norbert; Breijer, Simone; Paltansing, Sunita; de Man, Peter",J Clin Virol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653221001700; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653221001700?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2021.104903; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34182300/,275

Because the clinically diagnosed cases in Hubei province were reported for the first time on February 13, 2020, a very high peak of new cases in China was observed. The reason why so many clinically diagnosed cases appeared was not clear. Methods: All data of new cases in China were acquired from WHO situation reports. Linear fitting was used to infer the ability to detect COVID-19 infections. Primer-BLAST and nucleotide blast were applied to check the specificity of primers. Expression data of human mRNA in different tissues was obtained from Human Protein Atlas. Finding: Based on the data and analysis of changes of new laboratory-confirmed cases and new clinically diagnosed cases, it was inferred that there were many false-negative results in all clinically diagnosed cases in Hubei province. There were eight non-specific primers in dozens of primers used in clinical or research detection of COVID-19. Among them, a pair of primer for the ORF1ab regions of SARS-CoV-2 genome, which widely applied to detect SARS-CoV-2 virus in China, well matched some human mRNAs such as Cathepsin C transcripts. Compared to other transcripts, Cathepsin C mRNA had a high abundance in tonsil, lung and small intestine. Interpretation: Some non-specific RT-PCR primers could cause the serious interference during RT-PCR amplification so as to increase the risk of false-negative diagnoses for COVID-19 infections.

To create a biologically meaningful diagnosis, attention should be dedicated to various biotic factors and not only of the diagnostic assay. Included among the important factors are, (a) the sample examined and the sampling strategy, (b) the outcomes of the pathogen amplification ex vivo, (c) the sampling time and its reflection on the disease diagnosis, (d) the impact of simultaneous multiple virus-infections regarding the ability to demonstrate all pathogens and inter- and intra-interactions between the pathogens. A concerted consideration of the relevant factors and the use of advanced molecular diagnostic assay would yield biologically significant diagnosis in real-time that would beneficiate the poultry industry.","Davidson, Irit",J Virol Methods,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093419301703; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2019.113708; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31351169/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093419301703,275
676880,“Better than having no evaluation done”: a pilot project to conduct remote asylum evaluations for clients in a migrant encampment in Mexico,2021-05-26,"A significant number of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that is associated with a poor outcome. The molecular mechanisms driving failure of the alveolar barrier upon severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection remain incompletely understood. The Na,K-ATPase is an adhesion molecule and a plasma membrane transporter that is critically required for proper alveolar epithelial function by both promoting barrier integrity and resolution of excess alveolar fluid, thus enabling appropriate gas exchange. However, numerous SARS-CoV-2-mediated and COVID-19-related signals directly or indirectly impair the function of the Na,K-ATPase, thereby potentially contributing to disease progression. In this Perspective, we highlight some of the putative mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2-driven dysfunction of the Na,K-ATPase, focusing on expression, maturation, and trafficking of the transporter. A therapeutic mean to selectively inhibit the maladaptive signals that impair the Na,K-ATPase upon SARS-CoV-2 infection might be effective in reestablishing the alveolar epithelial barrier and promoting alveolar fluid clearance and thus advantageous in patients with COVID-19-associated ARDS.","Kryvenko, Vitalii; Vadász, István",Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol,https://doi.org/10.1152/ajplung.00056.2021; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33689516/,275
677489,Engagement With COVID-19 Public Health Measures in the United States: A Cross-sectional Social Media Analysis from June to November 2020,2021-06-21,"The impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on quality of life appears to be highly underestimated, especially in patients who have not been admitted to the hospital. Therefore, our aim was to assess respiratory-specific quality of life in addition to generic quality of life in former patients with confirmed/suspected COVID-19 who have never been admitted to the hospital. Members of an online Belgian social support group for patients with confirmed/suspected COVID-19 with persistent complaints, completed an online survey. The five-level EQ-5D (EQ-5D-5L) and the Clinical COPD Questionnaire (CCQ) were used to assess generic and respiratory-specific quality of life, respectively. Data of 210 non-hospitalized patients (88% women, 45 ± 11 years, 79 ± 17 days after symptom onset) were included in the analyses. Mean EQ-5D index and visual analogue scale (EQ-VAS) score was 0.62 ± 0.19 and 50.71 ± 18.87, respectively, with 40% of the patients demonstrating an EQ-5D index that was below the fifth percentile of normative values, indicating poor generic quality of life. The mean CCQ score was 2.01 ± 0.98 points, while 123 respondents (59%) had a total score ≥1.9 points, indicating poor respiratory-specific quality of life. The correlation between EQ-5D index score/EQ-VAS score and CCQ total score was moderate (r = −0.524 and r = −0.374; both p < 0.001). In conclusion, both generic and respiratory-specific quality of life are affected in non-hospitalized patients with COVID-19, approximately three months after the onset of symptoms. The combined use of the EQ-5D and the CCQ could identify the broad impact of COVID-19 on quality of life.","Meys, Roy; Delbressine, Jeannet M.; Goërtz, Yvonne M.J.; Vaes, Anouk W.; Machado, Felipe V.C.; Van Herck, Maarten; Burtin, Chris; Posthuma, Rein; Spaetgens, Bart; Franssen, Frits M.E.; Spies, Yvonne; Vijlbrief, Herman; van’t Hul, Alex J.; Janssen, Daisy J.A.; Spruit, Martijn A.; Houben-Wilke, Sarah",J Clin Med,https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm9123993; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33317214/,275
685312,"Geographic Distribution of Mental Health Problems Among Chinese College Students During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Nationwide, Web-Based Survey Study",2021-01-29,"The access of people with disabilities to digital solutions promotes their inclusion and participation in many aspects of life. Computer games based on hearing or haptic devices have been gaining popularity among persons with visual impairment (VI), and players tend to display improved spatial and abstract reasoning skills, as well as better social interaction and self-confidence, after playing these games. However, a recent survey suggested that excessive gaming could represent a public health concern as a harmful form of behavior in young people associated with risk factors of negative psychosomatic and physical complaints. Young persons with VI are regular users of various technologies, but little is still known about their media patterns. This study aimed to determine the characteristics of the variables associated with gaming for adolescents with VI. The participants were 490 students, aged 13–24 years, from special schools for students with VI. Data was collected using a self-administered questionnaire. The current survey indicated a tendency towards excessive gaming in a significant proportion of young persons with VI. Sociodemographic variables are important in predicting gaming prevalence or screen time, but further research focused on establishing possible mediators (such as parental attitudes towards media) are necessary for identifying problematic gaming behaviors among students with VI.","Wrzesińska, Magdalena Agnieszka; Tabała, Klaudia; Stecz, Patryk",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33561942/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18041545,275
686850,Herintreders gebaat bij duidelijkheid en ruimte,2020-04-30,"Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is characterized by massive inflammation, increased vascular permeability and pulmonary edema. Mortality due to ARDS remains very high and even in the case of survival, acute lung injury can lead to pulmonary fibrosis. The renin–angiotensin system (RAS) plays a significant role in these processes. The activities of RAS molecules are subject to dynamic changes in response to an injury. Initially, increased levels of angiotensin (Ang) II and des-Arg(9)-bradykinin (DABK), are necessary for an effective defense. Later, augmented angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 2 activity supposedly helps to attenuate inflammation. Appropriate ACE2 activity might be decisive in preventing immune-induced damage and ensuring tissue repair. ACE2 has been identified as a common target for different pathogens. Some Coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, also use ACE2 to infiltrate the cells. A number of questions remain unresolved. The importance of ACE2 shedding, associated with the release of soluble ACE2 and ADAM17-mediated activation of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)-signaling is unclear. The roles of other non-classical RAS-associated molecules, e.g., alamandine, Ang A or Ang 1–9, also deserve attention. In addition, the impact of established RAS-inhibiting drugs on the pulmonary RAS is to be elucidated. The unfavorable prognosis of ARDS and the lack of effective treatment urge the search for novel therapeutic strategies. In the context of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and considering the involvement of humoral disbalance in the pathogenesis of ARDS, targeting the renin–angiotensin system and reducing the pathogen’s cell entry could be a promising therapeutic strategy in the struggle against COVID-19.","Hrenak, Jaroslav; Simko, Fedor",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33126657/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21218038,275
