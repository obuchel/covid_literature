73376,Walking on quicksand and dancing with electrons.,2020-05-03,"According to the literature review, CO2 insufflation on parasitic myoma implantation is not well studied, and we concur that our study is related to ""Morcellation-induced parasitic myomas."" We did not compare CO2 insufflation to non-insufflation in our study. The reason is the efficacy of gasless laparoscopic myomectomy and morcellation is not well established and this modality is seldom performed. Moreover, the effects of pneumoperitoneum on mesothelial cells and the role of the entire peritoneal cavity as a cofactor in adhesion formation have become well established, the role of CO2 insufflation in the establishment of parasitic myomas has not yet been studied. As such, more in-depth and well-designed studies for the role of CO2 insufflation are needed.","Huang, Ben-Shian; Horng, Huann-Cheng; Wang, Peng-Hui; Yang, Muh-Hwa; Chen, Yi-Jen",Reproductive biology and endocrinology : RB&E,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12958-017-0270-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28732509/,891

We have hypothesized that such high levels of somatic hypermutation could pose a challenge for elicitation of the broadly neutralizing (bn) Abs and that identification of less somatically mutated bn Abs may help in the design of effective vaccine immunogens. In a quest for such bn Abs, phage- and yeast-displayed antibody libraries, constructed using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from a patient with bn serum containing Abs targeting the epitope of the bn MAb 2F5, were panned against peptides containing the 2F5 epitope and against the HIV-1 gp140(JR-FL). Two MAbs (m66 and m66.6) were identified; the more mutated variant (m66.6) exhibited higher HIV-1-neutralizing activity than m66, although it was weaker than 2F5 in a TZM-bl cell assay. Binding of both MAbs to gp41 alanine substitution mutant peptides required the DKW(664-666) core of the 2F5 epitope and two additional upstream residues (L(660,663)). The MAbs have long (21-residue) heavy-chain third complementarity-determining regions (CDR-H3s), and m66.6 (but not m66) exhibited polyspecific reactivity to self- and non-self-antigens. Both m66 and m66.6 are significantly less divergent from their germ line Ab counterparts than 2F5--they have a total of 11 and 18 amino acid changes, respectively, from the closest VH and Vκ germ line gene products compared to 25 for 2F5. These new MAbs could help explore the complex maturation pathways involved in broad neutralization and its relationship with auto- and polyreactivity and may aid design of vaccine immunogens and development of therapeutics against HIV-1 infection.","Zhu, Zhongyu; Qin, Haiyan Rebekah; Chen, Weizao; Zhao, Qi; Shen, Xiaoying; Schutte, Robert; Wang, Yanping; Ofek, Gilad; Streaker, Emily; Prabakaran, Ponraj; Fouda, Genevieve G; Liao, Hua-Xin; Owens, John; Louder, Mark; Yang, Yongping; Klaric, Kristina-Ana; Moody, M Anthony; Mascola, John R; Scott, Jamie K; Kwong, Peter D; Montefiori, David; Haynes, Barton F; Tomaras, Georgia D; Dimitrov, Dimiter S",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.05312-11; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21880764/,891
109404,Response to 'Defining and measuring denigration of general practice in medical education'.,2020-08-28,"BACKGROUND Esophageal cancer has a poor prognosis because of its rapid progression and early and extensive lymph node metastasis. Simple, objective indicators for predicting long-term outcomes are needed to select optimal perioperative treatment and appropriate follow-up for patients with esophageal cancer. The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between the lymphocyte-to-C-reactive protein ratio (LCR) and the survival of patients with esophageal cancer, by performing time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. The results were compared to those of traditional inflammation-based markers. METHODS This study enrolled 495 patients who underwent thoracic esophagectomy for esophageal cancer as the primary treatment between 2000 and 2019 in our department. We investigated the predictability of the LCR for oncological outcomes compared to that of other traditional inflammatory markers. RESULTS The 3-year overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were 72.6% and 57.5%, respectively. Low LCR was significantly associated with higher cancer stage, included depth of invasion (p < 0.001), lymph node metastasis (p < 0.001) and cStage (p < 0.001). The LCR had the highest AUC value (0.675) for predicting OS compared to the other examined inflammatory markers. In multivariate analysis, the LCR (optimal cutoff threshold = 19,000) was identified as a significant predictor of death (hazard ratio, 2.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.61-3.12; p < 0.001) and recurrence (hazard ratio, 1.97; 95%CI, 1.48-2.63; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION The LCR is novel indicator for oncological outcomes for patients with esophageal cancer and may assist to facilitate personalized multidisciplinary treatments.","Takeuchi, Masashi; Kawakubo, Hirofumi; Hoshino, Shota; Matsuda, Satoru; Mayanagi, Shuhei; Irino, Tomoyuki; Fukuda, Kazumasa; Nakamura, Rieko; Wada, Norihito; Kitagawa, Yuko",World journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00268-021-06269-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34383091/,891
126771,Instagram for peer teaching: opportunity and challenge.,2020-08-23,"The SARS-CoV-2 has emerged in China at the end of 2019. In order to meet the growing demand in laboratories for RT-PCR testing for viral genome detection, rapid tests detecting a SARS-CoV-2 protein (antigenic rapid test) have been developed. In this review, we present for different SARS-CoV-2 antigenic rapid tests authorized in France: legislation, technological principle, and analytical and clinical performances. Data bellow are those provided by the manufacturer/distributor. From the list of tests authorized by the French Ministry of Health, we have selected 25 for which the distributors/manufacturers have provided the technical data essential to their comparative analysis. The kits use immunochromatography technology, with detection of the nucleocapsid protein (n = 24) or the spike protein (n = 1). The matrix used is a nasopharyngeal (n = 23), oropharyngeal (n = 9) or nasal (n = 3) swab. According to the test, the reading of the result is done from 15 to 30 minutes after it is performed. The clinical sensitivity, for the more performant tests is conversely linked to the Ct of RT-PCR, ranging from 80.2% to 98.4%, according to the quantity of virus present in the sample. This percentage is inversely proportional to the Ct obtained using RT-PCR. The limit of detection ranges from 31.55 to 7200 TCID50/mL. The clinical specificity, compared to a negative result of RT-PCR, is between 99.2% and 100%. Analytical specificity evaluated on other microorganisms is 100%, except for 3 kits that show cross-reactivities with SARS-CoV-1 (n = 3) and MERS-CoV (n = 1). Positive and negative predictive values range from 96.3% to 100% and 95% to 99.4%, respectively.","Lim, Isabelle; Gautheret-Dejean, Agnès",Annales de biologie clinique,https://doi.org/10.1684/abc.2021.1635; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33881398/,891

METHODS: A total of 100 patients and their partners or carers were invited to complete questionnaires regarding the impact of SSc on quality of life and psychological wellbeing using valid and reliable patient-reported outcome measures (OHIP-14, MHISS, OIDP, MDAS and HADS. A total of 50 patients with SSc and 18 partners or carers who acted as controls returned the completed questionnaires. Statistical analyses were performed for comparisons of different variables. RESULTS: All the mean scores of OHIP-14 [SSc (16.5±12.4) Vs controls (6.06±7.6, P .001)], MHISS components were significantly higher in patients than those of control group [SSc (21.26±12) Vs controls (4.8±7.3, P<.0001)]. Majority of OIDP mean scores were significantly worse in patients compared with controls [SSc (10±8.7) Vs controls (1.72±3.4, P<.0001)]. The mean of total MDAS [SSc (11.7±5.3) Vs controls (9.5±4.4)] and HADS scores were higher in patients compared to controls [SSc depression (4.8±3.3) and anxiety (6±4.6) Vs controls (3.7±3.1) (4.7±3.9)]. CONCLUSIONS: Although the present study are limited by the low response rate and its cross-sectional design, present results highlighted that systemic sclerosis has a negative impact on OHRQoL of the affected individuals hence the evaluation of associated psychological impact including anxiety and depression symptoms is needed to better understand, monitor and evaluate the disease comorbidity in patients with SSc.","Abdouh, Ismail; Porter, Stephen; Fedele, Stefano; Elgendy, Nadia; Aboalshamat, Khalid; Ali Babkair, Hamzah; Ni Riordain, Richeal",J. oral pathol. med,,891

Functional significance of peripheral memory T cell subsets in COVID-19 convalescents (CONV) are beginning to be appreciated; but little is known about lung resident memory T cell (lung TRM) responses and their role in limiting the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we utilize a perfusion three dimensional (3D) human lung tissue model and identify pre-existing local T cell immunity against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and structural antigens in the lung tissues. We report ex vivo maintenance of functional multi-specific IFN-{gamma} secreting lung TRM in CONV and their induction in lung tissues of vaccinated CONV. Importantly, we identify SARS-CoV-2 spike peptide-responding B cells in lung tissues of CONV in ex vivo 3D-tissue models. Our study highlights a balanced and local anti-viral immune response in the lung and persistent induction of TRM cells as an essential component for future protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further, our data suggest that inclusion of multiple viral antigens in vaccine approaches may broaden the functional profile of memory T cells to combat the severity of coronavirus infection.","Goliwas, Kayla F.; Simmons, Christopher S.; Khan, Saad A.; Wood, Anthony M.; Wang, Yong; Berry, Joel L.; Athar, Mohammad; Mobley, James A; Kim, Young-il; Thannickal, Victor J; Harrod, Kevin S; Donahue, James M; Deshane, Jessy S.",,,891

One of the drugs for gout is allopurinol that acts as a xanthin oxidase inhibitor (XOI). However, this drug has side effects, so we need safer drugs from herbal sources such as sugar apple. Sugar apple ethanol extract can act as XOI, but the activity of steeping with hot water is not known. Besides, several sugar apple compounds are also reported to be active as anti-viruses, but their activity has not been categorized against the COVID-19. This study aimed at making powder from sugar apple, which was brew using hot water, determined the phytochemical content, including TPC and TFC, tested its activity as XOI and the profile bond of the active compounds to the S protein of COVID-19. The results showed that the extract of sugar apple powder contained alkaloids, flavonoids, polyphenols, with TPC and TFC levels of 0.048% and 0.099%, active as XOI. Furthermore, the in silico analysis has shown three compounds in sugar apple, namely quercetin-3-glucoside, rutin, and kaempferol-3-rutinoside that can bound to the RBD of S protein of COVID-19, so it is predicted that the three compounds have anti-COVID-19 activity. © 2021 Author(s).","Muna, I.

This prospective cohort study included 303 patients hospitalized for COVID-19. Participants were first classified according to the presence of obesity; then, they were classified according to the presence of MS. Clinical, radiologic, and analytical parameters were collected. We reported that patients with obesity presented moderate COVID-19 symptoms and pneumonia, bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, and needed tocilizumab more frequently. Meanwhile, patients with MS presented severe pneumonia and respiratory failure more frequently, they have a higher mortality rate, and they also showed higher creatinine and troponin levels. The main findings of this study are that IL-6 is a potential predictor of COVID-19 severity in patients with obesity, while troponin and LDH can be used as predictive biomarkers of COVID-19 severity in MS patients.

Chest sonography plays a key role in the approach for this group of patients, through extended and focused evaluation with trauma sonography (E-FAST). OBJECTIVES: To establish the diagnostic performance of the extension of the thoracic spine sign using chest sonography in trauma to diagnose hemothorax and compare it with the gold standard test chest computed tomography (CT). METHODS: This prospective observational study was conducted over 1 year. Patients who attended the emergency room with closed or penetrating thoracic or thoraco-abdominal trauma, an indication for a chest CT as part of a diagnostic evaluation according to institutional protocols, and who previously underwent a chest sonogram to determine the extent of the thoracic spine sign to diagnose hemothorax. Sonographic results were compared to a radiologist's interpretation of the chest CT. The radiologists were blinded to the initial sonogram interpretation. RESULTS: Seventy-six patients were enrolled with an average age of 32 years. They mainly had closed trauma, which accounted for 77.6% of samples, and 222 chest images were taken. The sensitivity and specificity for this study were 78.7% and 92.6%, respectively, with a positive predictive value and negative predictive value of 65% and 97.8%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Extension of the thoracic spine sign allows rapid identification of the presence, and more precisely, the absence of pleural effusion. This, therefore, allows an appropriate diagnosis and approach in the emergency room in patients with chest trauma.","Vargas, Carlos A; Quintero, Jaime; Figueroa, Roger; Castro, Andrés; Watts, Fredy A",,,891

It is the best measure to maintain extreme social distancing which has been effective in controlling the infection and saving lives. But they are causing huge loss economically, disrupting social life and causing distress around the world. Reopening too quickly or too boldly without a goal-oriented strategy could mean a second wave of infection as fierce or even worse as the first. The fundamentals of the virus remain the same - one infected person will, without a lockdown pass it onto three others on average. The consequences of lifting the lockdown are unforeseeable and the stakes are high. Due to the different spectrum of severity with same strain of virus and uncertainty of post lockdown era, lifting the lockdown will be a trial and error approach. Nevertheless, at some point the lockdown has to be lifted. The strategic approach would be innumerable testing, investigations, strong contact tracing, isolation and follow-up.

Severe COVID-19 is marked by aberrant innate and adaptive immune responses with an abnormal cytokine profile and a prolonged illness course with multisystem organ dysfunction. Antiviral treatments have yet to show benefit later in critical illness. Taken together, this raises the concern that a purely antiviral treatment approach may be insufficient. A number of immunomodulatory strategies are being tested, including corticosteroids, cytokine and anti-cytokine therapies, small molecule inhibitors, and cellular therapeutics. The only drug to date to show a mortality benefit for COVID-19 in a randomized control trial is dexamethasone, but there remains uncertainty about which patients may benefit most and longer-term complications including secondary infections.
