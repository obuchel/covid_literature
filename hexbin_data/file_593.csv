25302,Infectieproblematiek,2007,"The risk factors for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) have been a focus for clinicians and researchers from the original description in 1967 to the most recent Pediatric Acute Lung Injury Consensus Conference (PALICC). Indeed, there are many comorbidities and risk factors that predispose a patient to develop pediatric ARDS (PARDS) including, but not limited to, immunodeficiency, weight extremes, genetics, and environmental factors. These are particularly important to investigators because accurate prediction of which patients are at greatest risk of PARDS – both the development of PARDS and worse clinical outcomes after PARDS has been established – is key to identifying the next generation of diagnostic techniques and preventative strategies. In addition to those risk factors, there are specific disease processes that lead to the development of PARDS, often divided into direct or pulmonary insults and indirect or extrapulmonary insults. Finally, beyond the clinically visible risk factors, researchers are attempting to identify novel biomarkers to uncover hidden phenotypes of PARDS and enrich the prognostication and prediction of patient outcomes. This chapter delves into each of these concepts.","Kohne, Joseph G.; Flori, Heidi R.",Pediatric Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121855/,593

However, testing capacities are limited. A modified testing protocol, whereby a number of probes are ""pooled"" (that is, grouped), is known to increase the capacity for testing. Here, we model pooled testing with a double-average model, which we think to be close to reality for Covid-19 testing. The optimal pool size and the effect of test errors are considered. Results show that the best pool size is three to five, under reasonable assumptions. Pool testing even reduces the number of false positives in the absence of dilution effects.","Pikovski, Alexander; Bentele, Kajetan",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.08.20125781,593

The study focused mainly on listeners of ABS radio news broadcast in Awka, the capital of Anambra State, Nigeria. Its objectives were to find out; if Awka based students are exposed to ABS radio; to discover the ABS radio program students favorite; the need gratification that drives students to listen to ABS radio news; the contributions of radio news to students teaching and learning; and effectiveness of ABS radio news on teaching and learning in Awka. The population of Awka students is 198,868. This is also the population of the study. But a sample size of 400 was chosen and administered with questionnaires. The study was hinged on the uses and gratification theory. It adopted a survey research design. The data gathered was analyzed using simple percentages and frequency of tables. The study revealed that news is very effective in teaching and learning. It was concluded that news is the best instructional media to be employed in teaching and learning. Among other things, it was recommended that teachers and students should listen to and make judicious use of news for academic purposes.","Onuegbu, Okechukwu Christopher",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.02925v1.pdf,593

Medical diseases are present in at least 50% of all patients with psychiatric conditions, and severe mental disorders are associated with significant physical comorbidity and mortality. Early data show that individuals with preexisting multiple chronic conditions have a higher mortality risk when they are symptomatic with COVID-19. Although mitigation guidelines and recommendations are constantly being reviewed and updated, we found no specific recommendations targeting the vulnerable population who use CMH systems or the publicly funded and managed behavioral health entities which serve them. We reviewed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines regarding infection control in health care facilities that provide ambulatory care, including behavioral health clinics, as well as reviewed recent population outcomes data. We posit that the population served by the CMH systems is a higher-risk cohort than the general population and offer recommendations for effective infection prevention strategies specific to this population.","Alavi, Z.; Haque, R.; Haque, A.; Meier, D.",Consultant,https://doi.org/10.25270/con.2020.05.00020,593
185096,[A three-year follow-up study on sera specific antibody in severe acute respiratory syndrome cases after the onset of illness].,2007,"Background Due to the corona pandemic the question arose of how a flipped classroom in the ENT can be designed without the presence of students. In addition, it was important to consider which competencies could and should be achieved in this way Methods To maintain the contact-reducing requirements, a completely digital teaching format was developed. The learning objectives were first revised and adapted to the new learning concept. An e-learning tool was developed to transform the cognitive content in the pre-class phase. The seminars of the in-class phase were redesigned and held online as a zoom conference. The students (n = 133) were asked to evaluate the digital concept using a short questionnaire. Results Due to the elimination of the face-to-face events and thus the practical exercises, the learning objectives could be achieved only at competence level 2 in the COVID-19 semester 2020. 71% of the students rated the digital implementation of the seminar as good or very good and 64% of the students saw a high to very high added value of the e-learning tool compared to working through a textbook. By completing the e-learning course, the vast majority of students (62%) were able to follow the seminar better and to consolidate their knowledge. Only 21% of the students prefered a lecture to the online seminar with prior e-learning. Conclusion The newly designed online seminars in connection with the e-learning tool is an appropriate teaching format, which is very well accepted by the students, for medical education in ENT. This teaching format implements the contact-reducing requirements. However, there are limitations with regard to achieving higher levels of competence, especially concerning psychomotor learning objectives, which have to be taken into consideration.","Spiekermann, C.

186827,[The application of a systematic-dynamic model to study the computer simulation of severe acute respiratory syndrome transmission and the impact of control measures].,2005,"Background Personal protective equipment (PPE) is worn by workers in surgical settings to protect them and patients. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clears some PPE (e.g., surgical masks (SM)) as class II medical devices, and regulates some (e.g. surgical head cover) as class I exempt devices. For respiratory protection, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)-approved N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs), and powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs) are used. One type of PPE, ""surgical N95 respirators"", is a NIOSH-approved FFR that is also cleared by the FDA for use in medical settings. The surgical environment poses unique risks such as the potential for surgical fires. As part of its substantial equivalence determination process, FDA requests testing of flammability and other parameters for SM and surgical N95 respirators. A lack of data regarding flammability of PPE used in healthcare exists. We hypothesize that commonly used PPE, regardless of whether regulated and/or cleared by FDA or not, will pass an industry standard such as the 16 CFR 1610 flammability test. Methods Eleven N95 FFR models, eight surgical N95 respirator models, seven SM models, five surgical head cover models, and five PAPR hood models were evaluated for flammability with a 45 degree flammability tester using the 16 CFR 1610 method. Three common fabrics were included for comparison. Results All of the PPE samples regulated/and or cleared by FDA or not, passed the flammability test at class 1 (normal flammability), meaning they are less likely to burn. Only one of the three common fabrics, a cotton fabric at the lowest basis weight, was class 3 (high flammability). Conclusions The results obtained in the study suggest that NIOSH-approved N95 FFRs would likely pass the 16 CFR 1610 flammability standard. Moreover, results suggest that NIOSH is capable of undertaking flammability testing using the 16 CFR 1610 standard as the flammability results NIOSH obtained for N95 FFRs were comparable to the results obtained by a third party independent laboratory.","Rengasamy, Samy; Niezgoda, George; Shaffer, Ron",Journal of the International Society for Respiratory Protection,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30364752/,593

189183,[Effectiveness of personal protective measures in prevention of nosocomial transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome].,2004,"Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), is an enteropathogenic coronavirus that causes a highly fatal acute diarrhea in newborn pigs. It's typically clinical manifestations consist of omitting, severe diarrhea, loss water and highly infectious disease. All kinds and ages of pigs can be infected. Particular, the mortality piglets under 3 weeks may reach 100% . The effective protection against TGEV requires the development of vaccines that are able to induce local mucosal immunization. Lactococcus lactis was selected as a bacterial carrier for the expression of TGEV spike glycoprotein. The gene of S glycoprotein was cloned into the Lactococcus lactis vectors pNZ8112. An approximately 2000 bps fragments of TGEV gene S that encompasses all the four major antigenic domains critical for neutralization was transformed into Lactococcus lactis NZ9000 by electroporation, resulting in the recombinant strain pNZ8112-Sa/NZ9000. The recombinant glycoprotein S was detected by SDS-PAGE and Western blot after induced by 1ng/mL nisin. The result indicated that the expressed product maintain the antigenicity of TGEV as expected. In order to detect the location of expressed protein, the yellow and green fluorescence of the recombinant strain pNZ8112-Sa/NZ9000 was detected by the IFA experiments, which indicated that the expressed recombinant protein was secreted and located on the surface of the bacterium cell. Oral immunization of BALB/c mice with recombinant strain that constitutively express the 66kDa fragment of the glycoprotein S, Specific anti-TGEV glycoprotein S secret immunoglobulin A (sIgA) antibodies were detected by indirect enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in the feces after immunization. It was showed that the mice immunized with pNZ8112-Sa/NZ9000 recombinant strain had produced clear antibody level anti TGEV, and which had provided important substance foundation and explored the feasibility of Lactobacillus as oral vaccine.","Tang, Li-jie; Ou, Di; Ge, Jun-wei; Xu, Yi-gang; Li, Yi-jing; Shi, Da; Xia, Chun-li; Yu, Yin",Wei sheng wu xue bao = Acta microbiologica Sinica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17552246/,593

189786,[Study on the risk factors related to severe acute respiratory syndrome among close contactors in Beijing].,2004,"We have previously reported that a subunit protein vaccine based on the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) spike protein and a recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV)-based RBD (RBD-rAAV) vaccine could induce highly potent neutralizing Ab responses in immunized animals. In this study, systemic, mucosal, and cellular immune responses and long-term protective immunity induced by RBD-rAAV were further characterized in a BALB/c mouse model, with comparison of the i.m. and intranasal (i.n.) routes of administration. Our results demonstrated that: 1) the i.n. vaccination induced a systemic humoral immune response of comparable strength and shorter duration than the i.m. vaccination, but the local humoral immune response was much stronger; 2) the i.n. vaccination elicited stronger systemic and local specific cytotoxic T cell responses than the i.m. vaccination, as evidenced by higher prevalence of IL-2 and/or IFN-gamma-producing CD3+/CD8+ T cells in both lungs and spleen; 3) the i.n. vaccination induced similar protection as the i.m. vaccination against SARS-CoV challenge in mice; 4) higher titers of mucosal IgA and serum-neutralizing Ab were associated with lower viral load and less pulmonary pathological damage, while no Ab-mediated disease enhancement effect was observed; and 5) the vaccination could provide long-term protection against SARS-CoV infection. Taken together, our findings suggest that RBD-rAAV can be further developed into a vaccine candidate for prevention of SARS and that i.n. vaccination may be the preferred route of administration due to its ability to induce SARS-CoV-specific systemic and mucosal immune responses and its better safety profile.","Du, Lanying; Zhao, Guangyu; Lin, Yongping; Sui, Hongyan; Chan, Chris; Ma, Selene; He, Yuxian; Jiang, Shibo; Wu, Changyou; Yuen, Kwok-Yung; Jin, Dong-Yan; Zhou, Yusen; Zheng, Bo-Jian",Journal of immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18178835/,593

190447,[Epidemiological features of severe acute respiratory syndrome in Beijing].,2003,"Minute virus of canines (MVC), also known as canine parvovirus type 1, was initially believed to be a nonpathogenic agent, since it was first isolated from canine fecal specimens in the late 1960s. However, subsequent pathological as well as epidemiological studies suggested that MVC is a pathogen of neonatal puppies and is widely distributed among domestic dogs in the United States. The virus also has been shown to cause fetal deaths. Nevertheless, the virus was not detected in dogs outside the United States until recently, presumably because of a lack of widespread availability of the only susceptible canine cell line, WRCC/3873D, used for MVC isolation. We examined 470 clinical specimens from 346 dogs by PCR and detected MVC-specific gene fragments from four diseased puppies (positive rate, 1.2%). Viruses were recovered from three PCR-positive rectal specimens by using WRCC/3873D and MDCK cells. The isolates possessed antigenic and genomic properties similar to those of the U.S. reference strain GA3 and were identified as MVC. In addition, seroepidemiological evidence that 5.0% of dogs possessed anti-MVC antibodies also indicated the presence of MVC infection among dogs in Japan. From this study and several recent European reports describing MVC field cases, it is evident that MVC is distributed among domestic dogs worldwide.","Mochizuki, Masami; Hashimoto, Michiru; Hajima, Takayuki; Takiguchi, Mitsuyoshi; Hashimoto, Akira; Une, Yumi; Roerink, Frank; Ohshima, Takahisa; Parrish, Colin R; Carmichael, Leland E",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12409364/,593

192971,[To develop a model on severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemics to quantitatively evaluate the effectiveness of intervention measures].,2005,"BACKGROUND Amiodarone induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) occurs with considerable incidence and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Factors that predict poor prognosis in this disease have not yet been sufficiently investigated. OBJECTIVES We examined the characteristics and short-term clinical outcomes of patients with AIT (up to six months from diagnosis). We evaluated the relationship between T3 and T4 levels at time of presentation and complications associated with AIT. METHODS A retrospective epidemiological study was conducted reviewing all cases diagnosed with thyrotoxicosis and amiodarone consumption of patients treated in the Carmel Medical Center between the years 2004-2008. We examined the characteristics of patients who tend to develop AIT. In addition, we examined whether T3 and T4 levels at the time of presentation were a predictor of a poor prognosis. Three major complications associated with AIT were defined as primary outcomes within six months of diagnosis: 1. mortality; 2. development of AIT-related complications that required hospitalization; 3. the need for thyroidectomy. RESULTS A total of 400 patients were diagnosed with thyrotoxicosis and consumed amiodarone. However, only 39 patients met the definition of AIT. The composite outcome of mortality, AIT-related complications and thyroidectomy were found in the vast majority of patients (94.8%, 37 out of 39 participants); 3 (7.6%) died and 35 (89.7%) were hospitalized with AIT-related complications and 8 (20.5%) required thyroidectomy. We found a statistically significant relationship between high T4 levels (above 64.3 mcg/dL or above 3 times the upper limit of the norm) and the composite of two main endpoints: mortality and the need for thyroidectomy in the first half year of diagnosis (P=0.009). CONCLUSIONS AIT is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. An elevated level of free T4 reflects the severity of AIT. In patients with significantly increased T4 values, an early surgical intervention should be considered.","Khalaili, Luai; Aker, Amir; Naoum, Ibrahim; Kassem, Sameer",Harefuah,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34396727/,593

195308,[Study on the epidemiology and measures for control on severe acute respiratory syndrome in Guangzhou city].,2003,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has affected millions across the world. Significant patient surges have caused severe resource allocation challenges in personal protective equipment, medications, and staffing. The virus produces bilateral lung infiltrates causing significant oxygen depletion and respiratory failure thus increasing the need for ventilators. The patients who require ventilation are often requiring prolonged ventilation and depleting hospital resources. Tracheostomy is often utilized in patients requiring prolonged ventilation, and early tracheostomy in critical care patients has been shown in some studies to improve a variety of factors including intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay, ventilation weaning, and decreased sedation medication utilization. In a patient surge setting, as long as adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) is available to minimize spread to healthcare workers, early tracheostomy may be a beneficial management of these patients. Decreasing sedative medication utilization may help prevent shortages in future waves of infection and improve patient-provider communication as patients are more alert. Tracheostomy care is easier than endotracheal intubation and may have decreased viral aerosolization risk, particularly if repeat intubation is necessary after a weaning trial. Additionally, tracheostomy patients can be monitored with less staff, decreasing total healthcare worker exposure to infection. To manage risk of exposure, coordination of ventilation controlled by an anesthesiologist or a critical care physician with a surgeon during the procedure can minimize aerosolization to the team. Risk management and resource allocation is of the utmost importance in any global crisis and procedures must be appropriately planned and benefits to patients, as well as minimized exposure to healthcare providers, must be considered. Early tracheostomy could be a beneficial procedure for severe SARS-CoV-2 patients to minimize long-term virus aerosolization and exposure for healthcare workers while decreasing sedation, allowing for earlier transfer out of the ICU, and improving hospital resource utilization.","Sier, Rachel S; Onugha, Osita I",Surgical technology international,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33494117/,593

However, the diagnostic potential of AGP might be limited because AGP also increases in pathophysiological conditions other than FIP. In this retrospective study, the diagnostic potential of serum AGP concentration was evaluated on the basis of the pretest probability of disease, according to the Bayesian approach. Serum AGP levels from cats with FIP (group 1; n = 58) and without FIP (group 2; n = 104) were evaluated. Non-FIP cats were further subgrouped as follows: 2a) inflammation (n = 26), 2b) asymptomatic FCoV infection (n = 49), 2c) injection-site sarcoma (n = 19), 2d) postvaccination (n = 7), and 2e) specific pathogen free (n = 3). Standard descriptive analyses by group and empirical receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve estimation were performed. Ordinary logistic regression analysis was performed to derive an estimate of the continuous likelihood ratio to produce the posttest probability of disease for any combination of pretest probability and serum AGP value. The comparison of serum AGP levels in the different groups and the analysis of the ROC curve confirmed that serum AGP is a powerful discriminating marker for FIP. The Bayesian approach demonstrated that when the pretest probability of FIP is high, based on history and clinical signs (groups 1 or 2a), moderate serum AGP levels (1.5-2 mg/ml) can discriminate cats with FIP from others, while only high serum AGP levels (>3 mg/ml) can support a diagnosis of FIP in cats with a low pretest probability of disease (groups 2b to 2e).","Paltrinieri, Saverio; Giordano, Alessia; Tranquillo, Vito; Guazzetti, Stefano","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17459855/,593

Initial management with the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug meloxicam and a semisynthetic sodium pentosan polysulfate resulted in clinical improvement and radiographic stabilization of the arthritic condition over several months. However, because pain was still evident, bilateral denervation of the coxofemoral joints was performed, successfully ameliorating the signs of osteoarthritic pain in the tiger. Meloxicam has shown good clinical efficacy for the treatment of osteoarthritis and other painful conditions in large felids. Coxofemoral joint denervation offers many advantages for the treatment of osteoarthritis in exotic carnivore species, and should be considered a viable treatment modality.","Whiteside, Douglas P; Remedios, Audrey M; Black, Sandra R; Finn-Bodner, Susan T",Journal of zoo and wildlife medicine : official publication of the American Association of Zoo Veterinarians,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17319147/,593
252096,CORONA-steps for tracheotomy in COVID-19 patients: A staff-safe method for airway management,2020,"Although fever is one of the main presenting symptoms of COVID-19 infection, little public attention has been given to fever as an evolved defense. Fever, the regulated increase in the body temperature, is part of the evolved systemic reaction to infection known as the acute phase response. The heat of fever augments the performance of immune cells, induces stress on pathogens and infected cells directly, and combines with other stressors to provide a nonspecific immune defense. Observational trials in humans suggest a survival benefit from fever, and randomized trials published before COVID-19 do not support fever reduction in patients with infection. Like public health measures that seem burdensome and excessive, fevers involve costly trade-offs but they can prevent infection from getting out of control. For infections with novel SARS-CoV-2, the precautionary principle applies: unless evidence suggests otherwise, we advise that fever should be allowed to run its course. Lay summary: For COVID-19, many public health organizations have advised treating fever with medicines such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Even though this is a common practice, lowering body temperature has not improved survival in laboratory animals or in patients with infections. Blocking fever can be harmful because fever, along with other sickness symptoms, evolved as a defense against infection. Fever works by causing more damage to pathogens and infected cells than it does to healthy cells in the body. During pandemic COVID-19, the benefits of allowing fever to occur probably outweigh its harms, for individuals and for the public at large. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

407612,Successful Management of COVID-19 Infection in 2 Early Post-Liver Transplant Recipients,2021,"The article introduces the special issue on the COVID-19 pandemic. This special issue on the pandemic is a compilation that began with a Call for Papers and Brief Communications in the summer of 2020. At that time, much of the world was in lockdown, fending off mounting fear and uncertainties, coming to terms with the ramifications of COVID-19 in our personal and professional lives. The learning curves were steep. With no time for reflection, we had to shift therapeutic frames and frames of mind in an attempt to continue to be available, consistent and containing for our patients. A shared trauma unfolded as we simultaneously contended with cares, concerns and anxieties in our own everyday lives. This edition of the journal includes authors from across the globe. They are the voices of cherished psychoanalytic leaders, as well as new voices from pioneering colleagues. Articles describe personal survival in the context of fear and isolation, intimate clinical interactions despite only remote contact, the perseverance of both educators and students, and the ramifications of social uprisings and frightening political unrest. Equally powerful is a collection of briefer reflections in the section entitled, Essays, Meditations and Verse.

442128,Corona-steps for tracheotomy in COVID-19 patients: A staff-safe method for airway management,2020,"BACKGROUND: During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, a rapid screening method for COVID-19 detection is needed to decide the appropriate strategy to treat stroke patients. In acute ischemic stroke treatment, the efficacy and safety of emergent carotid artery stenting (eCAS) for hyperacute ischemic stroke (hAIS) due to internal carotid artery stenosis (ICS) have not been sufficiently established. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 71-year-old man with hAIS caused by severe ICS was treated via intravenous alteplase infusion. The patient underwent screening for COVID-19 by the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay shortly after arrival at our institution. The LAMP result was obtained within 90 minutes, during intravenous alteplase infusion, and turned out to be negative. The symptom of hemiplegia worsened during alteplase infusion, and he, therefore, underwent eCAS after administration of aspirin (200 mg). Recanalization was achieved successfully by eCAS, and dual antiplatelet therapy and argatroban were administrated following eCAS. Hemorrhagic complications or restenosis/occlusion of the carotid artery were not observed. He was discharged without neurologic deficits 15 days following eCAS. Because of the rapid negative diagnosis for COVID-19 using the LAMP method, eCAS could be performed following standard procedures, along with infectious defense, without delay. CONCLUSIONS: This case report suggests that eCAS for hAIS due to ICS following intravenous alteplase can be an effective treatment, along with appropriate antiplatelet medication and management in select patients. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the LAMP assay for COVID-19 detection might be a suitable diagnostic strategy preceding stroke treatment because of the rapid turnaround time.","Michiwaki, Yuhei; Tanaka, Tatsuya; Wakamiya, Tomihiro; Tabei, Yusuke; Samura, Kazuhiro; Suehiro, Eiichi; Kawashima, Masatou",World Neurosurg,,593
621948,CORONA-steps for tracheotomy in COVID-19 patients: a staff-safe method for airway management,2020-05-13,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the long-term evolution of retinal changes in COVID-19 patients with bilateral pneumonia. A total of 17 COVID-19 patients underwent retinal imaging 6 months after hospital discharge with structural optical coherence tomography (OCT) and optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA). The parafoveal retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and ganglion cell layer (GCL) were significantly thinner in COVID-19 patients at 6 months compared to 0 months (p = <0.001 in both cases). In the optic nerve analysis, a significantly thinner RNFL was observed (p = 0.006) but persisted significantly thickened, compared to controls (p = 0.02). The vascular density (VD) at 6 months persisted significantly decreased when compared to the control group, and no significant differences were found with the 0 months evaluation; in addition, when analyzed separately, women showed a worsening in the VD. Moreover, a significantly greater foveal area zone (FAZ) (p = 0.003) was observed in COVID-19 patients at 6 months, compared to 0 months. The cotton wool spots (CWSs) observed at baseline were no longer present at 6 months, except for one patient that developed new ones. This study demonstrates that some of the previously known microvascular alterations resulting from COVID-19, persist over time and are still evident 6 months after hospital discharge in patients who have suffered from bilateral pneumonia.","Bilbao-Malavé, Valentina; González-Zamora, Jorge; Saenz de Viteri, Manuel; de la Puente, Miriam; Gándara, Elsa; Casablanca-Piñera, Anna; Boquera-Ventosa, Claudia; Zarranz-Ventura, Javier; Landecho, Manuel F.; García-Layana, Alfredo",Biomedicines,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34063291/; https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines9050502,593
640452,Abnormal coagulation parameters are associated with poor prognosis in patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia,2020-04-29,"The Coronaviridae are a family of viruses with large RNA genomes. Seven coronaviruses (CoVs) have been shown to infect humans, including the recently emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19). The host response to CoV infection is complex and regulated, in part, by intracellular antiviral signaling pathways triggered in the first cells that are infected. Emerging evidence suggests that CoVs hijack these antiviral responses to reshape the production of interferons and proinflammatory cytokines. Processing bodies (PBs) are membraneless ribonucleoprotein granules that mediate decay or translational suppression of cellular mRNAs; this is particularly relevant for proinflammatory cytokine mRNA which normally reside in PBs and are repressed. Emerging evidence also suggests that PBs or their components play important direct-acting antiviral roles, providing a compelling reason for their frequent disassembly by many viruses. No information is known about how human CoVs impact PBs. Here, we provide data to show that infection with the human CoV, OC43, causes PB disassembly. Moreover, we show that several SARS-CoV-2 gene products also mediate PB loss and virus-induced PB loss correlates with elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokine mRNAs that would normally be repressed in PBs. Finally, we demonstrate that stimulating PB formation prior to OC43 infection restricts viral replication. These data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 and other CoVs disassemble PBs during infection to support viral replication and evade innate immune responses. As an unintended side effect, the disassembly of PBs enhances translation of proinflammatory cytokine mRNAs which normally reside in PBs, thereby reshaping the subsequent immune response.","Robinson, Carolyn-Ann; Kleer, Mariel; Mulloy, Rory P.; Castle, Elizabeth L.; Boudreau, Bre Q.; Corcoran, Jennifer A.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.08.372995,593
654731,CORONA-steps for tracheotomy in COVID-19 patients: A staff-safe method for airway management,2020-04-06,"Background: The occurrence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the associated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have profoundly affected adult kidney disease patients. In contrast, pediatric solid organ transplant recipients, including pediatric kidney transplant (KT) recipients, do not seem to be at particularly higher risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection or for severe COVID-19 disease. This patient population might be protected by certain mechanisms, such as the immunosuppressive medications with their anti-inflammatory properties or simply being well-versed in self-protection techniques. Assessing SARS-CoV-2 antibody serologies could potentially help understand why this patient population is apparently spared from severe SARS-CoV-2 clinical courses. Objective: To examine SARS-CoV-2 serologic status in a cohort of pediatric KT recipients. Methods: SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgG and IgM antibodies were measured by three different methods in pediatric KT recipients coming for routine clinic visits immediately post-confinement in May-June of 2020. The patients were considered seroconverted if SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were positive by 2/3 methods and weak positive/indeterminate if positive by 1/3. Results: Thirty-one patients were evaluated (about 1/3 of our institution's pediatric KT population). One patient seroconverted, while three were considered weak positive/indeterminate. None were symptomatic and none had nasopharyngeal PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 disease. Conclusions: Seroconversion to SARS-CoV-2 was rare in this population and likely reflects the social distancing practiced by these patients. The results will serve as a foundation for a future longitudinal study to evaluate the long-term emergence and persistence of antibodies in this population and may inform studies of response to a future vaccine.","Nailescu, Corina; Khalid, Myda; Wilson, Amy C.; Amanat, Fatima; Arregui, Samuel; Canas, Jorge; Hooks, Jenaya; Krammer, Florian; Schwaderer, Andrew L.; Hains, David S.",Front Pediatr,https://doi.org/10.3389/fped.2020.601327; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33194930/,593
