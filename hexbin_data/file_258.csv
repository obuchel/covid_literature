1039,1039,1039,"Acute care utilization due to hospitalizations for pediatric lower respiratory tract infections in British Columbia, Canada",21.80539,5.017246,2012-12-08,"BACKGROUND: Pediatric LRTI hospitalizations are a significant burden on patients, families, and healthcare systems. This study determined the burden of pediatric LRTIs on hospital settings in British Columbia and the benefits of prevention strategies as they relate to healthcare resource demand. METHODS: LRTI inpatient episodes for patients <19 years of age during 2008–2010 were extracted from the BC Discharge Abstract Database. The annual number of acute care beds required to treat pediatric LRTIs was estimated. Sub-analyses determined the burden due to infants <1 year of age and high-risk infants. Population projections were used to forecast LRTI hospitalizations and the effectiveness of public health initiatives to reduce the incidence of LRTIs to 2020 and 2030. RESULTS: During 2008–2010, LRTI as the primary diagnosis accounted for 32.0 and 75.9% hospitalizations for diseases of the respiratory system in children <19 years of age and infants <1 year of age, respectively. Infants <1 year of age accounted for 47 and 77% hospitalizations due to pediatric LRTIs and pediatric LRTI hospitalizations specifically due to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), respectively. The average length of stay was 3.1 days for otherwise healthy infants <1 year of age and 9.1 days for high-risk infants (P <0.0001). 73.1% pediatric LRTI hospitalizations occurred between November and April. Over the study timeframe, 19.6 acute care beds were required on average to care for pediatric LRTIs which increased to 64.0 beds at the peak of LRTI hospitalizations. Increases in LRTI bed-days of 5.5 and 16.2% among <19 year olds by 2020 and 2030, respectively, were predicted. Implementation of appropriate prevention strategies could cause 307 and 338 less LRTI hospitalizations in <19 year olds in 2020 and 2030, respectively. CONCLUSION: Pediatric LRTI hospitalizations require significant use of acute care infrastructure particularly between November and April. Population projections show the burden may increase in the next 20 years, but implementation of effective public health prevention strategies may contribute to reducing the acute care demand and to supporting efforts for overall pediatric healthcare sustainability.","Santibanez, Pablo; Gooch, Katherine; Vo, Pamela; Lorimer, Michelle; Sandino, Yurik",BMC Health Serv Res,258,5

The knowledge about DSN is very important for the reporting of notifiable diseases. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to examine the awareness and knowledge of health-care workers about DSN, and availability of facility records in Anambra State, Nigeria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was a descriptive cross-sectional one in which relevant data were collected from health-care workers selected by a multistage sampling technique. Qualitative information was also elicited by key informant interviews, whereas an observational checklist, preceded by a desk review was used to examine the availability of facility records. RESULTS: Although 89.8% of the health-care workers were aware of the DSN system, only 33.3, 31.1, and 33.7% of them knew the specific uses of forms IDSR 001, IDSR 002, and IDSR 003 (IDSR: Integrated Diseases Surveillance and Response), respectively. Knowledge of use of the various forms at the facility and local government area (LGA) levels were generally low, although the observational checklist revealed that IDSR 001 and IDSR 002 forms were predominantly found in primary health-care facilities. HMIS forms were less likely to be available in secondary health-care facilities (χ(2)=7.67, P=0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Regular training and retraining of concerned health-care workers on DSN at the LGA level is recommended. This should run concurrently with adequate and regular provision of IDSR forms, copies of the standard case definitions, and other necessary logistics to the health-care facilities by the local and state governments.","Nnebue, Chinomnso C.; Onwasigwe, Chika N.; Adogu, Prosper O.

We analyzed the role of their pulmonary images in predicting the severity and diagnosis of the disease. METHODS: Among 97 patients with confirmed novel H1N1 infection, 42 patients treated with mechanical ventilation formed group 1, and the remaining 55 patients constituted group 2. The initial and subsequent radiograhic findings in groups 1 and 2 were compared with respect to the pattern, distribution, and extent of the abnormality. RESULTS: In group 1, 24 patients presented with three or more lung zone diseases, whereas only 5 patients in group 2 demonstrated these findings (P<0.001). A pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax was observed in 24/42 patients in group 1 and in 18/55 patients in group 2 (P=0.019). Twelve patients in group 1 and 5 in group 2 developed a ground-glass opacity cyst with a honeycomb appearance (P=0.007). CONCLUSIONS: The most common radiographic and computed tomography findings in children who were severely infected with S-OIV included unilateral or bilateral ground-glass opacities with or without associated focal or multifocal areas of consolidation. Children with bilateral involvement or with greater opacity on the chest radiographs were more likely to worsen and require the mechanical ventilation.","Xu, Wei; Liu, Chun-Feng; Zhao, Ying; Li, Jiu-Jun; Wang, Li-Jie; Wen, Guang-Fu; Liu, Zhe",World J Pediatr,258,30

DESIGN: Prospective descriptive study, without intervention. METHOD: Patients with respiratory illnesses were evaluated by a directed history and physical examination. Nasopharyngeal secretions for viral culture were obtained, and acute and convalescent serum samples were obtained for analysis. Serologic evidence of infection with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and parainfluenza were determined by enzyme immunoassay (EIA), and influenza by hemagglutination‐inhibition assay and EIA. SETTING: A 591‐bed nursing home. PARTICIPANTS: Residents with signs or symptoms of acute respiratory illness (nasal congestion, pharyngitis, cough, wheezing, or respiratory difficulty) were eligible for study. RESULTS: A viral etiology was documented in 62 out of 149 illnesses (42%). RSV was the most common virus associated with illness; it was documented in 27% of respiratory illnesses, followed by rhinovirus (9%), parainfluenza (6%), and influenza (1%). RSV was associated with significantly more severe disease when compared with rhinovirus. Clustering of specific viral infections occurred, suggesting nosocomial transmission. CONCLUSIONS: Viruses are an important cause of acute respiratory infections in the institutionalized elderly during the winter months.","Falsey, Ann R.; Treanor, John J.; Betts, Robert F.; Walsh, Edward E.",J Am Geriatr Soc,258,5

The process for discharging these children from hospital to home is not yet optimal. The overall goal of this project was to develop recommendations to be included in a provincial strategy to support transitions in care for children with complex and medically fragile needs. METHODS: A wide assortment of stakeholders participated in this mixed method, multiphase project. During Phase 1, data was gathered from a range of sources to document families’ experiences transitioning from an inpatient hospital stay back to their home communities. In Phase 2, pediatricians, nurses, and health administrators participated in key stakeholder interviews to identify barriers and facilitators to a successful transition in care for children and families with complex care needs. A multi-sector consensus meeting was held during Phase 3 to discuss study findings and refine key recommendations for inclusion in a provincial strategy. RESULTS: Six case studies were developed involving children and families discharged home with a variety of complex care needs. Children ranged in age from 15 days to 9 years old. Nine telephone interviews were conducted in Phase 2 with pediatricians, nurses, and administrators from across the province. A variety of inter-institutional communication challenges were described as a major barrier to the transition process. A consistent message across all interviews was the need for improved coordination to facilitate transitions in care. The consensus meeting to review study findings included physicians, nurses, paramedics, senior administrators, and policy analysts from different health and government sectors and resulted in six recommendations for inclusion in a provincial strategy. CONCLUSIONS: This project identified policy and practice gaps that currently exist related to transitions in care for children with complex and medically fragile needs and their families. Our collaborative patient-centred approach to understanding how children and families currently navigate transitions in care provided a foundation for developing recommendations for a provincial wide strategy.","Curran, Janet A.; Breneol, Sydney; Vine, Jocelyn",BMC Pediatr,258,5

Here, we report a new molecular glue HQ461 discovered by high-throughput screening. Using loss-of-function and gain-of-function genetic screening in human cancer cells followed by biochemical reconstitution, we show that HQ461 acts by promoting an interaction between CDK12 and DDB1-CUL4-RBX1 E3 ubiquitin ligase, leading to polyubiquitination and degradation of CDK12-interacting protein Cyclin K (CCNK). Degradation of CCNK mediated by HQ461 compromised CDK12 function, leading to reduced phosphorylation of a CDK12 substrate, downregulation of DNA damage response genes, and cell death. Structure-activity relationship analysis of HQ461 revealed the importance of a 5-methylthiazol-2-amine pharmacophore and resulted in an HQ461 derivate with improved potency. Our studies reveal a new molecular glue that recruits its target protein directly to DDB1 to bypass the requirement of a substrate-specific receptor, presenting a new strategy for targeted protein degradation.","Lv, Lu; Chen, Peihao; Cao, Longzhi; Li, Yamei; Zeng, Zhi; Cui, Yue; Wu, Qingcui; Li, Jiaojiao; Wang, Jian-Hua; Dong, Meng-Qiu; Qi, Xiangbing; Han, Ting",,258,5

Four cattle with 100 ± 5.0 kg body weight were used in this study. A 2 × 2 factorial experiment in a 4 × 4 Latin square design was conducted, in which factor A was the CP levels in concentrate of 14% and 16% of dry matter (DM) and factor B was the supplement levels of SG at 0.4% and 0.6% DM intake, respectively. The results showed that the CP content in concentrate and SG supplementation had no interaction effect on intake, digestibility, ruminal ecologies, ruminal fermentation products, and nitrogen utilization. Increasing CP content to 16% significantly (p < 0.05) increased the ruminal ammonia nitrogen (NH(3)-N), nitrogen (N) intake, N absorption, and N retention. SG supplementation significantly (p < 0.05) decreased CP digestibility, NH(3)-N, blood urea nitrogen, and protozoa. In addition, SG significantly decreased acetate (C2), acetate to propionate ratio, methane, and fecal N excretion, while it significantly increased total volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and propionate (C3) concentration.

In past years, the human intestinal microbial composition (microbiota) has been found to be associated with various disease states, including cancer, response to cancer immunotherapy and to modulate the gut innate and adaptive immune response. In the setting of allo-HSCT, the intestinal microbiota diversity and composition appear to have an impact on infection risk, mortality and overall survival. Microbial metabolites have been shown to contribute to the health and integrity of intestinal epithelial cells during inflammation, thus mitigating graft-versus-host disease in animal models. While the cause-andeffect relationship between the intestinal microbiota and transplant-associated complications has not yet been fully elucidated, the above findings have already resulted in the implementation of various interventions aiming to restore the intestinal microbiota diversity and composition. Among others, these interventions include the administration of fecal microbiota transplantation. The present review, based on published data, is intended to define the role of the latter approach in the setting of allo-HSCT.","Henig, Israel; Yehudai-Ofir, Dana; Zuckerman, Tsila",Haematologica,258,5

The objective of this study was to detail the longitudinal, quasi-experimental work that spans 5 years to describe outcomes across RE-AIM (reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance) dimensions of integrating a physical activity intervention for older adults into the Cooperative Extension System through the assess, plan, do, evaluate, report (APDER) cycle. INTERVENTION APPROACH: The participant-level intervention is Lifelong Improvements through Fitness Together (LIFT), an 8-week, group dynamics-based, strength-training program with 16 in-person sessions. The implementation intervention applies the iterative APDER cycle based on feedback for each dimension of RE-AIM. Each year, the APDER cycle was used to embed data collection procedures at the instructor and participant level to reveal the next evolution of the program. EVALUATION METHODS: Each evolution of LIFT was measured through a pretest and posttest quasi-experimental design. Data were collected on each RE-AIM dimension through participant surveys and functional fitness assessments, number and representativeness of trainees, and process evaluation. RESULTS: Overall, LIFT was expanded to 4 states with 275 instructors, reaching 816 older adults; consistently improved functional fitness outcome measures; demonstrated strong program adherence; and was seen as feasible and enjoyable by instructors and participants. LIFT is now undergoing adaptations for virtual delivery as well as updating the exercise protocol to introduce yoga postures that target flexibility and balance. IMPLICATIONS FOR PUBLIC HEALTH: Overall, ongoing adaptations were necessary to ensure the program continued to fit the mission, values, and resources of the delivery system. Public health implications to support the need for ongoing adaptation include embedding pragmatic measures of adaptations and RE-AIM into standard evaluation pathways and using iterative APDER cycles.","Harden, Samantha M.; Balis, Laura E.; Strayer, Thomas; Wilson, Meghan L.",Prev Chronic Dis,258,5

Opioid analgesics are among the most frequently prescribed drugs by dentists. An estimated 5 million people undergo third-molar extractions in the United States each year, resulting in postoperative pain. Studies show that, in most cases, the combination of ibuprofen and acetaminophen is an effective alternative to commonly prescribed opioid analgesics for the management of postextraction pain. Nevertheless, many dentists routinely prescribe opioids after dental extractions. OBJECTIVE: We describe the rationale, design, and methods for a randomized trial of interventions designed to de-implement opioid prescribing by dentists while implementing effective nonopioid analgesics following dental extractions. METHODS: Using a prospective, 3-arm, cluster randomized trial design with dentists as the unit randomized and patient-level prescribing data as the primary outcome, we will compare different strategies to reduce the reliance on opioids and increase the use of alternative pain management approaches utilizing information support tools aimed at both providers and their patients. The study will test the efficacy of 2 interventions to decrease opioid prescribing following dental extractions: clinical decision support with (CDS-E) and without patient education (CDS). Providers will be randomized to CDS, CDS-E, or standard practice. Patient-level outcomes will be determined via review of comprehensive electronic health records. We will compare study arms on differential change in prescribing patterns from pre- to postimplementation of the intervention. The primary outcome of interest is a binary indicator of whether or not the patient received an opioid prescription on the day of the extraction encounter. We will also examine recommendations or prescriptions for nonopioid analgesics, patients’ perceptions of shared decision making, and patients’ pain experiences following the extraction. RESULTS: The HealthPartners Institutional Review Board approved the study. All study materials including the CDS and patient education materials have been developed and pilot tested, and the protocol has been approved by the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research. The intervention was implemented in February 2020, with 51 dentists who were randomized to 1 of the 3 arms. CONCLUSIONS: If the intervention strategies are shown to be effective, they could be implemented more broadly in dental settings with high levels of opioid prescribing.

However, culturally tailored interventions for this population have been slow to emerge. OBJECTIVE: This type 1 effectiveness-implementation trial examines the feasibility and efficacy of a gamified, culturally tailored, personalized normative feedback (PNF) alcohol intervention for sexual minority women who psychologically identify as lesbian, bisexual, or queer (LBQ). METHODS: The core components of a PNF intervention were delivered within LezParlay, a fun, social media–inspired, digital competition designed to challenge negative stereotypes about LBQ women and increase visibility. The competition was advertised on the web through social media platforms and collaboration with LBQ community organizations. After 2 rounds of play by a large cohort of LBQ women, a subsample of 500 drinkers already taking part in the competition were invited to participate in the evaluation study. Study participants were randomized to receive 1 of 3 unique sequences of PNF (ie, alcohol and stigma coping, alcohol and control, or control topics only) over 2 intervention rounds. Randomization was fully automated by the web app, and both researchers and participants were blinded. RESULTS: Analyses will evaluate whether PNF on alcohol use reduces participants’ drinking and negative consequences at 2 and 4 months postintervention; examine whether providing PNF on stigma-coping behaviors, in addition to alcohol use, further reduces alcohol use and consequences beyond PNF on alcohol alone; identify mediators and moderators of intervention efficacy; and examine broader LezParlay app engagement, acceptability, and perceived benefits. CONCLUSIONS: This incognito intervention approach is uniquely oriented toward engaging and preventing alcohol-related risks among community populations of LBQ women who may view their heavy drinking as normative and not in need of change because of the visibility of alcohol use in sexual minority community spaces. Thus, this intervention strategy diverges from, and is intended to complement, more intensive programs being developed to meet the needs of LBQ women already motivated to reduce their consumption.

Accumulation of these chemicals has adverse effects on human health, including inflammation in multiple organs, yet how PFAS are sensed by host cells, and how tissue inflammation eventually incurs, is still unclear. Here, we show that the double-stranded DNA receptor AIM2 is able to recognize perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), a common form of PFAS, to trigger IL-1β secretion and pyroptosis. Mechanistically, PFOS activates the AIM2 inflammasome in a process involving mitochondrial DNA release through the Ca(2+)-PKC-NF-κB/JNK-BAX/BAK axis. Accordingly, Aim2(−/−) mice have reduced PFOS-induced inflammation, as well as tissue damage in the lungs, livers, and kidneys in both their basic condition and in an asthmatic exacerbation model. Our results thus suggest a function of AIM2 in PFOS-mediated tissue inflammation, and identify AIM2 as a major pattern recognition receptor in response to the environmental organic pollutants.","Wang, Li-Qiu; Liu, Tao; Yang, Shuai; Sun, Lin; Zhao, Zhi-Yao; Li, Li-Yue; She, Yuan-Chu; Zheng, Yan-Yan; Ye, Xiao-Yan; Bao, Qing; Dong, Guang-Hui; Li, Chun-Wei; Cui, Jun",Nat Commun,258,12

In 2002, the American Thoracic Society (ATS) developed guidelines on standardising the implementation of the 6MWT. Despite the relative ease of conducting the 6MWT as per these guidelines, adaptations are implemented. OBJECTIVES: Identify (1) what 6MWT adaptations to the ATS guidelines have been described in low-resource settings (LRS), (2) the purpose of the adapted 6MWT and (3) the reported argumentation for making these adaptations in relation to the specific context. METHODS: Five databases were searched from inception until February 2021. Studies that adapted and conducted the 6MWT in LRS were included. Data concerning the study source, participants, 6MWT: purpose, variations, outcome and rationale were extracted. RESULTS: A total of 24 studies were included. The majority of studies (n = 18; 75%) were conducted in lower-middle income countries. The most common adaptation implemented was variation to course length. Eight studies provided a rationale for adapting the 6MWT. Space constraint was the most common reason for adaptation. CONCLUSION: The most common reason (space constraints) for adapting the 6MWT in LRS was addressed through adaptations in course length and/or configuration. The results of this review suggest that the value of the ATS-guided 6MWT in LRS may need to be re-evaluated. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Using adapted forms of the 6MWT may lead to an underestimation of a patient’s abilities, misinformed discharge and developing inappropriate exercise programmes. Additionally, diverting from ATS guidelines may affect the continuity of care.","Fell, Brittany L.; Hanekom, Susan; Heine, Martin",S Afr J Physiother,258,5

DATA SOURCES: Five key databases (Ovid Medline, Embase, Scopus, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) Plus, and Web of Science), from inception through to January 2019, reference lists, and opportunistically identified publications. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Research articles containing direct first-person quotations by CADs (aged 0–18 years inclusive) describing how they experienced HCPs. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Tabulation of study characteristics, contextual information, and verbatim extraction of all ‘relevant’ (as defined above) direct quotations. Analysis of basic scope of the evidence base. The research team worked reflexively and collaboratively to interpret the qualitative data and construct a synthesis of children’s experiences. To consolidate and elaborate the interpretation, we held two focus groups with inpatient CADs in a children’s hospital. RESULTS: 669 quotations from 99 studies described CADs’ experiences of HCPs. Favourable experiences were of forming trusting relationships and being involved in healthcare discussions and decisions; less favourable experiences were of not relating to or being unable to trust HCPs and/or being excluded from conversations about them. HCPs fostered trusting relationships by being personable, wise, sincere and relatable. HCPs made CADs feel involved by including them in conversations, explaining medical information, and listening to CADs’ wider needs and preferences. CONCLUSION: These findings strengthen the case for making CADs partners in healthcare despite their youth. We propose that a criterion for high-quality child-centred healthcare should be that HCPs communicate in ways that engender trust and involvement.","Davison, Gail; Kelly, Martina Ann; Conn, Richard; Thompson, Andrew; Dornan, Tim",BMJ Open,258,17

Finally, two groups of mice were continuously treated twice per week from week 2 to 16 with either the Lactobacillus plantarum (Lac CC group) or S. thermophilus (Strep CC group) bacterial strain pre-and post-treatment as performed for the CC group. Remarkably, Tlr2, Ifng, Il4, Il13, Il10, and Tp53 transcription were significantly downregulated in the Strep CC intestinal mucosa group. Additionally, IL2 expression was decreased significantly in the Strep CC mouse serum, whereas TNFα was remarkably elevated compared to that in the CC, Lac CC, and untreated groups. This study suggested that Streptococcus thermophilus did not interrupt or hinder colon cancer development in mice when administered as a prophylactic.","Hadad, Sahar EL; Alsolami, Maha; Aldahlawi, Alia; Alrahimi, Jehan; Basingab, Fatemah; Hassoubah, Shahira; Alothaid, Hani",Saudi J Biol Sci,258,5

The aim of this study was to demonstrate the relationship of NLR and MLR with the severity of myocarditis. 202 consecutive patients with myocarditis were retrospectively enrolled in this study. Laboratory parameters and clinical data were extracted from hospital records and discharge letters. Median NLR was 2.48 (IQR 1.55–4.58) and median MLR was 0.42 (IQR 0.39–0.58). NLR and MLR correlated with HF, CRP and leukocyte count, MLR further correlated inversely with LV systolic function (rs = − 0.379, p = 0.030). Both ratios correlated better with length of hospital stay (NLR: rs = 0.435, p = 0.003; MLR: rs = 0.534, p < 0.0001) than CRP, leukocyte count, IL-6 or procalcitonin. AUCs for the prediction of prolonged hospital stay (NLR = 0.75, MLR = 0.80), and optimal cut-offs therefor were calculated. Patients who had in-hospital complications showed a higher NLR, however, this remained statistically insignificant. NLR and MLR correlated with the length of stay, as well as with several clinical and laboratory parameters in patients with myocarditis. Since white blood cell differentials are relatively easy and fast to perform, both ratios could facilitate further risk stratification in affected patients.","Mirna, Moritz; Schmutzler, Lukas; Topf, Albert; Hoppe, Uta C.; Lichtenauer, Michael",Sci Rep,258,17

Therefore, we aimed to propose a nomogram to identify patients who would benefit from CC. METHODS: A total of 434 NPC patients (stage II–IVa) treated with IC followed by IMRT between January 2010 and December 2015 were included. There were 808 dosimetric parameters extracted by the in-house script for each patient. A dosimetric signature was developed with the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator algorithm. A nomogram was built by incorporating clinical factors and dosimetric signature using Cox regression to predict recurrence-free survival (RFS). The C-index was used to evaluate the performance of the nomogram. The patients were stratified into low- and high-risk recurrence according to the optimal cutoff of risk score. RESULTS: The nomogram incorporating age, TNM stage, and dosimetric signature yielded a C-index of 0.719 (95% confidence interval, 0.658–0.78). In the low-risk group, CC was associated with a 9.4% increase of 5-year locoregional RFS and an 8.8% increase of 5-year overall survival (OS), whereas it was not significantly associated with an improvement of locoregional RFS (LRFS) and OS in the high-risk group. However, in the high-risk group, patients could benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy (AC) by improving 33.6% of the 5-year LRFS. CONCLUSIONS: The nomogram performed an individualized risk quantification of RFS in patients with stage II–IVa NPC treated with IC followed by IMRT. Patients with low risk could benefit from CC, whereas patients with high risk may require additional AC.","Yang, Kaixuan; Zhang, Qian; Zhang, Mengxi; Xie, Wenji; Li, Mei; Zeng, Lei; Wang, Qiang; Zhao, Jianling; Li, Yiping; Li, Guangjun",Front Oncol,258,27

This patient population previously experienced suboptimal outcomes with interferon-based regimens. Unfortunately, patients aged 65 years and older were underrepresented in phase 2 and 3 clinical trials with newer direct acting antiviral (DAA) therapies. Since the advent of second-generation DAA in 2013, numerous robust real-world experiences highlighting the efficacy and safety of DAA in the elderly have been published. This review article summarizes the cascade of care for hepatitis C from diagnosis to cure from an evidence-based perspective of the aging population. RECENT FINDING: In a large study from the Veterans Affairs Healthcare System, the overall sustained virologic response (SVR) of 15,884 patients treated with DAA regimens was 91.2%. These newer therapies remained highly effective in the subset of patients aged 65 years and older with SVR rates above 90%. A Spanish National Registry reported outcomes in patients ≥ 65 years old treated for HCV with oral DAA regimens over a 2-year period. The overall SVR was 94% in the study of 1252 subjects. SUMMARY: Current real-world data imply DAA treatment regimens remain highly effective and safe in elderly patients when compared to the general population.","Mohammed Abdul, Mubeen Khan; Snyder, Heather S.; Chunduru, Mythili; Lee, Susan M.K.; Satapathy, Sanjaya K.",Curr Treat Options Infect Dis,258,5

This study aims to investigate the pathogenesis of RP in dairy cows by plasma metabolomics. As subjects, 10 dairy cows with RP and 10 healthy dairy cows were enrolled according to strict enrollment criteria. Imbalanced antioxidant capacity, reduced Th1/Th2 cytokine ratio, and deregulation of total bilirubin (T-bil), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and reproductive hormones were shown in dairy cows with RP by detecting biochemical indicators, oxidation and antioxidant markers, and cytokines in serum. Plasma metabolites were detected and analyzed by a liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS) system coupled with multivariate statistical analysis software. A total of 23 potential biomarkers were uncovered in the plasma of dairy cows with RP. The metabolic pathways involved in these potential biomarkers are interconnected, and the conversion, utilization, and excretion of nitrogen were disturbed in dairy cows with RP. Moreover, these potential biomarkers are involved in the regulation of antioxidant capacity, inflammation, and autocrine or paracrine hormone. All of these findings suggest that an imbalance of these potential biomarkers might be responsible for the imbalanced antioxidant capacity, reduced Th1/Th2 cytokine ratio, and deregulation of reproductive hormones in dairy cows with RP. The regulation of metabolic pathways involved in these potential biomarkers represents a promising therapeutic strategy for RP.","Li, Yuqiong; Zhao, Zhengwei; Yu, Yang; Liang, Xiaojun; Wang, Shengyi; Wang, Lei; Cui, Dongan; Huang, Meizhou",Front Vet Sci,258,3

The potential of this intervention program was assessed by effectiveness and cost measures using suitable statistical analyses. We compared the effectiveness and cost measures of this ambulant psychiatric rehabilitation program on patients for the period of up to 12 months after discharge to the period of 12 months before admission to the intervention program based on self-reported catamnesis questionnaires. For the program’s effectiveness measures, we accounted for both psychological indices for measuring depression severity, symptom burden, and functioning to document the health improvement of patients and economy-related indices such as the number of sick leave days for patients. For the program’s cost measures, both direct tangible treatment and medication costs and indirect tangible costs based on the productivity loss measured in non-working days of the patients were considered. The results significantly demonstrated that all psychological effectiveness measures for the patients highly improved by the 6-weeks rehabilitation program and remained rather stable 12 months after discharge. We found that costs for the 6-week ambulant psychiatric rehabilitation program could be easily covered within 12 months after discharge once a total societal cost perspective was considered. Even additional total cost savings of up to over 5000 Euro could be achieved which were highest for employed patients, followed by unemployed patients receiving rehabilitation allowance due to both their high direct medication and treatment costs as well as high indirect costs for productivity loss. The most important finding was that this treatment program was especially beneficial for rehabilitation patients in earlier stages of psychiatric diseases who were still employed, indicating the need for early intervention in mental disorder.","Schosser, Alexandra; Senft, Birgit; Rauner, Marion",Cent Eur J Oper Res,258,1

One possible method for increasing assay sensitivity for detecting changes in pain intensity is to increase the reliability of pain intensity assessment by increasing the number of intensity ratings obtained, and combining these ratings into composite scores. The current study performed secondary analyses from a published clinical trial to test this possibility. The reliability and assay sensitivity pain intensity scores made up of 1 to 9 24-hour pain intensity recall ratings were compared. Although the reliability of the outcome measures improved as the number of items increased, this increase in reliability was not associated with an increase in assay sensitivity. A single 24-hour recall rating was about as valid (sensitive) for detecting treatment effects as composite scores made up of 2 to 9 different ratings. If this finding replicates in other pain populations, it has significant implications for the design and conduct of pain clinical trials. Specifically, it suggests the possibility that assessment burden (and associated costs and problems related to missing data) might be greatly reduced by specifying a single recall rating as the primary outcome variable. Research is needed to explore this possibility further.","Jensen, Mark P; Hu, Xiaojun; Potts, Susan L; Gould, Errol M",Pain,258,16

Transcranial magnetic stimulation and diffusion weight imaging indexed structure and function of the corticospinal tract and corpus callosum. Separate models of the relationship between possible biomarkers and motor outcomes at a single chronic (≥6 months) time point post stroke were performed. Results Age (ΔR20.365, p = 0.017) and ipsilesional-transcallosal inhibition (ΔR20.182, p = 0.048) explained a 54.7% (p = 0.009) variance in paretic WMFT-rate.

Obtaining a U.S. PEDV isolate that can grow efficiently in cell culture is critical for investigating pathogenesis and developing diagnostic assays and for vaccine development. An additional objective was to determine which gene(s) of PEDV is most suitable for studying the genetic relatedness of the virus. Here we describe two PEDV isolates (ISU13-19338E and ISU13-22038) successfully obtained from the small intestines of piglets from sow farms in Indiana and Iowa, respectively. The two isolates have been serially propagated in cell culture for over 30 passages and were characterized for the first 10 passages. Virus production in cell culture was confirmed by PEDV-specific real-time reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR), immunofluorescence assays, and electron microscopy. The infectious titers of the viruses during the first 10 passages ranged from 6 × 10(2) to 2 × 10(5) 50% tissue culture infective doses (TCID50)/ml. In addition, the full-length genome sequences of six viruses (ISU13-19338E homogenate, P3, and P9; ISU13-22038 homogenate, P3, and P9) were determined. Genetically, the two PEDV isolates were relatively stable during the first 10 passages in cell culture. Sequences were also compared to those of 4 additional U.S. PEDV strains and 23 non-U.S. strains. All U.S. PEDV strains were genetically closely related to each other (≥99.7% nucleotide identity) and were most genetically similar to Chinese strains reported in 2011 to 2012.

Moreover, laparoscopic surgery performed with needlescopic instruments has more advantages than conventional laparoscopic surgery. However, there are few reports of large-scale laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal inguinal hernia repair using needlescopic instruments (nTAPP). This report reviews our experiences with 352 nTAPP in 317 patients during the 15-year period from April 1996 to April 2011. METHODS We performed nTAPP as the method of choice in 88.5% of all patients presenting with inguinal hernia. To perform the nTAPP, 3-mm instruments were used. A 5-mm laparoscope was inserted from the umbilicus, and surgical instruments were inserted through 5- and 3-mm trocars. After reduction of the hernia sac and dissection of the preperitoneal space, we placed polyester mesh or polypropylene soft mesh with staple fixation. The peritoneum was closed with 3-0 silk interrupted sutures. RESULTS The mean operative time was 102.9 min for unilateral hernias and 155.8 min for bilateral hernias. There was no conversion to open repair. Forty-three patients (13.6%) used postoperative analgesics, and the mean frequency of use was 0.5 times. Regarding intraoperative complications, we observed one bladder injury, but no bowel injuries or major vessel injuries. Postoperative complications occurred in 32 patients (10.1%). One patient with a retained lipoma required reoperation. There was no incidence of chronic pain or mesh infection. The operative time for experienced surgeons (≥ 20 repairs) was significantly shorter than that of inexperienced surgeons (< 20 repairs; P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS The nTAPP was a safe and useful technique for inguinal hernia repair. Large prospective, randomized controlled trials will be required to establish the benefit of nTAPP.","Wada, Hidetoshi; Kimura, Taizo; Kawabe, Akihiro; Sato, Masanori; Miyaki, Yuichirou; Tochikubo, Junpei; Inamori, Kouji; Shiiya, Norihiko",Surgical endoscopy,258,1

However, numerous studies have shown that the presence of donor-reactive memory T cells in the recipient poses a sometimes insurmountable barrier to long-term graft survival and tolerance induction. Here, we discuss the ways in which donor-reactive memory T cells may arise from environmental exposure to pathogens. Pathogen-specific memory T cells, by virtue of the inherent degeneracy of T-cell receptor recognition of peptide:major histocompatibility complex ligands, may exhibit cross reactivity with allogeneic peptide:major histocompatibility complexes and thereby mediate graft rejection. From the recent explosion in knowledge of the heterogeneity of memory T-cell resulting from variations in frequency and duration of antigen exposure, cytokine milieu, site of priming, and a host of other factors, it is becoming increasingly well appreciated that different memory T-cell populations may exhibit differential susceptibilities to tolerance induction. Thus, the immune history of a transplant recipient and frequencies of donor-cross-reactive memory T cells within the various compartments may dictate the likelihood of success or failure of tolerance induction.","Ford, Mandy L; Kirk, Allan D; Larsen, Christian P",Transplantation,258,31

Selective, intracarotid blood cooling may initiate rapid and early brain hypothermia, reduce systemic effects, and allow combined endovascular mechanical thrombectomy. For this approach, a balloon cooling catheter system was designed and studied in vitro to optimize its cooling performance. MATERIALS AND METHODS Computational fluid dynamics of blood cooling was performed within the common carotid artery lumen by using 3 different catheter designs (1-, 2-, and 4-balloon array). On the basis of these results, a first catheter prototype was manufactured, and its heat-exchange performance was tested in an artificial in vitro circulation simulating the common carotid artery lumen at different flow rates (inflow temperature of 37°C). RESULTS In the computational fluid dynamics model, the catheter with the 4-balloon array achieved the highest cooling rate of -1.6°C, which may be attributed to disruption of the thermal boundary layers. In the in vitro study, cooling of the blood substitute at flow rates of 400 mL/min (normal common carotid artery flow) and 250 mL/min (reduced common carotid artery flow due to distal MCA occlusion) achieved a temperature drop inside the blood substitute along the cooling balloons of -1.6°C and -2.2°C, respectively. CONCLUSIONS The feasibility of intracarotid blood cooling using a new catheter system was demonstrated in vitro. A serial 4-balloon array led to an optimized cooling capacity approaching optimum target temperatures of mild therapeutic hypothermia. To determine the therapeutic efficacy of combined selective therapeutic hypothermia and mechanical thrombectomy, further in vivo studies by using a model of temporary ischemia with large-vessel occlusion and recanalization are required.","Cattaneo, G; Schumacher, M; Wolfertz, J; Jost, T; Meckel, S",AJNR.

Because of the large number of cultivars, it is necessary to prioritize extracts before proceeding to clinical trials. Purpose To compare extracts of two unique cannabis cultivars (CT-921, CT-928) for treatment of neuropathic pain induced by constriction of sciatic nerve in mice and to illustrate the use of this animal model to set priority for future trials. Methods Pain severity was measured by threshold force causing paw withdrawal. Dose-response relationships and time course were determined for intravenously injected extracts of cultivars and vehicle. The doses for allodynia relief were correlated with decreased respiratory rate, temperature and behavioral changes. Results Effective analgesic dose for 50 and 95% (ED50An and ED95An) was 15, and 29 mg/kg for CT-921 and 0.9 and 4.7 for CT-928. At ED50An, for both extracts, the duration was 120 min. At ED95An, administration of CT-928 significantly decreased respiratory rate while CT-921 did not. CT-928 decreased temperature more than CT-921. CT-928 produced frantic hyperactivity not seen with CT-921. At equivalent analgesic doses, THC was much less in CT-921 than in CT-928 suggesting interactions with components other than THC influenced the analgesia. At equivalent analgesic doses, efficacy-to-adverse effect profile for CT-928 was worse than for CT-921. Conclusion Both extracts relieved neuropathic pain; however, CT-921 had a better efficacy-to-adverse effect profile, a rational basis for prioritizing cultivars for future clinical evaluation.","Rouhollahi, Elham; MacLeod, Bernard A; Barr, Alasdair M; Puil, Ernest","Drug design, development and therapy",258,25

In arthropods, they are generally viewed as parasites while in nematodes they appear to be mutualists although this demarcation is not absolute. Their presence in arthropods generally leads to reproductive anomalies, while in nematodes, they are generally required for worm development and reproduction. In mosquitos, Wolbachia inhibit RNA viral infections, leading to populational reductions in human RNA virus pathogens, whereas in filarial nematodes, their requirement for worm fertility and survival has been channeled into their use as drug targets for filariasis control. While much more research on these ubiquitous symbionts is needed, they are viewed as playing significant roles in biological processes, ranging from arthropod speciation to human health.","Lefoulon, Emilie; Foster, Jeremy M; Truchon, Alex; Carlow, C K S; Slatko, Barton E",Results and problems in cell differentiation,258,6

METHODS Descriptive study with association. Skeletal class measured by the Steiner method. Postural analysis through APECS mobile application for forward head posture and shoulder discrepancy, and surface electromyography with Biopac® device. RESULTS The skeletal class, forward head posture, and shoulder discrepancy presented statistical association with the symmetrical electromyographic response of digastric muscles and masseter muscles during swallowing. DISCUSSION This study exhibited a positive relationship between digastric muscle symmetry and skeletal class during swallowing. The compensation of the hyoid system explains these results, showing that skeletal Class III has better electromyographic balance. In contrast, masseter muscle symmetry during swallowing presented a negative relationship with skeletal class. The stabilization role that this muscle plays during swallowing explains these findings, caused by the different lengths and direction of this muscle in skeletal Class III.","Espinoza, Sebastián; Peirano, Gabriela; Tapia, Nancy; Venega, Patricia; Marfull, Norman",Cranio : the journal of craniomandibular practice,258,1

Most elderly patients with CKD5 may only have two treatment options: dialysis or conservative kidney management (CKM). The objective of this systematic review was to investigate whether CKM offers a quantity or quality of life benefit compared to dialysis for some patients with CKD5. METHODS The databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and CINAHL were systematically searched for studies comparing patients with CKD5 who had chosen or were treated with either CKM or dialysis. The primary outcomes were mortality and quality of life (QoL). Hospitalization, symptom burden, and place of death were secondary outcomes. For studies reporting hazard ratios, pooled values were calculated, and forest plots conducted. RESULTS Twenty-five primary studies, all observational, were identified. All studies reported an increased mortality in patients treated with CKM (pooled hazard ratio 0.47, 95 % confidence interval 0.34-0.65). For patients aged ≥ 80 years and for elderly individuals with comorbidities, results were ambiguous. In most studies, CKM seemed advantageous for QoL and secondary outcomes. Findings were limited by the heterogeneity of studies and biased outcomes favouring dialysis. CONCLUSIONS In general, patients with CKD5 who have chosen or are on CKM live for a shorter time than patients who have chosen or are on dialysis. In patients aged ≥ 80 years old, and in elderly individuals with comorbidities, the survival benefits of dialysis seem to be lost. Regarding QoL, symptom burden, hospitalization, and place of death, CKM may have advantages.

In Spain, Novartis started a personalized managed access program, which allowed free access to erenumab before official reimbursement. The Spanish Neurological Society started a prospective registry to evaluate real-world effectiveness and tolerability, and all Spanish headache experts were invited to participate. We present their first results. METHODS Patients fulfilled the ICHD-3 criteria for migraine and had ≥ 4 MMDs. Sociodemographic and clinical data were registered as well as MMDs, monthly headache days, MHDs, prior and concomitant preventive treatment, medication overuse headache (MOH), migraine evolution, adverse events, and patient-reported outcomes (PROs): headache impact test (HIT-6), migraine disability assessment questionnaire (MIDAS), and patient global improvement change (PGIC). A > 50% reduction of MMDs after 12 weeks was considered as a response. RESULTS We included 210 patients (female 86.7%, mean age 46.4 years old) from 22 Spanish hospitals from February 2019 to June 2020. Most patients (89.5%) suffered from chronic migraine with a mean evolution of 8.6 years. MOH was present in 70% of patients, and 17.1% had migraine with aura. Patients had failed a mean of 7.8 preventive treatments at baseline (botulinum toxin type A-BoNT/A-had been used by 95.2% of patients). Most patients (67.6%) started with erenumab 70 mg. Sixty-one percent of patients were also simultaneously taking oral preventive drugs and 27.6% were getting simultaneous BoNT/A. Responder rate was 37.1% and the mean reduction of MMDs and MHDs was -6.28 and -8.6, respectively. Changes in PROs were: MIDAS: -35 points, HIT-6: -11.6 points, PIGC: 4.7 points. Predictors of good response were prior HIT-6 score < 80 points (p = 0.01), ≤ 5 prior preventive treatment failures (p = 0.026), absence of MOH (p = 0.039), and simultaneous BoNT/A treatment (p < 0.001). Twenty percent of patients had an adverse event, but only two of them were severe (0.9%), which led to treatment discontinuation. Mild constipation was the most frequent adverse event (8.1%). CONCLUSIONS In real-life, in a personalized managed access program, erenumab shows a good effectiveness profile and an excellent tolerability in migraine prevention in our cohort of refractory patients.","Belvís, Robert; Irimia, Pablo; Pozo-Rosich, Patricia; González-Oria, Carmen; Cano, Antonio; Viguera, Javier; Sánchez, Belén; Molina, Francisco; Beltrán, Isabel; Oterino, Agustín; Cuadrado, Elisa; Gómez-Camello, Angel; Alberte-Woodward, Miguel; Jurado, Carmen; Oms, Teresa; Ezpeleta, David; de Terán, Javier Díaz; Morollón, Noemí; Latorre, Germán; Torres-Ferrús, Marta; Alpuente, Alicia; Lamas, Raquel; Toledano, Carlos; Leira, Rogelio; Santos, Sonia; Del Río, Margarita Sánchez",The journal of headache and pain,258,1

Thus, the main objective of this study was to examine the usefulness of Nutritional status-2002 (NRS-2002) among COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). MATERIAL AND METHODS In this cross-sectional study, 73 patients with definitive corona diagnosis admitted to the ICUs of Al-Zahra hospital, Isfahan, Iran in October 2020 to January 2021 were recruited. Dietary intake, NRS-2002, demographic, anthropometric and biochemical indices of patients were recorded. RESULTS The majority of patients were at risk for moderate (69.9%) to severe (12.3%) malnutrition. Daily calorie intake (P=0.001) and albumin (P = 0.001) levels in deceased patients were significantly lower than the recovered group. A direct correlation between NRS-2002 and age (P<0.001) and an inverse correlation with daily calorie intake (P=0.002), albumin (P=0.05) and PaO2 (P=0.034) was found. Moreover, there is a strong correlation between NRS-2002 score and chance of death among COVID-19 patients (OR=34.5, 95%CI:(5.2 - 228.93), P-value<0.001). Likewise, the levels of bilirubin direct (OR=8, 95%CI:(1.30 - 49.38), P-value=0.025) and creatine-phosphokinase (OR=0.9, 95%CI:(0.99 - 1.00), P-value=0.035) have a significant direct association with chance of death. CONCLUSION Results showed patients with COVID-19 admitted to the ICU did not have appropriate nutritional status and mortality was higher among patients with lower amounts of the serum albumin and daily calorie intakes. Furthermore, there is a strong association between the NRS-2002 index and the chance of mortality in these patients.","Alikiaii, Babak; Heidari, Zahra; Fazeli, Afshar; Rahimi Varposhti, Mojtaba; Moradi Farsani, Darioush; Fattahpour, Shirin; Rafiee, Sahar; Bagherniya, Mohammad",International journal of clinical practice,258,7

In the present study, 11 complete genomes of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) field isolates from China were determined and analyzed. Frequently occurring mutations were observed, which suggested that full understanding of the genomic and epidemiological characteristics is critical in the fight against PEDV epidemics. Comparative analysis of 49 available genomes clustered the PEDV strains into pandemic (PX) and classical (CX) groups and identified four hypervariable regions (V1 to V4). Further study indicated key roles for the spike (S) gene and the V2 region in distinguishing between the PX and CX groups and for studying genetic evolution. Genotyping and phylogeny-based geographical dissection based on 219 S genes revealed the complexity and severity of PEDV epidemics in Asia. Many subgroups have formed, with a wide array of mutations in different countries, leading to the outbreak of PEDV in Asia. Spatiotemporal reconstruction based on the analysis suggested that the pandemic group strains originated from South Korea and then extended into Japan, Thailand, and China. However, the novel pandemic strains in South Korea that appeared after 2013 may have originated from a Chinese variant. Thus, the serious PED epidemics in China and South Korea in recent years were caused by the complex subgroups of PEDV. The data in this study have important implications for understanding the ongoing PEDV outbreaks in Asia and will guide future efforts to effectively prevent and control PEDV.","Sun, Min; Ma, Jiale; Wang, Yanan; Wang, Ming; Song, Wenchao; Zhang, Wei; Lu, Chengping; Yao, Huochun",Journal of clinical microbiology,258,25

METHODS Saturation was recorded every 10 s for up to 2 weeks in 176 oxygen dependent preterm infants in 35 UK and Irish neonatal units between August 2006 and April 2009 using Masimo SET Radical pulse oximeters. Frequency distributions of % time at each saturation were plotted. An artefact affecting the saturation distribution was found to be attributable to the oximeter's internal calibration algorithm. Revised software was installed and saturation distributions obtained were compared with four other current oximeters in paired studies. RESULTS There was a reduction in saturation values of 87-90%. Values above 87% were elevated by up to 2%, giving a relative excess of higher values. The software revision eliminated this, improving the distribution of saturation values. In paired comparisons with four current commercially available oximeters, Masimo oximeters with the revised software returned similar saturation distributions. CONCLUSIONS A characteristic of the software algorithm reduces the frequency of saturations of 87-90% and increases the frequency of higher values returned by the Masimo SET Radical pulse oximeter. This effect, which remains within the recommended standards for accuracy, is removed by installing revised software (board firmware V4.8 or higher). Because this observation is likely to influence oxygen targeting, it should be considered in the analysis of the oxygen trial results to maximise their generalisability.","Johnston, Ewen D; Boyle, Breidge; Juszczak, Ed; King, Andy; Brocklehurst, Peter; Stenson, Ben J",Archives of disease in childhood.

Depending on the applied equivalents of DBCO-HA, stable nanoparticles with either cationic or anionic surface charge can be formed. The unmodified and two types of covalent HA-modified siRNA nanoparticles differ in their biological characteristics. Both types of HA coated siRNA complexes show an enhanced cellular uptake over uncoated complexes and facilitate efficient gene silencing, but differ in intracellular uptake pathways and distribution. Upon intravenous administration in mice, beyond our expectation and in contrast to the in vitro findings, only the cationic HA nanoparticles but neither the non-coated cationic nor the anionic HA complexes were able to target subcutaneous Huh 7 tumors and exert potent (78%) gene silencing. The favorable and very fast accumulation of cationic HA nanoparticles was confirmed in another subcutaneous tumor model. As evidenced by 3D nanoparticle distribution within Huh 7 tumors evaluated at early time points of 5 min and 45 min, only the cationic HA-based nanoparticles rapidly attach to the tumor endothelium and subsequently penetrate into tumor, in contrast to the analogous anionic HA coated or the cationic non-coated formulation.","Luo, Jie; Schmaus, Johannes; Cui, Mochen; Hörterer, Elisa; Wilk, Ulrich; Höhn, Miriam; Däther, Maike; Berger, Simone; Benli-Hoppe, Teoman; Peng, Lun; Wagner, Ernst",Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society,258,31

Patients commonly present with gastrointestinal bleeding or abdominal pain with 10-30% of patients presenting with symptoms of gastrointestinal obstruction. PRESENTATION OF A CASE We present a case of a 65-year-old gentleman who presented with symptomatic iron deficiency anaemia. Gastroscopy revealed a large submucosal lesion originating from the gastric fundus, consistent with a GIST. The patient developed acute epigastric pain, vomiting with raised inflammatory markers. A CT of the abdomen revealed the GIST to be causing gastric outlet obstruction as result of a prolapse of the tumour through the pylorus into the duodenum. This also resulted in compression of the distal common bile duct and was associated with the radiological appearance of acute pancreatitis. This responded to conservative management. The GIST was resected subsequently using a laparoscopic technique. DISCUSSION Only one similar case has previously been reported in the literature. Several surgical approached have been described in the management of gastric GISTs including open, laparoscopic, hand assisted, ultrasound assisted and a combined endoscopic and laparoscopic approach. A laparosopic 'eversion' techinque was preferred in our case due to the close proximity of the tumour to the gastro-oesophageal junction. CONCLUSION Pancreatitis secondary to a prolapsed gastric GIST is a rare entity. Laparoscopic wedge resection of these tumours can be safely performed with a satisfactory oncological outcome.","Jones, Owain; Monk, David; Balling, Trevor; Wright, Ann",International journal of surgery case reports,258,7

Thus, planning with regard to health concerns can decisively help in infection control and continuity of businesses during the pandemic. The aim of this study was to evaluate the COVID-19 control management measures in the Sepid-farab Kavir Steel Complex (SKS complex) located in Isfahan province (Iran) using strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) matrix. After a literature review and field surveys, all weak, strong, threatening, and opportunity points were collected and were listed using the internal factor evaluation (IFE) and external factor evaluation (EFE) matrices and then were prioritized and weighted. Next, given the sum of scores of IFE and EFE, the SWOT matrix was constructed, the disease prevention and control strategies in the complex was determined, and finally, experts proposed corrective measures to improve the current situation. The results of the IFE matrix (IFE) analysis showed that in terms of corona control, there are more weaknesses than strengths within the company (the score of this matrix was 201.12). Also the score of 165 on the EFE matrix indicated that external threats were predominant, compared to external opportunities of company. SWOT analysis showed that despite some external problems and challenges, the existence of a favorable internal decision-making system had an important role in developing appropriate health strategies and implementing effective prevention measures in SKS complex against the COVID-19.","Hesami Arani, Mohsen; Moslemzadeh, Mehrdad; Fallahzadeh, Omid; Khorvash, Hamidreza; Dakhilpour, Mahmoud; Mohammadzadeh, Mahdiyeh",Toxicology and industrial health,258,8

However, only limited PRMCECL nanoluminophores and their applications in ratiometric biosensors eliminating proportional errors have been reported. Herein, a novel PRMCECL nanoluminophore was synthesized by encapsulating CdS quantum dots (CdSQDs) into MOF-5 (CdSQDs@MOF-5). Using K2S2O8 as a coreactant, two electrochemiluminescence (ECL) peaks, ECL-1 centered at 685 nm and ECL-2 centered at 475 nm, were observed at -1.4 V and -1.8 V, respectively. Related ECL mechanisms have been proposed. Based on the potential-resolved ECL signals, a label-free differential ECL immunosensor for the determination of cardiac troponin I (cTnI) was established by assembly of poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride), CdSQDs@MOF-5 and cTnI antibody functionalized silver nanoparticles on the surface of fluorine doped tin oxide electrode subsequently. In the presence of cTnI, cTnI was captured by the sensing interface, leading to an increase in ECL-1 and ECL-2 intensity. cTnI could be determined in the range of 0.01 - 1000 pg/mL with a detection limit of 5.01 fg/mL by using intensity difference between ECL-1 and ECL-2. This work provides a new family member of PRMCECL nanoluminophores. The proposed label-free differential ECL immunosensor provides a new strategy based on potential-resolved ECL signals, which could effectively eliminate the additive error and show better sensitivity, selectivity and accuracy for the detection of cTnI than single-signal strategy and ratiometric strategy.","Du, Dexin; Shu, Jiangnan; Guo, Mingquan; Haghighatbin, Mohammad Amin; Yang, Di; Bian, Zhiping; Cui, Hua",Analytical chemistry,258,31

STUDY DESIGN This is a consecutive 5 year prospective observational study in which 119 patients presented with at least a Stage 2 apical prolapse, with an anterior or a posterior vaginal wall prolapse, who underwent a double sacrocolpopexy. Two large pore size (≥ 1mm) heavyweight (115 g/m(2)) multifilaments of polyester prostheses (Parietex Prosup PAC/GK 06, Sofradim-Covidien) were exclusively used for this technique. The prostheses were fixed on the levator ani muscles, the vagina and the sacrum with permanent extracorporeal laparoscopic sutures. Pre- and post-operative data referring to international pelvic organ prolapse quantitation classification (POP-Q), scores of quality of life and sexuality (French equivalent of the Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory (PFDI), Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire (PFIQ) and Pelvic organ prolapse-urinary Incontinence-Sexual Questionnaire (PISQ-12)) were compared. RESULTS With a mean follow-up of 34 months, 116 patients were accessible for evaluation. For these patients, the anatomical success rates (Stage 0 or 1) on the apical, anterior or posterior compartments were respectively, 97%, 89% and 98%. On the functional level, all the scores of quality of life and sexuality were improved. CONCLUSIONS This study confirms the effectiveness of laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy for the repair of the apical compartment prolapse. It also shows its effectiveness for the anterior compartment repair when the cystocele is moderate and limited to a median defect.

We sought to determine the presence and direction of any association between GERD and sleep events in patients with OSA. MATERIALS AND METHODS We conducted a case-crossover study among 18 patients with known OSA and GERD. All study patients underwent overnight simultaneous polysomnography and esophageal pH monitoring. A series of case-crossover analyses was conducted by defining each of the sleep (i.e. arousal, awakening, and apnea) and gastroesophageal reflux (GER) events as the outcome in turn. Respective control time points were randomly selected in all eligible control periods. When a sleep event was the outcome, the GER event was the exposure of interest. When GER was the outcome, each sleep event was assessed as the exposure individually. Conditional logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS Both awakenings and arousals were significantly associated with the subsequent onset of a GER event. The OR for a GER event following an awakening was 5 (95% CI 3.6-6.9) and for a GER event following an arousal was 2.5 (95% CI 1.8-3.4). Apnea did not lead to GER (OR 1.0, 95% CI 0.8-1.4). GER was not more commonly observed before any of the sleep events compared with control periods without sleep events. CONCLUSION In patients with coexisting GERD and OSA, both awakening and arousal preceded GER events, but GER does not appear to precipitate sleep-related events.","Yang, Yu-Xiao; Spencer, Geoffrey; Schutte-Rodin, Sharon; Brensinger, Colleen; Metz, David C",European journal of gastroenterology & hepatology,258,1

Within Europe, the United Kingdom is the most severely affected country, with a death toll in excess of 100.000 as of February 2021. We aimed to compare the national impact of Covid19 on the risk of death in UK cancer patients versus those in continental Europe (EU). Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of the OnCovid study database, a European registry of cancer patients consecutively diagnosed with Covid-19 in 27 centres from February 27 to September 10, 2020. We analysed case fatality rates and risk of death at 30 days and 6 months stratified by region of origin (UK versus EU). We compared patient characteristics at baseline, oncological and Covid-19 specific therapy across cohorts and tested these in multivariable Cox regression models to identify predictors of adverse outcome in UK versus EU patients. Results: Compared to EU patients (n = 924), UK patients (n = 468) were characterised by higher case fatality rates (40.38% versus 26.5%, p &lt; 0.0001), higher risk of death at 30 days (hazard ratio, HR 1.64 [95%CI 1.36-1.99]) and 6 months after Covid-19 diagnosis (47.64% versus 33.33%, p &lt; 0.0001, HR 1.59 [95%CI 1.33-1.88]).

Despite equal proportions of complicated Covid-19, rates of intensive care admission and use of mechanical ventilation, UK cancer patients were less likely to receive anti-Covid-19 therapies including corticosteroids, anti-virals and interleukin-6 antagonists (p &lt; 0.0001). Multivariable analyses adjusted for imbalanced prognostic factors confirmed the UK cohort to be characterised by worse risk of death at 30 days and 6 months, independent of patient's age, gender, tumour stage and status, number of co-morbidities, Covid-19 severity, receipt of anti-cancer and anti-Covid-19 therapy. Rates of permanent cessation of anti-cancer therapy post Covid-19 were similar in UK versus EU. Conclusions: UK cancer patients have been more severely impacted by the unfolding of the Covid-19 pandemic despite societal risk mitigation factors and rapid deferral of anti-cancer therapy. The increased frailty of UK cancer patients highlights high-risk groups that should be prioritised for anti-SARS-Cov-2 vaccination. Continued evaluation of long-term outcomes is warranted.","Pinato, D. J.; Scotti, L.; Gennari, A.; Colomba, E.; Sita-Lumsden, A.; Loizidou, A.; Zambelli, A.; Bower, M.; Soler, R. S.; Bertuzzi, A.

The mechanisms underlying these differences in clinical outcomes have yet to be defined. We had access to a cohort of YF infected subjects that showed these range of outcomes. An unbiased integrated OMICs approach was used to identify pathways and effector molecules that drive the severe disease and death as compared to resolution of infection. We used the MELD and SIC score as objective markers of disease severity. We show that a specific signature of upregulated innate pro-inflammatory cytokines significantly demarcates subjects with severe disease leading to death from subjects who clear virus. Pathogen sequencing showed heightened levels of proteolytic bacteria at the i.e Actinobacteria and these were correlated to lower levels of tryptophan and tyrosine amino acids measured by untargeted metabolomics. These two features were significantly associated to MELD scores synonymous of milder disease. Propionate a bacterial metabolite that triggers Treg differentiation that can as well limit the hyperimmune activation associated to severe outcome was also associated to improved outcome. Our results suggest a model whereby proteolytic bacteria limit the availability of the aromatic amino acid pool available for cytokine production thereby preventing the induction of the cytokine storm that is associated to severe disease and death.,"Pelletier, A.-N.; Tomazella, M.; De Carvalho, K.

In addition to these pathways, transactivation of non-receptor tyrosine kinase (Src), PDGF receptors (PDGFRs), and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt has been implicated in the expression of inflammatory genes. Here, we further investigated whether these different mechanisms participating in IL-1beta-induced ICAM-1 expression in A549 cells. We initially observed that IL-1beta-induced ICAM-1 promoter activity was attenuated by the inhibitors of Src (PP1), PDGFR (AG1296), PI3-K (LY294002 and wortmannin), and Akt (SH-5), revealed by reporter gene assay, Western blotting, and RT-PCR analyses. The involvement of Src and PI3-K/Akt in IL-1beta-induced ICAM-1 expression was significantly attenuated by transfection of A549 cells with dominant negative plasmids of Src, p85 and Akt, respectively. Src, PDGFR, and PI3K/Akt mediated the effects of IL-1beta because pretreatment with PP1, AG1296, and wortmannin also abrogated IL-1beta-stimulated Src, PDGFR, and Akt phosphorylation, respectively. Moreover, pretreatment with p300 inhibitor (curcumin) also blocked ICAM-1 expression. We further confirmed that p300 was associated with ICAM-1 promoter which was dynamically linked to histone H4 acetylation stimulated by IL-1beta, determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Association of p300 and histone-H4 to ICAM-1 promoter was inhibited by LY294002. Up-regulation of ICAM-1 enhanced the adhesion of neutrophils onto A549 cell monolayer exposed to IL-1beta, which was inhibited by PP1, AG1296, LY294002, wortmannin, and helenalin. These results suggested that Akt phosphorylation mediated through transactivation of Src/PDGFR promotes the transcriptional p300 activity and eventually leads to ICAM-1 expression induced by IL-1beta.","Lin, Chih-Chung; Lee, Chiang-Wen; Chu, Tzu-Hua; Cheng, Ching-Yi; Luo, Shue-Fen; Hsiao, Li-Der; Yang, Chuen-Mao",Journal of cellular physiology,258,23

METHODS: Mamás del Río is a community-based, MNH programme with comprehensive supervision covering monthly meetings with community health workers (CHW), community leaders and health facilities. With the onset of the lockdown, supervisors made telephone calls to discuss measures against COVID-19, governmental support, CHW activities in communities and provision of MNH care and COVID-19 preparedness at facilities. As part of the programme's ongoing mixed methods evaluation, we analysed written summaries of supervisor calls collected during the first 2 months of Peru's lockdown. RESULTS: Between March and May 2020, supervisors held two rounds of calls with CHWs and leaders of 68 communities and staff from 17 facilities. Most communities banned entry of foreigners, but about half tolerated residents travelling to regional towns for trade and social support. While social events were forbidden, strict home isolation was only practised in a third of communities as conflicting with daily routine. By the end of April, first clusters of suspected cases were reported in communities. COVID-19 test kits, training and medical face masks were not available in most rural facilities. Six out of seven facilities suspended routine antenatal and postnatal consultations while two-thirds of CHWs resumed home visits to pregnant women and newborns. CONCLUSIONS: Home isolation was hardly feasible in the rural Amazon context and community isolation was undermined by lack of external supplies and social support. With sustained community transmission, promotion of basic hygiene and mask use becomes essential. To avoid devastating effects on MNH, routine services at facilities need to be urgently re-established alongside COVID-19 preparedness plans. Community-based MNH programmes could offset detrimental indirect effects of the pandemic and provide an opportunity for local COVID-19 prevention and containment.","Reinders, Stefan; Alva, Angela; Huicho, Luis; Blas, Magaly M",BMJ Open,258,22

The trained model further generates valid but previously unseen strategies for Go. Because GPT-2 preserves punctuation and spacing, the raw output of the text generator provides inputs to game visualization and creative patterns, such as the Sabaki project's (2020) game engine using auto-replays. Results demonstrate that language modeling can capture both the sequencing format of championship Go games and their strategic formations. Compared to random game boards, the GPT-2 fine-tuning shows efficient opening move sequences favoring corner play over less advantageous center and side play.

Methods: An online, cross-sectional questionnaire among HCWs between December 21, 2020 to January 7, 2021. The outcome variables were HCWs' knowledge and awareness of the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 lineage that was recently reported as the UK variant of concern, and its associated travel worry and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) score. Results: A total of 1,058 HCWs completed the survey; 66.5% were female, 59.0% were nurses. 9.0% indicated they had been previously diagnosed with COVID-19. Regarding the B.1.1.7 lineage, almost all (97.3%) were aware of its emergence, 73.8% were aware that it is more infectious, 78.0% thought it causes more severe disease, and only 50.0% knew that current COVID-19 vaccines are effective in preventing it.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the association between obesity and poor outcomes in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis of studies from the PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases from 1 November 2019 to 24 May 2020 was performed. Study quality was assessed, and data extraction was conducted. The meta-analysis was carried out using fixed-effects and random-effects models to calculate odds ratios (ORs) of several poor outcomes in obese and non-obese COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: Twenty-two studies (n = 12,591 patients) were included. Pooled analysis demonstrated that body mass index (BMI) was higher in severe/critical COVID-19 patients than in mild COVID-19 patients (MD 2.48 kg/m2, 95% CI [2.00 to 2.96 kg/m2]). Additionally, obesity in COVID-19 patients was associated with poor outcomes (OR = 1.683, 95% CI [1.408-2.011]), which comprised severe COVID-19, ICU care, invasive mechanical ventilation use, and disease progression (OR = 4.17, 95% CI [2.32-7.48]; OR = 1.57, 95% CI [1.18-2.09]; OR = 2.13, 95% CI [1.10-4.14]; OR = 1.41, 95% CI [1.26-1.58], respectively). Obesity as a risk factor was greater in younger patients (OR 3.30 vs. 1.72). However, obesity did not increase the risk of hospital mortality (OR = 0.89, 95% CI [0.32-2.51]). CONCLUSIONS: As a result of a potentially critical role of obesity in determining the severity of COVID-19, it is important to collect anthropometric information for COVID-19 patients, especially the younger group. However, obesity may not be associated with hospital mortality, and efforts to understand the impact of obesity on the mortality of COVID-19 patients should be a research priority in the future.","Chu, Yanan; Yang, Jinxiu; Shi, Jiaran; Zhang, Pingping; Wang, Xingxiang",Eur J Med Res,258,22

Studies on online individual therapy indicate that therapists often have favorable attitudes toward this modality. To date, there is scant work on couples therapists' attitudes, despite the fact that the provision of online couples' therapy poses unique challenges (e.g., dealing with escalating conflict remotely). To provide a snapshot, in real time, as to how therapists experience the transition to online therapy, we surveyed 166 Israeli couples' therapists during April 2020, when lockdown orders prevented therapists from seeing couples face-to-face. A few weeks later, when the stay-at-home policy was lifted, a subsample (N = 60) of these therapists completed a follow-up assessment. The results suggest that couples therapists had limited experience using the online modality prior to COVID. The therapists reported experiencing online couples' therapy as somewhat successful and that their experience of providing therapy during the COVID-19 crisis had an overall positive impact on their attitudes toward online work. Establishing a strong therapeutic bond with both partners, dealing with escalating conflict, and treatment dropout were identified as the issues of most concern when conducting online couples therapy. The perceived difficulties with online therapy prospectively predicted lower usage of online couples' therapy, as well as less intention to continue online treatment once the crisis is over.","Machluf, Reut; Abba Daleski, Michal; Shahar, Ben; Kula, Ofra; Bar-Kalifa, Eran",Fam. process,258,32

Clinical reports show that both mild and severe forms of disease result in changes in circulating leukocyte subsets and cytokine secretion, particularly IL-6, IL-1ß, IL-10, TNF, GM-CSF, IP-10 (IFN-induced protein 10), IL-17, MCP-3, and IL-1ra. Not surprising, therapies that target the immune response and curtail the cytokine storm in coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) patients have become a focus of recent clinical trials. Here we review reports on leukocyte and cytokine data associated with COVID-19 disease in 3939 patients in China and describe emerging data on immunopathology. With an emphasis on immune modulation, we also look at ongoing clinical studies aimed at blocking proinflammatory cytokines; transfer of immunosuppressive mesenchymal stem cells; use of convalescent plasma transfusion; as well as immunoregulatory therapy and traditional Chinese medicine regimes. In examining leukocyte and cytokine activity in COVID-19, we focus in particular on how these levels are altered as the disease progresses (neutrophil NETosis, macrophage, T cell response, etc.) and proposed consequences to organ pathology (coagulopathy, etc.). Viral and host interactions are described to gain further insight into leukocyte biology and how dysregulated cytokine responses lead to disease and/or organ damage. By better understanding the mechanisms that drive the intensity of a cytokine storm, we can tailor treatment strategies at specific disease stages and improve our response to this worldwide public health threat.","Wang, Jin; Jiang, Mengmeng; Chen, Xin; Montaner, Luis J",J Leukoc Biol,258,24

Emergency services and intensive care units (ICUs) were faced with a novel disease with unknown clinical characteristics and presentations. Acute respiratory distress (ARD) was often the chief complaint for an EMS call. This retrospective study evaluated prehospital ARD management and identified factors associated with the need of prehospital mechanical ventilation (PMV) for suspected COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We included 256 consecutive patients with suspected COVID-19-related ARD that received prehospital care from a Paris Fire Brigade BLS or ALS team, from March 08 to April 18, 2020. We performed multivariate regression to identify factors predisposing to PMV. RESULTS: Of 256 patients (mean age 60 ± 18 years; 82 (32%) males), 77 (30%) had previous hypertension, 31 (12%) were obese, and 49 (19%) had diabetes mellitus. Nineteen patients (7%) required PMV. Logistic regression observed that a low initial pulse oximetry was associated with prehospital PMV (ORa = 0.86, 95%CI: 0.73-0.92; p = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that pulse oximetry might be a valuable marker for rapidly determining suspected COVID-19-patients requiring prehospital mechanical ventilation. Nevertheless, the impact of prehospital mechanical ventilation on COVID-19 patients outcome require further investigations.","Jouffroy, Romain; Lemoine, Sabine; Derkenne, Clément; Kedzierewicz, Romain; Scannavino, Marine; Bertho, Kilian; Frattini, Benoit; Lemoine, Frédéric; Jost, Daniel; Prunet, Bertrand",Am. j. emerg. med,258,27

Being homebound is associated with decreased access to medical services, poor health outcomes, and increased mortality. Yet, it is unknown what factors, in particular socioeconomic factors, are associated with new onset of homebound status. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between income and risk of becoming homebound. DESIGN: Observational cohort study using 2011 to 2018 data from the National Health and Aging Trends Study, a nationally representative sample of Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years and older. SETTING: Population-based study in the United States. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 7,042 initially nonhomebound community-dwelling older adults. EXPOSURE: Total annual household income at baseline (in 2011) measured via self-report. OUTCOME: Annual measure of homebound status, defined as leaving home an average of 1 d/wk or less. RESULTS: Over 7 years, 15.81% of older adults in the lowest income quartile (&#8804;$15,003) became homebound, compared with only 4.64% of those in the highest income quartile (>$60,000). In a competing risks analysis accounting for risks of death and nursing home admission, and adjusted for clinical and demographic characteristics, those in the lowest income quartile had a substantially higher subhazard of becoming homebound than those in the highest income quartile (1.65; 95% confidence interval = 1.20-2.29). Moreover, we see evidence of a gradient in risk of homebound status by income quartile. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Our work demonstrates that financial resources shape the risk of becoming homebound, which is associated with negative health consequences. In the context of existing income disparities, more support is needed to assist older adults with limited financial resources who wish to remain in the community.","Ornstein, Katherine A; Garrido, Melissa M; Bollens-Lund, Evan; Reckrey, Jennifer M; Husain, Mohammed; Ferreira, Katelyn B; Liu, Shelley H; Ankuda, Claire K; Kelley, Amy S; Siu, Albert L",J. am. geriatr. soc,258,32

I show that these variations are strongly correlated with the levels of the ACE2 protein in the lungs but surprisingly, despite ACE2 is the viral receptor, higher levels lead to lower fatality. This behaviour is consistent with a previous mathematical model that predicts that the speed of viral progression in the organism has a maximum and then declines with the receptor level. SARS-Cov-2 degrades ACE2 and thus worsens lung injury, causes vasoconstriction, thrombotic problems, and exacerbated inflammatory response. I developed a mathematical model based on the influence of ACE2 on viral propagation and on the negative effects of its degradation. The model fits SARS-CoV-2 fatality rate across age and gender with high accuracy ($r^2>0.9$). Rescaling the model parameters with the binding rates of the spike proteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 allows predicting the fatality rate of SARS-CoV across age and gender, in particular its higher severity for young patients, thus linking the molecular and epidemiological levels. These results support the suggestion that drugs that enhance the expression of ACE2, such as ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, constitute a promising therapy against the most adverse effects of CoViD-19. Furthermore, ACE2 is a candidate prognostic factor for detecting population that needs stronger protection.","Bastolla, Ugo",,258,1

As a result, it has become important to understand the disease trends in order to mitigate its effects. The aim of this study is firstly to develop a prediction model for daily confirmed COVID-19 cases based on several covariates, and secondly, to select the best prediction model based on a subset of these covariates. METHODOLOGY: This study was conducted using daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 collected from the official Ministry of Health, Malaysia (MOH) and John Hopkins University websites. An Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model was fitted to the training data of observed cases from 22 January to 31 March 2020, and subsequently validated using data on cases from 1 April to 17 April 2020. The ARIMA model satisfactorily forecasted the daily confirmed COVID-19 cases from 18 April 2020 to 1 May 2020 (the testing phase). RESULTS: The ARIMA (0,1,0) model produced the best fit to the observed data with a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) value of 16.01 and a Bayes Information Criteria (BIC) value of 4.170. The forecasted values showed a downward trend of COVID-19 cases until 1 May 2020. Observed cases during the forecast period were accurately predicted and were placed within the prediction intervals generated by the fitted model. CONCLUSIONS: This study finds that ARIMA models with optimally selected covariates are useful tools for monitoring and predicting trends of COVID-19 cases in Malaysia.","Singh, Sarbhan; Murali Sundram, Bala; Rajendran, Kamesh; Boon Law, Kian; Aris, Tahir; Ibrahim, Hishamshah; Chandra Dass, Sarat; Singh Gill, Balvinder",J Infect Dev Ctries,258,1

Two different data sets were used, one accessible for the public and the other available on request. After combining the data sets, the features were obtained from the cough sounds using the mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) method, and then they were classified with seven different machine learning classifiers. To determine the optimum values of hyperparameters for MFCCs and classifiers, the leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO-CV) strategy was implemented. Based on the results, the k-nearest neighbors classifier based on the Euclidean distance (k-NN Euclidean) with the accuracy rate, sensitivity of COVID-19, sensitivity of non-COVID-19, F-measure, and area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.9833, 1.0000, 0.9720, 0.9799, and 0.9860, respectively, is more successful than other classifiers. Finally, the best and most effective features were determined for each classifier using the sequential forward selection (SFS) method. According to the results, the proposed system is excellent compared with similar studies in the literature and can be easily used in smartphones and facilitate the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients. In addition, since the used data set includes reflex and unconscious coughs, the results showed that conscious or unconscious coughing has no effect on the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients based on the cough sound.","Maleki, Masoud",,258,23

Today, according to modern vaccinology, virus-like particle (VLP) technology is involved in many vaccines, including those undergoing studies related to COVID-19. The potential use of VLPs as vaccine adjuvants opens an opportunity for the use of protozoan antigens for the development of vaccines against diseases caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, Leishmania spp., and Trypanosoma brucei. In this context, it is important to consider the evasion mechanisms of these protozoa in the host and the antigens involved in the mechanisms of the parasite-host interaction. Thus, the immunostimulatory properties of VLPs can be part of an important strategy for the development and evaluation of new vaccines.

Methods: REACH expanded its telemedicine capabilities by transitioning its in-person clinic and methods of connecting with referrals to telemedicine. The program provided patients with phones to increase access to needed technology. Results: Throughout 2020, patient visits continuously shifted from being entirely in-person, to entirely telemedicine, to a hybrid model. Clinic show rates averaged 71% with this hybrid model, compared with 57% pre-COVID-19. Phones were distributed to 88 patients, 77% of which engaged in at least one telemedicine visit.

Dengue and COVID-19, to some extent, have similar clinical and laboratory features, which can lead to misdiagnosis, delayed treatment and patient's isolation. The use of rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) is easy and convenient for fast diagnosis, however there may be issues with cross-reactivity with antibodies for other pathogens. METHODS: We assessed the possibility of cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV-2 and dengue antibodies by: (1) testing five brands of COVID-19 IgG / IgM RDTs on 60 RT-PCR-confirmed dengue samples; (2) testing 95 RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 samples on dengue RDT; and (3) testing samples positive for COVID-19 IgG and/or IgM on dengue RDT. RESULTS: We observed a high specificity across all five brands of COVID-19 RDTs, ranging from 98.3 to 100%. Out of the confirmed COVID-19 samples, one patient tested positive for dengue IgM only, another tested positive for dengue IgG only. One patient tested positive for dengue IgG, IgM, and NS1, suggesting a co-infection. In COVID-19 IgG and/or IgM samples, 6.3% of COVID-19 IgG-positive samples also tested positive for dengue IgG, while 21.1% of COVID-19 IgM-positive samples also tested positive for dengue IgG. CONCLUSION: Despite the high specificity of the COVID-19 RDT, we observed cross-reactions and false-positive results between dengue and COVID-19. Dengue and COVID-19 co-infection was also found. Health practitioners in dengue endemic areas should be careful when using antibody RDT for the diagnosis of dengue during the COVID-19 pandemic to avoid misdiagnosis.","Santoso, Marsha S; Masyeni, Sri; Haryanto, Sotianingsih; Yohan, Benediktus; Hibberd, Martin L; Sasmono, R Tedjo",Virol J,258,2

Rate terms dependent upon the chirality of the donor and acceptor species are extracted using the Fermi golden rule. Interestingly, the mediated rate is discriminatory. For freely tumbling particles it exhibits an inverse-square dependence on each interparticle separation distance, indicating a purely radiative exchange mechanism. Furthermore, the isotropic rate is found to be a maximum for a collinear geometry and vanishes when the angle between the donor, mediator, and acceptor is 90°.

The psychological sequelae of the pandemic will probably persist for months and years to come. Studies indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with distress, anxiety, fear of contagion, depression and insomnia in the general population and among healthcare professionals. Social isolation, anxiety, fear of contagion, uncertainty, chronic stress and economic difficulties may lead to the development or exacerbation of depressive, anxiety, substance use and other psychiatric disorders in vulnerable populations including individuals with pre-existing psychiatric disorders and people who reside in high COVID-19 prevalence areas. Stress-related psychiatric conditions including mood and substance use disorders are associated with suicidal behavior. COVID-19 survivors may also be at elevated suicide risk. The COVID-19 crisis may increase suicide rates during and after the pandemic. Mental health consequences of the COVID-19 crisis including suicidal behavior are likely to be present for a long time and peak later than the actual pandemic. To reduce suicides during the COVID-19 crisis, it is imperative to decrease stress, anxiety, fears and loneliness in the general population. There should be traditional and social media campaigns to promote mental health and reduce distress. Active outreach is necessary, especially for people with a history of psychiatric disorders, COVID-19 survivors and older adults.

X-ray imaging is a common and easily accessible tool that has great potential for COVID-19 diagnosis and prognosis. Deep learning techniques can generally provide state-of-the-art performance in many classification tasks when trained properly over large data sets. However, data scarcity can be a crucial obstacle when using them for COVID-19 detection. Alternative approaches such as representation-based classification [collaborative or sparse representation (SR)] might provide satisfactory performance with limited size data sets, but they generally fall short in performance or speed compared to the neural network (NN)-based methods. To address this deficiency, convolution support estimation network (CSEN) has recently been proposed as a bridge between representation-based and NN approaches by providing a noniterative real-time mapping from query sample to ideally SR coefficient support, which is critical information for class decision in representation-based techniques. The main premises of this study can be summarized as follows: 1) A benchmark X-ray data set, namely QaTa-Cov19, containing over 6200 X-ray images is created. The data set covering 462 X-ray images from COVID-19 patients along with three other classes; bacterial pneumonia, viral pneumonia, and normal. 2) The proposed CSEN-based classification scheme equipped with feature extraction from state-of-the-art deep NN solution for X-ray images, CheXNet, achieves over 98% sensitivity and over 95% specificity for COVID-19 recognition directly from raw X-ray images when the average performance of 5-fold cross validation over QaTa-Cov19 data set is calculated. 3) Having such an elegant COVID-19 assistive diagnosis performance, this study further provides evidence that COVID-19 induces a unique pattern in X-rays that can be discriminated with high accuracy.","Yamac, Mehmet; Ahishali, Mete; Degerli, Aysen; Kiranyaz, Serkan; Chowdhury, Muhammad E H; Gabbouj, Moncef",IEEE Trans Neural Netw Learn Syst,258,1

In particular, there is still a lack of treatment strategies for the group of elderly and frail patients, who are frequently not capable of receiving standard therapy regimens. Despite comprising the majority of lung cancer patients, this group is underrepresented in clinical trials. This applies also to elderly and frail patients suffering from unresectable stage III NSCLC, who are unfit for chemotherapy, and, therefore, cannot receive the standard therapy comprising of radiochemotherapy and the recently approved subsequent durvalumab consolidation therapy. These patients often receive radiotherapy only, which raises the concern of undertreatment. The TRADE-hypo trial aims at optimizing treatment of this patient group by combining radiotherapy with concomitant durvalumab administration, thereby employing the immune-promoting effects of radiotherapy, and determining safety, feasibility, and efficacy of this treatment. METHODS/ DESIGN: In this prospective phase II clinical trial, durvalumab therapy will be combined with either conventionally fractionated (CON-group) or hypofractionated (HYPO-group) thoracic radiotherapy. A safety stop-and-go lead-in phase will assess safety of hypofractionated radiotherapy with respect to severe pneumonitis in small patient cohorts before opening full enrollment. Tumor tissue, blood and stool samples will be collected before and during the study period to investigate the immunological mechanisms responsible for checkpoint inhibitor efficacy and immune-promoting effects of radiotherapy. DISCUSSION: Preclinical data suggests that irradiation-induced immunogenicity can be further increased if applied in a hypofractionated setting, potentially boosting the expected synergistic effect with immune checkpoint inhibition in restoring the immune anti-tumor response. If proven safe and efficient, a hypofractionated radiation schedule can provide a considerably more practicable option for the patient. Taking into consideration the intend to develop a combination treatment strategy that can be made available to patients soon after proving to be efficient and the potentially elevated toxicity of a hypofractionated radiotherapy approach, this trial was designed as a two-trials-in-one design. An accompanying translational research program is planned striving to gain insights into the tumor-host biology and to identify suitable biomarkers to predict therapy response.

Histopathologic characteristics were not associated with severe AKI; however, pigment casts on the biopsy were associated with significantly lower probability of kidney function recovery (odds ratio, 0.07; 95% confidence interval, 0.01 to 0.77). The use of aminoglycosides/colistin, levels of C-reactive protein and serum albumin, previous use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers, antivirals, nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drugs, and anticoagulants were associated with specific histopathologic findings. CONCLUSIONS: A high prevalence of chronic comorbidities was found on kidney biopsies. Nonrecovery from severe AKI was associated with the presence of pigmented casts. Inflammatory markers and medications were associated with specific histopathologic findings in patients dying from COVID-19.","Rivero, Jesús; Merino-López, Maribel; Olmedo, Rossana; Garrido-Roldan, Rubén; Moguel, Bernardo; Rojas, Gustavo; Chavez-Morales, Alfonso; Alvarez-Maldonado, Pablo; Duarte-Molina, Pablo; Castaño-Guerra, Rodolfo; Ruiz-Lopez, Ivon Karina; Soria-Castro, Elizabeth; Luna, Cesar; Bonilla-Méndez, Alejandro; Baranda, Francisco; Zabal, Carlos; Madero, Magdalena; Valdez-Ortiz, Rafael; Soto-Abraham, Ma Virgilia; Vazquez-Rangel, Armando",Clin J Am Soc Nephrol,258,9

Three different models of thermographic image analyses were used to obtain the mean temperature of 9 ROIs: A) ThermoHuman (automatic definition of ROIs using ThermoHuman® software), B) Manual (manual delimitation of ROIs by proportion criteria), and C) Manual-TH (manual delimitation of ROIs in an attempt to replicate the regions analyzed by ThermoHuman). ThermoHuman resulted in an 86% reduction in time involved compared to manual delimitation. Fourteen of the 120 images (12%) presented some error in one or more of the ROI delimitations. Although the three procedures presented significant differences between them (53% in the comparison between ThermoHuman and Manual, 47% between ThermoHuman and Manual-TH, and 28% between Manual and Manual-TH), all differences had a small effect size (ES 0.2-0.4) or lower (ES < 0.2). Bland-Altman plots showed similar 95% limits of agreement between the three procedures before and after running. Intraclass correlation coefficient analysis of the three procedures presented excellent reliability (ICC>0.8). In conclusion, ThermoHuman® software was observed to be time-saving for image analysis with excellent reliability. Although results suggest that ThermoHuman® and manual methods are both valid in themselves, combining them is not recommended due to the differences observed between them.","Requena-Bueno, Lara; Priego-Quesada, Jose Ignacio; Jimenez-Perez, Irene; Gil-Calvo, Marina; Pérez-Soriano, Pedro",J Therm Biol,258,16

To understand exosome-mediated improvement in cardiac function we examined the proteomic alternations in the MSC exosome-treated mice hearts subjected to left coronary artery (LCA) ligation, with particular emphasis on peri-infarct areas. At 7 days after LCA ligation, left ventricular end systolic thickness, infarct size and survival of mice were studied. Mass spectrometric analysis of infarct and peri-infarct areas was carried out. Expression of inflammatory markers (LOX-1 and NLRP3) and cell death markers (Bax, Bcl-2, Caspases 1 and 3 and GSDMD) were investigated by Western blots and immunofluorescence. Proteomic analysis of the infarct and peri-infarct areas in saline-treated hearts revealed differentially expressed proteins involved in inflammation and apoptotic cell death, while showing depletion of processes governing cell death. Exosome treatment significantly improved the proteomic profile in both infarct and peri-infarct areas, more so in the peri-infarct areas. The infarct size was smaller (9 ± 1%), and cardiac contractile function (fractional shortening) was preserved in the exosome-treated mice (28 ± 2%). Survival of exosome-treated mice was also better. White blood cell accumulation in and around the infarct area, expression of LOX-1 and NLRP3 inflammasome, and markers of cell death (cleaved Caspase-3, Caspase-1, GSDMD, Bcl-2 and Bax) were dramatically reduced by MSC exosome treatment (all p < 0.01). In cultured primary mouse cardiomyocytes, treatment with MSC exosomes essentially reversed inflammation-induced pro-apoptotic and inflammatory signals (p < 0.01). MSC exosomes exert their cardioprotective effects by suppressing inflammation and pro-apoptotic processes, particularly in the peri-infarct areas, resulting in preservation of cardiac function after LCA ligation.","Kore, Rajshekhar A; Wang, Xianwei; Ding, Zufeng; Griffin, Robert J; Tackett, Alan J; Mehta, Jawahar L",Mol. cell. biochem,258,6

Single and clusters of clinical determinants have been identified as presurgery predictors of postsurgery diabetes remission. Our goal was to assess whether the addition of measured preoperative ß-cell function would improve established clinical models of prediction of diabetes remission. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Presurgery clinical characteristics, metabolic markers, and ß-cell function after oral and intravenous (IV) glucose challenges were assessed in 73 individuals with severe obesity and type 2 diabetes and again 1 year after gastric bypass surgery. Single and multivariate analyses were conducted with preoperative variables to determine the best predictive models of remission. RESULTS: Presurgery ß-cell glucose sensitivity, a surrogate of ß-cell function, was negatively correlated with known diabetes duration, HbA1c, insulin use, and the diabetes remission scores DiaRem and advanced (Ad)-DiaRem (all P < 0.001). Measured ß-cell function after oral glucose was 1.6-fold greater than after the IV glucose challenge and more strongly correlated with preoperative clinical and metabolic characteristics. The addition of preoperative ß-cell function to clinical models containing well-defined diabetes remission scores did not improve the model's ability to predict diabetes remission after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of measured ß-cell function does not add predictive value to defined clinical models of diabetes remission 1 year after surgical weight loss.","Ligon, Chanel; Shah, Ankit; Prasad, Malini; Laferrère, Blandine",Diabetes care,258,16

This study aimed to determine how confinement affects children's routines, more specifically their physical activity (PA) and sedentary time. An online survey was launched to assess how Portuguese children under 13 years of age adjusted their daily routines to confinement. Parents reported the time each child was engaged in different activities throughout the day, which was used to calculate overall sedentary time and overall physical activity time. Based on the data of 2159 children, our study showed that during confinement: (i) there was a decrease in children's physical activity time and an increase in screen time and family activities; (ii) boys engaged in more playful screen Time than girls (p < 0.05), and girls played more without PA than boys (p < 0.05); (iii) along the age groups, there was a trend for an increase of the overall sedentary time and an associated decrease of the overall physical activity time. In summary, PA of confined children showed low levels and a clear decreasing trend along childhood.

METHODS: In this longitudinal observational study, survivors of first-ever stroke were evaluated at rehabilitation discharge, 6, 12, and 24 months later. Moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) duration (minutes/day) assessed with an electronic monitor was the primary outcome. Further outcomes included step count, the number and duration of MVPA and sedentary bouts, cardiovascular risk factors (eg, blood pressure, fasting lipid profile, body mass index), gait speed and endurance, mood, fatigue, and cognition. Associations between physical activity and cardiovascular risk factors over time were assessed with random-effects regression modeling. Associations between baseline characteristics and physical activity at 2 years were explored using regression modeling. RESULTS: Seventy-nine participants (68.4% men) with a mean age of 65 years (SD = 14) and a median gait speed of 1.2 m/s (interquartile range = 0.8-1.4) were included at baseline. Associations were found between higher physical activity (MVPA duration, number and duration of MVPA bouts) and lower body mass index. Better gait speed, endurance, and cognition at baseline were associated with higher MVPA and step count at 2 years. CONCLUSIONS: Duration and bouts of MVPA are associated with body mass index. Increasing MVPA and bouts of MVPA may be a valuable treatment goal to reduce cardiovascular risk in survivors of stroke. IMPACT: This 2-year study found that moderate to vigorous physical activity is associated with important cardiovascular risk factors in people who have survived stroke. Understanding these associations could be useful for developing effective treatments to prevent recurrent stroke.","Fini, Natalie A; Bernhardt, Julie; Churilov, Leonid; Clark, Rebecca; Holland, Anne E",Phys. ther,258,31

The artificial iris is based on guest-host liquid crystal cells (GH-LCD) in order to actively modify the transmittance of the lens and effective pupil size. Experimental validation of the GH-LCD spectrum and iris contrast (determined to be 1:2.1) enabled the development of optical models that include the effect of a small pupil on image quality and visual quality on an optical system with aniridia characteristics. Visual simulations at different light conditions (high/low photopic and mesopic) demonstrated the theoretical capacity of the customized artificial iris smart contact lens to expand the depth-of-focus and decrease the optical aberrations (in particular, the spherical aberration). The visual modelling suggests a maximum depth-of-focus value for a 2-mm pupil diameter for both eyes as follows: 3D (1,000 cd/m2), 2D (10 cd/m2) and 0.75D (1 cd/m2). This work demonstrates the beneficial optical effects of an active artificial iris, based on visual simulations in response to different light levels, and enables further experimental investigation on patients to validate the dynamic light attenuation and visual performance of smart contact lenses with GH-LCD.","Vásquez Quintero, Andrés; Pérez-Merino, Pablo; De Smet, Herbert",Sci Rep,258,24

Moreover, since they can evolve fast and cross the species barrier, some of these viruses, such as influenza A and coronaviruses, have sometimes caused epidemics or pandemics and were associated with more serious clinical diseases and even mortality. The recently identified Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a Public Health Emergency of International concern and has been associated with rapidly progressive pneumonia. To ensure protection against emerging respiratory tract infections, the development of new strategies based on modulating the immune responses is essential. The use of probiotic components has substantially increased due to their effects on immune responses, in particular on those that occur in the upper/lower respiratory tract. Superinduction of inflammatory reaction, known as a cytokine storm, has been correlated directly with viral pneumonia and serious complications of respiratory infections.

In general, as a consequence of easing restrictions, we obtain scenarios characterized by high spikes of infections indicating significant acceleration of the spreading disease. Finally, we show how such undesirable scenarios could be avoided by a control strategy of successive partial easing restrictions, namely, we tailor a successive sequence of the additional parameter to prevent spikes in phases of low rate of transmissibility.","de Souza, Silvio L T; Batista, Antonio M; Caldas, Iberê L; Iarosz, Kelly C; Szezech, José D",Chaos Solitons Fractals,258,1

During the pandemic, several complications have been shown to be associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Our goal was to present a series of patients with COVID-19 who underwent chest tube placements due to the development of pleural complications and to make suggestions for the insertion and follow-up management of the chest tube. METHODS: We retrospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in our hospital between 11 March and 15 May 2020. Patients from this patient group who developed pleural complications requiring chest tube insertion were included in the study. RESULTS: A total of 542 patients who were suspected of having COVID-19 were hospitalized. The presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was confirmed with laboratory tests in 342 patients between 11 March and 15 May 2020 in our centre. A chest tube was used in 13 (3.8%) of these patients. A high-efficiency particulate air filter mounted double-bottle technique was used to prevent viral transmission. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with COVID-19, the chest tube can be applied in cases with disease or treatment-related pleural complications. Our case series comprised a small group of patients, which is one of its limitations. Still, our main goal was to present our experience with patients with pleural complications and describe a new drainage technique to prevent viral transmission during chest tube application and follow-up.","Ceylan, Kenan Can; Batihan, Guntug; Yazgan, Serkan; Gürsoy, Soner; Kirakli, Sami Cenk; Ataman, Sena",Eur J Cardiothorac Surg,258,24

METHODS: Online questionnaire surveys were conducted among 3 600 primary school students aged 6-12 years in Jilin Province, China in April, 2020 (during the epidemic) and 3 089 primary school students in September, 2020 (during the regular epidemic prevention and control). The general information and the data related to the Mental Health Scale for Child and Adolescent were collected by the questionnaire surveys. The multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the factors influencing the mental health status of the students during the epidemic. RESULTS: The students during the epidemic had a significantly poorer mental health status in the emotional experience and volitional behavior than those during the regular epidemic prevention and control (P &lt; 0.05). The multivariate logistic regression analysis showed the risk of psychological problems of the students decreased with age (OR=0.895). The girls were at a higher risk of psychological problems than boys (OR=1.453). The students with father's and mother's charater between irritability and gentle were at a lower risk of psychological problems (OR=0.496 and 0.470 respectively). The students from a family with a parental education style of a combination of encouraging and scolding were at a lower risk of psychological problems (OR=0.263). The students from a single-parent family or an extended family were at a higher risk of psychological problems (OR=2.995 and 3.446 respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 epidemic has a certain impact on emotional experience and volitional behavior of primary school students. During the epidemic, particular attention should be paid to the mental health of primary school students, especially girls, younger students, and students from single-parent families, extended families or families with impatient parents and improper parental education.","Zhao, Z.

Our data show significant variability in genetic determinants of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression among individuals and between populations, and indicate a genetic predisposition for lower expression levels of both key viral entry genes in African populations. These data suggest that host genetics related to viral entry mechanisms might influence interindividual variability in disease susceptibility and severity of COVID-19.","Ortiz-Fernández, Lourdes; Sawalha, Amr H",Genes Immun,258,19

We hypothesised that lockdown restrictions were associated with reductions in severe asthma exacerbations requiring emergency asthma admissions and/or leading to death. METHODS: Using data from Public Health Scotland and the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage Databank in Wales, we compared weekly counts of emergency admissions and deaths due to asthma over the first 18 weeks in 2020 with the national averages over 2015-2019. We modelled the impact of instigating lockdown on these outcomes using interrupted time-series analysis. Using fixed-effect meta-analysis, we derived pooled estimates of the overall changes in trends across the two nations. We also investigated trends in asthma-related primary care prescribing and emergency department (ED) attendances in Wales. RESULTS: Lockdown was associated with a 36% pooled reduction in emergency admissions for asthma (incidence rate ratio, IRR: 0.64, 95% CI: 0.49 to 0.83, p value 0.001) across both countries. There was no significant change in asthma deaths (pooled IRR: 0.57, 95% CI: 0.17 to 1.94, p value 0.37). ED asthma attendances in Wales declined during lockdown (IRR: 0.85, 95% CI: 0.73 to 0.99, p value 0.03). A large spike of 121% more inhaled corticosteroids and 133% more oral corticosteroid prescriptions was seen in Wales in the week before lockdown. CONCLUSIONS: National lockdowns were associated with substantial reductions in severe asthma exacerbations leading to hospital admission across both Scotland and Wales, with no corresponding increase in asthma deaths.","Davies, Gwyneth A; Alsallakh, Mohammad A; Sivakumaran, Shanya; Vasileiou, Eleftheria; Lyons, Ronan A; Robertson, Chris; Sheikh, Aziz",Thorax,258,16

Here, we review how knowledge gained from these approaches, including viral RNA quantification and sequence analyses, have been rapidly applied to study SARS-CoV-2 and the COVID-19 pandemic. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies have shown detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in blood of infected individuals by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR); and, as in HIV-1 infection, there is growing evidence that the level of viral RNA in plasma may be related to COVID disease severity. Unlike HIV-1, SARS-CoV-2 sequences are highly conserved limiting SARS-CoV-2 sequencing applications to investigating interpatient genetic diversity for phylogenetic analysis. Sensitive sequencing technologies, originally developed for HIV-1, will be needed to investigate intrapatient SARS-CoV-2 genetic variation in response to antiviral therapeutics and vaccines. SUMMARY: Methods used for HIV-1 have been rapidly applied to SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 to understand pathogenesis and prognosis. Further application of such methods should improve precision of therapy and outcome.","McCormick, Kevin D; Mellors, John W; Jacobs, Jana L",Curr Opin HIV AIDS,258,1

We report a case of significant disease burden and the associated cachexia and evidence of malnutrition in a young 36-year-old male with Somalian heritage with no pre-existing medical conditions but presenting with severe COVID-19 during the first wave of the pandemic (March 2020). We highlight some key nutritional challenges during the critical phase of illness signposting to some of the management instigated to counter this. These considerations are hoped to provide further insight to help continue to evolve nutritional management when treating patients with COVID-19. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

In recent months, new works have tried to clarify what happens at the fetal-placental level in women positive for the virus, and different pathogenesis mechanisms have been proposed. Here, we present the results of a large series of placentas of Coronavirus disease (COVID) positive women, in a reference center for COVID-positive pregnancies, on which we conducted histological, immunohistochemical and electron microscopy investigations. A case-control study was conducted in order to highlight any histopathological alterations attributable to SARS-CoV-2. The prevalence of maternal vascular malperfusion was not significantly different between cases and controls (54.3% vs. 43.7% p = 0.19), whereas the differences with regard to fetal vascular malperfusion (21.1% vs. 4.2% p < 0.001) were significant. More frequent in cases with respect to controls were decidual arteriopathy (40.9% vs. 1.4% p < 0.0001), decidual inflammation (32.4% vs. 0.7% p < 0.0001), perivillous fibrin deposition (36.6% vs. 3.5% p < 0.0001) and fetal vessel thrombi (22.5% vs. 0.7% p < 0.0001). No significant differences in the percentage of terminal villous hyperplasia and chorioamnionitis were observed between the two groups.

Although the disease is asymptomatic in most cases, some patients develop life-threatening disease characterised by acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, multisystem organ failure (MSOF), extrapulmonary manifestations, thromboembolic disease and associated cytokine release syndrome. The rationale for applying therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) early in the course of fulminant COVID-19 is the suppression of thromboinflammation and amelioration of microangiopathy, thus preventing the ensuing MSOF. In the course of complicated critical illness due to COVID-19, immune dysregulation may be as important as viral replication itself. Moreover, the natural course of SARS-CoV-2 infection remains obscure, as re-infections and/or recurrently positive real-time PCR results have been reported. Although concerns still exist regarding its potential immunosuppressive effects and safety, TPE shows promise in the management of life-threatening COVID-19 as documented by various pilot studies, which remain to be confirmed by future randomised controlled trials. However, current data suggest that TPE could be an adjunctive rescue therapy in complex COVID-19 critical illness.","Memish, Ziad A; Faqihi, Fahad; Alharthy, Abdulrahman; Alqahtani, Saleh A; Karakitsos, Dimitrios",Int J Antimicrob Agents,258,13

Method: This retrospective observational multi-centric study analysed patient data collected from clinicians belonging to different specialties in Bangalore, India. The data included the presentation and management of patients presenting with aggressive maxillofacial and rhino-cerebro-orbital fungal infections and explored the relationship between SARS-CoV-2, corticosteroid administration and uncontrolled diabetes mellitus. Results: All 18 patients were Covid positive. Sixteen of the 18 patients received steroids for Covid treatment and 16 patients were diabetic (of whom 15 patients who were diabetics received steroids for Covid-19 treatment). Loss of vision was noted in 12 of the 18 patients and 7 of them underwent orbital exenteration. The fungi noted was mucormycosis in 16 patients, aspergillosis in 1 patient and a mixed fungal infection in 1 patient. Eleven of the patients survived, 6 died and 1 was lost to follow-up.

We conducted an exploratory single-center analysis to estimate the change in number of new stroke diagnoses in our region, and evaluate the proximate reasons for this change during the COVID-19 pandemic at a tertiary care center in New Jersey. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A Comprehensive Stroke Center prospective cohort was retrospectively analyzed for the number of stroke admissions, demographic features, and short-term outcomes 5 months prior to 3/1/2020 (pre-COVID-19), and in the 6 weeks that followed (COVID-19 period). The primary outcome was the number of new acute stroke diagnoses before and during the COVID-19 period, as well as the potential reasons for a decline in the number of new diagnoses. RESULTS: Of the 328 included patients, 53 (16%) presented in the COVID-19 period. There was a mean fall of 38% in new stroke diagnoses (mean 1.13/day [SD 1.07] from 1.82/day [SD 1.38], p<0.01), which was related to a 59% decline in the number of daily transfers from referral centers (p<0.01), 25% fewer telestroke consultations (p=0.08), and 55% fewer patients presenting directly to our institution by private vehicle (p<0.01) and 29% fewer patients through emergency services (p=0.09). There was no significant change in the monthly number of strokes due to large vessel occlusion (LVO), however the proportion of new LVOs nearly doubled in the COVID-19 period (38% vs. 21%, p=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The observations at our tertiary care center corroborate anecdotal reports that the number of new stroke diagnoses is falling, which seems related to a smaller proportion of patients seeking healthcare services for milder symptoms. These preliminary data warrant validation in larger, multi-center studies.","Siegler, J E; Heslin, M E; Thau, L; Smith, A; Jovin, T G",J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis,258,21

Type 2 Stickler Syndrome results from a mutation in the gene coding for &#945;-1 type XI pro-collagen, which has been identified in the human vitreous, cartilage and the cochlea of the mouse. The condition is characterised by classic ocular abnormalities, auditory dysfunction, osteoarthropathy and oro-facial dysplasia. METHODS: This is a population study which used a combination of audiometric, tympanometric, and self-report measures on a series of 65 individuals (mean age 29.2 years, range 3-70, female 63.1%) with genetically confirmed type 2 Stickler Syndrome. RESULTS: Hearing impairment was identified in at least one ear for 69% of individuals. Analysis against age-matched normative data showed that reduced hearing sensitivity was present across all test frequencies. Sensorineural hearing loss was most common (77% of ears), with conductive (3%), mixed (7%) and no hearing loss (13%), respectively. The proportion of hypermobile tympanic membranes (24%) was less than previously documented in type 1 Stickler Syndrome. When present, this appears to arise as a direct result of collagen abnormalities in the middle ear. Self-report measures of speech and spatial hearing in sound were comparable to a non-syndromic cohort with similar audiometric thresholds. CONCLUSIONS: Auditory impairment in type 2 Stickler Syndrome is predominantly associated with cochlear hearing loss of varying severities across affected individuals. The impact on hearing thresholds can be seen across the frequency range, suggesting a contribution of defective collagen throughout the cochlea. Self-report questionnaires showed that difficulties understanding speech, and spatial information in sound (such as that used for localisation), were worse than a young, normal-hearing population but comparable to a non-syndromic cohort with similar audiometric thresholds. Therefore, it is likely that hearing loss in type 2 Stickler Syndrome arises in the auditory periphery, without significant central processing deficits.","Alexander, Philip; Gomersall, Philip; Stancel-Lewis, Jack; Fincham, Gregory Scott; Poulson, Arabella; Richards, Allan; McNinch, Annie; Baguley, David M; Snead, Martin",Eur. arch. oto-rhino-laryngol,258,29

Recently, the Partial Oral Treatment of Endocarditis (POET) trial suggested that partial oral treatment is effective and safe in selected patients. Here, we investigated if such patients are seen in our daily clinical practice. METHODS: We enrolled 119 adult patients diagnosed with left-sided infective endocarditis in a retrospective, observational study. We identified those that would be eligible for switching to partial oral antibiotic treatment as defined in the POET trial (e.g. stable clinical condition without signs of infection). Secondary objectives were to provide insight into the time until each patient was eligible for partial oral treatment, and to determine parameters of longer hospital stay and/or need for extended intravenous antibiotic treatment. RESULTS: Applying the POET selection criteria, the condition of 38 patients (32%) was stable enough to switch them to partial oral treatment, of which 18 (47.3%), 8 (21.1%), 9 (23.7%) and 3 patients (7.9%) were eligible for switching after 10, 14, 21 days or 28 days of intravenous treatment, respectively. CONCLUSION: One-third of patients who presented with left-sided endocarditis in routine clinical practice were possible candidates for switching to partial oral treatment. This could have major implications for both the patient's quality of life and healthcare costs. These results offer an interesting perspective for implementation of such a strategy, which should be accompanied by a prospective cost-effectiveness analysis.","Vroon, J C; Liesdek, O C D; Boel, C H E; Arends, J E; Niessen, F A; van Heusden, H C; Cramer, M J; van der Spoel, T I G; Chamuleau, S A J",Neth. heart j,258,30

Limited availability of kit components, buffers and even plastics has resulted in suboptimal testing procedures worldwide. Alternative workflows have been implemented to overcome these difficulties. Recently a liquid based sample prep has been launched as solution to overcome limitations in relation to nucleic acid extraction. OBJECTIVE: Multicenter evaluation of the QIAprep&amp Viral RNA UM kit (QIA P&A) for rapid sample preparation and real-time PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2 in comparison to standardized laboratory testing methods. STUDY DESIGN: Selected samples of the routine diagnostic workflow at Clinical Microbiology Laboratories of four Dutch hospitals have been subjected to the rapid QIA P&A protocol and the results have been compared to routine diagnostic data. RESULTS: Combining results of manual and automated procedures, a total of 377 clinical samples of which 202 had been tested positive with a wide range of CT values, showed almost complete concordance in the QIA P&A assay for samples up to CT values of 33 with one exception of CT 31. Prospectively 60 samples were tested and also showed 100 % concordance with 5 positives. The method has been automated by two centres.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the choices societies made to protect their community members from the virus could have created contexts of child neglect. With the closure of services and institutions, societies were no longer available to help meet the needs of children. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to examine parents' reports on the response their children received to their needs during the COVID-19 crisis. METHODS: During the period of the spring 2020 lockdown, 414 parents in the province of Quebec, Canada, completed an online questionnaire about the impact of the crisis on the response their children received to their needs. RESULTS: Compared to parents of younger children, parents of older children reported less fulfillment of their child's needs in three measured domains, namely cognitive and affective, security, and basic care needs. CONCLUSION: These results are discussed in light of the policies and the resources societies have put in place during the crisis to help families meet the needs of their children. Societies must learn from this crisis to put children at the top of their priorities in the face of a societal crisis. Thoughtful discussions and energy must be given to ensure that, while facing a crisis, the developmental trajectories of children are not sacrificed.","Bérubé, A; Clément, M-È; Lafantaisie, V; LeBlanc, A; Baron, M; Picher, G; Turgeon, J; Ruiz-Casares, M; Lacharité, C",Child Abuse Negl,258,30

A resurgence in COVID-19 cases has been reported in some countries that lifted some of these NPIs. We aimed to understand the association of introducing and lifting NPIs with the level of transmission of SARS-CoV-2, as measured by the time-varying reproduction number (R), from a broad perspective across 131 countries. METHODS: In this modelling study, we linked data on daily country-level estimates of R from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (London, UK) with data on country-specific policies on NPIs from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker, available between Jan 1 and July 20, 2020. We defined a phase as a time period when all NPIs remained the same, and we divided the timeline of each country into individual phases based on the status of NPIs. We calculated the R ratio as the ratio between the daily R of each phase and the R from the last day of the previous phase (ie, before the NPI status changed) as a measure of the association between NPI status and transmission of SARS-CoV-2. We then modelled the R ratio using a log-linear regression with introduction and relaxation of each NPI as independent variables for each day of the first 28 days after the change in the corresponding NPI. In an ad-hoc analysis, we estimated the effect of reintroducing multiple NPIs with the greatest effects, and in the observed sequence, to tackle the possible resurgence of SARS-CoV-2. FINDINGS: 790 phases from 131 countries were included in the analysis. A decreasing trend over time in the R ratio was found following the introduction of school closure, workplace closure, public events ban, requirements to stay at home, and internal movement limits; the reduction in R ranged from 3% to 24% on day 28 following the introduction compared with the last day before introduction, although the reduction was significant only for public events ban (R ratio 0·76, 95% CI 0·58-1·00); for all other NPIs, the upper bound of the 95% CI was above 1. An increasing trend over time in the R ratio was found following the relaxation of school closure, bans on public events, bans on public gatherings of more than ten people, requirements to stay at home, and internal movement limits; the increase in R ranged from 11% to 25% on day 28 following the relaxation compared with the last day before relaxation, although the increase was significant only for school reopening (R ratio 1·24, 95% CI 1·00-1·52) and lifting bans on public gatherings of more than ten people (1·25, 1·03-1·51); for all other NPIs, the lower bound of the 95% CI was below 1. It took a median of 8 days (IQR 6-9) following the introduction of an NPI to observe 60% of the maximum reduction in R and even longer (17 days [14-20]) following relaxation to observe 60% of the maximum increase in R. In response to a possible resurgence of COVID-19, a control strategy of banning public events and public gatherings of more than ten people was estimated to reduce R, with an R ratio of 0·71 (95% CI 0·55-0·93) on day 28, decreasing to 0·62 (0·47-0·82) on day 28 if measures to close workplaces were added, 0·58 (0·41-0·81) if measures to close workplaces and internal movement restrictions were added, and 0·48 (0·32-0·71) if measures to close workplaces, internal movement restrictions, and requirements to stay at home were added. INTERPRETATION: Individual NPIs, including school closure, workplace closure, public events ban, ban on gatherings of more than ten people, requirements to stay at home, and internal movement limits, are associated with reduced transmission of SARS-CoV-2, but the effect of introducing and lifting these NPIs is delayed by 1-3 weeks, with this delay being longer when lifting NPIs. These findings provide additional evidence that can inform policy-maker decisions on the timing of introducing and lifting different NPIs, although R should be interpreted in the context of its known limitations.

According to the latest clinical research, the respiratory pattern of COVID-19 is different from the respiratory patterns of flu and the common cold. One significant symptom that occurs in the COVID-19 is Tachypnea. People infected with COVID-19 have more rapid respiration. Our study can be utilized to distinguish various respiratory patterns and our device can be preliminarily put to practical use. Demo videos of this method working in situations of one subject and two subjects can be downloaded online. Research details: Accurate detection of the unexpected abnormal respiratory pattern of people in a remote and unobtrusive manner has great significance. In this work, we innovatively capitalize on depth camera and deep learning to achieve this goal. The challenges in this task are twofold: the amount of real-world data is not enough for training to get the deep model; and the intra-class variation of different types of respiratory patterns is large and the outer-class variation is small. In this paper, considering the characteristics of actual respiratory signals, a novel and efficient Respiratory Simulation Model (RSM) is first proposed to fill the gap between the large amount of training data and scarce real-world data. Subsequently, we first apply a GRU neural network with bidirectional and attentional mechanisms (BI-AT-GRU) to classify 6 clinically significant respiratory patterns (Eupnea, Tachypnea, Bradypnea, Biots, Cheyne-Stokes and Central-Apnea). The proposed deep model and the modeling ideas have the great potential to be extended to large scale applications such as public places, sleep scenario, and office environment.","Wang, Yunlu; Hu, Menghan; Li, Qingli; Zhang, Xiao-Ping; Zhai, Guangtao; Yao, Nan",,258,14

As a case study, this paper presents a systematic approach to learn from a typically imbalanced set of CXR images, which consists of a limited number of publicly available COVID-19 images. Our results show that we are able to outperform the top finishers in a related Kaggle multi-class CXR challenge. The proposed methodology should be able to help guide medical personnel in obtaining a robust diagnosis model to discern COVID-19 from other conditions confidently.","Chan, Jonathan H; Li, Chenqi",Methods (S.

Lattice constants found from the theoretical studies of the structure of the undoped and doped CdI2 are in good agreement with those found in the available experimental and theoretical investigations. A strong mixing of I 5p and M 3d states is found after the doping of 3d M in CdI2, which alters the bandgap from positive to negative. Among all M (Ni, Cu, and Zn), Ni doped CdI2 with a narrow negative bandgap evolve the quantum dot level. Due to interactions between the Cd 4d and M 3d states, the measured optical and thermal properties of the doped system assessed with pure CdI2 indicate unusual behaviors, which suggest that the material can be used in different nano-electronic and electrochemical applications and in biological levels such as detection of COVID-19 pathogens. © 2021 Author(s).","Momin, M.

The systemic inflammatory response increases both pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine levels, leading to immune dysregulation and increasing the likelihood of incurring cardiac and pulmonary injuries. AREAS COVERED: Longer periods of hospitalization (~20 days) increase susceptibility to ICU-acquired muscle weakness and deconditioning, which decreases muscle function and functional capacity. These conditions affect the quality of life in the post-COVID-19 period and require multi-disciplinary approaches to rehabilitate the cardiopulmonary and musculoskeletal systems of these patients. In this context, this narrative review, which included articles published in the Embase, PEDro and PubMed databases up to December 2020, is focused on discussing the essential role of exercise and rehabilitation health professionals in the COVID-19 recovery process, from hospitalization to hospital discharge, addressing strategies for professionals to mitigate the cardiac and pulmonary impairments associated with hospitalization to home or ambulatory rehabilitation, purposing ways to conduct rehabilitation programs to restore their functional status and quality of life after the infection. EXPERT OPINION: In the current environment, these findings further point to the vital role of rehabilitation health professionals in the coming years and the urgent need to develop strategies to assist COVID-19 survivors.","Silva, Rebeca Nunes; Goulart, Cássia Da Luz; Oliveira, Murilo Rezende; Tacao, Guilherme Yassuyuki; Back, Guilherme Dionir; Severin, Richard; Faghy, Mark A; Arena, Ross; Borghi-Silva, Audrey",Expert Rev Respir Med,258,3

The overall goal of this paper is to identify key lessons learned to help inform future delivery of remote MI delivery. METHODS: HE perceptions and experiences regarding the transition from in-person to remote delivery of MI for 21 families were captured through a video recorded discussion. Thematic analysis was used to identify themes and subthemes and key learnings from the transition experience. RESULTS: Five themes were identified including: 1) Impact of COVID-19 on families; 2) Scheduling, no-shows, and cancellations; 3) Preference of online video versus phone; 4) Building rapport with remote delivery; 5) HE work satisfaction. Based on these results, several key learnings were identified to improve remote MI-counseling, including using online video platforms versus phone calls, providing families the necessary information and technical support to improve acceptability, using specific strategies to enhance rapport and child engagement, and asking probing questions to elicit deeper reflection. CONCLUSION: Specific considerations regarding rapport building including more frequent check-ins to demonstrate commitment to the family's success, and effective communication strategies including asking more probing questions that elicit complex reflection can support successful transition of MI-counseling from in-person to remote delivery among families with young children. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Our practice recommendations based on key learnings from MI practitioners during the transition from in-person to remote MI-counseling can support healthcare professionals looking to transition MI-counseling services to remote delivery.","Tang, Lisa; Broad, Julia; Lewis, Rebecca; Ma, David W L; Haines, Jess",Patient educ. couns,258,12

BACKGROUND: Workplace violence has emerged as a crucial determinant of turnover intention for health care workers. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among Chinese health care workers (N = 1,063) between 13 and 20 February 2020. Mediation effects were tested using structural equation modelling with weighted least squares mean and variance adjusted (WLSMV) estimator. RESULTS: Workplace violence had both direct and indirect effects on turnover intention among Chinese health care workers. Specifically, perceived social support, mental health and perceived social support together with mental health partially mediated the relationship between workplace violence and turnover intention. CONCLUSIONS: Chinese health care workers experiencing violence during the COVID-19 outbreak were more likely to report turnover intention. Enhancing social support and reducing mental health problems would be beneficial in decreasing the detrimental effects of workplace violence on turnover intention. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: Ensuring health care workers' health and safety is vital in reducing turnover intention, which in turn ascertains continuity of health care delivery.

METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted on patients with positive and negative COVID-19 statuses admitted to Lille University Hospital over 1 month. Pharmaceutical analysis instigated interventions to rectify drug-related errors. For each pharmaceutical intervention (PI), the anatomical therapeutic chemical classification of the drug and the outcome of such an intervention were specified. RESULTS: The study included 438 patients. Prescription analysis led to 188 PIs performed on 118 patients (64 COVID-19-positive patients and 54 COVID-19-negative patients). Most drug-related problems were incorrect dosage representing 36.7% (69/188) of all interventions: 27.9% (29/104) for the COVID-19-positive group and 47.6% (40/84) for the COVID-19-negative group. The most frequent PI in 34% (64/188) of cases was terminating a drug: 27.9% (29/104) for the COVID-19-positive group and 47.6% (40/84) for the COVID-19-negative group. The main drug classes involved were antithrombotic agents (20.7%, 39/188), antibacterials for systemic use (13.8%, 26/188) and drugs for gastric acid-related disorders (6.4%, 12/188). Study population was limited to a single centre over 1 month. CONCLUSION: No difference in PI was noted between the two groups. The presence of pharmacists led to a reduction in drug-related prescription problems, especially for antithrombotic and antibacterial drugs for both groups. Clinical pharmacy commitment in such a pandemic is therefore important.","Perez, Maxime; Masse, Morgane; Deldicque, Anne; Beuscart, Jean Baptiste; De Groote, Pascal; Desbordes, Jacques; Fry, Stéphanie; Musy, Elodie; Odou, Pascal; Puisieux, Francois; Lambert, Marc; Scherpereel, Arnaud; Décaudin, Bertrand",,258,16

Currently, four vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 have been approved by the Paul Ehrlich Institute in Germany, and vaccination campaigns have been started nationwide. In this respect, it is of utmost importance to give recommendations on possible immunological interactions and potential risks of immunomodulatory substances (monoclonal antibodies, biologicals) during concurrent vaccination with the approved vaccines. Methods: This position paper provides specific recommendations on the use of immunomodulatory drugs in the context of concurrent SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations based on current literature. Results: The recommendations are covering the following conditions in which biologicals are indicated and approved: i) chronic inflammatory skin diseases (atopic dermatitis, chronic spontaneous urticaria), ii) bronchial asthma, and iii) chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP). Patients with atopic dermatitis or chronic spontaneous urticaria are not at increased risk for allergic reactions after COVID-19 vaccination. Nevertheless, vaccination may result in transient eczema exacerbation due to general immune stimulation. Vaccination in patients receiving systemic therapy with biologicals can be performed. Patients with severe asthma and concomitant treatment with biologicals also do not have an increased risk of allergic reaction following COVID-19 vaccination which is recommended in these patients. Patients with CRSwNP are also not known to be at increased risk for allergic vaccine reactions, and continuation or initiation of a treatment with biologicals is also recommended with concurrent COVID-19 vaccination. In general, COVID-19 vaccination should be given within the interval between two applications of the respective biological, that is, with a time-lag of at least 1 week after the previous or at least 1 week before the next biological treatment planned. Conclusion: Biologicals for the treatment of atopic dermatitis, chronic spontaneous urticaria, bronchial asthma, and CRSwNP should be continued during the current COVID-19 vaccination campaigns. However, the intervals of biological treatment may need to be slightly adjusted (DGAKI/AeDA recommendations as of March 22, 2021). © 2021 Dustri-Verlag Dr. Karl Feistle.","Pfaar, O.; Klimek, L.; Hamelmann, E.; Kleine-Tebbe, J.; Taube, C.; Wagenmann, M.; Werfel, T.; Brehler, R.; Novak, N.; Mülleneisen, N.; Becker, S.; Worm, M.",Allergologie,258,3

As some AgPOCTs have become available, interest is growing in their utility and performance. Here we aimed to compare the analytical sensitivity and specificity of seven commercially available AgPOCT devices. Methods: In a single-centre, laboratory evaluation study, we compared AgPOCT products from seven suppliers: the Abbott Panbio COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test, the RapiGEN BIOCREDIT COVID-19 Ag, the Healgen Coronavirus Ag Rapid Test Cassette (Swab), the Coris BioConcept COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip, the R-Biopharm RIDA QUICK SARS-CoV-2 Antigen, the nal von minden NADAL COVID-19 Ag Test, and the Roche-SD Biosensor SARS-CoV Rapid Antigen Test. Tests were evaluated on recombinant SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein, cultured endemic and emerging coronaviruses, stored respiratory samples with known SARS-CoV-2 viral loads, stored samples from patients with respiratory pathogens other than SARS-CoV-2, and self-sampled swabs from healthy volunteers. We estimated analytical sensitivity in terms of approximate viral concentrations (quantified by real-time RT-PCR) that yielded positive AgPOCT results, and specificity in terms of propensity to generate false-positive results. Findings: In 138 clinical samples with quantified SARS-CoV-2 viral load, the 95% limit of detection (concentration at which 95% of test results were positive) in six of seven AgPOCT products ranged between 2·07 × 106 and 2·86 × 107 copies per swab, with an outlier (RapiGEN) at 1·57 × 1010 copies per swab. The assays showed no cross-reactivity towards cell culture or tissue culture supernatants containing any of the four endemic human coronaviruses (HCoV­229E, HCoV­NL63, HCoV­OC43, or HCoV­HKU1) or MERS-CoV, with the exception of the Healgen assay in one repeat test on HCoV-HKU1 supernatant. SARS-CoV was cross-detected by all assays. Cumulative specificities among stored clinical samples with non-SARS-CoV-2 infections (n=100) and self-samples from healthy volunteers (n=35; cumulative sample n=135) ranged between 98·5% (95% CI 94·2-99·7) and 100·0% (97·2-100·0) in five products, with two outliers at 94·8% (89·2-97·7; R-Biopharm) and 88·9% (82·1-93·4; Healgen). False-positive results did not appear to be associated with any specific respiratory pathogen. Interpretation: The sensitivity range of most AgPOCTs overlaps with SARS-CoV-2 viral loads typically observed in the first week of symptoms, which marks the infectious period in most patients. The AgPOCTs with limit of detections that approximate virus concentrations at which patients are infectious might enable shortcuts in decision making in various areas of health care and public health.

We conducted a secondary analysis of a cross-sectional, nationally representative survey of Internet users to evaluate whether there were racial/ethnic disparities in self-reported telehealth use early in the pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Pew Research Center fielded the survey March 19-24, 2020. Telehealth use because of the pandemic was measured by asking whether respondents (N = 10,624) ""used the internet or email to connect with doctors or other medical professionals as a result of the coronavirus outbreak."" We conducted survey-weighted logistic regressions, adjusting for respondents' socioeconomic characteristics and perceived threat of the pandemic to their own health (no threat, minor, major). RESULTS: Approximately 17% of respondents reported using telehealth because of the pandemic, with significantly higher unadjusted odds among Blacks, Latinos, and those identified with other race compared to White respondents. The multivariable logistic regressions and sensitivity analyses show Black respondents were more likely than Whites to report using telehealth because of the pandemic, particularly when perceiving the pandemic as a minor threat to their own health. DISCUSSION: Black respondents are most likely to report using telehealth because of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly when they perceive the pandemic as a minor health threat. CONCLUSION: The systemic racism creating health and health care disparities has likely raised the need for telehealth among Black patients during the pandemic. Findings suggest opportunities to leverage a broadly defined set of telehealth tools to reduce health care disparities post-pandemic.","Campos-Castillo, Celeste; Anthony, Denise",J. am. med. inform. assoc,258,29

One aspect was the cancellation of in-person scientific conferences and the rapid replacement of some into virtual conferences. The aim of this study is to highlight the opportunities that virtual conferences can bring to animal behaviour and welfare research, with a focus on regional diversity and early career researchers (ECRs). The ISAE 2020 virtual meeting was used as a case study. Firstly, conference attendance was compared to the ISAE 2019 in-person international congress. Secondly, a post-conference survey was conducted (n = 142 responses). Data were analysed quantitatively (multinomial models) and qualitatively (word classifications). The organisation by geographical region attracted many non-local attendees and positive feedback was received on the global perspective. The participation from the ISAE developing regions AFRICA (Africa/Central Asia/Middle East), ASIA (South/East/Southeast Asia) and LATAM (Latin America) was higher as compared to the in-person conference (p < 0.001). The most valued advantage for the virtual conference was the reduced cost, followed by the increased ability to participate and the reduced environmental footprint. The most valued advantages did not differ between regions or attendees of different career stages, but an interaction showed that the ability to participate was more appreciated by ECRs in developing regions (p < 0.05). Over 75% of the respondents ranked the absence of social interaction as the most important disadvantage. Respondents from developed regions were more likely to attend a future virtual conference with a registration fee as compared to those from developing regions (p < 0.05). Respondents most enjoyed the organisation, flexibility, quality of presentations and regional diversity from their virtual experience. This study showed that within applied animal behaviour and welfare science, the virtual format of an international conference can promote participation from diverse regions, especially from less financially privileged groups, but attention should be paid to enhance the social element of a virtual conference.","Chou, J.

Methods: Baseline demographics and clinicopathological data of eligible patients were retrieved from medical records. Information of clinical manifestations, history of epidemiology, lab tests and chest CT scan images of visiting patients from February 13 to February 28 were collected. Literatures about pulmonary infiltrates in cancer patients were searched from databases including PUBMED, EMBASE and CNKI. Results: Among the 139 cancer patients who underwent chest CT scans before chemotherapy, pulmonary infiltrates were identified in eight patients (5.8%), five of whom were characterized with GGOs in lungs. 2019-nCoV nuclear acid testing was performed in three patients and the results were negative. One case was a 66-year-old man who was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma and underwent CHOP chemotherapy regimen. His chest CT scan image displayed multiple GGOs in lungs and the complete blood count showed decreased lymphocytes. This patient denied any contact with confirmed/suspected cases of 2019-nCoV infection, fever or other respiratory symptoms. Considering the negative result of nuclear acid testing, this patient was presumptively diagnosed with viral pneumonia and an experiential anti-infection treatment had been prescribed for him. Conclusions: The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) complicates the clinical scenario of pulmonary infiltrates in cancer patients. The epidemic history, clinical manifestation, CT scan image and lab test should be taken into combined consideration. The 2019-nCoV nuclear acid testing might be applied in more selected patients.

With over 800 new daily hospitalizations at the peak in Los Angeles (LA) County, the potential for high use of COVID-19 treatment agents, remdesivir and dexamethasone, warranted a screening assessment of their fate and toxicity risk for aquatic organisms. We predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) using the ChemFate model and hospitalizations data and compared them to predicted ecotoxicity concentrations generated using Ecological Structure Activity Relationships (ECOSAR) to assess risk to potentially exposed organisms. The lowest predicted toxicity thresholds were between 2 and 11 orders of magnitude greater than the highest PECs for freshwater and saltwater. We conclude that had all eligible patients in LA County been given the recommended treatment regimen, exposure of aquatic organisms in regional water bodies to remdesivir, dexamethasone, and their evaluated metabolites would not be likely to be affected based on ECOSAR predictions. Conservative, protective assumptions were used for this screening analysis, considering limited toxicity information. Modeling tools thus serve to predict environmental concentrations and estimate ecotoxicity risks of novel treatment agents and can provide useful preliminary data to assess and manage ecological health risks.","Desgens-Martin, Violaine; Keller, Arturo A.",ACS ES T Water,258,22

TRIAL DESIGN: Randomized clinical trial, controlled, open, parallel group, to evaluate the effectiveness of steroids in adult patients with confirmed COVID-19, with incipient pulmonary involvement, without hospital admission criteria. Patients will be stratified by the presence or not of radiological data on pneumonia. PARTICIPANTS: We will include patients with early stage SARS-Cov-2 pneumonia who do not meet hospital admission criteria from the reference hospital, the Hospital Universitario de Burgos, in the region of Castilla y León, Spain. Patients will be followed-up by specialist physicians and Primary Health Care professionals. Inclusion criteria: - Men and women. - Age between 18 and 75 years old. - Diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infection, by PCR and/or IgM+ antibody test and/or antigen test. - Clinical diagnosis of lung involvement: (respiratory symptoms +/- pathological auscultation +/- O2 desaturation) - Chest X-ray with mild-moderate alterations or normal. - Patients who give their verbal informed consent in front of witnesses, which will be reflected in the patients’ medical records. Exclusion criteria: - Oxygen desaturation below 93% or P0(2) < 62. - Moderate-severe dyspnea or significant respiratory or general deterioration that makes admission advisable. - Chest X-ray with multifocal infiltrates. - Insulin-dependent diabetes with poor control or glycaemia in the emergency room test greater than 300 mg/ml (fasting or not). - Other significant comorbidities: Severe renal failure (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min); cirrhosis or chronic liver disease, poorly controlled hypertension. - Heart rhythm disturbances (including prolonged QT). - Severe immunosuppression (HIV infection, long-term use of immunosuppressive agents); cancer. - Pregnant or breast-feeding women. - Patients under use of glucocorticoids for other diseases. - History of allergy or intolerance to any of the drugs in the study (prednisone, azithromycin or hydroxychloroquine). - Patients who took one or more of the study drugs in the 7 days prior to study inclusion. - Patients taking non-suppressible drugs with risk of QT prolongation or significant interactions. - Patients unwilling or unable to participate until study completion. - Participation in another study. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Eligible patients will be randomized to receive standard outpatient treatment only (group 1) or standard outpatient treatment plus prednisone (group 2). - Group 1: paracetamol 1 g/8 h (on demand) + hydroxychloroquine 400 mg/12h the first day, 200 mg/12 h for 4 days + azithromycin 500 mg/24h for 5 days. - Group 2: paracetamol 1 g/8 h (on demand) + hydroxychloroquine 400 mg/12h the first day, 200 mg/12 h for 4 days + azithromycin 500 mg/24h for 5 days + prednisone 60 mg / 24 h for 3 days, 30 mg / 24 h for 3 days and 15 mg / 24 h for 3 days. MAIN OUTCOMES: If the patient requires ambulatory observation, according to the protocol established in this respect in the Emergency Department, meets all the criteria for inclusion and none for exclusion, data will be taken by the person responsible on the data collection sheet. The main result is admission after 30 days. Secondary outcomes are 30-day ICU admission and hospital stay. The safety variable will be the occurrence of clinical symptoms or delirium related to the steroids. Also, the possible decompensations of diabetes will be measured. All tests will be on an intention-to-treat basis. RANDOMISATION: Treatment will be assigned according to stratified randomization by the presence or absence of radiological data of lung involvement (previously performed by random sequence 1:1 generated with Epidat and kept hidden by opaque, sealed envelopes, which will only be opened after inclusion and basal measurement). BLINDING (MASKING): Participants, caregivers and personnel responsible for outcomes measurement will not be blinded to group assignment, once the patient is included and the basal measurement performed, as per protocol design. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): The percentage of patients with incipient lung involvement is unknown, but given that pulmonary involvement already exists it is estimated to be around 20%. We consider that the intervention could reduce this percentage to 5%, so the necessary sample size would be 200 subjects (100 per group), with a power of 80% and an estimated loss percentage of 10%. TRIAL STATUS: The protocol with code TAC-COVID-19, version 2.0 on date: April 16, 2020 is approved by the Spanish Drug Agency (AEMPS) and the local Ethics Committee. The trial is in the recruitment phase. Recruitment began 19 April, 2020 and is anticipated to be complete by April 2021.

Here we investigated the molecular characteristics and pathogenicity of two newly isolated GVI-1 type IBV virus strains (CK/CH/TJ1904 and CK/CH/NP2011) from infected chicken farms in China. Genetic evolution analysis of the S1 gene showed the highest homology with the GVI-1 representative strain, TC07-2. Phylogenetic analysis and recombination analysis of the virus genomes indicated that newly isolated strains in China may be independently derived from recombination events that occurred between GI-19 and GI-22 strains and early GVI-1 viruses. Interestingly, unlike the deduced parental GI-19 or GI-22 strains, CK/CH/TJ1904 and CK/CH/NP2011 showed affinity for the trachea rather than the kidney and were less pathogenic. This difference may be because of recombination events that occurred during the long co-existence of the GVI-1 viruses with prevalent GI-19 and GI-22 strains. Considering the new trend, it is very important to permanently monitor circulating strains and to develop new vaccines to counteract emerging new-type IBVs.","Sun, Lu; Tang, Xinyan; Qi, Jingyi; Zhang, Chunyan; Zhao, Jing; Zhang, Guozhong; Zhao, Ye",Infect Genet Evol,258,1

We compared the performance of AdvanSure with those of Seeplex® RV 15 ACE and culture by determining their sensitivities and specificities against a composite reference standard. Four hundred thirty-seven respiratory samples were tested by modified shell vial culture method, RV 15 ACE, and AdvanSure. One hundred fourteen samples (26.2%) out of 437 samples were positive by culture, while additional 91 (20.8%) were positive by AdvanSure or RV15. One hundred twelve of 114 culture-positive samples were positive by AdvanSure except 2 samples (1 adenovirus, 1 respiratory syncytial virus [RSV]). Overall, the sensitivities of culture, RV15, and AdvanSure were 74.5%, 89.8%, and 95.1%, respectively. Sensitivities of culture, RV15, and AdvanSure for each virus tested were as follows: 91/100/96% for influenza A, 60/0/100% for influenza B, 63/95/97% for RSV, 69/81/89% for adenovirus, and 87/93/93% for parainfluenza virus. For viruses not covered by culture, sensitivities of RV15 and AdvanSure were as follows: 77/88% for rhinovirus, 100/100% for coronavirus OC43, 40/100% for coronavirus 229E/NL63, 13/100% for metapneumovirus, and 44/100% for bocavirus. The overall specificities of culture, RV15, and AdvanSure were 100/98.9/99.5%, respectively. Of 45 coinfected specimens, AdvanSure detected 41 specimens (91.1%) as coinfected, while RV15 detected 27 specimens (60.0%) as coinfected. AdvanSure assay demonstrated exquisite performance for the detection of RVs and will be a valuable tool for the management of RV infection.","Cho, Chi Hyun; Lee, Chang Kyu; Nam, Myung-Hyun; Yoon, Soo-Young; Lim, Chae Seung; Cho, Yunjung; Kim, Young Kee",Diagn Microbiol Infect Dis,258,16

In this experiment, we tested the impact of consensus messages on skeptics’ climate beliefs and attitudes and investigated how the decision to pretest initial climate beliefs and attitudes prior to consensus message exposure may influence results. We found that although consensus messages led individuals to report higher scientific agreement estimates, total effects on key variables were likely an artifact of study design; consensus messages only affected climate attitudes and beliefs when they were measured both before and after message exposure. In the absence of a pretest, we did not observe significant total effects of consensus messages on climate outcomes. These results highlight the limitations of consensus messaging strategies at reducing political polarization and the importance of experimental designs that mimic real-world contexts.

To this end, we created a risk-prediction nomogram model. METHODS: A national multicentre study was conducted through an online questionnaire involving 12,186 children (6-11 years old) and adolescents (12-16 years old). Respondents’ psychosocial and behavioural functioning were assessed using the Achenbach Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL). Data were analysed using STATA software and R-language. RESULTS: The positive detection rate of psychological problems within Wuhan was greater than that outside Wuhan for schizoid (P = 0.005), and depression (P = 0.030) in children, and for somatic complaints (P = 0.048), immaturity (P = 0.023), and delinquent behaviour (P = 0.046) in adolescents. After graded multivariable adjustment, seven factors associated with psychological problems in children and adolescents outside Wuhan were parent-child conflict (odds ratio (OR): 4.94, 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 4.27-5.72), sleep problems (OR: 4.05, 95% CI: 3.77-4.36), online study time (OR: 0.41, 95% CI: 0.37-0.47), physical activity time (OR: 0.510, 95% CI: 0.44-0.59), number of close friends (OR: 0.51, 95% CI: 0.44-0.6), time spent playing videogames (OR: 2.26, 95% CI: 1.90-2.69) and eating disorders (OR: 2.71, 95% CI: 2.35-3.11) (all P < 0.001). Contrastingly, within Wuhan, only the first four factors, namely, parent-child conflict (5.95, 2.82-12.57), sleep problems (4.47, 3.06-6.54), online study time (0.37, 0.22-0.64), and physical activity time (0.42, 0.22-0.80) were identified (all P < 0.01). Accordingly, nomogram models were created with significant attributes and had decent prediction performance with C-indexes over 80%. LIMITATION: A cross-sectional study and self-reported measures. CONCLUSIONS: Besides the four significant risk factors within and outside Wuhan, the three additional factors outside Wuhan deserve special attention.

This study aims to investigate the sleep status of Chinese residents during the outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and to evaluate its related risk factors. METHODS: This research carried out a cross-sectional survey in February 2020 (during the COVID-19 outbreak) to investigate the sleep status of residents nationwide in the form of an online questionnaire. Of the 8,151 respondents, 6,437 were eventually included in the analysis. Logistic regression is applied to analyze the associated factors affecting residents’ sleep quality. RESULTS: During the COVID-19 outbreak, the incidence of sleep disturbances in residents was 17.65%. Increased risk of sleep disturbances was found to be associated with older age, female gender, and poor self-reported health status. Moreover, the odds ratios (ORs) were 1.42 (95%CI: 1.1-2.64), 1.35 (95%CI: 1.16-1.59), 5.59 (95%CI: 4.32-7.23), respectively. Those residents who believed COVID-19 had caused a high number of deaths or who thought COVID-19 was not easy to cure were more likely to experience sleep disorders, and the ORs were 1.73 (95%CI: 1.43-2.09), 1.57 (95%CI: 1.29-1.91), respectively. Regular exercise was a protective factor for sleep disturbances, OR =0.77 (95%CI: 0.63-0.93). CONCLUSIONS: During the outbreak of COVID-19, nearly one-fifth of participants had sleep disorders. It is necessary to pay more attention to people at high risk for sleep disturbances during the outbreak, adopt effective risk communication methods, enhance residents’ rational understanding of COVID-19, and develop practical indoor exercise programs for general public to improve sleep quality.","Wang, Jing; Gong, Yanhong; Chen, Zhenyuan; Wu, Jianxiong; Feng, Jie; Yan, Shijiao; Lv, Chuanzhu; Lu, Zuxun; Mu, Ketao; Yin, Xiaoxv",Sleep Med,258,1

In South Korea, PGAR is prevalent in piglets naturally infected with PEDV. Piglets naturally co-infected with PEDV and PGAR appeared to have severe and prolonged diarrhea that was distinct from that commonly observed. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of PGAR co-infection on PEDV pathogenicity in piglets. Thirty-six colostrum-deprived, one-day old, Large White-Duroc crossbred pigs were randomly divided into four equal groups: PEDV, PEDV/PGAR, PGAR, and control groups. The piglets were euthanized at 1, 2, or 3 days post-inoculation (DPI) to measure the villous height:crypt depth (VH:CD) ratio and to collect fecal samples for RT-PCR and virus isolation. No significant differences in mean VH:CD ratio and clinical symptoms (diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, and anorexia) were observed between the PEDV/PGAR-infected and PEDV-infected groups of piglets at 1, 2 and 3 DPI; however, at 2 and 3 DPI, PGAR was detected in all fecal samples by RT-PCR and virus isolation. These findings failed to detect any interaction between PEDV and porcine rotavirus in the small intestines of piglets, suggesting that concurrent infection of PGAR may not synergistically enhance intestinal villous atrophy of piglets with PEDV disease. We propose that the severe diarrhea exhibited in PEDV and PGAR co-infected piglets may be more associated with the immunity level of the host rather than to any synergistic effect of PGAR on PEDV enteritis.","Jung, Kwonil; Kang, Bo-Kyu; Lee, Chul-Seung; Song, Dae-Sub",Res Vet Sci,258,18

Our previous work showed a novel vaccine candidate, liposomal adjuvant DMT emulsified with a multistage antigen CMFO, could protect mice against primary progressive TB, latency, and reactivation. To develop a more effective vaccine against adult TB, we aimed to further understand the role of pattern recognition receptor (PRR) agonists monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA) and trehalose-6,6’-dibehenate (TDB) of the liposomal adjuvant DMT in the CMFO subunit vaccine-induced protection. Using C57BL/6 mouse models, the current study prepared different dimethyldioctadecylammonium (DDA)–based liposomal adjuvants with MPLA, TDB, or both (DMT), and then compared the immunogenicity and the protective efficacy among different liposomal adjuvanted CMFO subunit vaccines. Our study demonstrated that CMFO/DMT provided stronger and longer-lasting protective efficacy than the CMFO emulsified with adjuvants DDA or DDA/TDB. In addition, DDA/MPLA adjuvanted CMFO conferred a comparable protection in the lung as CMFO/DMT did. Higher levels of IFN-γ, IL-2, TNF-α, and IL-17A secreted by splenocytes were related with a more powerful and durable protection induced by CMFO/DMT through a putative synergistic effect of both MPLA and TDB via binding to TLR4 and Mincle. IL-2(+) CD4(+) T cells, especially IL-2(+) CD4(+) T(CM) cells, in the lung after infection were significantly associated with the vaccine-induced protection, whereas stronger IL-10 response and lower IL-2(+) CD4(+) T cells also contributed to the inferior protection of the DDA/TDB adjuvanted CMFO subunit vaccine. Given their crucial roles in vaccine-induced protection, combinational different PRR agonists in adjuvant formulation represent a promising strategy for the development of next-generation TB vaccine.","Hao, Ling; Wu, Yaqi; Zhang, Yandi; Zhou, Zijie; Lei, Qing; Ullah, Nadeem; Banga Ndzouboukou, Jo-Lewis; Lin, Xiaosong; Fan, Xionglin",Front Immunol,258,16

Currently, there are no treatments or vaccines available for the treatment of FIP even though it kills approximately 5% of cats in multi-cat households per year. In an effort to develop small molecule drugs targeting FIP for the treatment of cats, we screened a small set of designed peptidomimetic inhibitors for inhibition of FIPV-3CL(pro), identifying two compounds with low to sub-micromolar inhibition, compound 6 (IC(50)= 0.59 ± 0.06 nM) and compound 7 (IC(50)= 1.3 ± 0.1 μM). We determined the first X-ray crystal structure of FIPV-3CL(pro) in complex with the best inhibitor identified, compound 6, to a resolution of 2.10 Å to better understand the structural basis for inhibitor specificity. Our study provides important insights into the structural requirements for the inhibition of FIPV-3CL(pro) by peptidomimetic inhibitors and expands the current structural knowledge of coronaviral 3CL(pro) architecture.","St. John, Sarah E.; Therkelsen, Matthew D.; Nyalapatla, Prasanth R.; Osswald, Heather L.; Ghosh, Arun K.; Mesecar, Andrew D.",Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry Letters,258,33

In the context of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, NK cells and CMV have co-evolved side by side to employ several mechanisms to evade one another. However, during this co-evolution the discovery of a subset of long-lived NK cells with enhanced effector potential, increased antibody-dependent responses and the potential to mediate immune memory has revolutionized the field of NK cell biology. The ability of a virus to imprint on the NK cell receptor repertoire resulting in the expansion of diverse, highly functional NK cells to this day remains a significant immunological phenomenon that only occurs in the context of CMV. Here we review our current understanding of the development of these NK cells, commonly referred to as adaptive NK cells and their current role in transplantation, infection, vaccination and cancer immunotherapy to decipher the complex role of CMV in dictating NK cell functional fate.","Barnes, Samantha; Schilizzi, Ophelia; Audsley, Katherine M.; Newnes, Hannah V.; Foley, Bree",Int J Mol Sci,258,1

Results A 42.5% reduction in emergency department visits was observed. In 2020, only 196 patients visited the pediatric surgery emergency department, versus 341 patients in 2019 (p<0.05). The reasons for visiting the emergency department did not change in most categories. Even though visits to the emergency department were reduced, the rates of the distance of the patient’s residency from the hospital remained roughly the same. Hospital admission rates remained roughly the same. Conclusion Even though there was a huge decrease in numbers, the reasons for visiting the ED remained roughly the same.

We carried out proteomic profiling of plasma from cross-sectional and longitudinal cohorts of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and analyzed clinical data from our health system database of more than 3300 patients. Using a machine learning algorithm, we identified a prominent signature of neutrophil activation, including resistin, lipocalin-2, hepatocyte growth factor, interleukin-8, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, which were the strongest predictors of critical illness. Evidence of neutrophil activation was present on the first day of hospitalization in patients who would only later require transfer to the intensive care unit, thus preceding the onset of critical illness and predicting increased mortality. In the health system database, early elevations in developing and mature neutrophil counts also predicted higher mortality rates. Altogether, these data suggest a central role for neutrophil activation in the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 and identify molecular markers that distinguish patients at risk of future clinical decompensation.","Meizlish, Matthew L.; Pine, Alexander B.; Bishai, Jason D.; Goshua, George; Nadelmann, Emily R.; Simonov, Michael; Chang, C-Hong; Zhang, Hanming; Shallow, Marcus; Bahel, Parveen; Owusu, Kent; Yamamoto, Yu; Arora, Tanima; Atri, Deepak S.; Patel, Amisha; Gbyli, Rana; Kwan, Jennifer; Won, Christine H.; Dela Cruz, Charles; Price, Christina; Koff, Jonathan; King, Brett A.; Rinder, Henry M.; Wilson, F.

This task is challenging due to outdoor scenes with high complexity and point clouds with irregular distribution. Many existing methods based on deep learning techniques have drawbacks, such as complex pre/post-processing steps, an expensive sampling cost, and a limited receptive field size. In this paper, we propose a graph attention feature fusion network (GAFFNet) that can achieve a satisfactory classification performance by capturing wider contextual information of the ALS point cloud. Based on the graph attention mechanism, we first design a neighborhood feature fusion unit and an extended neighborhood feature fusion block, which effectively increases the receptive field for each point. On this basis, we further design a neural network based on encoder-decoder architecture to obtain the semantic features of point clouds at different levels, allowing us to achieve a more accurate classification. We evaluate the performance of our method on a publicly available ALS point cloud dataset provided by the International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ISPRS). The experimental results show that our method can effectively distinguish nine types of ground objects. We achieve more satisfactory results on different evaluation metrics when compared with the results obtained via other approaches.","Yang, Jie; Zhang, Xinchang; Huang, Yun",Sensors (Basel),258,16

Methods: We conducted an observational study at a Western Connecticut hospital heavily affected by the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic to assess its effects on surgical residents, focusing on surgical education, clinical experience, and operative skills development. Objective data was available through recorded work hours, case logs, and formal didactics. In addition, we created an anonymous survey to assess resident perception of their residency experience during the pandemic. Results: There are 22 surgical residents at our institution; all were included in the study. Resident weekly duty hours decreased by 23.9 hours with the majority of clinical time redirected to caring for COVID-19 patients. Independent studying increased by 1.6 hours (26.2%) while weekly didactics decreased by 2.1 hours (35.6%). The operative volume per resident decreased by 65.7% from 35.0 to 12.0 cases for the period of interest, with a disproportionately high effect on junior residents, who experienced a 76.2% decrease. Unsurprisingly, 70% of residents reported a negative effect of the pandemic on their surgical skills. Conclusions: During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, surgical residents' usual workflows changed dramatically, as much of their time was dedicated to the critical care of patients with COVID-19. However, the consequent opportunity cost was to surgery-specific training; there was a significant decrease in operative cases and time spent in surgical didactics, along with elevated concern about overall preparedness for their intended career.","Ostapenko, A.; McPeck, S.; Liechty, S.; Kleiner, D.",,258,22

The progression from acute respiratory failure to sepsis has been correlated with the release of high-mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1). Lack of effective conventional treatment of this septic state has spiked an interest in alternative medicine. This review of herbal extracts has identified multiple candidates which can target the release of HMGB1 and potentially reduce mortality by preventing progression from respiratory distress to sepsis. Some of the identified mixtures have also been shown to interfere with viral attachment. Due to the wide variability in chemical superstructure of the components of assorted herbal extracts, common motifs have been identified. Looking at the most active compounds in each extract it becomes evident that as a group, phenolic compounds have a broad enzyme inhibiting function. They have been shown to act against the priming of SARS-CoV-2 attachment proteins by host and viral enzymes, and the release of HMGB1 by host immune cells. An argument for the value in a nonspecific inhibitory action has been drawn.

There is thus a need to design long-term reliable BCIs that can be used outside-of-the-lab by end-users, e.g., severely motor-impaired ones. Therefore, we propose and evaluate the design of a multi-class Mental Task (MT)-based BCI for longitudinal training (20 sessions over 3 months) of a tetraplegic user for the CYBATHLON BCI series 2019. In this BCI championship, tetraplegic pilots are mentally driving a virtual car in a racing video game. We aimed at combining a progressive user MT-BCI training with a newly designed machine learning pipeline based on adaptive Riemannian classifiers shown to be promising for real-life applications. We followed a two step training process: the first 11 sessions served to train the user to control a 2-class MT-BCI by performing either two cognitive tasks (REST and MENTAL SUBTRACTION) or two motor-imagery tasks (LEFT-HAND and RIGHT-HAND). The second training step (9 remaining sessions) applied an adaptive, session-independent Riemannian classifier that combined all 4 MT classes used before. Moreover, as our Riemannian classifier was incrementally updated in an unsupervised way it would capture both within and between-session non-stationarity. Experimental evidences confirm the effectiveness of this approach. Namely, the classification accuracy improved by about 30% at the end of the training compared to initial sessions. We also studied the neural correlates of this performance improvement. Using a newly proposed BCI user learning metric, we could show our user learned to improve his BCI control by producing EEG signals matching increasingly more the BCI classifier training data distribution, rather than by improving his EEG class discrimination. However, the resulting improvement was effective only on synchronous (cue-based) BCI and it did not translate into improved CYBATHLON BCI game performances. For the sake of overcoming this in the future, we unveil possible reasons for these limited gaming performances and identify a number of promising future research directions. Importantly, we also report on the evolution of the user's neurophysiological patterns and user experience throughout the BCI training and competition.","Benaroch, Camille; Sadatnejad, Khadijeh; Roc, Aline; Appriou, Aurélien; Monseigne, Thibaut; Pramij, Smeety; Mladenovic, Jelena; Pillette, Léa; Jeunet, Camille; Lotte, Fabien",Front Hum Neurosci,258,1

In studies done elsewhere, it is well established that older people, when compared with younger adults, are at greater risk of significant morbidity and mortality from complications arising from influenza. The main aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and the diversity of respiratory viruses associated with ILI cases in adults over 50 years old in Senegal. METHODS: The recruitment period of this study was from January 2009 to December 2011. 232 patients aged 50 years and above presenting ILI cases were enrolled. Nasal-pharyngeal and/or oral pharyngeal swabs were collected from patients. RNA was extracted from 200 μl of each sample followed by a two-step real-time RT-PCR. The Anyplex™ II RV16 Detection kit was used for viral detection. The kit enabled the simultaneous detection of the presence of 16 respiratory viruses. RESULTS: 150 viruses were detected: influenza viruses (44.7%) and rhinoviruses (26.7%) were the most prevalent. We detected 13 human parainfluenza viruses (8.7%), 7 human respiratory syncytial viruses (4.7%), 6 coronaviruses (4%), 5 human metapneumoviruses (3.3%), 5 human adenoviruses (3.3%) and 1 human bocavirus (0.7%). 14 cases (6%) of dual virus infections and one triple viral detection case were encountered. 56 (56.6%) viruses detected were found in the 50-64 year old age group, 59 (76.6%; P < 0.001) from 65–74 year old age group and 35 (62.5%) were detected in the ≥75 year old age group. The viral co-infections were more frequent in the 65-74 age group (9/15). CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study demonstrates a variety of respiratory viruses in the elderly. It also highlights a high prevalence of these viruses in this age group. We speculate from these results that the impact of respiratory viruses other than influenza on the elderly has been considerably underestimated. A more exhaustive study seems necessary in order to provide a more complete picture of the burden of respiratory viruses on morbidity among adults over 50 years old in the sub-Saharan context.","Dia, Ndongo; Richard, Vincent; Kiori, Davy; Cisse, El Hadj Abdoul Khadir; Sarr, Fatoumata Diène; Faye, Abdourahmane; Goudiaby, Déborah G; Diop, Ousmane M; Niang, Mbayame N",BMC Infect Dis,258,26

Hospital planning may benefit from a greater understanding of this association and the ability to reliably forecast future levels of non-COVID-19 demand. Activity data for Accident and Emergency (A&E) attendances and emergency admissions were sourced for all hospitals within the Bristol, North Somerset and South Gloucestershire healthcare system. These were regressed upon publicly available mobility data obtained from Google's Community Mobility Reports for the local area. Seasonal trends were controlled for using time series decomposition. The models were used to predict non-COVID-19 emergency demand under the UK Government's plan to sequentially lift all restrictions by 21 June 2021, in addition to three alternative hypothetical relaxation strategies. Rates of public mobility within the local area were shown to account for 77% and 65% of the variance in non-COVID-19 related A&E attendances and emergency admissions respectively. Modelling supports an increase in emergency demand in line with the level and timing of societal restrictions, with significant increases to be expected upon the ending of all legal limits. This study finds that non-COVID-19 emergency demand associates with the level of societal restrictions, with rates of public mobility representing a key determinant.

Furthermore, the pathophysiologic mechanisms of asthma in the elderly are likely to be different from those seen in young asthmatic patients, and these differences might influence the clinical course and outcomes of asthma in this population.","Hanania, Nicola A.; King, Monroe J.; Braman, Sidney S.; Saltoun, Carol; Wise, Robert A.; Enright, Paul; Falsey, Ann R.; Mathur, Sameer K.; Ramsdell, Joe W.; Rogers, Linda; Stempel, David A.; Lima, John J.; Fish, James E.; Wilson, Sandra R.; Boyd, Cynthia; Patel, Kushang V.; Irvin, Charles G.; Yawn, Barbara P.; Halm, Ethan A.; Wasserman, Stephen I.; Sands, Mark F.; Ershler, William B.; Ledford, Dennis K.",Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology,258,24

However, the diagnostic process can be challenging due to the high genetic diversity and high mutation rate of PRRSV. A diagnostic method that can provide more detailed genetic information about pathogens is urgently needed. In this study, we evaluated the ability of Oxford Nanopore MinION direct RNA sequencing to generate a PRRSV whole genome sequence and detect and discriminate virus at the strain-level. A nearly full length PRRSV genome was successfully generated from raw sequence reads, achieving an accuracy of 96% after consensus genome generation. Direct RNA sequencing reliably detected the PRRSV strain present with an accuracy of 99.9% using as few as 5 raw sequencing reads and successfully differentiated multiple co-infecting strains present in a sample. In addition, PRRSV strain information was obtained from clinical samples containing 10(4) to 10(6) viral copies or more within 6 hours of sequencing. Overall, direct viral RNA sequencing followed by bioinformatic analysis proves to be a promising approach for identification of the viral strain or strains involved in clinical infections, allowing for more precise prevention and control strategies during PRRSV outbreaks.","Tan, Shaoyuan; Dvorak, Cheryl M.T.; Murtaugh, Michael P.",Viruses,258,24

The spike (S) glycoprotein of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is a major immunogenic and protective protein and plays a crucial role in viral pathogenesis. In this study, we successfully constructed a synthetic codon-optimized DNA-based vaccine as a countermeasure against SARS-CoV-2, denoted VIU-1005. The design was based on a codon-optimized coding sequence of a consensus full-length S glycoprotein. The immunogenicity of the vaccine was tested in two mouse models (BALB/c and C57BL/6J). Th1-skewed systemic S-specific IgG antibodies and neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) were significantly induced in both models 4 weeks after three injections with 100 μg of the VIU-1005 vaccine via intramuscular needle injection but not intradermal or subcutaneous routes. Such immunization induced long-lasting IgG and memory T cell responses in mice that lasted for at least 6 months. Interestingly, using a needle-free system, we showed an enhanced immunogenicity of VIU-1005 in which lower or fewer doses were able to elicit significantly high levels of Th1-biased systemic S-specific immune responses, as demonstrated by the significant levels of binding IgG antibodies, nAbs and IFN-γ, TNF and IL-2 cytokine production from memory CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cells in BALB/c mice. Furthermore, compared to intradermal needle injection, which failed to induce any significant immune response, intradermal needle-free immunization elicited a robust Th1-biased humoral response similar to that observed with intramuscular immunization. Together, our results demonstrate that the synthetic VIU-1005 candidate DNA vaccine is highly immunogenic and capable of inducing long-lasting Th1-skewed humoral and cellular immunity in mice. Furthermore, we show that the use of a needle-free system could enhance the immunogenicity and minimize doses needed to induce protective immunity in mice, supporting further preclinical and clinical testing of this candidate vaccine.","Alamri, Sawsan S.; Alluhaybi, Khalid A.; Alhabbab, Rowa Y.; Basabrain, Mohammad; Algaissi, Abdullah; Almahboub, Sarah; Alfaleh, Mohamed A.; Abujamel, Turki S.; Abdulaal, Wesam H.; ElAssouli, M-Zaki; Alharbi, Rahaf H.; Hassanain, Mazen; Hashem, Anwar M.",Front Microbiol,258,8

Their role became more critical during the COVID‐19 pandemic. This study aims to investigate the community pharmacists' preparedness and responses to the COVID‐19 pandemic and how efficiently they were prepared to contain and prevent the spread of infection. METHODS: An online questionnaire was distributed to community pharmacists in Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, and Jordan through social media platforms. A scoring system was developed to measure their level of adherence to the preventive measures of the global infection. RESULTS: The total included responses were 800. Around 44% of the pharmacists reported spending less than 15 min/d reading about COVID‐19 updates. Although more than half of them were reviewing official sites, 73% of them were also retrieving information through non‐official channels. Additionally, almost 35% of them were directly contacting customers without physical barriers, 81% reported encountering infected customers, and 12% wore the same facial masks for more than a day. Moreover, 58% of the pharmacies reported the absence of door signs requesting infected customers to declare the infection, 43% of the pharmacies were not limiting the number of simultaneous customers, and 70% were not measuring customers' temperatures prior to entry. Collectively, the mean total score of applied protective measures was 10.12 ± 2.77 (out of 17). CONCLUSION: The level of preparedness of the community pharmacies in these three Middle Eastern countries was not adequate for facing the COVID‐19 pandemic.

Healthcare workers, including mental health providers, may experience increased emotional and behavioral health concerns to a greater degree than the general public. The objective of the present study was to examine the frequency and the perceived effectiveness of various coping strategies implemented by mental health practitioners during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as differences across career stages (i.e., trainees versus licensed practitioners [LPs]). Survey data were collected from mental health practitioners (N = 888) assessing the strategies they used to manage COVID-19-associated anxiety/distress and the perceived effectiveness of these strategies. Bonferroni-adjusted chi-square tests and t-tests were conducted to assess differences by career stage. Overall, respondents used various coping strategies, most commonly behavioral strategies such as distraction/engaging in an enjoyable activity (88.63%), spending time with loved ones (77.82%), and exercise (72.64%). Over one-quarter reported using alcohol to cope (28.27%). Respondents generally perceived their coping strategies as somewhat to very effective; no strategies were generally perceived as ineffective. Compared to LPs, trainees were significantly more likely to manage COVID-19-related anxiety/distress using supervision (p < .001) and substances other than alcohol or tobacco (p < .001). There were no significant differences in how effective trainees and LPs perceived each strategy. U.S. mental health practitioners’ use of predominantly behavioral coping strategies, which were generally perceived as effective, during the first months of COVID-19 offers implications for interventions as the pandemic progresses.","Reilly, Shannon E.; Soulliard, Zachary A.; McCuddy, William T.; Mahoney, James J.",Curr Psychol,258,1

In England, as in some other countries, preventive policies have been implemented to protect this population. We aimed to estimate the avoided deaths and health-care use among people experiencing homelessness during the so-called first wave of COVID-19 in England—ie, the peak of infections occurring between February and May, 2020—and the potential impact of COVID-19 on this population in the future. METHODS: We used a discrete-time Markov chain model of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection that included compartments for susceptible, exposed, infectious, and removed individuals, to explore the impact of the pandemic on 46 565 individuals experiencing homelessness: 35 817 living in 1065 hostels for homeless people, 3616 sleeping in 143 night shelters, and 7132 sleeping outside. We ran the model under scenarios varying the incidence of infection in the general population and the availability of prevention measures: specialist hotel accommodation, infection control in homeless settings, and mixing with the general population. We divided our scenarios into first wave scenarios (covering Feb 1–May 31, 2020) and future scenarios (covering June 1, 2020–Jan 31, 2021). For each scenario, we ran the model 200 times and reported the median and 95% prediction interval (2·5% and 97·5% quantiles) of the total number of cases, the number of deaths, the number hospital admissions, and the number of intensive care unit (ICU) admissions. FINDINGS: Up to May 31, 2020, we calibrated the model to 4% of the homeless population acquiring SARS-CoV-2, and estimated that 24 deaths (95% prediction interval 16–34) occurred. In this first wave of SARS-CoV-2 infections in England, we estimated that the preventive measures imposed might have avoided 21 092 infections (19 777–22 147), 266 deaths (226–301), 1164 hospital admissions (1079–1254), and 338 ICU admissions (305–374) among the homeless population. If preventive measures are continued, we projected a small number of additional cases between June 1, 2020, and Jan 31, 2021, with 1754 infections (1543–1960), 31 deaths (21–45), 122 hospital admissions (100–148), and 35 ICU admissions (23–47) with a second wave in the general population. However, if preventive measures are lifted, outbreaks in homeless settings might lead to larger numbers of infections and deaths, even with low incidence in the general population. In a scenario with no second wave and relaxed measures in homeless settings in England, we projected 12 151 infections (10 718–13 349), 184 deaths (151–217), 733 hospital admissions (635–822), and 213 ICU admissions (178–251) between June 1, 2020, and Jan 31, 2021. INTERPRETATION: Outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 in homeless settings can lead to a high attack rate among people experiencing homelessness, even if incidence remains low in the general population. Avoidance of deaths depends on prevention of transmission within settings such as hostels and night shelters.

A common mechanism of host recognition by viruses is to utilize a portion of the host cell as a receptor. Bacteriophage Sf6, which infects Shigella flexneri, uses lipopolysaccharide as a primary receptor and then requires interaction with a secondary receptor, a role that can be fulfilled by either outer membrane proteins (Omp) A or C. Our previous work showed that specific residues in the loops of OmpA mediate Sf6 infection. To better understand Sf6 interactions with OmpA loop variants, we determined the kinetics of these interactions through the use of biolayer interferometry, an optical biosensing technique that yields data similar to surface plasmon resonance. Here, we successfully tethered whole Sf6 virions, determined the binding constant of Sf6 to OmpA to be 36 nM. Additionally, we showed that Sf6 bound to five variant OmpAs and the resulting kinetic parameters varied only slightly. Based on these data, we propose a model in which Sf6: Omp receptor recognition is not solely based on kinetics, but likely also on the ability of an Omp to induce a conformational change that results in productive infection.","Hubbs, Natalia B.; Whisby-Pitts, Mareena M.; McMurry, Jonathan L.",bioRxiv,258,10

On 22nd March 2020, following identification of a confirmed COVID-19 case in a prisoner in Prison A (UK), an Outbreak Control Team was convened consisting of prison staff and public health experts from Public Health England and the UK National Health Service. Methods: At the start of the outbreak, four prisoners and 40 staff were isolating with COVID-19 symptoms. An outbreak was declared and full prison lockdown implemented. Prompt implementation of novel outbreak control measures prevented an explosive prison outbreak, specifically establishment of dedicated isolation and cohorting units, including (i) Reverse Cohorting Units (RCUs) for accommodating new detainees; (ii) Protective Isolation Units (PIUs) for isolating symptomatic prisoners (new detainees and existing residents), and (iii) Shielding Units (SUs) to protect medically vulnerable prisoners. Findings: In total, 120 probable and 25 confirmed cases among prisoners and staff were recorded between March and June 2020. Among prisoners, there were six possible, 79 probable, and three confirmed cases. Among staff, there were 83 possible, 79 probable, and 22 confirmed cases. Testing of symptomatic prisoners was limited for most of the outbreak, with only 33% of probable cases tested. This explains the low number of confirmed cases (three) among prisoners despite the large number of probable cases (n=81; 92%). Over 50% of the initial cases among prisoners were on the two wings associated with the index case. Interpretation: Rapid transmission of SARS-COV-2 was prevented through proactive steps in identifying and isolating infected prisoners (and staff), cohorting new admissions and shielding vulnerable individuals. These novel and cost-effective approaches can be implemented in a wide range of correctional facilities globally and proved effective even in the absence of mass testing.","Coleman, P.; Gajraj, R.; Chandan, J.

Numerous countries have attempted to employ precautions to address this pandemic. Objective This study was aimed at exploring and assessing the precautionary actions taken by 175 countries on six continents to prevent the spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Methods An observational study was conducted based on data collected during the period from December 31, 2020, until the end of April 2020. Several data were extracted, including information related to the date of the first reported case of SARS-CoV-2, total confirmed cases, total active cases, and more. In addition, seven validated indicators were used to assess the countries preparedness and precautionary actions. Results A total of 175 countries were included in the study. The total COVID-19 infection rate increased exponentially and rapidly in North America and Europe from March to April. The application of the precautions (indicators) varied between countries. School closures, quarantines and curfews were the most applied indicators among all countries. As for the relationship between the indicators and their effects on the infection rate, Italy and Spain were the top countries in Europe and adopted all indicators. Nevertheless, they faced high infection rates: 239,639 and 205,463 COVID-19 cases in Spain, and Italy, respectively. Conclusion The precautionary actions might have played a role in limiting the spread of COVID-19 in several countries. However, many countries did not benefit from applying these indicators.","Alshammari, T. M.; Alenzi, K.; Alnofal, F.; Fradees, G.; Altebainawi, A.",,258,10

Recently, we have identified a distinct category of mutation, caused by premature stop codons and frameshift mutations, which manifests in diminished expression of COOH-terminally truncated CFTR at the cell surface. Although the biosynthetic processing and plasma membrane targeting of truncated CFTRs are preserved, the turnover of the complex-glycosylated mutant is sixfold faster than its wild-type (wt) counterpart. Destabilization of the truncated CFTR coincides with its enhanced susceptibility to proteasome-dependent degradation from post-Golgi compartments globally, and the plasma membrane specifically, determined by pulse–chase analysis in conjunction with cell surface biotinylation. Proteolytic cleavage of the full-length complex-glycosylated wt and degradation intermediates derived from both T70 and wt CFTR requires endolysosomal proteases. The enhanced protease sensitivity in vitro and the decreased thermostability of the complex-glycosylated T70 CFTR in vivo suggest that structural destabilization may account for the increased proteasome susceptibility and the short residence time at the cell surface. These in turn are responsible, at least in part, for the phenotypic manifestation of CF. We propose that the proteasome-ubiquitin pathway may be involved in the peripheral quality control of other, partially unfolded membrane proteins as well.","Benharouga, Mohamed; Haardt, Martin; Kartner, Norbert; Lukacs, Gergely L.",J Cell Biol,258,16

METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of all patients seen at three radiation oncology departments within the “XXXX” Health system in “XXXX” during the initial COVID-19 surge. Primary end points were to define and quantify COVID-related, radiation-specific care changes, and to identify predictive factors of experiencing COVID-related care changes. RESULTS: 545 cancer patients were seen during the study period, 99 of whom (18.1%) experienced >1 COVID-related care change. Radiation treatment (RT) delays were most common, accounting for 51.5% of all care changes. Physician-directed delays accounted for 41.2% of RT delays, while patient fears, COVID testing, and access barriers were responsible for 27.5%, 17.6%, and 13.7%, respectively. Patient age (p=0.040), intent of treatment (p=0.047), and cancer type (p<0.001) were significantly associated with experiencing a COVID-related care change, as we found that older, curative intent, and rectal cancer patients were more likely to experience care changes. On multivariate analysis, patient age remained significant when controlling for treatment intent and cancer type. CONCLUSION: Our study provides a perspective on how care was adapted to protect cancer patients during a pandemic while maximizing disease control. The positive correlation between age and likelihood of care changes may reflect extra precaution taken with older patients given their vulnerability to severe COVID illness; while the lower observed likelihood of COVID-related care changes among patients undergoing palliative RT may reflect either the more urgent needs addressed by palliative RT or may simply be logistical, as palliative radiation is often delivered in short courses with less exposure risk. It will be crucial to assess adaptations others have implemented and monitor how they impact patient outcomes.","Pendyala, Praveen; Goglia, Alexander G.; Mattes, Malcolm D.; Grann, Alison; Huang, David; Wagman, Raquel T.; Yehia, Zeinab Abou; Yoon, Jennifer; Ennis, Ronald D.",Adv Radiat Oncol,258,28

Severe or fatal illnesses are attributed to SARS-CoV-2, generally without attempting to evaluate for alternative causes or co-pathogens. CASE PRESENTATION: A five-year-old girl with fever and headache was diagnosed with acute SARS-CoV-2-associated meningoencephalitis based on the detection of its RNA on a nasopharyngeal swab, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, and magnetic resonance imaging findings. Serial serologic tests for SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA showed seroconversion, consistent with an acute infection. Mental status and brain imaging findings gradually worsened despite antiviral therapy and intravenous dexamethasone. Decompressive suboccipital craniectomy for brain herniation with cerebellar biopsy on day 30 of illness, shortly before death, revealed SARS-CoV-2 RNA in cerebellar tissue using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2019-nCoV Real-Time Reverse Transcriptase-PCR Diagnostic Panel. On histopathology, necrotizing granulomas with numerous acid-fast bacilli were visualized, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex DNA was detected by PCR. Ventricular cerebrospinal fluid that day was negative for mycobacterial DNA. Tracheal aspirate samples for mycobacterial DNA and culture from days 22 and 27 of illness were negative by PCR but grew Mycobacterium tuberculosis after 8 weeks, long after the child’s passing. She had no known exposures to tuberculosis and no chest radiographic findings to suggest it. All 6 family members had normal chest radiographs and negative interferon-γ release assay results. The source of her tuberculous infection was not identified, and further investigations by the local health department were not possible because of the State of Michigan-mandated lockdown for control of SARS-CoV-2 spread. CONCLUSION: The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in cerebellar tissue and the demonstration of seroconversion in IgG and IgA assays was consistent with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection of the central nervous infection. However, the cause of death was brain herniation from her rapidly progressive central nervous system tuberculosis. SARS-CoV-2 may mask or worsen occult tuberculous infection with severe or fatal consequences.","Freij, Bishara J.; Gebara, Bassam M.; Tariq, Rabail; Wang, Ay-Ming; Gibson, John; El-Wiher, Nidal; Krasan, Graham; Patek, Paul M.; Levasseur, Kelly A.; Amin, Mitual; Fullmer, Joseph M.",BMC Pediatr,258,1

METHODS: Semi-structured interviews with patients, GPs and oncologists explored experiences of prostate cancer follow-up. Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. The three participant groups were analysed as individual datasets but the same key themes were evident across the groups. RESULTS: 14 patients, 6 GPs and 5 oncologists were interviewed. Four main themes were identified: Experience of current practice; Knowledge and understanding of prostate cancer follow up; Disparity of processes and pathways; Unclear roles and responsibilities. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this study highlight the variation in the approach to prostate specific antigen monitoring and emphasise the lack of clear policies and practices. The lack of clarity around existing follow up and monitoring processes could cause delays in the diagnosis of recurrence. There is a need for a new and improved pathway for prostate cancer follow up. The pathway should include clear and concise guidance for patients, primary care and secondary care and all relevant parties need to understand what their role is within the pathway.","Taylor, Sally; Johnson, Helen; Peat, Sara; Booker, Jane; Yorke, Janelle",Eur J Oncol Nurs,258,3

Participants in the treatment condition underwent a 7-week group based CBP, which addressed various HIV-related issues. Relevant cognitive and behavioral strategies were taught as well. The aim of treatment was to improve the quality of life and to reduce psychological distress in a sample of heterosexual symptomatic HIV-infected men. Prior to intervention, baseline measures showed that our sample had a lower quality of life in comparison with the local general population. They also experienced a significant level of psychological distress. Following intervention, men in the CBP group demonstrated significant improvement in the mental health dimension of quality of life and a significant reduction in depressed mood. These preliminary findings suggested that short-term cognitive-behavioral therapy can be effective in improving the quality of life and mood of Chinese heterosexual HIV-infected men.","Chan, Iris; Kong, Paul; Leung, Patrick; Au, Alma; Li, Patrick; Chung, Rita; Man Po, Lee; Yu, Pansy",Patient Educ Couns,258,20

Distinct clinical features in these patients have led to speculation that the immune response to virus in the SARS-CoV-2-infected alveolus differs from other types of pneumonia(2). We collected bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples from 88 patients with SARS-CoV-2-induced respiratory failure and 211 patients with known or suspected pneumonia from other pathogens and subjected them to flow cytometry and bulk transcriptomic profiling. We performed single-cell RNA-seq on 10 bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples collected from patients with severe COVID-19 within 48 hours of intubation. In the majority of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, the alveolar space was persistently enriched in T cells and monocytes. Bulk and single-cell transcriptomic profiling suggested that SARS-CoV-2 infects alveolar macrophages, which in turn respond by producing T cell chemoattractants. These T cells produce interferon-gamma to induce inflammatory cytokine release from alveolar macrophages and further promote T cell activation. Collectively, our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 causes a slowly-unfolding, spatially limited alveolitis in which alveolar macrophages harboring SARS-CoV-2 and T cells form a positive feedback loop that drives persistent alveolar inflammation.","Grant, Rogan A.; Morales-Nebreda, Luisa; Markov, Nikolay S.; Swaminathan, Suchitra; Querrey, Melissa; Guzman, Estefany R.; Abbott, Darryl A.; Donnelly, Helen K.; Donayre, Alvaro; Goldberg, Isaac A.; Klug, Zasu M.; Borkowski, Nicole; Lu, Ziyan; Kihshen, Hermon; Politanska, Yuliya; Sichizya, Lango; Kang, Mengjia; Shilatifard, Ali; Qi, Chao; Lomasney, Jon W.; Argento, A.

In this context, psychologists are mostly providers of this kind of service more than users. This study aimed at investigating and comparing post-hoc the subjective experience of psychotherapists, psychology trainees & students, and individuals of the general population who participated in a psychodynamically-oriented supportive group intervention. Fifty-two subjects were enrolled to participate to focus groups aimed at exploring participants’ decision to participate, their perceptions on how the support group influenced their elaboration of the psychological effects of pandemic/lockdown, and their feedback on its utility. Transcripts of the focus groups were analyzed with the Linguistic Inquiry Word Count (LIWC). Differences in the use of words/linguistic categories between groups were tested through chi-square tests. Content analysis was conducted by independent judges who extracted the most relevant comments. Preliminary results showed the main features related to the crisis response, and how belonging to different social roles was associated with different ways of experiencing and sharing emotions. People react in different ways to traumatic events, and how people react may say a lot about how they cope with the event and the extent to which the event plays a role in the future. Clinical implications on the use of this data for future treatment planning are also discussed.","Brusadelli, Emanuela; Ferrari, Laura; Benetti, Michele; Bruzzese, Stefania; Tonelli, Giada Maria; Gullo, Salvatore",Res Psychother,258,1

We hypothesized that men have a higher mortality than women at any given age but that sex differences will decrease with age as only the healthiest men survive to older ages. METHODS: We used population data from the Institut National D’Études Démographiques on cumulative deaths due to COVID-19 from February to June 2020 in 10 European regions: Denmark, Norway, Sweden, The Netherlands, England and Wales, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Portugal. For each region, we calculated cumulative mortality rates stratified by age and sex and corresponding relative risks for men vs. women. RESULTS: The relative risk of dying from COVID-19 was higher for men than for women in almost all age groups in all regions. The overall relative risk ranged from 1.11 (95% confidence interval, CI 1.01–1.23) in Portugal to 1.54 (95% CI 1.49–1.58) in France. In most regions, sex differences increased until the ages of 60–69 years, but decreased thereafter with the smallest sex difference at age 80+ years. CONCLUSION: Despite variability in data collection and time coverage among regions, the study showed an overall similar pattern of sex differences in COVID-19 mortality in Europe.

The emergence of more transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants in the United Kingdom (B.1.1.7), South Africa (B1.351) and Brazil (P.1) requires a vigorous public health response, including real time strain surveillance on a global scale. Although new SARS-CoV-2 variants can be most accurately identified by genomic sequencing, this approach is time consuming and expensive. A simple and more rapid screen for the key SARS-CoV-2 mutations that define variant strains is needed. We developed a simple, rapid and high-throughput reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) melting temperature assay that identifies the SARS-CoV-2 N501Y mutation, a key mutation which is present in all three known variant strains of concern. METHODS. RT-PCR primers and two sloppy molecular beacon (SMB) probes were designed to amplify and detect the SARS-CoV-2 N501Y (A23063T) mutation. One SMB was designed with a probe region that was complementary to the wild type sequence (WT) and a second SMB was designed with a probe region that was complementary to the mutant (MT) sequence. Each SMB was labeled with a different fluorophore, and the assay was performed in a single test well. After RT-PCR, WT versus MT SARS-CoV-2 was identified by a characteristic shift in the melting temperature (Tm) of each SMB. Assay optimization and testing was performed with RNA from SARS-CoV-2 USA WA1/2020 (WT) and SARS-CoV-2 hCoV-19/England/204820464/2020 (a B.1.17 variant). The assay was then validated using clinical samples. RESULTS. The limit of detection (LOD) of the assay for both the WT and the B1.1.7 variant was 4 genomic copies/reaction. The two SMBs produced Tm shifts that were 100% sensitive and 100% specific for identifying the N501Y mutation in cultured virus and in clinical samples as confirmed by Sanger sequencing. CONCLUSION. We have developed a rapid screening test for the SARS-CoV-2 N501Y mutation, which is a characteristic of all three SARS-CoV-2 stains of global concern. This assay can be used to rapidly screen large numbers of patient samples for these variants, providing an early warning for the emergence and spread of these strains of concern.","Banada, Padmapriya; Green, Raquel; Banik, Sukalyani; Chopoorian, Abby; Streck, Deanna; Jones, Robert; Chakravorty, Soumitesh; Alland, David",medRxiv,258,16

Herein, we developed EGYVIR as a potent immunomodulatory herbal extract with promising antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. It constitutes of a combination of black pepper extract with curcumin extract. The antiviral effect of EGYVIR extract is attributed to the two key phases of the disease in severe cases. First, the inhibition of the nuclear translocation of NF-kβ p50, attenuating the SARS-CoV-2 infection-associated cytokine storm. Additionally, the EGYVIR extract has an in vitro virucidal effect for SARS-CoV-2. The in vitro study of EGYVIR extract against SARS-CoV-2 on Huh-7 cell lines, revealed the potential role of NF-kβ/TNFα/IL-6 during the infection process. EGYVIR antagonizes the NF-kβ pathway in-silico and in-vitro studies. Consequently, it has the potential to hinder the release of IL-6 and TNFα, decreasing the production of essential cytokines storm elements.","Roshdy, Wael H.; Rashed, Helmy A.; Kandeil, Ahmed; Mostafa, Ahmed; Moatasim, Yassmin; Kutkat, Omnia; Abo Shama, Noura M.; Gomaa, Mokhtar R.; El-Sayed, Ibrahim H.; El Guindy, Nancy M.; Naguib, Amal; Kayali, Ghazi; Ali, Mohamed A.",PLoS One,258,14

We propose solutions based on differential replication, a technique where the knowledge acquired by the deployed models is reused in specific ways to train more suitable future generations. We discuss different mechanisms to implement differential replications in practice, depending on the considered level of knowledge.

Methods Urologic trainees and attending physicians at our institution, who are familiar with existing safety recommendations and guidelines regarding the care of infected patients, were queried regarding their experiences to determine an expert consensus on best practices for bedside procedures for SARS-CoV-2 positive patients. Results Our team developed the following general recommendations for urologic interventions on SARS-CoV-2 positive patients: maximize use of telehealth (even for inpatient consults), minimize in-room time, use personal protective equipment appropriately, enlist a colleague to assist, and acquire all supplies that may be needed and maintain them outside the room. Detailed recommendations were also developed for difficult urethral catheterization, bedside cystoscopy, incision and drainage of abscesses, and gross hematuria/clot irrigations. Conclusions As patients hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 infection are predominantly men over 50 years old, there are significant urologic challenges common in this population that have emerged with this pandemic. While there is tremendous variation in how different regions have been affected, the demographics of SARS-CoV-2 mean that urologists will continue to have a unique role in helping to manage these patients. Here, we summarize recommendations for bedside urologic interventions specific to SARS-CoV-2 positive patients based on experiences from a large metropolitan hospital system. Regulations and requirements may differ on an institutional basis, so these guidelines are intended to augment specific local protocols.","Souders, Colby P.; Zhao, Hanson; Ackerman, A.
