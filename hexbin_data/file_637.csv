12717,Normalization cancer immunotherapy: blocking Siglec-15!,2019-04-19,"INTRODUCTION: Acute spinal cord injury is associated with an increased risk of thromboembolic events. Low-molecular-weight heparins are first-line medications for both the treatment and prevention of venous thromboembolism. Pharmacological prophylaxis may be indicated for high-risk patients and low-risk patients may be managed with non-pharmacological measures. CASE PRESENTATION: We report two cases of gluteal hematomas that occurred in patients with chronic spinal cord injury who were under prophylactic doses of enoxaparin at a tertiary rehabilitation hospital. There was no local trauma. The patients needed multiple surgical interventions and rehabilitation treatment was delayed. DISCUSSION: There is a lack of evidence to correctly estimate the thromboembolic risk in chronic spinal cord injury and the duration of prophylaxis. Over-prescription of pharmacological prophylaxis may expose patients to unnecessary risks. These patients frequently present with polypharmacy and reducing the amount of prescribed medication may begin with reducing prophylactic treatments for venous thromboembolism, which may be an overtreatment based on risk overestimation.","de Almeida, Rodrigo Lanna; Gonzaga, Bruno Pissolati Mattos; Beraldo, Paulo Sérgio Siebra; Amado, Veronica Moreira",Spinal Cord Ser Cases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6474234/,637

12764,"The proatherosclerotic function of indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase 1 in the developmental stage of atherosclerosis",2019-07-19,"BACKGROUND: Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO(2))—oxygen at pressures higher than atmospheric—is approved for 14 indications by the Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society. HBO(2)’s main effect is to increase oxygen content in plasma and body tissues, which can counteract hypoxia or ischemia. Laboratory studies show that HBO(2) has effects beyond relieving hypoxia (eg, promoting angiogenesis in irradiated tissue, anti-inflammatory effects, radiosensitization of tumors, hypoxia preconditioning, and fungal growth inhibition) and has potential to treat conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease and pyoderma gangrenosum. Lack of consistently collected outcome data on a large cohort of individuals receiving HBO(2) therapy limits its use for both established and new indications. A course of therapy often involves 30-40 visits to a hyperbaric chamber, so the number of patients seen at any given center is constrained by chamber capacity. As a result, published HBO(2) outcome data tend to be from small case series because few patients with a particular condition are treated at a given center. To solve this problem, a registry that collects and pools data systematically from multiple institutions has been established. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to collect consistent outcome data across multiple hyperbaric centers to assess treatment effectiveness and establish a research consortium. METHODS: A consortium of hyperbaric centers who have agreed to collect consistent outcome data on all patients seen has been assembled. Data are collected at each participating center using Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap), a web-based, data collection system used frequently for research. Standard outcome measures have been defined for each condition, which are programmed into the REDCap data collection templates. Governance is through a consortium agreement that defines data security, data sharing, publications, liability, and other issues. Centers obtain Institutional Review Board (IRB) and ethics approval to participate, either from their own institutions or by relying on the IRB at the coordinating center at Dartmouth College. Dissemination will occur through a yearly report and by publications based on the data in the registry. RESULTS: Early results from some common indications show significant pretreatment to posttreatment changes. Additional indications and outcome measures are being added using the procedures outlined in the consortium agreement. CONCLUSIONS: The registry collects consistent outcome information for a therapy that needs further study and a stronger evidence base. It also overcomes the challenge of collecting data from an adequate number of patients for both established and emerging indications by combining data collection from multiple centers. The data entry requirements should be within the capabilities of existing staff at any given hyperbaric center. By using REDCap, the registry can be expanded to include detailed information on particular indications and long-term follow-up on selected patients without significantly increasing the basic data entry requirements. Through the registry, a network of enrolled hyperbaric centers has been established that provides the basis for a clinical trial network.

13111,The effect of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors on cognitive function in patients with Alzheimer’s disease and vascular dementia: focusing on fluoxetine with long follow-up periods,2019-08-30,"Metastasis is a major cause of chemotherapeutic failure and death. Degradation of a specific component of the extracellular matrix (ECM) by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) affects the physical barrier of the tumor microenvironment (TME) and induces metastasis. Here, lysolipid-containing thermosensitive liposomes (LTSLs) were prepared to deliver an MMP inhibitor, marimastat (MATT), to the TME to inhibit MMP activity and expression. LTSLs rapidly released their payloads at 42 °C. Compared with the saline control, MATT-LTSLs exhibited enhanced accumulation in the tumor and a 20-fold decrease in tumor growth in 4T1 tumor-bearing mice; moreover, MATT-LTSLs reduced MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity by 50% and 43%, respectively, and downregulated MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression in vivo by 30% and 43%, respectively. Most importantly, MATT-LTSL treatment caused a 7-fold decrease in metastatic lung nodules and a 6-fold reduction in microvessels inside the tumor. We believe this study provides an effective approach for the suppression of metastasis, and the use of a cytotoxic agent in combination with MATT is a potential strategy for metastatic cancer treatment.","Lyu, Yaqi; Xiao, Qingqing; Yin, Lifang; Yang, Lei; He, Wei",Signal Transduct Target Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6799847/,637
13115,Potent delivery of an MMP inhibitor to the tumor microenvironment with thermosensitive liposomes for the suppression of metastasis and angiogenesis,2019-08-09,"OBJECTIVES: To examine and adapt a conceptual framework of the working alliance (WA) in the context of a low-intensity blended (psychological well-being practitioner (PWP) plus computerised program) cognitive behavioural therapy intervention (b-CBT) for depression. DESIGN: Patient involvement was enlisted to collaboratively shape the design of the project from the onset, before data collection. In-depth semi-structured interviews were carried out with participants who experienced b-CBT as part of the E-compared trial. A thematic analysis was conducted using a constant comparative method informed by grounded theory. SETTING: Recruitment was carried out in four psychological primary care services across the UK. PARTICIPANTS: Nineteen trial participants with major depressive disorder who completed at least one computerised program and face-to-face session with a PWP in the b-CBT arm were recruited to the study. RESULTS: Qualitative interviews that were guided by WA theory and patient involvement, revealed four themes: (1) a healthcare provider (PWP and computerised program) with good interpersonal competencies for building a working relationship with the client (‘bond’); (2) collaborative efforts between the client and the provider to appropriately identify what the client hopes to achieve through therapy (‘goals’); (3) the selection of acceptable therapeutic activities that address client goals and the availability of responsive support (‘task’) and (4) the promotion of active engagement and autonomous problem solving (‘usability heuristics’). Participants described how the PWP and computerised program uniquely and collectively contributed to different WA needs. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to offer a preliminary conceptual framework of WA in b-CBT for depression, and how such demands can be addressed through blended PWP-computerised program delivery. These findings can be used to promote WA in technological design and clinical practice, thereby promoting engagement to b-CBT interventions and effective deployment of practitioner and program resources.

18042,The STING1 network regulates autophagy and cell death,2021-06-02,"BACKGROUND: Plasmodium vivax is the most prevalent malaria parasite in many countries. A better understanding of human immunity to this parasite can provide new insights for vaccine development. Plasmodium vivax Reticulocyte Binding Proteins (RBPs) are key parasite proteins that interact with human proteins during erythrocyte invasion and are targets of the human immune response. The aim of this study is to characterize the human antibody response to RBP2P1, the most recently described member of the RBP family. METHODS: The levels of total IgG and IgM against RBP2P1 were measured using plasmas from 68 P. vivax malaria patients and 525 villagers in a malarious village of western Thailand. The latter group comprises asymptomatic carriers and healthy uninfected individuals. Subsets of plasma samples were evaluated for anti-RBP2P1 IgG subtypes and complement-fixing activity. RESULTS: As age increased, it was found that the level of anti-RBP2P1 IgG increased while the level of IgM decreased. The main anti-RBP2P1 IgG subtypes were IgG1 and IgG3. The IgG3-seropositive rate was higher in asymptomatic carriers than in patients. The higher level of IgG3 was correlated with higher in vitro RBP2P1-mediated complement fixing activity. CONCLUSIONS: In natural infection, the primary IgG response to RBP2P1 was IgG1 and IgG3. The predominance of these cytophilic subtypes and the elevated level of IgG3 correlating with complement fixing activity, suggest a possible role of anti-RBP2P1 antibodies in immunity against P. vivax.","Hietanen, Jenni; Chim-ong, Anongruk; Sattabongkot, Jetsumon; Nguitragool, Wang",Malar J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8173506/,637
207791,DHODH tangoing with GPX4 on the ferroptotic stage,2021,"OBJECTIVES: To describe long-term care services and supports (LTSS) in the United States, note their limitations in serving older adults post-incarceration, and offer potential solutions, with special consideration for the Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic. DESIGN: Narrative review. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: LTSS for older adults post-incarceration. METHODS: Literature review and policy analysis. RESULTS: Skilled nursing facilities, nursing homes, assisted living, adult foster homes, and informal care from family and friends compose LTSS for older adults, but their utilization suffers from access and payment complexities, especially for older adults post-incarceration. A combination of public-private partnerships, utilization of health professional trainees, and unique approaches to informal caregiver support, including direct compensation to caregivers, could help older adults reentering our communities following prison. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Long-standing gaps in US LTSS are revealed by the coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) pandemic. Older adults entering our communities from prison are particularly vulnerable and need unique solutions to aging care as they face stigma and access challenges not typically encountered by the general population. Our review and discussion offer guidance to systems, practitioners, and policy makers on how to improve the care of older adults after incarceration.","Boucher, Nathan A; Van Houtven, Courtney H; Dawson, Walter D",J.

Case reports and case series depicting the clinical effects of the causative virus-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-have been published, yet few demonstrate the cytopathologic alterations of this disease. We present a clinical-pathologic correlation report of a previously healthy Hispanic woman with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who had typical features of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and also showed cardiac abnormalities thought to represent fulminant viral myocarditis. Congruent with the ARDS clinical impression, autopsy findings were remarkable for extensive and markedly severe acute lung injury consistent with viral pneumonia, characterized by diffuse alveolar damage, pulmonary infarction, severe pulmonary edema, desquamation of pneumocytes with intra-alveolar aggregation, and pneumocyte morphologic alterations suggestive of viral cytopathic effect. However, there was incongruence between the clinical impression and the cardiovascular pathology findings in that viral myocarditis was not detected on histopathologic evaluation. This case highlights the importance of pathologic corroboration of the clinical impression and, in addition, illuminates the key role autopsy plays during a pandemic by providing valuable insight into viral pathology in tissues.","Yan, Lei; Mir, Mahnoor; Sanchez, Paloma; Beg, Moeezullah; Peters, Jay; Enriquez, Omar; Gilbert, Andrea",Arch Pathol Lab Med,,637

DESIGN: A retrospective observational study based on electronic health record data. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals &#8805;14 years old with a positive PCR or serology test, between 28 February and 31 May 2020, belonging to the Basque Country (Spain) public health system. Institutionalised and individuals admitted to a hospital at home unit were excluded from the study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Three severity categories were established: primary care, hospital/intensive care unit admission and death. RESULTS: A total of n=14 197 cases fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Most variables presented statistically significant associations with the outcome (p<0.0001). The Classification and Regression Trees recursive partitioning methodology (based on n=13 792) suggested that among all associations, those with, age, sex, stratification of patient healthcare complexity, chronic consumption of blood and blood-forming organ, and nervous system drugs, as well as the total number of chronic Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical types were the most relevant. Psychosis also emerged as a potential factor. CONCLUSIONS: Older cases are more likely to experience more severe outcomes. However, the sex, underlying health status and chronic drug consumption may interfere and alter the ageing effect. Understanding the factors related to the outcome severity is of key importance when designing and promoting public health intervention plans for the COVID-19 pandemic.","Vrotsou, Kalliopi; Rotaeche, Rafael; Mateo-Abad, Maider; Machón, Mónica; Vergara, Itziar",BMJ Open,,637

These manuscripts are not the final version of record and will be replaced with the final article (formatted per AJHP style and proofed by the authors) at a later time. PURPOSE: To assess pharmacy technician learning preferences using the VARK tool and through self-identification. METHODS: The VARK (visual, aural, read/write, kinesthetic) questionnaire was incorporated into a larger survey, which was distributed during live staff meetings and a continuing education session held by the state Pharmacists Association attended by 204 pharmacy technicians across various practice settings. RESULTS: A 90% response rate was achieved. Most respondents (78.8%) self-identified a single predominant learning preference, with 60.3% indicating a preference for kinesthetic learning methods. In contrast, after assessment with the VARK questionnaire 37.9% of survey participants were categorized as having a quadmodal learning style incorporating all VARK modalities. With regard to the Pharmacy Technician Certification Exam, a large majority of participants (96.2% of those providing a response) indicated that they had taken the exam in the past, with 17 participants (9.3% of those providing a response) indicating more than 1 attempt to pass the exam. Furthermore, experiential (on-the-job) training was identified by a large majority of survey respondents (79.3%) as the preferred way to learn new information. CONCLUSION: Learning preferences of pharmacy technicians vary amongst individuals, with many found to have multiple learning preferences through VARK questionnaire assessment. Incorporating experiential training and establishing learning preferences of pharmacy technicians may aid in development of accredited training programs that cater to the needs of pharmacy technicians.","Stanley, Erin R; Hafford, Amanda; Naseman, Ryan; Li, Junan; Worley, Marcia; Mehta, Bella H",Am. j. health system pharm,,637

METHODS: A retrospective analysis of medical charts of patients arrived at the ED of Gaslini Children's Hospital from 10th March 2020 to 30th April 2019 and the same frame of 2020 were performed. We compared two groups by demographics, duration of fever before ED admission, triage code, number of patients hospitalized after ED evaluation. We calculated proportion and incidence rate for airborne infections, fever, and urinary tract infections (UTI), appendicitis, and gastroenteritis for control. RESULTS: 1362 children arrived at the ED during the lockdown compared to 5628 in the same period of 2019 (-75,8%). No difference was noticed (27.7% vs 28.4%) in the total amount of infectious episodes. A significant reduction in rate of incidence and proportion were observed for upper respiratory tract infections (21,4% vs 28%), otitis (2,6% vs 16,2%), streptococcal infections (0,5% vs 5,2%) and bronchiolitis (2,1% vs 5,7%). Conversely, FUO (27,8 vs 11,1%), infectious mononucleosis (2,6% vs 0,4%), UTI (7,4% vs 2,9%) and appendicitis (6,8% vs 1,1%) significantly increased. Median time from the onset of fever and arrival in ED was significantly lower in 2020 group. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated a reduction in community-acquired respiratory infections during the lockdown for COVID-19. The increase in rate of FUO and febrile conditions, together with the short time from fever onset and ED visit could be related to the fear for a SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Rotulo, G.

MSCs have been widely used in clinical trials to treat multiple conditions associated with inflammation and tissue damage. Recent evidence suggests that most of the MSC therapeutic effects are derived from their secretome, including the extracellular vesicles, representing a promising approach in regenerative medicine application to treat organ failure as a result of inflammation/fibrosis. The recent outbreak of respiratory syndrome coronavirus, caused by the newly identified agent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has forced scientists worldwide to use all available instruments to fight the infection, including the inflammatory cascade caused by this pandemic disease. The use of MSCs is a valid approach to combat organ inflammation in different compartments. In addition to the lungs, which are considered the main inflammatory target for this virus, other organs are compromised by the infection. In particular, the liver is involved in the inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, which causes organ failure, leading to death in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. We herein summarize the current implications derived from the use of MSCs and their soluble derivatives in COVID-19 treatment, and emphasize the potential of MSC-based therapy in this clinical setting.","Chinnici, Cinzia Maria; Russelli, Giovanna; Bulati, Matteo; Miceli, Vitale; Gallo, Alessia; Busà, Rosalia; Tinnirello, Rosaria; Conaldi, Pier Giulio; Iannolo, Gioacchin",World J Gastroenterol,,637

310895,"Door to the cell for COVID-19 opened, leading way to therapies",2020,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a worldwide pandemic since it emerged in December 2019. Previous studies have reported rapid antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 in the first 2 to 3 weeks after symptom onset. Here, we retrospectively described the dynamic changes of serum immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG specifically against SARS-CoV-2 in later weeks (mainly 4-10 weeks) in 97 hospitalized patients with COVID-19. We observed that serum IgM and IgG, especially in patients with moderate-to-high levels, declined significantly between week 4 to 10 after illness onset. Notably, IgG levels in high percentage of patients (77.5%, 31 of 40) rapidly declined by half, from 212.5 (range, 163.7-420.3) to 96.3 (range, 75.0-133.4) AU/mL, within 1 to 2 weeks in the second month and then sustained at around 100 AU/mL until discharge from hospital.

Previous studies have reported rapid antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 in the first 2 to 3 weeks after symptom onset. Here, we retrospectively described the dynamic changes of serum immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG specifically against SARS-CoV-2 in later weeks (mainly 4-10 weeks) in 97 hospitalized patients with COVID-19. We observed that serum IgM and IgG, especially in patients with moderate-to-high levels, declined significantly between week 4 to 10 after illness onset. Notably, IgG levels in high percentage of patients (77.5%, 31 of 40) rapidly declined by half, from 212.5 (range, 163.7-420.3) to 96.3 (range, 75.0-133.4) AU/mL, within 1 to 2 weeks in the second month and then sustained at around 100 AU/mL until discharge from hospital. Significant reduction of IgM was also observed as SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid turned negative (P = .002). In the recovery stage, serum IgG declined significantly (early vs late recovery stage, n = 16, P = .003) with a median reduction of 50.0% (range, 3.7%-77.0%).

Following Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, states and healthcare institutions initially prioritised healthcare personnel and elderly residents of congregant facilities; other groups at elevated risk for severe complications are now becoming eligible through locally administered programmes. The question remains, however: who else should be prioritised for immunisation? Here, we call attention to individuals institutionalised with severe mental illnesses and/or developmental or intellectual disabilities-a group highly susceptible to the damages of COVID-19, recent research shows, and critical to consider for priority vaccination. The language describing both federal-level and state-level intentions for this population remains largely vague, despite the population's diversity across age, diagnosis, functional status and living arrangement. Such absence of specificity, in turn, leaves room for confusion and even neglect of various subgroups. We review data stressing this group's vulnerability, as well as select state plans for priority vaccination, highlighting the importance of clarity when describing intentions to vaccinate, or even generally care for, diverse populations composed of distinct subgroups in need.","Shevzov-Zebrun, Nina; Caplan, Arthur L",J. med. ethics,,637

334578,A core-shell structured COVID-19 mRNA vaccine with favorable biodistribution pattern and promising immunity,2021,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an inherited disorder caused by mutations in the gene encoding for the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein, an ATP-gated chloride channel expressed on the apical surface of airway epithelial cells. CFTR absence/dysfunction results in defective ion transport and subsequent airway surface liquid dehydration that severely compromise the airway microenvironment. Noxious agents and pathogens are entrapped inside the abnormally thick mucus layer and establish a highly inflammatory environment, ultimately leading to lung damage. Since chronic airway inflammation plays a crucial role in CF pathophysiology, several studies have investigated the mechanisms responsible for the altered inflammatory/immune response that, in turn, exacerbates the epithelial dysfunction and infection susceptibility in CF patients. In this review, we address the evidence for a critical role of dysfunctional inflammation in lung damage in CF and discuss current therapeutic approaches targeting this condition, as well as potential new treatments that have been developed recently. Traditional therapeutic strategies have shown several limitations and limited clinical benefits. Therefore, many efforts have been made to develop alternative treatments and novel therapeutic approaches, and recent findings have identified new molecules as potential anti-inflammatory agents that may exert beneficial effects in CF patients. Furthermore, the potential anti-inflammatory properties of CFTR modulators, a class of drugs that directly target the molecular defect of CF, also will be critically reviewed. Finally, we also will discuss the possible impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on CF patients, with a major focus on the consequences that the viral infection could have on the persistent inflammation in these patients.","Ghigo, Alessandra; Prono, Giulia; Riccardi, Elisa; De Rose, Virginia",Int. j. mol. sci.

METHODS: We analyze the stroke admission rate in three hospitals in New York City from January 1, 2020 through April 17, 2020, identifying all cases of acute ischemic stroke, intraparenchymal hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage. RESULTS: We confirmed 518 cases of out-of-hospital stroke. During the baseline period up to February 25, 2020, the daily stroke admission rate was stable, with the slope of the regression describing the number of admissions over time equal to -0.33 (seâ¯=â¯1.21), not significantly different from 0 (pâ¯=â¯0.79), with daily admissions averaging 41. During the pandemic period, the slope was -4.4 (seâ¯=â¯1.00); i.e., the number of stroke admissions decreased an average of 4.4 per week, (pâ¯=â¯0.005), with weekly admissions averaging 23, a reduction of 44% versus baseline. This general result was not different by patient age, sex, or race/ethnicity. CONCLUSIONS: The weekly stroke admission rate started declining two weeks prior to the local surge of coronavirus admissions. The consequences of lack of diagnosis and treatment of a large proportion of acute stroke patients are likely severe and lasting.","Esenwa, Charles; Parides, Michael K; Labovitz, Daniel L",J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis,,637

Since, tremendous efforts have been made worldwide to counter-steer and control the epidemic by now labelled as pandemic. In this contribution, we provide an overview on the potential for computer audition (CA), i.e., the usage of speech and sound analysis by artificial intelligence to help in this scenario. We first survey which types of related or contextually significant phenomena can be automatically assessed from speech or sound. These include the automatic recognition and monitoring of breathing, dry and wet coughing or sneezing sounds, speech under cold, eating behaviour, sleepiness, or pain to name but a few. Then, we consider potential use-cases for exploitation. These include risk assessment and diagnosis based on symptom histograms and their development over time, as well as monitoring of spread, social distancing and its effects, treatment and recovery, and patient wellbeing. We quickly guide further through challenges that need to be faced for real-life usage. We come to the conclusion that CA appears ready for implementation of (pre-)diagnosis and monitoring tools, and more generally provides rich and significant, yet so far untapped potential in the fight against COVID-19 spread.","Schuller, Bjorn W.; Schuller, Dagmar M.; Qian, Kun; Liu, Juan; Zheng, Huaiyuan; Li, Xiao",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.11117v1.pdf,637

382226,Berbamine inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection by compromising TRPMLs-mediated endolysosomal trafficking of ACE2,2021,"Virtual learning has become the popular and adopted form of teaching due to the COVID-19 pandemic, including learning the parts of the human body. As we move through this pandemic and look into the future of medical education, anatomic virtual models have the potential to be a key educational tool in learning the unique engineering of the human body. In this project, we look into the making of an anatomical structure, the cerebellum, which is located at the base of the skull in the posterior cranial fossa. The cerebellum largely controls the coordination of voluntary movement sequences of the body. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) data and surface and volume rendering technology found in the Amira 5.6 software was used in the creation of a three-dimensional (3D) stereoscopic virtual model of the cerebellum. An outlining process was used for each CTA image that comprised the cerebellum;a total of 73 slices of CTA data were outlined. Each outline was made using the paintbrush, blow, and lasso tools found in Amira 5.6. To refine the selected areas, the paintbrush tool along with the coronal and sagittal views were employed. Each segmented slice was then stacked to create the surface of the cerebellum, generating the 3D stereoscopic model. A smoothing filter was also applied to correct human error. End results show a 3D stereoscopic cerebellum model that can be integrated at various angles and magnifications with orthoslice CTA data and project as a 3D stereoscopic presentation in a virtual environment with a dim light background. We find that the cerebellum stereoscopic model can serve as a virtual learning tool in a classroom setting and allow students to view the cerebellum in a 3D stereoscopic presentation in order to better grasp the spatial relationship of the cerebellum with other structures in the cranial vault. Three-dimensional stereoscopic presentations along with video clips created within Amira 5.6 can be used for online anatomical learning, which allows for different visual perspectives than the traditional two-dimensional presentations.","Patel, Niki Patel Shiv Cui Dongmei",The FASEB Journal,,637

Fortunately, recombinant interferons as therapeutic products have accumulated a long history of beneficial therapeutic results in the treatment of chronic and acute viral diseases and also in the therapy of some types of cancer. One of the first antiviral treatments during the onset of COVID-19 in China was based on the use of recombinant interferon alfa 2b, so many clinicians began to use it, not only as therapy but also as a prophylactic approach, mainly in medical personnel. At the same time, basic research on interferons provided new insights that have contributed to a much better understanding of how treatment with interferons, initially considered as antivirals, actually has a much broader pharmacological scope. In this review, we briefly describe interferons, how they are induced in the event of a viral infection, and how they elicit signaling after contact with their specific receptor on target cells. Additionally, some of the genes stimulated by type I interferons are described, as well as the way interferon-mediated signaling is torpedoed by coronaviruses and in particular by SARS-CoV-2. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) gene is one of the interferon response genes. Although for many scientists this fact could result in an adverse effect of interferon treatment in COVID-19 patients, ACE2 expression contributes to the balance of the renin-angiotensin system, which is greatly affected by SARS-CoV-2 in its internalization into the cell. This manuscript also includes the relationship between type I interferons and neutrophils, NETosis, and interleukin 17. Finally, under the subtitle of ""take-home messages"", we discuss the rationale behind a timely treatment with interferons in the context of COVID-19 is emphasized.","Garcia-Del-Barco, Diana; Risco-Acevedo, Daniela; Berlanga-Acosta, Jorge; Martos-Benítez, Frank Daniel; Guillén-Nieto, Gerardo",Front Immunol,,637

The condition is mainly respiratory, and up to 5% of patients develop critical illness, a situation that has put enormous pressure on the health systems of affected countries. A high demand for care has mainly been observed in intensive care units and critical care resources, which is why the need to redistribute resources in critical medicine emerged, with an emphasis on distributive justice, which establishes the provision of care to the largest number of people and saving the largest number of lives. One principle lies in allocating resources to patients with higher life expectancy. Mechanical ventilator has been assumed to be an indivisible asset; however, simultaneous mechanical ventilation to more than one patient with COVID-19 is technically possible. Ventilator sharing is not without risks, but the principles of beneficence, non-maleficence and justice prevail. According to distributive justice, being a divisible resource, mechanical ventilator can be shared; however, we should ask ourselves if this action is ethically correct.","Vázquez-de Anda, Gilberto F; Ruíz-de Chávez, Manuel; Pérez-Castañeda, Ana I; Vázquez-Moreno, Pamela; Dávila-Fernández, Juan C; Delaye-Aguilar, Ma Guadalupe",Gac Med Mex,,637

We first evaluated the ability to predict the diagnosis from the metabotype at D0 in an independent population. Next, we assessed the feasibility of predicting the disease evolution at the 7th and 15th day. Plasma metabolome allowed us to generate a discriminant multivariate model to predict the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 in an independent population (accuracy > 74%, sensitivity, specificity > 75%).

However, there remain no very effective treatment for OAB. Pharmacotherapy is one of the best treatments, but it is not always efficient and may incur adverse events. Although behavioral therapy is another effective treatment, there are very few structured treatment manuals on how to prescribe behavioral therapy to treat OAB for whom. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a psychotherapy consisting of structured sessions to solve problems with the collaborative empiricism between therapists and patients. OAB symptoms are supposed to worsen with cognitive distortion, and CBT is expected to be effective in treating OAB by modifying such cognitive processes. In this trial, we will evaluate the efficacy of CBT for OAB. METHODS: A randomized, controlled, open-label, multicenter parallel-group superiority trial will be conducted. Participants with moderate to severe OAB symptoms with or without pharmacotherapy will be recruited and will be randomly allocated 1:1 to two different groups by minimization (age, baseline OAB severity, treatment status, types of intervention, and treating institutions). The intervention group will be prescribed an individual CBT program covering six techniques in 4 sessions (30 min each), with or without pharmacotherapy. The primary outcome is the change scores in an OAB-questionnaire (OAB-q) from baseline to the end of the trial (week 13). Secondary outcomes will include other patient reported outcome measures and the frequency volume chart. All analyses will be conducted on an intention-to-treat principle. DISCUSSION: This trial will determine the efficacy of CBT to treat OAB using a rigorous methodology. The effectiveness of CBT with a structured manual may not only lead to a new treatment option for patients suffering from OAB symptoms, but may also reduce the social burden by OAB.

It is worth highlighting that six patients had anosmia without nasal congestion as the initial symptom. At the time of discharge from the Fangcang shelter hospital, the findings on chest CT were alleviated in 95.5% (1241/1300) of the patients. However, only one patient had chest CT findings suggestive of disease progression. Symptomatic patients have higher CRP level and lower lymphocytes counts than asymptomatic patients, which might suggest that higher CRP level and lower lymphocytes counts were related to the severity of symptoms. However, CT characteristics were not statistically different between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, which might indicate that CT characteristics were not associated with the severity of symptoms in non-critical patients. In conclusion, patients with fever and anosmia but without nasal congestion are more likely to be suffering from COVID-19. Higher CRP level and lower lymphocytes counts might relate to the severity of symptoms, while CT abnormalities were not associated with the severity of symptoms in non-critical patients.","Lu, Chong Wang HanYu Chen Xiao Wu ZiLing Meng Shan He Wei Xu KaiSong Fu XinQiao Hu Yu Yang Chao Sun Hui",Chinese Medical Journal,,637
494750,Targeting glucose metabolism for treatment of COVID-19,2021,"OBJECTIVES: We aimed to develop a simple algorithm to help early identification of SARS-CoV-2 infection patients with severe progression tendency. METHODS: The univariable and multivariable analysis were computed to identify the independent predictors of COVID-19 progression. The prediction model was established in a retrospective training set of 322 COVID-19 patients and was re-evaluated in a prospective validation set of 317 COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: The multivariable analysis identified age (OR = 1.061, p = 0.028), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (OR = 1.006, p = 0.037), and CD4 count (OR = 0.993, p = 0.006) as the independent predictors of COVID-19 progression. Consequently, the age-LDH-CD4 algorithm was derived as (age × LDH)/CD4 count. In the training set, the area under the ROC curve (AUROC) of age-LDH-CD4 model was significantly higher than that of single CD4 count, LDH, or age (0.92, 0.85, 0.80, and 0.75, respectively). In the prospective validation set, the AUROC of age-LDH-CD4 model was also significantly higher than that of single CD4 count, LDH, or age (0.92, 0.75, 0.81, and 0.82, respectively). The age-LDH-CD4 &#8805; 82 has high sensitive (81%) and specific (93%) for the early identification of COVID-19 patients with severe progression tendency. CONCLUSIONS: The age-LDH-CD4 model is a simple algorithm for early identifying patients with severe progression tendency following SARS-CoV-2 infection, and warrants further validation.","Li, Qiang; Zhang, Jianliang; Ling, Yun; Li, Weixia; Zhang, Xiaoyu; Lu, Hongzhou; Chen, Liang",Infection,,637

To date, there is no evidence to suggest that consuming food is associated with COVID‐19. Nevertheless, COVID‐19's impact on food safety and security has been grave. The world is currently experiencing several supply chain issues as a direct result of extensive lockdowns and impacts on essential workers' safety. However, disruption in the food supply, while catastrophic in nature, has created opportunities for the advancement of medical science, data processing, security monitoring, foodborne pathogen detection, and food safety technology. This article will discuss the key components for food safety during the COVID‐19 pandemic. The discussion will draw from lessons learned early in the outbreak and will analyze the etiology of the disease through a food safety perspective. From there, we will discuss personal protective equipment, detection of SARS‐CoV‐2, useful surrogates to study SARS‐CoV‐2, and the expanding field of data science, from the food safety point of view. In the future, scientists can apply the knowledge to the containment of COVID‐19 and eventually to future pandemics.","Lacombe, Alison; Quintela, Irwin; Liao, Yen‐te; Wu, Vivian C.

However the literature available is disjunct on this aspect. This study is conducted to identify the prevalence of olfactory and/or gustatory dysfunction in patients with coronavirus disease in Northern part of India. It’s a cross-sectional observation study, conducted over 387 COVID-19 positive patients, at ENT dept of tertiary care hospital. A retrospective survey was conducted using a pre designed questionnaire and details of Olfactory and Gustatory dysfunction was collected. The patient’s demographic details, disease course and recovery time for olfactory (OD) and/or gustatory dysfunctions (GD) were collected. A total of 387 patients with COVID-19 completed the study. 228 (58.9%) patients suffered from influenza like illness (ILI) (fever, sore throat, dry cough, malaise, and myalgia). There was significant positive association seen between with ILI and OD and / or GD. 167/387 (43.15%) patients reported OD, and 153/387 (39.53%) reported GD. 43.71% and 50.3% patients had mild OD & GD respectively. Recovery rates for both OD and GD are high and almost similar, with 161 (96.4%) and 148 (96.73%) patients had complete recovery of smell and taste. Maximum recovery was noticed between 4 and 6 weeks. COVID-19 patients with habits have significantly high probability of developing OD &/or GD. There is a significant correlation between OD and GD and there is high probability that patients who reported to have OD will also have GD or vice versa. Prevalence of OD and GD in Indian population may not be as high as mentioned in western literature, however, both are frequent and early symptoms of COVID-19.

Vaccine targeting recombinant receptor-binding domain might hold the key for mass production of effective prophylactics to fight the COVID-19 pandemic,2020-10-06,"BACKGROUND: Chaiqin Qingning Capsule (CQ-C) is a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formula commonly used to treat respiratory infectious diseases in China. The aim of this study was to detect the effect and mechanism of CQ-C treated with influenza virus in vitro and vivo. METHODS: The cytotoxicity and antiviral activity of CQ-C in vitro was determined by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay. The regulation of CQ-C on cytokine/chemokine expression was evaluated using RT-qPCR. In addition, the effect of CQ-C on the pathway protein, NF-κB, and its phosphorylation level was verified by western blotting. After virus inoculation, BALB/c mice were administered with CQ-C of different concentrations for 7 days. Body weight, viral titer, lung pathology, and mortality of the mice were measured, and the level of inflammatory cytokines was also examined using real-time RT-qPCR. RESULTS: CQ-C inhibited the proliferation of influenza virus of various strains in vitro, with the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) ranging from 49 to 59 µg/mL. CQ-C downregulated virus-induced gene expression of IL-6, TNF-α, CXCL8, CXCL10, CCL5, and COX-2 in a dose-dependent manner in A549 cells. Also, CQ-C inhibited the expression of NF-κB protein of the signaling pathway. Moreover, a decrease of the lung index and mortality of mice was observed in the CQ-C (1 g/kg/d) group. The related cytokine/chemokine expression was also decreased in the early stages of infection in the mRNA level. CONCLUSION: As a clinically applied Chinese prescription, our study shows that CQ-C has a wide range of effects on several influenza viruses. Moreover, CQ-C could play an important role in anti-influenza activity and anti-inflammation in vitro and in vivo. Thus, CQ-C may be a promising treatment option for influenza.","Zhao, Jin; Hao, Yanbing; Xia, Xuanzi; Li, Runfeng; Huang, Xiaodong; Yang, Zifeng; Wang, Xinhua",Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34552653/; https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/6640731,637

Globally, at least four billion people were under lockdown, working remotely, homeschooling children, and facing challenges coping with quarantine and the stressful events. The present cross-sectional online survey of adult Poles (n = 1097), conducted during a nationwide quarantine, aimed to assess whether nutritional and consumer habits have been affected under these conditions. Over 43.0% and nearly 52% reported eating and snacking more, respectively, and these tendencies were more frequent in overweight and obese individuals. Almost 30% and over 18% experienced weight gain (mean ± SD 3.0 ± 1.6 kg) and loss (−2.9 ± 1.5 kg), respectively. Overweight, obese, and older subjects (aged 36–45 and >45) tended to gain weight more frequently, whereas those with underweight tended to lose it further. Increased BMI was associated with less frequent consumption of vegetables, fruit, and legumes during quarantine, and higher adherence to meat, dairy, and fast-foods. An increase in alcohol consumption was seen in 14.6%, with a higher tendency to drink more found among alcohol addicts. Over 45% of smokers experienced a rise in smoking frequency during the quarantine. The study highlights that lockdown imposed to contain an infectious agent may affect eating behaviors and dietary habits, and advocates for organized nutritional support during future epidemic-related quarantines, particularly for the most vulnerable groups, including overweight and obese subjects.","Sidor, Aleksandra; Rzymski, Piotr",Nutrients,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32503173/; https://doi.org/10.3390/nu12061657,637

The present study aimed to investigate the effects of the pandemic on neurosurgical practice and the safety of the resumption of elective procedures through implementing screening protocols in a high-volume academic public center in Iran as one of the countries severely affected by the pandemic. Methods This unmatched case-control study compared two populations of patients who underwent neurosurgical procedures between June 1, 2019- September 1, 2019, and the same period in 2020. In the prospective part of the study, patients who underwent elective procedures were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection postoperatively to evaluate the viability of our screening protocol. Results Elective and emergency procedures showed significant reduction (59.4%, n=168 vs 71.3%, n=380) and increase (28.7%, n=153 vs 40.6%, n=115) in their percentages during the pandemic period, respectively (p=0.003). The proportional distribution of neurosurgical categories remained unchanged during the pandemic period. Poisson regression showed that the reduction in total daily admissions and some categories, including spine, trauma, oncology, and infection were significantly correlated with the pandemic period. Among patients who underwent elective procedures, 0 (0.0%) and 26 (16.25%) had positive test results on day-30 and 60 postoperatively, respectively. Overall mortality rates were comparable between the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods, yet patients with concurrent SARS-CoV-2 infection showed substantially higher mortality rates (65%). Conclusion By implementing safety and screening protocols with proper resource allocation, we can maintain the emergency care capacity while minimizing the risk of hospital-acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection, complications, and mortality among neurosurgical patients during the pandemic period. Similarly, for elective procedures, according to available resources, we can allocate hospital beds for patients with a higher risk of delayed hospitalization and reassure those who are concerned about the risk of hospital-acquired infection.","Tavanaei, Roozbeh; Ahmadi, Pooria; Yazdani, Kaveh Oraii; Zali, Alireza; Oraee-Yazdani, Saeed",World Neurosurg,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wneu.2021.07.047; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1878875021010421; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34284156/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878875021010421?v=s5,637

The exact reasons for such variations are not clear yet. This review discussed the possible effects of air pollution on COVID-19 infections and mortality based on some recent evidence. The findings of most studies reviewed here demonstrate that both short-term and long-term exposure to air pollution especially PM(2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)) may contribute significantly to higher rates of COVID-19 infections and mortalities with a lesser extent also PM(10). A significant correlation has been found between air pollution and COVID-19 infections and mortality in some countries in the world. The available data also indicate that exposure to air pollution may influence COVID-19 transmission. Moreover, exposure to air pollution may increase vulnerability and have harmful effects on the prognosis of patients affected by COVID-19 infections. Further research should be conducted considering some potential confounders such as age and pre-existing medical conditions along with exposure to NO(2), PM(2.5) and other air pollutants to confirm their detrimental effects on mortalities from COVID-19.","Ali, Nurshad; Islam, Farjana",Front Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33324598/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2020.580057,637

Most learning has been shifted to online classes. So far, it is unclear whether these changes are well received within the student body. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was the evaluation of a newly developed online-based teaching concept for medical students studying radiology during the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The concept consisted of 12 online seminars of the 11-week course “Imaging Procedures”, which were combined with 31 prerecorded video presentations. Five weeks after the start of the summer term, we conducted an anonymous online survey, which consisted of 12 questions and a box for additional comments. Furthermore, we analysed the number of requests of the presentations, the duration and the average viewing time. RESULTS: In all, 110 of 213 students (51.6%) completed the survey; 72.7% stated that the new teaching concept drew their interest for radiology, 78.2% agreed that it incited self-study as well as would facilitate time- and place-independent learning (95.5%). The majority indicated that the time investment for the video presentations was appropriate, but shorter video sections would simplify the learning process (70.9%) and the ideal timeframe would be 10–20 min. The majority (80.9%) agreed that the concept should be maintained in upcoming semesters. CONCLUSIONS: This newly developed online-based teaching concept enjoys high acceptance rates among students. It offers advantages such as time- and location-independent learning, possibilities for self-study and should be maintained in upcoming semesters after the end of social distancing due to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Surov, Alexey; March, Christine; Pech, Maciej",Radiologe,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33416926/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00117-020-00793-0,637

Materials and methods Eligible studies evaluating the prognostic value of fasting BG (FBG) and random BG (RBG) levels in predicting COVID-19 outcomes were included and assessed for risk of bias with the Quality in Prognosis Studies tool. Random-effects high-vs-low meta-analysis followed by dose-response analysis using generalized least squares model in a two-stage random-effects meta-analysis were conducted. Potential non-linear association was explored using restricted cubic splines and pooled using restricted maximum likelihood model in a multivariate meta-analysis. Results The search yielded 35 studies involving a total of 14,502 patients. We discovered independent association between admission FBG and poor prognosis in COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, we demonstrated non-linear relationship between admission FBG and severity (Pnon-linearity<0.001), where each 1 mmol/L increase augmented the risk of COVID-19 severity by 33% (risk ratio 1.33 [95% CI: 1.26-1.40]). Albeit exhibiting similar trends, study scarcity limited the strength of evidence on the independent prognostic value of admission RBG. GRADE assessment yielded high-quality evidence for the association between admission FBG and COVID-19 severity, and moderate-quality evidence for its association with mortality and poor outcomes, while the other assessments yielded very low-to-low quality. Conclusion High level of FBG at admission was independently associated with poor prognosis in COVID-19 patients. Further researches to confirm the observed prognostic value of admission RBG and to ascertain the estimated dose-response risk between admission FBG and on COVID-19 severity are required.","Lazarus, G.; Audrey, J.; Wangsaputra, V.

It is potentially life threatening and is treated initially with intravenous immunoglobulin and aspirin but may require anti-inflammatory monoclonal antibody treatment in severe cases. SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause macrophage activation syndrome, chilblains, and flares of existing rheumatologic diseases. The pandemic has led to later presentation of some rheumatologic conditions as parents and patients have avoided health care settings.

In this online survey distributed to two national pediatric ophthalmology list-servs, respondents in July-August 2020 (n = 104) compared with respondents in March-April 2020 (n = 171) were more likely to report not using and not planning on using telemedicine. The July-August respondents who did not use telemedicine were concerned about the limitations in care provided, challenges with implementation, and perceived negative effects on the doctor-patient relationship. These findings demonstrate a lack of sustained uptake of telemedicine in the first 6 months of the pandemic and concerns that should be addressed to facilitate integration of this approach in pediatric ophthalmic care.","Vongsachang, Hursuong; Lagstein, Oded; Boland, Michael V.; Repka, Michael X.; Kraus, Courtney; Collins, Megan E.",J AAPOS,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1091853121005401?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34600105/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1091853121005401; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaapos.2021.05.018,637

Enterovirus 71 (EV71) has been found to contribute to numerous severe clinical symptoms which result in death. The exact mechanism by which EV71 influences miR‐9 expression is unknown, and the relationship between miR‐9 and EV71 is still unclear. Here, miR‐9 expression was found to be impaired upon EV71 infection in several cell lines and in an EV71 infection mouse model. Additionally, we confirmed that EV71 infection induces robust expression of pro‐inflammatory cytokines (TNF‐α, IL‐6, and IL‐1) and interferons (IFN‐α and IFN‐β). Overexpression of miR‐9 attenuated EV71 proliferation and reduced protein and gene expressions of virion protein 1 (VP1) of EV71. Furthermore, we observed that the inflammation caused by EV71 infection was restored to a moderate level via miR‐9 overexpression. Nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) in the retinoic acid‐induced gene 1 (RIG‐I) signaling pathway, but not interferon regulating factor 3 (IRF3), was significantly decreased and inactivated by ectopic miR‐9 expression. Moreover, in mouse infection experiments, administration of miR‐9 agomirs caused a significant decrease in VP1 levels and pro‐inflammatory cytokine production after viral inoculation. Taken together, the present data demonstrate that miR‐9 exerts an anti‐EV71 effect in cells and a mouse model via mediating NFκB activity of the RIG‐I signal pathway, thereby suggesting a new candidate for antiviral drug development.","Li, Bing; Zheng, Junqing",FEBS Open Bio,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30186747/; https://doi.org/10.1002/2211-5463.12490,637
663313,COVID-19-activated SREBP2 disturbs cholesterol biosynthesis and leads to cytokine storm,2020-09-03,"Wastewater-based surveillance of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is used to monitor the population-level prevalence of the COVID-19 disease. In many cases, due to lockdowns or analytical delays, the analysis of wastewater samples might only be possible after prolonged storage. In this study, the effect of storage conditions on the RNA copy numbers of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in wastewater influent was studied and compared to the persistence of norovirus over time at 4 °C, −20 °C, and −75 °C using the reverse-transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) assays E-Sarbeco, N2, and norovirus GII. For the first time in Finland, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was tested in 24 h composite influent wastewater samples collected from Viikinmäki wastewater treatment plant, Helsinki, Finland. The detected and quantified SARS-CoV-2 RNA copy numbers of the wastewater sample aliquots taken during 19–20 April 2020 and stored for 29, 64, and 84 days remained surprisingly stable. In the stored samples, the SARS betacoronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 copy numbers, but not the norovirus GII copy numbers, seemed slightly higher when analyzed from the pre-centrifuged pellet—that is, the particulate matter of the influent—as compared with the supernatant (i.e., water fraction) used for ultrafiltration, although the difference was not statistically significant. Furthermore, when wastewater was spiked with SARS-CoV-2, linear decay at 4 °C was observed on the first 28 days, while no decay was visible within 58 days at −20 °C or −75 °C. In conclusion, freezing temperatures should be used for storage when immediate SARS-CoV-2 RNA analysis from the wastewater influent is not possible. Analysis of the particulate matter of the sample, in addition to the water fraction, can improve the detection frequency.","Hokajärvi, Anna-Maria; Rytkönen, Annastiina; Tiwari, Ananda; Kauppinen, Ari; Oikarinen, Sami; Lehto, Kirsi-Maarit; Kankaanpää, Aino; Gunnar, Teemu; Al-Hello, Haider; Blomqvist, Soile; Miettinen, Ilkka T.; Savolainen-Kopra, Carita; Pitkänen, Tarja",Sci Total Environ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33513496/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969721003405?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.145274; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969721003405,637

The study aims to describe the development and validation of the 7-item COVID-19 Student Stress Questionnaire (CSSQ), a measurement tool to assess COVID-19-related sources of stress among university students. The CSSQ was developed and validated with 514 Italian university students. Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) was conducted with one split-half sub-sample to investigate the underlining dimensional structure, suggesting a three-component solution, which was confirmed by the Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) with the second one split-half sub-sample (CFI = 0.95; TLI = 0.95; RMSEA = 0.06). The CSSQ three subscales measure COVID-19 students’ stressors related to (1) Relationships and Academic Life (i.e., relationships with relatives, colleagues, professors, and academic studying); (2) Isolation (i.e., social isolation and couple’s relationship, intimacy and sexual life); (3) Fear of Contagion. A Global Stress score was also provided. The questionnaire revealed a satisfactory internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.71; McDonald’s omega = 0.71). Evidence was also provided for convergent and discriminant validity. The study provided a brief, valid and reliable measure to assess perceived stress to be used for understanding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown among university students and for developing tailored interventions fostering their wellbeing.","Zurlo, Maria Clelia; Cattaneo Della Volta, Maria Francesca; Vallone, Federica",Front Psychol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.576758; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33192888/,637
686932,A suspicious role of interferon in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 by enhancing expression of ACE2,2020-05-21,"The development of drugs for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) is a global challenge. In Japan, remdesivir was approved in May 2020 for COVID‐19 caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) infection. In February 2021, a vaccine against COVID‐19 was approved. These two approvals were made using the Special Approval for Emergency system in Japan. This Japanese system was started in 2010 and has been used to approve four drugs to date, including remdesivir and the Pfizer COVID‐19 vaccine. This paper discusses future challenges for Japan's Special Approval for Emergency system and organizes what can be learned from experiences to date. As a result, I would like to point Out the following issues. (i) Special Approval for Emergency is a system for approving drugs approved overseas, not a system for approving drugs originally developed in Japan. A system to approve drugs that have not been approved in foreign countries needs to be considered. (ii) In the Special Approval for Emergency system, it is necessary to ensure that postmarketing activities are conducted in accordance with the Risk Management Plan and the conditions of approval, to disclose the results in a timely and speedy manner, and to judge the appropriateness of continued approval based on the results of postmarketing activities.","Maeda, Hideki",Clin Pharmacol Ther,https://doi.org/10.1002/cpt.2310; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34032279/,637
