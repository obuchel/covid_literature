3495,"Prevalence of Avian Influenza A(H5) and A(H9) Viruses in Live Bird Markets, Bangladesh",2018-12-11,"We conducted a cross-sectional study in live bird markets (LBMs) in Dhaka and Chittagong, Bangladesh, to estimate the prevalence of avian influenza A(H5) and A(H9) viruses in different types of poultry and environmental areas by using Bayesian hierarchical logistic regression models. We detected these viruses in nearly all LBMs. Prevalence of A(H5) virus was higher in waterfowl than in chickens, whereas prevalence of A(H9) virus was higher in chickens than in waterfowl and, among chicken types, in industrial broilers than in cross-breeds and indigenous breeds. LBMs with >1 wholesaler were more frequently contaminated by A(H5) virus than retail-only LBMs. Prevalence of A(H9) virus in poultry and level of environmental contamination were also higher in LBMs with >1 wholesaler. We found a high level of circulation of both avian influenza viruses in surveyed LBMs. Prevalence was influenced by type of poultry, environmental site, and trading.","Kim, Younjung; Biswas, Paritosh K.; Giasuddin, Mohammad; Hasan, Mahmudul; Mahmud, Rashed; Chang, Yu-Mei; Essen, Steve; Samad, Mohammed A.; Lewis, Nicola S.; Brown, Ian H.; Moyen, Natalie; Hoque, Md.

10274,Threats to blood safety posed by emerging protozoan pathogens,2004-06-22,"We characterized the pattern of ultrasonographic contrast enhancement of the small intestinal wall using a commercial contrast medium (Sonovue(®)) in 10 healthy awake cats. Subjectively, a rapid intense enhancement of the serosal and submucosal layers was followed by gradual enhancement of the entire wall section during the early phase. At peak enhancement, there was a subjective loss of demarcation between intestinal wall layers. In the late phase, there was a gradual wash out of signal from the intestinal wall. Submucosal wash out occurred last. Time‐intensity curves were generated for selected regions in the intestinal wall and multiple perfusion parameters were calculated for each cat. Perfusion parameters included arrival time (7.64 ± 2.23 s), baseline intensity (1.04 ± 0.04 a.u.), time to peak from injection (10.74 ± 2.08 s), time to peak from initial rise (3.1 ± 1.15), peak intensity (8.92 ± 3.72 a.u.), wash‐in rate (2.06 ± 0.70 a.u./s) and wash‐out rate (−1.07 ± 0.91 a.u./s). The perfusion pattern of normal feline small bowel may be useful for characterizing feline gastrointestinal disorders that involve the intestinal wall.","DIANA, ALESSIA; SPECCHI, SWAN; BARON TOALDO, MARCO; CHIOCCHETTI, ROBERTO; LAGHI, ANDREA; CIPONE, MARIO",Vet Radiol Ultrasound,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7169303/,415

DESIGN: A clinical prospective study, at the rheumatology clinic of the Nazareth Hospital in Nazareth, recruiting consecutively patients approved for medical cannabis, evaluating their saliva flow, pH and microbial load of Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus, prior to and under medical cannabis treatment. METHODS: Patients recently licensed for medical cannabis treatment, were recruited just prior to starting medical cannabis consumption (week 0), 1 and 4 weeks later, patients provided 5-minute time saliva samples, which were measured for their volume and pH, and cultured on a special microbial kit, evaluating the growth of Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus. RESULTS: Out of 16 patients enrolled, 14 were female and had fibromyalgia. The mean age of the patients was 52.8±12.9 years. The mean saliva flow at week 0, week 1 and week 4 were 5.38±3.36 ml/5-minutes, 6 (p = 0.769) and 5.45 (p = 0.391), respectively, and for saliva pH were 6.28, 5.94 (p = 0.51) and 5.5 (p = 0.07) respectively also. The mean Streptococcus mutans growth score at weeks 0, 1 and 4 was1.8±0.75, 1.6±0.83 (p = 0.234), and 2.4±0.84 (p = 0.058), respectively. The mean Lactobacilli growth score at weeks 0, 1 and 4 was 2.59±0.88, 3.1±0.69 (p = 0.033) and 3.3±0.67 (p = 0.025), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study show that medical cannabis consumption has no significant effect on saliva volume or pH, but it may be associated with changes in salivary levels of oral microbes such as Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacilli.","Habib, George; Steinberg, Doron; Jabbour, Adel",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7880425/,415
22188,Coronaviruses: Molecular and Cellular Biology,2008-04-11,"BACKGROUND: Robotic gastrectomy (RG) has increased since being covered by universal health insurance in 2018. However, to ensure patient safety the operating surgeon and facility must meet specific requirements. We aimed to determine whether RG has been safely implemented under the requirements for universal health insurance in Japan. METHODS: Data of consecutive patients with primary gastric cancer who underwent minimally invasive total or distal gastrectomy—performed by a surgeon certified by the Japan Society for Endoscopic Surgery (JSES) endoscopic surgical skill qualification system (ESSQS) between October 2018 and December 2019—were extracted from the gastrointestinal surgery section of the National Clinical Database (NCD). The primary outcome was morbidity over Clavien–Dindo classification grade IIIa. Patient demographics and hospital volume were matched between RG and laparoscopic gastrectomy (LG) using propensity score-matched analysis (PSM), and the short-term outcomes of RG and LG were compared. RESULTS: After PSM, 2671 patients who underwent RG and 2671 who underwent LG were retrieved (from a total of 9881), and the standardized difference of all the confounding factors reduced to 0.07 or less. Morbidity rates did not differ between the RG and LG patients (RG, 4.9% vs. LG, 3.9%; p = 0.084). No difference was observed in 30-day mortality (RG, 0.2% vs. LG, 0.1%; p = 0.754). The reoperation rate was greater following RG (RG, 2.2% vs. LG, 1.2%; p = 0.004); however, the duration of postoperative hospitalization was shorter (RG, 10 [8–13] days vs. LG, 11 [9–14] days; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Insurance-covered RG has been safely implemented nationwide.","Suda, Koichi; Yamamoto, Hiroyuki; Nishigori, Tatsuto; Obama, Kazutaka; Yoda, Yukie; Hikage, Makoto; Shibasaki, Susumu; Tanaka, Tsuyoshi; Kakeji, Yoshihiro; Inomata, Masafumi; Kitagawa, Yuko; Miyata, Hiroaki; Terashima, Masanori; Noshiro, Hirokazu; Uyama, Ichiro",Gastric Cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8505217/,415

32343,Letter to the Editor: “Embracing Disruptive Change During the SARS-CoV 2 Pandemic”,2020-05-11,"Users’ real demographic attributes is impressively useful for intelligent marketing, automatic advertising and human-computer interaction. Traditional method on attribute prediction make great effort on the study of social network data, but ignore massive volumes of disparate, dynamic, and temporal data derived from ubiquitous mobile and sensor devices. For example, daily walking step counts produced by pedometer. Multiple demographic prediction on temporal data have two problems. First one is that differential effectiveness of different time period data for prediction is unclear. And another one is how to effectively learn the complementary correlations between different attributes. To address the above problem, we propose a novel model named Correlation-Aware Neural Embedding with Attention (CANEA), which first directly separates different attribute oriented feature using separated embedding layer, and use attention mechanism to assign a higher weight to dominant time point. Then it captures informative correlations using correlation learning layer. Finally we obtain the refined task-specific representations with optimal correlation information for predicting certain attributes. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our method.","Jiang, Yiwen; Tang, Wei; Gao, Neng; Xiang, Ji; Tu, Chenyang; Li, Min",Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206160/,415

Previous work has shown that the quantitative reachability problem for clock-dependent probabilistic timed automata with at least three clocks is undecidable. In this paper, we consider the subclass of clock-dependent probabilistic timed automata that have one clock, that have clock dependencies described by affine functions, and that satisfy an initialisation condition requiring that, at some point between taking edges with non-trivial clock dependencies, the clock must have an integer value. We present an approach for solving in polynomial time quantitative and qualitative reachability problems of such one-clock initialised clock-dependent probabilistic timed automata.

Due to changing data and behavior of the current epidemic, appropriate pharmacological techniques to cure are getting delayed day by day. The estimated trends of the global and Indian region for COVID-19 epidemic were predicted for the next 21 days till 05/05/2020 on the data recorded till 14/04/2020 in the present work. The main focus of the work was to estimate the trends of COVID-19 outbreak on population, especially the high-risk age group of elderly people (with age 50 years and greater) in the Republic of India. It was observed that this identified age-group could be more prone to SARS-CoV-2 virus infection and chances of death in this age group could be more. The high-risk Indian states/regions were also identified throughout the nation and trends for infection, death, and cured cases were predicted for the next 21 days. The outcome of the present work was presented in terms of suggestions that the proper social and medical care for the identified high-risk age group of elderly people of the Indian population should be required to prevent the COVID-19 community transmission. The work also supported the extension in countrywide proper lockdown, mass testing, and also the strict rules to follow social distancing.","Singh, Harjit Pal; Khullar, Vikas; Sharma, Monica",Augment Hum Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7327483/,415

Once acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) occurs as a secondary condition, treatment is extremely difficult and the mortality rate is very high. CASE PRESENTATION: The patient was a 49-year-old. He was admitted to the hospital because he had experienced a fever and cough for 4 days. Hemorrhage, respiratory failure, ARDS and other symptoms appeared soon after admission. Due to severe pulmonary hemorrhage secondary to ARDS, mechanical ventilation was performed through tracheal intubation. During intubation, the patient suffered cardiac arrest, and the patient’s condition worsened. He was confirmed to have leptospirosis through second-generation sequencing of the alveolar lavage fluid. Finally, we successfully treated the patient with penicillin as an anti-infective medication and venous-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (v-vECMO). To the best of our knowledge, this report is the first to describe the successful application of ECMO in mainland China. CONCLUSIONS: Leptospirosis can induce serious but transient ARDS with a better prognosis than other causes of ARDS. Our patient was successfully treated with V-vECMO.","Wang, H. J.; Chen, G.

The policies and support systems designed by host governments highlight the lack of social justice and raise concerns for scholarly attention. Considering the experiences of international migrants living in the UK during the Covid‐19 lockdown from the theoretical perspective of coping, this interpretivist study investigates international migrants’ coping strategies adopted during the first UK national lockdown. Data collected from 60 Chinese, Italian and Iranian migrants using semi‐structured interviews during the lockdown period were analysed thematically using NVivo. The findings show that migrants adopted multi‐layered and multi‐phase coping strategies. To cope with the anxiety and uncertainties caused by the pandemic, they initiated new practices informed by both home and host institution logics. Nevertheless, the hostile context's responses provoked unexpected new worries and triggered the adoption of additional and compromising practices. The paper illustrates how coping became paradoxical because migrants had to cope with the hostile reactions that their initial coping strategies provoked in the host environment. By introducing the new concept of coping with coping, this paper extends previous theoretical debate and leads to several managerial implications for governments and policymakers.","Yen, Dorothy Ai‐wan; Cappellini, Benedetta; Yang, Hsiao‐Pei (Sophie); Gupta, Suraksha",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8209924/,415

The extent to which these treatments remain in use is unknown. We conducted a multi-center retrospective cohort study of adult patients with severe TBI admitted to five neurotrauma centers across Australia between April 2013 and March 2015. Patients were identified from local trauma and intensive care unit registries and followed until hospital discharge. Main outcome measures were the administration of intravenous albumin and decompressive craniectomy for intracranial hypertension, and hospital outcomes. Analyses were predominantly descriptive. There were 303 patients with severe TBI, of whom a minority received albumin (6.9%) or underwent early decompressive craniectomy for treatment of refractory intracranial hypertension complicating diffuse TBI (2.3%). The median (IQR) age was 35 (24, 58), and most injuries were caused by road traffic accidents (57.4%) or falls (25.1%). Overall 34.3% of patients died while in hospital and the remainder were discharged to rehabilitation (44.6%), other healthcare facilities (4.6%) or home (16.5%).

A meta-analysis was conducted to summarize and clarify this association systematically. METHODS A comprehensive search was performed in PubMed, Embase and Web of Sciences, and twenty-two studies were selected from the literature search. Pooled odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were estimated by either fixed- or random-effects models. RESULTS Four outcomes were evaluated: (a) haemoglobin decline: significant associations with haemoglobin decline were found for rs1127354 CC VS CA + AA (OR = 10.59, 95% CI = 6.39-17.54); (b) severe anaemia: significant association with severe anaemia was observed for rs1127354 CC VS CA + AA (OR = 16.24, 95% CI = 6.21-42.43); (c) sustained virological response (SVR): CC genotype carriers had a decrease SVR during treatment (OR = 0.65, 95% CI = 0.52-0.81); (d) RBV dose reduction or stopping treatment: although statistical evidence of an association was found between the polymorphism and RBV dose reduction during treatment (OR = 1.80, 95% CI = 1.03-3.13), the sensitivity analysis suggested this result was not robust.

Few families have been described and the genotypic and phenotypic spectrum is poorly defined, with variants in DDX58 (DExD/H-box helicase 58) being one of two identified causes, classified as SGMRT2. METHODS Families underwent deep systemic phenotyping and exome sequencing. Functional characterisation with in vitro luciferase assays and in vivo interferon signature using bulk and single cell RNA sequencing was performed. RESULTS We have identified a novel DDX58 variant c.1529A>T p.(Glu510Val) that segregates with disease in two families with SGMRT2. Patients in these families have widely variable phenotypic features and different ethnic background, with some being severely affected by systemic features and others solely with glaucoma. JOAG was present in all individuals affected with the syndrome. Furthermore, detailed evaluation of skin rash in one patient revealed sparse inflammatory infiltrates in a unique distribution. Functional analysis showed that the DDX58 variant is a dominant gain-of-function activator of interferon pathways in the absence of exogenous RNA ligands. Single cell RNA sequencing of patient lesional skin revealed a cellular activation of interferon-stimulated gene expression in keratinocytes and fibroblasts but not in neighbouring healthy skin. CONCLUSIONS These results expand the genotypic spectrum of DDX58-associated disease, provide the first detailed description of ocular and dermatological phenotypes, expand our understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of this condition and provide a platform for testing response to therapy.","Prasov, Lev; Bohnsack, Brenda L; El Husny, Antonette S; Tsoi, Lam C; Guan, Bin; Kahlenberg, J Michelle; Almeida, Edmundo; Wang, Haitao; Cowen, Edward W; De Jesus, Adriana A; Jani, Priyam; Billi, Allison C; Moroi, Sayoko E; Wasikowski, Rachael; Almeida, Izabela; Almeida, Luciana N; Kok, Fernando; Garnai, Sarah J; Mian, Shahzad I; Chen, Marcus Y; Warner, Blake M; Ferreira, Carlos R; Goldbach-Mansky, Raphaela; Hur, Sun; Brooks, Brian P; Richards, Julia E; Hufnagel, Robert B; Gudjonsson, Johann E",Journal of medical genetics,https://doi.org/10.1136/jmedgenet-2020-107447; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33495304/,415

OD data are very informative but many are not peer-reviewed, often inconclusive and may reveal variable and sometimes contradictory results. This is often due to incongruent data of subjective and objective OD testing. Mechanistic pathways of OD and taste dysfunction (TD) are slowly unveiling, not infrequently extrapolated from historical models of SARS and MERS and are still partly unclear. RECENT FINDINGS We reviewed the literature on OD and TD during the COVID-19 pandemic analyzing current data on pathogenesis and clinical correlates including prevalence, recovery rates, risk factors, and predictive power. Also, we evaluated various methods of subjective and objective olfactory testing and discussed challenges in management of patients with OD and rhinitis during the pandemic. SUMMARY Subjective evaluation of smell disturbances during COVID-19 pandemic likely underestimates true prevalence, severity, and recovery rates of OD when compared to objective testing. OD is predictive of COVID-19 infection, more so when associated with TD.

This retrospective chart review was undertaken to explore postoperative pain within 48 hours among patients who underwent laparoscopic liver resections (LLR), receiving either IA with or without patient-controlled analgesia (IA±PCA) versus PCA alone. METHODS After ethics approval, charts were reviewed for adult patients who underwent LLR between January 2016 and April 2019, and had IA±PCA or PCA alone. Patients with any contraindication to IA with morphine, obstructive sleep apnea, body mass index >40 kg/m2, history of chronic pain, and/or history of drug use were excluded. Descriptive statistics used to describe postoperative pain levels at 48 hours by treatment group for each pain outcome. RESULTS Of 111 patients identified, 79 patients were finally included; 22 patients had IA±PCA and 57 patients had PCA only. There were no statistically significant differences in baseline characteristics, use of non-opioid pain control, and postoperative complications between the two groups. IA use was associated with reduced postoperative opioid consumption (measured in oral morphine equivalents) compared to PCA alone (mean difference [95% confidence interval] -45.92 [-83.10 to -8.75]; p=0.016). CONCLUSIONS IA has the potential to decrease postoperative opioid use for patients undergoing LLR, and appears to be safe and effective in the setting of LLR. These findings are consistent with the ERAS Society recommendations for laparoscopic colorectal surgery.","Liu, YiChen; Vanniyasingam, Thuva; Tidy, Antonella; Yao, William; Shin, David; Serrano, Pablo E; Nair, Saeda",Minerva anestesiologica,https://doi.org/10.23736/s0375-9393.21.15255-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33594875/,415
72179,Factors Associated With Severe SARS-CoV-2 Infection.,2020-12-15,"Objective: To investigate the application of severity classification according to the protocol on the Diagnosis and Treatment of coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19)by the National Health Commission of China, pneumonia severity index(PSI) and CURB-65 in risk stratification and prognostic assessment of COVID-19. Methods: Clinical data of 234 in-hospital patients with COVID-19 were collected and retrospectively reviewed in Wuhan Tongji Hospital. Patients were divided into 3 groups (common, severe, and critical type) at admission according to the sixth version of the protocol issued by the National Health Commission of China on Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19. At the same time, the severity of pneumonia was calculated by PSI and CURB-65, and the patients were stratified into 3 risk groups, namely mild, moderate, and severe groups. The hospital mortality rate was evaluated in each group. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values, negative predictive values, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic(ROC) curve(AUC) for predicting hospital mortality in each rule were assessed. Results: According to the severity classification of Chinese protocol, the proportion of patients with common type, severe type, and the critical type was 15.8%, 75.6%, and 8.5%, respectively. No in-hospital death occurred in the common type. As for PSI and CURB-65, greater proportions of patients were classified as low risk(79.1% and 75.6%, respectively), while smaller proportions of patients were classified as moderate and high risk(16.2%, 15.0%; 4.7%, 9.4%, respectively). In-hospital death occurred in low and moderate risk patients identified by these 2 scoring systems. The mortality of the critical group of the Chinese protocol was 65%, and the sensitivity and specificity of predicting in-hospital mortality were 36.4% and 97.0%, respectively. The mortality in the high risk group of PSI and CURB-65 was 100% and 77.3%. The risk class V of PSI and CURB-65 score 3-5 had high specificity(100% and 97.4%, respectively)but low sensitivity(33.3% and 51.5%, respectively)in predicting in-hospital mortality. The AUC of the Chinese protocol severity classification, PSI, and CURB-65 was 0.735, 0.951, and 0.912. The optimal cut-off point of PSI was risk class Ⅳ, and the sensitivity and specificity for predicting mortality were 90.9% and 90.5%. The optimal cut-off point of CURB-65 was score 2, and the corresponding sensitivity and specificity were 84.8% and 85.6%. Conclusions: PSI and CURB-65 can be used for risk stratification and prognostic assessment in patients with COVID-19.","Wang, X; Hu, Z W; Hu, Y; Cheng, Y; Zhang, H; Li, H C; Ma, J; Wang, G F; Zhao, J P",Zhonghua jie he he hu xi za zhi = Zhonghua jiehe he huxi zazhi = Chinese journal of tuberculosis and respiratory diseases,https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn112147-20200226-00186; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32992436/,415

RESULTS Of the 121 participants, 24% shared e-cigarettes every day and 76% shared some days. The most common setting (91%) for sharing was at social gatherings, and participants shared most often (52%) with one or two people, which happened most often (99%) with friends. The top reason (80%) for sharing e-cigarettes was to feel the effects of nicotine. CONCLUSIONS The finds support the need to address sharing behavior in youth e-cigarette use and the need for more stringent e-cigarette policies and cessation resources.","Seitz, Christopher M; Staley, Megan E; Kearley, Justin; Wright, Lauren; Bowman, Rachel; Phillips, Celeste; Orsini, Muhsin Michael",Journal of American college health : J of ACH,https://doi.org/10.1080/07448481.2020.1800710; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32877620/,415

Behind the daily tally of deaths and cases of infection are individuals and families who are experiencing the ultimate consequence of this disease. Every aspect of our lives has been affected and these affects are amplified for those who have to cocoon and have conditions such as dementia. There is little opportunity to directly hear the experience of those 'vulnerable adults' who have been self-isolating for many weeks now. This letter takes the form of a reflective conversation with a person living with dementia. Honouring the principles of public and patient involvement (PPI), it is an attempt to give voice to the experience of one of the many thousands of vulnerable people during the COVID-19 pandemic. As well as describing the effect on her daily life, Helen describes what supports would help at this time.

This study investigated a novel method of laparoscopic TEP repair without mesh fixation. METHODS This study reviewed data from about two-hundred and forty-one laparoscopic TEP repairs on 219 patients, which were performed between December 2004 and October 2005. RESULTS There were no statistically significant differences in the recurrence rate, seroma formation, and hospital stay. However, the mean operation time was shorter in the internal plug mesh group than the fixation group (p = 0.009), and post-operative pain only occurred in 4 cases in the internal plug mesh group in comparison to 29 cases in the mesh fixation group (p = 0.014). CONCLUSIONS An internal plug mesh without fixation might reduce post-operative pain after laparoscopic TEP repair of an inguinal hernia. Internal plug mesh without fixation may be an alternative method in laparoscopic TEP repair, especially for those involving indirect hernias.","Choi, Yoon Young; Kim, Zisun; Hur, Kyung Yul",Surgery today,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00595-012-0276-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22850985/,415

In this brief, the relevant emerging dynamics are further investigated. Evidence that this nonlinear model demonstrates critical dynamics is scrutinized within the frame of the physics of critical phenomena. Additionally, the concept of criticality over the infected population fraction in epidemics (or a pandemic) is introduced and its importance is discussed, highlighting the emergence of the critical slowdown phenomenon. A simple method is proposed for estimating how far away a population is from this ""singular"" state, by utilizing the theory of critical phenomena. Finally, a dynamic approach applying the self-organized diffusion model is proposed, resulting in more accurate simulations, which can verify the effectiveness of restrictive measures. All the above are supported by real epidemic data case studies.","Contoyiannis, Y; Stavrinides, S G; Hanias, M P; Kampitakis, M; Papadopoulos, P; Picos, R; Potirakis, S M; Kosmidis, E K",Chaos,https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0046772; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34251243/,415

The role of silylation in the qualitative and quantitative analysis of bisphenols was investigated. Partial degradation occurred for selected targets during hot injection with the presence of a silylation agent. A PSA (primary and secondary amines) sorbent placed on the top of the solid-phase extraction (SPE) column sorbent was found to be a matrix component trap, mostly for humic acids. The whole water analysis was performed by washing the filters with methanol and recycling the extract to the sample. The validation of SPE-GC/MS(SIM) gave limits of detection of 1-50 ng/L for ten target bisphenols with a method recovery of between 87 and 133%. The application of the method was tested by the analysis of wastewater sampled from three wastewater treatment plants located in Poland, and municipal surface waters.

This study aimed to assess the commercial whey products (CWP) whey protein isolate (WPI), galacto-oligosaccharide-whey protein concentrate (GOS-W) and glycomacropeptide (GMP) for their potential to improve intestinal health in vitro using HT29-MTX intestinal goblet and Caco-2 epithelial cells. Results from HT29-MTX culture showed that WPI mitigated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production at a higher extent compared to GOS-W or GMP. However, GMP downregulated the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced TLR-4 inflammatory pathway with the highest potency compared to the other CWP. Biomarkers of epithelial integrity assessed on both cell lines showed tight junction proteins claudin-1, claudin-3, occludin (OCC), and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) upregulation by GMP in HT29-MTX (1.33-1.93-fold of control) and in Caco-2 cells (1.56-2.09-fold of control). All CWP increased transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) in TNF-α challenged Caco-2/HT29-MTX co-culture monolayer (p < 0.05), but only GMP was similar to the positive control TGF-β1, known for its role in promoting epithelial barrier function. The TNF-α-induced co-culture monolayer permeability was prevented at similar levels by all CWP (p < 0.05). In conclusion, CWP may be used as functional food ingredients to protect against intestinal disorders with emphasis on the GMP enhanced anti-inflammatory and intestinal barrier function properties. Further in vivo studies are guaranteed to validate these findings.","Arbizu, Shirley; Chew, Boon; Mertens-Talcott, Susanne U; Noratto, Giuliana",Food & function,https://doi.org/10.1039/d0fo00487a; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32633745/,415
94128,Symposium 5.,2019,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The developing nervous system is particularly vulnerable to late adverse effects of cranial radiation therapy, such as leukoencephalopathy, microbleeds, and cavernomas. Cystlike lesions have been rarely described and characterized in the literature. We aimed to characterize cystlike lesions, their risk factors, and association with other late adverse effects. MATERIALS AND METHODS Children treated for brain tumors during a 30-year period (n = 139) were included. We documented imaging findings, focusing on cystlike lesion development and its relationship with clinical history and other imaging findings. Multivariable analysis was performed using logistic regression and negative binomial regression models. RESULTS Cystlike lesions developed in 16.5% of patients treated with radiotherapy, with a median of 2 years until the development of the first lesion. For every 4-year age increase, there were 50% decreased odds of developing lesions and a 50% decrease in the average count of lesions. Females demonstrated a 4.00 rate ratio of developing a higher number of lesions. Patients who underwent chemoradiotherapy had 3.20 increased odds of developing cystlike lesions compared with patients with radiation therapy alone. A larger proportion of patients treated with methotrexate (25%) developed cystlike lesions, but this was not statistically significant. Cystlike lesions tended to develop in cerebral locations where leukoencephalopathy was worse. A strong relationship was found between the development of cystlike lesions and leukoencephalopathy severity. CONCLUSIONS Cystlike lesions are frequent and under-reported late adverse effects of cranial radiation therapy in children. Younger age, chemoradiotherapy, and the severity of leukoencephalopathy represent risk factors for the development of cystlike lesions.","Veiga, M G D; Fragata, I; Passos, J; Alves, M; Papoila, A L; Salgado, D",AJNR.

Advanced glycation end products are produced under the influence of oxidative stress and in the skin (measured by skin autofluorescence [SAF]) serve as marker for cumulative oxidative stress. Aim of study was to determine whether SAF is associated with presence of affective disorders. METHODS Participants in the Lifelines cohort study who had completed the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview for affective disorders and a SAF-measurement were included. Cross-sectional associations between SAF and presence of the following psychiatric disorders were investigated through logistic regression analyses adjusted for sociodemographic factors, cardiometabolic parameters, and somatic morbidities: major depressive disorder, dysthymia, generalised anxiety disorder, panic disorder or social phobia. RESULTS Of 81,041 included participants (41.7% male, aged 18-91 years), 6676 (8.2%) were cases with an affective disorder. SAF was associated with presence of affective disorders (OR=1.09 [95%CI 1.07-1.12], P<.001 adjusted for sociodemographic factors). Association with major depressive disorder was strongest and significant after adjustment for all confounders (OR=1.31 [95%CI 1.25-1.36], P<.001 in the crude model; OR=1.12 [95%CI 1.07-1.17], P<.001 in the fully adjusted model). For other disorders, associations lost significance after adjustment for cardiometabolic parameters and somatic morbidities. LIMITATIONS Persons of non-Western descent and severely (mentally or physically) ill individuals were underrepresented. CONCLUSIONS SAF was associated with presence of affective disorders, suggesting a link between these disorders and cumulative oxidative stress. For major depressive disorder, this association was strongest and independent of sociodemographic, cardiometabolic factors, and somatic morbidities.","Hagen, Julia M; Sutterland, Arjen L; da Fonseca Pereira de Sousa, Paulo A L; Schirmbeck, Frederike; Cohn, Danny M; Lok, Anja; Tan, Hanno L; Zwinderman, Aeilko H; de Haan, Lieuwe",Journal of affective disorders,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.06.040; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32734913/,415

METHODS To investigate the difference of vaccination status between different genotypes in the circulating B. pertussis after 10 years of acellular pertussis vaccine (aPV) used in China. The nasopharyngeal swabs and isolates of B. pertussis from these patients were used to perform genotyping of antigen genes. We use antibiotic susceptibility test against erythromycin and sequencing methods for site 2047 of 23S rRNA to determine the resistance status. RESULTS The ptxP1 allele with erythromycin resistant (ER) B. pertussis infection (total of 449 subjects) consisted of 84.70 to 96.70% from 2012 to 2016 in this study. Vaccinated with co-purified aPV was found in 133(133/403,33.0%), 1(1/9,11.1%) and 2(2/21,9.5%) in ptxP1/fhaB3-ER, ptxP1/fhaB2-ES and ptxP3/fhaB2-ES B. pertussis infected children each, which showed a significant difference (χ2 = 6.87, P = 0.032). CONCLUSIONS The ptxP3-ES B. pertussis was rare while the ptxP1-ER B. pertussis was steadily increased in Xi'an, China from 2012 to 2016, where co-purified aPV was prevalent used. This pose a hypothesis that the co-purified aPV might protect against ptxP3 strains more efficient, which generated a rare chance for ptxP3 strains to be under the antibiotic pressure and further developed to be erythromycin resistance. A further cohort study and the mechanisms of the additional antigen proteins of co-purified aPV protected against B. pertussis should be consideration.","Wang, Zengguo; Luan, Yang; Du, Quanli; Shu, Chang; Peng, Xiaokang; Wei, Huijing; Hou, Tiejun; Liu, Ying; Liu, Xiaoguai; Li, Yarong",BMC infectious diseases,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-020-05332-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32814558/,415

Since 2005 this virus has been responsible for an epidemic outbreak of unprecedented magnitude. By analogy with other alphaviruses, it is thought that cellular proteases are able to process the viral precursor protein E3E2 to produce the receptor-binding E2 protein that associates as a heterodimer with E1. Destabilization of the heterodimer by exposure to low pH allows viral fusion and infection. We show that among a large panel of proprotein convertases, membranous furin but also PC5B can process E3E2 from African CHIKV strains at the HRQRR(64) / ST site, whereas a CHIKV strain of Asian origin is cleaved at RRQRR(64) / SI by membranous and soluble furin, PC5A, PC5B, and PACE4 but not by PC7 or SKI-1. Using fluorogenic model peptides and recombinant convertases, we observed that the Asian strain E3E2 model peptide is cleaved most efficiently by furin and PC5A. This cleavage was also observed in CHIKV-infected cells and could be blocked by furin inhibitor decanoyl-RVKR-chloromethyl ketone. This inhibitor was compared with chloroquine for its ability to inhibit CHIKV spreading in myoblast cell cultures, a cell-type previously described as a natural target of this virus. Our results demonstrate the role of furin-like proteases in the processing of CHIKV particles and point out new approaches to inhibit this infection.","Ozden, Simona; Lucas-Hourani, Marianne; Ceccaldi, Pierre-Emmanuel; Basak, Ajoy; Valentine, Menogh; Benjannet, Suzanne; Hamelin, Josée; Jacob, Yves; Mamchaoui, Kamel; Mouly, Vincent; Desprès, Philippe; Gessain, Antoine; Butler-Browne, Gillian; Chrétien, Michel; Tangy, Frédéric; Vidalain, Pierre-Olivier; Seidah, Nabil G",The Journal of biological chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.m802444200; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18559340/,415

Bats are reservoirs for an increasing number of emerging zoonotic viruses, such as henipaviruses and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). However, little is known of T. gondii infection in bats. The objective of the present study was to determine the seroprevalence of T. gondii infection in bats in China. A total of 217 serum samples from 5 species of bats were collected between April, 2010, and August, 2011, from 4 provinces in China. Antibodies to T. gondii were determined using the modified agglutination test (MAT, 1:25 or higher). Antibodies to T. gondii were found in 26.5% (18/68) Megaderma lyra, 13.6% (12/88) Rousettus leschenaulti, 13.6% (3/22) Cynopterus sphinx, 20% (4/20) Vespertilio superaus, and 15.8% (3/19) Pipistrellus javanicus. Antibody titers ranged from 1:25 to 1:400, with titers of 1:200 detected in 4 of the 5 bat species.

To better understand care coordination of MCBS, this review elucidated concerns of female MBCS about their preparation for post-treatment survivorship care, the preferred practices for the delivery of a SCP, and the associated content to improve post-treatment survivorship care understanding. METHODS A systematic search of articles from PubMed, Ovid-Medline, CINAHL databases, and bibliographic reviews included manuscripts using keywords for racial/ethnic minority groups and breast cancer survivorship care coordination terms. Salient themes and article quality were analyzed from the extracted data. RESULTS Fourteen included studies represented 5,854 participants and over 12 racial/ethnic groups. The following themes of post-treatment MBCS were identified from the review: (1) uncertainty about post-treatment survivorship care management is a consequence of sub-optimal patient-provider communication; (2) access to SCPs and related materials are desired, but sporadic; and (3) advancements to the delivery and presentation of SCPs and related materials are desired. CONCLUSIONS Representation of only 14 studies indicates that the MBCSs' perspective post-treatment survivorship care is underrepresented in the literature. Themes from this review support access to, and implementation of, culturally tailored SCP for MBCS. There was multi-ethnic acceptance of SCPs as a tool to help improve care coordination. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS These findings highlight the importance of general education about post-treatment survivorship, post-treatment survivorship needs identification, and the elucidation of gaps in effective SCP delivery among MBCS.","Lewis-Thames, Marquita W; Strayhorn, Shaila M; Molina, Yamilé; Nolan, Timiya S",Journal of cancer survivorship : research and practice,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11764-020-00894-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32514908/,415

Different approaches have been developed during the last decades, with a strong tendency towards tension-free techniques. The laparoscopic approach offers advantages in terms of less postoperative pain and faster recovery with a low incidence in recurrence. In the last few years, single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) has been introduced to further improve surgical outcome and cosmetic results. For SILS inguinal hernia repair, there is little data available so far, but both totally extraperitoneal hernia repair and transabdominal preperitoneal hernia repair have been succesfully performed without complications in a limited number of patients.

Interventional cardiology is no longer limited to the treatment of coronary artery disease but allows also treatment of valvular disease, stroke prevention, hypertension, etc. One of the most important new treatment options is the percutaneous treatment for aortic valve stenosis (transcatheter aortic valve implantation), since aortic valve disease is a rather common problem in elderly patients, with many of them at high risk for surgery. Similarly, mitral regurgitation is often associated with comorbidities which make surgery high risk. The MitraClip is a promising percutaneous alternative to surgical valve repair or replacement. Other procedures discussed in this review are the percutaneous left atrial appendage closure as a non-pharmacologic therapy to prevent strokes, and renal denervation for resistant hypertension.

METHODS Fifteen novice doctors who did not have sufficient experience in endotracheal intubation (ETI) and consented to participate in this study were included. We used AirSim and AMT (Airway management Trainer) manikins. First, an experienced anesthesiologist instructed the trainees on using the 3 instruments for a few minutes. Then, after familiarizing themselves with each device for 10 minutes, the participants attempted ETI on the 2 manikins with the 3 devices used in random order. Intubations with each device were practiced and performed for 3 successive days. We assessed the percentage of glottic opening (POGO) score, successful intubation rate and tracheal intubation time for each participant, with each device, and on each day. RESULTS In the first manikin, AirSim, POGO scores in the McG and AWS groups were significantly higher than those in the Mac group on all 3 days (P < .0001). The number of intubation failures in the Mac group decreased from 2 cases on day 1, to 1 case on day 2 and zero cases on day 3. There were no failures in the McG and AWS groups on any of the days. With the second manikin, AMT, POGO scores in the Mac group were significantly lower than those in the McG and AWS groups on all 3 days. There were no intubation failures in the AWS group on all 3 days. In the Mac group, the number of intubation failures decreased from 3 on day 1, to 2 on day 2 and zero failures on day 3. In the McG group, there were only 3 failures on day 1. CONCLUSION The 2 types of indirect video-laryngoscopes (McGRATH and AirwayScope) were demonstrated to be suitable instruments for novice doctors to achieve higher POGO scores in a 3-day intensive ETI training.","Murakami, Yuryo; Ueki, Ryusuke; Niki, Miyuki; Hirose, Munetaka; Shimode, Noriko",Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000023886; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33530183/,415

Kisspeptin neurons in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (KNDy neurons) are considered the main regulator of GnRH output. GnRH and KNDy neurons are surrounded by astrocytes, which can modulate neuronal activity and communicate over distances. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), synthesized primarily by astrocytes, increases GnRH neuron activity and downstream pituitary release of luteinizing hormone (LH). We hypothesized GFAP-expressing astrocytes play a role regulating GnRH and/or KNDy neuron activity and LH release. We used adenoassociated viruses to target designer receptor exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) to GFAP-expressing cells to activate Gq or Gi-mediated signaling. Activating Gq signaling in the preoptic area, near GnRH neurons, but not in the arcuate, increases LH release in vivo and GnRH firing in vitro via a mechanism in part dependent upon PGE2. These data suggest astrocytes can activate GnRH/LH release in a manner independent of KNDy neurons.","Vanacker, Charlotte; Defazio, Richard Anthony; Sykes, Charlene M; Moenter, Suzanne M",eLife,https://doi.org/10.7554/elife.68205; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34292152/,415

Remifentanil has been generally used to prevent cough due to its unique pharmacodynamics. However, there was no study that compared optimal remifentanil effect-site concentration (Ce) to prevent emergence cough according to the type of inhalational agent in elderly female patients. Thus, we investigated the Ce of remifentanil for preventing cough during emergence from sevoflurane and desflurane anesthesia in elderly female patients. Methods Forty-three female patients between 60 and 75 years of age undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy were randomly allocated to sevoflurane group (n=22) or desflurane group (n=21). The optimal remifentanil Ce using target-controlled infusion for 50% of patients (EC50) and 95% of patients (EC95) was assessed by Dixon's up-and-down method or isotonic regression method with a bootstrapping approach. Results By Dixon's up-and-down method, the EC50 of remifentanil in sevoflurane group (2.08±0.47 ng/mL) was comparable with that in desflurane group (2.25±0.40 ng/mL) (P=0.385). The EC50 (83% CIs) and EC95 (95% CIs) by isotonic regression also did not show significant difference between two groups [2.06 (1.45-2.23) and 2.46 (2.35-2.48) ng/mL in sevoflurane group and 2.14 (1.45-2.56) and 2.88 (2.47-2.98) ng/mL in desflurane group, respectively]. Conclusion There was no difference in the remifentanil Ce to prevent emergence cough between sevoflurane and desflurane anesthesia. Therefore, the clinicians may not need to adjust the remifentanil Ce to prevent emergence cough according to inhalational agents in elderly female patients.","Kim, Ha Yeon; Moon, Yeo Rae; Seok, Suhyun; Kim, Bora; Kim, Ji Eun; Lee, Sook Young",Clinical interventions in aging,https://doi.org/10.2147/cia.s174626; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30271132/,415

This study evaluates the effect of the shelter-in-place (SIP) mandate on glycemic metrics in youth with type 1 diabetes (T1D) using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in Northern California, United States. METHODS CGM and insulin pump metrics in youth 3-21 years old with T1D at an academic pediatric diabetes center were analyzed retrospectively. Data 2-4 months before (distant pre-SIP), 1 month before (immediate pre-SIP), 1 month after (immediate post-SIP), and 2-4 months after (distant post-SIP) the SIP mandate were compared using paired t-tests, linear regression, and longitudinal analysis using a mixed effects model. RESULTS Participants (n=85) had reduced mean glucose (-10.3 ± 4.4 mg/dl, p = 0.009), standard deviation (SD) (-5.0 ± 1.3 mg/dl, p=0.003), glucose management indicator (GMI) (-0.2 ± 0.03%, p=0.004) and time above range (TAR) > 250 mg/dl (-3.5 ± 1.7%, p = 0.01), and increased time in range (TIR) (+4.7 ± 1.7%, p = 0.0025) between the distant pre-SIP and distant post-SIP periods. Relationships were maintained using a mixed effects model, when controlling for other demographic variables. There was improvement in SD, TAR 180-250 mg/dl, and TIR for participants with private insurance, but changes in the opposite direction for participants with public insurance. CONCLUSIONS Improvement in CGM metrics in youth with T1D during the COVID-19 pandemic suggests that diabetes management can be maintained in the face of sudden changes to daily living.

The Outcomes for Pressure Ulcer Trials (OUTPUTs) project aims to improve the quality of evidence on pressure ulcer prevention trials by developing a COS. OBJECTIVES As an initial step in the COS process we aimed to identify and classify outcomes as well as concepts that represent potential outcomes for future trials that have been reported in pressure ulcer prevention research. METHODS A review was conducted in twelve major databases covering the literature indexed until 2016. Outcomes and relevant concepts reported in primary studies and/or reviews on pressure ulcer prevention in adult patients were extracted as presented in the articles, and afterwards inductively grouped into outcome domains. The domains were then categorized according to the outcome domain taxonomy recently proposed by the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials Group. RESULTS 332 studies were included and 68 outcome domains were identified, covering multiple aspects of pressure ulcer prevention. Pressure ulcer occurrence was reported in 71% of all included studies representing the most frequent outcome, followed by costs (22% of all studies), and acceptability of intervention and comfort (18% of all studies). CONCLUSION A plethora of different outcomes is applied in pressure ulcer prevention research and substantial variations in definitions and reporting of similar outcomes were observed. A COS for pressure ulcer prevention trials is needed to overcome the non-comparability of outcomes.","Lechner, A; Kottner, J; Coleman, S; Muir, D; Beeckman, D; Chaboyer, W; Cuddigan, J; Moore, Z; Rutherford, C; Schmitt, J; Nixon, J; Balzer, K",The British journal of dermatology,https://doi.org/10.1111/bjd.19304; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32510579/,415

With regard to previously untreated patients with follicular lymphoma (FL), we sought to establish the prognostic significance of Trp catabolism in this disease. Serum Trp and Kyn levels in 110 patients with FL were quantified, and their relationship to different clinical parameters studied. IDO expression in the lymph nodes of affected patients was studied. Study participants included 54 males and 56 females (age range 39-86, median 62 years), showing a 5-year overall survival (OS) rate of 78.5%. Patients with a high Kyn level (5-year OS, 65.0% versus 81.7%; P = 0.026), high Kyn/Trp ratio (71.1% versus 81.7%; P = 0.002), and low hemoglobin (Hb) level (< 12.0 g/dL; P = 0.001; a component of FL international prognostic indexes) demonstrated a significantly shorter OS. Multivariate analysis included the following 10 variables: age, sex, serum β2-microglobulin, Hb, longest diameter of the largest involved node, Ann Arbor stage, serum lactate dehydrogenase, histologic grading, B symptoms, and serum Kyn/Trp ratio; a lower Hb level and a high Kyn/Trp ratio (HR, 3.239; 95% CI, 1.296-8.096) led to a significantly inferior OS. In the microenvironment, some CD11c-positive myeloid dendritic cells but not FL tumor cells were found to produce IDO.

Rats with myocardial infarction were then exposed to either IH or normoxia for up to 12 weeks. Cardiac remodeling and function were analyzed by Sirius red and wheat germ agglutinin staining, ultrasonography, and cardiac catheterization. Sympathetic activity was evaluated by spectral analysis of blood pressure variability. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1α activation and burden of endoplasmic reticulum stress were characterized by Western blots. Long-term IH exposure precipitated cardiac remodeling (hypertrophy and interstitial fibrosis) and contractile dysfunction during the time course evolution of ischemic cardiomyopathy in rodents. Among associated mechanisms, we identified the early occurrence and persistence of sympathetic activation, associated with sustained hypoxia-inducible factor-1α expression and a delayed pro-apoptotic endoplasmic reticulum stress. CONCLUSIONS Our data provide the demonstration of the deleterious impact of IH on post-myocardial infarction remodeling and contractile dysfunction. Further studies are needed to evaluate whether targeting sympathetic nervous system or HIF-1 overactivities could limit these effects and improve management of coexisting ischemic cardiomyopathy and sleep-disordered breathing.","Bourdier, Guillaume; Détrait, Maximin; Bouyon, Sophie; Lemarié, Emeline; Brasseur, Sandrine; Doutreleau, Stéphane; Pépin, Jean-Louis; Godin-Ribuot, Diane; Belaidi, Elise; Arnaud, Claire",Journal of the American Heart Association,https://doi.org/10.1161/jaha.120.016369; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32805159/,415

Coronavirus was detected in 31 (3.5%) of the tested birds, with detection rates of 3.5% in Anseriformes and 2.3% in Charadriiformes and as high as 17.6% in Galliformes. From the 31 positive samples, only 10 gave positive results in molecular tests aimed at various IBV genome fragments: five samples were positive for the RdRp gene, four for gene 3, eight for gene N and eight for the 3'-untranslated region fragment. All analysed genome fragments of the coronavirus strains shared different evolutionary branches, resulting in a different phylogenetic tree topology. Most detected fragment genes seem to be IBV-like genes of the most frequently detected lineages of IBV in this geographical region (i.e. Massachusetts, 793B and QX). Two waves of coronavirus infections were identified: one in spring (April and May) and another in late autumn (October to December).

The statement is framed taking into consideration existing publications and own research experience. The main content of this statement is that the combination of one β-lactam and a macrolide should be the first treatment of choice for patients with severe bacterial CAP. Severity is assessed as scoring 2 or more points on the CURB65 scoring system of severity or as pneumonia severity index III to V or C-reactive protein more than 150 mg/l; the suggested macrolide is either azithromycin or clarithromycin.

Several vulnerability factors may play a role in individuals' psychological reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic. Such factors include pathological personality traits which have been shown to contribute to the development of anxiety-related conditions. Consequently, the present study investigated the relationships between DSM-5 pathological personality domains and COVID-19-related anxiety symptoms. Using an online data portal, the relationships between DSM-5 pathological personality domains and COVID-19-related anxiety symptoms among a mixed university student and community sample (N = 612) were studied. The results showed that there was a positive and significant relationship between all DSM-5 pathological personality domains and COVID-19-related anxiety. The results of multiple linear regression analysis showed that DSM-5 pathological personality domains explained 21% of COVID-19-related anxiety variance. Based on standardized coefficients, the Personality Inventory for DSM-5 (PID-5) negative affect domain had the main role in COVID-19-related anxiety. The findings suggest that pathological personality domains can be predictors in the symptoms of anxiety in a viral outbreak. The novel findings add to the literature on individual differences in domains of personality in response to pandemic situations.

137753,"Variation in mortality of HIV/SARS-CoV-2 co-infected patients in the Bronx, New York City.",2020-07-29,"Reverse genetic systems are a critical tool for studying viruses and identifying countermeasures. In response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we recently developed an infectious complementary DNA (cDNA) clone for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The reverse genetic system can be used to rapidly engineer viruses with desired mutations to study the virus in vitro and in vivo. Viruses can also be designed for live-attenuated vaccine development and engineered with reporter genes to facilitate serodiagnosis, vaccine evaluation and antiviral screening. Thus, the reverse genetic system of SARS-CoV-2 will be widely used for both basic and translational research. However, due to the large size of the coronavirus genome (~30,000 nucleotides long) and several toxic genomic elements, manipulation of the reverse genetic system of SARS-COV-2 is not a trivial task and requires sophisticated methods. Here, we describe the technical details of how to engineer recombinant SARS-CoV-2. Overall, the process includes six steps: (i) prepare seven plasmids containing SARS-CoV-2 cDNA fragment(s), (ii) prepare high-quality DNA fragments through restriction enzyme digestion of the seven plasmids, (iii) assemble the seven cDNA fragments into a genome-length cDNA, (iv) in vitro transcribe RNA from the genome-length cDNA, (iv) electroporate the genome-length RNA into cells to recover recombinant viruses and (vi) characterize the rescued viruses. This protocol will enable researchers from different research backgrounds to master the use of the reverse genetic system and, consequently, accelerate COVID-19 research.","Xie, Xuping; Lokugamage, Kumari G; Zhang, Xianwen; Vu, Michelle N; Muruato, Antonio E; Menachery, Vineet D; Shi, Pei-Yong",Nature protocols,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41596-021-00491-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33514944/,415

Here, we expand our investigation of the immunogenic properties of these bivalent vaccines in mice. Both live and killed vaccines induced primary EBOV GP-specific T-cells and a robust recall response as measured by interferon-γ ELISPOT assay. In addition to cellular immunity, an effective filovirus vaccine will likely require a multivalent humoral immune response against multiple virus species. As a proof-of-principle experiment, we demonstrated that inactivated RV-GP could be formulated with another inactivated RABV vaccine expressing the nontoxic fragment of botulinum neurotoxin A heavy chain (HC50) without a reduction in immunity to each component. Finally, we demonstrated that humoral immunity to GP could be induced by immunization of mice with inactivated RV-GP in the presence of pre-existing immunity to RABV. The ability of these novel vaccines to induce strong humoral and cellular immunity indicates that they should be further evaluated in additional animal models of infection.","Papaneri, Amy B; Wirblich, Christoph; Cooper, Kurt; Jahrling, Peter B; Schnell, Matthias J; Blaney, Joseph E",Vaccine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2012.07.073; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22884661/,415

Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs) have been postulated to play a key role in treating ovarian ageing. METHODS We used macaque ovarian ageing models to observe the structural and functional changes after juvenile BMMSC treatment. Moreover, RNA-seq was used to analyse the ovarian transcriptional expression profile and key pathways through which BMMSCs reverse ovarian ageing. RESULTS In the elderly macaque models, the ovaries were atrophied, the regulation ability of sex hormones was reduced, the ovarian structure was destroyed, and only local atretic follicles were observed, in contrast with young rhesus monkeys. Intravenous infusion of BMMSCs in elderly macaques increased ovarian volume, strengthened the regulation ability of sex hormones, reduced the degree of pulmonary fibrosis, inhibited apoptosis, increased density of blood vessels, and promoted follicular regeneration. In addition, the ovarian expression characteristics of ageing-related genes of the elderly treatment group reverted to that of the young control group, 1258 genes that were differentially expressed, among which 415 genes upregulated with age were downregulated, 843 genes downregulated with age were upregulated after BMMSC treatment, and the top 20 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network were significantly enriched in oocyte meiosis and progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation pathways. CONCLUSION The BMMSCs derived from juvenile macaques can reverse ovarian ageing in elderly macaques.","Tian, Chuan; He, Jie; An, Yuanyuan; Yang, Zailing; Yan, Donghai; Pan, Hang; Lv, Guanke; Li, Ye; Wang, Yanying; Yang, Yukun; Zhu, Gaohong; He, Zhixu; Zhu, Xiangqing; Pan, Xinghua",Stem cell research & therapy,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13287-021-02486-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34407863/,415

This study investigated the potential of cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) to improve the intestinal permeation and absorption of low-permeable low-molecular-weight (low-MW) drugs. METHODS The in vitro epithelial permeation of six different drugs (metformin, risedronate, zanamivir, methotrexate [MTX], tacrolimus, and vincristine [VCR]) across Caco-2 cell monolayers was examined in the presence and absence of L- or D-penetratin, and the correlation between permeation enhancement efficiency and the properties of tested drugs was analyzed. In addition, a rat closed ileal loop absorption study was conducted to determine the in vivo effects of penetratin. RESULTS MTX and VCR efficiently permeated Caco-2 monolayers in the presence of L- and D-penetratin, suggesting that CPPs enhanced the epithelial permeation of drugs with relatively high molecular weight and resultant limited intrinsic permeability. The in vivo rat closed ileal loop absorption study revealed the stimulatory effect of L- and D-penetratin on the intestinal absorption of MTX and VCR.

Despite effective control by antiretroviral therapy (ART), a significant subgroup of people living with HIV (PLHIV) fails to achieve complete immune reconstitution, deemed as immune non-responders (INRs). The mechanisms underlying incomplete CD4 T cell recovery in PLHIV remain unclear. In this study, CD4 T cells from PLHIV were phenotyped and functionally characterized, focusing on their mitochondrial functions. The results show that while total CD4 T cells are diminished, cycling cells are expanded in PLHIV, especially in INRs. HIV-INR CD4 T cells are more activated, displaying exhausted and senescent phenotypes with compromised mitochondrial functions. Transcriptional profiling and flow cytometry analysis showed remarkable repression of mitochondrial transcription factor A (mtTFA) in CD4 T cells from PLHIV, leading to abnormal mitochondrial and T cell homeostasis. These results demonstrate a sequential cellular paradigm of T cell over-activation, proliferation, exhaustion, senescence, apoptosis, and depletion, which correlates with compromised mitochondrial functions. Therefore, reconstituting the mtTFA pathway may provide an adjunctive immunological approach to revitalizing CD4 T cells in ART-treated PLHIV, especially in INRs.","Zhao, Juan; Schank, Madison; Wang, Ling; Li, Zhengke; Nguyen, Lam Nhat; Dang, Xindi; Cao, Dechao; Khanal, Sushant; Nguyen, Lam Ngoc Thao; Thakuri, Bal Krishna Chand; Ogbu, Stella C; Lu, Zeyuan; Wu, Xiao Y; Morrison, Zheng D; Gazzar, Mohamed El; Liu, Ying; Zhang, Jinyu; Ning, Shunbin; Moorman, Jonathan P; Yao, Zhi Q",Frontiers in immunology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.658420; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34017335/,415

METHODS We gauged this hypothesis by analysing the nasal swab of infants with either bronchiolitis or a non-infectious disease admitted to the Ospedale Maggiore, Milan (one of the first epicentres of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Europe) from November 2019. RESULTS The SARS-CoV-2 RNA was never detected in 218 infants with bronchiolitis (95 females, median age 4.9 months) and 49 infants (22 females, median age 5.6 months) with a non-infectious disease between November 2019 and February 2020. On the contrary, two infants hospitalised for bronchiolitis between March and April 2020 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.

METHODOLOGY The root filling material (gutta-percha) removed from 42 teeth undergoing root canal treatment with periapical radiolucency was analysed by molecular genetics techniques. Real-Time Pan-PCRs were conducted for the diagnosis of predominant bacteria (targeting 16S rDNA) and fungi (targeting ITS1-2 region). Identification of microorganisms was performed by Sanger sequencing of the PCR products and BLAST analysis. Additionally, subgingival plaque samples were collected and cultured to review the microbial flora's composition. The McNemar test and the repeated measures ANOVA were used for statistical analyses (significance level was set at p<0.05). RESULTS Overall, 42/42 plaque samples had bacterial growth, whereas 32/42 gutta-percha samples had bacterial growth with a dominance of Streptococcus spp. (12/42) and Enterococcus faecalis (9/42). The mean number of bacterial taxa per gutta-percha sample was 1.6 cultivatable taxa, significantly lower than in the plaque sample with 6 taxa/sample (p<0.001). Fungus-specific cultures were negative for gutta-percha samples and only one plaque sample had growth of a fungus. In total, 36/42 plaque samples were positive in bacterial Pan-PCRs. In bacterial Pan-PCRs of 31/42 gutta-percha samples dominant microorganisms were identified including Streptococcus spp. (5/42) and E. faecalis (4/42). Moreover, in 7/42 gutta-percha samples DNA of bacteria which are difficult-to-cultivate in microbiology routine culture (Acinetobacter, Pyramidobacter, Bacteroidetes, Synergistes, Atopobium, Pseudoramibacter) were found. DNA of Candida spp. was detected in 5/42 root canals by fungal Pan-PCR (1/5) and genus-specific Candida-PCR (5/5). CONCLUSIONS Pan-PCR assays remain appropriate as a broad-range approach for the detection of a dominant pathogen in gutta-percha samples which have less diverse microbial composition. The molecular genetic Pan-PCR approach has the advantage of detecting microorganisms that are as-yet-uncultivable or difficult-to-cultivate and should be therefore complementary to conventional microbiological diagnostics.","Al-Sakati, H; Kowollik, S; Gabris, S; Balasiu, A; Ommerborn, M; Pfeffer, K; Henrich, B; H-M Raab, W",International endodontic journal,https://doi.org/10.1111/iej.13404; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32894604/,415

The initial search yielded 4593 articles with 15 accepted for review. Based on this review, there is a suggestion that negative emotions, in particular, perceived stress, may be predictive of emotional eating among non-Hispanic Black women. Results from the only two longitudinal studies identified by the review indicate that stress influences emotional eating, and emotional eating predicts weight gain over time. Findings from this review highlight the need for more studies that examine various negative emotions that may lead to emotional eating and weight gain among non-Hispanic Black women. Findings from this review also highlight the need for more rigorous studies to differentiate the effects of emotional eating from that of the physiologic (ie, activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis) responses to stress and its impact on high-risk groups.","Pickett, Stephanie; Burchenal, Clare A; Haber, Leora; Batten, Kendra; Phillips, Erica",Obesity reviews : an official journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity,https://doi.org/10.1111/obr.13010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32067355/,415

However, very little is known about either the quality of the adaptive immune response or the viral Ag targets that will be necessary to prevent the spread of the infection. In this study, we generated recombinant Vaccinia virus expressing the full-length spike protein from SARS-CoV-2 (VacV-S) to evaluate the cellular and humoral immune response mounted against this viral Ag in mice. Both CD8+ and CD4+ T cells specific to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein underwent robust expansion, contraction, and persisted for at least 40 d following a single immunization with VacV-S. Vaccination also caused the rapid emergence of spike-specific IgG-neutralizing Abs. Interestingly, both the cellular and humoral immune responses strongly targeted the S1 domain of spike following VacV-S immunization. Notably, immunization with VacV-expressing spike conjugated to the MHC class II invariant chain, a strategy previously reported by us and others to enhance the immunogenicity of antigenic peptides, did not promote stronger spike-specific T cell or Ab responses in vivo.

This study aimed to assess the feasibility and safety of the laparoscopic transhiatal approach for Siewert type II AEG, and compare the short-term outcomes of LS versus OS for Siewert type II AEG. METHODS We retrospectively analyzed 87 consecutive patients with Siewert type II AEG who underwent curative surgery from January 2008 to November 2016. Surgery-related short-term variables were analyzed in LS versus OS. RESULTS Forty-five patients underwent LS, and 42 underwent OS. Compared with OS, LS was associated with significantly less intraoperative blood loss (11 vs. 408 ml, p < 0.001) and extended operation time (256 vs. 226 min, p = 0.001). There was no significant difference between LS and OS in postoperative hospitalization duration (9 vs. 10 days, p = 0.193) or rate of surgical morbidity (≥grade 3) for complications such as anastomotic leakage (4.4 vs. 4.8%, p = 1.000), or pancreatic leakage (4.4 vs. 9.5%, p = 0.423), and there were no pulmonary-associated complications in either group. There was no difference between groups in total number of harvested lymph nodes (24 vs. 29, p = 0.502), but the number of harvested mediastinum LNs was larger in LS (2 vs. 1, p = 0.002). There was no difference between groups in the length of the proximal margin (9 vs. 10 mm, p = 0.246), and the margins were negative in all cases in both groups. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic transhiatal resection for Siewert type II AEG is technically challenging, but appears feasible and safe in technical or short-term oncological aspects when performed by an experienced surgical team. A large-scale prospective study is needed to evaluate long-term outcomes.","Sugita, Shizuki; Kinoshita, Takahiro; Kaito, Akio; Watanabe, Masahiro; Sunagawa, Hideki",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-017-5687-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28656339/,415
161882,Anti-spike IgG causes severe acute lung injury by skewing macrophage responses during acute SARS-CoV infection.,2019,"Reports an error in ""Predicting negative affect variability and spontaneous emotion regulation: Can working memory span tasks estimate emotion regulatory capacity"" by Karin G. Coifman, Michael J. Kane, Melissa Bishop, Lindsey M. Matt, K. Maria Nylocks and Pallavi Aurora (Emotion, Advanced Online Publication, Mar 18, 2019, np). In the article, in the Results and Discussion sections for Study 2 and in Table 6, it was stated that RSPAN scores predicted spontaneous down-regulation of negative affect from one diary signal to the next. However, because RSPAN scores are a person-level variable, it is an error to describe the results in that way. RSPAN scores cannot predict variability within person (i.e., signal to signal) but rather predict variability between person (i.e., person to person). Hence, a corrected interpretation would be to state that the RSPAN predicted levels of negative affect across the experience sampling diary, even when considering trait and state levels of affect and variability in daily stress. The analysis remains correct and the findings remain meaningful. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2019-14235-001.) We tested the association of 2 versions of the Reading Span Task of working memory capacity, a conventional neutral version (RSPAN-N) and an adapted task with incidental negative content (RSPAN-E), for predicting objective indicators (behavioral displays; autonomic activation) of negative emotion regulation during a laboratory provocation, as well as reported negative emotion in daily life experience sampling. Across 2 samples, both tasks demonstrated utility as estimates of spontaneous negative emotion regulation capacity, predicting down-regulation of negative emotion in daily life and during a lab challenge. In addition, scores from both tasks appear to be independent of self-reported distress, a confound often present in studies of emotion regulation. There was some incremental evidence that the RSPAN-E may have advantages over the RSPAN-N for predicting some indices of emotion processing. Together these findings provide further evidence for the role of working memory (among other executive-control abilities) in emotion regulatory processing and suggest that RSPAN tasks may have considerable potential as tools in research on emotion processing and emotion regulation in psychological health and adjustment.

PATIENTS AND METHODS The transperitoneal surgical technique included division of the parenchyma with a sealing device (LigaSure™; Covidien, Mansfield, MA) and amputation of the ureter as low as possible. A follow-up study was performed. Patients' records were analyzed retrospectively for operative details and postoperative complications. Long-term outcome was assessed during follow-up visits and a final telephone interview. Outcome was compared between two groups: Group 1 (G1), age at surgery<12 months; Group 2 (G2), age at surgery >12 months. RESULTS Between July 2004 and September 2012, in total, 22 laparoscopic heminephrectomies (20 upper poles and 2 lower poles) were performed in 20 patients (G1, 12 cases; G2, 10 cases). A mean (range) age at surgery was 7.1 (3-11) months in G1 and 49.4 (15-128) months in G2. Mean (range) operative time was 152 (81-220) min in G1 and 197 (90-265) min in G2 (P=.06). All procedures were completed laparoscopically. Major postoperative complication was one urinoma in G1, which was surgically revised. Mean hospital stay was 3.6 days (G1, 4.0 days; G2, 3.1 days). During long-term follow-up (median, 5.2 years) febrile urinary tract infections occurred to the same extent in both groups (G1, 1/12; G2, 2/10; P=.57). CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic transperitoneal heminephrectomy for duplex kidneys is safe and feasible even in small infants.

However, data regarding the clinical impact of treatment with TCZ in patients with COVID-19 are limited. This study was conducted to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of TCZ as an adjunct therapy for the treatment of severe COVID-19 infections. This is a retrospective, observational chart review of confirmed COVID-19 patients who received TCZ, along with other COVID-19 therapies. The outcomes of interest included changes in vital signs such as temperatures and laboratory biomarkers, the duration of mechanical ventilation, adverse events possibly associated with TCZ, and intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital lengths of stay. This study included 38 patients with an average age of 63 years (IQR: 48-70). The average dose of TCZ given was 519 ± 61 mg. The median values of C-reactive protein (CRP) significantly decreased following TCZ administration (189.9 vs. 54.8 mg/L, p = 0.003). Nineteen (73 %) of all febrile patients before the initiation of TCZ became fever free on the fourth day of TCZ treatment. Following TCZ treatment, 11 patients developed infections due to multidrug-resistant bacteria, and elevated liver transaminases were observed in 6 patients. The preliminary findings of this study suggested TCZ appeared to ameliorate COVID-19-related cytokine storm syndrome. However, large randomized controlled trials are needed to investigate whether treatment with TCZ is associated with better outcomes in COVID-19. This article is protected by copyright.

More than a decade after the global financial crisis, the world is struggling with the health and economic effects of a profound new crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. It also affected the Indonesian stock market in almost every sector. Besides, the performance of the stock market of financial industries has also been significantly affected, particularly four state-owned banks. This study aimed to analyze the potential loss from investing in the stock market of such government banks for the next 15 days by revisiting value at risk (VaR) as a tool for measuring the maximum loss. The findings suggest that Autoregressive AR (1)-GARCH (1) is a good fit for the determination of the mean and variance model, which were used to calculate the VaR of each bank. VaR measurement for all banks shows a negative sign that indicates the maximum loss of investors from holding any of those banks' stocks for a projected time horizon. Risk measurement will be one of the things that will be considered by investors when investing in the financial market. The results of the study suggest that investors who have funds in state-owned banks should reconsider their investments.","Ahadiat, A.; Kesumah, F.

For the time being, medical specialists in the operating room (OR) or Intensive Care Units (ICU) face special responsibilities when the procedures involve a patient with an infectious disease (e.g., COVID-19) that can cause several complications. The added workload of the anesthesiologist can be diminished by the context-aware pervasive assistance in the decision- making process for maintaining the optimal anesthesia and hemodynamics of the patient. A self-aware control system, with feedback from patient's monitored parameters and several surgical/ICU contextual data, is able to adapt his action accordingly, increasing treatment accuracy. The three main parts of general anesthesia (neuromuscular blockade, hypnosis and analgesia) and the hemodynamics (cardiac output, blood pressure) are perused from a global objective viewpoint, while intersecting the anesthesiologist's action upon his request. The integrative anesthesiologist-in-the-loop cyber-physical system (CPS) is emerging as an intelligent solution for hybrid control of anesthesia's depth, instead of total autonomous closed-loop controllers. This paper aims to create awareness throughout the anesthesiologists about the usefulness of integrating automation and data exchange in their clinical practice for providing increased attention to alarming situations. Moreover, it proposes an opening horizon for multi-disciplinary research.

However, early data from the COVID-19 pandemic has underscored that the burden of respiratory viruses actually reflect and magnify existing socioeconomic inequalities. We review the literature on socioeconomic and racial disparities in acute respiratory infection (ARI), as well as ARI-associated hospitalization and mortality. Our goal is to identify key principles of the relationship between socioeconomic inequality and ARI outcomes, as well as highlighting poorly understood areas that need to be addressed by research and policy in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. We find that there has been descriptive work in this area, but that there is a distinct lack of cohesive methodology in the literature exploring social determinants and ARI. We propose the fundamental cause theory is a useful framework for guiding future research of disparities in ARI and for the design of interventions to alleviate these disparities.","Moran, Elizabeth; Kubale, John; Noppert, Grace; Malosh, Ryan E; Zelner, Jon L",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.22.20069781v1?rss=1,415

In order to improve the quality of the manufactured parts and reduce costs, it is important to timely and accurately monitor the AM process during manufacturing. However, it remains a challenging task due to the high complexity of the AM process and the difficulty in processing the condition monitoring data. This paper proposes a deep learning-based process monitoring method for directed energy deposition in AM. The thermal images collected during manufacturing are used to identify the process condition, and a deep convolutional neural network model is proposed to build an end-to-end condition monitoring framework. Experiments on a real directed energy deposition dataset in AM are carried out for validation. The results suggest the proposed method offers a promising approach in process monitoring based on the industrial images. Furthermore, little prior knowledge on signal processing and AM is required, that largely facilitates the potential applications in the real industrial scenarios.","Li, Xiang; Siahpour, Shahin; Lee, Jay; Wang, Yachao; Shi, Jing",Procedia Manufacturing,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2351978920315456; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351978920315456,415

In the galactose-utilization (GAL) pathway of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, induction can be unimodal or bimodal depending on natural genetic variation and pre-induction conditions. Here, we find that this variation of modality is regulated by an interplay between two features of the pathway response, the fraction of cells that are in the induced subpopulation and their expression level. Combined, the variations in these features are sufficient to explain the observed effects of natural variation and pre-induction conditions on the modality of induction in both mechanistic and phenomenological models. Both natural variation and pre-induction conditions act by modulating the expression and function of the galactose sensor GAL3. The ability to alter modality may allow organisms to adapt their level of “bet hedging” to the conditions they experience, and thus help optimize fitness in complex, fluctuating natural environments.","Palme, Julius; Wang, Jue; Springer, Michael",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/131938,415

However, with response rates of 21.5-53.7% and a significant risk of peripheral neuropathy there is a need for more effective and better tolerated chemotherapy (CCT). Methods: This open label randomised (1:1) phase 2 trial compared 6 cycles of cabazitaxel (25 mg/m2 ) every 3 weeks, with weekly paclitaxel (80mg/m2 ) over 18 weeks as first line CCT. HER2 negative and performance status ≤1 patients were eligible. Patients on cabazitaxel received GCSF prophylaxis. Primary endpoint was Progression Free Survival (PFS) with 127 events required to detect a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.65 with 85% power. Secondary endpoints included objective response rate (ORR;RECIST 1.1), time to response (TTR), overall survival (OS), safety and tolerability and quality of life (QoL). Results: 158 patients were recruited from 14 UK hospitals (79 in each arm). Median age (range) was 56(34-81) in the cabazitaxel arm and 61(34-79) in the paclitaxel arm. 61% of patients were performance status 0. Median time on treatment was 15 weeks for both arms, but more patients on paclitaxel had a treatment delay (61% vs 39%) or dose reduction (37% vs 24%). Comparing cabazitaxel to paclitaxel after 146 PFS events, median PFS was 6.7 vs 5.8 months (HR 0.84;95%CI 0.60-1.18, P = 0.3). There was no difference in OS, median 19.3 vs 20.0 months (HR 0.94;95%CI 0.63-1.40, P = 0.7), ORR (42% vs 37%) or TTR (HR 1.09;95%CI 0.68- 1.74, P = 0.7). Grade ≥3 adverse events occurred in 42% of patients on cabazitaxel and 48% on paclitaxel. Diarrhoea, febrile neutropenia and nausea were the most common grade ≥3 events in the cabazitaxel arm with rates of 11%, 11% and 10% respectively compared to 1%, 1% and 0% in the paclitaxel arm. In the paclitaxel arm the top grade ≥3 events were lung infection and peripheral neuropathy, 6% and 5% respectively compared to 2.5% and 0% in the cabazitaxel arm. Peripheral neuropathy of any grade was reported by 55% of patients treated with paclitaxel vs 17% on cabazitaxel. Alopecia occurred in 41% of patients on paclitaxel compared to 27% on cabazitaxel. Adverse events leading to discontinuation were more frequent with paclitaxel (22%) than cabazitaxel (14%). Over the course of treatment, mean EQ5D single index utility score (+0.05;95%CI 0.004-0.09, P = 0.03) and visual analogue scale score (+7.7;95%CI 3.1-12.3, P = 0.001) were higher in the cabazitaxel arm compared to paclitaxel suggestive of better QoL on Cabazitaxel. Conclusions: 3 weekly cabazitaxel as first line chemotherapy in HER2 negative MBC does not significantly improve PFS compared to weekly paclitaxel, though it has a lower risk of peripheral neuropathy with better patient reported overall health outcomes. Cabazitaxel is safe and well tolerated for MBC and requires fewer hospital visits, an important consideration in the COVID pandemic and beyond.","Bahl, A.; Braybrooke, J.; Bravo, A.; Foulstone, E.; Ball, J.; Churn, M.; Dubey, S.; Spensley, S.; Bowen, R.; Waters, S.; Riddle, P.; Wheatley, D.; Stephens, P.; Mansi, J.; Bezecny, P.; Madhusudan, S.; Verrill, M.; Markham, A.; Pearson, S.; Wilson, W.",Journal of Clinical Oncology,https://doi.org/10.1200/jco.2021.39.15-suppl.1008,415

Mental disorder screening was performed by the Patient Health Questionnaire and PTSD Checklist for DSM-5.ResultsParticipants were 2003, 1504 of which (75%) completed the entire questionnaire (1157 females, 77%). Among the completers who have not had any mental disorder before (n=524, 35%), 263 (51.7%) met cut-off scores for psychiatric diagnoses on the self-report psychiatric screeners during the pandemic (i.e., Major Depressive Disorder, 11.3%, with death thoughts in approximately half of the cases;Panic Disorder, 1.1%;Generalized Anxiety Disorder, 13%.3, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, 13.2%, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, 7.3%;Alcohol Abuse, 5.5%). In line with this, 39% of completers complained of insomnia, while 12% and 10% started using anxiolytics and antidepressants, respectively.

The first category consists of 60 alleles, and the second category consists of 16 alleles. The main difference between the two categories is the insertion of an amino acid in the α2 region of DLA-88 alleles. To elucidate the structure of the first category, in this study, the crystal structure of pDLA-88*001:01 was determined for the first time. The 3D structure and topological characteristics of the ABG of pDLA-88*001:01 with a CDV peptide were analyzed. The viral presentation profile and the binding motif of viruses presented by pDLA-88*001:01 were determined. Most importantly, there were no amino acid insertions in the α2 region of the first category, which changed the conformation of the D pocket and the docking of the TCR. The results suggest obvious differences between the two categories. Because of the variation in the α2 region, pDLA-88*001:01 showed distinctive features in the two categories. Due to the peptide-binding motif of pDLA-88*001:01, more than 320 high-affinity viral peptides were predicted from dog H7N9, CPV, CMV, CMV, and CDV strains. The results reveal that there are two kinds of structural MHC-I systems in dogs that are responsible for CTL immunity against viral diseases. The results provide knowledge for designing viral epitope vaccines in canines. Importance DLA plays an important role in the acquired immunity of organism. In previous study, the pMHC-I structure of dog was analyzed with DLA-88 self-peptide. In this study, we screened several viral peptides which can bind to DLA-88 and resolved the structure of the DLA-88 complex binding the CDV peptide. This study enriches the study of canine MHC-I molecular-presenting polypeptide-activated TCR, which is of great significance for the study of canine cellular immunity and anti-viral vaccine development.","Sun, Yujiao; Ma, Lizhen; Li, Shen; Wang, Yawen; Xiao, Ruiqi; Yang, Junqi; Xia, Chun",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.04.425351,415

It is unclear which aspect of WM limitations affects event segmentation. In two separate experiments with multiple tasks, we estimated participants’ WM capacity and forgetting rate in a dynamic context and evaluated their relationship to event segmentation. The results across tasks show that individuals who reported more movie segments than others (fine-segmenters) have a faster decaying WM. A separate task assessing long-term memory retrieval reveals that the coarse-segmenters have better recognition of temporal order of events in contrast to the fine-segmenters who performed better at free recall. The findings show that event segmentation employs dissociable memory strategies and depends on how long information is retained in WM.","Jafarpour, Anna; Buffalo, Elizabeth A; Knight, Robert T; Collins, Anne GE",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/571380,415

METHODS Retrospective cohort that included all population ≥50 years with a laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in Tarragona, Spain, during 01/03/2020-30/06/2020. Treatment setting (outpatient/hospital/nursing-home), pre-existing comorbidities, signs/symptoms, clinical course, severity and lethality (death from any cause in-hospital or within the first 30-day after the diagnosis) were determined. Chi squared and Fisher's test were used to compare percentages. RESULTS Of the 536 overall cases (mean age: 74 years; 43.8% male), 150 (28%) were outpatient, 179 (33.4%) were hospitalised and 207 (38.6%) happened in nursing-home/social-health centres. The most prevalent symptoms were fever (57.9%), cough (49.8%), dyspnea (41.5%), general discomfort (36.2%), fatigue (24.4%), diarrhea (19.6%), myalgias (17.3%), headache (14.6%), confusion/lethargy (14.6%), thoracic pain (10%), anosmia (9.8%), disgeusia/ageusia (8.1%) and sore throat (7.7%).

193918,Non-Oncological PET/CT imaging during SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.,2020,"BACKGROUND The COVID-19 pandemic has worsened the pain and suffering of chronic pain patients due to stoppage of ""elective"" interventional pain management and office visits across the United States. The reopening of America and restarting of interventional techniques and elective surgical procedures has started. Unfortunately, with resurgence in some states, restrictions are once again being imposed. In addition, even during the Phase II and III of reopening, chronic pain patients and interventional pain physicians have faced difficulties because of the priority selection of elective surgical procedures.Chronic pain patients require high intensity care, specifically during a pandemic such as COVID-19. Consequently, it has become necessary to provide guidance for triaging interventional pain procedures, or related elective surgery restrictions during a pandemic. OBJECTIVES The aim of these guidelines is to provide education and guidance for physicians, healthcare administrators, the public and patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our goal is to restore the opportunity to receive appropriate care for our patients who may benefit from interventional techniques. METHODS The American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) has created the COVID-19 Task Force in order to provide guidance for triaging interventional pain procedures or related elective surgery restrictions to provide appropriate access to interventional pain management (IPM) procedures in par with other elective surgical procedures. In developing the guidance, trustworthy standards and appropriate disclosures of conflicts of interest were applied with a section of a panel of experts from various regions, specialties, types of practices (private practice, community hospital and academic institutes) and groups. The literature pertaining to all aspects of COVID-19, specifically related to epidemiology, risk factors, complications, morbidity and mortality, and literature related to risk mitigation and stratification was reviewed. The evidence -- informed with the incorporation of the best available research and practice knowledge was utilized, instead of a simplified evidence-based approach. Consequently, these guidelines are considered evidence-informed with the incorporation of the best available research and practice knowledge. RESULTS The Task Force defined the medical urgency of a case and developed an IPM acuity scale for elective IPM procedures with 3 tiers. These included emergent, urgent, and elective procedures. Examples of emergent and urgent procedures included new onset or exacerbation of complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), acute trauma or acute exacerbation of degenerative or neurological disease resulting in impaired mobility and inability to perform activities of daily living. Examples include painful rib fractures affecting oxygenation and post-dural puncture headaches limiting the ability to sit upright, stand and walk. In addition, urgent procedures include procedures to treat any severe or debilitating disease that prevents the patient from carrying out activities of daily living. Elective procedures were considered as any condition that is stable and can be safely managed with alternatives. LIMITATIONS COVID-19 continues to be an ongoing pandemic. When these recommendations were developed, different stages of reopening based on geographical regulations were in process. The pandemic continues to be dynamic creating every changing evidence-based guidance. Consequently, we provided evidence-informed guidance. CONCLUSION The COVID-19 pandemic has created unprecedented challenges in IPM creating needless suffering for pain patients. Many IPM procedures cannot be indefinitely postponed without adverse consequences. Chronic pain exacerbations are associated with marked functional declines and risks with alternative treatment modalities. They must be treated with the concern that they deserve. Clinicians must assess patients, local healthcare resources, and weigh the risks and benefits of a procedure against the risks of suffering from disabling pain and exposure to the COVID-19 virus.","Gharibo, Christopher; Sharma, Amit; Soin, Amol; Shah, Shalini; Diwan, Sudhir; Buenaventura, Ricardo; Nampiaparampil, Devi E; Aydin, Steve; Bakshi, Sanjay; Abdi, Salahadin; Jha, Sachin Sunny; Cordner, Harold; Kaye, Alan D; Abd-Elsayed, Alaa; Candido, Kenneth D; Knezevic, Nebojsa Nick; Atluri, Sairam; Wargo, Bradley W; Sanapati, Mahendra R; Datta, Sukdeb; Hirsch, Joshua A; Manchikanti, Laxmaiah; Rajput, Kartic",Pain physician,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32942785/,415

Dairy herds in East Anglia and the south-east of England had a significantly lower risk of being BVDV antibody-positive than herds in the rest of England and Wales. However, these regional differences tended to diminish with increasing herd size. Around 69 per cent of the herds were BHV-1 antibody-positive and all the herds were antibody positive to BRSV and BCV.

In this study, we compared the cleavage recognition site of 55 IBV isolates to determine if the cleavage recognition site sequence, which consists of five basic amino acid residues, correlates with host cell range, serotype, geographic origin, and pathogenicity as it does in orthomyxoviruses and paramyxoviruses. The most common cleavage recognition site observed (33 of 55 viruses) was Arg-Arg-Ser-Arg-Arg, representing at least 11 different serotypes. Thus, cleavage recognition site does not appear to correlate with serotype. We also determined that cleavage recognition site sequence does not correlate with pathogenicity because attenuated and pathogenic isolates (different passages of the same virus) contain identical cleavage recognition site sequences. In addition, nephropathogenic strains had the same cleavage recognition site sequence as many nonnephropathogenic isolates. Cleavage recognition site sequence does correlate with viruses in different geographic regions, which may be an important characteristic to examine in epidemiologic studies. An IBV monoclonal antibody neutralization-resistant mutant (NR 18) had an unusual substitution of Ile for Arg at the fourth position, giving the sequence Arg-Arg-Ser-Ile-Arg, which likely prevents cleavage and, thus, destroys the conformationally dependent monoclonal antibody binding epitope. Six residues on the amino-terminal side of the cleavage recognition site are conserved in 31% of the isolates and consist of only one or two basic amino acids. Thus, the number of basic residues around the cleavage recognition site does not appear to correlate with increased cleavability, host cell range, and increased virulence as it does with envelope glycoproteins in orthomyxoviruses and paramyxoviruses.","Jackwood, M W; Hilt, D A; Callison, S A; Lee, C W; Plaza, H; Wade, E",Avian diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11417816/,415
200189,More on Neurologic Features in Severe SARS-CoV-2 Infection,2020,"Neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) are increasing in both incidence and prevalence and, as a group, are more prevalent than either gastric, pancreatic, oesophageal or hepatobiliary adenocarcinomas, or any two of these cancers combined. Clinical awareness of the protean and intermittent symptoms of NETs (eg, sweating, flushing, diarrhoea, and bronchospasm) is critical for timely diagnosis; however, the classical carcinoid syndrome is relatively uncommon. The most useful diagnostic test for gastrointestinal NETs is measurement of plasma chromogranin A (CgA) levels. Disease extent is assessed by both anatomical imaging, and nuclear imaging with radiolabelled somatostatin analogues. Pathological evaluation comprises tumour-node-metastasis classification, a minimum pathological dataset, CgA and synaptophysin immunostaining, as well as mitotic count or Ki-67 index (a marker of cell proliferation) to define grading. Resection of the primary lesion and as much metastatic disease as possible increases the efficacy of medical therapy. Other management strategies include hepatic embolisation and peptide receptor radionuclide therapy. Patients with tumours expressing somatostatin receptors should be treated with somatostatin analogues. Depending on the tumour grade, other effective agents include cytotoxics, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and antiangiogenics.

Currently, infection with SARS-CoV-2 has been the cause of death of over 2.5 million people globally, and there is still no effective curative treatment. Clinically, the severe symptoms caused by COVID-19, in addition to pneumonia, are associated with the development of hyperinflammatory syndrome and thrombosis. It is urgent to expand our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of COVID-19. This article discusses the potential role that the chemokine CX3CL1 could have in the development of COVID-19-associated thrombosis. CX3CL1 is abundantly expressed by activated endothelium and is an important regulator of many aspects of endothelial function and dysfunction, including thrombosis. The generation of hypotheses about molecules that could be relevant in well-defined aspects of the pathophysiology of COVID-19 encourages the development of basic and clinical studies, that could help find effective and much needed treatments.","Rivas-Fuentes, Selma; Valdés, Víctor Julián; Espinosa, Blanca; Gorocica-Rosete, Patricia; Salgado-Aguayo, Alfonso",Med Hypotheses,,415

We aimed to collect high-quality broad and detailed data from different university medical centers in several European Society of Anesthesiologist countries. METHODS: This prospective observational survey was performed in eight medical centers in Spain, Israel and Portugal from 1st April to 31st July 2020. Institutional review board approval was received at each participating center. Inclusion criteria: all women with a positive test for COVID-19. Retrieved data included maternal, delivery, anesthetic, postpartum details, and neonatal outcomes. Descriptive data are presented, and outcomes were compared for women with versus without respiratory signs and symptoms. RESULTS: Women with respiratory symptoms (20/12.1%) had significantly higher mean (standard deviation) temperature (37.2 °C (0.8) versus 36.8 °C (0.6)), were older (34.1 (6.7) years versus 30.5 (6.6)) and had higher body mass index kg m-2 - (29.5 (7.5) versus 28.2 (5.1)). Women with respiratory symptoms delivered at a significantly earlier gestational age (50% < 37 weeks) with a 65% cesarean delivery rate (versus 22.1% in the group without respiratory symptoms) and 5-fold increased rate of emergency cesarean delivery, 30% performed under general anesthesia. A higher rate of intrauterine fetal death (3%) was observed than expected from the literature (0.2-0.3%) in developed countries. There was no evidence of viral vertical transmission. CONCLUSION: Well-functioning neuraxial analgesia should be available to manage laboring women with respiratory symptoms, as there is a higher frequency of emergency cesarean delivery. We report a higher rate of undiagnosed parturient and intrauterine fetal death.","Ioscovich, Alexander; Guasch, Emilia; Brogly, Nicolas; Shatalin, Daniel; Manrique-Muñoz, Susana; Sánchez Royo, Maria Elena; Zimro, Sabastine; Ginosar, Yehuda; Lages, Neusa; Weinstein, Jacob; Berkenstadt, Haim; Greenberger, Chaim; Lazutkin, Alexey; Izakson, Alexander; Ioscovich, Daniel; Orbach-Zinger, Sharon; Weiniger, Carolyn F",J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med,,415

Declines in energy expenditure resulting from canceled physical education classes and reduced physical activity may elevate childhood obesity risk. This study estimated the impact of COVID-19 on childhood obesity. METHODS: A microsimulation model simulated the trajectory of a nationally representative kindergarten cohort's body mass index z-scores and childhood obesity prevalence from April 2020 to March 2021 under the control scenario without COVID-19 and under the 4 alternative scenarios with COVID-19-Scenario 1: 2-month nationwide school closure in April and May 2020; Scenario 2: Scenario 1 followed by a 10% reduction in daily physical activity in the summer from June to August; Scenario 3: Scenario 2 followed by 2-month school closure in September and October; and Scenario 4: Scenario 3 followed by an additional 2-month school closure in November and December. RESULTS: Relative to the control scenario without COVID-19, Scenarios 1, 2, 3, and 4 were associated with an increase in the mean body mass index z-scores by 0.056 (95% confidence interval (95%CI): 0.055-0.056), 0.084 (95%CI: 0.084-0.085), 0.141 (95%CI: 0.140-0.142), and 0.198 (95%CI: 0.197-0.199), respectively, and an increase in childhood obesity prevalence by 0.640 (95%CI: 0.515-0.765), 0.972 (95%CI: 0.819-1.126), 1.676 (95%CI: 1.475-1.877), and 2.373 (95%CI: 2.135-2.612) percentage points, respectively. Compared to girls and non-Hispanic whites and Asians, the impact of COVID-19 on childhood obesity was modestly larger among boys and non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics, respectively.

One obtained stationary phase (SilprAprImCl) was derived from direct reaction between N-(3-aminopropyl)-imidazole and 3-chloropropylated silica gel. Other two materials (SilprAprImBF4 and SilprAprImTf2N) were obtained from SilprAprImCl by ion exchange reaction, respectively. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and elemental analysis afforded the proofs of successful imidazolium immobilization and satisfied bonding efficiency. Various polar compounds such as saccharides, nucleosides, and nucleobases were utilized to evaluate the retention behaviours of these materials in HILIC mode. Different effects from mobile composition, column temperature, imidazolium unite and paired anions (Cl-, BF4-, and Tf2N-) in imidazolium were proved and discussed. Separation mechanism and the role of the imidazolium ions were also investigated in mobile phases with different pH. Moreover, chromatographic stability was evaluated by consecutive injections. Finally, the reliability of these stationary phases was demonstrated by the separation of oligosaccharides in real fructooligosaccharides samples.","Guo, Dandan; Yang, Chenxi; Qiu, Ruchen; Huang, Shaohua",J Chromatogr A,,415

We have estimated fractal dimension from the Hurst and power law exponent and found the value lying between 1 and 2. The novelty of our approach lies in estimating fractal dimension using image to data conversion and spatial series analysis techniques, crucial for experimentally obtained images.","Banerjee, Debasmita; Jha, Amit Kumar; Iyengar, A.N.Sekar; Janaki, M.

The main complication of HA is the development of neutralizing alloantibodies which inhibit FVIII activity (inhibitors). The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of the first FVIII infusions on immunological biomarkers in previously untreated patients with HA. Plasma samples were collected at enrollment before any FVIII infusion (T0) and at inhibitor development (INB +/T1) or up to 35 exposure days without inhibitors (INB -/T1). Anti-FVIII antibodies (immunoglobulin M, immunoglobulin G [IgG] 1, IgG3, and IgG4), chemokines (CCL2, CCL5, CXCL8, CXCL9, and CXCL10), and cytokines (interleukin [IL]-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, interferon-Î³, tumor necrosis factor, and IL-17) were assessed. A total of 71 children with severe HA were included, of whom 28 (39.4%) developed inhibitors. Plasma levels of anti-FVIII IgG4, IL-6, and CXCL8 were higher at INB +/T1 when compared with INB -/T1. This group presented a mixed cytokine profile and higher plasma levels of CXCL9 and CXL10 when compared with INB +/T1. We conclude that exposure to FVIII triggers a proinflammatory response mediated by IL-6 and CXCL8 in patients with HA who developed inhibitors. Regardless of inhibitor status, the immune system of all HA patients is stimulated after infusions of FVIII.","de Oliveira, Larissa Maira Moura; Jardim, Letícia Lemos; Santana, Marcio Antônio Portugal; Cerqueira, Mônica Hermida; Lorenzato, Claudia Santos; Franco, Vivian Karla Brognoli; Zuccherato, Luciana Werneck; Rezende, Suely Meireles; Chaves, Daniel Gonçalves",Thromb. haemost,,415
215999,Miller-Fisher syndrome after SARS-CoV-2 infection,2020,"Early abortion care became available in Ireland in January 2019. Service delivery involves two consultations with a medical practitioner, separated by a mandatory 3-day waiting period. The Model of Care for termination of pregnancy initially required in-person visits. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic necessitated significant reductions in in-person interactions in healthcare. A revised Model of Care for termination of pregnancy, issued for the duration of the pandemic, permits delivery of early abortion care by remote consultation. Significantly, this was introduced without amending the 2018 abortion law. The pandemic precipitated a rapid development in the delivery of abortion care that was not anticipated at the time of abortion law reform only 18 months earlier. We outline the work undertaken to maintain access to abortion care in early pregnancy through the lens of a single community-level provider and explore what these developments may mean for abortion law, policy, and service delivery.","Spillane, Alison; Taylor, Maeve; Henchion, Caitriona; Venables, Róisín; Conlon, Catherine",Int. j. gynaecol. obstet,,415

In particular, lung cancer is among the most common and deadliest cancers with a low 5-year survival rate. Timely diagnosis of lung cancer is, therefore, of paramount importance as it can save countless lives. In this regard, deep learning radiomics solutions have the promise of extracting the most useful features on their own in an end-to-end fashion without having access to the annotated boundaries. Among different deep learning models, Capsule Networks are proposed to overcome shortcomings of the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) such as their inability to recognize detailed spatial relations. Capsule networks have so far shown satisfying performance in medical imaging problems. Capitalizing on their success, in this study, we propose a novel capsule network-based mixture of experts, referred to as the MIXCAPS. The proposed MIXCAPS architecture takes advantage of not only the capsule network's capabilities to handle small datasets, but also automatically splitting dataset through a convolutional gating network. MIXCAPS enables capsule network experts to specialize on different subsets of the data. Our results show that MIXCAPS outperforms a single capsule network and a mixture of CNNs, with an accuracy of 92.88%, sensitivity of 93.2%, specificity of 92.3% and area under the curve of 0.963. Our experiments also show that there is a relation between the gate outputs and a couple of hand-crafted features, illustrating explainable nature of the proposed MIXCAPS. To further evaluate generalization capabilities of the proposed MIXCAPS architecture, additional experiments on a brain tumor dataset are performed showing potentials of MIXCAPS for detection of tumors related to other organs.","Afshar, Parnian; Naderkhani, Farnoosh; Oikonomou, Anastasia; Rafiee, Moezedin Javad; Mohammadi, Arash; Plataniotis, Konstantinos N.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.06072v1.pdf,415

MATERIALS: This study aims to assess the mental health of health professionals at a critical point in their workload, to compare the results with those the general population, and to explore the potential determinants affecting it. The CAWI survey includes a sociodemographic section, work experience and a standardised psychometric tool (GHQ-28). Data were collected during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Poland (3-29 November 2020), which had the highest mortality rates and SARS-CoV-2 morbidity rates, as well as during the period of a significant increase in deaths, compared to the corresponding pre-pandemic period. RESULTS: A total of 2150 surveys were eligible for analysis. Among them, 848 (39.4%) were active health professionals. In the analysis of the scores of the GHQ-28 scale and its sub-scales, evaluating anxiety/insomnia and somatic symptoms, medical workers scored significantly higher scores than non-medical professions (p < 0.001). Frontline medical workers (p < 0.001) and those who were forcibly seconded to work with COVID-19-infected patients (p = 0.011) achieved significantly higher GHQ-28 scores. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on mental deterioration among health professionals, especially among those directly working with SARS-CoV-2-infected patients and those who were forcibly seconded to work with such patients. To mitigate the effects of the pandemic, appropriate psychological care for medical personnel needs to be implemented.","Babicki, Mateusz; Szewczykowska, Ilona; Mastalerz-Migas, Agnieszka",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,415

Traditionally, the process of genetic testing resided fully within a medical infrastructure, from identification of appropriate testing candidates to gene selection to risk mitigation recommendations. More recently, decreasing costs, advancing technology, and a growing understanding of therapeutic implications of certain genetic test results have led to more widespread uptake of testing that increasingly involves broad multigene panels. Germline genetic testing for breast cancer susceptibility can now be obtained through one of three approaches: through clinical care; a direct-to-consumer (DTC) approach that is entirely consumer-driven; or a hybrid, patient-initiated, provider-mediated model. Increased access to testing has led to extensive dialogue about the best way to conduct testing and act on results. Points of discussion include: selection of appropriate candidates for genetic testing; optimal composition of genes on panels; informed consent; safe return of results; privacy; and legal protections for those found to have relevant pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. As more individuals undergo genetic testing, a growing population of individuals with inherited breast cancer predisposition informs optimal management of cancer risk and also highlights unanswered questions. This article aims to review the current state of genetic testing for inherited breast cancer susceptibility including testing approaches, the legal, ethical and social landscape, and selected contemporary management issues.","Shah, Payal D; Domchek, Susan M",Breast j,,415

We recently reported findings from a comprehensive analysis of innate and adaptive immune responses in 56 healthy volunteers who received two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccination. Here, we analyzed antibody responses to the homologous Wu strain as well as several variants of concern, including the emerging Mu (B.1.621) variant, and T cell responses in a subset of these volunteers at six months (day 210 post-primary vaccination) after the second dose. Our data demonstrate a substantial waning of antibody responses and T cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and its variants, at 6 months following the second immunization with the BNT162b2 vaccine. Notably, a significant proportion of vaccinees have neutralizing titers below the detection limit, and suggest a 3rd booster immunization might be warranted to enhance the antibody titers and T cell responses.","Suthar, Mehul; Arunachalam, Prabhu S; Hu, Mengyun; Reis, Noah; Trisal, Meera; Raeber, Olivia; Chinthrajah, Sharon; Davis-Gardner, Meredith E; Manning, Kelly; Mudvari, Prakriti; Godbole, Sucheta; Boritz, Eli; Henry, Amy R; Douek, Daniel; Nadeau, Kari; Kawaoka, Yoshihiro; Zarnitsyna, Veronika I; Pulendran, Bali; Halfmann, Peter",,,415
224344,SARS-CoV-2 Infected Patient: from a Hematologist's Perspective,2020,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections have triggered global pandemic that continue to impact adversely human health. New understanding has emerged about the innate and adaptive immune responses elicited in SARS-CoV-2 infection. The understanding of innate immune responses generated in hosts early in SARS-CoV-2 infection is vital for treatment efforts. Antiviral cytokines are released by innate immune cells in response to viral infections that play a pivotal role in limiting viral replication, pathology and generating optimal adaptive immune responses alongside the long-term memory responses against reinfections. One aspect of innate immune response generated against SARS-CoV-2 in vivo and which has received much attention has been high proinflammatory cytokine release in COVID-19 patients. Another vital discovery has been that the antiviral cytokine type I Interferon (IFN) family IFN-&#945; mediates upregulation of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) membrane protein in airway epithelial cells. ACE2 is a receptor that SARS-CoV-2 binds to infect host cells. New understanding has emerged about the mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 induced exaggerated proinflammatory cytokine release as well as transcriptional regulation of ACE2. This review discusses various mechanisms underlying SARS-CoV-2 induced exaggerated proinflammatory cytokine response as well as transcriptional regulation of ACE2 receptor.

METHODS: DTH studies were performed by intradermal injection of a commercial recombinant spike protein from SARS-CoV-2 along with conventional serology studies. RESULTS: Fifty-one COVID-19 patients were studied showing 84,3% of concordance with spike-DTH and anti-RBD-IgG. Spike-DTH was superior to identify seven more COVID-19 individuals. A high specificity was found with no positive spike DTH reactions in the non-sick individuals. The skin test also showed more stable results over time while specific anti-RBD-IgG decreased gradually. Clinical severity groups also showed a progressive gradient of larger positive spike-DTH. CONCLUSION: Specific spike DTH test seems to be an easy method to study cell immune response.","Barrios, Yvelise; Franco, Andres; Sanchez-Machin, Inmaculada; Poza-Guedes, Paloma; Gonzalez-Perez, Ruperto; Matheu, Victor",Clin Immunol,,415

METHODS: Articles from PubMed/Medline searches were reviewed using the combination of terms ""SARS-CoV-2, Covid-19, sepsis, mitochondria, aging, and immunometabolism"". RESULTS: Evidence indicates that mitochondria in senescent cells may be dysfunctional and unable to keep up with hypermetabolic demands associated with Covid-19 sepsis. Mitochondrial proteins may serve as damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) activating innate immunity. Disruption in normal oxidative phosphorylation pathways contributes to elevated ROS which activates sepsis cascade through HIF-&#945;/Sirtuin pathway. Viral-mitochondrial interaction may be necessary for replication and increased viral load. Hypoxia and hyper-inflammatory state contribute to increased mortality associated with Covid-19 sepsis. CONCLUSIONS: Aging is associated with worse outcomes in sepsis. Modulating Sirtuin activity is emerging as therapeutic agent in sepsis. HIF-&#945;, levels of mitochondrial DNA, and other mitochondrial DAMP molecules may also serve as useful biomarker and need to be investigated. These mechanisms should be explored specifically for Covid-19-related sepsis.

HCM maintains that culture is not only about cohesiveness and consensus but effective management of conflict and disagreements continuously testing the capacity of people to work together. This book is about organizational transformation positioning people at the center. Complementary chapters integrate as antidotes to overcome disruptions in the VUCA environment and the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic affecting people and organizations worldwide. This and its two complementary titles Soft Skills for Human Centered Management and Global Sustainability and Sensible Leadership: Human Centered, Insightful and Prudent are timely readings for leaders, managers, researchers, academics, practitioners, students and the general public responsible for organizations across industries and sectors worldwide pursuing quality standards and organizational transformation to attain sustainability. © Designs and Patents Act 1988.","Lepeley, M.

228314,Mortality after surgery with SARS-CoV-2 infection in England: a population-wide epidemiological study,2021,"Introduction We have been using telemedicine in the management of hyperthyroidism since 2010. Although telemedicine has been used in different areas of healthcare management for several years, its importance was highlighted during the current coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. The aim of this survey was to assess patient satisfaction with the use of telemedicine in the management of hyperthyroidism. Materials and methods A postal survey was administered to all patients who had received at least one telemedicine session during the months January to May 2020 for the management of hyperthyroidism. Patients were asked to respond to nine statements using the five-point Likert scale. A suggestion box was included for comments and suggestions for improvement. Results There were 106 patients (26 males vs 80 females) with an average age of 53 years who received one to three calls over a five-month study period. A total of 65 respondents returned completed survey forms (61.3% response rate). Approximately 97% of respondents were satisfied with the overall quality of service provided during the use of telemedicine in the management of hyperthyroidism. The telemedicine service was time saving and met their needs. Approximately 14% of respondents were undecided about whether telemedicine was as good as the traditional face-to-face consultation. The respondents also made useful comments and suggestions concerning the provision of adequate time slots, occasional face-to-face appointments, and the introduction of text messaging and emailing to the telemedicine service. Conclusions This survey has demonstrated that the use of telemedicine in the management of hyperthyroidism is desirable to a majority of patients, as long as adequate time slots are dedicated to the telemedicine sessions and patients are reassured of the availability of face-to-face consultation sessions. Regular patient feedback is necessary to perfect the use of telemedicine in a patient-centered healthcare service.","Kaur, Devinder; Galloway, Georgia K; Oyibo, Samson O",Cureus,,415

From mid-February through May 2020, 206,000 (95% credible interval, 178,100-231,000) more people died in these countries than would have had the pandemic not occurred. The number of excess deaths, excess deaths per 100,000 people and relative increase in deaths were similar between men and women in most countries. England and Wales and Spain experienced the largest effect: ~100 excess deaths per 100,000 people, equivalent to a 37% (30-44%) relative increase in England and Wales and 38% (31-45%) in Spain. Bulgaria, New Zealand, Slovakia, Australia, Czechia, Hungary, Poland, Norway, Denmark and Finland experienced mortality changes that ranged from possible small declines to increases of 5% or less in either sex.

233398,Infant With SARS-CoV-2 Infection Causing Severe Lung Disease Treated With Remdesivir,2020,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has highlighted bottlenecks in large-scale, frequent testing of populations for infections. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based diagnostic tests are expensive, reliant on centralized labs, can take days to deliver results, and are prone to backlogs and supply shortages. Antigen tests that bind and detect the surface proteins of a virus are rapid and scalable but suffer from high false negative rates. To address this problem, an inexpensive, simple, and robust 60-minute do-it-yourself (DIY) workflow to detect viral RNA from nasal swabs or saliva with high sensitivity (0.1 to 2 viral particles/µL) and specificity (>97% true negative rate) utilizing reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) was developed. ALERT (Accessible LAMP-Enabled Rapid Test) incorporates the following features: (1) increased shelf-life and ambient temperature storage, compared to liquid reaction mixes, by using wax layers to isolate enzymes from other reagents; (2) improved specificity compared to other LAMP end-point reporting methods, by using sequence-specific QUASR (quenching of unincorporated amplification signal reporters); (3) increased sensitivity, compared to methods without purification through use of a magnetic wand to enable pipette-free concentration of sample RNA and cell debris removal; (4) quality control with a nasopharyngeal-specific mRNA target; and (5) co-detection of other respiratory viruses, such as influenza B, by multiplexing QUASR-modified RT-LAMP primer sets. The flexible nature of the ALERT workflow allows easy, at-home and point-of-care testing for individuals and higher-throughput processing for labs and hospitals. With minimal effort, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-specific primer sets can be swapped out for other targets to repurpose ALERT to detect other viruses, microorganisms, or nucleic acid-based markers.","Bektas, Ali; Covington, Michael F; Aidelberg, Guy; Arce, Anibal; Matute, Tamara; Núñez, Isaac; Walsh, Julia; Boutboul, David; Delaugerre, Constance; Lindner, Ariel B; Federici, Fernán; Jayaprakash, Anitha D",Viruses,,415

In this cohort study, patients with a confirmed diagnosis of severe COVID-19 admitted to Imam Hossein Medical Center, Tehran, Iran from March 2019 to July 2020 were included. Demographics and related clinical data during their hospitalization were recorded. The mortality rate of the patients was considered as the primary outcome and its association with aspirin use was assessed. Nine hundred and ninety-one patients were included, of that 336 patients (34%) received aspirin during their hospitalization and 655 ones (66%) did not. Comorbidities were more prevalent in the patients who were receiving aspirin. Results from the multivariate COX proportional model demonstrated a significant independent association between aspirin use and reduction in the risk of in-hospital mortality (0.746 [0.560-0.994], p = 0.046). Aspirin use in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 is associated with a significant decrease in mortality rate. Further prospective randomized controlled trials are needed to assess the efficacy and adverse effects of aspirin administration in this population.","Haji Aghajani, Mohammad; Moradi, Omid; Amini, Hossein; Azhdari Tehrani, Hamed; Pourheidar, Elham; Rabiei, Mohammad M; Sistanizad, Mohammad",J. med. virol,,415

This kind of question is appropriate for public health responses and it will depend on the early estimates of the key epidemiological parameters of the virus in a defined population.In this study, we combined a likelihood-based method using a Bayesian framework and compartmental model of the epidemic of COVID-19 in Nigeria to estimate the effective reproduction number (R(t)) and basic reproduction number (R0) - this also enables us to estimate the initial daily transmission rate (ß0). We further estimate the reported fraction of symptomatic cases. The models are applied to the NCDC data on COVID-19 symptomatic and death cases from 27 February 2020 and 7 May 2020.In this period, the effective reproduction number is estimated with a minimum value of 0.18 and a maximum value of 2.29. Most importantly, the R(t) is strictly greater than one from 13 April till 7 May 2020. The R0 is estimated to be 2.42 with credible interval: (2.37-2.47). Comparing this with the R(t) shows that control measures are working but not effective enough to keep R(t) below 1. Also, the estimated fraction of reported symptomatic cases is between 10 and 50%.Our analysis has shown evidence that the existing control measures are not enough to end the epidemic and more stringent measures are needed.","Adekunle, A I; Adegboye, O A; Gayawan, E; McBryde, E S",Epidemiol Infect,,415

Long-held assumptions about laboratory management have been reconsidered in light of these new circumstances. METHODS: Experience during the first 6 months of the COVID-19 pandemic at a clinical reference laboratory was reviewed in the context of several commonly held management principles to assess their relevance to clinical laboratory operations during a crisis. RESULTS: Management and operational ideas regarding different modes of communication, physical proximity and interaction, operating under a fixed budget, and maintaining a breadth of laboratory service offerings have been challenged during the COVID-19 pandemic. The importance of putting people first, maintaining collaboration, and providing effective leadership and communication throughout an organization have been highlighted. CONCLUSIONS: The collaborative activities of highly interdependent teams and individuals have helped the clinical laboratory community respond to society's needs in the COVID-19 crisis. Not all laboratory management principles apply equally well in the course of an international respiratory pandemic. When navigating crises, leaders need to distinguish situational management principles from those that are universal.","Jackson, Brian R; Genzen, Jonathan R",Am. j. clin. pathol,,415

Given that the 3 chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) of SARS-CoV-2 plays an indispensable role in viral polyprotein processing, its successful inhibition halts viral replication and thus constrains virus spread. Therefore, developing an effective SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibitor to treat COVID-19 is imperative. A fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based method was used to assess the proteolytic activity of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro using intramolecularly quenched fluorogenic peptide substrates corresponding to the cleavage sequence of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro. Molecular modeling with GEMDOCK was used to simulate the molecular interactions between drugs and the binding pocket of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro. This study revealed that the Vmax of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro was about 2-fold higher than that of SARS-CoV 3CLpro. Interestingly, the proteolytic activity of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro is slightly more efficient than that of SARS-CoV 3CLpro. Meanwhile, natural compounds PGG and EGCG showed remarkable inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro than against SARS-CoV 3CLpro. In molecular docking, PGG and EGCG strongly interacted with the substrate binding pocket of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro, forming hydrogen bonds with multiple residues, including the catalytic residues C145 and H41. The activities of PGG and EGCG against SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro demonstrate their inhibition of viral protease activity and highlight their therapeutic potentials for treating SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Chiou, Wei-Chung; Chen, Jui-Chieh; Chen, Yun-Ti; Yang, Jinn-Moon; Hwang, Lih-Hwa; Lyu, Yi-Shuan; Yang, Hsin-Yi; Huang, Cheng",Biochem. biophys. res. commun,,415

Of the 91 participants initially testing positive, 86 participated in follow-up approximately 14 days after study enrollment; of those 86 participants, 19 (22.1%) developed at least one symptom at any time after the initial positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) test result. The median number of days to symptom development after their initial positive test result was 6 (range 1-29 days). No participants reported a SARS-CoV-2-related hospitalization. The most frequently reported symptoms were fatigue or muscle aches (10.5%), headache (9.3%), fever (5.8%), and shortness of breath (5.8%). Of the 78 participants who submitted a nasopharyngeal swab for repeat RT-PCR testing, 17 (21.8%) remained positive at Day 14, 4 of which continued to test positive at Day 28. These findings reinforce the probable role of silent SARS-CoV-2 infections in community transmission, and that reliance on symptom development will miss a large proportion of infections. Broad testing programs not limited to individuals presenting with symptoms are critical for identifying persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection and ultimately slowing transmission.","Meyers, Kristin J; Dillman, Brian; Williams, Charles; Jiang, Jianfei; Clifford, Nancy; Miller, Jennifer L; Jones, Meghan E; Goetz, Iris A; Botros, Fady T; Knorr, Jack; Manner, David H; Woodward, Brad",J. med. virol,,415

In view of new challenges such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the importance of their social responsibility and ability to effectively communicate the socially–responsible activities which are performed is growing. The aim of this article is to analyze and evaluate the scope and structure of socially-responsible activities communicated on the websites of public higher education institutions operating in a small post-communist country where education plays a traditional role—the Czech Republic, and to formulate recommendations for improvement of the level of communication of social responsibility by higher education institutions. Primary data was obtained using latent analysis of the content of the websites of all public higher education institutions operating in the Czech Republic. The CE3SPA method was applied. The survey which was performed shows that the level of communication of social responsibility by higher education institutions in the Czech Republic is low. Activities in the field of economic and social responsibility are communicated in the greatest scope. On the contrary, activities in the field of environmental responsibility are communicated the least. Public higher education institutions in the Czech Republic should therefore apply the measures proposed in the article, these also being transferrable to practice in other countries.","Vavra, Jan Munzarova Simona",Sustainability,,415

Our prediction model indicates that the French authorities' adoption of a gradual release from lockdown could lead in March 2021 to a virus prevalence similar to that before lockdown. However, a massive vaccination campaign initiated in January 2021 and the continuation of public health measures over several months could curb the spread of virus and thus relieve the load on hospitals.","Dimeglio, Chloé; Miedougé, Marcel; Loubes, Jean-Michel; Mansuy, Jean-Michel; Izopet, Jacques",Rev Med Virol,,415
247824,Sex Differences in the Outcome of Patients with Confirmed SARS-CoV-2 Infection,2020,"Background: The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) resulted in an unprecedented public health challenge worldwide. Despite urgent and extensive global efforts, the existing evidence is inconclusive regarding the medications used for the treatment of COVID-19. Purpose: To generate an up-to-date evidence for the clinical safety and efficacy of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) with or without azithromycin (AZ) among patients treated for COVID-19. Data Source. PubMed, Cochrane CENTRAL, LITCOVID, Web of Science, SCOPUS, BioRxiv, Embase, MedRxiv, and Wiley online library were searched from 2019/12/30 to 2020/05/23. Study Selection. Three investigators assessed the quality of the studies. Data Extraction. Data about study characteristics, effect estimates, and the quality of the studies were extracted by two independent reviewers and cross-checked by the third reviewer. Data Synthesis. The data of 6,782 (HCQ group, 3623; HCQ + AZ group, 1,020; control group, 2139) participants were included. HCQ was compared with standard care for virologic efficacy, disease progression, mortality, and adverse effects. HCQ was also compared with HCQ + AZ for QTc prolongation, admission to the intensive care unit, and mortality. The study found HCQ did not alter the rate of virologic cure (OR = 0.78; 95% CI: 0.39-1.56) and the risk of mortality (OR = 1.26; 95% CI: 0.66-2.39). The pooled prevalence for mortality was 5.8% (95% CI: 0.9%-10.8%). Moreover, HCQ did not impact disease progression (OR = 0.9; 95% CI: 0.36-2.29) but resulted in a higher risk of adverse effects (OR = 2.35; 95% CI: 1.15-4.8). HCQ was also compared against HCQ + AZ, and no difference was observed in QTc prolongation above 500 ms (OR = 1.11; 95% CI: 0.54-2.28), admission to the intensive care unit (OR = 0.92; 95% CI: 0.52-1.63), and mortality (OR = 0.88; 95% CI: 0.55-1.43). However, in the analysis of single-arm studies, about 11.2% (95% CI: 7.0%-15.5%) of patients have developed an absolute increase of QTc greater than 500 ms, and 4.1% (95% CI: 1.1%-7.1%) of patients discontinued their medication. Conclusion: This meta-analysis and systematic review, which included a limited number of poorly designed studies of patients with COVID-19, revealed HCQ is intolerable, unsafe, and not efficacious. Similarly, HCQ + AZ combination was not different from HCQ alone in curbing mortality and ICU admission.","Ayele Mega, Teshale; Feyissa, Temesgen Mulugeta; Dessalegn Bosho, Dula; Kumela Goro, Kabaye; Zeleke Negera, Getandale",Can Respir J,,415
248057,Community-Acquired Neonatal SARS-CoV-2 Infection Associated with Neurological Symptoms in Colombia,2021,"Overexpression of DTYMK is related with tumorigenesis and progression in several human tumors. However, the role of upregulated DTYMK in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients still remains unclear. In this study, the DTYMK expression in HCC tumors was evaluated in three GEO series (GSE14520, GSE54236, GSE63898), TCGA-LIHC, and ICGC-IRLR-JP cohorts. Survival analysis of DTYMK based on TCGA-LIHC and ICGC-LIRI-JP cohorts was conducted. We found that DTYMK was dramatically upregulated in tumor tissue compared with that in adjacent liver tissue. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that high expression of DTYMK in HCC patients' tumor tissue was significantly corresponded to worse overall survival (OS) (P < 0.05). Further analysis showed that overexpressing DTYMK led to poor relapse free survival (RFS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) (all P < 0.05). In conclusion, DTYMK is upregulated in tumors and correlated with poor prognosis in HCC patients. In our report, DTYMK is higher expression in HCC cancer tissue and cell line than tumor adjacent tissue and normal liver cell line. Knocking down DTYMK can inhabit tumor cell proliferation by interfering cell cycle, whereas overexpression of DTYMK can promote tumor cell proliferation. These findings indicate that upregulation of DTYMK enhances tumor growth and proliferation by promoting cell cycle.","Zhou, Tianhao; Qin, Rui; Shi, Susu; Zhang, Hua; Niu, Chuanling; Ju, Gaoda; Miao, Sen",Cell Cycle,,415

However, the need for dedicated monoclonal antibodies suitable for molecular pathology research is not fully addressed. Here, we produced six mouse anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike monoclonal antibodies that exhibit not only robust performance in immunoassays including western blotting, ELISA, immunofluorescence, and immunoprecipitation, but also demonstrate neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 infection to VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells. Due to their mouse origin, our monoclonal antibodies are compatible with the experimental immunoassay setups commonly used in basic molecular biology research laboratories, providing a useful tool for future research. Furthermore, in the hope of applying the antibodies of clinical setting, we determined the variable regions of the antibodies and used them to produce recombinant human/mouse chimeric antibodies.","Guo, Youjia; Kawaguchi, Atsushi; Takeshita, Masaru; Sekiya, Takeshi; Hirohama, Mikako; Yamashita, Akio; Siomi, Haruhiko; Murano, Kensaku",J Biol Chem,,415

The national Kidney Allocation System prioritizes patients with Estimated Post-Transplant Survival (EPTS) scores in the top 20% for expedited access to optimal deceased donor kidneys. METHODS: We studied adults aged &#8805;18 years in the United States Renal Data System with top 20% EPTS scores who had been preemptively waitlisted or initiated dialysis in 2015-2017. We evaluated time to waitlist placement, transplantation, and mortality with unadjusted and multivariable survival models. RESULTS: Of 42,445 patients with top 20% EPTS scores (mean age, 38.0 years; 57% male; 59% White patients, and 31% Black patients), 7922 were preemptively waitlisted. Among 34,523 patients initiating dialysis, the 3-year cumulative waitlist placement incidence was 37%. Numerous factors independently associated with waitlisting included race, income, and having noncommercial insurance. For example, waitlisting was less likely for Black versus White patients, and for patients in the lowest-income neighborhoods versus those in the highest-income neighborhoods. Among patients initiating dialysis, 61% lost their top 20% EPTS status within 30 months versus 18% of patients who were preemptively listed. The 3-year incidence of deceased and living donor transplantation was 5% and 6%, respectively, for patients who initiated dialysis and 26% and 44%, respectively, for patients who were preemptively listed. CONCLUSIONS: Many patients with ESKDqualifying with top 20% EPTS status are not placed on the transplant waiting list in a timely manner, with significant variation on the basis of demographic and social factors. Patients who are preemptively listed are more likely to receive benefits of top 20% EPTS status. Efforts to expedite care for qualifying candidates are needed, and automated transplant referral for patients with the best prognoses should be considered.","Schold, Jesse D; Huml, Anne M; Poggio, Emilio D; Sedor, John R; Husain, Syed A; King, Kristin L; Mohan, Sumit",J.

However, although infants' categories appear externally to match those formed by adults, it is not clear that they are grounded in an organized hierarchical system that embodies relations within and between domains; that is, a taxonomy. To assess whether it is appropriate to consider infants' categories as taxonomies, 3 criteria are examined: (a) similarity to adults' choice of category members, (b) hierarchical understanding, and (c) agreement with adults' bases for classification. It is argued that infants' categories do not meet these criteria and that it may be erroneous to apply the same labels to categories formed in the first 2 years as those in later life. To do so may be to hold an illusion of taxonomies about infants' categories.","Rakison, David H",Infancy,,415
252413,Acute Limb Ischemia in Minimally Symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 Infection,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To reconstruct the transmission trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 and analyze the effects of control measures in China. METHODS: Python 3.7.1 was used to write a SEIR class to model the epidemic procedure and proportional estimation method to estimate the initial true infected number. The epidemic area in China was divided into three parts, Wuhan city, Hubei province (except Wuhan) and China (except Hubei) based on the different transmission pattern. A testing capacity limitation factor for medical resources was imposed to model the number of infected but not quarantined individuals. Baidu migration data were used to assess the number of infected individuals who migrated from Wuhan to other areas. RESULTS: Basic reproduction number, R0, was 3.6 before the city was lockdown on Jan 23, 2020. The actual infected number the model predicted was 4508 in Wuhan before Jan 23, 2020. By January 22 2020, it was estimated that 1764 infected cases migrated from Wuhan to other cities in Hubei province. Effective reproductive number, R, gradually decreased from 3.6 (Wuhan), 3.4 (Hubei except Wuhan,) and 3.3 (China except Hubei) in stage 1 (from Dec 08, 2019 to Jan 22, 2020) to 0.67 (Wuhan), 0.59 (Hubei except Wuhan) and 0.63 (China except Hubei) respectively. Especially after January 23, 2020 when Wuhan City was closed, the infected number showed a turning point in Wuhan. By early April, there would be 42073 (95% confidence interval, 41673 to 42475), 21342 (95% confidence interval, 21057 to 21629) and 13384 (95% confidence interval, 13158 to 13612) infected cases in Wuhan, Hubei (except Wuhan) and China (except Hubei), respectively. CONCLUSION: A series of control measures in China have effectively prevented the spread of COVID-19, and the epidemic should be under control in early April with very few new cases occasionally reported.","Zhang, Bo; Zhou, Hongwei; Zhou, Fang",PLoS One,,415

Classical compartmental models are useful, however, likely oversimplify the complexity when studying epidemics. This study aimed to develop a multi-regional, hierarchical-tier mathematical model for better understanding the complexity and heterogeneity of COVID-19 spread and control. By incorporating the epidemiological and population flow data, we have successfully constructed a multi-regional, hierarchical-tier SLIHR model. With this model, we revealed insight into how COVID-19 was spread from the epicentre Wuhan to other regions in Mainland China based on the large population flow network data. By comprehensive analysis of the effects of different control measures, we identified that Level 1 emergency response, community prevention and application of big data tools significantly correlate with the effectiveness of local epidemic containment across different provinces of China outside the epicentre. In conclusion, our multi-regional, hierarchical-tier SLIHR model revealed insight into how COVID-19 spread from the epicentre Wuhan to other regions of China, and the subsequent control of local epidemics. These findings bear important implications for many other countries and regions to better understand and respond to their local epidemics associated with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","Zheng, Qinyue; Wang, Xinwei; Bao, Chunbing; Ji, Yunpeng; Liu, Hua; Meng, Qingchun; Pan, Qiuwei",Transbound. emerg. dis.

254668,Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infected patients with persistent negative CT findings,2020,"As an important strategic emerging industry to promote sustainable economic development, new energy vehicles (NEVs) play multiple vital roles in energy saving and emission reduction and promote the transformation and upgrading of the automobile industry. China's government has formulated abundant policies to support the NEV industry. Existing studies do not pay enough attention to the latent information from NEV policy documents. This paper explores the latent topics of numerous NEV policy documents and their impact on promoting NEVs at the city level by combining the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model and the econometric method. The results show that the latent topics of NEV policy documents can be categorized into charging infrastructure operation, promotion subsidy, and production support. The prevalence of the promotion subsidy topic is the strongest among the three types of topics. Total topic prevalences significantly promote NEV sales. The 2013 year is a turning point in policy preferences, and this change boosts NEV sales. The prevalence of promotion subsidy topic has an inverted U-shaped effect on NEV sales. The NEV sales will increase by 19% when the prevalence of production support topic increases by 1. Under the COVID-19, although the promotion subsidy policy is still dominant, the production support policy has been paid more attention. Finally, combining the development of China's NEV industry under the COVID-19 epidemic, the paper puts forward pertinent policy suggestions.","Li, Jingjing Jiao Jianling Xu Yuwen Chen Chuxi",Sustainable Production and Consumption,,415

Parents' management of their child's hearing aids (HAs) and regular follow-up with healthcare providers HA are fundamental components of effective intervention. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this systematic review was to synthesise the current literature on HA use in the paediatric population, and the secondary objective was to review the factors associated with HA use. METHODS: Electronic databases, including MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and LLBA from 2005 to 2019, were searched. Two reviewers individually screened potentially relevant articles over two phases. RESULTS: Fifteen studies met this review criteria. Four studies reported HA use based on data logging records. In nine studies, the amount of HA use was evaluated based on parents' reports, and three studies concluded that parents overestimate their child's HA use. Age, degree of HL and parents' education level were the most frequently reported factors associated with a child's amount of HA use. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this review will provide a foundation for future studies on the importance of monitoring HA use and the impact of consistent HA use on the language development of children with HL.","Salamatmanesh, Mina; Sikora, Lindsey; Bahraini, Sayna; MacAskill, Melissa; Lagace, Josée; Ramsay, Tim; Fitzpatrick, Elizabeth M",Int J Audiol,,415

Over the next two years as more approved vaccines are made available and supply meets or exceeds demand, medical and public health professionals will increasingly be faced with the challenge of vaccine hesitancy. There is an urgent need to create demand in groups that are either uninformed, vaccine hesitant, or actively resistant to COVID-19 vaccination. This study reviews theory, evidence, and practice recommendations to develop a vaccine demand creation strategy that has wide applicability. Specifically, we focus on key elements including supply side confidence, vaccine brand promotion strategy, service marketing as it relates to vaccine distribution, and competition strategy. We present evidence that these strategies can make a significant contribution to overcoming COVID-19 hesitancy in a high supply scenario. The paper also makes recommendations about factors that need to be considered in relation to vaccine delivery services and systems that, if done badly, may reduce uptake or result in the creation of more vaccine hesitancy. In summary, there is a need for well researched and tested demand creation strategies that integrate with brand strategy, supply side, and service delivery.","Evans, W.

His fame came chiefly from his extensive explorations in South America, and his eminence as a plant naturalist. He attempted to climb the inactive volcano, Chimborazo, in Ecuador, which was thought to be the highest mountain in the world at the time, and he reached an altitude of about 5543 m which was a record height for humans. During the climb, he had typical symptoms of acute mountain sickness which he correctly attributed to the low level of oxygen, and he was apparently the first person to make this connection. His ability as a naturalist enabled him to recognize the effect of high altitude on the distribution of plants, and by comparing his observations on Chimborazo with those in the European Alps and elsewhere, he inferred that the deleterious effects of high altitude were universal. During his return trip to Europe he called on President Thomas Jefferson in Washington where he was given a warm reception and discussed conservation issues. He then returned to Paris where he produced 29 volumes over a period of 31 years describing his travels. Here the effects of high altitude on the distribution of plants compared with animals is briefly reviewed. Following Humboldt's death in 1859, there was extensive coverage of his contributions, but curiously, his fame has diminished over the years, and inexplicably, he now has a much lower profile in North America.","West, John B","Am. j. physiol., lung cell. mol. physiol",,415

This defining moment in our lives has created wide-ranging discussions in many segments of our societies, both politically and socially. Over time, the pandemic has been associated with many social and political topics, as well as sentiments and emotions. Twitter offers a platform to understand these effects. The primary objective of this study is to capture the awareness and sentiment about COVID-19-related issues and to find how they relate to the number of cases and deaths in a representative region of the United States. The study uses a unique dataset consisting of over 46 million tweets from over 91,000 users in 88 counties of the state of Ohio, a state-of-the-art deep learning model to measure and detect awareness and emotions. The data collected is analyzed using OLS regression and System-GMM dynamic panel. Findings indicate that the pandemic has drastically changed the perception of the Republican party in the society. Individual motivations are strongly influenced by ideological choices and this ultimately affects individual pandemic-related outcomes. The paper contributes to the literature by expanding the knowledge on COVID-19 (i), offering a representative result for the United States by focusing on an ""average"" state like Ohio (ii), and incorporating the sentiment and emotions into the calculation of awareness (iii).","Caliskan, Cantay",J Comput Soc Sci,,415

Methods Five commercial immunoassays and a neutralising activity assay were used to detect antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in routine primary care and paediatric samples collected during the first wave of the pandemic in NHS Lothian, Scotland as part of ongoing surveillance efforts. For each assay, sensitivity and specificity was calculated relative to consensus results (majority of immunoassays positive = overall positive) and neutralising activity. Quantitative correlation was performed between serological and neutralising titres. Results Seroprevalence ranged from 3.4-7.3 % in primary care patients and 3-5.9 % in paediatric patients according to different immunoassays. Neutralising activity was detectable in 2.8 % and 1.3 % respectively. Relative assay performance changed depending on comparison to immunoassay consensus versus neutralising activity and qualititative versus quantitative agreement. Cross-reactivity with endemic seasonal coronaviruses was confirmed by neutralising assay in false positives for one immunoassay. Presence of false positives for another assay was found specifically in paediatric but not adult samples. Conclusions Five serological assays show variable accuracy when applied to the general population, impacting seroprevalence estimates. Assay performance may also vary in detection of protective neutralising antibody levels. These aspects should be considered in assay selection and interpretation in epidemiological studies.","McDonald, Lindsay Wise Helen Muecksch Frauke Poston Daniel Mavin Sally Templeton Kate Furrie Elizabeth Richardson Claire McGuire Jaqueline Jarvis Lisa Malloy Kristen McAuley Andrew Palmateer Norah Dickson Elizabeth Hatziioannou Theodora Bieniasz Paul Jenks Sara",Journal of Clinical Virology Plus,,415

Methods: An online survey was sent to the practicing ophthalmologists across India. Data were collected from the responding ophthalmologists and analysed using Medcalc 16.4 software. Results: A total of 794 responses were obtained. Most respondents (51%) were in the age group 30-50 years and were in independent practice (40.05%). Almost three-fourth of ophthalmologists resumed their surgical services after a gap of more than a month post-lockdown. Almost a third of the respondents had significant reduction in their surgical workload during this period. Significant fear of contracting COVID-19 infection in the operation theatres was reported while moderate difficulty was found in procuring protective gear during immediate post-national lockdown period. Conclusion: The pandemic has changed the ophthalmic practice significantly, with patient and staff safety becoming areas of major concern.

The D-dimer is frequently elevated in COVID-19, but other markers of coagulation activation, including the prothrombin fragment 1.2 (PF1.2) are poorly described. We studied hospitalized adults with COVID-19 and PF1.2 measurements performed at any time during hospitalization. We evaluated the relationship between PF1.2 and synchronously measured D-dimer. We utilized receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to evaluate optimal thresholds for diagnosing thrombosis and multivariable logistic regression to evaluate association with thrombosis. A total of 115 patients were included [110 (95.7%) critically ill]. Both PF1.2 and D-dimer were moderately positively correlated (r = 0.542, P < .001) but significant discordance was observed in elevation of each marker above the laboratory reference range (59.0% elevated PF1.2 vs 98.5% elevated D-dimer). Median PF1.2 levels were higher in patients with thrombosis than those without (611 vs 374 pmol/L, P = .006). In ROC analysis, PF1.2 had superior specificity and conferred a higher positive likelihood ratio in identifying patients with thrombosis than D-dimer (PF1.2 threshold of >523 pmol/L: 69.2% sensitivity, 67.7% specificity; >924 pmol/L: 37.9% sensitivity, 87.8% specificity). In multivariable analysis, a PF1.2 >500 pmol/L was significantly associated with VTE [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 4.26, 95% CI, 1.12-16.21, P = .034] and any thrombotic manifestation (adjusted OR 3.85, 95% CI, 1.39-10.65, P = .010); conversely, synchronously measured D-dimer was not significantly associated with thrombosis. 90.6% of patients with a non-elevated PF1.2 result did not develop VTE. So, PF1.2 may be a useful assay, and potentially more discriminant than D-dimer, in identifying thrombotic manifestations in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.","Al-Samkari, Hanny; Song, Fei; Van Cott, Elizabeth M; Kuter, David J; Rosovsky, Rachel",Am. j. hematol,,415

This study aimed to investigate the spread of family violence and detect the predictors of it with the applied advanced statistical procedure, structural equation modeling (SEM). The researchers prepared the family violence scale that consisted of 21 items, and applied it in a random sample that consisted of (312) individual. The finding indicated that there are high levels of family violence, violence between spouses, violence from parents to children, and sibling violence. As well as, the findings found that the years of marriage are statistically significant of violence between spouses, violence from parents to children, and sibling violence, and the total score of the family violence. As well as, sex is a statistically significant predictor of violence between spouses. While the educational level, age, and income level did not predict violence (total score or dimensions). Based on the results of the current study, counseling programs to reduce family violence and psychotherapy programs to reduce the negative effects of family violence on parents and children must be planned.

Exclusion criteria involved any situation that could impair testicular function. Statistical analysis compared independent groups, classified by any pathological change. Categorical and numerical outcome hypotheses were tested by Fisher's Exact and Mann-Whitney tests, using the Excel for Mac, version 16.29 (p < .05). The sample size was 26 men (mean 33.7 ± 6.2 years; range: 21-42 years), all without scrotal complaints. No orchitis was seen. Eleven men (32.6 ± 5.8 years) had epididymitis (42.3%), bilateral in 19.2%. More than half of men with epididymitis displayed epididymal head augmentation > 1.2 cm (p = .002). Two distinct epididymitis' patterns were reported: (a) disseminated micro-abscesses (n = 6) and (b) inhomogeneous echogenicity with reactional hydrocele (n = 5).

As relações morfométricas, o tamanho na maturidade e o ciclo reprodutivo desta espécie foram analisados, com amostras coletadas entre 34ºS e 42ºS. A faixa de tamanho foi de 190 a 674 mm de comprimento total (TL) para machos e de 135 a 709 mm para fêmeas. O dimorfismo sexual entre as relações TL - largura do disco e TL - peso total foi encontrado, com as fêmeas mais largas e mais pesadas que os machos. O tamanho médio na maturidade para machos foi estimado em 530 mm TL e para fêmeas em 570 mm TL. O índice gonadossomático (IGS) em fêmeas maduras variou sazonalmente e apresentou o maior valor em dezembro. O diâmetro folicular máximo e a largura da glândula do oviduto não apresentaram nenhum padrão sazonal. Fêmeas com ovos no útero estavam presentes a maior parte do ano. A atividade reprodutiva nos machos seria contínua ao longo do ano, evidenciada pela falta de variação do IGS entre as estações do ano.

What about antenatal corticosteroids?,2020,"With the iPad-mediated cognitive assessment gaining popularity with school districts and the need for alternative modes for training and instruction during this COVID-19 pandemic, school psychology training programs will need to adapt to effectively train their students to be competent in administering, scoring, an interpreting cognitive assessment instruments. This manuscript describes a mixed methods study of graduate students learning both the traditional and digital format (Q-interactive) of the WISC-V, with the goal of improving training methods and reducing administration and scoring errors. Results indicated that more errors are made on the traditional format than on the digital format, but the errors that did occur on the digital format were on subtests that require clinical acumen. Q-interactive did not reduce errors related to more complex judgments and nuanced scoring. The participating graduate students were surveyed regarding their perceptions of each format, and they revealed a majority preference for the digital format. Training implications are discussed, and specific suggestions provided for how training programs may respond to our current situation by integrating Q-interactive into their assessment courses.","Corcoran, Stephanie",Contemp Sch Psychol,,415

METHODS: An exploratory qualitative study approach was used. Semi-structured questions were devised and used to elicit data on the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on women accessing treatment for HIV. Twenty women were interviewed through contacts from community and faith organizations in peri-urban Harare. All interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and entered into NVivo to make analysis easy. The data were thematically analyzed, underpinned by the four phases of data analysis in the Silences Framework. RESULTS: The study discovered that transport problems, confusing COVID-19 restrictions, abuse by police and soldiers at roadblocks, a shortage of medication, lack of health check-up routines, involuntary default of ART, and a shortage of personal protective equipment affected HIV-positive women accessing ART during the COVID-19 lockdown. CONCLUSION: People living with HIV need a robust supporting environment and a functioning health system. In response to COVID-19 all services were halted to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Pandemic preparedness is important in keeping an adequate supply of ART and responding to the needs of individuals on HIV treatment.","Nyashanu, Mathew; Chireshe, Rumbidzai; Mushawa, Fungisai; Ekpenyong, Mandu S",Int J Gynaecol Obstet,,415

This study aimed to test for the existence of serum biomarkers in CLBP patients with MC. METHODS: Age- and sex-matched CLBP patients with confirmed MC on lumbar MRI (n = 40) and pain-free controls (n = 40) were assessed. MC was classified into M1, predominating M1, predominating M2 and M2. MC volumes were calculated. Fasting blood samples were assessed for inflammatory mediators, signalling molecules, growth factors and bone turnover markers. Serum concentrations of 46 biomarkers were measured. RESULTS: Median concentrations of interleukin (IL)-15 (p < 0.001), IL-8 (p < 0.001), tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha (p < 0.001), Eotaxin-1 (p < 0.05), Eotaxin-3 (p < 0.001), monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1 (p < 0.05), macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha (p < 0.01), TEK receptor tyrosine kinase (Tie)-2 (p < 0.001), vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1 (p < 0.001), RANTES (p < 0.001), C telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX)-1 (p < 0.001), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-C (p < 0.001), VEGF-D (p < 0.05), fms-related tyrosine kinase (Flt)-1 (p < 0.01) and intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 (p < 0.01) were significantly higher among controls. IL-1sRII (23.2 vs. 15.5 ng/ml, p < 0.001) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)-1 (169 vs. 105 pg/ml, p < 0.01) concentrations were significantly higher among patients. Type or volume of MC was not associated with biomarker concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to assess the blood serum biomarker profile in individuals with CLBP with MC. Several biomarkers were suppressed, while two markers (IL-1sRII and HGF) were elevated among MC patients, irrespective of MC type or size, with CLBP compared with asymptomatic controls.","Karppinen, Jaro; Koivisto, Katri; Ketola, Jukka; Haapea, Marianne; Paananen, Markus; Herzig, Karl-Heinz; Alini, Mauro; Lotz, Jeffrey; Dudli, Stefan; Samartzis, Dino; Risteli, Juha; Majuri, Marja-Leena; Alenius, Harri; Kyllönen, Eero; Järvinen, Jyri; Niinimäki, Jaakko; Grad, Sibylle",Eur. spine j,,415

271314,SARS-CoV-2 Infection Related Diabetes Mellitus,2021,"Introduction: Exposure to telestroke in neurology residency is sparse despite its implementation in daily practice. Due to COVID-19, we increased our utilization of telestroke. Given this change in workflow, we investigated how residents utilize telestroke for “Code Brain” (CB) acute stroke evaluations and if expanding the use of telestroke in neurology residency programs is justified. Methods: We retrospectively compared the number of CB evaluations, door to needle (DTN) times, door to decision (DTD) times, and NIHSS from March - June 2019 (in-person evaluations) against those in March - June 2020 (telestroke evaluations). We limited our study to resident-involved cases. Nighttime and weekend CBs are run by a neurology resident and are remotely supervised. Daytime CBs can be run by a resident, fellow, or attending. We assumed that nighttime CBs are resident-run and daytime evaluations are the stroke team's evaluation. Statistical analysis was performed using R. Results: There were a total of 217 CBs in March - June 2019 and 115 in March - June 2020. In 2019, there were 120 daytime and 97 nighttime CBs;in 2020 there were 62 and 53. The mean DTN for the day for 2019 and 2020 was 45.9 ± 23.2 and 48.4 ± 20.2 (P=0.08). The mean DTN during the night for 2019 and 2020 was 67.3 ± 53.7 and 53.8 ± 25.8 (P=0.64). The mean DTD during the day for 2019 and 2020 was 48.1 ± 41.0 and 44.9 ± 37.6 (P=0.25). The mean DTD during the night for 2019 and 2020 was 60.9 ± 51.1 and 65.8 ± 94.6 (P=0.68). Using a generalized linear model approach to correct for shift (day/night), age, NIHSS, we found no significant differences in DTN or DTD before and after implementing resident-run telestroke. Using Cohen's approach (1988) we estimated a Type 2 error probability at 7%. Discussion: Our findings show that resident-run telestroke CBs are comparable to CBs run by fellows and attendings as DTN and DTD were not significantly different between the CBs run by residents in-person or via telestroke. These metrics are also comparable for CBs in which a fellow or attending are supervising or running the CB. Implementing resident-run telestroke consultation showed no effect on DTN or DTD after accounting for patient age, NIHSS, or the time of day. These data should reassure programs seeking to grant telestroke privileges to trainees.","Hajighasemi, M.; Quinn, J.; Paletz, L. B.; Song, S. S.; Schlick, K.; Lyden, P. D.",Stroke,,415

It is believed that sufficient supplies and equitable allocations of vaccines are necessary to limit the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the emergence of additional variants of concern. We have developed a COVID-19 vaccine based on Newcastle disease virus (NDV) that can be manufactured at high yields in embryonated eggs. Here we provide evidence that the NDV vector expressing an optimized spike antigen (NDV-HXP-S), upgraded from our previous construct, is a versatile vaccine that can be used live or inactivated to induce strong antibody responses and to also cross-neutralize variants of concern. The immunity conferred by NDV-HXP-S effectively counteracts SARS-CoV-2 infection in mice and hamsters. It is noteworthy that vaccine lots produced by existing egg-based influenza virus vaccine manufacturers in Vietnam, Thailand and Brazil exhibited excellent immunogenicity and efficacy in hamsters, demonstrating that NDV-HXP-S vaccines can be quickly produced at large-scale to meet global demands.","Sun, Weina; Liu, Yonghong; Amanat, Fatima; Gonzalez-Dominguez, Irene; McCroskery, Stephen; Slamanig, Stefan; Coughlan, Lynda; Rosado, Victoria; Lemus, Nicholas; Jangra, Sonia; Rathnasinghe, Raveen; Schotsaert, Michael; Martinez, Jose; Sano, Kaori; Mena, Ignacio; Innis, Bruce L.; Wirachwong, Ponthip; Thai, Duong Huu; Oliveira, Ricardo Das Neves; Scharf, Rami; Hjorth, Richard; Raghunandan, Rama; Krammer, Florian; Garcia-Sastre, Adolfo; Palese, Peter",,,415

The outbreak of COVID-19 began in December 2019, at the same time as the influenza season. However, as the treatments and prognoses of COVID-19 and influenza are different, it is important to accurately differentiate these two different respiratory tract infections on the basis of their respective early-stage characteristics. We reviewed official documents and news released by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC), the United States CDC, and the World Health Organization (WHO), and we also searched the PubMed, Web of Science, Excerpta Medica database (Embase), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang, preprinted bioRxiv and medRxiv databases for documents and guidelines from earliest available date up until October 3rd, 2020. We obtained the latest information about COVID-19 and influenza and summarized and compared their biological characteristics, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, pathological mechanisms, treatments, and prognostic factors. We show that although COVID-19 and influenza are different in many ways, there are numerous similarities; thus, in addition to using nucleic acid-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and antibody-based approaches, clinicians and epidemiologists should distinguish between the two using their respective characteristics in early stages. We should utilize experiences from other epidemics to provide additional guidance for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19.","Bai, Yu; Tao, Xiaonan",J Zhejiang Univ Sci B,,415

Stability constants for the ß-cyclodextrin complex ranged from 14,800 to 46,000 M-1, and the binding enthalpies were between -23.2 and -10.4 kJ/mole. Compared to water, the stability constant in seven carboxylic acid buffers (citric acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, succinic acid, malonic acid, malic acid and tartaric acid) was reduced. All seven buffers exhibited a competitive mechanism. Binding constants for the interaction between ß-cyclodextrin and buffers ranged from 4 to 44 M-1, and binding enthalpies were in the range -19 to -11 kJ/mole. There was a relation between the chemical structures of the buffers and their ability to bind to cyclodextrin. All seven buffers had a carbon chain longer than three carbons. Hydroxyl groups on the carbon chain decreased the binding affinity. 1H and ROESY NMR spectroscopy supported inclusion of the citric acid into the cyclodextrin cavity, although the results for succinic and maleic acids were ambiguous. The results demonstrated that some buffers can interact with cyclodextrin complexes, and careful considerations are necessary when choosing a buffer for cyclodextrin research.","Samuelsen, Lisa; Holm, René; Schönbeck, Christian",Int J Pharm,,415

Moreover, SAINT+ incorporates two temporal feature embeddings into the response embeddings: elapsed time, the time taken for a student to answer, and lag time, the time interval between adjacent learning activities. We empirically evaluate the effectiveness of SAINT+ on EdNet, the largest publicly available benchmark dataset in the education domain. Experimental results show that SAINT+ achieves state-of-the-art performance in knowledge tracing with an improvement of 1.25% in area under receiver operating characteristic curve compared to SAINT, the current state-of-the-art model in EdNet dataset.","Shin, Dongmin; Shim, Yugeun; Yu, Hangyeol; Lee, Seewoo; Kim, Byungsoo; Choi, Youngduck",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.12042v1.pdf,415

By performing a meta-analysis of two independent genome-wide association summary datasets (N = 680 128), a novel locus at 21q22.11 was identified to be associated with COVID-19 infection (rs9976829 in IFNAR2-IL10RB, odds ratio = 1.16, 95% confidence interval = 1.09-1.23, P = 2.57 × 10-6). The rs9976829 represents a strong splicing quantitative trait locus for both IFNAR2 and IL10RB genes, especially in lung tissue (P = 1.8 × 10-24). Integrative genomics analysis of combining genome-wide association study with expression quantitative trait locus data showed the expression variations of IFNAR2 and IL10RB have prominent effects on COVID-19 in various types of tissues, especially in lung tissue. The majority of IFNAR2-expressing cells were dendritic cells (40%) and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (38.5%), and IL10RB-expressing cells were mainly nonclassical monocytes (29.6%). IFNAR2 and IL10RB are targeted by several interferons-related drugs. Together, our results uncover 21q22.11 as a novel susceptibility locus for COVID-19, in which individuals with G alleles of rs9976829 have a higher probability of COVID-19 susceptibility than those with non-G alleles.","Ma, Yunlong; Huang, Yukuan; Zhao, Sen; Yao, Yinghao; Zhang, Yaru; Qu, Jia; Wu, Nan; Su, Jianzhong",Hum Mol Genet,,415
275885,Racial and/or Ethnic and Socioeconomic Disparities of SARS-CoV-2 Infection Among Children,2020,"There are important differences in the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and death depending on occupation. Infections in healthcare workers have received the most attention, and there are clearly increased risks for intensive care unit workers who are caring for COVID-19 patients. However, a number of other occupations may also be at an increased risk, particularly those which involve social care or contact with the public. A large number of data sets are available with the potential to assess occupational risks of COVID-19 incidence, severity, or mortality. We are reviewing these data sets as part of the Partnership for Research in Occupational, Transport, Environmental COVID Transmission (PROTECT) initiative, which is part of the National COVID-19 Core Studies. In this report, we review the data sets available (including the key variables on occupation and potential confounders) for examining occupational differences in SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 incidence, severity and mortality. We also discuss the possible types of analyses of these data sets and the definitions of (occupational) exposure and outcomes. We conclude that none of these data sets are ideal, and all have various strengths and weaknesses. For example, mortality data suffer from problems of coding of COVID-19 deaths, and the deaths (in England and Wales) that have been referred to the coroner are unavailable. On the other hand, testing data is heavily biased in some periods (particularly the first wave) because some occupations (e.g. healthcare workers) were tested more often than the general population. Random population surveys are, in principle, ideal for estimating population prevalence and incidence, but are also affected by non-response. Thus, any analysis of the risks in a particular occupation or sector (e.g. transport), will require a careful analysis and triangulation of findings across the various available data sets.","Pearce, N.; Rhodes, S.; Stocking, K.; Pembrey, L.; van Veldhoven, K.; Brickley, E.

276652,Detection of SARS CoV-2 contamination in the Operating Room and Birthing Room Setting: Risks to attending health care workers,2021,"The scholarly output of the new coronavirus research has been proliferating. During five months, an amount of 14,588 scientific publications about nCoV-2 and COVID-19 has been generated intensively (as indexed in Scopus on 31 May 2020). Such a knowledge outburst has created ample interest in understanding the research landscape of this newly configured area. This paper demonstrates on scientometric dimensions of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) research using quantifiable characteristics of the publication dataset. Findings reveal that the rate of publication growth (1600%) is very significant to a synergic response of the researchers to combat with the most extended sequence of an RNA virus. Indeed their response has geared up to an average of 100 articles per day. Many scholarly publishers have disclosed their preprint servers to make the publications available immediately, even by enabling Open Access. The scientific contents have published in more than 500 journals from 240 academic publishers. While the top-ten publishers occupied almost 70% of the articles, then about 25% of the studies were sponsored by 300 funding agencies. Among the notable journals Lancet, Nature, BMJ, JAMA, JMV, and NEJM are prominent. Findings also reveal that majority of the contributions have occurred in Medical Science, focusing on virology, immunology, epidemiology, pharmacology, public health, critical care, and emergency medicine. However, the closely associated terms are virus transmission, infection control, asymptomatic, quarantine, pneumonia, human, disease severity, clinical trials, viral pathogenesis, pandemic, risk, and mortality. The study suggests that academic hubs are located mostly in the USA, China, Italy, and the UK. Among the productive institutions; Huazhong Univ (China), Tongji Med. College (China), Harvard Med. School (USA), Univ of Milan (Italy), INSERM (France), UCL (UK) are outstanding. The G7 countries together produced 50% of the global research output on nCov-2. It also noted an encouraging trend of collaborative research across many countries and disciplines, where the values of CI (6.46), DC (0.79), and CC (0.59) are very significant. It examines the geographical diversity of the collaborating authors, thereby visualized their linkages via co-authorship occurrences. Finally, it analyzed the publications' impact to showcase the most influential contributions of the new coronavirus research.","Pal, Jiban K",Scientometrics,,415

National health care systems have reorganized to cope with the disease. Surgical services departments around the world have been affected and elective surgical procedures have been postponed to conserve medical resources. When a patient with COVID-19 requires an urgent microsurgical free flap due to trauma or a tumor, personnel from the health care facility must have a protocol in place to follow for the patient's care and follow-up. In this article, we present our protocol for patients with COVID-19 requiring reconstructive microsurgery.","Thione, Alessandro; Sánchez-García, Alberto; Pérez-García, Alberto; García-Vilariño, Elena; Salmerón-González, Enrique; Balaguer-Cambra, Jorge",Plast Surg Nurs,,415
277912,"Proposed Individual Risk Score for Educational Institutions Utilizing Risk of Morbidity/Mortality by SARS-CoV-2, Occupational Exposure, and Type of Transportation",2020,"Autonomous machines are poised to become pervasive, but most treat machines differently: we are willing to violate social norms and less likely to display altruism toward machines. Here, we report an unexpected effect that those impacted by Covid-19 -as measured by a Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder scale- show a sharp reduction in this difference. Participants engaged in the dictator game with humans and machines and, consistent with prior research on disasters, those impacted by Covid-19 displayed more altruism to other humans. Unexpectedly, participants impacted by Covid-19 displayed equal altruism toward human and machine partners. A mediation analysis suggests that altruism toward machines was explained by an increase in heuristic thinking -reinforcing prior theory that heuristic thinking encourages people to treat machines like people- and faith in technology -perhaps reflecting longer-term consequences on how we act with machines. These findings give insight, but also raise concerns, for the design of technology.","de Melo, Celso M; Gratch, Jonathan; Krueger, Frank",iScience,,415

Abbott ID NOW provides fast results but has been criticized for low sensitivity. Here we determine the sensitivity of ID NOW in an ambulatory population presented for testing. The study enrolled 785 symptomatic patients, of whom 21 were positive by both ID NOW and RT-PCR, and 2 only by RT-PCR. All 189 asymptomatic patients tested negative. The positive percent agreement between the ID NOW assay and the RT-PCR assay was 91.3%, and negative percent agreement was 100%. The results from the current study were included into a larger systematic review of literature where at least 20 subjects were simultaneously tested using ID NOW and RT-PCR. The overall sensitivity for ID NOW assay was calculated at 84% (95% confidence interval 55-96%) and had the highest correlation to RT-PCR at viral loads most likely to be associated with transmissible infections.","Tu, Yuan-Po; Iqbal, Jameel; O039,; Leary, Timothy",eLife (Cambridge),,415
278751,"Not sick enough to worry? ""Influenza-like"" symptoms and work-related behavior among healthcare workers and other professionals: Results of a global survey",2020,"OBJECTIVES: Epidemiological investigations and mathematical models have revealed that the rapid diffusion of Covid-19 can mostly be attributed to undetected infective individuals who continue to circulate and spread the disease: finding their number would be of great importance in the control of the epidemic. METHODS: The dynamics of an infection can be described by the SIR model, which divides the population into susceptible (S), infective I, and removed R subjects. In particular, we exploited the Kermack-McKendrick epidemic model, which can be applied when the population is much larger than the fraction of infected subjects. RESULTS: We proved that the fraction of undetected infectives, compared to the total number of infected subjects, is given by 1-1R0, where R0 is the basic reproduction number. The mean value R0=2.102.09-2.11 for the Covid-19 epidemic in three Italian regions yielded a percentage of undetected infectives of 52.4% (52.2%-52.6%) compared to the total number of infectives. CONCLUSIONS: Our results, straightforwardly obtained from the SIR model, highlight the role of undetected carriers in the transmission and spread of the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Such evidence strongly recommends careful monitoring of the infective population and ongoing adjustment of preventive measures for disease control until a vaccine becomes available for most of the population.","Melis, Maurizio; Littera, Roberto",Int J Infect Dis,,415

The missing piece to understand SARS-CoV-2 infection in children?,2021,"PURPOSE: Opioid use is associated with gastrointestinal adverse events, including nausea and constipation. We used a real-world dataset to characterize the health care burden associated with opioid-induced constipation (OIC) with particular emphasis on strong opioids. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was conducted using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink, a large UK primary care dataset linked to hospital data. Patients prescribed opioids during 2016 were selected and episodes of opioid therapy constructed. Episodes with &#8805;84 days of exposure were classified as chronic, with date of first prescription as the index date. The main analysis focused on patients prescribed strong opioids who were laxative naive. Constipation was defined by &#8805;2 laxative prescriptions during the opioid episode. Patients for whom initial laxative therapy escalated by switch, augmentation, or dose were defined as OIC unstable, and the first 3 lines of OIC escalation were classified. Health care costs accrued in the first 12 months of the opioid episode were aggregated and compared. FINDINGS: A total of 27,629 opioid episodes were identified; 5916 (21.4%) involved a strong opioid for patients who were previously laxative naive. Of these patients, 2886 (48.8%) were defined as the OIC population; 941 (33.26%) were classified as stable. Of the 1945 (67.4%) episodes classified as unstable, 849 (43.7%), 360 (18.5%), and 736 (37.8%) had 1, 2, and &#8805;3 changes of laxative prescription, respectively. Patients without OIC had lower costs per patient year (£3822 [US$5160/4242]) compared with OIC (£4786 [US$6461/5312]). Costs increased as patients had multiple changes in therapy: £4696 (US$6340/5213), £4749 (US$6411/5271), and £4981 (US$6724/5529) for 1, 2, and &#8805;3 changes, respectively. The adjusted cost ratio relative to non-OIC was 1.14 (95% CI, 1.09-1.32) for those classified as stable and 1.19 (95% CI, 1.09-1.32) for those with &#8805;3 laxative changes. Similar patterns were observed for patients taking anyopioid, with costs increased for those classified as having OIC (£3727 [US$5031/4137] vs £2379 [US$3212 /2641),and for those patients classified as unstable versus stable (£3931 [US$5307/4363] vs £3432 [US$4633/3810). Costs increased with each additional line of therapy from £3701 (US$4996/4108), £3916 (US$5287/4347), and £4318 (US$5829/4793). IMPLICATIONS: OIC was a common adverse event of opioid treatment and was poorly controlled for a large number of patients. Poor control was associated with increased health care costs. The impact of OIC should be considered when prescribing opioids. These results should be interpreted with consideration of the caveats associated with the analysis of routine data.","Morgan, Christopher Ll; Jenkins-Jones, Sara; Knaggs, Roger; Currie, Craig; Conway, Peter; Poole, Chris D; Berni, Ellen",Clin. ther,,415

Calcifediol can rapidly increase serum 25OHD concentration. We therefore evaluated the effect of calcifediol treatment, on Intensive Care Unit Admission and Mortality rate among Spanish patients hospitalized for COVID-19. DESIGN: Parallel pilot randomized open label, double-masked clinical trial. SETTING: University hospital setting (Reina Sofia University Hospital, Córdoba Spain.) PARTICIPANTS: 76 consecutive patients hospitalized with COVID-19 infection, clinical picture of acute respiratory infection, confirmed by a radiographic pattern of viral pneumonia and by a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR with CURB65 severity scale (recommending hospital admission in case of total score > 1). PROCEDURES: All hospitalized patients received as best available therapy the same standard care, (per hospital protocol), of a combination of hydroxychloroquine (400 mg every 12 h on the first day, and 200 mg every 12 h for the following 5 days), azithromycin (500 mg orally for 5 days. Eligible patients were allocated at a 2 calcifediol:1 no calcifediol ratio through electronic randomization on the day of admission to take oral calcifediol (0.532 mg), or not. Patients in the calcifediol treatment group continued with oral calcifediol (0.266 mg) on day 3 and 7, and then weekly until discharge or ICU admission. Outcomes of effectiveness included rate of ICU admission and deaths. RESULTS: Of 50 patients treated with calcifediol, one required admission to the ICU (2%), while of 26 untreated patients, 13 required admission (50 %) p value X2 Fischer test p < 0.001. Univariate Risk Estimate Odds Ratio for ICU in patients with Calcifediol treatment versus without Calcifediol treatment: 0.02 (95 %CI 0.002-0.17). Multivariate Risk Estimate Odds Ratio for ICU in patients with Calcifediol treatment vs Without Calcifediol treatment ICU (adjusting by Hypertension and T2DM): 0.03 (95 %CI: 0.003-0.25). Of the patients treated with calcifediol, none died, and all were discharged, without complications. The 13 patients not treated with calcifediol, who were not admitted to the ICU, were discharged. Of the 13 patients admitted to the ICU, two died and the remaining 11 were discharged. CONCLUSION: Our pilot study demonstrated that administration of a high dose of Calcifediol or 25-hydroxyvitamin D, a main metabolite of vitamin D endocrine system, significantly reduced the need for ICU treatment of patients requiring hospitalization due to proven COVID-19. Calcifediol seems to be able to reduce severity of the disease, but larger trials with groups properly matched will be required to show a definitive answer.","Entrenas Castillo, Marta; Entrenas Costa, Luis Manuel; Vaquero Barrios, José Manuel; Alcalá Díaz, Juan Francisco; López Miranda, José; Bouillon, Roger; Quesada Gomez, José Manuel",J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol,,415
282103,SARS-CoV-2 associated with death in an infant with congenital chylothorax,2021,"An outbreak of the so-called Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been spreading rapidly nationwide in China since December 2019. Wuhan, Hubei Province, is the hardest-hit region, with a rise in confirmed cases and its hospitals overwhelmed. On 2nd February, 2020, Wuhan began to build a modular hospital to treat patients caught with mild illness. The mobile modular hospital is mainly composed of medical modules, technical support modules, ward units, living support units and transportation capacity under field conditions, and there are complete equipment and specialized personnel to treat patients. Due to the severity and particularity of SARS-CoV-2, taking granted from lessons learnt from mobile modular hospitals, we use the existing large venues to construct a new fixed modular hospital. As patients need to be treated and tested, it is important to develop a clinical laboratory in the modular hospital and ensure biosafety. The construction of a clinical laboratory in the modular hospital is faced with problems such as time pressure, limited site selection, high level of biosafety, lack of experience and so forth. This paper mainly discusses how to construct the clinical laboratory in the modular hospital quickly and safely and put it into use to provide testing service for patients under various limited conditions.","Yusong, Liu; Duanliang, Peng; Jia, Yang; Dunyan, Chen; Hongbing, Jia; Siyuan, Yu; Huanhuan, Chen; Juan, Zhao; Lyurong, Liu",Clin Chem Lab Med,,415

METHODS: We used ARIMA modeling to predict two time series as a function of independent variables. RESULTS: We found significant prediction of time series in both models, but campaign expenditure only predicted use of a campaign web tool whereas weekly news stories predicted online searches regarding aspirin and the heart originating from Minnesota. CONCLUSION: Patient information engagement is a function of information salience at least in part. Campaign advertising expenditure can prompt audience use of campaign tools but news coverage also operates as an important force on patient search behavior. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Health promotion professionals charged with reaching patients with heart health and stroke prevention messages should monitor news coverage as a potential complementary or rival force while at the same time promoting campaign-related information online.","Southwell, Brian G; Eder, Milton; Finnegan, John; Luepker, Russell V; Duval, Sue; Russell, Carol; Graves, Robert N; Namboodri, Adele",Patient educ. couns,,415

It also identifies factors that explain the perceived effect of COVID-19 on the companies' performance. To do this, we used a survey data covering 122 micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) and micro, small, and medium industry (MSMIs) in four communes in Benin. Firstly, we computed the annual rate change in quarterly turnover to capture the effect of the COVID-19. Secondly, a multiple regression was estimated to identify factors explaining the perceived effect of the COVID-19 on the exporting companies. We found that the exporting companies experience on average a 53.308% drop in quarterly turnover in 2020 probably due to the COVID-19 crisis. Based on the forecasts, the results also revealed a very slow recovery in activities but the rate of change will remain negative until 2021 if nothing is done to support the MSMEs/MSMIs. Finally, we found that the perceived effect of the COVID-19 depends on the level of education of head of the companies, on the experience in exportation, and on the organization of the work because of the pandemic. Our findings suggest the necessity for public policy support toward the MSMEs/MSMIs to contain the effect of the pandemic in Benin.","Chabossou, Augustin F C; Nonvide, Gbêtondji Melaine Armel; Lokonon, Boris O K; Amegnaglo, Cocou Jaurès; Akpo, Laurent G",Eur J Dev Res,,415

Yet, little is known about mental health status during COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to measure the prevalence of mental health disorders among patients with rheumatic diseases in the era of COVID-19 pandemic and to determine potential risk factors for major symptoms of depression, anxiety, and insomnia in participants. METHODS: Participants with rheumatic diseases were asked to complete a questionnaire using a telephonic interview. Sociodemographic and rheumatic disease characteristics were recorded. Mental health status was assessed by the patient health questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)-7, and insomnia severity index (ISI) questionnaires to detect depression, anxiety and insomnia symptoms, respectively. RESULTS: We included 307 patients in the survey. Rheumatoid arthritis was the most frequent diagnosis (55%). Of all participants, 7.5% had known depression and 5.5% known anxiety. Mental health disorders were insomnia (34.9%), anxiety (33.2%), and depression (24.4%). Major symptoms of insomnia, anxiety, and depression were noted in respectively, 19.9%, 12.4%, and 7.8% of participants. Risk factors for major insomnia were male gender (OR= 4.36, 95% CI 2.06 to 9.25; p<0.0001), low socioeconomic status (OR= 2.64, 95% CI 1.44 - 4.83; p<0.002) and having rheumatoid arthritis (OR= 2.00, 95% CI 1.04 to 3.84; p<0.036). Major anxiety was associated with low monthly income (OR=1.79, 95% CI 1.07 to 3.01; p<0.026), and higher Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) of pain (OR=1.795, 95% CI 1.074 to 2.994 ; p<0.026). Major depression was associated with worsening of rheumatic disease (OR=1.86, 95% CI 1.06 to 3.26; p<0.03).

In a fourth cohort of COVID-19 patients in which GI biopsies were obtained, we identified severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) within small intestinal enterocytes for the first time in vivo but failed to obtain culturable virus. High dimensional analyses of GI tissues confirmed low levels of cellular inflammation in the GI lamina propria and an active downregulation of key inflammatory genes including IFNG, CXCL8, CXCL2 and IL1B among others.

294756,Immunopathological mechanisms involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection,2020,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to personal protective equipment (PPE) shortages, requiring mask reuse or improvisation. We provide a review of medical-grade facial protection (surgical masks, N95 respirators and face shields) for healthcare workers, the safety and efficacy of decontamination methods, and the utility of alternative strategies in emergency shortages or resource-scarce settings. METHODS: We conducted a scoping review of PubMed and grey literature related to facial protection and potential adaptation strategies in the setting of PPE shortages (January 2000 to March 2020). Limitations included few COVID-19-specific studies and exclusion of non-English language articles. We conducted a narrative synthesis of the evidence based on relevant healthcare settings to increase practical utility in decision-making. RESULTS: We retrieved 5462 peer-reviewed articles and 41 grey literature records. In total, we included 67 records which met inclusion criteria. Compared with surgical masks, N95 respirators perform better in laboratory testing, may provide superior protection in inpatient settings and perform equivalently in outpatient settings. Surgical mask and N95 respirator conservation strategies include extended use, reuse or decontamination, but these strategies may result in inferior protection. Limited evidence suggests that reused and improvised masks should be used when medical-grade protection is unavailable. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to critical shortages of medical-grade PPE. Alternative forms of facial protection offer inferior protection. More robust evidence is required on different types of medical-grade facial protection. As research on COVID-19 advances, investigators should continue to examine the impact on alternatives of medical-grade facial protection.","Garcia Godoy, Laura R; Jones, Amy E; Anderson, Taylor N; Fisher, Cameron L; Seeley, Kylie M L; Beeson, Erynn A; Zane, Hannah K; Peterson, Jaime W; Sullivan, Peter D",,,415

296625,"SARS-CoV-2, a novel virus with an unusual cardiac feature: inverted takotsubo syndrome",2020,"The novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19) is caused by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and is characterized by an exaggerated inflammatory response that can lead to severe manifestations such as adult respiratory syndrome, sepsis, coagulopathy, and death in a proportion of patients. Among other factors and direct viral effects, the increase in the vasoconstrictor angiotensin II, the decrease in the vasodilator angiotensin, and the sepsis-induced release of cytokines can trigger a coagulopathy in COVID-19. A coagulopathy has been reported in up to 50% of patients with severe COVID-19 manifestations. An increase in d-dimer is the most significant change in coagulation parameters in severe COVID-19 patients, and progressively increasing values can be used as a prognostic parameter indicating a worse outcome. Limited data suggest a high incidence of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in up to 40% of patients, despite the use of a standard dose of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) in most cases. In addition, pulmonary microvascular thrombosis has been reported and may play a role in progressive lung failure. Prophylactic LMWH has been recommended by the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) and the American Society of Hematology (ASH), but the best effective dosage is uncertain. Adapted to the individual risk of thrombosis and the d-dimer value, higher doses can be considered, especially since bleeding events in COVID-19 are rare. Besides the anticoagulant effect of LMWH, nonanticoagulant properties such as the reduction in interleukin 6 release have been shown to improve the complex picture of coagulopathy in patients with COVID-19.","Miesbach, Wolfgang; Makris, Michael",Clin Appl Thromb Hemost,,415

METHODS: This was a retrospective chart review of 263 COVID-19 positive patients requiring intubation in the intensive care units at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital and MedStar Washington Hospital Center between March 1st and July 26th, 2020. Information regarding proning status, duration of proning, presence, or absence of facial pressure injuries and interventions were collected. Paired two-tailed t-test was used to evaluate differences between proned patients who developed pressure injuries with those who did not. RESULTS: Overall, 143 COVID-19 positive patients required proning while intubated with the average duration of proning being 5.15 days. Of those proned, 68 (47.6%) developed a facial pressure injury. The most common site involved was the cheek with a total of 57 (84%) followed by ears (50%). The average duration of proning for patients who developed a pressure injury was significantly longer when compared to those who did not develop pressure injuries (6.79 days vs. 3.64 days, P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Facial pressure injuries occur with high incidence in patients with COVID-19 who undergo prone positioning. Longer duration of proning appears to confer greater risk for developing these pressure injuries. Hence, improved preventative measures and early interventions are needed.

Participants report biopsychosocial benefits, however, research on impact is limited. The 'SLH: Improving Experiences of Lung Disease trial', a randomised controlled, single (assessor) blind, trial of 12 weeks SLH versus usual care for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (n=120) was setup to help to address this. The first group (n=18, nine singing and nine controls) started face-to-face (five sessions) before changing to online delivery (seven sessions) due to COVID-19-related physical distancing measures. As such, the experience of this group is here reported as a pilot study to inform further research in this area. METHODS: We conducted semistructured interviews and thematic analysis regarding barriers, facilitators and key considerations for transitioning from face-to-face to online delivery. Pilot quantitative outcomes include attendance, premeasures and postmeasures of quality of life and disease impact (Short Form 36 Health Survey, COPD Assessment Test score), breathlessness (Medical Research Council breathlessness scale, Dyspnoea-12), depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9, PHQ-9), anxiety (Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7), balance confidence (Activity specific Balance Confidence, ABC scale) and physical activity (clinical visit PROactive physical activity in COPD tool, combining subjective rating and actigraphy). RESULTS: Attendance was 69% overall, (90% of the face-to-face sessions, 53% online sessions). Analysis of semistructured interviews identified three themes regarding participation in SLH delivered face to face and online, these where (1) perceived benefits; (2) digital barriers (online) and (3) digital facilitators (online). Findings were summarised into key considerations for optimising transitioning singing groups from face-to-face to online delivery. Pilot quantitative data suggested possible improvements in depression (treatment effect -4.78 PHQ-9 points, p<0.05, MCID 5) and balance confidence (treatment effect +17.21 ABC scale points, p=0.04, MCID 14.2). DISCUSSION: This study identifies key considerations regarding the adaptation of SLH from face-to-face to online delivery. Pilot data suggest online group singing for people with COPD may deliver benefits related to reducing depression and improved balance confidence.","Philip, Keir Ej; Lewis, Adam; Jeffery, Edmund; Buttery, Sara; Cave, Phoene; Cristiano, Daniele; Lound, Adam; Taylor, Karen; Man, William D-C; Fancourt, Daisy; Polkey, Michael I; Hopkinson, Nicholas S",,,415
299635,"Epidemiology, Clinical Features and Prognostic Factors of Pediatric SARS-CoV-2 Infection: Results From an Italian Multicenter Study",2021,"Integrative data analysis (IDA) jointly models participant-level data from multiple studies. In psychology, IDA has been conducted using different fixed-effects and multilevel modeling (MLM) approaches. However, evaluations regarding the performance of these models in an IDA context are limited. The goal of this article is to evaluate three fixed-effects models (aggregated vs. disaggregated vs. study-specific coefficients regressions) and two MLMs (fixed-slope vs. random-slopes MLM) for cross-sectional IDA. Using a simulation study with study sample sizes and numbers of studies consistent with applied IDA (e.g., two to 35 studies), we evaluated estimation bias and type I error rates for participant-level and study-level effects and variance components for these models; for the MLMs, we evaluated different estimation methods (i.e., constrained vs. unconstrained variance estimation and five degrees of freedom methods). Disaggregated and study-specific coefficients regressions and both MLMs yielded fixed effects estimates with ignorable bias, but only the random-slopes MLM fully modeled between-study heterogeneity and, consequently, provided well-controlled type I error rates for testing both fixed effects. Overall, we found that MLMs could be feasible under IDA conditions with three to six studies and well-chosen estimation methods. A real-data IDA example is used to illustrate and compare the application of the five models. We hope our results will help researchers choose appropriate modeling methods when conducting IDA.

As a junior doctor working closely with patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, I was aware of my personal risk of exposure to the virus. I assumed that as a fit and well 26-year-old with no comorbidities, if I were to become infected, it was unlikely that COVID-19 would be severe. However, I became critically unwell following a week of clinical work, necessitating hospital admission, tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. I remained mechanically ventilated for 6 days and was then transferred to a medical ward 2 days later. After two further days of rehabilitation, I was discharged home. This reflection is not a junior doctor’s view of how COVID-19 was managed by the NHS, but a personal view of my illness from ‘the other side of the curtain’. My reflections focus upon the psychological aspects of my experiences, exploring the memories that I formed around the time of critical care, how the fears that I possessed were managed with exceptional communication, and the importance of the wider healthcare team in my recovery.","Ramachandran, S.",Anesth.

CREST2 is comparing intensive medical management alone versus intensive medical management plus revascularization with endarterectomy or stenting. We performed a study to evaluate the feasibility of a home-based program for testing blood pressure (BP) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) in CREST2. METHODS: This study involved 45 patients at 10 sites in the CREST2 trial. The initial patients were identified by the Medical Management Core (MMC) as high-risk patients defined by stage 2 hypertension, LDL > 90 mg/dl, or both. If a patient at the site declined participation, another was substituted. All patients who agreed to participate were sent a BP monitoring device and a commercially available at-home lipid test kit that uses a self-performed finger-stick blood sample that was resulted to the patient. Training on the use of the equipment and obtaining the risk factor results was done by the study coordinator by telephone. RESULTS: Ten of the 130 currently active CREST2 sites participated, 8 in the LDL portion and 5 in the BP portion (3 sites did both). Twenty-six BP devices and 23 lipid tests were sent to patients. Of the 26 patients who obtained BP readings with the devices, 9 were out of the study target and adjustments in BP medications were made in 3. Of the 23 patients sent LDL tests, 13 were able to perform the test showing 7 were out of target, leading to adjustments in lipid medications in 4. CONCLUSION: This study established the feasibility of at-home monitoring of BP and LDL in a clinical trial and identified implementation challenges prior to widespread use in the trial.

300353,Health Indicators in Hospitalized Patients With SARS-CoV-2 Pneumonia: A Comparison Between the First and Second Wave,2021,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 pandemic is caused by coronavirus that is also known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The viral infection continues to impact the globe with no vaccine to prevent the infection or highly effective therapeutics to treat the millions of infected people around the world. The disease starts as a respiratory infection, yet it may also be associated with a hypercoagulable state, severe inflammation owing to excessive cytokines production, and a potentially significant oxidative stress. The disease may progress to multiorgan failure and eventually death. OBJECTIVE: In this article, we summarize the potential of dipyridamole as an adjunct therapy for COVID-19. METHODS: We reviewed the literature describing the biological activities of dipyridamole in various settings of testing. Data were retrieved from PubMed, SciFinder-CAS, and Web of Science. The review concisely covered relevant studies starting 1977. RESULTS: Dipyridamole is an approved antiplatelet drug, that has been used to prevent stroke, among other indications. Besides its antithrombotic activity, the literature indicates that dipyridamole also promotes a host of other biological activities including antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant ones. CONCLUSION: Dipyridamole may substantially help improve the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 treatment. The pharmacokinetics profile of the drug is well established which makes it easier to design an appropriate therapeutic course. The drug is also generally safe, affordable, and available worldwide. Initial clinical trials have shown a substantial promise for dipyridamole in treating critically ill COVID-19 patients, yet larger randomized and controlled trials are needed to confirm this promise.","Aliter, Kholoud F; Al-Horani, Rami A",Curr. pharm. des,,415

This study also explores the possible laboratory characteristics used for prognostication in patients with NSCLC and COVID-19. Additionally, this study evaluated potential differences in laboratory values between the case and control groups. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a single-center retrospective cohort study conducted in Dharmais National Cancer Hospital, Indonesia, enrolling patients with NSCLC undergoing chemotherapy or targeted therapy between May 2020 and January 2021. All patients with NSCLC and COVID-19 in these periods were enrolled into the case group. The control group was age-matched NSCLC patients without COVID-19 that was derived from the NSCLC cohort through randomization. RESULTS: There were 342 patients with NSCLC between May 2020 and January 2021. Twenty-seven (7.9%) of the patients were infected by COVID-19. To facilitate comparison, thirty-five age-matched controls with NSCLC were selected from the cohort. The mortality rate in patients with COVID-19 was 46.2%. Eleven patients (40.7%) had severe COVID-19, of which none survived. NLR >8.35 has a sensitivity of 83.3%, specificity of 92.9%, LR+ of 12, and LR- of 0.18.

It can be subdivided into three major classifications based on the component of the neuromuscular system (i.e. peripheral nerves or skeletal muscle or both) that are affected. This includes critical illness polyneuropathy (CIP), critical illness myopathy (CIM), and an overlap syndrome, critical illness polyneuromyopathy (CIPNM). It is a common complication observed in people with critical illness requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Given CIAW is found in individuals experiencing grave illness, it can be challenging to study from a practical standpoint. However, over the past 2 decades, many insights into the pathophysiology of this condition have been made. Results from studies in both humans and animal models have found that a profound systemic inflammatory response and factors related to bioenergetic failure as well as microvascular, metabolic, and electrophysiological alterations underlie the development of CIAW. Current management strategies focus on early mobilization, achieving euglycemia, and nutritional optimization. Other interventions lack sufficient evidence, mainly due to a dearth of large trials. The goal of this Physiology in Medicine article is to highlight important aspects of the pathophysiology of these enigmatic conditions. It is hoped that improved understanding of the mechanisms underlying these disorders will lead to further study and new investigations for novel pharmacologic, nutritional, and exercise-based interventions to optimize patient outcomes.","Cheung, Kevin; Rathbone, Alasdair; Melanson, Michel; Trier, Jessica; Ritsma, Benjamin R; Allen, Matti D",J Appl Physiol (1985),,415

As the course of the COVID-19 pandemic changes, we explore the US public sentiments on resuming previously postponed elective plastic surgery procedures. Methods: A prospective national survey of one thousand US adults was conducted to study public perception of elective plastic surgery procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic. Binomial logarithmic multivariable regression modeling was employed to study the response data. Results: Nine hundred seventy-three participants were included in study. The majority (86.6%) believed elective plastic surgery should continue during the COVID-19 pandemic. Most (79.6%) would not delay obtaining plastic surgery more than 6 months. Participants expressed concerns of contracting COVID-19 at elective surgery centers (67.5%) or at hospitals (68.5%). Participants who reside in the Midwest (odds ratio [OR] 2.3, P &lt; 0.05) and participants between the ages of 41 and 60 years old (OR 2.8, P &lt; 0.03) were more likely to resume elective plastic surgery.

As such, there is a public health interest in social distancing compliance. The available evidence on distancing practices in public space is limited, however, by the lack of observational data. Here, we apply video observation as a method to examine to what extent members of the public comply with social distancing directives. DATA: Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) footage of interactions in public was collected in inner-city Amsterdam, the Netherlands. From the footage, we observed instances of people violating the 1.5-meter distance directives in the weeks before, during, and after these directives were introduced to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: We find that people complied with the 1.5-meter distance directives when these directives were first introduced, but that the level of compliance started to decline soon after. We also find that violation of the 1.5-meter distance directives is strongly associated with the number of people observed on the street and with non-compliance to stay-at-home directives, operationalized with large-scale aggregated location data from cell phones. All three measures correlate to a varying extent with temporal patterns in the transmission of the COVID-19 virus, temperature, COVID-19 related Google search queries, and media attention to the topic. CONCLUSION: Compliance with 1.5 meter distance directives is short-lived and coincides with the number of people on the street and with compliance to stay-at-home directives. Potential implications of these findings are that keep- distance directives may work best in combination with stay-at-home directives and place-specific crowd-control strategies, and that the number of people on the street and community-wide mobility as captured with cell phone data offer easily measurable proxies for the extent to which people keep sufficient physical distance from others at specific times and locations.","Hoeben, Evelien M; Bernasco, Wim; Suonperä Liebst, Lasse; van Baak, Carlijn; Rosenkrantz Lindegaard, Marie",PLoS One,,415

The three liquids display a Newtonian plateau followed by a shear thinning regime at shear rates of the order of GHz. Even though the main features of the liquid structure remains under shear, systematic changes were noticed at the GHz rates, with coordination shells becoming more diffuse as noticed by the reduction in the difference between consecutive maxima and minima in the radial distribution function. Interestingly, these structural changes with the shear rate can be precisely fitted using the Carreau equation, which is a well-known expression for the shear rate dependence of the viscosity. The fitting parameters for different distributions can be used to explain qualitatively the shear thinning behavior of these liquids.

307964,Mind long COVID: Psychiatric sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection,2021,"BACKGROUND: The clinical course of COVID-19 may vary significantly. The presence of comorbidities prolongs the recovery time. The recovery in patients with mild-to-moderate symptoms might take 10 days, while in those with a critical illness or immunocompromised status could take 15 days. Considering the lack of data about predictors that could affect the recovery time, we conducted this study to identify them. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was implemented in the COVID-19 clinic of a teaching and referral university hospital in Tehran. Patients with the highly suggestive symptoms who had computed tomography (CT) imaging results with typical findings of COVID-19 or positive results of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were enrolled in the study. Inpatient and outpatient COVID-19 participants were followed up by regular visits or phone calls, and the recovery period was recorded. RESULTS: A total of 478 patients were enrolled. The mean age of patients was 54.11 ± 5.65 years, and 44.2% were female. The median time to recovery was 13.5 days (IQR: 9). Although in the bivariate analysis, multiple factors, including hypertension, fever, diabetes mellitus, gender, and admission location, significantly contributed to prolonging the recovery period, in multivariate analysis, only dyspnea had a significant association with this variable (p = 0.02, the adjusted OR of 2.05; 95% CI 1.12-3.75). CONCLUSION: This study supports that dyspnea is a predictor of recovery time. It seems like optimal management of the comorbidities plays the most crucial role in recovery from COVID-19.","SeyedAlinaghi, SeyedAhmad; Abbasian, Ladan; Solduzian, Mohammad; Ayoobi Yazdi, Niloofar; Jafari, Fatemeh; Adibimehr, Alireza; Farahani, Aazam; Salami Khaneshan, Arezoo; Ebrahimi Alavijeh, Parvaneh; Jahani, Zahra; Karimian, Elnaz; Ahmadinejad, Zahra; Khalili, Hossein; Seifi, Arash; Ghiasvand, Fereshteh; Ghaderkhani, Sara; Rasoolinejad, Mehrnaz",Eur J Med Res,,415

308546,Frailty and SARS-CoV-2 infection. A population-based study in a highly endemic village,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Pneumonia is one of the leading complications and causes of death after a spinal cord injury (SCI). After a cervical or thoracic lesion, impairment of the respiratory muscles decreases respiratory function, which increases the risk of respiratory complications. Pneumonia substantially reduces patient's quality of life, may prolong inpatient rehabilitation time, increase healthcare costs or at worse, lead to early death. Respiratory function and coughing can be improved through various interventions after SCI, but the available evidence as to which aspect of respiratory care should be optimised is inconclusive. Furthermore, ability of respiratory function parameters to predict pneumonia risk is insufficiently established. This paper details the protocol for a large-scale, multicentre research project that aims to evaluate the ability of parameters of respiratory function to predict and understand variation in inpatient risk of pneumonia in SCI. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: RESCOM, a prospective cohort study, began recruitment in October 2016 across 10 SCI rehabilitation centres from Australia, Austria, Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland. Inpatients with acute SCI, with complete or incomplete cervical or thoracic lesions, 18 years or older and not/no more dependent on 24-hour mechanical ventilation within the first 3 months after injury are eligible for inclusion. The target sample size is 500 participants. The primary outcome is an occurrence of pneumonia; secondary outcomes include pneumonia-related mortality and quality of life. We will use the longitudinal data for prognostic models on inpatient pneumonia risk factors. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has been reviewed and approved by all local ethics committees of all participating centres. Study results will be disseminated to the scientific community through peer-reviewed journals and conference presentations, to the SCI community, other stakeholders and via social media, newsletters and engagement activities.

The aim of this study was to describe the characteristics and outcomes among confirmed COVID-19 cases who were managed at three settings: two outpatient settings and one inpatient. METHODS: A retrospective database cohort study was conducted in a large Israeli Health Maintenance Organization. All COVID-19 cases diagnosed between 28 February 2020 and 20 July 2020 were included. Cases in the community settings were managed through a nationwide remote monitoring center, using preliminary telehealth triage and 24/7 virtual care. Outcome parameters included hospital admission, disease severity, need for respiratory support and mortality. RESULTS: About 5448 cases, aged range 0-97 years, were enrolled; 88.7% were initially managed as outpatient either at home or in designated hotels, 3.1 and 2.1% of them, respectively, later required hospitalization. The main reason for hospitalization was dyspnea; 12 were diagnosed with severe disease; 56 patients (1.3%) died, five (0.1%) of whom were initially allocated to the outpatient settings. CONCLUSIONS: Care for appropriately selected COVID-19 patients in the community provides a safe and effective option. This can contribute to reducing the hospitalization burden, with no evidence of increased morbidity or mortality.","Shapiro Ben David, Shirley; Cohen, Daniella; Karplus, Rebekah; Irony, Angela; Ofer-Bialer, Gili; Potasman, Israel; Greenfeld, Orly; Azuri, Joseph; Ash, Nachman",J. public health (Oxf),,415

311338,Association of Digestive Symptoms and Hospitalization in Patients With SARS-CoV-2 Infection,2020,"INTRODUCTION: In recent months, with the spread of COVID 19, the number of kidney transplants from deceased donors has declined significantly in most countries. One of the reasons is the possibility of infection of the recipient with SARS-CoV-2. Determining the risk of transmission of COVID 19 with a donor organ is very important for developing a kidney transplantation policy during a pandemic. MATERIAL AND METHOD: We present cases of kidney transplantation from COVID 19 positive deceased donor to two dialysis patients in single center. Deceased donor: a 45 years old man with diabetes, who had a major hemorrhagic stroke resulting in brain death. He had normal urine output and serum creatinine level for last 24 hours before kidney harvesting. For a few hours after organ harvesting, the donor was diagnosed COVID 19 (retrospective nasopharyngeal swab rRT-PCR which was confirmed by morphological examination and RNA-PCR of specimens from the trachea and bronchus). Recipient 1: a 49 years old man with polycystic kidney disease had been on hemodialysis for 28 months. He was in urgent list because of problems with vascular access. So non identical ABO (0-donor, B-recipient) kidney transplantation from this deceased donor was done in May 2020. Recipient 2: a 45 years old man with polycystic kidney disease on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). was registered on urgent waiting list because of low transport capacity of peritoneum. Kidney transplantation from the same deceased donor was done at the same time. In both cases we completely abandoned any antilymphocytic agents for induction, despite non ABO identical transplantation in one of the recipients and the delayed graft function. Both patients received only basic immunosuppression, including tacrolimus, methylprednisolone and a mycophenolic acid. RESULTS: In first case cold ischemia time was 22 hours. The recipient had delayed graft function with increasing of urine output on day 8 post-transplant. No other deviations from the usual course were seen during hospital stay. The patient was discharge from hospital with serum creatinine level 122 mkmol/L. The cold ischemia time was 21 hours in another patient. Graft function was immediate with a decrease serum creatinine to 92.5 mkmol/L at discharge. Both patients had no febrile and no other symptoms of acute respiratory disease during all hospital stay. No abnormalities on chest X-ray were seen. No serum anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG were detected before and during 6 weeks after surgery. Repeated nasopharyngeal swabs rRT-PCR were negative during all the period. Both recipients were discharged for 5 weeks after surgery to prevent out-of-hospital contamination of COVID 19, which would be difficult to differentiate from transmission infection. After 9 months both patients are doing well with no clinical or laboratory signs of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Today we have no evidence of the possibility of transmission of COVID-19 from a SARS-Cov-2 positive donor to a kidney recipient. We also have no reason to suspect kidney damage by COVID-19 in a deceased donor at normal serum creatinine level. Avoiding the use of anti-lymphocyte drugs for induction of immunosuppression may also reduce the risk of developing COVID19 after transplantation. A careful collection and analysis of such dates is necessary to develop modern practical recommendations for transplant centers.","Perlin, D. V.; Alexandrov, I. V.; Shmanev, A. O.; A, T.

314319,Persistent somatic symptoms after a SARS-CoV-2 infection: Long COVID in the Dutch Lifelines Cohort study,2021,"Abstract: The discovery of SARS-CoV-2, the responsible virus for the Covid-19 epidemic, has sparked a global health concern with many countries affected. Developing models that can interpret the epidemic and give common trend parameters are useful for prediction purposes by other countries that are at an earlier phase of the epidemic; it is also useful for future planning against viral respiratory diseases. One model is developed to interpret the fast-growth phase of the epidemic and another model for an interpretation of the entire data set. Both models agree reasonably with the data. It is shown by the first model that during the fast phase, the number of new infected cases depends on the total number of cases by a power-law relation with a scaling exponent equal to 0.82. The second model gives a duplication time in the range 1–3 days early in the start of the epidemic, and another parameter (α = 0.1–0.5) that deviates the progress of the epidemic from an exponential growth. Our models may be used for data interpretation and for guiding predictions regarding this disease, e.g., the onset of the maximum in the number of new cases.

Objective: To assess whether a correlation exists between COVID-19 incidence and chilblains incidence. Design, Setting, and Participants: A retrospective cohort study was conducted within the Kaiser Permanente Northern California system from January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2020; health plan members of all ages were included. Exposure: COVID-19 incidence in 207 location-months, representing 23 geographic locations in northern California across 9 months. Main Outcome and Measures: Chilblains incidence was the main outcome. The association of chilblains incidence with COVID-19 incidence across the 207 location-months was measured using the Spearman rank correlation coefficient. Results: Of 780 patients with chilblains reported during the pandemic, 464 were female (59.5%); mean (SD) age was 36.8 (21.8) years. COVID-19 incidence was correlated with chilblains incidence at 207 location-months (Spearman coefficient 0.18; P = .01). However, only 17 of 456 (3.7%) patients with chilblains tested during the pandemic were positive for SARS-CoV-2, and only 9 of 456 (2.0%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 within 6 weeks of the chilblains diagnosis. Test results of 1 of 97 (1.0%) patients were positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. Latinx patients were disproportionately affected by COVID-19 but not by chilblains. Conclusions and Relevance: This cohort study found that in northern California, the incidence of chilblains increased during the pandemic but was correlated weakly with the incidence of COVID-19 across 207 location-months. These findings may have resulted from a causal role of COVID-19, increased care-seeking by patients with chilblains during the pandemic, or changes in behavior during shelter in place.","McCleskey, Patrick E; Zimmerman, Bree; Lieberman, Amara; Liu, Liyan; Chen, Cynthia; Gorouhi, Farzam; Jacobson, Christine C; Lee, David S; Sriram, Achyuth; Thornton, Amanda; Herz, Arnd M; Mirmirani, Paradi; Herrinton, Lisa J",JAMA Dermatol,,415

METHODS: A social-media survey was carried out, asking 257 optometrists and opticians in Germany, Austria and Switzerland (i) which PPE they intended to use in the future (after lockdown and before herd immunity and / or vaccine availability) and (ii) what they would ask the patient to do in terms of this. RESULTS: 75 % of the ECPs planned on wearing masks during refractions and 69 % when fitting contact lens. 62 % of the ECPs also expected their patients to wear masks in these tasks. This number is higher than for distance tasks such as fitting frames. Around 90 % of the ECPs would, in addition to hand washing, disinfect their hands and around 80 % expected their patients to do so too. Less than one third of ECPs favoured wearing safety spectacles, gloves and / or protective facial shields. 73 % planed on disinfecting frames after they would have been tried on by customers. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, most ECPs planed on continuing to use higher standards of PPE.

METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study performed in an academic setting. A survey was generated and administered to REI fellows and attendings practicing in programs across the United States. Descriptive statistics were used to quantify results regarding clinical volume, academic responsibilities, clinical safety, and fellowship education. RESULTS: The survey response rate was 23%. Eighty-four percent of respondents self-identified as fellows, and 16% identified as program directors or other REI academic instructors. Overall, the survey responses confirmed that the COVID-19 pandemic tremendously affected clinical volume, with 91% of participants reporting their clinical volume decreased by at least half. Although 67% of attendings believed that the changes related to COVID-19 have or will have significantly affected the clinical skills of fellows, 66% of fellows did not believe that their clinical training had been significantly impacted. Sixty-seven percent of fellows and 78% of attendings do not believe that changes related to COVID-19 will affect the ability of fellows to practice independently. CONCLUSION: Even though most attendings surveyed believed that the changes related to COVID-19 would affect the clinical skills of fellows, the cessation of clinical and research activities was short-lived, likely tempering the overall effect on clinical training.

319894,Estrogen and the Disease Severity of SARS-CoV-2 Infection,2020,"Background: The opioid epidemic continues to generate a significant mental and physical health burden on patients, and claims the life of almost 150 Americans daily. Making matters worse, an increase in relapses and/or opioid-related deaths has been reported in more than 40 U.S. states since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Opioid use disorder (OUD) is one of the single most expensive disorders in the United States, generating average medical costs of $60B from just 2 million Americans diagnosed with the disorder. In commercial use since 2019, reSET-O is a non-drug, prescription digital therapeutic (PDT) that delivers evidence-based neurobehavioral treatment for OUD and helps overcome the barriers associated with access to care, stigma, and social distancing. Although shown to be cost effective and efficacious in clinical trials and real-world evidence studies, respectively, information on its value for money from a health utilities and cost per quality-adjusted life-year is needed to inform policy discussions.Objectives: To evaluate the impact of reSET-O on health utilities and assess its overall cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained vs. treatment-as-usual (TAU).Methods: Decision analytic model comparing reSET-O plus TAU to TAU alone (i.e. buprenorphine, face-to-face counseling, and contingency management) over 12 weeks. Clinical effectiveness data (abstinence and health utility) were obtained from a clinical trial, and resource utilization and cost data were adapted from a recent claims data analysis to reflect less frequent face-to-face counseling with the therapeutic.Results: The addition of reSET-O to TAU decreases total health care costs by -$131 and resulted in post-treatment utility values within population norms, with a corresponding gain of 0.003 QALYs. reSET-O when used adjunctively to TAU was economically dominant (less costly, more effective) vs. TAU alone.Conclusion: reSET-O is an economically-dominant adjunctive treatment for OUD and is associated with an overall reduction in total incremental cost vs TAU.","Velez, Fulton F; Luderer, Hilary F; Gerwien, Robert; Parcher, Benjamin; Mezzio, Dylan; Malone, Daniel C",Postgrad Med,,415
320890,Mask-wearing and control of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the USA: a cross-sectional study,2021,"OBJECTIVES: Approximately 8 - 10 % of COVID-19 patients present with a serious clinical course and need for hospitalization, 8% of hospitalized patients need ICU-treatment. Currently, no causal therapy is available and treatment is purely supportive. The main reason for death in critically ill patients is acute respiratory failure. However, in a number of patients a severe hyperinflammatory response with excessively elevated proinflammatory cytokines causes vasoplegic shock resistant to vasopressor therapy. A new polystyrene-based hemoadsorber (CytoSorb®, Cytosorbents Inc., New Jersey, USA) has been shown to adsorb effectively cytokines and other middle molecular weight toxins this way reducing their blood concentrations. This has been routinely used in clinical practice in the EU for other conditions where a cytokine storm occurs and an observational study has just been completed on COVID-19 patients. We hypothesized that the extracorporeal elimination of cytokines in critically ill COVID-19 patients with suspected hyperinflammation and shock may stabilize hemodynamics and improve outcome. The primary endpoint is time until resolution of vasoplegic shock, which is a well implemented, clinically relevant endpoint in critical care studies. TRIAL DESIGN: Phase IIb, multicenter, prospective, open-label, randomized, 1:1 parallel group pilot study comparing the additional use of ""CytoSorb"" to standard of care without ""CytoSorb"". PARTICIPANTS: Patients are recruited from the Intensive Care Units (ICUs) of 7 participating centers in Germany (approximately 10 ICUs). All patients aged 18- 80 with positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for SARS-CoV-2, a C-reactive protein (CRP) &#8805; 100 mg/l, a Procalcitonin (PCT) < 2 ng/l, and suspected cytokine storm defined via a vasoplegic shock (Norepinephrine > 0.2 µg/min/kg to achieve a Mean Arterial Pressure &#8805; 65mmHg). Patients are included irrespective of indication for renal replacement therapy. Suspected or proven bacterial cause for vasoplegic shock is a contraindication. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Within 24 hours after meeting the inclusion criteria patients will be randomized to receive either standard of care or standard of care and additional ""CytoSorb"" therapy via a shaldon catheter for 3-7 days. Filter exchange is done every 24 hours. If patients receive antibiotics, an additional dose of antibiotics is administered after each change of ""CytoSorb"" filter in order to prevent underdosing due to ""CytoSorb"" treatment. MAIN OUTCOMES: Primary outcome is time to resolution of vasoplegic shock (defined as no need for vasopressors for at least 8 hours in order to sustain a MAP &#8805; 65mmHg) in days. Secondary outcomes are 7 day mortality after fulfilling the inclusion criteria, mortality until hospital discharge, Interleukin-6 (IL-6) measurement on day 1 and 3, need for mechanical ventilation, duration of mechanical ventilation, duration of ICU-stay, catecholamine dose on day 1/2/3 after start of ""CytoSorb"" and acute kidney injury. RANDOMIZATION: An electronic randomization will be performed using the study software secuTrial® administered by the Clinical Study Center (CSC) of the Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Germany. Randomization is done in blocks by 4 stratified by including center. BLINDING (MASKING): The trial will be non-blinded for the clinicians and patients. The statistician will receive a blinded data set, so that all analyses will be conducted blinded. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMIZED (SAMPLE SIZE): As this is a pilot study with the goal to examine the feasibility of the study design as well as the intervention effect, no formal sample size calculation was conducted. A total number of approximately 80-100 patients is planned (40-50 patients per group). Safety assessment is done after the inclusion of each 10 patients per randomization group.

Pregnant women are susceptible to respiratory pathogens and the development of severe pneumonia, suggesting the urgent need to assess the potential maternal and infant outcome of pregnancy with COVID-19. The intrauterine vertical transmission potential of SARS-CoV-2 also remains controversial. Herein, we discuss the potential effect of COVID-19 on maternal and infant outcomes based on current studies, including those published in Chinese, in a total of 80 mothers with COVID-19 and 80 infants. We also comprehensively explored the mother-to-child transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2, in particular the route of intrauterine vertical transmission. Given SARS-CoV-2 is a sister to SARS-CoV, of the SARS-related coronavirus species, we made a comprehensive comparison between them to learn from experiences with SARS. Although there is no evidence supporting the intrauterine vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2, our comprehensive analysis suggests that the adverse maternal and infant outcomes caused by COVID-19 cannot be underestimated.

326396,Mechanisms of Bioactivities of Fucoidan from the Brown Seaweed Fucus vesiculosus L. of the Barents Sea,2020,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has been regarded as one of the leading cause of injury-related death and disability. White matter injury after TBI is characterized by axon damage and demyelination, resulting in neural network impairment and neurological deficit. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) can promote white matter repair. The activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARÎ³) has been reported to promote microglia/macrophages towards anti-inflammatory state and therefore to promote axon regeneration. Bexarotene, an agonist of retinoid X receptor (RXR), can activate RXR/PPARÎ³ heterodimers. The aim of the present study was to identify the effect of bexarotene on BDNF in microglia/macrophages and axon sprouting after TBI in mice. Bexarotene was administered intraperitoneally in C57BL/6 mice undergoing controlled cortical impact (CCI). PPARÎ³ dependency was determined by intraperitoneal administration of a PPARÎ³ antagonist T0070907. We found that bexarotene promoted axon regeneration indicated by increased growth associated protein 43 (GAP43) expression, myelin basic protein (MBP) expression, and biotinylated dextran amine (BDA)+ axon sprouting. Bexarotene also increased microglia/macrophages-specific brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression after TBI. In addition, bexarotene reduced the number of pro-inflammatory microglia/macrophages while increased the number of anti-inflammatory microglia/macrophages after TBI. Moreover, bexaortene inhibited pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion. In addition, bexarotene treatment improved neurological scores and cognitive function of CCI-injured mice. These effects of bexarotene were partially abolished by T0070907. In conclusion, bexarotene promotes axon sprouting, increases microglia/macrophages-specific BDNF expression, and induces microglia/macrophages from a pro-inflammatory state towards an anti-inflammatory one after TBI at least partially in a PPARÎ³-dependent manner.","He, Junchi; Huang, Yike; Liu, Han; Sun, Xiaochuan; Wu, Jingchuan; Zhang, Zhaosi; Liu, Liu; Zhou, Chao; Jiang, Shaoqiu; Huang, Zhijian; Zhong, Jianjun; Guo, Zongduo; Jiang, Li; Cheng, Chongjie",Exp Neurol,,415

As treatments are of the utmost importance, drug repurposing embodies a rich and rapid drug discovery landscape, where candidate drug compounds could be identified and optimized. To this end, we tested seven compounds for their ability to reduce replication of human coronavirus (HCoV)-229E, another member of the coronavirus family. Among these seven drugs tested, four of them, namely rapamycin, disulfiram, loperamide and valproic acid, were highly cytotoxic and did not warrant further testing. In contrast, we observed a reduction of the viral titer by 80% with resveratrol (50% effective concentration (EC50) = 4.6 µM) and lopinavir/ritonavir (EC50 = 8.8 µM) and by 60% with chloroquine (EC50 = 5 µM) with very limited cytotoxicity. Among these three drugs, resveratrol was less cytotoxic (cytotoxic concentration 50 (CC50) = 210 µM) than lopinavir/ritonavir (CC50 = 102 µM) and chloroquine (CC50 = 67 µM). Thus, among the seven drugs tested against HCoV-229E, resveratrol demonstrated the optimal antiviral response with low cytotoxicity with a selectivity index (SI) of 45.65. Similarly, among the three drugs with an anti-HCoV-229E activity, namely lopinavir/ritonavir, chloroquine and resveratrol, only the latter showed a reduction of the viral titer on SARS-CoV-2 with reduced cytotoxicity. This opens the door to further evaluation to fight Covid-19.","Pasquereau, Sébastien; Nehme, Zeina; Haidar Ahmad, Sandy; Daouad, Fadoua; Van Assche, Jeanne; Wallet, Clémentine; Schwartz, Christian; Rohr, Olivier; Morot-Bizot, Stéphanie; Herbein, Georges",Viruses,,415

METHOD: Data from 564 young adults (ages 22-29, 60.7% women) were collected in January 2020 (pre-pandemic) and April/May 2020 (during pandemic). RESULTS: Loneliness increased from January to April/May and changes in loneliness were greater for females, those with higher perceived social support in January, and those with greater concerns about the pandemic's social impacts. Depression (but not anxiety) increased during this time with changes in loneliness accounting for much of the increase in depression.

332558,SARS-COV-2 Infection in a Term Neonate Presenting with Respiratory Failure on Day 3 of Life,2020,"BACKGROUND: Adult, benign, non-iatrogenic bronchoesophageal fistula (BEF) is a rare condition, which is occasionally described in single case reports. Therefore, little is known about its possible causes, presentation and management. METHODS: A systematic search of the literature in MEDLINE, PubMed Central and EMBASE databases between 1990 and 2020 was carried out to identify all cases of BEF. The initial database search identified 19,452 articles, of which 183 (251 individual patient cases) were included in the final analysis. RESULTS: Main causes of BEF were congenital malformations (97/251, 38.7%) and infections (82/251, 32.7%), while 33/251 (13.1%) fistulae were regarded as idiopathic and 39/251 (15.5%) attributed to other causes. Esophagograpy was the most sensitive method of diagnosis (97.4%) compared with esophagoscopy (78.9%), computed tomography (49.6%) and bronchoscopy (46.0%). Definitive treatment was surgical for 176 patients (70%), endoscopic for 25 (10%) and medical for 37 (14.7%). Compared with congenital BEFs, infective BEFs had shorter median symptom duration and were distributed more proximally over the bronchial tree. Definitive treatment was almost only surgical for congenital BEFs, while infective BEFs were treated also endoscopically (12%) and by medical therapy (38%). Morbidity, treatment failure and recurrence rates were higher for infective BEFs. CONCLUSIONS: BEFs are rare. Symptoms are non-specific and a high index of suspicion is necessary for diagnosis. Patients with infective BEF tend to have a more severe clinical picture than those with congenital BEF. Surgery is the main treatment for patients affected by congenital BEF, while infective BEFs may heal conservatively.","Mammana, Marco; Pangoni, Alessandro; Lorenzoni, Giulia; Catelli, Chiara; Natale, Giuseppe; Gregori, Dario; Dell039,; Amore, Andrea; Rea, Federico",World j. sur,,415

333684,Could anticoagulation therapy prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection prevent complications and the need for mechanical ventilation?,2020,"Whenever the retinal image changes some neurons in visual cortex increase their rate of firing, while others decrease their rate of firing. Linking specific sets of neuronal responses with perception and behavior is essential for understanding mechanisms of neural circuit computation. We trained mice of both sexes to perform visual detection tasks and used optogenetic perturbations to increase or decrease neuronal spiking primary visual cortex (V1). Perceptual reports were always enhanced by increments in V1 spike counts and impaired by decrements, even when increments and decrements in spiking were generated in the same neuronal populations. Moreover, detecting changes in cortical activity depended on spike count integration rather than instantaneous changes in spiking. Recurrent neural networks trained in the task similarly relied on increments in neuronal activity when activity has costs. This work clarifies neuronal decoding strategies employed by cerebral cortex to translate cortical spiking into percepts that can be used to guide behavior.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTVisual responses in the primary visual cortex (V1) are diverse, in that neurons can be either excited or inhibited by the onset of a visual stimulus. We selectively potentiated or suppressed V1 spiking in mice while they performed contrast change detection tasks. In other experiments, excitation or inhibition was delivered to V1 independent of visual stimuli. Mice readily detected increases in V1 spiking while equivalent reductions in V1 spiking suppress the probability of detection, even when increases and decreases in V1 spiking are generated in the same neuronal populations. Our data raise the striking possibility that only increments in spiking are used to render information to structures downstream of V1.","Cone, Jackson J; Bade, Morgan L; Masse, Nicolas Y; Page, Elizabeth A; Freedman, David J; Maunsell, John H R",J. neurosci,,415

However, in the 10 months after its first case, Rwanda recorded 10316 cases and 133 COVID-19-related deaths translating to a case fatality rate (CFR) of 1.3%, which raised the question: why does Rwanda have a low COVID-19 CFR? Here we analysed COVID-19 data and explored possible explanations to better understand the disease burden in the context of Rwanda's infection control strategies.We investigated whether the age distribution plays a role in the observed low CFR in Rwanda by comparing the expected number of deaths for 10-year age bands based on the CFR reported in other countries with the observed number of deaths for each age group. We found that the age-specific CFRs in Rwanda are similar to or, in some older age groups, slightly higher than those in other countries, suggesting that the lower population level CFR reflects the younger age structure in Rwanda, rather than a lower risk of death conditional on age. We also accounted for Rwanda's comprehensive SARS-CoV-2 testing strategies and reliable documentation of COVID-19-related deaths and deduced that these measures may have allowed them to likely identify more asymptomatic or mild cases than other countries and reduced their reported CFR.Overall, the observed low COVID-19 deaths in Rwanda is likely influenced by the combination of effective infection control strategies, reliable identification of cases and reporting of deaths, and the population's young age structure.","Musanabaganwa, Clarisse; Cubaka, Vincent; Mpabuka, Etienne; Semakula, Muhammed; Nahayo, Ernest; Hedt-Gauthier, Bethany L; Ng, Kamela C S; Murray, Megan B; Kateera, Fredrick; Mutesa, Leon; Nsanzimana, Sabin",,,415

Methods: Fifty-two handball coaches participated in this study (Mage=37.4 years; SDage=8.4), who coach U-8 to adult teams, and answered an online survey divided into two main sections: a) coaches' actions with athletes and/or teams throughout social isolation; b) professional learning during social isolation. Descriptive statistics were used for quantitative data analysis and Thematic Analysis for qualitative data analysis. Results: The coaches mentioned that the contact with the teams has been made mostly with WhatsApp (94.2%) and Google Meet or Zoom (75.0%), in which coaches mainly emphasize physical fitness (69.2%) and tactical knowledge (67.3%). For professional learning, coaches are participating in online lectures (96.2%), and virtual meetings (92.3%). Coaches also seek content mainly related to teaching approaches (82.7%), and specific handball exercises (75.0%). Regarding expectations after the social isolation, coaches reported concern about uncertainties for sports practice (restriction of physical contact, decreased incentives for teams, and competitions) and possible psychological benefits (motivation to practice, overcoming difficulties, and learning new resources). Conclusion: The coaches revealed the concern about maintaining the athletes' performance during the social isolation, the uncertainties for the future of the teams, and the difficulties to use different resources for training. We suggested that the courses for coaches emphasize aspects that enable the learning of new technologies (e.g. social networks, video edition, and research platforms).","Musa, Vinicius da Silva; Santos, Walmir Romário dos; Menezes, Rodolfo Pombo; Costa, Valter; Aquino, Rodrigo; Menezes, Rafael Pombo",Motriz (Online),,415

METHODS: Using de-identified claims data for children <18 years old from OptumLabs® Data Warehouse, a large commercial claims database, we compared monthly primary care visit and vaccination rates from January-October 2020 to January-October 2018 and 2019. Visit rates were analyzed by visit reason and by the month after (eg, month +1) the COVID-19 public health emergency declaration using a series of child-level Poisson regression models. RESULTS: There were 3.4, 3.4, and 3.1 million children in 2018, 2019, and 2020 cohorts, respectively. Compared to the same months in prior years, primary care visits in 2020 were 60% lower in month +1 (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 0.40, 99% confidence interval [CI] 0.40-0.40) and 17% lower in month +7 (IRR 0.83, 99% CI 0.83-0.83). Preventive visit rates were 53% lower in month +1 (IRR 0.47, 99% CI 0.47-0.47), but 8% higher than prior years in month +7 (IRR 1.08, 99% CI 1.08-1.08). Monthly rates of vaccine administration followed a similar pattern. Problem-focused visits remained 31% lower in month +7 (IRR 0.69, 99% CI 0.68-0.69), with notably fewer infection-related visits (acute respiratory tract infections IRR 0.37, 99% CI 0.36-0.37; gastroenteritis IRR 0.20, 99% CI 0.20-0.20). CONCLUSION: Seven months after the COVID-19 emergency declaration, receipt of pediatric care remained suppressed due to fewer problem-focused visits, with notably fewer infection-related visits.

Additionally, we explain our strategic plan aimed at minimizing the impact on clinical trial research activities, which included SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and IgG serological tests to all participants and personnel. The outcomes of the plan are described in terms of observed safety events and drop-outs during the study period. RESULTS: A total of 130 patients were participating in 16 active clinical trials in Fundació ACE when the lockdown was established. During the confinement, we performed 1018 calls to the participants, which led to identify adverse events in 26 and COVID-19 symptoms in 6. A total of 83 patients (64%) could restart on-site visits as early as May 11, 2020. All SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR diagnostic tests performed before on-site visits were negative and only three IgG serological tests were positive. Throughout the study period, we only observed one drop-out, due to an adverse event unrelated to COVID-19.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the heart of patients who survived COVID-19 and to compare the cardiac outcome between patients who recovered from mild-to-moderate or severe illness. METHODS: With use of ECG and echocardiography, we examined the heart of 105 patients who had been hospitalized with COVID-19 and were consecutively recruited after hospital discharge while attending follow-up visits. Survivors of COVID-19 were compared with 105 matched controls. We also compared the cardiac outcome and lung ultrasound scan between COVID-19 patients who had mild-to-moderate or severe illness. RESULTS: Cardiac data were collected a median of 41 days from the first detection of COVID-19. Symptoms were present in a low percentage of patients. In comparison with matched controls, no considerable structural or functional differences were observed in the heart of survivors of COVID-19. Lung ultrasound scan detected significantly greater residual pulmonary involvement in COVID-19 patients who had recovered from severe than mild-to-moderate illness. No significant differences were detected in ECG tracings nor were found in the left and right ventricular function of patients who had recovered from mild-to-moderate or severe illness. CONCLUSIONS: In a short-term follow-up, no abnormalities were identified in the heart of survivors of COVID-19, nor cardiac differences were detected between patients who had different severity of illness.

We identified 92 relevant studies out of 612 that were initially found on the sentiment analysis of students’ feedback in learning platform environments. The mapping results showed that, despite the identified challenges, the field is rapidly growing, especially regarding the application of DL, which is the most recent trend. We identified various aspects that need to be considered in order to contribute to the maturity of research and development in the field. Among these aspects, we highlighted the need of having structured datasets, standardized solutions and increased focus on emotional expression and detection.","Kastrati, Zenun Dalipi Fisnik Ali Shariq Imran Nuci Krenare Pireva Mudasir Ahmad Wani",Applied Sciences,,415

335589,A PATIENT WITH NEUROLOGICAL MANIFESTATIONS AS UNIQUE PRESENTATION OF SARS-CoV-2 INFECTION,2020,"BACKGROUND: The impact of corticosteroid therapy on outcomes of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is highly controversial. We aimed to compare the risk of death between COVID-19-related ARDS patients with corticosteroid treatment and those without. METHODS: In this single-center retrospective observational study, patients with ARDS caused by COVID-19 between January 20, 2020, and February 24, 2020, were enrolled. The primary outcome was 60-day in-hospital death. The exposure was prescribed systemic corticosteroids or not. Time-dependent Cox regression models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for 60-day in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: A total of 382 patients [60.7 ± 14.1 years old (mean ± SD), 61.3% males] were analyzed. The median of sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score was 2.0 (IQR 2.0-3.0). Of these cases, 94 (24.6%) patients had invasive mechanical ventilation. The number of patients received systemic corticosteroids was 226 (59.2%), and 156 (40.8%) received standard treatment. The maximum dose of corticosteroids was 80.0 (IQR 40.0-80.0) mg equivalent methylprednisolone per day, and duration of corticosteroid treatment was 7.0 (4.0-12.0) days in total. In Cox regression analysis using corticosteroid treatment as a time-varying variable, corticosteroid treatment was associated with a significant reduction in risk of in-hospital death within 60 days after adjusting for age, sex, SOFA score at hospital admission, propensity score of corticosteroid treatment, comorbidities, antiviral treatment, and respiratory supports (HR 0.42; 95% CI 0.21, 0.85; p = 0.0160). Corticosteroids were not associated with delayed viral RNA clearance in our cohort. CONCLUSION: In this clinical practice setting, low-dose corticosteroid treatment was associated with reduced risk of in-hospital death within 60 days in COVID-19 patients who developed ARDS.","Wu, Chaomin; Hou, Dongni; Du, Chunling; Cai, Yanping; Zheng, Junhua; Xu, Jie; Chen, Xiaoyan; Chen, Cuicui; Hu, Xianglin; Zhang, Yuye; Song, Juan; Wang, Lu; Chao, Yen-Cheng; Feng, Yun; Xiong, Weining; Chen, Dechang; Zhong, Ming; Hu, Jie; Jiang, Jinjun; Bai, Chunxue; Zhou, Xin; Xu, Jinfu; Song, Yuanlin; Gong, Fengyun",Crit Care,,415

337120,"SARS-CoV-2 infection in children requiring hospitalization: the experience of Navarra, Spain",2020,"Background: Understanding carriage and transmission potential of SARS-CoV-2 in children is of paramount importance to understand the spread of virus in school and community settings. Methods: We performed an updated rapid review to investigate the role of children in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. We synthesized evidence for five categories and results are reported narratively. Results: A total of 33 new studies were included for this review. We did not identify additional studies that reported documented cases of SARS-CoV-2 transmission by children. We identified 15 new studies that demonstrate children's susceptibility and transmission risk of SARS-CoV-2 with evidence provided on the chance of being index or secondary cases, the potential of faecal-oral transmission, and the possibility of asymptomatic transmission. There is little data on the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in schools. There were three studies reporting COVID-19 school outbreaks in France (Oise), Australia (New South Wales) and Israel. The remaining four studies found that all reported cases did not infect any other pupils or staff. With data from seven studies and governmental websites, the proportion of children among all confirmed COVID-19 patients was estimated for 29 countries, varying from 0.3% (lowest in Spain) up to 13.8% (highest in Argentina). Lastly, we identified seven studies reporting on PIMS-TS linked to COVID-19 among paediatric patients. Conclusions: There is somewhat limited evidence available for quantifying the extent to which children may contribute to overall transmission, but the balance of evidence so far suggests that children and schools play only a limited role in overall transmission.","Li, Xue; Xu, Wei; Dozier, Marshall; He, Yazhou; Kirolos, Amir; Lang, Zhongyu; Song, Peige; Theodoratou, Evropi",J Glob Health,,415
337169,Systematic screening for SARS-CoV-2 in pregnant women admitted for delivery: not as easy as it sounds,2020,"The new coronavirus infection, which was identified in Wuhan (Hubei province, China) in late 2019, caused an outbreak of severe pneumonia. The disease quickly spread throughout China and was followed by a dramatic increase in number of new cases in other countries of the world. Certain population groups that require particular attention include pregnant women due to the fact that pneumonia is the third-leading indirect cause of maternal mortality. Among the controversial issues in the management of pregnant women with COVID-19, special attention should be paid to the tactics of prolonging pregnancy and approaches to childbirth. The available scientific and clinical data are currently insufficient to perform a complete assessment of perinatal outcomes in pregnant women with COVID-19. Researchers and practical healthcare specialists have more questions than answers due to the limited time and number of studies, lack of evidence of vertically transmitted infection from mother to fetus, absence of clear understanding of viral pathogenesis during pregnancy, as well as the level and degree of initiation of SARS-CoV-2 pathological processes in the mother and fetus that can have a negative influence on the perinatal This review is devoted to the analysis of pregnancy and childbirth outcomes, presentation of current approaches to the management of women with novel coronavirus infection COVID-19 during pregnancy and childbirth on the basis of the available literature data in the domestic and foreign clinical guidelines.","Bezhenar, Vitaliy F.; Zazerskaya, Irina E.; Bettikher, Ofelia A.; Nesterov, Igor M.; Bautin, Andrey E.",Akush.

This is the first observational study to evaluate its impact on the orthopedic workload in a London level 1 trauma center (i.e., a major trauma center [MTC]) before (2019) and during (2020) the ""golden month"" post-COVID-19 lockdown.Patients and methods - We performed a longitudinal observational prevalence study of both acute orthopedic trauma referrals, operative and anesthetic casemix for the first ""golden"" month from March 17, 2020. We compared the data with the same period in 2019. Statistical analyses included median (median absolute deviation), risk and odds ratios, as well as Fisher's exact test to calculate the statistical significance, set at p &#8804; 0.05.Results - Acute trauma referrals in the post-COVID period were almost halved compared with 2019, with similar distribution between pediatric and adult patients, requiring a significant 19% more admissions (RR 1.3, OR 2.6, p = 0.003). Hip fractures and polytrauma cases accounted for an additional 11% of the modal number of injuries in 2020, but with 19% reduction in isolated limb injuries that were modal in 2019. Total operative cases fell by a third during the COVID-19 outbreak. There was a decrease of 14% (RR 0.85, OR 0.20, p = 0.006) in aerosol-generating anesthetic techniques used.Interpretation - The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a decline in the number of acute trauma referrals, admissions (but increased risk and odds ratio), operations, and aerosolizing anesthetic procedures since implementing social distancing and lockdown measures during the ""golden month.""","Park, Chang; Sugand, Kapil; Nathwani, Dinesh; Bhattacharya, Rajarshi; Sarraf, Khaled M",Acta Orthop,,415

OBJECTIVE: To describe the full adaptation of the discipline of geriatrics to a web-based learning tool, of two activities that were developed including the current COVID-19 to illustrate some of the main concepts of geriatric medicine. METHODS: The course was fully adapted to the open-source course management system called MOODLE. The first activity was a COVID-19 clinical case discussion, whose main objective was to include COVID-19 in the content of our course, illustrating some of the main concepts of geriatrics. The second activity was a Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) experience, done via videoconference, which also assessed the impact of social distancing measures on the health of older adults. RESULTS: A total of 43 medical students performed both activities, and 95% of the students considered the inclusion of the COVID-19 into the discipline of geriatrics useful, 88% approved the practical experience of CGA, and 84% felt that they contributed to the health of the interviewees after contact. CONCLUSION: Adapting our discipline to a web-based learning tool, while including the current COVID-19 in our course content and a practical experience of CGA via videoconference was possible and approved by students. The adoption of this initiative may not only be an academic strategy, but also a possible way to improve the quality of life of older people during the COVID-19 pandemic","Saraiva, Marcos Daniel; Gorzoni, Milton Luiz","Geriatr., Gerontol.

However, there is limited evidence available to inform alcohol policies during such events. In this commentary, we present the range of government actions to control public access to alcohol during the novel coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic in provinces and territories across Canada. Liquor retailers, including both private and government-run retailers, have been designated as essential services in all jurisdictions, operating under an evolving set of rules. From a public health perspective, keeping liquor retailers open during pandemic-related lockdown restrictions is a delicate decision which poses new risks and considerations about the best strategy for minimizing alcohol-related harms. We discuss the need to strike a balance between supplying public access to alcohol, particularly to those living with dependence, and unintentionally sending the message that alcohol is essential in our lives and encouraging consumption. Given the far-reaching effects of alcohol on health, social, psychological, economic, and work safety outcomes, we describe international guidance for minimizing alcohol-related harms and suggest that a nuanced and evidence-informed discussion about the considerations and impacts of alcohol control measures during a public health emergency should be undertaken.","Hobin, Erin; Smith, Brendan",Can J Public Health,,415

On March 14, 2020, at the beginning of the first epidemic wave of COVID-19 in France, a cluster was reported in a nursing home in the Nouvelle-Aquitaine region. We monitored the outbreak as well as the infection prevention and control (IPC) measures implemented. METHODS: A confirmed case was defined as laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in a resident or staff member present in the nursing home between March 7 and May 1, 2020; and a probable case as a person presenting an acute respiratory illness after contact with a confirmed case. Symptomatic inpatient residents and symptomatic staff members were systematically tested for SARS-CoV-2. In addition, two screening sessions were held on site. RESULTS: We identified 109 cases (98 confirmed, 11 probable). The attack rate was 66% among residents and 45% among staff. Half of all cases were identified during the screening sessions. One-quarter of cases had minor symptoms or were asymptomatic. The case fatality rate among residents was 29%. IPC measures were rapidly implemented such as the quarantine of residents, the reinforcement of staff personal protective equipment, and home quarantine of staff testing positive, which were supplemented in April by systematic controls at the entrance of the nursing home and the creation of additional staff break rooms. CONCLUSIONS: This outbreak confirmed the considerable health impact of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a nursing home. In addition to the implementation of IPC measures, the early detection of cases through the screening of residents and staff is essential to identify asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic cases and limit the spread of the virus.","Bernadou, A; Bouges, S; Catroux, M; Rigaux, J C; Laland, C; Levêque, N; Noury, U; Larrieu, S; Acef, S; Habold, D; Cazenave-Roblot, F; Filleul, L",BMC Infect Dis,,415
342994,Late rhabdomyolysis secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection,2021,"BACKGROUND: Error communication includes both reporting errors to superiors and disclosing their consequences to patients and their families. It significantly contributes to error prevention and safety improvement. Yet, some errors in intensive care units are not communicated. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to explore factors affecting error communication in intensive care units. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: This qualitative study was conducted in 2019. Participants were 17 critical care nurses purposively recruited from the intensive care units of 2 public hospitals affiliated to Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. Data were collected through in-depth semi-structured interviews and were analyzed through the conventional content analysis method proposed by Graneheim and Lundman. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS: The Ethics Committee of Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran approved the study (code: IR.IUMS. REC.1397.792). Participants were informed about the study aim and methods and were ensured of data confidentiality. They were free to withdraw from the study at will. Written informed consent was obtained from all of them. FINDINGS: Factors affecting error communication in intensive care units fell into four main categories, namely the culture of error communication (subcategories were error communication organizational atmosphere, clarity of processes and guidelines, managerial support for nurses, and learning organization), the consequences of errors for nurses and nursing (subcategories were fear over being stigmatized as incompetent, fear over punishment, and fear over negative judgments about nursing), the consequences of errors for patients (subcategories were monitoring the effects of errors on patients and predicting the effects of errors on patients), and ethical and professional characteristics (subcategories were ethical characteristics and inter-professional relationships). DISCUSSION: The results of this study show many factors affect error communication, some facilitate and some prohibit it. Organizational factors such as the culture of error communication and the consequences of error communication for the nurse and the patient, as well as individual and professional characteristics, including ethical characteristics and interprofessional relationship, influence this process. CONCLUSION: Errors confront nurses with ethical challenges and make them assess error consequences and then, communicate or hide them based on the results of their assessments. Health authorities can promote nurses' error communication through creating a supportive environment for them, developing clear error communication processes and guidelines, and providing them with education about the principles of ethical practice.","Ghezeljeh, Tahereh Najafi; Farahani, Mansoureh Ashghali; Ladani, Fatemeh Kafami",Nurs Ethics,,415

Many Polish outpatient clinics have been implementing telemedical consultations as a tool to ensure the continuity of care for patients with chronic diseases. The aim of the study was to evaluate patients' satisfaction with telemedical appointments, as well as availability of the various medical services and patients' well-being during the pandemic. Material and methods: An online-based questionnaire on the experience with telemedical consultations, availability of medical services and current state of health was conducted among Polish rheumatology patients approximately 6 months after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: The survey was completed by 107 respondents with a mean age of 41.52 +/-14.33 years. The overall level of satisfaction from telemedical consultations, evaluated with a VAS 1-10 scale, was assessed as 6.23 +/-3.04 for teleconsultations in primary healthcare units and 6.00 +/-2.80 for rheumatology outpatient units. 42.99% of the respondents were in favour of maintaining telemedical appointments even after the pandemic. Incidences of reduced access to medical services during the COVID-19 pandemic were reported by 77.57% of the patients. Almost half of the respondents reported reduced accessibility to rheumatological care. An alarming decline in health self-esteem, evaluated with a VAS 1-10 scale, was noted from the average 6.37 +/-1.92 before COVID-19 to the current rating of 5.78 +/-1.91 (p = 0.0087).

346696,Differential occupational risks to healthcare workers from SARS-CoV-2 observed during a prospective observational study,2020,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 is the pathogenetic agent of Corona Virus Induced Disease (COVID)19. The virus enters the human cells after binding to the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)2 receptor in target tissues. ACE2 expression is induced in response to inflammation. The colon expression of ACE2 is upregulated in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), highlighting a potential risk of intestinal inflammation in promoting viral entry in the human body. Because mechanisms that regulate ACE2 expression in the intestine are poorly understood and there is a need of anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapies, we have settled to investigate whether natural flavonoids might regulate the expression of Ace2 in intestinal models of inflammation. The results of these studies demonstrated that pelargonidin activates the Aryl hydrocarbon Receptor (AHR) in vitro and reverses intestinal inflammation caused by chronic exposure to high fat diet or to the intestinal braking-barrier agent TNBS in a AhR-dependent manner. In these two models, development of colon inflammation associated with upregulation of Ace2 mRNA expression. Colon levels of Ace2 mRNA were directly correlated with Tnf-&#945; mRNA levels. Molecular docking studies suggested that pelargonidin binds a fatty acid binding pocket on the receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. In vitro studies demonstrated that pelargonidin significantly reduces the binding of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein to ACE2 and reduces the SARS-CoV-2 replication in a concentration-dependent manner. In summary, we have provided evidence that a natural flavonoid might hold potential in reducing intestinal inflammation and ACE2 induction in the inflamed colon in a AhR-dependent manner.","Biagioli, Michele; Marchianò, Silvia; Roselli, Rosalinda; Di Giorgio, Cristina; Bellini, Rachele; Bordoni, Martina; Gidari, Anna; Sabbatini, Samuele; Francisci, Daniela; Fiorillo, Bianca; Catalanotti, Bruno; Distrutti, Eleonora; Carino, Adriana; Zampella, Angela; Costantino, Gabriele; Fiorucci, Stefano",Biochem Pharmacol,,415

METHODS: An online survey was performed of orthopaedic surgeons in the German-speaking Arthroscopy Society (Gesellschaft für Arthroskopie und Gelenkchirurgie, AGA). The survey consisted of 20 questions concerning four topics: four questions addressed the origin and surgical experience of the participant, 12 questions dealt with potential cutbacks in orthopaedic healthcare and 4 questions addressed the influence of the pandemic on the particular surgeon. RESULTS: Of 4234 contacted orthopaedic surgeons, 1399 responded. Regarding arthroscopic procedures between 10 and 30% of the participants stated that these were still being performed-with actual percentages depending on the specific joint and procedure. Only 6.2% of the participants stated that elective total joint arthroplasty was still being performed at their centre. In addition, physical rehabilitation and surgeons' postoperative follow-ups were severely affected. CONCLUSION: Orthopaedic healthcare services in Austria, Germany, and Switzerland are suffering a drastic cutback due to COVID-19. A drastic reduction in arthroscopic procedures like rotator cuff repair and cruciate ligament reconstruction and an almost total shutdown of elective total joint arthroplasty were reported. Long-term consequences cannot be predicted yet. The described disruption in orthopaedic healthcare services has to be viewed as historic.

Measures have been taken to reduce the spread of the virus, including school closures and widespread lockdowns. Physical isolation combined with economic instability, fear of infection, and uncertainty for the future has had a profound impact on global mental health. For adolescents, the effects of this stress may be heightened due to important developmental characteristics. Canadian adolescents (n = 1,054; M age= 16.68, SD = 0.78) completed online surveys and responded to questions on stress surrounding the COVID-19 crisis, feelings of loneliness and depression, as well as time spent with family, virtually with friends, doing schoolwork, using social media, and engaging in physical activity. Results showed that adolescents are very concerned about the COVID-19 crisis and are particularly worried about schooling and peer relationships. COVID-19 stress was related to more loneliness and more depression, especially for adolescents who spend more time on social media. Beyond COVID-19 stress, more time connecting to friends virtually during the pandemic was related to greater depression, but family time and schoolwork was related to less depression. For adolescents with depressive symptoms, it may be important to monitor the supportiveness of online relationships. Results show promising avenues to stave off loneliness, as time with family, time connecting to friends, as well as physical activity were related to lower loneliness, beyond COVID-19 stress. These results shed light on the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic for adolescents and document possible pathways to ameliorate negative effects.","Ellis, Wendy E.; Dumas, Tara M.; Forbes, Lindsey M.",Can.

Especially in the context of hospitalization, it can be expected to have a strong influence on affective reactions and preventive behavior. Research is needed to develop evidence-driven strategies to cope with this challenging situation. To this end, the present survey investigates the effect of personality traits, risk taking behavior, and anxiety on affective reactions and anticipated behavior in the medical context during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify key factors associated with individuals concerns regarding hygiene in hospitals and the decision to postpone surgeries. METHODS: Cross-sectional online survey of N = 929 residents of Germany (n = 792 women; 85.3%) with a mean age of 35.2 years (SD = 12.9). Hypotheses were tested with a saturated path analysis. RESULTS: A direct effect of anxiety on concerns about safety (ß = -.12, CI [ -.20; -.05]) and hygiene in hospitals (ß = .16, CI [.08; .23]) was found. Risk taking and the personality traits were related neither with concerns about safety and hygiene in hospitals nor with anticipated behavior. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that no distinct interventions or information campaigns is are necessary for individuals with different personality traits, or different levels of risk taking behavior. However, we recommend that health care workers when interacting with patients should carefully address anxiety.","Ostermann, Thomas; Gampe, Julia; Röer, Jan Philipp; Radtke, Theda",J. med. internet res,,415

These methods visualize airflow by visualizing density gradients in transparent media. The playing of professional woodwind and brass instrument players, as well as professional classical trained singers were investigated to estimate the spread distances of the breathing air. For a better comparison and consistent measurement series, a single high note, a single low note, and an extract of a musical piece were investigated. Additionally, anemometry was used to determine the velocity of the spreading breathing air and the extent to which it was quantifiable. The results showed that the ejected airflow from the examined instruments and singers did not exceed a spreading range of 1.2 m into the room. However, differences in the various instruments have to be considered to assess properly the spread of the breathing air. The findings discussed below help to estimate the risk of cross-infection for wind instrument players and singers and to develop efficacious safety precautions, which is essential during critical health periods such as the current COVID-19 pandemic.","Becher, Lia; Gena, Amayu W; Alsaad, Hayder; Richter, Bernhard; Spahn, Claudia; Voelker, Conrad",Indoor air,,415

While it is essential to quantify risk and characterize transmission dynamics in closed populations using Susceptible-Infection-Recovered modeling, the investigation of the effect from worldwide pandemic cannot be neglected. This study proposes a network analysis to assess global pandemic risk by linking 164 countries in pandemic networks, where links between countries were specified by the level of 'co-movement' of newly confirmed COVID-19 cases. More countries showing increase in the COVID-19 cases simultaneously will signal the pandemic prevalent over the world. The network density, clustering coefficients, and assortativity in the pandemic networks provide early warning signals of the pandemic in late February 2020. We propose a preparedness pandemic risk score for prediction and a severity risk score for pandemic control. The preparedness risk score contributed by countries in Asia is between 25% and 50% most of the time after February and America contributes around 40% in July 2020. The high preparedness risk contribution implies the importance of travel restrictions between those countries. The severity risk score of America and Europe contribute around 90% in December 2020, signifying that the control of COVID-19 is still worrying in America and Europe. We can keep track of the pandemic situation in each country using an online dashboard to update the pandemic risk scores and contributions.","So, Mike K P; Chu, Amanda M Y; Tiwari, Agnes; Chan, Jacky N L",Sci Rep,,415

A systematic review of individual participant data,2020,"Introduction: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected the care of patients with noncommunicable diseases, including those suffering from kidney-related ailments. Many parts of the world, including India, adopted lockdown to curb community transmission of disease. The lockdown affected transportation, access to health care facilities, and availability of medicines and consumables as well as outpatient and inpatient services. We aimed to analyze the effect of lockdown imposed due to the COVID-19 pandemic on the care of patients with kidney diseases in India. Methods: We surveyed 19 major hospitals (8 in the public and 11 in the private sector) to determine the effect of lockdown on the care of patients with kidney disease, including those on dialysis after the first 3 weeks of lockdown. Results: The total number of dialysis patients in these centers came down from 2517 to 2404. Approximately 710 (28.2%) patients missed 1 or more dialysis sessions, 69 (2.74%) required emergency dialysis sessions, 104 (4.13%) stopped reporting for dialysis, and 9 (0.36%) were confirmed to have died. Outpatient attendance in the surveyed hospital came down by 92.3%, and inpatient service reduced by 61%. Tele-consultation was started but was accessed by only a small number of patients. Conclusion: Lack of preparedness before lockdown resulted in an interruption in health care services and posed an immediate adverse effect on the outcome of dialysis patients and patients with kidney disease in India. The long-term impact on the health of patients with less severe forms of kidney disease remains unknown.","Prasad, Narayan; Bhatt, Mansi; Agarwal, Sanjay K; Kohli, H S; Gopalakrishnan, N; Fernando, Edwin; Sahay, Manisha; Rajapurkar, Mohan; Chowdhary, Arpita Roy; Rathi, Manish; Jeloka, Tarun; Lobo, Valentine; Singh, Shivendra; Bhalla, A K; Khanna, Umesh; Bansal, S B; Rai, P K; Bhawane, Amol; Anandh, Urmila; Singh, Ajit Kumar; Shah, Bharat; Gupta, Amit; Jha, Vivekanand",,,415

361970,Coincidental SARS-CoV-2 infection and mRNA vaccination: a case report addressing the most important clinical questions,2021,"Neurological symptoms occur in approximately one third of hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Among these symptoms, hypoxic encephalopathy develops in one-fifth of severe cases, while ischemic strokes due to thrombotic complications are common in one-third of COVID-19 intensive care patients. Brain involvement of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is eventuated by several routes, including hematogenous spread, trans-synaptic entry through infected neurons, olfactory nerve, ocular epithelium, vascular endothelium and impaired blood-brain barrier. Besides the high angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) binding affinity, and FURIN preactivation, SARS-CoV-2 maintains efficient neuronal entry while evading immune surveillance by utilizing basigin, and neuropilin-1 receptors. However, the neurological manifestations and their pathogenic mechanisms are still debated in COVID-19 patients.","Engin, Ayse Basak; Engin, Evren Doruk; Engin, Atilla",,,415
362200,Gaucher disease and SARS-CoV-2 infection: Experience from 181 patients in New York,2021,"Background Medical students' psychological response to societal lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic has not been studied much. Objective To assess levels of anxiety and depression among medical students during initial stages of COVID-19 pandemic in Nepal and relate their distress to relevant variables. Method A cross-sectional study with online questionnaire was conducted among medical students at different colleges in Nepal. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) detected 'anxiety' and 'depression'. The covariates were explored by logistic regression analyses. Result A total 416 medical students [mean age: 22.2 (2.1);males 57.7%, females 42.3%] participated. HADS-anxiety scores [mean: 7.1(4.3)] were significantly and positively correlated with HADS-depression [mean: 5.9 (4.1)] (r=0.695;p &lt; 0.001). Point prevalence of total HADS caseness (HADS-T) was 26.7%. Specific HADS-defined caseness were: anxiety (HADS-A) 11.8%, depression (HADS-D) 5.5%, and comorbid anxiety and depression (HADS-cAD) 9.4%. All four types of caseness were significantly more prevalent among students with a history of mental problems (AOR=4.7, 3.2, 2.6, and 3.2 respectively). HADS-T was higher among those with a concurrent physical illness (AOR=2.4). HADS-T, HADS-A and HADS-D scores were higher among the age group &gt; 22 years (AOR= 2.2, 2.5 and 4.4 respectively). HADS-cAD was almost threetimes higher among those with a possible COVID-19 exposure (AOR=2.8). Conclusion A significant number of medical students in Nepal suffered from high levels of anxiety and depression during the COVID-19 shut-down. The students in the higher (&gt; 22 years) age group, those with past mental disorders, possible COVID-19 exposure, and concurrent physical illness showed elevated levels of anxiety and/or depression.","Risal, A.; Shikhrakar, S.; Mishra, S.; Kunwar, D.; Karki, E.; Shrestha, B.; Khadka, S.; Holen, A.",Kathmandu University Medical Journal,,415

Understanding this population's epidemiological and clinical characteristics to allow outcome anticipation is crucial in healthcare resource allocation. Methods: Retrospective, multicenter (8 hospitals) study reporting on 821 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay of nasopharyngeal swabs and discharged home to self-isolate after evaluation in emergency departments (EDs) within Beaumont Health System in March, 2020. Outcomes were collected through April 14, 2020, with a minimum of 12 day follow-up and included subsequent ED visit, admission status, and mortality. Results: Of the 821 patients, mean age was 49.3 years (SD 15.7), 46.8% were male and 55.1% were African-American. Cough was the most frequent symptom in 78.2% of patients with a median duration of 3 days (IQR 2-7), and other symptoms included fever 62.1%, rhinorrhea or nasal congestion 35.1% and dyspnea 31.2%. ACEI/ARBs usage was reported in 28.7% patients and 34.0% had diabetes mellitus. Return to the ED for re-evaluation was reported in 19.2% of patients from whom 54.4% were admitted. The patients eventually admitted to the hospital were older (mean age 54.4 vs 48.7 years, p=0.002), had higher BMI (35.4 kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; vs 31.9 kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, p=0.004), were more likely male (58.1% vs 45.4%, p=0.026), and more likely to have hypertension (52.3% vs 29.4%, p&lt;0.001), diabetes mellitus (74.4% vs 29.3%, p&lt;0.001) or prediabetes (25.6% vs 8.4%, p&lt;0.001), COPD (39.5% vs 5.4%, p&lt;0.001), and OSA (36% vs 19%, p&lt;0.001). The overall mortality rate was 1.3%. Conclusion: We found that 80.8% of patients did not return to the ED for re-evaluation. Sending patients with COVID-19 home if they experience mild symptoms is a safe approach for most patients and might mitigate some of the financial and staffing pressures on healthcare systems.","Halalau, A.; Odish, F.; Imam, Z.; Sharrak, A.; Brickner, E.; Lee, P.

363578,Diagnosing myasthenic crisis in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients requires adherence to appropriate criteria,2020,"Background: CORACLE is a retrospective and prospective, regional multicenter registry, developed to evaluate risk factors for mortality in a cohort of patients admitted with SARS-CoV-2 infection within non-intensive wards. Methods: The primary objective was to estimate the role of several prognostic factors on hospital mortality in terms of adjusted Odds Ratios (aOR) with multivariable logistic regression models. Results: A total of 1538 patients were enrolled;42% were female, and 58% were &gt;70 years old. Deceased patients were 422 (27%), with a median age of 83 years (IQR (Inter Quartile Range) 76–87). Older age at admission (aOR 1.07 per year, 95%CI 1.06–1.09), diabetes (1.41, 1.02–1.94), cardiovascular disease (1.79, 1.31–2.44), immunosuppression (1.65, 1.04–2.62), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt;30 mL/min/1.73 m2 (3.53, 2.26–5.51), higher C-reactive protein values and a decreased PaO2/FiO2 ratio at admission were associated with a higher risk of hospital mortality. Amongst patients still alive on day 7, only hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) treatment was associated with reduced mortality (0.57, 0.36–0.90). Conclusions: Several risk factors were associated with mortality in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients. Although HCQ seems to be the only factor significantly associated with reduced mortality, this result is in contrast with evidence from randomized studies. These results should be interpreted in light of the study limitations.","De Rosa, Francesco Giuseppe Palazzo Annagloria Rosso Tiziana Shbaklo Nour Mussa Marco Boglione Lucio Borgogno Enrica Rossati Antonella Mornese Pinna Simone Scabini Silvia Chichino Guido Borrè Silvio Del Bono Valerio Garavelli Pietro Luigi Barillà Diego Cattel Francesco Di Perri Giovanni Ciccone Giovannino Lupia Tommaso Corcione Silvia",Journal of Clinical Medicine,,415
363685,Atypical Imaging Findings in Leukemia With SARS-CoV-2 Infection,2020,"BACKGROUND: Initial evidence from China suggests that most vulnerable subjects to COVID-19 infection suffer from pre-existing illness, including metabolic abnormalities. The pandemic characteristics and high-lethality rate of COVID-19 infection have raised concerns about interactions between virus pathobiology and components of the metabolic syndrome. METHODS: We harmonized the information from the recent existing literature on COVID-19 acute pandemic and mechanisms of damage in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), as an example of chronic (non-communicable) metabolic pandemic. RESULTS: COVID-19 patients are more fragile with underlying metabolic illness, including hypertension, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, chronic lung diseases (e.g., asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and emphysema), and metabolic syndrome. During metabolic abnormalities, expansion of metabolically active fat (""overfat condition"") parallels chronic inflammatory changes, development of insulin resistance, and accumulation of fat in configuring NAFLD. The deleterious interplay of inflammatory pathways chronically active in NAFLD and acutely in COVID-19 patients, can explain liver damage in a subgroup of patients, and might condition a worse outcome in metabolically-compromised NAFLD patients. In a subgroup of NAFLD patients, the underlying liver fibrosis might represent an additional and independent risk factor for severe COVID-19 illness, irrespective of metabolic comorbidities. CONCLUSIONS: NAFLD can play a role in the outcome of COVID-19 illness due to frequent association with comorbidities. Initial evidences suggest that increased liver fibrosis in NAFLD might affect COVID-19 outcome. In addition, long-term monitoring of post-COVID-19 NAFLD patients is advisable, to document further deterioration of liver damage. Further studies are required in this field.","Portincasa, Piero; Krawczyk, Marcin; Smyk, Wiktor; Lammert, Frank; Di Ciaula, Agostino",Eur J Clin Invest,,415

365482,Are presymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections in nursing home residents unrecognized symptomatic infections? Sequence and metadata from weekly testing in an extensive nursing home outbreak,2021,"The COVID-19-, SARS- and MERS-related coronaviruses share many genomic and structural similarities. However, the SARS-CoV-2 is less pathogenic than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Despite some differences in the cytokine patterns, it seems that the cytokine storm plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19-, SARS- and MERS. Monocytes and macrophages may be infected by SARS-CoV-2 through ACE2-dependent and ACE2-independent pathways. SARS-CoV-2 can effectively suppress the anti-viral IFN response in monocytes and macrophages. Since macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) act as antigen presenting cells (APCs), the infection of these cells by SARS-CoV-2 impairs the adaptive immune responses against the virus. Upon infection, monocytes migrate to the tissues where they become infected resident macrophages, allowing viruses to spread through all organs and tissues. The SARS-CoV-2-infected monocytes and macrophages can produce large amounts of numerous types of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which contribute to local tissue inflammation and a dangerous systemic inflammatory response called cytokine storm. Both local tissue inflammation and the cytokine storm play a fundamental role in the development of COVID-19-related complications, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is a main cause of death in COVID-19 patients. Here, we describe the monocytes and macrophage responses during severe coronavirus infections, while highlighting potential therapeutic interventions to attenuate macrophage-related inflammatory reactions in possible approaches for COVID-19 treatment.","Jafarzadeh, Abdollah; Chauhan, Prashant; Saha, Bhaskar; Jafarzadeh, Sara; Nemati, Maryam",Life Sci,,415

Few studies have been conducted examining the psychological effect of COVID-19 on health-care worker psychological health in Jordan. Therefore, the present study aims to assess the respective levels of fear, anxiety, depression, stress, social support, and the associated factors, experienced by Jordanian health-care workers during the COVID-19 Pandemic. This study adopted a cross-sectional, correlational design to collect data from 365 health-care workers in Amman, Jordan, from August 16th to 23rd, 2020. Along with collecting sociodemographic characteristics, the Fear of COVID-19 Scale, the Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale, and the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support electronically administered to participants. The majority of the participants (69.3%) were registered nurses. The mean overall score for the Fear of COVID-19 scale was 23.64 (SD + 6.85) which again exceeded the mid-point for the total score range (21), indicating elevated level fear of the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants had displayed extremely severe depression 40%, extremely severe anxiety 60%, and 35% severely distressed. Scores for depression (21.30 ± 10.86), anxiety (20.37 ± 10.80), stress (23.33 ± 10.87) were also high. Factors determined to be associated with psychological distress were being male, married, aged 40 years and older, and having more clinical experience. Assessment of social support indicated moderate-to-high levels of perceived support for all dimensions (significant other: 5.17 ± 1.28, family: 5.03 ± 1.30, friends: 5.05 ± 1.30). Weak significant correlations were found between social support and the other study variables (r < 0.22), indicating a weak association with fear, depression, anxiety, and stress, respectively. Overall, Jordanian health-care workers sample reported fear, depression, anxiety, and stress. The associated factors were being male, married, aged 40 years and older, and having more clinical experience. Regarding social support, participants primarily relied on support from their families, followed by support from friends.","Alnazly, Eman; Khraisat, Omar M; Al-Bashaireh, Ahmad M; Bryant, Christine L",PLoS One,,415
367063,Fatal meningococaemia in a SARS-CoV-2-positive adolescent,2021,"We combine infectious disease transmission and the non-pharmaceutical (NPI) intervention response to disease incidence into one closed model consisting of two coupled delay differential equations for the incidence rate and the time-dependent reproduction number. The model contains three parameters, the initial reproduction number, the intervention strength, and the response delay. The response is modeled by assuming that the rate of change of the reproduction number is proportional to the negative deviation of the incidence rate from an intervention threshold. This delay dynamical system exhibits damped oscillations in one part of the parameter space, and growing oscillations in another, and these are separated by a surface where the solution is a strictly periodic nonlinear oscillation. For the COVID-19 pandemic, the tipping transition from damped to growing oscillations occurs for response delays of about one week, and suggests that, without vaccination, effective control and mitigation of successive epidemic waves cannot be achieved unless NPIs are implemented in a precautionary manner, rather as a response to the present incidence rate. Vaccination increases the quiet intervals between waves, but with delayed response, future flare-ups can only be prevented by establishing a post-pandemic normal with lower basic reproduction number.","Rypdal, Kristoffer",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,415

We aimed at describing COVID-19 infections in the French cohort of lung transplant (LT) patients. METHODS: Multicenter nationwide cohort study of all LT recipients with COVID-19 diagnosed from March 1 to May 19, 2020. Recipient main characteristics and their management were retrieved. Hospitalization characteristics, occurrence of complications and survival were analyzed. RESULTS: Thirty-five LT patients with a COVID-19 infection were included. Median age was 50.4 [40.6-62.9] years, 16 (45.7%) were female, and 80% were double-LT recipients. Infection was community-acquired in 25 (71.4%). Thirty-one (88.6%) required hospitalization, including 13 (41.9%) in the intensive care unit. The main symptoms of COVID-19 were fever, cough, and diarrhea, present in 71.4%, 54.3%, and 31.4% of cases, respectively. Extension of pneumonia on chest CT was moderate to severe in 51.4% of cases.

369126,Body temperature and host species preferences of SARS-CoV-2,2020,"BACKGROUND: Executive functions (EF) support engagement in goal-directed behaviors, including several health behaviors. Stressful and cognitively demanding events can disrupt EFs and interfere with health behavior, possibly to a greater extent in those with preexisting EF deficits. This study examined the association between preexisting EF deficits and subsequent negative changes in eating patterns, physical activity, sedentariness, and alcohol/substance use during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: Participants were 374 young adults in a follow-up study of the longitudinal, multisite Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (SECCYD). Preexisting EF deficits were assessed with the Barkley Deficits in Executive Function Scales-Short Form, and personally impactful negative changes in four health behaviors (physical activity, unhealthy eating, sedentary time, alcohol/substance use) during the COVID-19 pandemic were subsequently assessed with the Epidemic-Pandemic Impacts Inventory. RESULTS: In ordered logistic regression models, higher preexisting total EF deficits were associated with greater negative impactful changes in physical activity and unhealthy eating, independent of sociodemographic variables, obesity, and (as relevant) accelerometer-based physical activity and pre-COVID-19 diet quality. Socioeconomic status moderated the association between total EF deficits and impactful change in alcohol/substance use, with EF deficits linked to greater impactful change in alcohol/substance use only in higher socioeconomic strata. CONCLUSION: Individuals with preexisting EF deficits appear more vulnerable to the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on several key health behaviors. As the pandemic unfolds, strategies may be needed to identify those with EF deficits (e.g., screening tools) and provide them with tailored support for chronic disease risk reduction.","Appelhans, Bradley M; Thomas, Alexis S; Roisman, Glenn I; Booth-LaForce, Cathryn; Bleil, Maria E",Int. j. behav. med,,415

374205,"[Epidemiology, clinical manifestations and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children]",2021,"Background Pre-Delta, vaccination reduced SARS-CoV-2 transmission from individuals infected despite vaccination, potentially via reducing viral loads. While vaccination still lowers the risk of infection, similar viral loads in vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals infected with Delta question how much vaccination prevents transmission. Methods We performed a retrospective observational cohort study of adult contacts of SARS-CoV-2-infected adult index cases using English contact testing data. We used multivariable Poisson regression to investigate associations between transmission and index case and contact vaccination, and how these vary with Alpha and Delta variants (classified using S-gene detection/calendar trends) and time since second vaccination. Results 54,667/146,243(37.4%) PCR-tested contacts of 108,498 index cases were PCR-positive. Two doses of BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1 vaccines in Alpha index cases were independently associated with reduced PCR-positivity in contacts (aRR, adjusted rate ratio vs. unvaccinated=0.32[95%CI 0.21-0.48] and 0.48[0.30-0.78] respectively). The Delta variant attenuated vaccine-associated reductions in transmission: two BNT162b2 doses reduced Delta transmission (aRR=0.50[0.39-0.65]), more than ChAdOx1 (aRR=0.76[0.70-0.82]). Variation in Ct values (indicative of viral load) explained 7-23% of vaccine-associated transmission reductions. Transmission reductions declined over time post-second vaccination, for Delta reaching similar levels to unvaccinated individuals by 12 weeks for ChAdOx1 and attenuating substantially for BNT162b2. Protection in contacts also declined in the 3 months post-second vaccination. Conclusions Vaccination reduces transmission of Delta, but by less than the Alpha variant. The impact of vaccination decreased over time. Factors other than PCR Ct values at diagnosis are important in understanding vaccine-associated transmission reductions. Booster vaccinations may help control transmission together with preventing infections.","Eyre, David W; Taylor, Donald; Purver, Mark; Chapman, David; Fowler, Tom; Pouwels, Koen; Walker, Ann Sarah; Peto, Tim EA",,,415

As a natural bioactive substance, resveratrol shows potential capability to prevent or suppress the development of a variety of cancers through direct or indirect effects, including immunoregulatory effect. However, whether resveratrol might affect lung metastasis of TNBC, and whether the effect of resveratrol might be associated with resveratrol-regulated immune responses in tumor microenvironment is still unknown. In this study, by using an experimental metastatic mouse 4 T1 tumor model, we identified that resveratrol may suppress TNBC lung metastasis by elevating local anti-tumor immunity. Indeed, an increase in the cytotoxic activity of CD8+T cells as well as the levels of type 1 cytokine IFN-Î³ and IL-2 in the lungs of resveratrol-treated tumor bearing mice were observed. The enhanced CD8+T cell activity and Th1 immune responses by resveratrol administration might be related to the down-regulated PD-1 expression on pulmonary CD8+T cells and CD4+T cells. Resveratrol may also convert macrophages to M1 phenotype in the lungs of tumor bearing mice. However, it seems likely resveratrol has no effect on pulmonary myeloid-derived suppressor cell activation. Our results provide an evidence that resveratrol might be a promising candidate agent for adjuvant therapy in the process of TNBC metastasis.","Han, Xu; Zhao, Na; Zhu, Wenwen; Wang, Jia; Liu, Beixing; Teng, Yuee",Cell Immunol,,415

Patients with COVID-19 are at an increased risk of co-morbidities associated with liver dysfunction and injury. Moreover, hepatotoxicity induced by antiviral therapy is gaining importance and is an area of great concern. Currently, alternatives therapies are being sought to mitigate hepatic damage, and there has been growing interest in the research on bioactive phytochemical agents (nutraceuticals) due to their versatility in health benefits reported in various epidemiological studies. Therefore, this review provides information and summarizes the juncture of antiviral, immunomodulatory, and hepatoprotective nutraceuticals that can be useful during the management of COVID-19.","Sikander, Mohammed; Malik, Shabnam; Rodriguez, Anyssa; Yallapu, Murali M; Narula, Acharan S; Satapathy, Sanjaya K; Dhevan, Vijian; Chauhan, Subhash C; Jaggi, Meena",Molecules (Basel),,415

Although African governments and other stakeholders are making efforts to contain the pandemic, the outbreak continues to impact human rights and exacerbates inequalities and disparities that are already in existence. The concept of inclusive health focuses on good health and well-being for everyone, and this entails health services that are equitable, affordable, and efficacious. Creating equitable access to mainstream health and healthcare services and ensuring inclusive health responses remain a means of addressing health inequities and disparities. In this article, we argue on the need for inclusive responses to public health emergencies in Africa using COVID-19 as a case example. Africa's response to public health emergencies needs to recognize that for every marginalized/vulnerable group, it is important to strategize to address their particular needs in such a way to surmount any barrier to the right to health. For Africa's public health response to be more inclusive, we therefore need to be more strategic and proactive in reaching out to specific groups and to identify and address their needs. Strengthening the healthcare systems of African countries through increased political will, increased funding to health care, collaboration and cooperation among stakeholders, and effective leadership remains essential in ensuring inclusive responses to health emergencies","Adebisi, Y.

Therefore, renewable energy projects are losing their competitiveness. This endangers the achievement of several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. Various consulting companies define the SDGs differently. Institutional investors hire consulting companies and allocate their investment based on the consultants' suggestions. This paper theoretically shows that the current allocation of investors by considering SDG based on various consulting companies will lead to distortion in the investment portfolio. The desired portfolio allocation can be achieved by taxing pollution and waste such as CO2, NOx, and plastics, globally with the same tax rate. Global taxation on pollution will lead to the desired portfolio allocation of assets.","Yoshino, Naoyuki; Taghizadeh-Hesary, Farhad; Otsuka, Miyu",Financ Res Lett,,415

The COVID-19 vaccine candidates currently in phase 3 or phase 2/3 clinical trials as well as those that recently received emergency use authorization (EUA) from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and/or other regulatory agencies worldwide require either cold (i.e., 2-8°C) or even freezing temperatures as low as -70°C for storage and distribution. Thus, existing cold chain will struggle to support both the standard national immunization programs and COVID-19 vaccination. The requirement for cold chain is now a major challenge towards worldwide rapid mass vaccination against COVID-19. In this commentary, we stress that thermostabilizing technologies are available to enable cold chain-free vaccine storage and distribution, as well as potential needle-free vaccination. Significant efforts on thermostabilizing technologies must now be applied on next-generation COVID-19 vaccines for more cost-effective worldwide mass vaccination and COVID-19 eradication.","AboulFotouh, Khaled; Cui, Zhengrong; Williams, Robert O",AAPS PharmSciTech,,415

Extensive numerical analysis based on transfer matrix theory as well as finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) technique has been performed to characterize the sensor response considering sensitivity, full width at half maxima, and minimum reflection. About 7.6 times enhanced sensitivity has been obtained using the proposed architecture for SARS-CoV-2 detection, compared to the basic Kretschmann configuration. Notably, the structure provides consistent enhancement over other competitive SPR structures for both angular and wavelength interrogations with a figure-of-merit of 692.28. Additionally, we repeated simulations for various ligate-ligand pairs to assess the range of applicability and robust performance improvement has been observed. As a result, the proposed sensor design provides a suitable configuration for highly sensitive, rapid, non-invasive biosensing which can be useful if adopted in experimental sensing protocols.","Uddin, Syed Mohammad Ashab; Chowdhury, Sayeed Shafayet; Kabir, Ehsan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.10354v1.pdf,415

While people must stay at home to reduce the spread of this virus health-care workers do the exact opposite. In some countries doctors are working with insufficient protection and are constantly at risk of contracting Covid-19. Health-care workers should be constantly monitored because if they are infected they may spread the virus to colleagues, hospitalized patients and even family members.

388999,SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Children: Special Considerations,2020,"Memes in popular culture are defined as an amusing or interesting item (such as a captioned picture or video) or genre of items that is spread widely online, especially through social media. In the Spring of 2020 biological memes became an integral aspect of my small 400-level Cancer Biology course at Westminster College, organically developing as a course component through student initiative. One individual emailed the students and instructor a single meme tying the movie Shrek to the tumor suppressor p21, and this new method of learning and reviewing content quickly became an embedded aspect of the course. For the remainder of the semester students were encouraged (but not required) to add memes to an email thread as new content was learned. In addition, exam questions were used where the students used a provided meme to explain a particular concept. An end of semester survey was conducted to assess the students? perceptions on the effect of memes on their ability to learn and review concepts. 60% of students indicated that they created memes (developing between 3 and 10 during the course of the semester) and 100% reviewed the memes of others. Likert scale rankings (1-5, strongly disagree to strongly agree) indicated that students believed that creating memes helped them learn (4.1) and review (4.2) course content, which was at a level just below the use of course notes (4.5). Similarly, they felt that reviewing the memes of others helped them to study content (4.3) comparable to making diagrams or reviewing notes (4.6). In addition to these potential academic benefits, meme use also helped to build a course community, one that became essential in the wake of a mid-semester transition to online learning because of the Covid-19 pandemic. This community building effect was likely due in part to students creating memes about the course experience in addition to those directly related to content. All of the students strongly agreed that meme bolstered a sense of class community both within and outside of the classroom. Furthermore, when the course transitioned online 90% of students strongly agreed that memes helped to maintain this community. This student initiated active learning methodology has since led to the incorporation of meme use in other courses at Westminster, as bonus activities to supplement learning. This presentation will look at the initial assessment of meme use, provide examples of course generated memes and student interpretations of their meaning, discuss possible future usage of memes as a learning tool, and explore plans to broaden research into the effectiveness of this methodology for engaging students with each other and their learning.","Resendes, Karen",The FASEB Journal,,415

Thus, JPT2 is a component of the NAADP receptor complex that is essential for TPC-dependent Ca2+ signaling and control of coronaviral entry.","Gunaratne, Gihan S; Brailoiu, Eugen; He, Shijun; Unterwald, Ellen M; Patel, Sandip; Slama, James T; Walseth, Timothy F; Marchant, Jonathan S",Sci. signal,,415

393157,Important Concerns Over SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Children With Cancer-Reply,2020,"BACKGROUND: The hemostatic balance in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) seems to be shifted toward a hypercoagulable state. The aim of the current study was to assess the associated coagulation alterations by point-of-care-diagnostics, focusing on details of clot formation and lysis in these severely affected patients. METHODS: The authors' prospective monocentric observational study included critically ill patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Demographics and biochemical data were recorded. To assess the comprehensive hemostatic profile of this patient population, aggregometric (Multiplate) and viscoelastometric (CloPro) measures were performed in the intensive care unit of a university hospital at a single occasion. Coagulation analysis and assessment of coagulation factors were performed. Data were compared to healthy controls. RESULTS: In total, 27 patients (21 male; mean age, 60 yr) were included. Impedance aggregometry displayed no greater platelet aggregability in COVID-19 in comparison with healthy controls (area under the curve [AUC] in adenosine diphosphate test, 68 ± 37 U vs. 91 ± 29 U [-27 (Hodges-Lehmann 95% CI, -48 to -1); P = 0.043]; AUC in arachidonic acid test, 102 ± 54 U vs. 115 ± 26 U [-21 (Hodges-Lehmann 95% CI, -51 to 21); P = 0.374]; AUC in thrombin receptor activating peptide 6 test, 114 ± 61 U vs. 144 ± 31 U [-31 (Hodges-Lehmann 95% CI, -69 to -7); P = 0.113]). Comparing the thromboelastometric results of COVID-19 patients to healthy controls, the authors observed significant differences in maximum clot firmness in fibrin contribution to maximum clot firmness assay (37 ± 11 mm vs. 15 ± 4 mm [21 (Hodges-Lehmann 95% CI, 17 to 26); P < 0.001]) and lysis time in extrinsic activation and activation of fibrinolysis by tissue plasminogen activator assay (530 ± 327 s vs. 211 ± 80 s [238 (Hodges-Lehmann 95% CI, 160 to 326); P < 0.001]). CONCLUSIONS: Thromboelastometry in COVID-19 patients revealed greater fibrinolysis resistance. The authors did not find a greater platelet aggregability based on impedance aggregometric tests. These findings may contribute to our understanding of the hypercoagulable state of critically ill patients with COVID-19.","Heinz, Christoph; Miesbach, Wolfgang; Herrmann, Eva; Sonntagbauer, Michael; Raimann, Florian J; Zacharowski, Kai; Weber, Christian F; Adam, Elisabeth H",Anesthesiology,,415
393817,"Characteristics of Clinically Asymptomatic Patients with SARS-CoV-2 Infections, Case Series",2021,"COVID-19 has modified numerous aspects of children's social environments. Many children are now spoken to through a mask. There is little empirical evidence attesting to the effects of masked language input on language processing. In addition, not much is known about the effects of clear masks (i.e., transparent face shields) versus opaque masks on language comprehension in children. In the current study, 2-year-old infants were tested on their ability to recognize familiar spoken words in three conditions: words presented with no mask, words presented through a clear mask, and words presented through an opaque mask. Infants were able to recognize familiar words presented without a mask and when hearing words through opaque masks, but not when hearing words through clear masks. Findings suggest that the ability of infants to recover spoken language input through masks varies depending on the surface properties of the mask.","Singh, Leher; Tan, Agnes; Quinn, Paul C",Dev. sci,,415

394134,Evaluation of coronavirus in tears and conjunctival secretions of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection,2020,"There is a growing consensus that the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of melatonin are of great importance in preserving the body functions and homeostasis, with great impact in the peripartum period and adult life. Melatonin promotes adaptation through allostasis and stands out as an endogenous, dietary, and therapeutic molecule with important health benefits. The anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of melatonin are intertwined and are exerted throughout pregnancy and later during development and aging. Melatonin supplementation during pregnancy can reduce ischemia-induced oxidative damage in the fetal brain, increase offspring survival in inflammatory states, and reduce blood pressure in the adult offspring. In adulthood, disturbances in melatonin production negatively impact the progression of cardiovascular risk factors and promote cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. The most studied cardiovascular effects of melatonin are linked to hypertension and myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury, while the most promising ones are linked to regaining control of metabolic syndrome components. In addition, there might be an emerging role for melatonin as an adjuvant in treating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19). The present review summarizes and comments on important data regarding the roles exerted by melatonin in homeostasis and oxidative stress and inflammation related pathologies.","Chitimus, Diana Maria; Popescu, Mihaela Roxana; Voiculescu, Suzana Elena; Panaitescu, Anca Maria; Pavel, Bogdan; Zagrean, Leon; Zagrean, Ana-Maria",Biomolecules,,415

Although some developed countries have a very high testing rate and subsequently a high number of confirmed cases, less developed countries have a low testing rate and an illusive positivity rate. Collection of the upper respiratory specimen is not often comfortable. The discomfort could be accompanied with epistaxis and headache in some patients. The trained personnel taking the swab is forced to protect self with personal protective equipment (PPE) to avoid infections that may result from the patient due to provoked cough, sneezing and spitting. This study looks into an efficient means of increasing the testing rate for COVID 19 without compromising the quality. A literature review was conducted on the different modalities of collecting upper respiratory specimens and assessing the efficacy of samples collected using different methods in terms of the laboratory yield of different pathogens. Self-collection of upper respiratory tract specimen for diagnostic purposes is not new. Studies have demonstrated that trained staff-collected nasal swabs are not in any way superior to self-collected or parent-assisted swabs. The laboratory yield of different specimens is not determined by who took the sample but by the anatomical site from where the specimen was collected. Self collection of the upper respiratory swabs will not only increase the testing rate but also preserve the scarce PPE and reduces health care worker's COVID 19 infection rate in South Africa.","Adeniji, Adeloye A",Afr J Prim Health Care Fam Med,,415

Subject and methods: The study adopted qualitative and interpretative methods of social research, including content analysis and a perception study of 223 respondents through a semi-structured questionnaire survey, who were selected using purposive random sampling. The data obtained from the perception study was further complemented through phone interviews. Results: The study found that the pandemic has not affected all mothers uniformly; rather, the intensity of its impact varied depending on factors such as the occupation of mothers and their husbands and their family pattern. Despite such variation, all mothers experienced a subsequent increase in workload, challenges while availing routine health facilities and higher levels of stress, anxiety, depression and certain behavioural changes. Conclusion: However, the worst affected have been the mothers belonging to the lower socio-economic strata because the pandemic has made them and their husbands jobless, leading them towards an uncertain future.","Ehsan, Shah Md Azimul; Jahan, Fairooz",Z Gesundh Wiss,,415

METHODS: A total of 50 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection were included in our study. For each patient we evaluated the short version of the Questionnaire of Olfactory Disorders-Negative Statements (sQOD-NS), the Summated Xerostomia Inventory-Dutch Version (SXI-DV), The Standardized Patient Evaluation of Eye Dryness (SPEED), Schirmer test I, the Hearing Handicap Inventory For Adults (HHIA) and the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI). All the tests we carried out were performed during the active phase of the symptomatology from COVID-19 (Condition A) and 15 after SARS-COV-2 RT-PCR test negative (Condition B). RESULTS: A total of 46 patients (92%) had olfactory dysfunction related to the infection. The 70% of patients reported gustatory disorders. Cough, fever, headache and asthenia were the most prevalent symptoms. There was a statistically significant difference (p < 0,001) in sQOD-NS, SXI-DV, SPEED, Schirmer test, HHIA and THI between Condition A and Condition B. CONCLUSIONS: In our population there was an alteration of the sense of taste, of the sense of smell, dry eyes and of the oral cavity and an auditory discomfort, symptoms probably linked to the neurotropism of the virus. Furthermore, anosmia, dysgeusia and xerostomia are early symptoms of COVID-19, which can be exploited for an early quarantine and a limitation of viral contagion.","Freni, Francesco; Meduri, Alessandro; Gazia, Francesco; Nicastro, Viviana; Galletti, Cosimo; Aragona, Pasquale; Galletti, Bruno; Galletti, Francesco",Am J Otolaryngol,,415

In this study, a mouse model combining disease with syndrome of human coronavirus pneumonia with pestilence attacking the lung syndrome was used to evaluate the effectiveness of Reyanning Mixture to provide animal experimental support for clinical application. Mice were divided into normal group, 229 E infection group, cold-dampness group, cold-dampness+229 E infection group(the model group), Reyanning high and low dose groups. The cold-dampness group, cold-dampness+229 E infection group, two Reyanning groups were given cold and damp stimulation for 7 days. On the 5 th day, the 229 E infection group, cold-dampness+229 E infection group, and two Reyanning groups were infected with HCoV-229 E virus. Reyanning was administered for 3 days, starting from the day of infection. Blood was collected on the 4 th day and the lung tissue was dissected to calculate the lung index and inhibition rate; flow cytometry was used to detect the percentage of T and B lymphocytes in peripheral blood; RT-PCR was used to detect the nucleic acid virus load in lung tissue; ELISA was used to detect motilin and gastrin in serum, and inflammatory factors TNF-&#945;, IFN-Î³, IL-6, IL-10 in lung tissue proteins. Reyanning Mixture could reduce the lung index(P<0.01) of coronavirus pneumonia mice with pestilence attacking the lung; it could significantly increase the percentage of CD8~+ T lymphocytes and CD4~+ T lymphocytes in peripheral blood of model mice(P<0.05, P<0.01). The low dose of Reyanning could effectively increase the percentage of total B lymphocytes(P<0.05), reduce virus load in lung tissue of model mice(P<0.01), reduce the levels of TNF-&#945;, IFN-Î³, IL-6, IL-10 in the lung tissue of model mice(P<0.01), reduce the content of motilin in the serum of model mice(P<0.01). Reyanning Mixture convey a better effect in treating coronavirus pneumonia mice with pestilence attacking the lung. It manifested obvious effects in improving lung lesions, enhancing the gastrointestinal function of mice, improving the autoimmune function of mice, and reducing the expression of inflammatory factors in vivo, which could provide evidences for clinical research.","Bao, Lei; Shi, Yu-Jing; Geng, Zi-Han; Sun, Jing; Zhao, Rong-Hua; DU, Cheng-Qiang; Chu, Ya-Jun; Cui, Xiao-Lan",Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi,,415

Under these circumstances, vaccination is the only effective solution that can save millions of lives across the globe. Objectives: The present study was conducted to assess the attitude and acceptance/willingness of health care professionals (medical and dental) towards COVID-19 vaccine. Materials and Methods: An online questionnaire survey was conducted among medical and dental professionals working in different hospitals of two states of India. A total of 520 subjects constituted the final sample size. A self-constructed questionnaire (divided into 2 parts) containing 12 questions was administered to obtain information from the subjects regarding their attitude and willingness towards COVID 19 vaccine. Statistical analysis was done using chi-square test and multiple liner regression analysis. Odds ratio with 95% CI were also generated. Statistical significance was set at p&#8804;0.05. Results: Majority of the subjects (67% of dental and 73% of medical) had full confidence on the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccine. Willingness to get vaccinated was shown by 63% of subjects and 65% had positive attitude towards vaccine. Some subjects (45.5% dental and 48.4% medical) showed concern regarding unforeseen effects of the vaccine. Willingness to get vaccinated was 3.45 higher in subjects who were involved in COVID duties. Subjects giving less preference to natural immunity over vaccine showed more willingness (OR: 2.98) towards getting the vaccine. Conclusion: The findings of the study showed that acceptance and attitude of subjects regarding COVID 19 vaccine was suboptimal as there were various factors which contributed towards subjects' hesitancy to get vaccinated. There is an utmost need to address various issues regarding vaccine safety to promote high uptake.","Kaur, Avineet; Kaur, Gagandeep; Kashyap, Akanksha; Singh, Gaganpreet; Singh Sandhu, Harnoor; Khilji, Iqra; Singh Gambhir, Ramandeep",Rocz Panstw Zakl Hig,,415

We identified symptom burden, management, response to treatment, and outcomes for a case series of 101 inpatients with confirmed COVID-19 referred to hospital palliative care. Patients (64 men, median [interquartile range {IQR}] age 82 [72-89] years, Elixhauser Comorbidity Index 6 [2-10], Australian-modified Karnofsky Performance Status 20 [10-20]) were most frequently referred for end-of-life care or symptom control. Median [IQR] days from hospital admission to referral was 4 [1-12] days. Most prevalent symptoms (n) were breathlessness (67), agitation (43), drowsiness (36), pain (23), and delirium (24). Fifty-eight patients were prescribed a subcutaneous infusion. Frequently used medicines (median [range] dose/24 hours) were opioids (morphine, 10 [5-30] mg; fentanyl, 100 [100-200] mcg; alfentanil, 500 [150-1000] mcg) and midazolam (10 [5-20] mg). Infusions were assessed as at least partially effective for 40/58 patients, while 13 patients died before review. Patients spent a median [IQR] of 2 [1-4] days under the palliative care team, who made 3 [2-5] contacts across patient, family, and clinicians. At March 30, 2020, 75 patients had died; 13 been discharged back to team, home, or hospice; and 13 continued to receive inpatient palliative care. Palliative care is an essential component to the COVID-19 response, and teams must rapidly adapt with new ways of working. Breathlessness and agitation are common but respond well to opioids and benzodiazepines. Availability of subcutaneous infusion pumps is essential. An international minimum data set for palliative care would accelerate finding answers to new questions as the COVID-19 pandemic develops.","Lovell, Natasha; Maddocks, Matthew; Etkind, Simon N; Taylor, Katie; Carey, Irene; Vora, Vandana; Marsh, Lynne; Higginson, Irene J; Prentice, Wendy; Edmonds, Polly; Sleeman, Katherine E",J Pain Symptom Manage,,415
407609,Prior Covid-19 and high RBD-IgG levels correlate with protection against VOC-delta SARS-CoV-2 infection in vaccinated Nursing Home Residents,2021,"Patients with diabetes have been reported to have enhanced susceptibility to severe or fatal COVID-19 infections, including a high risk of being admitted to intensive care units with respiratory failure and septic complications. Given the global prevalence of diabetes, affecting over 450 million people worldwide and still on the rise, the emerging COVID-19 crisis poses a serious threat to an extremely large vulnerable population. However, the broad heterogeneity and complexity of this dysmetabolic condition, with reference to etiologic mechanisms, degree of glycemic derangement and comorbid associations, along with the extensive sexual dimorphism in immune responses, can hamper any patient generalization. Even more relevant, and irrespective of glucose-lowering activities, DPP4 inhibitors and GLP1 receptor agonists may have a favorable impact on the modulation of viral entry and overproduction of inflammatory cytokines during COVID-19 infection, although current evidence is limited and not univocal. Conversely, SGLT2 inhibitors may increase the likelihood of COVID-19-related ketoacidosis decompensation among patients with severe insulin deficiency. Mindful of their widespread popularity in the management of diabetes, addressing potential benefits and harms of novel antidiabetic drugs to clinical prognosis at the time of a COVID-19 pandemic deserves careful consideration.","Mirabelli, Maria; Chiefari, Eusebio; Puccio, Luigi; Foti, Daniela Patrizia; Brunetti, Antonio",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,415

We used an innovative online diary instrument that has proved both reliable and quick-to-field. Combining diary information on activity, location, and co-presence to estimate infection risks associated with daily behavior, we show clear changes in risk-associated behavior between the pre, full-lockdown and post full-lockdown periods. We document a shift from more to less risky daily behavior patterns (combinations of activity/location/co-presence categories) between the pre-pandemic pattern and full lockdown in May/June 2020, followed by a reversion (although not a complete reversal) of those patterns in August 2020 following the end of the first lockdown. Because, in general, a populations' time use changes relatively slowly, the behavioral changes revealed may be interpreted as a consequence of the UK COVID-19 lockdown social restrictions and their subsequent relaxation.","Gershuny, J.; Sullivan, O.; Sevilla, A.; Vega-Rapun, M.; Foliano, F.; Grignon, J.

Although computed tomography remains the gold standard for diagnosing lung diseases, its usefulness for infected, critically ill patients has been largely limited during the pandemic. Reports from those countries in which the healthcare systems were most seriously overloaded with patients with COVID-19-induced pneumonia stress the key role of point-of-care lung ultrasound performed by clinicians first during preliminary diagnostics and then while monitoring disease dynamics. This consensus, worked out by an interdisciplinary team of specialists forming the Study Group for Point-of-Care Lung Ultrasound in the Intensive Care Management of COVID-19 Patients, presents a broad spectrum of aspects regarding the analysed issue.

We hypothesized that lung and cardiac ultrasound examinations, serially and simultaneously performed, could monitor disease severity in COVID-related ARDS. METHODS: We enrolled 47 consecutive patients with COVID-related ARDS (1st March-31st May 2020). Lung and cardiac ultrasounds were performed on admission, at discharged and when clinically needed. RESULTS: Most patients were mechanically ventilated (75%) and veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was needed in ten patients (21.2%). The in-ICU mortality rate was 27%%. On admission, not survivors showed a higher LUS score (p = 0.006) and a higher incidence of consolidations (p = 0.003), lower values of LVEF (p = 0.027) and a higher RV/LV ratio (0.008). At discharge, a significant reduction in the incidence of subpleural consolidations (p < 0.001) and, thus, in LUS score (p < 0.001) and an increase in patter A findings (p < 0.001) together with reduced systolic pulmonary arterial pressures were detectable.

412904,High SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in health care workers but relatively low numbers of deaths in urban Malawi,2020,"Cell entry of SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus causing COVID-19, is facilitated by host cell angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2). We aimed to identify and characterize genes that are co-expressed with ACE2 and TMPRSS2, and to further explore their biological functions and potential as druggable targets. Using the gene expression profiles of 1,038 lung tissue samples, we performed a weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) to identify modules of co-expressed genes. We explored the biology of co-expressed genes using bioinformatics databases, and identified known drug-gene interactions. ACE2 was in a module of 681 co-expressed genes; 10 genes with moderate-high correlation with ACE2 (r > 0.3, FDR < 0.05) had known interactions with existing drug compounds. TMPRSS2 was in a module of 1,086 co-expressed genes; 31 of these genes were enriched in the gene ontology biologic process 'receptor-mediated endocytosis', and 52 TMPRSS2-correlated genes had known interactions with drug compounds. Dozens of genes are co-expressed with ACE2 and TMPRSS2, many of which have plausible links to COVID-19 pathophysiology. Many of the co-expressed genes are potentially targetable with existing drugs, which may accelerate the development of COVID-19 therapeutics.","Hernández Cordero, Ana I; Li, Xuan; Yang, Chen Xi; Milne, Stephen; Bossé, Yohan; Joubert, Philippe; Timens, Wim; van den Berge, Maarten; Nickle, David; Hao, Ke; Sin, Don D",Sci Rep,,415

417439,Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in Palestine: A Cross-Sectional Seroepidemiological Study (preprint),2020,"Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) raised many questions needing answers in order to overcome the disease burden globally. Uncertainty about COVID-19 contributes to the complexity of the burden on the health, social, economic, and cultural influences of COVID-19. In this context, all related disciplines are working together to mitigate the negative influences of the disease. In particular, health promotion, a discipline of public health, matters to the pandemic as it may address the threats at different levels. Health promotion strategies mostly use solution-oriented efforts with inter- and multidisciplinary approaches. Nevertheless, as the COVID-19 burden has many time-critical determinants, these approaches cannot be sufficient to overcome the problem. A transdisciplinary approach in its broader sense using almost all inputs to synthesize and produce an integrative solution may be extremely helpful. In this paper, the importance of transdisciplinary approaches in health promotion to combat COVID-19 has been discussed.","Aslan, Dilek",Glob Health Promot,,415

Use of real-time continuous glucose monitoring (rtCGM) helped manage diabetes effectively. Some of these disruptions may be reflected in population-scale changes to metrics of glycemic control, such as time-in-range (TIR). Methods: We examined data from 65,067 U.S.-based users of the G6 rtCGM System (Dexcom, Inc., San Diego, CA) who had uploaded data before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Users associated with three counties that included the cities of Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York or with five regions designated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) were compared. Public data were used to associate regions with prepandemic and intrapandemic glycemic parameters, COVID-19 mortality, and median household income. Results: Compared with an 8-week prepandemic interval before stay-at-home orders (January 6, 2020, to March 1, 2020), overall mean (standard deviation) TIR improved from 59.0 (20.1)% to 61.0 (20.4)% during the early pandemic period (April 20, 2020 to June 14, 2020, P < 0.001). TIR improvements were noted in all three counties and in all five CDC-designated regions. Higher COVID-19 mortality was associated with higher proportions of individuals experiencing TIR improvements of &#8805;5 percentage points. Users in economically wealthier zip codes had higher pre- and intrapandemic TIR values and greater relative improvements in TIR. TIR and pandemic-related improvements in TIR varied across CDC-designated regions. Conclusions: Population-level rtCGM data may be used to monitor changes in glycemic control with temporal and geographic specificity. The COVID-19 pandemic is associated with improvements in TIR, which were not evenly distributed across the United States.","van der Linden, Joost; Welsh, John B; Hirsch, Irl B; Garg, Satish K",Diabetes Technol Ther,,415

METHODS: An online questionnaire with sociodemographic and COVID-19 knowledge questions was used. RESULTS: A total of 4048 dentists working in the Brazilian public primary and secondary health care system were investigated; 4024 (99.41%) believe that COVID-19 can be transmitted through dental procedures. A fair level of COVID-19 symptoms knowledge by these dentists was observed (3.76±1.27 of 6.00), as well as the skepticism in personal protective equipment (3382; 83.55%) and biosafety procedures (3278; 80.98%) used as an efficient form of COVID-19 transmission prevention. Country region, performance of social distancing, dental specialty, the use of personal protective equipment, and biosafety preventive measures influenced the likelihood of dentists to perform dental treatment, either elective or urgent, during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: The need of extra preventive barriers for dental treatment may bring an extra financial stress in the Brazilian public primary and secondary health care system, as well as in the patient-dentist relationship, which may have to be reframed. Internationally accepted public guideline policies regarding dental treatment safety, as well as the technological development of preventive tools, are needed to deal with the challenges brought by COVID-19.","Vieira-Meyer, Anya P G F; Coutinho, Maíra B; Santos, Helena P G; Saintrain, Maria V; Candeiro, George T de M",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,,415

METHODS: We performed a retrospective multicentre cohort study of 9,991 consecutive patients hospitalized in a major New York academic centre between March 7th and June 5th, 2020 with laboratory confirmed COVID-19. The clinical outcomes assessed included risk of hospitalization, in-hospital mortality, risk of intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and need for mechanical ventilation among smokers (current and former). Multivariable logistic regression and propensity score models were built to adjust for potential confounders. FINDINGS: Among 9,991 consecutive patients diagnosed with COVID-19, 2,212 (22.1%) patients were self-reported smokers (406 current and 1806 former). Current smoking was not associated with an increased risk of hospitalization (propensity score [PS]-adjusted OR 0.91; p=0.46), in-hospital mortality (PS-OR 0.77; p=0.12), ICU admission (PS-OR 1.18; p=0.37), or intubation (PS-OR 1.04; p=0.85). Similarly, former smoking was not associated with an increased risk of hospitalization (PS-OR 0.88; p=0.11), in-hospital mortality (PS-OR 1.03; p=0.78), ICU admission (PS-OR 1.03; p=0.95), or intubation (PS-OR 0.93; p=0.57). Furthermore, smoking (current or former) was not associated with an increased risk of hospitalization (PS-OR 0.85; p=0.05), in-hospital mortality (PS-OR 0.94; p=0.49), ICU admission (PS-OR 0.86; p=0.17), or intubation (PS-OR 0.79; p=0.06). INTERPRETATION: Smoking is a well-known risk factor associated with greater susceptibility and subsequent increased severity of respiratory infections. In the current COVID-19 pandemic, smokers may have increased risk and severe pneumonia. In the current COVID-19 pandemic, smokers are believed to have an increased risk of mortality as well as severe pneumonia. However, in our analysis of real-world clinical data, smoking was not associated with increased in-patient mortality in COVID-19 pneumonia, in accordance with prior reports.

421975,Operative team checklist for aerosol generating procedures to minimise exposure of healthcare workers to SARS-CoV-2,2020,"Abstract Recent calls by world leaders recommend that policy responses to the COVID crisis incorporate ?green stimulus? or ?green recovery? as a vital element. In a 2014 article in this journal, we argued that green stimulus would be an inefficient way to either boost demand and restore full employment in the context of the global financial crisis or pursue long-run environmental goals. In this paper, we argue that the attempt to marry green and COVID recovery programs may prove an even less fitting response to the near-term crisis, while still threatening to put environmental policy on paths that prove inefficient in the long run. We argue that green stimulus/recovery, while yielding more long-term climate benefits, would likely generate a slower and smaller recovery in jobs and activity than a traditional macroeconomic stimulus. This creates a trade-off for policymakers. The global financial crisis provides our primary real-world experience of green stimulus/recovery policies. A small but growing number of ex post empirical studies suggest that these measures' near-term growth impact was less than expected or obtained at a relatively high cost. There is also a danger that orienting green programs toward near-term shocks like the global financial crisis and COVID could compromise public understanding of, political support for, and the quality of environmental and climate policies in the long run.

The framework guides decision-makers using a question-and-answer format, in language that avoids philosophical and medical technicality. The working party met five times over the following week and then submitted a draft Framework for consideration by two groups of intensivists and one group of academic ethicists. It was also presented to a panel on a national current affairs programme. The Framework was then revised on the basis of feedback from these sources and made publicly available online on April 3, ten days after the initial meeting. The framework is published here in full to stimulate ongoing discussion about rapid development of user-friendly clinical ethics resources in ongoing and future pandemics.","Dawson, Angus; Isaacs, David; Jansen, Melanie; Jordens, Christopher; Kerridge, Ian; Kihlbom, Ulrik; Kilham, Henry; Preisz, Anne; Sheahan, Linda; Skowronski, George",J. bioeth. inq,,415

423318,Health status of patients with autoimmune liver disease during SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in northern Italy,2020,"BACKGROUND: The opioid crisis in the United States may be exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Increases in opioid use, emergency medical services (EMS) runs for opioid-related overdoses, and opioid overdose deaths have been reported. No study has examined changes in multiple naloxone administrations, an indicator of overdose severity, during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This study examines changes in the occurrence of naloxone administrations and multiple naloxone administrations during EMS runs for opioid-related overdoses during the COVID-19 pandemic in Guilford County, North Carolina (NC). METHODS: Using a period-over-period approach, we compared the occurrence of opioid-related EMS runs, naloxone administrations, and multiple naloxone administrations during the 29-week period before (September 1, 2019, to March 9, 2020) and after NC's COVID-19 state of emergency declaration (ie, the COVID-19 period of March 10 to September 30, 2020). Furthermore, historical data were used to generate a quasi-control distribution of period-over-period changes to compare the occurrence of each outcome during the COVID-19 period to each 29-week period back to January 1, 2014. RESULTS: All outcomes increased during the COVID-19 period. Compared to the previous 29 weeks, the COVID-19 period experienced increases in the weekly mean number of opioid-related EMS runs (25.6, SD 5.6 vs 18.6, SD 6.6; P<.001), naloxone administrations (22.3, SD 6.2 vs 14.1, SD 6.0; P<.001), and multiple naloxone administrations (5.0, SD 1.9 vs 2.7, SD 1.9; P<.001), corresponding to proportional increases of 37.4%, 57.8%, and 84.8%, respectively. Additionally, the increases during the COVID-19 period were greater than 91% of all historical 29-week periods analyzed. CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence of EMS runs for opioid-related overdoses, naloxone administrations, and multiple naloxone administrations during EMS runs increased during the COVID-19 pandemic in Guilford County, NC. For a host of reasons that need to be explored, the COVID-19 pandemic appears to have exacerbated the opioid crisis.","Khoury, Dalia; Preiss, Alexander; Geiger, Paul; Anwar, Mohd; Conway, Kevin Paul",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,415

424842,Chest computed tomography findings in different phases of SARS-CoV-2 infection,2021,"INTRODUCTION: There is an increased risk of thrombotic complications in patients with COVID-19. Hemodialysis patients are already at an increased risk for thromboembolic events such as stroke and pulmonary embolism. The aim of our study was to determine the incidence of late thrombotic complications (deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, stroke, new-onset vascular access thrombosis) in maintenance hemodialysis patients after recovery from COVID-19. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of 200 prevalent hemodialysis patients in our center at the start of the pandemic. We excluded incident patients after the cohort entry date and those who required hemodialysis for acute kidney injury, and excluded patients with less than 1 month follow-up due to kidney transplantation or death from non-thrombotic causes. FINDINGS: One-hundred and eighty five prevalent hemodialysis patients finally met the inclusion criteria; 37 patients (17.6%) had SARS-CoV-2 infection, out of which 10 (27%) died during the acute phase of disease without evidence of thrombotic events. There was an increased risk of thrombotic events in COVID-19 survivors compared to the non-infected cohort (18.5% vs. 1.9%, p = 0.002) after a median follow-up of 7 months. Multivariate regression analysis showed that COVID-19 infection increased risk for late thrombotic events adjusted for age, sex, hypertension, diabetes, antithrombotic treatment, and previous thrombotic events (Odds Ratio (OR) 26.4, 95% confidence interval 2.5-280.6, p = 0.01). Clinical and laboratory markers did not predict thrombotic events. CONCLUSIONS: There is an increased risk of late thrombotic complications in hemodialysis patients after infection with COVID-19.

427896,Intrauterine vertical SARS-CoV-2 infection: a case confirming transplacental transmission followed by divergence of the viral genome,2021,"BACKGROUND: Communities with low vaccination rates are at greater risk during outbreaks of vaccine preventable diseases. Most Australian parents support vaccines, but some refuse and are often judged harshly by their community, especially during an outbreak. We sought the perspectives of Australian public health experts on the key issues faced when managing a measles outbreak in an area with high anti-vaccination sentiment. METHODS: A measles outbreak scenario formed the basis of a 3-round modified Delphi process to identify key practitioner concerns in relation to parents/carers who don't follow the recommended vaccination schedule. We surveyed a range of professionals in the field: policymakers, infectious disease experts, immunisation program staff, and others involved in delivering childhood vaccinations, to identify key priorities when responding to an outbreak in a community with low vaccination coverage. RESULTS: Findings indicate that responses to measles outbreaks in communities with high anti-vaccination sentiment are motivated by concerns about the potential for a much larger outbreak event. The highest operational priority is to isolate infected children. The two most highly ranked practical issues are mistrust from non-vaccinating members of the local region and combatting misinformation about vaccines. Trying to change minds of such individuals is not a priority during an outbreak, nor is vaccinating their children. Using media and social media to provide information about the outbreak and measures the public can take to limit the spread of the disease was a focus. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide a deeper understanding of the challenges faced during an outbreak and priorities for communicating with communities where there is a high level of anti-vaccination sentiment. In the context of a global pandemic, the results of this study also have implications for managing public health responses to community transmission of SARS-CoV-2, as COVID-19 vaccines becomes widely available.","Robinson, Penelope; Wiley, Kerrie; Degeling, Chris",BMC Public Health,,415

Here we use neutron polarization analysis to show that such a strain on BaFe$_2$As$_2$ also induces a static or quasi-static out-of-plane ($c$-axis) AF order and its associated critical spin fluctuations near $T_N/T_s$. Therefore, uniaxial pressure necessary to detwin single crystals of BaFe$_2$As$_2$ actually rotates the easy axis of the collinear AF order near $T_N/T_s$, and such effect due to spin-orbit coupling must be taken into account to unveil the intrinsic electronic/magnetic properties of the system.","Liu, Panpan; Klemm, Mason L.; Tian, Long; Lu, Xingye; Song, Yu; Tam, David W.; Schmalzl, Karin; Park, J.

428217,"Preliminary case report on the SARS-CoV-2 cluster in the UK, France, and Spain",2020,"The UK implemented a lockdown in Spring (2020) to curtail the person-to-person transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Measures restricted movements to one outing per day for exercise and shopping, otherwise most people were restricted to their dwelling except for key workers (e.g. medical, supermarkets, and transport). In this study, we quantified changes to air quality across the United Kingdom from 30/03/2020 to 03/05/2020 (weeks 14-18), the period of most stringent travel restrictions. Daily pollutant measurements of NO2, O3 and PM2.5 from the national network of monitoring sites during this period were compared with measurements over the same period during 2017-19. Comparisons were also made with predicted concentrations for the 2020 period from business-as-usual (BAU) modelling, where the contributions of normal anthropogenic activities were estimated under the observed meteorological conditions. During the lockdown study period there was a 69% reduction in traffic overall (74% reduction in light and 35% in heavy vehicles). Measurements from 129 monitoring stations, identified mean reductions in NO2 of 38.3% (-8.8 µg/m3) and PM2.5 of 16.5% (-2.2 µg/m3). Improvements in NO2 and PM2.5 were largest at urban traffic sites and more modest at background locations where a large proportion of the population live. In contrast, O3 concentrations on average increased by 7.6% (+4.8 µg/m3) with the largest increases at roadside sites due to reductions in local emissions of NO. A lack of VOC monitoring limited our capacity to interpret changes in O3 at urban background locations. BAU models predicted comparable NO2 reductions and O3 gains, although PM2.5 episodes would have been more prominent without lockdown. Results demonstrate the relatively modest contribution of traffic to air quality, suggesting that sustained improvements in air quality require actions across various sectors, including working with international and European initiatives on long-range transport air pollutants, especially PM2.5 and O3.","Jephcote, Calvin; Hansell, Anna L; Adams, Kathryn; Gulliver, John",Environ Pollut,,415

429601,Mid-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on cardiovascular outcomes,2021,"Background: Radiological examinations of COVID-19 positive patients play a vital role in early diagnosis and assessment of disease course, as most COVID-19 infected patients were diagnosed with pneumonia and characteristic CT imaging patterns. Asymptomatic infected individuals, called “asymptomatic carrier or transmitter”, who are the infectious sources of SARS-CoV-2, and some of them progress rapidly, even resulting in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with a high case-fatality rate. Our study is a prospective study and aims to be familiar with the CT imaging features of asymptomatic cases with COVID-19 pneumonia. Results: A total of 44 asymptomatic cases with COVID-19 pneumonia between March 20, 2020 and May 23, 2020 were enrolled. All patients had a history of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 or recent travel history. All patients had no symptoms. The predominant feature of CT findings in this cross-sectional study was ground-glass opacity (GGO) (41, 93%) with peripheral (34, 77.3%) distribution, bilateral location (20, 45.5%) with lower lobe predominance (left lower lobe 72% and right lower lobe 50%). Conclusion: CT imaging of asymptomatic cases with COVID-19 pneumonia has highly characteristics findings. Since asymptomatic patients are the asymptomatic transmitter, and some patients can progress rapidly in the short term, it is essential to early diagnose asymptomatic patients with COVID-19. CT scan has great sensitivity in screening and detecting patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.","Ali, Rasha Mostafa Mohamed; Ghonimy, Mai Bahgat Ibrahim",Egypt. J. Radiol. Nucl. Med.,,415

431585,SARS-CoV-2 Infection during Pregnancy in a Rural Midwest All-delivery Cohort and Associated Maternal and Neonatal Outcomes,2021,"The recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 disease, also known as COVID-19, has emerged as a pandemic. The unavailability of specific therapeutic drugs and vaccines urgently demands sincere efforts for drug discovery against COVID-19. The main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 is a critical drug target as it plays an essential role in virus replication. Therefore for the identification of potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, we applied a structure-based virtual screening approach followed by molecular dynamics (MD) study. A library of 686 phytochemicals was subjected to virtual screening which resulted in 28 phytochemicals based on binding energy. These phytochemicals were further subjected to drug-likeness and toxicity analysis, which resulted in seven drug-like hits. Out of seven, five phytochemicals viz., Mpro-Dehydrtectol (-10.3 kcal/mol), Epsilon-viniferin (-8.6 kcal/mol), Peimisine (-8.6 kcal/mol), Gmelanone (-8.4 kcal/mol), and Isocolumbin (-8.4 kcal/mol) were non-toxic. Consequently, these phytochemicals are subjected to MD, post MD analysis, and MM/PBSA calculations. The results of 100 ns MD simulation, RMSF, SASA, Rg, and MM/PBSA show that Epsilon-viniferin (-29.240 kJ/mol), Mpro-Peimisine (-43.031 kJ/mol) and Gmelanone (-13.093 kJ/mol) form a stable complex with Mpro and could be used as potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. However, further investigation of these inhibitors against Mpro receptor of COVID-19 is needed to validate their candidacy for clinical trials. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

However, it is unclear if these changes are reversible. Methods: We prospectively assessed Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and 18F-FDG PET scans in 8 COVID-19 patients at the subacute (as no longer infectious) and chronic stages (approximately six months after symptom onset). The expression of the previously established COVID-19-related covariance pattern was analyzed at both stages to examine the time course of post-COVID-19 cognitive impairment. For further validation, we also conducted a conventional group analysis. Results: Follow-up 18F-FDG PET revealed a significant reduction of initial frontoparietal and, to a lesser extent, temporal glucose hypometabolism that was accompanied by a significant improvement in cognition. The expression of the previously established COVID-19-related pattern was significantly lower at follow-up and correlated inversely with MoCA performance. However, both 18F-FDG PET and cognitive assessment suggest a residual impairment. Conclusions: Although a significant recovery of regional neuronal function and cognition can be clearly stated, residuals are still measurable in some patients six months after the manifestation of COVID-19. Given the current pandemic situation and tremendous uncertainty concerning the long-term effects of COVID-19, the present study provides novel insights of highest medical and socioeconomic relevance.","Blazhenets, Ganna; Schröter, Nils; Bormann, Tobias; Thurow, Johannes; Wagner, Dirk; Frings, Lars; Weiller, Cornelius; Meyer, Philipp T; Dressing, Andrea; Hosp, Jonas A",J. nucl. med,,415
436210,23 A Bloody Disguise: IgA Nephropathy Relapse After SARS-CoV-2 Infection,2021,"BACKGROUND: Rapid and extensive testing of large parts of the population and specific subgroups is crucial for proper management of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections and decision-making in times of a pandemic outbreak. However, point-of-care (POC) testing in places such as emergency units, outpatient clinics, airport security points or the entrance of any public building is a major challenge. The need for thermal cycling and nucleic acid isolation hampers the use of standard PCR-based methods for this purpose. METHODS: To avoid these obstacles, we tested PCR-independent methods for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from primary material (nasopharyngeal swabs) including reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) and specific high-sensitivity enzymatic reporter unlocking (SHERLOCK). RESULTS: Whilst specificity of standard RT-LAMP assays appears to be satisfactory, sensitivity does not reach the current gold-standard quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays yet. We describe a novel multiplexed RT-LAMP approach and validate its sensitivity on primary samples. This approach allows for fast and reliable identification of infected individuals. Primer optimization and multiplexing helps to increase sensitivity significantly. In addition, we directly compare and combine our novel RT-LAMP assays with SHERLOCK. CONCLUSION: In summary, this approach reveals one-step multiplexed RT-LAMP assays as a prime-option for the development of easy and cheap POC test kits.","Schermer, Bernhard; Fabretti, Francesca; Damagnez, Maximilian; Di Cristanziano, Veronica; Heger, Eva; Arjune, Sita; Tanner, Nathan A; Imhof, Thomas; Koch, Manuel; Ladha, Alim; Joung, Julia; Gootenberg, Jonathan S; Abudayyeh, Omar O; Burst, Volker; Zhang, Feng; Klein, Florian; Benzing, Thomas; Müller, Roman-Ulrich",PLoS One,,415

Such knowledge is lacking especially in the general population. Here, we studied changes in Immunoglobulin (Ig) isotype seropositivity and IgG binding strength of SARS-CoV-2-specific serum antibodies up to 7 months following onset of symptoms in a nationwide sample. METHODS: Participants from a prospective representative serological study in the Netherlands were included based on IgG seroconversion to the Spike S1 protein of SARS-CoV-2 (N=353), with up to three consecutive serum samples per seroconverted participant (N=738). IgM, IgA and IgG antibody concentrations to S1, and increase in IgG avidity in relation to time since onset of disease symptoms, were determined. RESULTS: While SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM and IgA antibodies declined rapidly after the first month post onset of disease, specific IgG was still present in 92% (95% confidence interval, CI, 89-95) of the participants after 7 months. The estimated 2-fold decrease of IgG antibodies was 158 days (95% CI 136-189). Concentrations sustained better in persons reporting significant symptoms compared to asymptomatic persons or those with mild upper respiratory complaints only. Similarly, avidity of IgG antibodies for symptomatic persons showed a steeper increase over time compared with persons with mild or no symptoms (p=0.022). CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies persist and show increasing avidity over time, indicative of underlying immune maturation. These data support development of immune memory against SARS-CoV-2 providing insight into protection of the general unvaccinated part of the population.","den Hartog, Gerco; Vos, Eric R A; van den Hoogen, Lotus L; van Boven, Michiel; Schepp, Rutger M; Smits, Gaby; van Vliet, Jeffrey; Woudstra, Linde; Wijmenga-Monsuur, Alienke J; van Hagen, Cheyenne C E; Sanders, Elisabeth A M; de Melker, Hester E; van der Klis, Fiona R M; van Binnendijk, Robert S",Clin. infect. dis,,415

Healthcare workers must utilize appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) and infection control prevention techniques given the high risk of transmission and potential morbidity associated with COVID-19. We present a case report highlighting the strengths and potential applications of telemedicine technology in a patient's evaluation during an ongoing emerging, novel infectious disease. CASE REPORT A 67-year-old male presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with complaints of fever. His presentation coincided with a recent declaration of a pandemic caused by COVID-19 and a known exposure. Telemedicine evaluation was performed using InTouch Provider® software (InTouch Health, Goleta, CA, USA). The treating clinician was able to interact with the patient entirely through observations via web camera. COVID-19 nasopharyngeal swab polymerase chain reaction testing was ordered and was performed by a dedicated triage nurse. The patient was deemed stable for discharge given his normal vital signs and well appearance. Approximately 72 hours after discharge from the ED, the patient was contacted with positive COVID-19 swab results. CONCLUSIONS We present the first known case report highlighting use of telemedicine to diagnosis COVID-19 in a patient present in the ED. With the appropriate systems in place, this method of evaluating the patient helped to limit clinician exposure, decrease risk of transmission to key personnel, and assisted with preserving PPE supplies.

We first focus on zoonotic disease spillover and the rate at which primary human cases appear, demonstrating that a potential outbreak is directly related to the area of wildlife habitat. We then develop a model of the costs and benefits of land conversion that includes the effect of habitat size on the risk of disease outbreak. Our model and numerical simulations show that incorporating this risk requires more wildlife habitat conservation in the long run, and how much more should be conserved will depend on the initial habitat size. If the area is too small, then no conversion should take place. Any policy to control habitat loss, such as a tax imposed on the rents from converted land, should also vary with habitat area.","Barbier, Edward B",J Environ Econ Manage,,415

445764,Association of Age With Likelihood of Developing Symptoms and Critical Disease Among Close Contacts Exposed to Patients With Confirmed SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Italy,2021,"BACKGROUND: Compared to individuals without type 2 diabetes mellitus, the relative increase in cardiovascular mortality is much higher in women than in men in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus. METHODS: We evaluated data from 7443 individuals (3792 women, 50.9%), aged 20 to 81 years, from two independent population-based investigations, SHIP-0 and MONICA/KORA S3. We analyzed the longitudinal sex-specific associations of lipoprotein(a) with cardiovascular mortality in individuals with and without type 2 diabetes mellitus using Cox regression. RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 20.5 years (136,802 person-years), 657 participants (404 men and 253 women) died of cardiovascular causes. Among individuals without type 2 diabetes mellitus, men had a significantly higher risk for cardiovascular mortality compared to women in unadjusted model and after adjustment. On the other hand, in participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the risk for cardiovascular mortality was not different between men and women in the unadjusted model and after adjustment for age, body mass index, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, fasting status and study sample (SHIP-0, MONICA/KORA S3). Further adjustment for lipoprotein(a) concentrations had no impact on the hazard ratio (HR) for cardiovascular mortality comparing men versus women in individuals without type 2 diabetes mellitus [HR: 1.94; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.63 to 2.32; p < 0.001]. In individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus, however, further adjustment for lipoprotein(a) led to an increased risk for cardiovascular mortality in men and a decreased risk in women resulting in a statistically significant difference between men and women (HR: 1.53; 95% CI 1.04 to 2.24; p = 0.029). CONCLUSIONS: Women are described to have a stronger relative increase in cardiovascular mortality than men when comparing individuals with and without type 2 diabetes mellitus. Higher lipoprotein(a) concentrations in women with type 2 diabetes mellitus than in men with type 2 diabetes mellitus might partially explain this finding.","Markus, Marcello Ricardo Paulista; Ittermann, Till; Schipf, Sabine; Bahls, Martin; Nauck, Matthias; Völzke, Henry; Santos, Raul Dias; Peters, Annette; Zeller, Tanja; Felix, Stephan Burkhard; Vasan, Ramachandran S; Thorand, Barbara; Steinhagen-Thiessen, Elisabeth; Dörr, Marcus",Cardiovasc Diabetol,,415

446053,"Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among healthy blood donors in Karachi, Pakistan",2020,"BACKGROUND: The Covid-19 pandemic is pushing health care systems to their limits. Dramatic reductions in the adult elective surgery are ubiquitous but corresponding changes in pediatric services are not well described. The Swedish Perioperative Registry (SPOR) contains data on all anesthetic procedures in Sweden, and therefore provides a unique opportunity to analyze the effect of the pandemic on the pediatric anesthesia capacity on a national level. We hypothesized that there would be a significant reduction in pediatric elective procedures. The aim was to determine the effects on pediatric surgical and anesthetic services during the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in Sweden. METHODS: For this retrospective registry cohort study, we extracted all procedures performed on patients < 18 years of age in 2020 and 2019. Week 12 to 26 of 2020 was defined as the first wave and data was analyzed according to level of care, type of surgery, procedure code and emergency or elective surgery. RESULTS: We found 7015 fewer procedures during the first wave epoch. Elective cases were reduced by 53.7% (p<0.001); emergency surgery was not significantly affected. During the peak of the first wave in April, there was a 72.8% reduction in elective cases; ENT/maxillofacial surgery showed the greatest reduction (86.7%). The surgical and anesthesia capacity recovered to near normal levels by the end of June 2020. CONCLUSION: We conclude that the impact of Covid-19 on pediatric surgical procedures in Sweden during the first wave of the pandemic was dramatic but elective services were restored a few months after the peak.","Melander, Sixten; Almström, Jimmy; Enlund, Gunnar; Frykholm, Peter",Paediatr. anaesth,,415

METHODS: We performed a review of the literature pertaining to cancer, financial toxicity, and economic challenges. RESULTS: Multiple societies have put forth recommendations to modify delivery of cancer care in order to minimize patient exposure to the virus. Cancer survivors, especially patients with head and neck cancer, have been disproportionately affected by rising unemployment levels and economic recessions in the past, both of which are linked to higher cancer mortality. Patients who rely on employer-provided insurance and do not qualify for Medicaid may lose access to life-saving treatments. CONCLUSIONS: It is essential to implement interventions and policy changes in order to mitigate the effects of this pandemic but also to ensure this becomes a nonissue during the next one.","Baddour, Khalil; Kudrick, Lauren D; Neopaney, Aakriti; Sabik, Lindsay M; Peddada, Shyamal D; Nilsen, Marci L; Johnson, Jonas T; Ferris, Robert L; Mady, Leila J",Head Neck,,415

Here, we report on the treatment of eight severe COVID-19 pneumonia patients-seven hospitalized in intensive care units (ICUs) in Greece and one non-ICU patient in the Netherlands-with the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist Anakinra. All patients scored positive for the hemophagocytosis score (HScore) and were diagnosed with secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistocytosis (sHLH) characterized by pancytopenia, hyper-coagulation, acute kidney injury, and hepatobiliary dysfunction. At the end of treatment, ICU patients had less need for vasopressors, significantly improved respiratory function, and lower HScore. Although three patients died, the mortality was lower than historical series of patients with sHLH in sepsis. These data suggest that administration of Anakinra may be beneficial for treating severe COVID-19 patients with sHLH as determined by the HScore, and they support the need for larger clinical studies to validate this concept.","Dimopoulos, George; de Mast, Quirijn; Markou, Nikolaos; Theodorakopoulou, Maria; Komnos, Apostolos; Mouktaroudi, Maria; Netea, Mihai G; Spyridopoulos, Themistoklis; Verheggen, Rebecca J; Hoogerwerf, Jacobien; Lachana, Alexandra; van de Veerdonk, Frank L; Giamarellos-Bourboulis, Evangelos J",,,415

METHODS: From March 29th to April 15th of 2020, a total of 240 patients with respiratory distress underwent both a low-dose chest CT scan and RT-PCR tests. The performance of chest CT in diagnosing COVID-19 was assessed with reference to the RT-PCR result. Two board-certified radiologists (mean 24 years of experience chest CT), blinded for the RT-PCR result, reviewed all scans and decided positive or negative chest CT findings by consensus. RESULTS: Out of 240 patients, 60% (144/240) had positive RT-PCR results and 89% (213/240) had a positive chest CT scans. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of chest CT in suggesting COVID-19 were 100% (95% CI: 97-100%, 144/240), 28% (95% CI: 19-38%, 27/240), 68% (95% CI: 65-70%) and 100%, respectively. The diagnostic accuracy of the chest CT suggesting COVID-19 was 71% (95% CI: 65-77%). Thirty-three patients with positive chest CT scan and negative RT-PCR test at baseline underwent repeat RT-PCR assay. In this subgroup, 21.2% (7/33) cases became RT-PCR positive. CONCLUSION: Chest CT imaging has high sensitivity and high NPV for diagnosing COVID-19 and can be considered as an alternative primary screening tool for COVID-19 in epidemic areas. In addition, a negative RT-PCR test, but positive CT findings can still be suggestive of COVID-19 infection.","Bollineni, Vikram Rao; Nieboer, Koenraad Hans; Döring, Seema; Buls, Nico; de Mey, Johan",Insights Imaging,,415

The patient and clinician experience of video outpatient consultation during the peak of the pandemic was studied for acceptability and to gather recommendations to improve the service during continuing infection control measures. Methods Outpatient video telemedicine was introduced over a 14-day period including the provision of equipment, systems integration and stakeholder communication. Patient and clinician experience were measured between 15 April 2020 and 5 May 2020. Results A total of 43 patients and 79 clinicians provided feedback. Of the patients, 86% were above the age of 30 years, with the largest patient group aged 51-70 years. Patient experience was positive. All (100%) patients found joining the video consultation easy; 93% of them recommended to use it for future consultations. Clinician satisfaction was >90% with sound and video quality. Patients were less satisfied than clinicians in that they had communicated everything they wanted to (86% versus 95%). All (100%) patients thought that the video telemedicine solution met their needs, but 25% of clinicians believed that the patient experience of a video consultation was worse than a face-to-face clinic appointment. The three significant factors identified for introducing video consultations were successful IT, improved patient experience and digital healthcare records. Conclusions In the COVID-19 crisis, video telemedicine played a central role in outpatient consultations with excellent levels of success. With some differences in satisfaction level, clinicians significantly underestimate the level of patient satisfaction with outpatient video consultation.","Dhahri, Adeel Abbas; Iqbal, Muhammad Rafaih; Pardoe, Helen",Cureus,,415

Sensitivity analysis, subgroup analysis, and meta-regression analysis were used to deal with the heterogeneity among studies. Forty-one studies with 219,543 subjects and 115,635 COVID-19 patients were included. Subjects with obesity were more likely to have positive SARS-CoV-2 test results (OR = 1.50; 95% CI: 1.37-1.63, I2 = 69.2%); COVID-19 patients with obesity had a higher incidence of hospitalization (OR = 1.54, 95% CI: 1.33-1.78, I2 = 60.9%); hospitalized COVID-19 patients with obesity had a higher incidence of intensive care unit admission (OR = 1.48, 95% CI: 1.24-1.77, I2 = 67.5%), invasive mechanical ventilation (OR = 1.47, 95% CI: 1.31-1.65, I2 = 18.8%), and in-hospital mortality (OR = 1.14, 95% CI: 1.04-1.26, I2 = 74.4%). A higher degree of obesity also indicated a higher risk of almost all of the above events. The region may be one of the causes of heterogeneity.

454685,SARS-CoV-2 infection among asymptomatic healthcare workers of the emergency department in a tertiary care facility,2020,"OBJECTIVES: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the French government has decided a general lockdown This unprecedented situation has raised concerns about children's and adolescent's mental health Children and adolescents diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) may find this context of restrained activity particularly tricky The objectives of our study are to gather information about the well-being and global life conditions of children and adolescents with ADHD during the COVID-19 outbreak in France METHODS: We designed a survey including both open-ended questions and questionnaire items for parents of children and adolescents with ADHD Parents responded to the following open-ended questions: 1) ""How is your child doing since the lockdown?"" 2) ""How is life at home since the lockdown?"" 3) ""If you had a remote service provision with a mental health professional (e g by telephone or video technology), please share your thoughts and any suggestions with us"" 4) ""Please share any other items that you think are important about ADHD symptoms of your child and the lockdown situation"" This survey was posted on social media on the 6th of April and disseminated by French ADHD-parent and patient organizations The present article reports the descriptive, qualitative and textometrical analyses of the survey RESULTS: Between day 20 and 30 of lockdown, 538 parents responded to the survey, and we included 533 responses in the final analysis The vast majority of responders were women 95 % (95 % CI 93,50;97,18) with children whose mean age was 10,5 (95 % CI 7 58;13 44) Since the lockdown, 34 71 % (95 % CI 30 70;38 94) of children experienced a worsening in well-being, 34 33 % (95 % CI 30 34;38 56) showed no significant changes and 30 96 % (95 % CI 27 09;35 10) were doing better according to their parents The thematic analysis showed that an improvement of their children's anxiety was one of the main topics addressed by parents This improvement related to less school-related strain and flexible schedules that respected their children's rhythm Improved self-esteem was another topic that parents linked with a lesser exposure of their children to negative feed-back Parents repeatedly reported both inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity However, optimal lockdown life conditions seemed to compensate for the impact of ADHD symptoms (e g sufficient space at home, presence of a garden) Some parents reported worsening of general well-being in their children, and this manifested as oppositional/defiant attitudes and emotional outbursts Parents also cited sleep problems and anxiety in this context As regards everyday life during lock-down, at-home schooling was another major topic-parents described that their children struggled to complete school-related tasks and that teachers seemed to have forgotten about academic accommodations The lockdown situation seems to have raised parents' awareness of the role of inattention and ADHD symptoms in their children's learning difficulties Due to potential selection biases, the results of our survey may not be generalizable to all children and adolescents with ADHD The main strengths of this rapid survey-based study lies in the reactivity of the participants and the quality and diversity of their responses to the open-ended questions CONCLUSIONS: According to their parents, most children and adolescents with ADHD experience stability or improvement of their well-being An improvement in school-related anxiety and the flexible adjustment to the children's' rhythms as well as parents' increased awareness of the difficulties their children experience are among the key topics in parents' descriptions Publisher: Abstract available from the publisher fre","Bobo, E.; Lin, L.; Acquaviva, E.; Caci, H.; Franc, N.; Gamon, L.; Picot, M.

METHODS: Our institution hosted 25 students for 4-week VSI rotations. We held two sessions, one in July 2020 and another in August 2020. The students participated in a curriculum centered around Zoom® and phone interactions with residents and faculty. The curriculum included selected readings, surgical videos, group didactics and 1-on-1 mentorship. Anonymous pre-rotation and post-rotation self-assessments were used to ascertain achievement of learning objectives and utility of educational tools implemented during the rotation. Faculty and resident mentors were also surveyed to assess their experience. RESULTS: With the exception of knot tying techniques (p=0.67), students reported significant improvement in their understanding vascular surgery concepts after the virtual elective (p < 0.05). The highest ranked components of the course were interpersonal including interaction with faculty, mentorship, and learning the program culture. The lowest ranked components of the course were simulation training and research opportunities. Rating of utility for aspects of the course were consistent with ranking of components, with faculty interaction having the highest average rating. The ideal number of hours for daily virtual interaction reported by students ranged from 3 to 6 with a median of 4. Overall, the majority of mentors were satisfied with virtual course. However, they did report limited ability to assess student personality and fit for the program. The number of hours per week spent by mentors on the virtual vascular surgery rotation ranged from 2 to 7 with a median of 4. Fourteen out of seventeen mentors reported that having a virtual student was significant addition to their existing workload. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our student and mentor feedback were positive. Several challenges inherent to the virtual environment still need to be refined, however the goals of a VSI are distinct and should be explored by training programs. With changes to healthcare in the United States in the horizon and the arrival of SARS-CoV2 pandemic constraints, implementing a virtual away rotation may be an acceptable platform for adapting our recruitment strategies.","Patel, Shivik; Chawla, Amit; Unruh, Marie; Guidry, London; Brooke, Amadis; Lalani, Alykhan; Kim, Joyce; Risher, William; Zea, Nicholas; Torrance, Bruce; Palit, Tapash; Gwin, Taylor; Danos, Denise M; McArthur Sheahan, Claudie; Sheahan, Malachi Gerard",J. vasc. surg,,415

People in many countries, all over the world, are locked down to their houses, and policies are implemented to avoid the spread of corona virus. But looking at this scenario, in other perspective reveals dif-ferent knowledge. As, the roads are not crowded, and the malls, transport, institutes, and industries are closed, there is significant improvement in the climate. The present study intends to review these positive changes in climate, and the lessons human should learn from the pandemic, COVID-19. The data related to the effect of human interactions on nature, and the results of lock-down was collected from international newspapers, scholarly articles from peer reviewed journals, and WHO database. The data showed that, after lock-down, there is improvement in the quality of air, the green house gas emission has significantly reduced, and amount of industrial wastes poured in rivers has dropped down, making the water clearer. The nature heals itself, with less human interactions, and worsens with more. So, we must make policies not to damage it further, with our interactions.","Borage, Swapnil; Shelotkar, Priyanka",Int.

Could high-dose human immunoglobulin for intravenous use (IVIG) be beneficial?,2020,"We examine the effectiveness of sub-national actions to control a novel disease, such as COVID-19, in the absence of national policy. Evidence shows that countries where sub-national governments have undertaken unilateral social distancing measures to combat the pandemic with little or no coordination have performed less well in controlling the spread of the disease. We explore analytically whether agreement on a common social distancing policy among sub-national governments, i.e., states or provinces, can lead to a better outcome than if each state or province pursues its own social distancing policy in isolation. A key feature of our model is that it accounts for the inter-jurisdictional spillover effects of each sub-national jurisdiction’s policy choice with respect to social distancing. Our results show that, in the absence of a national mandatory agreement, a sub-national agreement with sufficient coordination of social distancing policy among states yields a more effective and efficient control of a pandemic compared to states choosing policy unilaterally. These findings strongly support calls for greater cooperation among and assistance for sub-national governments to improve the effectiveness of their social distancing efforts in controlling the pandemic.","Iverson, Terrence Barbier Edward",Economies,,415

Uncertainty about a patient's COVID-19 status risks infecting healthcare workers and non-COVID-19 inpatients. We evaluated the use of quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) screening for COVID-19 on admission for all patients with fractures. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients older than 18 years admitted with low-energy fractures who were tested by RT-qPCR for SARS-CoV-2 at any time during hospitalization. Two periods based on the applied testing protocol were defined. During the first period, patients were only tested because of epidemiological criteria or clinical suspicion based on fever, respiratory symptoms, or radiological findings. In the second period, all patients admitted for fracture treatment were screened by RT-qPCR. RESULTS: We identified 15 patients in the first period and 42 in the second. In total, 9 (15.8%) patients without clinical or radiological findings tested positive at any moment. Five (33.3%) patients tested positive postoperatively in the first period and three (7.1%) in the second period (p=0.02).For clinically unsuspected patients, postoperative positive detection went from 3/15 (20%) during the first period to 2/42 (4.8%) in the second (p=0.11). Clinical symptoms demonstrated high specificity (92.1%) but poor sensitivity (52.6%) for infection detection. CONCLUSIONS: Symptom-based screening for COVID-19 has shown to be specific but not sensitive. Negative clinical symptoms do not rule out infection. Protocols and separated areas are necessary to treat infected patients. RT-qPCR testing on admission helps minimize the risk of nosocomial and occupational infection.

459662,The wide spectrum of Kawasaki-like disease associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection,2020,"Despite many recent efforts to predict and control emerging infectious disease threats to humans, we failed to anticipate the zoonotic viruses which led to pandemics in 2009 and 2020. The morbidity, mortality, and economic costs of these pandemics have been staggering. We desperately need a more targeted, cost-efficient, and sustainable strategy to detect and mitigate future zoonotic respiratory virus threats. Evidence suggests that the transition from an animal virus to a human pathogen is incremental and requires a considerable number of spillover events and considerable time before a pandemic variant emerges. This evolutionary view argues for the refocusing of public health resources on novel respiratory virus surveillance at human-animal interfaces in geographical hotspots for emerging infectious diseases. Where human-animal interface surveillance is not possible, a secondary high-yield, cost-efficient strategy is to conduct novel respiratory virus surveillance among pneumonia patients in these same hotspots. When novel pathogens are discovered, they must be quickly assessed for their human risk and, if indicated, mitigation strategies initiated. In this review, we discuss the most common respiratory virus threats, current efforts at early emerging pathogen detection, and propose and defend new molecular pathogen discovery strategies with the goal of preempting future pandemics.","Gray, Gregory C; Robie, Emily R; Studstill, Caleb J; Nunn, Charles L",Viruses,,415

463319,Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to premature twins from an asymptomatic mother,2020,"Although millions of patients have clinically recovered from COVID-19, little is known about the immune status of lymphocytes in these individuals. In this study, the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of a clinically recovered (CR) cohort were comparatively analyzed with those of an age- and sex-matched healthy donor (HD) cohort. We found that CD8+ T cells in the CR cohort had higher numbers of effector T cells and effector memory T cells but lower Tc1 (IFN-Î³+), Tc2 (IL-4+), and Tc17 (IL-17A+) cell frequencies. The CD4+ T cells of the CR cohort were decreased in frequency, especially the central memory T cell subset. Moreover, CD4+ T cells in the CR cohort showed lower PD-1 expression and had lower frequencies of Th1 (IFN-Î³+), Th2 (IL-4+), Th17 (IL-17A+), and circulating follicular helper T (CXCR5+PD-1+) cells. Accordingly, the proportion of isotype-switched memory B cells (IgM-CD20hi) among B cells in the CR cohort showed a significantly lower proportion, although the level of the activation marker CD71 was elevated. For CD3-HLA-DR- lymphocytes in the CR cohort, in addition to lower levels of IFN-Î³, granzyme B, and T-bet, the correlation between T-bet and IFN-Î³ was not observed. Additionally, by taking into account the number of days after discharge, all the phenotypes associated with reduced function did not show a tendency toward recovery within 4â11 weeks. The remarkable phenotypic alterations in lymphocytes in the CR cohort suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection profoundly affects lymphocytes and potentially results in dysfunction even after clinical recovery.","Yang, Jingyi; Zhong, Maohua; Zhang, Ejuan; Hong, Ke; Yang, Qingyu; Zhou, Dihan; Xia, Jianbo; Chen, Yao-Qing; Sun, Mingbo; Zhao, Bali; Xiang, Jie; Liu, Ying; Han, Yang; Xu, Mengxin; Zhou, Xi; Huang, Chaolin; Shang, You; Yan, Huimin",J. mol. cell biol.

464767,Reports of three long-term lung disease following SARS-CoV-2 infection,2021,"Countries around the world introduced strict restrictions on movement and activities known as 'lockdowns' to restrict the spread of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) from the end of 2019. A sudden improvement in air quality was observed globally as a result of these lockdowns. To provide insight into the changes in air pollution levels in response to the COVID-19 restrictions we have compared surface air quality data in Delhi during four phases of lockdown and the first phase of the restriction easing period (25 March to 30 June 2020) with data from a baseline period (2018-2019). Simultaneously, short-term exposure of PM2.5 and O3 attributed premature mortality were calculated to understand the health benefit of the change in air quality. Ground-level observations in Delhi showed that concentrations of PM10, PM2.5 and NO2 dropped substantially in 2020 during the overall study period compared with the same period in previous years, with average reductions of ~49%, ~39%, and ~39%, respectively. An overall lower reduction in O3 of ~19% was observed for Delhi. A slight increase in O3 was found in Delhi's industrial and traffic regions. The highest peak of the diurnal variation decreased substantially for all the pollutants at every phase. The decrease in PM2.5 and O3 concentrations in 2020, prevented 904 total premature deaths, a 60% improvement when compared to the figures for 2018-2019. The restrictions on human activities during the lockdown have reduced anthropogenic emissions and subsequently improved air quality and human health in one of the most polluted cities in the world.Implications: I am submitting herewith the manuscript entitled ""Unprecedented Reduction in Air Pollution and Corresponding Short-term Premature Mortality Associated with COVID-19 Forced Confinement in Delhi, India"" for potential publishing in your journal.The novelty of this research lies in: (1) we utilized ground-level air quality data in Delhi during four phases of lockdown and the first phase of unlocking period (25th March to 30th June) for 2020 as well as data from the baseline period (2018-2019) to provide an early insight into the changes in air pollution levels in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, (2) Chatarize the change of diurnal variation of the pollutants and (3) we assess the health risk due to PM2.5 and O3. Results from ground-level observations in Delhi showed that concentrations of PM10, PM2.5 and NO2 substantially dropped in 2020 during the overall study period compared to the similar period in previous years, with an average reduction of ~49%, ~39%, and ~39%, respectively. In the case of O3, the overall reduction was observed as ~19% in Delhi, while a slight increase was found in industrial and traffic regions. And consequently, the highest peak of the diurnal variation decreased substantially for all the pollutants. The health impact assessment of the changes in air quality indicated that 904 short-term premature deaths (~60%) were prevented due to the decline in PM2.5 and O3 concentrations in the study period. The restrictions on human activities during the lockdown have reduced the anthropogenic emissions and subsequently improved air quality and human health in one of the most polluted cities in the world.","Maji, Kamal Jyoti; Namdeo, Anil; Bell, Margaret; Goodman, Paul; Nagendra, S M Shiva; Barnes, Joanna H; De Vito, Laura; Hayes, Enda; Longhurst, James W; Kumar, Rakesh; Sharma, Niraj; Kuppili, Sudheer Kumar; Alshetty, Dheeraj",J Air Waste Manag Assoc,,415

466206,"SARS-CoV-2 infection and acute ischemic stroke in Lombardy, Italy",2021,"BACKGROUND: In March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a public health emergency of international concern. A small proportion of patients infected with COVID-19 go on to develop pneumonia. We speculated that COVID-19 may be likely to result in psychological disorders such as anxiety and depression. In this study, we conducted an investigation of anxiety and depression in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Sixty-five COVID-19 patients were randomly enrolled into this study. Anxiety and depression among participants were measured through the completion of anonymous Chinese-language Zung self-rating anxiety scale and self-rating depression scale questionnaires. Data were analyzed using independent samples t-tests, Mann-Whitney U-tests, and &#967;2 tests. RESULTS: The questionnaire results showed that 26.15% and 41.54% of participants suffered from anxiety and depression, respectively, although there was no significantly statistical difference between the proportions of COVID-19 patients with anxiety and depression. Statistically significant differences in employment status, partial pressure of oxygen, and corticosteroid application existed between moderate- and severe COVID-19 patients (P<0.05). In particular, the partial pressure of oxygen was significantly lower in severe COVID-19 patients than in their moderate counter parts (71.31±23.54 vs. 101.06±34.43, U=156, P=0.006). Total lymphocytes was lower in severe group than in moderate group [1.659±0.643 vs. 0.745 (0.645, 0.928), U=109, P=0.000]. Also, a higher proportion of female than male patients had anxiety (&#967;2=5.388, P=0.02). COVID-19 patients who received antiviral medications also displayed a higher rate of anxiety (&#967;2=4.481, P=0.034). Total lymphocytes between the non-anxiety and anxiety had statistical difference (U=321, P=0.019). Meanwhile, total lymphocytes between the non-depression and depression also had statistical difference (U=389.5, P=0.01).

466207,"SARS-CoV-2 infection and acute ischemic stroke in Lombardy, Italy",2021,"Based on an ad hoc online survey about risk perception and preventive behaviours, we describe three chronological phases related to how people in Germany perceived the Corona pandemic between March 22 and May 10, 2020 In general, participants reported to be less concerned about their own risk than about the risk faced by others However, a good portion of those who thought that they themselves were low risk actually wrote about their belief that they nevertheless had a responsibility to behave in ways that benefited others, even if it came at a cost to themselves In loose reference to Immanuel Kant’s notion that humans have a rational duty to act in a socially responsible manner, we interpret people’s comments about other-regarding behaviour as an initiation of a Kantian tendency during the Corona pandemic Based on these findings, we suggest that policy makers may do better in times of crisis than nudging, incentivizing, or compelling the public by law They can perhaps accomplish more by (also) nurturing people’s innate sense of the need for socially responsible action to be taken in order to meet the daunting challenges of present and future crises © 2020, The Author(s)","Feufel, M.

467501,Evaluating interactions between hyperglycemia and clotting factors in patients suffering with SARS-CoV-2 infection,2021,"Importance: The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic illustrates the increasingly important role of telemedicine as a method of clinician-patient interaction. However, electronic applications (apps) for the testing of ophthalmology vital signs, such as visual acuity, can be published and used without any verification of accuracy, validity, or reliability. Objective: To reassess the accuracy of visual acuity-testing apps and assess their viability for telehealth. Design, Setting, and Participants: The US Apple App Store was queried for apps for visual acuity testing. Anticipated optotype size for various visual acuity lines were calculated and compared against the actual measured optotype size on 4 different Apple hardware devices. No human participants were part of this study. Main Outcomes and Measures: Mean (SD) errors were calculated per device and across multiple devices. Results: On iPhones, 10 apps met inclusion criteria, with mean errors ranging from 0.2% to 109.9%. On the iPads, 9 apps met inclusion criteria, with mean errors ranging from 0.2% to 398.1%. Six apps met criteria and worked on both iPhone and iPad, with mean errors from 0.2% to 249.5%. Of the 6 apps that worked across devices, the top 3 most accurate apps were Visual Acuity Charts (mean [SD] error, 0.2% [0.0%]), Kay iSight Test Professional (mean [SD] error, 3.5% [0.7%]), and Smart Optometry (mean [SD] error, 15.9% [4.3%]). None of the apps tested were ideal for telemedicine, because some apps displayed accurate optotype size, while others displayed the same letters on separate devices; no apps exhibited both characteristics. Conclusions and Relevance: Both Visual Acuity Charts and Kay iSight Test Professional had low mean (SD) errors and functionality across all tested devices, but no apps were suitable for telemedicine. This suggests that new and/or improved visual acuity-testing apps are necessary for optimal telemedicine use.","Steren, Benjamin J; Young, Benjamin; Chow, Jessica",JAMA ophthalmol. (Online),,415

468227,Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in blood donors from the Lodi Red Zone and adjacent Lodi metropolitan and suburban area,2021,"As of 2016, Medicaid accounted for nearly 20% of state general fund budgets. Optional Medicaid services like podiatry are often subject to cost-cutting measures in periods of economic downturn, as was the case in the wake of the 2007 financial crisis. Although the cuts were intended as a cost-saving measure, research indicates they had the opposite effect. The restriction and limitation of these services during the Great Recession resulted in both poorer health outcomes for beneficiaries, and poorer financial outcomes for state Medicaid programs. With states citing record levels of unemployment as of April 2020 and projecting significant declines in annual revenue in 2021, the economic conditions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic are likely to rival those of the Great Recession. Given the historical precedent for restricting or eliminating optional Medicaid services as a cost-saving measure, it is likely that podiatric services will once again come under scrutiny. Previous efforts by state-level podiatric societies have proven successful in lobbying for the reinstatement of coverage under Medicaid by conveying evidence of the negative outcomes associated with elimination to stakeholders. The specialty must once again engage policymakers by drawing on evidence gleaned and lessons learned from past cuts of optional Medicaid services to avert counterproductive coverage restrictions intended to mitigate the financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Brewer, Thomas W; Lanese, Bethany G; Appel, Chad L; Cairns, James S; Armstrong, David G",J.

METHODS: A systematic search of PubMed, up to 31 January 2021, identified publications reporting the case-fatality rate (CFR) among adult patients with solid or hematological malignancies and SARS-CoV-2 infection. The CFR, defined as the rate of death in this population, was assessed with a random effect model; 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. RESULTS: Among 135 selected studies (N = 33,879 patients), the CFR was 25.4% (95% CI 22.9%-28.2%). At a sensitivity analysis including studies with at least 100 patients, the CFR was 21.9% (95% CI 19.1%-25.1%). Among COVID-19 patients with lung (N = 1,135) and breast (N = 1,296) cancers, CFR were 32.4% (95% CI 26.5%-39.6%) and 14.2% (95% CI 9.3%-21.8%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with solid or hematological malignancies and SARS-CoV-2 infection have a high probability of mortality, with comparatively higher and lower CFRs in patients with lung and breast cancers, respectively.","Tagliamento, Marco; Agostinetto, Elisa; Bruzzone, Marco; Ceppi, Marcello; Saini, Kamal S; de Azambuja, Evandro; Punie, Kevin; Westphalen, C Benedikt; Morgan, Gilberto; Pronzato, Paolo; Del Mastro, Lucia; Poggio, Francesca; Lambertini, Matteo",Crit Rev Oncol Hematol,,415

Diuron (N-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-N',N'-dimethylurea) is a chlorinated herbicide widely used in sugarcane plantations. Here, we evaluated the ability of 13 basidiomycete strains of growing in a contaminated culture medium and degrading the xenobiotic. Dissipation rates in culture medium with initial 25 mg/L of diuron ranged from 7.3 to 96.8%, being Pluteus cubensis SXS 320 the most efficient strain, leaving no detectable residues after diuron metabolism. Pycnoporus sanguineus MCA 16 removed 56% of diuron after 40 days of cultivation, producing three metabolites more polar than parental herbicide, two of them identified as being DCPU and DCPMU. Despite of the strong inductive effect of diuron upon laccase synthesis and secretion, the application of crude enzymatic extracts of P. sanguineus did not catalyzed the breakdown of the herbicide in vitro, indicating that diuron biodegradation was not related to this oxidative enzyme.","Henn, Caroline; Arakaki, Ricardo M; Monteiro, Diego Alves; Boscolo, Mauricio; da Silva, Roberto; Gomes, Eleni",Biomed Res Int,,415

472562,Clinical and epidemiological characteristics of children with SARS-CoV-2 infection: a case series in Sinaloa,2021,"COVID-19 sepsis is characterized by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) as a consequence of pulmonary tropism of the virus and endothelial heterogeneity of the host. ARDS is a phenotype among patients with multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS) due to disseminated vascular microthrombotic disease (VMTD). In response to the viral septicemia, the host activates the complement system which produces terminal complement complex C5b-9 to neutralize pathogen. C5b-9 causes pore formation on the membrane of host endothelial cells (ECs) if CD59 is underexpressed. Also, viral S protein attraction to endothelial ACE2 receptor damages ECs. Both affect ECs and provoke endotheliopathy. Disseminated endotheliopathy activates two molecular pathways: inflammatory and microthrombotic. The former releases inflammatory cytokines from ECs, which lead to inflammation. The latter initiates endothelial exocytosis of unusually large von Willebrand factor (ULVWF) multimers and FVIII from Weibel-Palade bodies. If ADAMTS13 is insufficient, ULVWF multimers activate intravascular hemostasis of ULVWF path. In activated ULVWF path, ULVWF multimers anchored to damaged endothelial cells recruit circulating platelets and trigger microthrombogenesis. This process produces ""microthrombi strings"" composed of platelet-ULVWF complexes, leading to endotheliopathy-associated VMTD (EA-VMTD). In COVID-19, microthrombosis initially affects the lungs per tropism causing ARDS, but EA-VMTD may orchestrate more complex clinical phenotypes, including thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)-like syndrome, hepatic coagulopathy, MODS and combined micro-macrothrombotic syndrome. In this pandemic, ARDS and pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) have often coexisted. The analysis based on two hemostatic theories supports ARDS caused by activated ULVWF path is EA-VMTD and PTE caused by activated ULVWF and TF paths is macrothrombosis. The thrombotic disorder of COVID-19 sepsis is consistent with the notion that ARDS is virus-induced disseminated EA-VMTD and PTE is in-hospital vascular injury-related macrothrombosis which is not directly related to viral pathogenesis. The pathogenesis-based therapeutic approach is discussed for the treatment of EA-VMTD with antimicrothrombotic regimen and the potential need of anticoagulation therapy for coinciding macrothrombosis in comprehensive COVID-19 care.","Chang, Jae C",Vasc Health Risk Manag,,415

The pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) warrants the need for a maximum coverage vaccine. Moreover, mutations that arise within the virus have a significant impact on the vaccination strategy. Here, we built a comprehensive in silico workflow pipeline to identify B-cell- and T-cell-stimulating antigens of SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins. Our in silico reverse vaccinology (RV) approach consisted of two parts: (1) analysis of the selected viral proteins based on annotated cellular location, antigenicity, allele coverage, epitope density, and mutation density and (2) analysis of the various aspects of the epitopes, including antigenicity, allele coverage, IFN-gamma induction, toxicity, host homology, and site mutational density. After performing a mutation analysis based on the contemporary mutational amino acid substitutions observed in the viral variants, 13 potential epitopes were selected as subunit vaccine candidates. Despite mutational amino acid substitutions, most epitope sequences were predicted to retain immunogenicity without toxicity and host homology. Our RV approach using an in silico pipeline may potentially reduce the time required for effective vaccine development and can be applicable for vaccine development for other pathogenic diseases as well.","Hisham, Y.; Ashhab, Y.; Hwang, S.

The aim of this study is to test the relationship between religious coping and health anxiety in Pakistani Muslims. The online survey method was used to collect data from 408 respondents. Structural equational modeling was performed, with results indicating that people who are suffering with health anxiety opt for religious coping (ß = .54, R2 = .29, p < .001). We conclude that it is important to consider the role of religion and spirituality during pandemic-induced anxiety.

Tandem repeated envelope domain â ¢ (ED â ¢ × 3) induced highly total IgG and neutralization antibody, as well as CD8+ T cell responses. Also, stem region-removed envelope (E &#916;STEM) elicited a robust production of IFN-Î³ in mice. To examine in vivo protection, we used mice treated with an IFNAR1 blocking antibody before and after the challenge. Vaccination with the two candidates led to a decline in the level of viral RNAs in organs. Moreover, the sera from the vaccinated mice did not enhance the infection of Dengue virus in K562 cells. These findings suggest the potential for the development of a novel ZIKV DNA vaccine.","In, Hyun Ju; Lee, Yun Ha; Jang, Sundong; Lim, Hee Ji; Kim, Mi Young; Kim, Joo Ae; Yoo, Jung-Sik; Chung, Gyung Tae; Kim, You-Jin",Virology,,415
481799,Nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis in a patient with gastric cancer and SARS-CoV-2 infection,2021,"Two prominent models emerged as a result of intense interdisciplinary discussions on the environmental health paradigm, called the ""exposome"" concept and the ""adverse outcome pathway"" (AOP) concept that links a molecular initiating event to the adverse outcome via key events. Here, evidence is discussed, suggesting that environmental stress/injury-induced damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) may operate as an essential integrating element of both environmental health research paradigms. DAMP-promoted controlled/uncontrolled innate/adaptive immune responses reflect the key events of the AOP concept. The whole process starting from exposure to a distinct environmental stress/injury-associated with the presence/emission of DAMPs-up to the manifestation of a disease may be regarded as an exposome. Clinical examples of such a scenario are briefly sketched, in particular, a model in relation to the emerging COVID-19 pandemic, where the interaction of noninfectious environmental factors (e.g., particulate matter) and infectious factors (SARS CoV-2) may promote SARS case fatality via superimposition of both exogenous and endogenous DAMPs.","Land, Walter Gottlieb",Int J Environ Res,,415

Preparedness and reorganization ahead of the wave to increase ICU surge capacity may be associated with favorable outcome. The purpose of this study was to report our experience in terms of ICU organization and anticipation, as well as reporting patient characteristics, treatment, and outcomes. Design: A prospective observational study. Setting: The division of intensive care at the Geneva University Hospitals (Geneva, Switzerland). Patients: All consecutive adult patients with acute respiratory failure due to coronavirus disease 2019 admitted in the ICU between March 9, 2020, and May 19, 2020, were enrolled. Patients' demographic data, comorbidities, laboratory values, treatments, and clinical outcomes were collected. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: The ICU was reorganized into cells of six to eight patients under the care of three physicians and five nurses. Its capacity increased from 30 to 110 beds, fully equipped and staffed, transforming the surgical intermediate care unit, the postoperative care facility, and operating theaters into ICUs. Surge capacity has always exceeded the number of patients hospitalized. Among 129 critically ill patients with severe acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, 96% required invasive mechanical ventilation. A total of 105 patients (81%) were discharged alive and 24 died, corresponding to a mortality of 19%. Patients who died were significantly older, with higher severity scores at admission, had higher levels of d-dimers, plasma creatinine, high-sensitive troponin T, C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin, and required more frequent prone sessions. Conclusions: A rapid increase in ICU bed capacity, including adequate equipment and staffing, allowed for a large number of critically ill coronavirus disease 2019 patients to be taken care of within a short period of time. Anticipation and preparedness ahead of the wave may account for the low mortality observed in our center. These results highlight the importance of resources management strategy in the context of the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.","Primmaz, Steve; Le Terrier, Christophe; Suh, Noémie; Ventura, François; Boroli, Filippo; Bendjelid, Karim; Cereghetti, Sara; Giraud, Raphaël; Heidegger, Claudia; Pugin, Deborah; Siegenthaler, Nils; Tassaux, Didier; Cabrol, Jean-Clément; Dolet, Nathan; Ellenberger, Christoph; Keli Barcelos, Gleicy; Licker, Marc-Joseph; Savoldelli, Georges; Schiffer, Eduardo; Gayet-Ageron, Angèle; Kaiser, Laurent; Tramèr, Martin R; Pugin, Jérôme",Crit Care Explor,,415

We analysed 70 COVID-19 cases combined with HBV infection (CHI) to determine the epidemiological, clinical characteristics, treatment and outcome. We investigated clinical presentation, imaging and laboratory parameters of COVID-19 patients of seven hospitals from Jan 20 to March 20, 2020. Multivariate analysis was used to analyse risk factors for progression of patients with COVID-19 combined with HBV infection. Compared with COVID-19 without HBV infection (WHI) group, patients with dual infection had a higher proportion of severe/critically ill disease (32.86% vs. 15.27%, P = .000), higher levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST) and activated partial thromboplastin (APTT) [50(28-69)vs 21(14-30), P = .000; 40(25-54) vs 23(18-30), P = .000; 34.0(27.2-38.7) vs 37.2(31.1-41.4), P = .031]. The utilization rates of Arbidol and immunoglobulin were significantly higher than those in the co-infected group [48.57% vs. 35.64%, P < .05; 21.43% vs. 8.18%, P < .001], while the utilization rate of chloroquine phosphate was lower (1.43% vs 14.00%, P < .05) in the co-infected patients group. Age and c-reactive protein (CRP) level were independent risk factors for recovery of patients with COVID-19 combined with HBV infection. The original characteristics of COVID-19 cases combined with HBV infection were higher rate of liver injury, coagulation disorders, severe/critical tendency and increased susceptibility. The elderly and patients with higher level of CRP were more likely to experience a severe outcome of COVID-19.","Wu, Jian; Yu, Jiong; Shi, Xiaowei; Li, Wei; Song, Shu; Zhao, Liangping; Zhao, Xinguo; Liu, Jun; Wang, Dawei; Liu, Chengyuan; Huang, Biao; Meng, Yiling; Jiang, Bin; Deng, Yijun; Cao, Hongcui; Li, Lanjuan",J. viral hepat,,415

Louisiana was one of the states hit hardest by the pandemic with just over 57,000 laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 by the end of June 2020. We reviewed the electronic medical records (EMR) of patients hospitalized during the peak of the pandemic, March 1st through March 31st, to document the type and frequency of neurological problems seen in patients with COVID-19 at presentation to the emergency room. Secondary aims were to determine: 1) the frequency of neurological complaints during the hospital stay; 2) whether the presence of any neurological complaint at presentation or any of the individual types of neurological complaints at admission predicted three separate outcomes: death, length of hospital stay, or the need for intubation; and 3) if the presence of any neurological complaint or any of the individual types of neurological complaints developed during hospital stay predicted the previous three outcomes. A large proportion of our sample (80 %) was African American and had hypertension (79 %). Out of 250 patients, 56 (22 %) patients died, and 72 (29 %) patients required intubation. Thirty-four (14 %) had a neurological chief complaint at presentation; the most common neurological chief complaints in the entire sample were altered mental status (AMS) (8 %), headache (2 %), and syncope (2 %). We used a competing risk model to determine whether neurological symptoms at presentation or during hospital stay were predictors of prolonged hospital stay and death. To establish whether neurological symptoms were associated with higher odds of intubation, we used logistic regression. Age was the only significant demographic predictor of death and hospital stay. The HR (95 %CI) for remaining in the hospital for a ten-year increase in age was 1.2, (1.1, 1.3, pâ¯<â¯0.0001), and for death was 1.3, (1.1, 1.5, pâ¯<â¯0.01). There were no demographic characteristics, including age or comorbidities predictive of intubation. Adjusting for age, patients who at presentation had neurological issues as their chief complaint were at significantly increased risk for remaining in the hospital, HRâ¯=â¯1.7, (1.1,2.5, pâ¯=â¯0.0001), and dying, HRâ¯=â¯2.1(1.1,3.8, pâ¯=â¯0.02), compared to patients without any neurological complaint. Of the individual admission complaints, AMS was associated with a significantly prolonged hospital stay, HRâ¯=â¯1.8, (1.0-3.3, pâ¯=â¯0.05). Patients that required dialysis or intubation or had AMS during hospitalization had more extended hospital stays. After adjusting for age, dialysis, and intubation, patients with AMS during hospital stay had a HR of 1.6, (1.1, 2.5, pâ¯=â¯0.01) for remaining in the hospital. Patients who had statistically significant higher odds of requiring intubation were those who presented with any neurological chief complaint, ORâ¯=â¯2.8 (1.3,5.8, pâ¯=â¯0.01), or with headaches ORâ¯=â¯13.3 (2.1,257.0, pâ¯=â¯0.008). Patients with AMS during the hospital stay, as well as those who had seizures, were more likely to need intubation. In the multivariate model, dialysis, ORâ¯=â¯4.9 (2.6,9.4, pâ¯<â¯0.0001), and AMS, ORâ¯=â¯8.8 (3.9,21.2, pâ¯<â¯0.0001), were the only independent predictors of intubation. Neurological complaints at presentation and during the hospital stay are associated with a higher risk of death, prolonged hospital stay, and intubation. More work is needed to determine whether the cause of the neurological complaints was direct CNS involvement by the virus or the other systemic complications of the virus.","Chachkhiani, David; Soliman, Michael Y; Barua, Delphi; Isakadze, Marine; Villemarette-Pittman, Nicole R; Devier, Deidre J; Lovera, Jesus F",Clin Neurol Neurosurg,,415

Due to the ongoing pecuniary disaster that ensued because of COVID-19, many immigrants are coming back to their ancestry from different migrant-friendly countries for several reasons. In this paper, a novel approach has been proposed to segregate these countries into five vulnerability labels based on probabilistic likelihood score (LHS) and unsupervised clustering algorithms (CA). A survey dataset of returnee people including various information has been collected and leveraged as attributes in this study. Depending on the dissemination of attributes, LHS has been generated using Bayes' Theorem for each vulnerable country and three unsupervised mining algorithms (KMeans++, Agglomerative and BIRCH) have been applied to the LHS for categorization. Output labels obtained from CA are then evaluated appropriating the average LHS. Multiple performance measurement metrics (Adjusted Rand Index, Mutual Information based Score) have been consolidated to get an incisive comparison of vulnerability labels resulting from CA and expected LHS. The highest value of 0.74 has been attained as Normalized Mutual Information based Score for BIRCH clustering accompanying ample results for the remaining algorithms. The result has shown that the combined application of probabilistic LHS and unsupervised CA can be a reliable method to identify the vulnerability of different countries generally chosen by migrant people. © 2021 IEEE.","Bhowmik, S.; Reno, S.; Sultana, S.; Ahmed, M.","Int.

488568,Mortality in children with positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction test: Lessons learned from a tertiary referral hospital in Indonesia,2021,"BACKGROUND: Although with exceptions, evidence seems to indicate that children have lower susceptibility than adults to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. When infected, children generally remain asymptomatic or develop mild disease. A small number of pediatric cases required admission to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), respiratory support with a mechanical ventilation and additional life-saving interventions. Even if rarely, death can occur. Aim of this manuscript is to highlight the risk factors associated with severe outcome among pediatric patients with COVID-19. MAIN FINDINGS: Early identification of SARS-CoV-2-infected children at risk of developing severe COVID-19 is vital for service planning, as severely affected pediatric patients require high-quality care and should be followed only where an adequately structured PICU is available. However, early identification of children who must be carefully monitored for substantial risk of severe COVID-19 remains difficult. An underlying comorbidity and heart involvement are frequently observed in severe paediatric cases. Reduced left ventricular systolic function with an ejection fraction < 60%; diastolic dysfunction; and arrhythmias, including ST segment changes, QTc prolongation, and premature atrial or ventricular beat, are the earliest manifestations of heart involvement. Inclusion of heart enzyme serum levels and evaluation of ventricular function among predictive markers could lead to a more effective evaluation of children at risk with proper selection of those to admit to the PICU and with more adequate treatment in case of more severe clinical manifestations. CONCLUSIONS: To appropriately manage severe pediatric COVID-19 cases, greater attention should be paid to risk factors in children and adolescents, especially to cardiovascular alterations (e.g., heart enzyme serum levels and evaluation of ventricular function). Further studies are needed and the development of a validated score based on all the most common presumed markers of disease severity seems essential.","Esposito, Susanna; Caramelli, Fabio; Principi, Nicola",Ital J Pediatr,,415

Currently, observations within US contexts are lacking; therefore, we report on the rapid implementation of telepsychiatry and workflow experiences in a psychiatric practice based within a large health care system in southeast Texas with a national catchment area. We discuss the logistics of the implementation, including modes of communication, scheduling, coordination, and capacity; the psychological effects of web-based services, including both the loss of the physical therapeutic environment and the unique interpersonal dynamics experienced in the virtual environment; and postadoption patterns of engagement with our services and with other clinical functions affected by the rapid adaptation to telemedicine. Our art therapy group programming serves as an applied case study, demonstrating the value of a well-managed web-based program (eg, patients were receptive and well-engaged, and they appreciated the continuity of accessible service) as well as the challenges (eg, the need for backup plans and technological fallbacks, managing interruptions and telecommunication learning curves, and working around the difference in resources for art and music therapy between a well-stocked clinical setting versus clients' home spaces). We conclude from our experience that the overall strengths of telepsychiatry include receptive and well-engaged responses from patients as well as the expansion of boundaries, which provides a directly contextualized view into patients' home lives. Challenges and corresponding recommendations include the need for more careful safety planning for high-risk patients; maintaining professional boundaries in the newly informal virtual setting; designing the physical space to both frame the patient encounter and maintain work-life balance for the therapist; allowing for delays and interruptions (including an initial acclimation session); and preserving interprofessional care team collaboration when the physical locations that normally facilitate such encounters are not accessible. We believe that careful observations of the strengths and challenges of telepsychiatry during this pandemic will better inform practices that are considering telepsychiatry adoption both within pandemic contexts and more broadly thereafter.","Sasangohar, Farzan; Bradshaw, Major R; Carlson, Marianne Millen; Flack, James N; Fowler, James C; Freeland, Diana; Head, John; Marder, Kate; Orme, William; Weinstein, Benjamin; Kolman, Jacob M; Kash, Bita; Madan, Alok",J Med Internet Res,,415

The uptake of Agile methods has been driven by their flexibility, making them more suitable for many teams when compared to traditional approaches. However, an inevitable expectation for an Agile workflow is a higher level of change and uncertainty regarding requirements and tasks, which can ultimately have impacts on team member emotional states. The extent of such emotion impacts has motivated our research into the manner in which emotional states evolve in an Agile setting, along with whether such emotions can be accurately measured. To this end, we have developed Emotimonitor, a Trello power-up designed to capture information on emotions of team members as they relate to their technical tasks through a user-friendly interface. Emotimonitor will better enable team members to express their emotional states through emoji reactions on Trello cards, while also providing team leaders with a dashboard summarising these reactions as visualisations and statistical data. It is extensible and potentially provides an outlet for team members operating in Agile environments to better express their emotional states.","El-Migid, Mohammed-Amr Abd; Cai, Damon; Niven, Thomas; Vo, Jeffrey; Madampe, Kashumi; Grundy, John; Hoda, Rashina",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.01952v2.pdf,415

493032,Prospective multicentre cohort study of transthoracic echocardiography provision in the South West of the UK during the first wave of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic,2021,"Background: Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped positive-strand RNA viruses which have club-like spikes at the surface with a unique replication process. Coronaviruses are categorized as major pathogenic viruses causing a variety of diseases in birds and mammals including humans (lethal respiratory dysfunctions). Nowadays, a new strain of coronaviruses is identified and named as SARS-CoV-2. Multiple cases of SARS-CoV-2 attacks are being reported all over the world. SARS-CoV-2 showed high death rate; however, no specific treatment is available against SARS-CoV-2. Methods: In the current study, immunoinformatics approaches were employed to predict the antigenic epitopes against SARS-CoV-2 for the development of the coronavirus vaccine. Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte and B-cell epitopes were predicted for SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus protein. Multiple sequence alignment of three genomes (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2) was used to conserved binding domain analysis. Results: The docking complexes of 4 CTL epitopes with antigenic sites were analyzed followed by binding affinity and binding interaction analyses of top-ranked predicted peptides with MHC-I HLA molecule. The molecular docking (Food and Drug Regulatory Authority library) was performed, and four compounds exhibiting least binding energy were identified. The designed epitopes lead to the molecular docking against MHC-I, and interactional analyses of the selected docked complexes were investigated. In conclusion, four CTL epitopes (GTDLEGNFY, TVNVLAWLY, GSVGFNIDY, and QTFSVLACY) and four FDA-scrutinized compounds exhibited potential targets as peptide vaccines and potential biomolecules against deadly SARS-CoV-2, respectively. A multiepitope vaccine was also designed from different epitopes of coronavirus proteins joined by linkers and led by an adjuvant. Conclusion: Our investigations predicted epitopes and the reported molecules that may have the potential to inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 virus. These findings can be a step towards the development of a peptide-based vaccine or natural compound drug target against SARS-CoV-2.","Waqas, Muhammad; Haider, Ali; Rehman, Abdur; Qasim, Muhammad; Umar, Ahitsham; Sufyan, Muhammad; Akram, Hafiza Nisha; Mir, Asif; Razzaq, Roha; Rasool, Danish; Tahir, Rana Adnan; Sehgal, Sheikh Arslan",Biomed Res Int,,415
493905,A case of probable Parkinson's disease after SARS-CoV-2 infection,2020,"The recent COVID-19 pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has had a significant impact on human life and the economy around the world. A reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test is used to screen for this disease, but its low sensitivity means that it is not sufficient for early detection and treatment. As RT-PCR is a time-consuming procedure, there is interest in the introduction of automated techniques for diagnosis. Deep learning has a key role to play in the field of medical imaging. The most important issue in this area is the choice of key features. Here, we propose a set of deep learning features based on a system for automated classification of computed tomography (CT) images to identify COVID-19. Initially, this method was used to prepare a database of three classes: Pneumonia, COVID-19, and Healthy. The dataset consisted of 6000 CT images refined by a hybrid contrast stretching approach. In the next step, two advanced deep learning models (ResNet50 and DarkNet53) were fine-tuned and trained through transfer learning. The features were extracted from the second last feature layer of both models and further optimized using a hybrid optimization approach. For each deep model, the Rao-1 algorithm and the PSO algorithm were combined in the hybrid approach. Later, the selected features were merged using the new minimum parallel distance non-redundant (PMDNR) approach. The final fused vector was finally classified using the extreme machine classifier. The experimental process was carried out on a set of prepared data with an overall accuracy of 95.6%. Comparing the different classification algorithms at the different levels of the features demonstrated the reliability of the proposed framework. © 2021 Tech Science Press.

498675,Lack of association between ABO blood groups and susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection,2021,"Covid-19 infections and related illness and death are rightly at the forefront of our minds. It is critical that we consider how to reduce infections, treat those who are ill and protect health systems. We must, however, also consider how the pandemic is affecting the families of those infected, and how interventions to prevent the spread of the virus come with large negative economic and social consequences. We must begin to identify the ways in which we can soften these blows and recover from the negative consequences over the medium and long-term. We highlight here the importance of moving away the tendency to search for interventions to improve one outcome at a time. It will be essential, particularly in highly resource constrained settings, to look for accelerators, interventions which improve multiple outcomes simultaneously. We discuss how this will be especially important for groups who are at particular risk at this time, including of long-term negative outcomes. These include very young children, adolescents and those who have limited capacity to benefit from narrow interventions given critical needs in multiple domains. Searching for accelerators requires that we take a step back and look to identify common causes of negative outcomes and consider how we might address them. For many countries, recovery from this epidemic will be highly constrained by the limited availability of financial resources. Wise investments will be especially important at this time.","Desmond, Chris; Sherr, Lorraine; Cluver, Lucie",Vulnerable Child. Youth Stud.,,415
499194,SARS-CoV-2 infection and the gut-liver axis,2020,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is the most informative pandemic in history. These unprecedented recorded data give rise to some novel concepts, discussions and models. Macroscopic modeling of the period of hospitalization is one of these new issues. METHODS: Modeling of the lag between diagnosis and death is done by using two classes of macroscopic analytical methods: the correlation-based methods based on Pearson, Spearman and Kendall correlation coefficients, and the logarithmic methods of two types. Also, we apply eight weighted average methods to smooth the time series before calculating the distance. We consider five lags with the least distance. All the computations are conducted on Matlab R2015b. RESULTS: The length of hospitalization for the fatal cases in the USA, Italy and Germany are 2-10, 1-6 and 5-19 days, respectively. Overall, this length in the USA is 2 days more than that in Italy and 5 days less than that in Germany. CONCLUSION: We take the distance between the diagnosis and death as the length of hospitalization. There is a negative association between the length of hospitalization and the case fatality rate. Therefore, the estimation of the length of hospitalization by using these macroscopic mathematical methods can be introduced as an indicator to scale the success of the countries fighting the ongoing pandemic.","Jamshidi, Babak; Jamshidi Zargaran, Shahriar; Bekrizadeh, Hakim; Rezaei, Mansour; Najafi, Farid",Int. j. qual. health care,,415

It is hypothesized that the lipid bilayer that surrounds the SARS-CoV-2 improves its ability to remain stable on sebum-rich skin and serves as another possible route of contracting the virus. One possible aspect of these observations that has yet to be explored in detail is what role arthropods that have been associated with human skin infestation, such as Demodecidae or Pyemotidae species, play in viral transmission. It seems likely that arthropod-coronavirus interactions may take place through the molecular attraction forces between the chitin found on the exoskeleton of mites commonly found on human skin and the lipids present on the viral envelope of the SARS-CoV-2. We believe this may mean that arthropods are currently an overlooked cofactor in viral infection which may have some important biomedical implications for both prevention and treatment.","Tatu, Alin Laurentiu; Nadasdy, Thomas; Nwabudike, Lawrence Chukwudi",Dermatol Ther,,415

We aimed to explore the role of hydroxychloroquine therapy in mildly symptomatic patients diagnosed in the outpatient setting. METHODS: We examined the association between outpatient hydroxychloroquine exposure and the subsequent progression of disease among mildly symptomatic non-hospitalized patients with documented SARS-CoV-2 infection. The primary outcome assessed was requirement of hospitalization. Data was obtained from a retrospective review of electronic health records within a New Jersey USA multi-hospital network. We compared outcomes in patients who received hydroxychloroquine with those who did not applying a multivariable logistic model with propensity matching. RESULTS: Among 1274 outpatients with documented SARS-CoV-2 infection 7.6% were prescribed hydroxychloroquine. In a 1067 patient propensity matched cohort, 21.6% with outpatient exposure to hydroxychloroquine were hospitalized, and 31.4% without exposure were hospitalized. In the primary multivariable logistic regression analysis with propensity matching there was an association between exposure to hydroxychloroquine and a decreased rate of hospitalization from COVID-19 (OR 0.53; 95% CI, 0.29, 0.95). Sensitivity analyses revealed similar associations. QTc prolongation events occurred in 2% of patients prescribed hydroxychloroquine with no reported arrhythmia events among those with data available. CONCLUSIONS: In this retrospective observational study of SARS-CoV-2 infected non-hospitalized patients hydroxychloroquine exposure was associated with a decreased rate of subsequent hospitalization. Additional exploration of hydroxychloroquine in this mildly symptomatic outpatient population is warranted.","Ip, Andrew; Ahn, Jaeil; Zhou, Yizhao; Goy, Andre H; Hansen, Eric; Pecora, Andrew L; Sinclaire, Brittany A; Bednarz, Urszula; Marafelias, Michael; Sawczuk, Ihor S; Underwood, Joseph P; Walker, David M; Prasad, Rajiv; Sweeney, Robert L; Ponce, Marie G; La Capra, Samuel; Cunningham, Frank J; Calise, Arthur G; Pulver, Bradley L; Ruocco, Dominic; Mojares, Greggory E; Eagan, Michael P; Ziontz, Kristy L; Mastrokyriakos, Paul; Goldberg, Stuart L",BMC Infect Dis,,415

Methods: This prospective, randomized study assigned subjects (n=67) to either conventional surgical face mask or Lamdong Medical College (LMC) face mask for three hours. Fractional concentration of nitric oxide in exhaled breath (FENO) and peak expiratory flow (PEF) was measured before and after mask use. Subjective reporting on respiratory symptoms was also analyzed. Masks were then incubated and analyzed for microorganism growth. Results: Subjects assigned the LMC mask had a lowered FENO (p<0.05) compared to conventional face masks after mask wearing. Subjects with LMC mask use reported higher comfortability (p<0.05), breathability (p<0.05), and lower allergy symptoms (p<0.05). The LMC mask has visually less microorganism growth in the cultured medium, measured by sterile ring radius.

503737,Electrocardiographic findings at presentation and clinical outcome in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection,2020,"BACKGROUND: As the COVID-19 epidemic increases in severity, the burden of quarantine stations outside emergency departments (EDs) at hospitals is increasing daily. To address the high screening workload at quarantine stations, all staff members with medical licenses are required to work shifts in these stations. Therefore, it is necessary to simplify the workflow and decision-making process for physicians and surgeons from all subspecialties. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to demonstrate how the National Cheng Kung University Hospital artificial intelligence (AI) trilogy of diversion to a smart quarantine station, AI-assisted image interpretation, and a built-in clinical decision-making algorithm improves medical care and reduces quarantine processing times. METHODS: This observational study on the emerging COVID-19 pandemic included 643 patients. An ""AI trilogy"" of diversion to a smart quarantine station, AI-assisted image interpretation, and a built-in clinical decision-making algorithm on a tablet computer was applied to shorten the quarantine survey process and reduce processing time during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: The use of the AI trilogy facilitated the processing of suspected cases of COVID-19 with or without symptoms; also, travel, occupation, contact, and clustering histories were obtained with the tablet computer device. A separate AI-mode function that could quickly recognize pulmonary infiltrates on chest x-rays was merged into the smart clinical assisting system (SCAS), and this model was subsequently trained with COVID-19 pneumonia cases from the GitHub open source data set. The detection rates for posteroanterior and anteroposterior chest x-rays were 55/59 (93%) and 5/11 (45%), respectively. The SCAS algorithm was continuously adjusted based on updates to the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control public safety guidelines for faster clinical decision making. Our ex vivo study demonstrated the efficiency of disinfecting the tablet computer surface by wiping it twice with 75% alcohol sanitizer. To further analyze the impact of the AI application in the quarantine station, we subdivided the station group into groups with or without AI. Compared with the conventional ED (n=281), the survey time at the quarantine station (n=1520) was significantly shortened; the median survey time at the ED was 153 minutes (95% CI 108.5-205.0), vs 35 minutes at the quarantine station (95% CI 24-56; P<.001). Furthermore, the use of the AI application in the quarantine station reduced the survey time in the quarantine station; the median survey time without AI was 101 minutes (95% CI 40-153), vs 34 minutes (95% CI 24-53) with AI in the quarantine station (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: The AI trilogy improved our medical care workflow by shortening the quarantine survey process and reducing the processing time, which is especially important during an emerging infectious disease epidemic.","Liu, Ping-Yen; Tsai, Yi-Shan; Chen, Po-Lin; Tsai, Huey-Pin; Hsu, Ling-Wei; Wang, Chi-Shiang; Lee, Nan-Yao; Huang, Mu-Shiang; Wu, Yun-Chiao; Ko, Wen-Chien; Yang, Yi-Ching; Chiang, Jung-Hsien; Shen, Meng-Ru",J Med Internet Res,,415

504545,In the Spiral of History: SARS-Cov-2 infection,2021,"BACKGROUND: The spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), has been characterized as a worldwide pandemic. Currently, there are few preclinical animal models that suitably represent infection, as the main point of entry to human cells is via human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) which is not present in typical preclinical mouse strains. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 is highly virulent and unsafe for use in many research facilities. Here we describe the development of a preclinical animal model using intranasal administration of ACE2 followed by non-infectious SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus (PsV) challenge. METHODS: To specifically generate our SARS-CoV-2 PsV, we used a lentivirus system. Following co-transfection with a packaging plasmid containing HIV Gag and Pol, luciferase-expressing lentiviruses, and a plasmid carrying the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, SARS-CoV-2 PsVs can be isolated and purified. To better understand and maximize the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 PsV, we generated PsV carrying spike protein variants known to have varying human ACE2 binding properties, including 19 deletion (19del) and 19del + D614G. RESULTS: Our system demonstrated the ability of PsVs to infect the respiratory passage of mice following intranasal hACE2 transduction. Additionally, we demonstrate in vitro and in vivo manipulability of our system using recombinant receptor-binding domain protein to prevent PsV infection. CONCLUSIONS: Our PsV system is able to model SARS-CoV-2 infections in a preclinical mouse model and can be used to test interventions or preventative treatments. We believe that this method can be extended to work in various mouse strains or to model infection with different coronaviruses. A simple in vivo system such as our model is crucial for rapidly and effectively responding to the current COVID-19 pandemic in addition to preparing for future potential coronavirus outbreaks.","Tseng, Ssu-Hsueh; Lam, Brandon; Kung, Yu Jui; Lin, John; Liu, Li; Tsai, Ya Chea; Ferrall, Louise; Roden, Richard B S; Wu, T C; Hung, Chien-Fu",J Biomed Sci,,415

The authors found no significant difference in mechanical ventilation parameters between patients who developed PNX/PMD and those who did not. Mechanical ventilation parameters were within recommended limits for protective ventilation in both groups. Ninety-five percent of patients with PNX/PMD had the Macklin effect (linear collections of air contiguous to the bronchovascular sheaths) on a baseline computed tomography scan, and tended to have a higher lung involvement at intensive care unit (ICU) admission (Radiographic Assessment of Lung Edema score 32.2 ± 13.4 v 18.7 ± 9.8 in patients without PNX/PMD, pâ¯=â¯0.08). Time from symptom onset to intubation and time from total bilirubin on day two after ICU admission were the only independent predictors of PNX/PMD. Mortality was 60.7% in patients who developed PNX/PMD versus 38.6% in those who did not (pâ¯=â¯0.04). CONCLUSION: PNX/PMD occurs frequently in COVID-19 patients with ARDS requiring mechanical ventilation, and is associated with increased mortality. Development of PNX/PMD seems to occur despite use of protective mechanical ventilation and has a radiologic predictor sign.","Belletti, Alessandro; Palumbo, Diego; Zangrillo, Alberto; Fominskiy, Evgeny V; Franchini, Stefano; Dell039,; Acqua, Antonio; Marinosci, Alessandro; Monti, Giacomo; Vitali, Giordano; Colombo, Sergio; Guazzarotti, Giorgia; Lembo, Rosalba; Maimeri, Nicolò; Faustini, Carolina; Pennella, Renato; Mushtaq, Junaid; Landoni, Giovanni; Scandroglio, Anna Mara; Dagna, Lorenzo; De Cobelli, Francesco",J. cardiothoracic vasc. anest,,415
505567,Evolution of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and clusters in school children from June 2020 to April 2021 reflect community transmission: prospective cohort study Ciao Corona,2021,"In evaluating the appropriate response to the COVID-19 pandemic, a key parameter is the rate of substitution between wealth and mortality risk, conventionally summarized as the value per statistical life (VSL). For the United States, VSL is estimated as approximately $10 million, which implies the value of preventing 100,000 COVID-19 deaths is $1 trillion. Is this value too large? There are reasons to think so. First, VSL is a marginal rate of substitution and the potential risk reductions are non-marginal. The standard VSL model implies the rate of substitution of wealth for risk reduction is smaller when the risk reduction is larger, but a closed-form solution calibrated to estimates of the income elasticity of VSL shows the rate of decline is modest until the value of a non-marginal risk reduction accounts for a substantial share of income; average individuals are predicted to be willing to spend more than half their income to reduce one-year mortality risk by 1 in 100. Second, mortality risk is concentrated among the elderly, for whom VSL may be smaller and who would benefit from a persistent risk reduction for a shorter period because of their shorter life expectancy. Third, the pandemic and responses to it have caused substantial losses in income that should decrease VSL. In contrast, VSL is plausibly larger for risks (like COVID-19) that are dreaded, uncertain, catastrophic, and ambiguous. These arguments are evaluated and key issues for improving estimates are highlighted.","Hammitt, James K",J Risk Uncertain,,415
505750,SARS-CoV-2 infection and neonates: a review of evidence and unresolved questions,2020,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: COVID-19 outbreak has created havoc and a quick cure for the disease will be a therapeutic medicine that has usage history in patients to resolve the current pandemic. With technological advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) coupled with increased computational power, the AI-empowered drug repurposing can prove beneficial in the COVID-19 scenario. METHODS: The recent literature is studied and analyzed from various sources such as Scopus, Google Scholar, PubMed, and IEEE Xplore databases. The search terms used are 'COVID-19', ' AI ', and 'Drug Repurposing'. RESULTS: AI is implemented in the field design through the generation of the learning-prediction model and performs a quick virtual screening to accurately display the output. With a drug-repositioning strategy, AI can quickly detect drugs that can fight against emerging diseases such as COVID-19. This technology has the potential to improve the drug discovery, planning, treatment, and reported outcomes of the COVID-19 patient, being an evidence-based medical tool. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, there are chances that the application of the AI approach in drug discovery is feasible. With prior usage experiences in patients, few of the old drugs, if shown active against SARS-CoV-2, can be readily applied to treat the COVID-19 patients. With the collaboration of AI with pharmacology, the efficiency of drug repurposing can improve significantly.","Mohanty, Sweta; Harun Ai Rashid, Md; Mridul, Mayank; Mohanty, Chandana; Swayamsiddha, Swati",Diabetes Metab Syndr,,415

Expression of the TXNIP gene is regulated by DNA methylation. However, no study has reported the influence of lifestyle factors on TXNIP DNA methylation. Our goal was to determine the association between smoking habits and TXNIP DNA methylation levels in a Japanese population. We conducted a cross-sectional study of 417 subjects (180 males and 237 females) participating in a health examination. We used a pyrosequencing assay to determine TXNIP DNA methylation levels in leukocytes. The mean TXNIP DNA methylation level in current smokers (75.3%) was significantly lower than that in never and ex-smokers (never: 78.1%, p < 0.001; ex: 76.9%, p = 0.013). Multivariable logistic regression analyses showed that the OR for TXNIP DNA hypomethylation was significantly higher in current smokers than that in never smokers, and significantly higher in current smokers with years of smoking &#8805; 35 and Brinkman Index &#8805; 600 compared to that in non-smokers. In conclusion, we found that current smokers had TXNIP DNA hypomethylation compared to never and ex-smokers.

507225,"SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among blood donors in Québec, and analysis of symptoms associated with seropositivity: a nested case-control study",2021,"A one-dimensional droplet evaporation model is used to estimate the droplet lifetime from evaporation in air. The mathematical model invokes assumptions of spherical symmetry, ideal gas mixture, binary diffusion, no re-condensation on droplet surface, and constant properties. Four initial droplet diameters (0.001, 0.01, 0.1, and 1â¯mm), two ambient temperatures (20 and 30â¯oC) and a range of ambient relative humidity are considered. For the conditions studied, the results show that the ambient relative humidity plays an important role in the droplet lifetime calculation. Increasing the ambient temperature does not necessarily decrease the droplet lifetime; it occurs only when the ambient relative humidity is set below 37%. When the ambient relative humidity is higher than 37%, the higher ambient temperature (30â¯oC) results in a longer droplet lifetime for the same initial droplet diameter considered. The results also suggest that there may exist a critical ambient relative humidity; beyond which, the droplet lifetime will increase exponentially. For ambient temperature at 30â¯oC, the critical ambient relative humidity is around 55.7%. It must be mentioned that the results of this study do not imply that the COVID-19 virus will be deactivated at the end of the droplet lifetime. The study simply shows the potential effects resulting from the ambient temperature and ambient relative humidity on virus carrying drops.","Chen, Lea-Der",Int J Hyg Environ Health,,415
507226,"SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among blood donors in Québec, and analysis of symptoms associated with seropositivity: a nested case-control study",2021,"BACKGROUND: Long-term care (LTC) homes have been the epicentre of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in Canada to date. Previous research shows that for-profit LTC homes deliver inferior care across a variety of outcome and process measures, raising the question of whether for-profit homes have had worse COVID-19 outcomes than nonprofit homes. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all LTC homes in Ontario, Canada, from Mar. 29 to May 20, 2020, using a COVID-19 outbreak database maintained by the Ontario Ministry of Long-Term Care. We used hierarchical logistic and count-based methods to model the associations between profit status of LTC homes (for-profit, nonprofit or municipal) and COVID-19 outbreaks in LTC homes, the extent of COVID-19 outbreaks (number of residents infected), and deaths of residents from COVID-19. RESULTS: The analysis included all 623 Ontario LTC homes, comprising 75 676 residents; 360 LTC homes (57.7%) were for profit, 162 (26.0%) were nonprofit, and 101 (16.2%) were municipal homes. There were 190 (30.5%) outbreaks of COVID-19 in LTC homes, involving 5218 residents and resulting in 1452 deaths, with an overall case fatality rate of 27.8%. The odds of a COVID-19 outbreak were associated with the incidence of COVID-19 in the public health unit region surrounding an LTC home (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.91, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.19-3.05), the number of residents (adjusted OR 1.38, 95% CI 1.18-1.61), and older design standards of the home (adjusted OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.01-2.38), but not profit status. For-profit status was associated with both the extent of an outbreak in an LTC home (adjusted risk ratio [RR] 1.96, 95% CI 1.26-3.05) and the number of resident deaths (adjusted RR 1.78, 95% CI 1.03-3.07), compared with nonprofit homes. These associations were mediated by a higher prevalence of older design standards in for-profit LTC homes and chain ownership. INTERPRETATION: For-profit status is associated with the extent of an outbreak of COVID-19 in LTC homes and the number of resident deaths, but not the likelihood of outbreaks. Differences between for-profit and nonprofit homes are largely explained by older design standards and chain ownership, which should be a focus of infection control efforts and future policy.","Stall, Nathan M; Jones, Aaron; Brown, Kevin A; Rochon, Paula A; Costa, Andrew P",CMAJ,,415

In this study, a blended training programme was conducted for 26 primary care providers (PCPs) from nine districts of Bihar, in best practices for the management of AUDs. A two weeks on-site training was followed by fortnightly online tele-Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes (ECHO) clinics for six months using the 'Hub and Spokes' ECHO model, accessible through internet-enabled smartphones. A questionnaire administered at baseline and after six months assessed changes in the PCPs compliance with principles of AUD management. Significant improvements were noted in compliance to principles in the management of AUDs based on self-report. Over the six months period 2695 individuals were screened, of whom 832 (30.8%) had an AUD Identification Test score of more than 16, indicating harmful use or dependence. The PCPs reported retaining 49.1 per cent of the cases for at least one follow up and needed to refer only 80 (3%) cases to specialists for further management. The ECHO model was found to be effective in training PCPs to provide quality healthcare. To confirm these findings, it needs to be tested in a large number of PCPs with a robust study design.","Mahadevan, Jayant; Shukla, Lekhansh; Chand, Prabhat Kumar; Komaromy, Miriam; Murthy, Pratima; Arora, Sanjeev",Indian J Med Res,,415

This study aimed to determine the performance of the Wavelet-Based Outbreak detection method (WOD (in detecting outbreaks and to compare its performance with the Poisson regression-based model and Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) using data of simulated pertussis outbreaks in Iran. METHOD: The data on suspected cases of pertussis from 25th February 2012 to 23rd March 2018 in Iran was used. The performance of the WOD ( Daubechies 10 and Haar wavelets), Poisson regression-based method, and EWMA Compared in terms of timeliness and detection of outbreak days using the simulation of different outbreaks. In the current study, two simulations were used, one based on retrospectively collected data (literature-based) on pertussis cases and another one on a synthetic data set created by the researchers. The sensitivity, specificity, false alarm, and false-negative rate, positive and negative likelihood ratios, under ROC areas and median timeliness were used to assess the performance of the methods. RESULTS: In a literature-based outbreak simulation, the highest and lowest sensitivity, false negative in the detection of injected outbreaks were seen in Daubechies 10 (db10), with sensitivity 0.59 (0.56-0.62), and Haar wavelets with 0.57 (0.54-0.60). In the researcher simulated data, the EWMA (K=0.5) with sensitivity 0.92 (0.90-0.94) had the best performance. About timeliness, the WOD methods showed the best performance in the early warning of the outbreak in both simulation approaches. CONCLUSION: Performance of the WOD in the early alarming outbreaks was appropriate. However, this method would be best used along with other methods of public health surveillance.

But in a pandemic, where the primary responsibility of risk management is not centralised within institutional actors but defused across society, trust can become a double-edged sword. Under these conditions, public trust based on a perception of government competence, care and openness may in fact lead people to underestimate risks and thus reduce their belief in the need to take individual action to control the risks. In this paper, we examine the interaction between trust in government, risk perceptions and public compliance in Singapore in the period between January and April 2020. Using social media tracking and online focus group discussions, we present a preliminary assessment of public responses to government risk communication and risk management measures. We highlight the unique deployment of risk communication in Singapore based on the narrative of ‘defensive pessimism’ to heighten rather than lower levels perceived risk. But the persistence of low public risk perceptions and concomitant low levels of compliance with government risk management measures bring to light the paradox of trust. This calls for further reflection on another dimension of trust which focuses on the role of the public; and further investigation into other social and cultural factors that may have stronger influence over individual belief in the need to take personal actions to control the risks.","Wong, Catherine Mei Ling; Jensen, Olivia",J.

Genomic surveillance continues to be a critical effort toward tracking the virus and containing its spread, and more genomes from diverse geographical areas and different time points are needed to provide an appropriate representation of the virus evolution. In this study, we report the successful assembly of one single gapless, unambiguous contiguous sequence representing the complete viral genome from a nasopharyngeal swab of an infected health care worker in Cairo, Egypt. The sequence has all typical features of SARS-CoV-2 genomes, with no protein-disrupting mutations. However, three mutations are worth highlighting and future tracking: a synonymous mutation causing a rare spike S813I variation and two less frequent ones leading to an A41V variation in NSP3, encoded by ORF1a (ORF1a A895V), and a Q677H variation in the spike protein. Both affected proteins, S and NSP3, are relevant to vaccine and drug development. Although the genome, named CU_S3, belongs to the prevalent global genotype, marked by the D614G spike variation, the combined variations in the spike proteins and ORF1a do not co-occur in any of the 197,000 genomes reported to date. Future studies will assess the biological, pathogenic, and epidemiological implications of this set of genetic variations. This line of research is needed to inform vaccine and therapeutic innovation to stem the COVID-19 pandemic.","Soliman, May S; AbdelFattah, May; Aman, Soad M N; Ibrahim, Lamyaa M; Aziz, Ramy K",Omics,,415

515197,"Universal screening for SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic obstetric patients in Tokyo, Japan",2020,"Background: As a consequence of the corona pandemic, universities nationwide had stopped classroom teaching by the start of the summer semester 2020. As part of the second lockdown, in many states schools and day care centers were also closed or reduced to a minimum. In this context the effect of room air filters has already been discussed multiple times; however, mobile devices for air filtration are currently not recommended by the German Federal Environment Agency. The following investigation shows the real effects of mobile air filters on aerosol concentrations when used in lecture theaters, canteens or school learning centers. Methods: The effects of a mobile air purifier (DEMA-airtech, Stuttgart, Germany) were measured in three large rooms (a lecture theater, a company canteen and a learning center of a grammar school). Aerosol and carbon dioxide concentrations were determined with devices from the company Palas (Karlsruhe, Germany). Results: All three scenarios showed a relevant and permanent decrease in aerosol concentrations through the use of air filters. The effect partly even surpassed the effectiveness of simple ventilation by opening the windows. Conclusion: In addition to social distancing and wearing highly efficient face masks, the use air filters is recommended. This measure could enable classroom teaching to be resumed.","Oberst, M; Klar, T; Heinrich, A",Zentralbl Arbeitsmed Arbeitsschutz Ergon,,415
515222,SARS-CoV-2 antibody seroprevalence in NHS healthcare workers in a large double-sited UK hospital,2021,"COVID-19 is an ongoing pandemic with many challenges that are now extending to its intriguing long-term sequel. 'Long-COVID-19' is a term given to the lingering or protracted illness that patients of COVID-19 continue to experience even in their post-recovery phase. It is also being called 'post-acute COVID-19', 'ongoing symptomatic COVID-19', 'chronic COVID-19', 'post COVID-19 syndrome', and 'long-haul COVID-19'. Fatigue, dyspnea, cough, headache, brain fog, anosmia, and dysgeusia are common symptoms seen in Long-COVID-19, but more varied and debilitating injuries involving pulmonary, cardiovascular, cutaneous, musculoskeletal and neuropsychiatric systems are also being reported. With the data on Long-COVID-19 still emerging, the present review aims to highlight its epidemiology, protean clinical manifestations, risk predictors, and management strategies. With the re-emergence of new waves of SARS-CoV-2 infection, Long-COVID-19 is expected to produce another public health crisis on the heels of current pandemic. Thus, it becomes imperative to emphasize this condition and disseminate its awareness to medical professionals, patients, the public, and policymakers alike to prepare and augment health care facilities for continued surveillance of these patients. Further research comprising cataloging of symptoms, longer-ranging observational studies, and clinical trials are necessary to evaluate long-term consequences of COVID-19, and it warrants setting-up of dedicated, post-COVID care, multi-disciplinary clinics, and rehabilitation centers.","Garg, M.; Maralakunte, M.; Garg, S.; Dhooria, S.; Sehgal, I.; Bhalla, A.

Study Design: Descriptive study. Place and Duration of Study: Canakkale Onsekiz Mart University Hospital, Canakkale, Turkey from March to August, 2020. Methodology: A retrospective evaluation of patients, who underwent percutaneous tracheostomy with an aerosol box, was conducted. Patients aged over 18 years, diagnosed with COVID-19 and requiring percutaneous tracheostomy were included. Exclusion criteria were: age under 18 years and refusal to participate in the study. Patients' age, gender, comorbidities, APACHE II scores at intensive care admission, numbers of intubated days, durations of tracheostomy opening time, and complications were recorded. Results: Twenty-four patients underwent the procedure. Tracheostomy was performed successfully in all 24 cases (100%). The mean age of the cases was 67.2 +/- 10.1 years. Four patients experienced minor bleeding related to performing the percutaneous tracheostomy using the aerosol box. No healthcare workers were infected with SARS-CoV-2 while performing the tracheostomy procedure. Conclusion: Use of the aerosol box had adequate efficacy and safety for performance of the percutaneous tracheostomy procedure in intubated patients with COVID-19, who were being followed up in the intensive care unit. This procedure could be used as an alternative to traditional tracheostomy methods in patients with contagious respiratory infections.","Erbas, M.; Dost, B.",Jcpsp-Journal of the College of Physicians and Surgeons Pakistan,,415
516214,Vitamin D and SARS-CoV-2 infection - evolution of evidence supporting clinical practice and policy development,2021,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is known to cause an acute respiratory illness, although clinical manifestations outside of the respiratory tract may occur. Early reports have identified SARS-CoV-2 as a cause of subacute thyroiditis (SAT). METHODS: A systematic review was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. MEDLINE, Web of Science and PubMed databases were queried in February 2021 for studies from December 2019 to February 2021. MeSH search terms ""COVID-19"", ""SARS-CoV-2"" and ""coronavirus"" along with search terms ""thyroiditis"", ""thyrotoxicosis"", ""thyroid"" were used. Descriptive statistics for continuous variables and proportions for categorical variables were calculated. RESULTS: 15 publications reporting on 17 individual cases of COVID-19 induced SAT were identified. Age ranged from 18 to 69 years old. The majority of the cases were female (14 of 17, 82%). The delay between onset of respiratory symptoms and diagnosis of SAT ranged from 5 to 49 days (mean, 26.5). Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) related to viral infection was uncommonly reported at the time of SAT diagnosis. Thyroid ultrasonography frequently reported an enlarged hypoechoic thyroid with decreased vascularity and heterogenous echotexture. Elevated CRP was common at the time of SAT diagnosis, with results ranging from 4.5 to 176 mg/L (mean, 41 mg/L). Anti-thyroid antibodies were frequently negative. SAT specific treatment included corticosteroids for 12/17 (70.5%) patients. Most return to normal thyroid status. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 associated SAT may be difficult to identify in a timely manner due to potential absence of classic symptoms, as well as cross-over of common clinical features between COVID-19 and thyrotoxicosis.

The combined nasal and throat swab is used widely, but its diagnostic performance is uncertain. METHODS: In a prospective, multi-centre, cohort study conducted in secondary and tertiary care hospitals in Scotland, we evaluated the combined nasal and throat swab with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in consecutive patients admitted to hospital with suspected COVID-19. Diagnostic performance of the index and serial tests was evaluated for a primary outcome of confirmed or probable COVID-19, and a secondary outcome of confirmed COVID-19 on serial testing. The diagnosis was adjudicated by a panel, who recorded clinical, laboratory and radiological features blinded to the test results. RESULTS: We enrolled 1368 consecutive patients (median age 68 [interquartile range, IQR 53-80] years, 47% women) who underwent a total of 3822 tests (median 2 [IQR 1-3] tests per patient). The primary outcome occurred in 36% (496/1368), of whom 65% (323/496) and 35% (173/496) had confirmed and probable COVID-19, respectively. The index test was positive in 255/496 (51%) patients with the primary outcome, giving a sensitivity and specificity of 51.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] 48.8 to 54.1%) and 99.5% (95% CI 99.0 to 99.8%). Sensitivity increased in those undergoing 2, 3 or 4 tests to 60.1% (95% CI 56.7 to 63.4%), 68.3% (95% CI 64.0 to 72.3%) and 77.6% (95% CI 72.7 to 81.9%), respectively. The sensitivity of the index test was 78.9% (95% CI 74.4 to 83.2%) for the secondary outcome of confirmed COVID-19 on serial testing. CONCLUSIONS: In patients admitted to hospital, a single combined nasal and throat swab with RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 has excellent specificity, but limited diagnostic sensitivity for COVID-19. Diagnostic performance is significantly improved by repeated testing.","Lee, Kuan Ken; Doudesis, Dimitrios; Ross, Daniella A; Bularga, Anda; MacKintosh, Claire L; Koch, Oliver; Johannessen, Ingolfur; Templeton, Kate; Jenks, Sara; Chapman, Andrew R; Shah, Anoop S V; Anand, Atul; Perry, Meghan R; Mills, Nicholas L",BMC Infect Dis,,415

These complications may also worsen due to the potential compounding of COVID-19 related stigma with stigmatization associated with previously diagnosed conditions. This exploratory study analyzes the experiences of the stigma associated with COVID-19 lockdown in people with different previous diagnoses 2 and 5 weeks after the beginning of the state of emergency in Spain. Gender and age were controlled as covariables and 1,052 people participated in the study. The diagnosis groups were: Psychiatry and mental health (n = 71), Cardiovascular disease (n = 42), Neurological disease (n = 23), Lung disease (n = 53), and No diagnosis (n = 863). The instruments used to measure the stigma were the Intersectional Day-to-Day Discrimination Index and two items of the Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness scale. Analysis of covariance of repeated measures and analysis of variance, including Scheffe's post hoc test, were performed. We found significant differences in stigma among the first and second evaluation. Regarding the previous diagnosis, no differences were found at Time 1, but significant differences were found at Time 2, with those having a previous psychiatric or mental health diagnosis reporting higher levels of perceived discrimination and internalized stigmatization. Our results suggest that people with previous stigmatizing conditions might be more vulnerable to experiencing stigma in a confinement situation. In order to reduce the burden of the COVID-19 stigma, health interventions should also consider the resulting intersection of effects on internalized stigma and perceived discrimination.

The limitation of ICU beds has been one of the major burdens in the management around the world; therefore, clinical strategies to avoid ICU admission are needed. We aimed to describe the influence of tocilizumab on the need of transfer to ICU or death in non-critically ill patients. METHODS: A retrospective study of 171 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection that did not qualify as requiring transfer to ICU during the first 24h after admission to a conventional ward, were included. The criteria to receive tocilizumab was radiological impairment, oxygen demand or an increasing of inflammatory parameters, however, the ultimate decision was left to the attending physician judgement. The primary outcome was the need of ICU admission or death whichever came first. RESULTS: A total of 77 patients received tocilizumab and 94 did not. The tocilizumab group had less ICU admissions (10.3% vs. 27.6%, P=0.005) and need of invasive ventilation (0 vs 13.8%, P=0.001). In the multivariable analysis, tocilizumab remained as a protective variable (OR: 0.03, CI 95%: 0.007-0.1, P=0.0001) of ICU admission or death. CONCLUSIONS: Tocilizumab in early stages of the inflammatory flare could reduce an important number of ICU admissions and mechanical ventilation. The mortality rate of 10.3% among patients receiving tocilizumab appears to be lower than other reports.

522724,Health care workers protection during sars-cov-2 pandemic,2020,"Unemployment rates in the United States are rapidly increasing as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and attendant economic disruption. As employees lose their jobs, many will lose their employer-sponsored dental insurance (ESDI). Changes in insurance coverage are directly related to the oral health of the population, with many at risk of losing access to dental care. We assessed the impact of recent unemployment rates on insurance coverage and dental utilization. We estimated changes in dental insurance coverage at the state level, using previously applied econometric estimates. Expected changes in types of dental procedures performed at dental practices nationwide were assessed using a microsimulation model, using national practice survey data. Changes in emergency department (ED) visits for dental problems were estimated by fitting trendlines to ED visit patterns by payer type. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess how variations in unemployment rates and rates of ESDI in response to unemployment could alter the results. Since March 2020, the national unemployment rate has increased by 8.40 percentage points, an increase expected to result in more than 16 million individuals losing ESDI in the United States. Of these individuals, 45.0% are likely to enroll in their state's Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program, and 47.0% are expected to become uninsured. With these expected changes in dental insurance coverage, the average dental practice would experience decreases in routine checkup visits but increases in tooth extraction, a procedure that is highly used by publicly insured or uninsured patients. In addition, dental-related ED visits would be expected to grow by 4.0%. Losses of employment caused by the COVID-19 in the United States can have countervailing effects on people's health by impeding access to dental care. Lack of dental insurance is expected to be more pronounced in states that have not expanded Medicaid or do not provide Medicaid dental benefits for adults.","Choi, S E; Simon, L; Riedy, C A; Barrow, J R",J Dent Res,,415

DESIGN: Prospective cohort study; patients were enrolled between March 11, and April 29, 2020. The date of final follow-up was July 30, 2020. We used a propensity score matching approach to compare outcomes. Study outcomes were formulated before data collection and analysis. SETTING: Critical care units at two large metropolitan hospitals in New York City. PATIENTS: Five-hundred forty-one patients with confirmed severe coronavirus disease 2019 respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. INTERVENTIONS: Bedside percutaneous dilational tracheostomy with modified visualization and ventilation. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Required time for discontinuation off mechanical ventilation, total length of hospitalization, and overall patient survival. Of the 541 patients, 394 patients were eligible for a tracheostomy. One-hundred sixteen were early percutaneous dilational tracheostomies with median time of 9 days after initiation of mechanical ventilation (interquartile range, 7-12 d), whereas 89 were late percutaneous dilational tracheostomies with a median time of 19 days after initiation of mechanical ventilation (interquartile range, 16-24 d). Compared with patients with no tracheostomy, patients with an early percutaneous dilational tracheostomy had a higher probability of discontinuation from mechanical ventilation (absolute difference, 30%; p < 0.001; hazard ratio for successful discontinuation, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.34-5.84; p = 0.006) and a lower mortality (absolute difference, 34%, p < 0.001; hazard ratio for death, 0.11; 95% CI, 0.06-0.22; p < 0.001). Compared with patients with late percutaneous dilational tracheostomy, patients with early percutaneous dilational tracheostomy had higher discontinuation rates from mechanical ventilation (absolute difference 7%; p < 0.35; hazard ratio for successful discontinuation, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.01-2.3; p = 0.04) and had a shorter median duration of mechanical ventilation in survivors (absolute difference, -15 d; p < 0.001). None of the healthcare providers who performed all the percutaneous dilational tracheostomies procedures had clinical symptoms or any positive laboratory test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection.

589865,SARS-CoV-2 infection as a risk factor for herpesviridae reactivation: consider the potential influence of corticosteroid therapy,2020-10-22,"BACKGROUND: In order to perform a 3D reconstruction of electron microscopic images of viruses, it is necessary to determine the orientation (Euler angels) of the 2D projections of the virus. The projections containing high resolution information are usually very noisy. This paper proposes a new method, based on weighted-projection matching in wavelet space for virus orientation determination. In order to speed the retrieval of the best match between projections from a model and real virus particle, a hierarchical correlation matching method is also proposed. RESULTS: A data set of 600 HSV-1 capsid particle images in different orientations was used to test the proposed method. An initial model of about 40 Å resolutions was used to generate projections of an HSV-1 capsid. Results show that a significant improvement, in terms of accuracy and speed, is obtained for the initial orientation estimates of noisy herpes virus images. For the bacteriophage (P22), the proposed method gave the correct reconstruction compared to the model, while the classical method failed to resolve the correct orientations of the smooth spherical P22 viruses. CONCLUSION: This paper introduces a new method for orientation determination of low contrast images and highly noisy virus particles. This method is based on weighted projection matching in wavelet space, which increases the accuracy of the orientations. A hierarchical implementation of this method increases the speed of orientation determination. The estimated number of particles needed for a higher resolution reconstruction increased exponentially. For a 6 Å resolution reconstruction of the HSV virus, 50,000 particles are necessary. The results show that the proposed method reduces the amount of data needed in a reconstruction by at least 50 %.

590022,The correlation between SARS-CoV-2 infection and rheumatic disease,2020-05-01,"The Group IV viruses have a positive sense genome. Positive sense RNA can be translated directly into protein, without a DNA intermediate and without creating a complementary RNA strand. To replicate its genome, though, a complementary DNA strand is required. The positive RNA strand serves as a template for an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, yielding a complementary RNA strand, to form a dimer with the template strand. The double-stranded RNA subsequently serves as the template for a new positive sense genome. The positive strand RNA genome is independently infectious, for most Group IV viruses. This means that in the absence of a capsid, envelope, or enclosed proteins, the RNA molecule, when inserted into a cell, is capable of using host cell machinery to construct additional viruses. There are six subclasses of the Group IV single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses: Picornaviridae, Togaviridae, Coronaviridae, Hepeviridae, Caliciviridae, Flaviviridae, and Astroviridae. As expected, within each class, viruses share structural similarities; but there are no properties, other than the defining property of a (+)-sense single stranded RNA genome, that extends to all six classes of the Group IV viruses. For example, some classes have envelopes (i.e., Flaviviridae, Togaviridae, Coronaviridae), and others do not (i.e., Caliciviridae, Picornaviridae, Hepeviridae, and Astroviridae).

No effective vaccine or specific treatment for SFTS is currently available. Here, we used a mouse model to examine the effects of ribavirin, site-1 protease inhibitor PF-429242, steroids, and combination of minocycline and ciprofloxacin (MC) on SFTS infection. The antiserum from a patient who recovered from SFTS was also examined for its effect on mice. Administration of antiserum completely protected mice against lethal infection with SFTSV. It could also protect mice from showing clinical signs of the disease due to non-lethal infection. MC-treatment resulted in prolonged survival times during lethal infection. Although other agents had no significant protective effects, they did not provide detrimental effects that could lead to progression of the disease in mice. Our results suggest that antiserum treatment may be clinically useful for post-exposure prophylaxis against SFTSV infection.","Shimada, Satoshi; Posadas-Herrera, Guillermo; Aoki, Kotaro; Morita, Kouichi; Hayasaka, Daisuke",Virology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2015.03.010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25817401/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682215001464; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682215001464,415

Existing studies have found correlations between search data and HIV/AIDS epidemics. We aimed to extend the literature through exploring the feasibility of using search data to monitor and predict the number of newly diagnosed cases of HIV/AIDS, syphilis and gonorrhoea in China. METHODS: This paper used vector autoregressive model to combine the number of newly diagnosed cases with Baidu search index to predict monthly newly diagnosed cases of HIV/AIDS, syphilis and gonorrhoea in China. The procedures included: (1) keywords selection and filtering; (2) construction of composite search index; (3) modelling with training data from January 2011 to October 2016 and calculating the prediction performance with validation data from November 2016 to October 2017. RESULTS: The analysis showed that there was a close correlation between the monthly number of newly diagnosed cases and the composite search index (the Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients were 0.777 for HIV/AIDS, 0.590 for syphilis and 0.633 for gonorrhoea, p<0.05 for all). The R(2) were all more than 85% and the mean absolute percentage errors were less than 11%, showing the good fitting effect and prediction performance of vector autoregressive model in this field.

Here we combine single-molecule spectroscopy with all-atom simulations to uncover the molecular details that contribute to N protein function. N protein contains three dynamic disordered regions that house putative transiently-helical binding motifs. The two folded domains interact minimally such that full-length N protein is a flexible and multivalent RNA binding protein. N protein also undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation when mixed with RNA, and polymer theory predicts that the same multivalent interactions that drive phase separation also engender RNA compaction. We offer a simple symmetry-breaking model that provides a plausible route through which single-genome condensation preferentially occurs over phase separation, suggesting that phase separation offers a convenient macroscopic readout of a key nanoscopic interaction.","Cubuk, Jasmine; Alston, Jhullian J.; Incicco, J.

592196,Cutaneous Manifestations in SARS-CoV-2 Infection—A Series of Cases from the Largest Infectious Diseases Hospital in Western Romania,2021-06-25,"BACKGROUND: Diabetes has become one of the most prevalent chronic diseases, and many people living with diabetes use social media to seek health information. Recently, an emerging social media app, TikTok, has received much interest owing to its popularity among general health consumers. We notice that there are many videos about diabetes on TikTok. However, it remains unclear whether the information in these videos is of satisfactory quality. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the quality of the information in diabetes-related videos on TikTok. METHODS: We collected a sample of 199 diabetes-related videos in Chinese. The basic information presented in the videos was coded and analyzed. First, we identified the source of each video. Next, 2 independent raters assessed each video in terms of the completeness of six types of content (the definition of the disease, symptoms, risk factors, evaluation, management, and outcomes). Then, the 2 raters independently assessed the quality of information in the videos, using the DISCERN instrument. RESULTS: In regard to the sources of the videos, we found 6 distinct types of uploaders; these included 3 kinds of individual users (ie, health professionals, general users, and science communicators) and 3 types of organizational users (ie, news agencies, nonprofit organizations, and for-profit organizations). Regarding content, our results show that the videos were primarily about diabetes management and contained limited information on the definition of the disease, symptoms, risk factors, evaluation, and outcomes. The overall quality of the videos was acceptable, on average, although the quality of the information varied, depending on the sources. The videos created by nonprofit organizations had the highest information quality, while the videos contributed by for-profit organizations had the lowest information quality. CONCLUSIONS: Although the overall quality of the information in the diabetes videos on TikTok is acceptable, TikTok might not fully meet the health information needs of patients with diabetes, and they should exercise caution when using TikTok as a source of diabetes-related information.","Kong, Wenwen; Song, Shijie; Zhao, Yuxiang Chris; Zhu, Qinghua; Sha, Ling",J Med Internet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34468327/; https://doi.org/10.2196/30409,415

The current unprecedented Zika viral epidemics and rapid spread in the Western hemisphere pose a substantial global threat, with associated anxiety and consequences. The lack of safe and effective drugs and vaccines against Zika or dengue epidemics further buttresses the realization from the West Africa Ebola outbreak that most emerging disease-prone countries are still poorly prepared for an emergency response. This paper examines knowledge gaps in both emerging and neglected arthropod-borne flavivirus infectious diseases associated with poverty and their implications for fostering local, national and regional emerging disease preparedness, effective and robust surveillance–response systems, sustained control and eventual elimination.

More and more, we are able to evaluate side effects of the pandemic in the healthcare sector. A negative impact on cancer diagnoses is one of them. Careful observation of trends in an academic gyneco-oncological context appears important to identify potential negative developments. METHODS: We analyzed the case number of gynecologic and breast cancer diagnoses in the period from January to June 2020 compared to 2019 and during the period of the first general German lockdown (March 22nd until May 5th 2020). Patients were characterized by age, tumor type, FIGO or TNM stage and presence of symptoms at initial hospital presentation. RESULTS: The frequency of newly diagnosed gynecologic and breast cancer cases from beginning of January until end of June changed by − 10% and by − 12% during the lockdown in 2020 compared to 2019. In both periods, reduction of breast cancer cases was relatively larger than decrease of gynecologic cancers. Moreover, median patient age decreased. For the first half of 2020, we found a shift towards higher tumor stages (N+/M1 or FIGO III–IV). During the lockdown period, the appearance of tumor-associated symptoms at diagnosis increased by about 12%. CONCLUSION: This analysis illustrates the anticipated general decrease in diagnoses of primary cancers during the lockdown periods in 2020 due to COVID-19 pandemic for gynecologic and breast cancer cases.","Kaltofen, Till; Hagemann, Friederike; Harbeck, Nadia; Wuerstlein, Rachel; Kost, Bernd Peter; Burges, Alexander; Mahner, Sven; Trillsch, Fabian",Arch Gynecol Obstet,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00404-021-06211-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34491417/,415

The 21 patients tested had auto-Abs neutralizing IFN-α subtypes and/or IFN-ω; one had anti–IFN-β and another anti–IFN-ε, but none had anti–IFN-κ. Strikingly, 19 patients (86%) were hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia, including 15 (68%) admitted to an intensive care unit, 11 (50%) who required mechanical ventilation, and four (18%) who died. Ambulatory disease in three patients (14%) was possibly accounted for by prior or early specific interventions.

593664,Characteristics of the pediatric patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection in a Romanian children’s hospital: a retrospective study,2021-06-04,"BACKGROUND: The scale and quality of the global scientific response to the COVID-19 pandemic have unquestionably saved lives. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has also triggered an unprecedented “infodemic”; the velocity and volume of data production have overwhelmed many key stakeholders such as clinicians and policy makers, as they have been unable to process structured and unstructured data for evidence-based decision making. Solutions that aim to alleviate this data synthesis–related challenge are unable to capture heterogeneous web data in real time for the production of concomitant answers and are not based on the high-quality information in responses to a free-text query. OBJECTIVE: The main objective of this project is to build a generic, real-time, continuously updating curation platform that can support the data synthesis and analysis of a scientific literature framework. Our secondary objective is to validate this platform and the curation methodology for COVID-19–related medical literature by expanding the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset via the addition of new, unstructured data. METHODS: To create an infrastructure that addresses our objectives, the PanSurg Collaborative at Imperial College London has developed a unique data pipeline based on a web crawler extraction methodology. This data pipeline uses a novel curation methodology that adopts a human-in-the-loop approach for the characterization of quality, relevance, and key evidence across a range of scientific literature sources. RESULTS: REDASA (Realtime Data Synthesis and Analysis) is now one of the world’s largest and most up-to-date sources of COVID-19–related evidence; it consists of 104,000 documents. By capturing curators’ critical appraisal methodologies through the discrete labeling and rating of information, REDASA rapidly developed a foundational, pooled, data science data set of over 1400 articles in under 2 weeks. These articles provide COVID-19–related information and represent around 10% of all papers about COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: This data set can act as ground truth for the future implementation of a live, automated systematic review. The three benefits of REDASA’s design are as follows: (1) it adopts a user-friendly, human-in-the-loop methodology by embedding an efficient, user-friendly curation platform into a natural language processing search engine; (2) it provides a curated data set in the JavaScript Object Notation format for experienced academic reviewers’ critical appraisal choices and decision-making methodologies; and (3) due to the wide scope and depth of its web crawling method, REDASA has already captured one of the world’s largest COVID-19–related data corpora for searches and curation.","Vaghela, Uddhav; Rabinowicz, Simon; Bratsos, Paris; Martin, Guy; Fritzilas, Epameinondas; Markar, Sheraz; Purkayastha, Sanjay; Stringer, Karl; Singh, Harshdeep; Llewellyn, Charlie; Dutta, Debabrata; Clarke, Jonathan M; Howard, Matthew; Serban, Ovidiu; Kinross, James",J Med Internet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33835932/; https://doi.org/10.2196/25714,415

The Syrian hamster is an important model animal for infectious diseases, behavioral science and metabolic science, for which more experimental tools are becoming available. Here, we describe the generation and characterization of an interleukin-2 receptor subunit gamma (Il2rg) knockout (KO) Syrian hamster strain. In humans, mutations in IL2RG can result in a total failure of T and natural killer (NK) lymphocyte development and nonfunctional B lymphocytes (X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency; XSCID). Therefore, we sought to develop a non-murine model to study XSCID and the infectious diseases associated with IL2RG deficiency. We demonstrated that the Il2rg KO hamsters have a lymphoid compartment that is greatly reduced in size and diversity, and is impaired in function. As a result of the defective adaptive immune response, Il2rg KO hamsters developed a more severe human adenovirus infection and cleared virus less efficiently than immune competent wild-type hamsters. Because of this enhanced virus replication, Il2rg KO hamsters developed more severe adenovirus-induced liver pathology than wild-type hamsters. This novel hamster strain will provide researchers with a new tool to investigate human XSCID and its related infections.","Li, Rong; Ying, Baoling; Liu, Yanan; Spencer, Jacqueline F.; Miao, Jinxin; Tollefson, Ann E.; Brien, James D.; Wang, Yaohe; Wold, William S.

RESULTS: For the overall sample, the performance parameters of Ag-RDTs were as follows: Abbott assay, sensitivity 38.6% (95%CI 29.1–48.8) and specificity 99.5% (97–100%); Siemens, sensitivity 51.5% (41.3–61.6) and specificity 98.4% (95.3–99.6); Roche, sensitivity 43.6% (33.7–53.8) and specificity 96.2% (92.4–98.5); Lepu, sensitivity 45.5% (35.6–55.8) and specificity 89.2% (83.8–93.3%); Surescreen, sensitivity 28.8% (20.2–38.6) and specificity 97.8% (94.5–99.4%). For specimens with cycle threshold (Ct) <30 in RT-qPCR, all Ag-RDT achieved a sensitivity ≥70%. The modelled negative- and positive-predictive value for 1% prevalence were >99% and <50%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: When screening unexposed asymptomatic individuals, two Ag-RDTs achieved sensitivity ≥80% for specimens with Ct<30 and specificity ≥96%.

Evidence suggests that video consulting is acceptable, safe, and effective in selected conditions and settings. However, research to date has mostly focused on initial adoption, with limited consideration of how video consulting can be mainstreamed and sustained. OBJECTIVE: This study sought to do the following: (1) review and synthesize reported opportunities, challenges, and lessons learned in the scale-up, spread, and sustainability of video consultations, and (2) identify transferable insights that can inform policy and practice. METHODS: We identified papers through systematic searches in PubMed, CINAHL, and Web of Science. Included articles reported on synchronous, video-based consultations that had spread to more than one setting beyond an initial pilot or feasibility stage, and were published since 2010. We used the Nonadoption, Abandonment, and challenges to the Scale-up, Spread, and Sustainability (NASSS) framework to synthesize findings relating to 7 domains: an understanding of the health condition(s) for which video consultations were being used, the material properties of the technological platform and relevant peripherals, the value proposition for patients and developers, the role of the adopter system, organizational factors, wider macro-level considerations, and emergence over time. RESULTS: We identified 13 papers describing 10 different video consultation services in 6 regions, covering the following: (1) video-to-home services, connecting providers directly to the patient; (2) hub-and-spoke models, connecting a provider at a central hub to a patient at a rural center; and (3) large-scale top-down evaluations scaled up or spread across a national health administration. Services covered rehabilitation, geriatrics, cancer surgery, diabetes, and mental health, as well as general specialist care and primary care. Potential enablers of spread and scale-up included embedded leadership and the presence of a telehealth champion, appropriate reimbursement mechanisms, user-friendly technology, pre-existing staff relationships, and adaptation (of technology and services) over time. Challenges tended to be related to service development, such as the absence of a long-term strategic plan, resistance to change, cost and reimbursement issues, and the technical experience of staff. There was limited articulation of the challenges to scale-up and spread of video consultations. This was combined with a lack of theorization, with papers tending to view spread and scale-up as the sum of multiple technical implementations, rather than theorizing the distinct processes required to achieve widespread adoption. CONCLUSIONS: There remains a significant lack of evidence that can support the spread and scale-up of video consulting. Given the recent pace of change due to COVID-19, a more definitive evidence base is urgently needed to support global efforts and match enthusiasm for extending use.","James, Hannah M; Papoutsi, Chrysanthi; Wherton, Joseph; Greenhalgh, Trisha; Shaw, Sara E",J Med Internet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33434141/; https://doi.org/10.2196/23775,415
597340,Differential occupational risks to healthcare workers from SARS-CoV-2 observed during a prospective observational study,2020-08-21,"Background As the rate of COVID-19 infections grew in Kisoro, Uganda, fear and misinformation about the virus were rife. Accurate, trustworthy community education seemed essential to support prevention efforts in the villages, allay widespread fear of death, and avoid the overwhelming of Kisoro District Hospital (KDH). Since 2005, KDH has collaborated with an NGO, Doctors for Global Health (DGH) and the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, NY, USA, to sponsor a robust Village Health Worker (VHW) programme in 52 villages in the Kisoro district. Community health education has been a cornerstone of the programme since its inception, and VHW-delivered home talks with portable, pictorial flip charts have shown success as a model for health education. Here, we describe a COVID-19 home-talk programme developed in a short time in response the COVID-19 pandemic and evaluate learning from this programme compared with learning from local radio (the main channel of information) and other regional information sources. In a COVID-19 lockdown, would the home-visit model be applicable? Would a health-worker delivered home-talk programme add to learning otherwise garnered from radio, television or neighbours? Methods We developed a 30 min COVID-19 home talk in 10 days; we trained 48 VHWs in an intense 2-day training, then monitored and certified VHW's skills over three sessions of field observation. Home talks were then fully implemented with a maximum of four adults per talk and social distancing was observed. To measure the retained learning from home talks, one adult per talk answered a six-item pre-test, and 3–5 weeks later, we randomly selected 20% of these participants and invited them to complete an identical post-test. To control for media exposure and assess contamination of the talk messages over time in study villages, residents of non-participating villages also completed tests at the same time that study participants completed post-tests in participating villages. Findings In the 3 months between April 20, 2020, and June 16, 2020, 48 VHWs gave 4308 COVID-19 home talks to more than 14 000 adults who have minimal education. Participants' post-test scores were 20% higher than pre-test scores and 30% higher than controls' test scores (p<0·0001) and were independent of the VHW's presentation skills. Significant learning was seen surrounding COVID-19 symptoms, mechanisms of spread, disease prevention, and risks of mortality, but not about when to go to the hospital with symptoms. Most participants (82%) reported understanding and valuing information from the COVID-19 home talks more than they did information heard via the radio. Interpretation Despite ubiquitous coverage of COVID-19 issues in the popular media, small group home talks by VHWs were preferred by rural villagers in Uganda and resulted in new, retained learning. We believe that this preference was probably the result of trust in the VHW and the opportunity to focus and ask questions. Corollary learning by word of mouth also occurred in home talk villages.

Social media have the potential to be one of the most effective tools for mental health campaigns, reaching wide audiences in the shortest amount of time. In this paper, the potential of harnessing social media platforms to address mental health needs in underserved populations is presented. In addition, description of the preliminary implementation of a social media mental health campaign, the 5 × 5 campaign, is described as an example of the feasibility and benefits of such efforts. Key implications gleaned from the implementation process are also presented. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Utilizing a participatory approach, the 5 × 5 campaign aimed to improve recognition of mental health symptoms, promote help seeking, and provide immediate strategies for self-care for individuals experiencing psychological distress related to the COVID-19 pandemic in low-income, high-risk communities in and around Guatemala City. Campaign content was promoted on Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp from April 2020 to June 2020. RESULTS: Preliminary analysis of the 5 × 5 campaign demonstrated feasibility and substantial impact with over 84,000 individuals reached by the campaigns through initial messaging and shares. CONCLUSION: The 5 × 5 highlights the feasibility of using social media campaigns for mental health promotion and key factors that should be incorporated in the planning of social media mental health campaigns aimed at promoting awareness, engaging underserved communities, and encouraging help seeking.","Alonzo, Dana; Popescu, Marciana",J Educ Health Promot,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34222531/; https://doi.org/10.4103/jehp.jehp_21_21,415
598524,Granuloma annulare triggered by SARS‐CoV‐2 infection: Immunohistochemical staining,2021-03-03,"Background: The general medical impacts of coronavirus (COVID-19) are increasingly appreciated. However, its impact on neurocognitive, psychiatric health and quality of life (QoL) in survivors after the acute phase is poorly understood. We aimed to evaluate neurocognitive function, psychiatric symptoms, and QoL in COVID-19 survivors shortly after hospital discharge. Methods: This was a cross-sectional analysis of a prospective study of hospitalized COVID-19 survivors followed-up for 2 months after discharge. A battery of standardized instruments evaluating neurocognitive function, psychiatric morbidity, and QoL (mental and physical components) was administered by telephone. Findings: Of the 229 screened patients, 179 were included in the final analysis. Among survivors, the prevalence of moderately impaired immediate verbal memory and learning was 38%, delayed verbal memory (11.8%), verbal fluency (34.6%), and working memory (executive function) (6.1%), respectively. Moreover, 58.7% of patients had neurocognitive impairment in at least one function. Rates of positive screening for anxiety were 29.6%, depression (26.8%), and post-traumatic stress disorder (25.1%) respectively. In addition, 39.1% of the patients had psychiatric morbidity. Low QoL for physical and mental components was detected in 44.1% and 39.1% of patients, respectively. Delirium and stress-related symptoms increased approximately 4-fold the odds of developing neurocognitive impairment. Female gender and neurocognitive impairment diagnosis were related with an increase of 2.5 and 4.56-fold odds respectively of psychiatric morbidity. Interpretation: Hospitalized COVID-19 survivors showed a high prevalence of neurocognitive impairment, psychiatric morbidity, and poor QoL in the short-term. It is uncertain if these impacts persist over the long-term.","Mendez, R.; Balanza-Martinez, V.; Luperdi, S.

We highlight large differences in the socioeconomic impact of these two outbreaks. The data come from a phone survey that we conducted in the period May-July 2020 with 637 households and 363 small firms from a megacity and two rural communes in the province of North Kivu. While 3,470 EVD cases and 2,287 EVD deaths were confirmed since August 2018, self-reported impacts of EVD on revenues, access to food and behavior were limited. In contrast, only 251 Covid-19 cases were reported as of July 22nd but respondents reported sizable effects on livelihoods, especially in the large urban hub, and in part driven by substantial job losses. Our results show that different infectious disease outbreaks can have very different effects, largely unrelated to case numbers of the disease. Moderately lethal but highly transmissible viruses such as Covid-19 can trigger a steep economic downturn, especially in areas with high economic interconnectedness, reflecting both national and international policies to contain the pandemic.","Stoop, Nik; Desbureaux, Sébastien; Kaota, Audacieux; Lunanga, Elie; Verpoorten, Marijke",World Dev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34548742/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X20304800; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.worlddev.2020.105352; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0305750X20304800,415

This posed challenges to many countries, prominent among which is communication with the public to gain their cooperation. Israel faces different challenges from other countries in its management of the COVID-19 crisis because it is in the midst of a deep constitutional crisis. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper was to examine the response of the Israeli public to the government’s emergency instructions regarding the pandemic in terms of correlations between overall risk perception and crisis management; overall risk perception and economic threat perception; crisis management and compliance with behavioral guidelines; and crisis management and economic threat perception. We also made comparisons between crisis management and spokesperson credibility and between crisis management and the credibility of information sources. METHODS: The sample was established using an online survey that enabled rapid and effective distribution of an online questionnaire during the COVID-19 crisis. The self-selection online survey method of nonprobability sampling was used to recruit participants (N=1056) through social network posts asking the general public (aged ≥18 years) to answer the survey. RESULTS: Participants aged ≥65 years perceived higher personal risk compared to those aged 18-30 years (mean difference 0.33, 95% CI 0.04-0.61) and those aged 46-64 years (mean difference 0.38, 95% CI 0.12-0.64). Significant correlations were found between overall risk perception and attitudes toward crisis management (r=0.19, P<.001), overall risk perception and economic threat perception (r=0.22, P<.001), attitudes toward crisis management and compliance with behavioral guidelines (r=0.15, P<.001), and attitudes toward crisis management and economic threat perception (r=–0.15, P<.001). Participants who perceived that the prime minister was the most credible spokesperson evaluated the crisis management significantly higher than all other groups. The crisis management was evaluated significantly lower by participants who stated that infectious disease specialists were the most credible spokespersons. Participants for whom the Ministry of Health website was the most credible source of information evaluated the crisis management higher than all other groups. Participants for whom scientific articles were the most credible source of information evaluated the crisis management lower than those who perceived that the WHO/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention websites or Ministry of Health/hospital websites and health care workers were the most credible. CONCLUSIONS: The higher the public trust and evaluation of crisis management, the greater the compliance of the public with guidelines. It was also found that crisis management and information cannot be approached in the same way for the overall public. Furthermore, unlike other epidemics, the COVID-19 crisis has widespread economic and social consequences; therefore, it is impossible to focus only on health risks without communicating economic and social risks as well.","Gesser-Edelsburg, Anat; Cohen, Ricky; Hijazi, Rana; Abed Elhadi Shahbari, Nour",J Med Internet Res,https://doi.org/10.2196/19370; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32392172/,415

METHODS: We included 44,639 and 411,976 adult patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes alive on Jan 1, 2020, and compared them to controls matched for age, sex, and county of residence (n=204,919 and 1,948,900). Age- and sex-standardized rates for COVID-19 related hospitalizations, admissions to intensive care and death, were estimated and hazard ratios were calculated using Cox regression analyses. FINDINGS: There were 10,486 hospitalizations and 1,416 admissions into intensive care. A total of 1,175 patients with diabetes and 1,820 matched controls died from COVID-19, of these 53•2% had been hospitalized and 10•7% had been in intensive care. Patients with type 2 diabetes, compared to controls, displayed an age- and sex-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 2•22, 95%CI 2•13-2•32) of being hospitalized for COVID-19, which decreased to HR 1•40, 95%CI 1•34-1•47) after further adjustment for sociodemographic factors, pharmacological treatment and comorbidities, had higher risk for admission to ICU due to COVID-19 (age- and sex-adjusted HR 2•49, 95%CI 2•22-2•79, decreasing to 1•42, 95%CI 1•25-1•62 after adjustment, and increased risk for death due to COVID-19 (age- and sex-adjusted HR 2•19, 95%CI 2•03-2•36, complete adjustment 1•50, 95%CI 1•39-1•63). Age- and sex-adjusted HR for COVID-19 hospitalization for type 1 diabetes was 2•10, 95%CI 1•72-2•57), decreasing to 1•25, 95%CI 0•3097-1•62) after adjustment• Patients with diabetes type 1 were twice as likely to require intensive care for COVID-19, however, not after adjustment (HR 1•49, 95%CI 0•75-2•92), and more likely to die (HR 2•90, 95% CI 1•6554-5•47) from COVID-19, but not independently of other factors (HR 1•38, 95% CI 0•64-2•99). Among patients with diabetes, elevated glycated hemoglobin levels were associated with higher risk for most outcomes. INTERPRETATION: In this nationwide study, type 2 diabetes was independently associated with increased risk of hospitalization, admission to intensive care and death for COVID-19. There were few admissions into intensive care and deaths in type 1 diabetes, and although hazards were significantly raised for all three outcomes, there was no independent risk persisting after adjustment for confounding factors.","Rawshani, Aidin; Kjölhede, Elin Allansson; Rawshani, Araz; Sattar, Naveed; Eeg-Olofsson, Katarina; Adiels, Martin; Ludvigsson, Johnny; Lindh, Marcus; Gisslén, Magnus; Hagberg, Eva; Lappas, Georgios; Eliasson, Björn; Rosengren, Annika",Lancet Reg Health Eur,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lanepe.2021.100105; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S266677622100082X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33969336/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S266677622100082X,415

METHODS: An online survey, containing 31 questions, was conducted among medical doctors using a secure Google forms link. The survey was open for 48 hours from 16(th)-18(th) April 2020. RESULTS: Responses were received from 556 physicians (including 266 ophthalmologists). About a third (n = 205) wanted to start OP immediately after lockdown. In OP, mask of any kind for patient (60.8%), 3-ply for assistants (52.7%) and N95 for doctors (72.7%) were most common preferences. In OP, 31.5% and 46.6% felt full PPE and gloves alone were sufficient respectively. Ophthalmologists were more likely to start immediately after lockdown compared to other specialists (P = 0.004). Among 299 surgeons, an almost equal number (27%) wanted to start routine OT services immediately and 2 weeks post lockdown. A large majority (76.9%) would mandate COVID-19 tests before elective surgeries. In OT, 34.1% wanted N95 for surgical team and 3-ply for patient, 23.4% wanted 3-ply masks for everyone. 40.5% felt additional personal protective equipment (PPE) is not required and 33.1% felt that full PPE is required for everyone in OT. Ophthalmic surgeons preferred 3-ply masks and were less inclined to use full PPE (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Perspectives of doctors vary, especially with regarding to timing of restarting services and precautions to be taken in the OT.

We also analyze structures for glycoforms representing those present in the nascent glycoproteins (prior to enzymatic modifications in the Golgi), as well as those that are commonly observed on antigens present in other viruses. These models were subjected to molecular dynamics (MD) simulation to determine the extent to which glycan microheterogeneity impacts the antigenicity of the S glycoprotein. Lastly, we have identified peptides in the S glycoprotein that are likely to be presented in human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complexes, and discuss the role of S protein glycosylation in potentially modulating the innate and adaptive immune response to the SARS-CoV-2 virus or to a related vaccine. The 3D structures show that the protein surface is extensively shielded from antibody recognition by glycans, with the notable exception of the ACE2 receptor binding domain, and also that the degree of shielding is largely insensitive to the specific glycoform. Despite the relatively modest contribution of the glycans to the total molecular weight of the S trimer (17% for the HEK293 glycoform) they shield approximately 40% of the protein surface.","Grant, Oliver C.; Montgomery, David; Ito, Keigo; Woods, Robert J.",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32929138/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-71748-7,415

Monitoring respiratory rate (RR) under non-contact is particularly important for providing appropriate pre-hospital care in emergencies. We propose an RR estimation system using thermal imaging cameras, which are increasingly being used in the medical field, such as recently during the COVID-19 pandemic. By measuring temperature changes during exhalation and inhalation, we aim to track the respiration of the subject in a supine or seated position in real-time without any physical contact. The proposed method automatically selects the respiration-related regions from the detected facial regions and estimates the respiration rate. Most existing methods rely on signals from nostrils and require close-up or high-resolution images, while our method only requires the facial region to be captured. Facial region is detected using YOLO v3, an object detection model based on deep learning. The detected facial region is divided into subregions. By calculating the respiratory likelihood of each segmented region using the newly proposed index, called the Respiratory Quality Index, the respiratory region is automatically selected and the RR is estimated. An evaluation of the proposed RR estimation method was conducted on seven subjects in their early twenties, with four 15 s measurements being taken. The results showed a mean absolute error of 0.66 bpm. The proposed method can be useful as an RR estimation method.","Takahashi, Yudai; Gu, Yi; Nakada, Takaaki; Abe, Ryuzo; Nakaguchi, Toshiya",Sensors (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/s21134406; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34199084/,415

These outbreaks normally result in overstretching of health facilities as well as death in children under the age of five. Most of these infections are usually self-limiting except for the neurological complications associated with human enterovirus A 71 (EV-A71). The infection dynamics of these viruses have not been fully understood, with most inferences made from previous studies conducted with poliovirus. Non-poliovirus enteroviral infections are responsible for major outbreaks of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) often associated with neurological complications and severe respiratory diseases. The myriad of disease presentations observed so far in children calls for an urgent need to fully elucidate the replication processes of these viruses. There are concerted efforts from different research groups to fully map out the role of human host factors in the replication cycle of these viral infections. Understanding the interaction between viral proteins and human host factors will unravel important insights on the lifecycle of this groups of viruses. This review provides the latest update on the interplay between human host factors/processes and non-polio enteroviruses (NPEV). We focus on the interactions involved in viral attachment, entry, internalization, uncoating, replication, virion assembly and eventual egress of the NPEV from the infected cells. We emphasize on the virus- human host interplay and highlight existing knowledge gaps that needs further studies. Understanding the NPEV-human host factors interactions will be key in the design and development of vaccines as well as antivirals against enteroviral infections. Dissecting the role of human host factors during NPEV infection cycle will provide a clear picture of how NPEVs usurp the human cellular processes to establish an efficient infection.

Mucosal immunity is the first barrier to pathogens' entry into the body. Immunoglobulin A (IgA) is the main antibody of mucosal immunity. We explored the relationship between selective immunoglobulin A deficiency (SIgAD) and the severity of COVID-19. We included 424 patients (203 females) with COVID-19. Eleven patients had SIgAD. Laboratory data on patients with SIgAD and normal IgA levels were compared. The relationship between SIgAD and severe COVID-19 infection was explored by logistic regression analysis. In univariate logistic regression analysis, the risk of severe disease in COVID-19 patients with SIgAD was approximately 7.7-fold higher than in the other patients (odds ratio [OR], 7.789; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.665-36.690, p = 0.008), while it was 4-fold (OR, 4.053; 95% CI, 1.182-13.903, p = 0.026) higher in multivariate logistic regression analysis. Serum IgA levels were positively correlated with total lymphocyte counts, and negatively correlated with C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, which were found as a risk factor for severe COVID-19.In SIgAD patients, the number of SARS-CoV-2 viruses that pass through mucosal membranes may be increased, leading to complications such as cytokine storm syndrome and acute respiratory distress syndrome.","Çölkesen, Fatih; Kandemir, Bahar; Arslan, Şevket; Çölkesen, Fatma; Yıldız, Eray; Korkmaz, Celalettin; Vatansev, Hülya; Evcen, Recep; Sadi Aykan, Filiz; Kılınç, Mehmet; Aytekin, Gökhan; Feyzioğlu, Bahadır; Doğan, Metin; Teke, Turgut",Japanese journal of infectious diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34588364/; https://doi.org/10.7883/yoken.jjid.2021.281,415
606066,"Original antigenic sin responses to heterologous Betacoronavirus spike proteins are observed in mice following intramuscular administration, but are not apparent in children following SARS-CoV-2 infection",2021-04-30,"The novel β-coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has infected more than 101 million people and resulted in 2.2 million death worldwide. Recent epidemiological studies suggested that some environmental factors, such as air pollution, might be the important contributors to the mortality of COVID-19. However, how environmental exposure enhances the severity of COVID-19 remains to be fully understood. In the present report, we provide evidence showing that mdig, a previously reported environmentally-induced oncogene that antagonizes repressive trimethylation of histone proteins, is a master regulator for SARS-CoV-2 receptors neuropilin-1 (NRP1) and NRP2, cathepsins, glycan metabolism and inflammation, key determinants for viral infection and cytokine storm of the patients. Depletion of mdig in bronchial epithelial cells by CRISPR-Cas-9 gene editing resulted in a decreased expression of NRP1, NRP2, cathepsins, and genes involved in protein glycosylation and inflammation, largely due to a substantial enrichment of lysine 9 and/or lysine 27 trimethylation of histone H3 (H3K9me3/H3K27me3) on these genes as determined by ChIP-seq. These data, accordingly, suggest that mdig is a key mediator for the severity of COVID-19 in response to environmental exposure and targeting mdig may be one of the effective strategies in ameliorating the symptom and reducing the mortality of COVID-19.","Zhang, Qian; Thakur, Chitra; Fu, Yao; Bi, Zhuoyue; Qiu, Yiran; Wadgaonkar, Priya; Xu, Liping; Almutairy, Bandar; Zhang, Wenxuan; Stemmer, Paul; Chen, Fei",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.31.429010,415

606292,Unravelling the epidemiology and clinical impact of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in neonates,2021-05-29,"BACKGROUND: Former studies on work-related upper limb disorders (WRULD) within university education report substantial prevalence rates. In this study, developments in WRULD amongst students in the period 2004-2014 were investigated. Our findings can be a benchmark for future studies, in particular when there are major societal changes as in the case of the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: Differences in time (academic year), how long students have been studying (year of studying), relations with computer time and societal changes were points of interest. METHODS: 2254 students (average age 20.0 years) responded to a questionnaire on WRULD. Students experiencing complaints were further questioned about the severity of complaints and associated body locations. RESULTS: The average percentage of students experiencing complaints was 57%. The highest prevalence rates and severity scores were found in the first and last recorded academic years. The neck, shoulder, back and wrist were most often indicated. The prevalence of complaints raised from the 1st (49%) to the 4th (75%) year of studying. Two seriousness measures showed highest scores in the 5th/6th/7th year of studying. Relations were found between both the prevalence and seriousness of complaints with reported computer time. CONCLUSIONS: After an initial decreasing trend from the academic year 2006/2007 to 2010/2011 there was an increase in WRULD amongst students from 2010/2011 to 2013/2014. Limiting financial and study time factors may have played a role. Structural attention for WRULD prevention and risk factors seems to be effective in reducing prevalence and severity of WRULD. This seems to be even more necessary due to recent COVID-related changes in the students' lives.","Dekker, Marijke C; van Egmond, René; Molenbroek, Johan F M; Vink, Peter",Work,https://doi.org/10.3233/wor-213484; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34092687/,415

This article describes the implementation of centralized nationwide mailed HIV/STI home testing (CareKit). METHODS: The Emory Center for AIDS Research developed CareKit for research study participants to request HIV self-test kits, STI specimen collection kits, and condom/lubricant packs to be shipped to any mailing address in the United States. Sexually transmitted infection kits were customized according to study needs and could include materials to collect whole blood, dried blood spots, urine sample, and rectal and pharyngeal swab samples for syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia testing. Specimens were mailed back to a central Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments–approved laboratory for testing, and results were returned to participants. RESULTS: CareKit was used by 12 MSM studies and mailed 1132 STI kits to 775 participants between January 2018 and March 2020. Participants returned 507 (45%) STI kits, which included 1594 individual specimens. Eighty-one kits (16%) had at least one positive STI test result: pharyngeal chlamydia (n = 7), pharyngeal gonorrhea (n = 11), rectal chlamydia (n = 15), rectal gonorrhea (n = 12), genital chlamydia (n = 6), genital gonorrhea (n = 1), and syphilis (n = 54). In this same 2-year period, 741 HIV self-test kits were mailed to 643 MSM. CONCLUSIONS: CareKit successfully met studies' needs for home HIV/STI testing and diagnosed many STIs. These processes continue to be adapted for research and programs. The ability to mail home test kits has become increasingly important to reach those who may have limited access to health care services, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Norelli, Jenna; Zlotorzynska, Maria; Sanchez, Travis; Sullivan, Patrick S.",Sex Transm Dis,https://doi.org/10.1097/olq.0000000000001473; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34030160/,415

It is not possible to conclude the role of the environment in transmission of SARS-CoV-2 without studying areas in which people transit in great numbers. In this work we aimed to better understand the role of environment in the spread of COVID-19. We investigated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in fomites as well as in the air and in the sewage using RT-qPCR. We studied both, a reference market area and a COVID-19 reference hospital at Barreiras city, Brazil. We collected and analyzed a total of 418 samples from mask fronts, cell phones, paper money, card machines, sewage, air and bedding during the ascendant phase of the epidemiological curve of COVID-19 in Barreiras. As a result, we detected the human RNAse P gene in most of samples, which indicates the presence of human cells or their fragments in specimens. However, we did not detect any trace of SARS-CoV-2 in all samples analyzed. We conclude that, so far, the environment and inanimate materials did not have an important role in COVID-19 transmission in Barreiras city. Therefore, similar results can probably be found in other cities, mainly those with COVID-19 epidemiological scenarios similar to that of Barreiras city. Our study is a small piece indicating the possibility that fomites and the environment do not have an important role in COVID-19 transmission. However, further studies are necessary to better understand the world scenario.","Rocha, Ana Luíza Silva; Pinheiro, Josilene Ramos; Nakamura, Thamilin Costa; da Silva, José Domingos Santos; Rocha, Beatriz Gonçalves Silva; Klein, Raphael Contelli; Birbrair, Alexander; Amorim, Jaime Henrique",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34354189/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-95479-5,415

Here we report a case of cold agglutinin disease (CAD), autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA), and pulmonary embolism as a presentation of COVID-19 infection. CASE REPORT: A 51-year-old African–American woman presented to the emergency room with fever and shortness of breath. She was tachycardic, febrile, and had an oxygen saturation of 88% on room air. Laboratory studies showed hemoglobin (Hb) 5.1 g/dL, D-dimer 4.55 µg/mL, and C-reactive protein 12.3 mg/dL. Computed tomography scan of the chest showed acute pulmonary embolism involving the bilateral lower lobe segmental branches. Her influenza test was negative, but her SARS-CoV-2 test returned positive. Due to severe anemia, she was not started on any anticoagulation. Haptoglobin was low. Direct antiglobulin test returned positive for anticomplement and negative for anti-immunoglobulin G. Cold agglutinin titer was 80. Mycoplasma, Epstein–Barr virus, parvovirus, human immunodeficiency viruses, and acute hepatitis screen were negative. Abdominal and pelvic computed tomography showed a normal liver and spleen without lymphadenopathy. Peripheral blood smear showed red blood cell agglutination. On Day 2, she became hypoxic requiring 6 L oxygen. Since her Hb remained stable, she was started on low-intensity unfractionated heparin. Inflammatory markers subsequently improved and she was weaned off oxygen. Her Hb remained stable at 9 g/dL and she was discharged home. After 2 weeks, her Hb increased to 11 g/dL. CONCLUSION: As exemplified in this case report, COVID-19 infection can lead to thromboembolism, CAD, and AIHA and it should be recognized as a potential etiology to such rare diseases.","Patil, Neha R.; Herc, Erica S.; Girgis, Marian",Hematol Oncol Stem Cell Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32645300/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1658387620301163; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1658387620301163; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hemonc.2020.06.005,415

Hematologists are confident with these situations requiring a prompt therapeutic approach for switching off the uncontrolled cytokine release; here, we discuss pros and cons of drugs that are already employed in hematology in the light of their possible application in COVID-19. The most promising drugs might be: Ruxolitinib, a JAK1/2 inhibitor, with a rapid and powerful anti-cytokine effect, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), with their good anti-inflammatory properties, and perhaps the anti-Cd26 antibody Begelomab. We also present immunological data from gene expression experiments where TKIs resulted effective anti-inflammatory and pro-immune drugs.

OBJECTIVE: To describe clinical outcomes and risk factors for transmission in neonates born to mothers with perinatal SARS-CoV-2 infection. DESIGN: Prospective cohort of suspected and confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infected neonates entered in National Neonatology Forum (NNF) of India registry. SUBJECTS: Neonates born to women with SARS-CoV-2 infection within two weeks before or two days after birth and neonates with SARS-CoV-2 infection. OUTCOMES: Incidence and risk factors of perinatal transmission. RESULTS: Among 1713 neonates, SARS-CoV-2 infection status was available for 1330 intramural and 104 extramural neonates. SARS-CoV-2 positivity was reported in 144 intramural and 39 extramural neonates. Perinatal transmission occurred in 106 (8%) and horizontal transmission in 21 (1.5%) intramural neonates. Neonates roomed-in with mother had higher transmission risk (RR1.16, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.4; P=0.01). No association was noted with the mode of delivery or type of feeding. The majority of neonates positive for SARS-CoV2 were asymptomatic. Intramural SARS-CoV-2 positive neonates were more likely to be symptomatic (RR 5, 95%CI 3.3 to 7.7; P<0.0001) and need resuscitation (RR 2, 95%CI 1.0 to 3.9; P=0.05) compared to SARS-CoV-2 negative neonates.

In this study, Mycobacterium smegmatis is used as a model airborne bacteria, and different amounts of soot particles are employed as model air pollutants. The toxic effects of soot on aerosolized M. smegmatis are first evaluated and excluded by introducing them separately into a chamber, being sampled on a filter, and then cultured and counted. Secondly, the bacteria–soot mixture is exposed to UV with different durations and then cultured for bacterial viability evaluations. The results show that under UV exposure, the survival rates of the low-, medium-, and high-soot groups are 1.1 (±0.8) %, 70.9 (±4.3) %, and 61.0 (±17.6) %, respectively. This evidence significantly enhanced survival rates by soot at all UV exposures, though the combinations of UV exposure and soot amounts revealed a changing pattern of survival rates. The possible influence by direct and indirect effects of UV-damaging mechanisms is proposed. This study indicates the soot-induced survival rate enhancements of M. smegmatis under UV stress conditions, representing the possible relations between air pollution and the extended pathogenic viability and, therefore, increased airborne infection probability.","Noda, J.; Tomizawa, S.; Takahashi, K.; Morimoto, K.; Mitarai, S.",Int J Environ Sci Technol (Tehran),https://doi.org/10.1007/s13762-021-03203-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33643419/,415

Mice immunized with NZ9000-pNZ8148-SPVP1 produced high levels of mucosal secretory IgA (sIgA), antigen-specific serum IgG, IgA, and neutralizing antibodies, and developed stronger cell-mediated immune reactions and significant T spleen lymphocyte proliferation. Furthermore, the recombinant group generated much higher levels of IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10 than the other groups. CONCLUSIONS: Potent immune responses were successfully elicited in mice with FMDV VP1 delivered through L. lactis.","Liu, Xinsheng; Qi, Linlin; Lv, Jianliang; Zhang, Zhongwang; Zhou, Peng; Ma, Zhongyuan; Wang, Yonglu; Zhang, Yongguang; Pan, Li",Biotechnol Lett,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32385744/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10529-020-02900-6,415
610996,Defining the role of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 transmission – a living systematic review,2021-01-21,"INTRODUCTION: Mass gatherings (MG) may provide ideal conditions for influenza transmission. The evidence for an association between MG and influenza transmission is reviewed to assess whether restricting MG may reduce transmission. METHODS: Major databases were searched (Pubmed, EMBASE, Scopus, CINAHL), producing 1706 articles that were sifted by title, abstract, and full-text. A narrative approach was adopted for data synthesis. RESULTS: Twenty-four papers met the inclusion criteria, covering MG of varying sizes and settings, and including 9 observational studies, 10 outbreak reports, 4 event reports, and a quasi-experimental study. There is some evidence that certain types of MG may be associated with increased risk of influenza transmission. MG may also “seed” new strains into an area, and may instigate community transmission in a pandemic. Restricting MGs, in combination with other social distancing interventions, may help reduce transmission, but it was not possible to identify conclusive evidence on the individual effect of MG restriction alone. Evidence suggests that event duration and crowdedness may be the key factors that determine the risk of influenza transmission, and possibly the type of venue (indoor/outdoor). CONCLUSION: These factors potentially represent a basis for a policy-making framework for MG restrictions in the event of a severe pandemic.","Ishola, David A.; Phin, Nick",J Epidemiol Glob Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23856374/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jegh.2011.06.004; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2210600611000062; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210600611000062,415

In the context of the current COVID 19 pandemic, this could be one of the red flags for the dental practitioner in terms of screening potential COVID 19 patients. Methods The authors searched electronic databases with regards to anosmia/hyposmia and their relation to local and systemic causes. Results The authors found articles relating to the physiology and significance of normal olfaction, etiology, and pathophysiology of olfaction and disorders of the same. Also, we found the most recent literature of anosmia/hyposmia linked to early symptoms of this pandemic. Conclusions Anosmia/hyposmia is most likely indicative of a local or systemic pathology affecting the olfactory system. Recent evidence suggests the importance of this as related to the new global pandemic of COVID 19. Practical Implications The dental professional must be cognizant of the fact that anosmia/hyposmia could indicate a more serious underlying local or systemic issue. In the coming months of the new reality of COVID 19, dental practitioners have an additional role of potential early screening of these infections.","Thomas, Davis; Baddireddy, Sita Mahalakshmi; Kohli, Divya",J Am Dent Assoc,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000281772030502X?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.adaj.2020.06.039; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S000281772030502X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32854871/,415

Such rapid development and launch of clinical trials is impressive but presents challenges, including the potential for duplication and competition. There is currently no known effective treatment for COVID‐19. In order to focus on those studies most likely to influence clinical practice, we summarise the 31 currently registered randomised trials with a target sample size of at least 1000 participants. We have grouped these trials into four categories: prophylaxis; treatment of outpatients with mild COVID‐19; treatment of hospitalised patients with moderate COVID‐19; and treatment of hospitalised patients with moderate or severe disease. The most common therapeutic agent being trialled currently is hydroxychloroquine (24 trials with potential sample size of over 25 000 participants), followed by lopinavir–ritonavir (seven trials) and remdesevir (five trials). There are many candidate drugs in pre‐clinical and early phase development, and these form a pipeline for future large clinical trials if current candidate therapies prove ineffective or unsafe.","Davis, Joshua S; Ferreira, David; Denholm, Justin T; Tong, Steven YC",Med J Aust,https://doi.org/10.5694/mja2.50673; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32594562/,415
613638,Does intestinal dysbiosis contribute to an aberrant inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 in frail patients?,2020-09-01,"Respiratory tract infections (RTI) are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in humans. A large number of RTIs is caused by viruses, often resulting in more severe disease in infants, elderly and the immunocompromised. Upon viral infection, most individuals experience common cold-like symptoms associated with an upper RTI. However, in some cases a severe and sometimes life-threatening lower RTI may develop. Reproducible and scalable in vitro culture models that accurately reflect the human respiratory tract are needed to study interactions between respiratory viruses and the host, and to test novel therapeutic interventions. Multiple in vitro respiratory cell culture systems have been described, but the majority of these are based on immortalized cell lines. Although useful for studying certain aspects of viral infections, such monomorphic, unicellular systems fall short in creating an understanding of the processes that occur at an integrated tissue level. Novel in vitro models involving primary human airway epithelial cells and, more recently, human airway organoids, are now in use. In this review, we describe the evolution of in vitro cell culture systems and their characteristics in the context of viral RTIs, starting from advances after immortalized cell cultures to more recently developed organoid systems. Furthermore, we describe how these models are used in studying virus-host interactions, e.g. tropism and receptor studies as well as interactions with the innate immune system. Finally, we provide an outlook for future developments in this field, including co-factors that mimic the microenvironment in the respiratory tract.","Rijsbergen, Laurine C.; van Dijk, Laura L.

The present study investigated the genetic and protectotypic features of newly emerged Korean IBV strains. A phylogenetic analysis showed that several recent isolates formed 2 different clusters (new cluster 1 and 2), which were distinct from other preexisting clusters. New cluster 1 IBV strains represented recombinants between Korean nephropathogenic strain KM91 and the QXIBV strain. New cluster 2 IBV strains showed low amino acid homology (<58.7%) compared with previous isolates. We evaluated the protective efficacy of commercial IBV vaccines (H120 and K2 strain) against these new isolates. In cross-protection studies, the H120 strain did not provide sufficient protection against these variants. However, highly attenuated nephropathogenic IBV vaccine, K2 strain, provided significantly higher levels of protection against variants compared with chickens vaccinated with H120 (P < 0.05 or better). These results indicate that the K2 vaccine could be helpful for the reduction of economic losses caused by newly evolving IBV recombinants (new cluster 1) and variants (new cluster 2).","Lim, T.-H.; Kim, M.-S.; Jang, J.-H.; Lee, D.-H.; Park, J.-K.; Youn, H.-N.; Lee, J.-B.; Park, S.-Y.; Choi, I.-S.; Song, C.-S.",Poult Sci,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032579119401624; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22184432/; https://doi.org/10.3382/ps.2011-01739; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0032579119401624,415

However, ART application can raise relevant ethical issues and could benefit from a comprehensive ethical assessment. Unfortunately, there is a lack of attention to the topic in the scientific literature and, to our knowledge, there is no tool for the ethical assessment of ARTs in the context of conservation that has been described. In the present paper, we show the effects of applying a dedicated ethical self-assessment tool, the Ethical Assessment Tool (ETHAS), to ovum pick-up and in vitro fertilization procedures performed within the BioRescue project. The BioRescue project is an international enterprise using ARTs to save the northern white rhinoceros from extinction. The situation of the northern white rhinoceros is particularly critical as there are only two individuals of this subspecies still alive and they are both infertile females. The application of the ETHAS to the procedures contributed to the overall acceptability of the project and improved communication among the project’s partners. In turn, the tool itself was also refined through an iterative consultation process between experts (both ethicists and scientists) and stakeholders. ABSTRACT: Assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) can make a difference in biodiversity conservation. Their application, however, can create risks and raise ethical issues that need addressing. Unfortunately, there is a lack of attention to the topic in the scientific literature and, to our knowledge, there is no tool for the ethical assessment of ARTs in the context of conservation that has been described. This paper reports the first applications of the Ethical Assessment Tool (ETHAS) to trans-rectal ovum pick-up (OPU) and in vitro fertilization (IVF) procedures used in a northern white rhinoceros (Ceratotherium simum cottoni) conservation project. The ETHAS consists of two checklists, the Ethical Evaluation Sheet and the Ethical Risk Assessment, and is specifically customized for each ART procedure. It provides an integrated, multilevel and standardized self-assessment of the procedure under scrutiny, generating an ethical acceptability ranking (totally, partially, not acceptable) and a risk rank (low, medium, high), and, hence, allows for implementing measures to address or manage issues beforehand. The application of the ETHAS to the procedures performed on the northern white rhinoceros was effective in ensuring a high standard of procedures, contributing to the acceptability and improved communication among the project’s partners. In turn, the tool itself was also refined through an iterative consultation process between experts and stakeholders.","de Mori, Barbara; Spiriti, Maria Michela; Pollastri, Ilaria; Normando, Simona; Biasetti, Pierfrancesco; Florio, Daniela; Andreucci, Francesco; Colleoni, Silvia; Galli, Cesare; Göritz, Frank; Hermes, Robert; Holtze, Susanne; Lazzari, Giovanna; Seet, Steven; Zwilling, Jan; Stejskal, Jan; Mutisya, Samuel; Ndeereh, David; Ngulu, Stephen; Vigne, Richard; Hildebrandt, Thomas B.",Animals (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/ani11020312; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33530613/,415

615566,Late thrombotic complications after SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in hemodialysis patients,2021-05-31,"INTRODUCTION: The COVID‐19 pandemic has impacted global health service delivery, including provision of HIV services. Countries with high HIV burden are balancing the need to minimize interactions with health facilities to reduce the risk of COVID‐19 transmission, while delivering uninterrupted essential HIV prevention, testing and treatment services. Many of these adaptations in resource‐constrained settings have not adequately accounted for the needs of pregnant and breastfeeding women, infants, children and adolescents. We propose whole‐family, tailored programme adaptations along the HIV clinical continuum to protect the programmatic gains made in services. DISCUSSION: Essential HIV case‐finding services for pregnant and breastfeeding women and children should be maintained and include maternal testing, diagnostic testing for infants exposed to HIV, index testing for children whose biological parents or siblings are living with HIV, as well as for children/adolescents presenting with symptoms concerning for HIV and comorbidities. HIV self‐testing for children two years of age and older should be supported with caregiver and provider education. Adaptations include bundling services in the same visit and providing testing outside of facilities to the extent possible to reduce exposure risk to COVID‐19. Virtual platforms can be used to identify vulnerable children at risk of HIV infection, abuse, harm or violence, and link them to necessary clinical and psychosocial support services. HIV treatment service adaptations for families should focus on family based differentiated service delivery models, including community‐based ART initiation and multi‐month ART dispensing. Viral load monitoring should not be a barrier to transitioning children and adolescents experiencing treatment failure to more effective ART regimens, and viral load monitoring for pregnant and breastfeeding women and children should be prioritized and bundled with other essential services. CONCLUSIONS: Protecting pregnant and breastfeeding women, infants, children and adolescents from acquiring SARS‐CoV‐2 while sustaining essential HIV services is an immense global health challenge. Tailored, family friendly programme adaptations for case‐finding, ART delivery and viral load monitoring for these populations have the potential to limit SARS‐CoV‐2 transmission while ensuring the continuity of life‐saving HIV case identification and treatment efforts.","Vrazo, Alexandra C; Golin, Rachel; Fernando, Nimasha B; Killam, Wm P; Sharifi, Sheena; Phelps, B Ryan; Gleason, Megan M; Wolf, Hilary T; Siberry, George K; Srivastava, Meena",J Int AIDS Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32996705/; https://doi.org/10.1002/jia2.25622,415

We hypothesized that recent improvements in immunosuppressive treatment may reduce the incidence of osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH). This study aimed to investigate transitional changes in the incidence of OFNH among renal transplant recipients by MRI. METHODS: Participants comprised 110 patients who had undergone renal transplantation from 2003 to 2012, during which time basiliximab was in regular use at our institute (Recent group), and 232 patients who had undergone RT between 1986 and 2003 (Past group). We compared ONFH incidence between the two groups and evaluated risk factors for ONFH, including immunosuppressants (calcineurin inhibitors, basiliximab, and/or steroids) and postoperative renal function. RESULTS: Incidence of ONFH was lower in the Recent group (0%) than in the Past group (3.4%; p = 0.043). In the Recent group, age was greater, ABO/human leukocyte antigen incompatibility was worse, while steroid dose was decreased and post-transplant renal function was improved. Cumulative methylprednisolone dose at postoperative week 2 and delayed graft function were identified as risk factors for ONFH. CONCLUSION: Risk of ONFH after renal transplantation has fallen with the advent of regular use of basiliximab, although this agent does not appear to be a factor directly associated with the incidence of ONFH.

However, the profile of psychiatric symptoms among COVID-19 patients has been understudied. We performed a meta-analysis of studies assessing psychiatric symptoms of COVID-19 and SARS patients and survivors by using the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R), an instrument covering a wide spectrum of psychiatric symptoms. Studies reporting SCL-90-R subscale scores among patients with and survivors of COVID-19 and SARS were retrieved from major English and Chinese literature databases. Patients’ pooled SCL-90-R subscale scores were compared to the Chinese normative SCL-90-R data, and Cohen’s d values were calculated to indicate the severity of psychiatric symptoms. The Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist for Studies Reporting Prevalence Data was used to assess the quality of the included studies. The search yielded 25 Chinese studies with 1675 acute COVID-19 and 964 acute SARS patients, 30 COVID-19 and 552 SARS survivors during very early recovery (up to 1 month since discharge), 291 SARS survivors during early recovery (1–6 months after discharge), and 48 SARS survivors during late recovery (12 months after discharge). None of the included studies were rated as good quality. The ten SCL-90-R-defined psychiatric symptoms, which were of medium-to-severe severity (d = 0.68–3.01), were all exhibited in acute COVID-19 patients, and the severity of these symptoms decreased to mild-to-medium during very early recovery (d = 0.17–0.73). SARS patients presented eight psychiatric symptoms with mild-to-severe severity during the acute stage (d =0.43–1.88), and thereafter, the severity of symptoms decreased over the follow-up period. However, somatization (d = 0.30) and anxiety (d = 0.28) remained at mild levels during late recovery. A wide variety of severe psychiatric symptoms have been reported by acute COVID-19 patients, and these symptoms, despite decreasing in severity, persist in very early recovery. The changing trajectory observed with SARS suggests that psychiatric symptoms of COVID-19 may persist for a long time after discharge, and therefore, periodic monitoring of psychiatric symptoms, psychosocial support, and psychiatric treatment (when necessary) may be necessary for COVID-19 patients from the acute to convalescent stages.","Xie, Qin; Liu, Xiao-Bo; Xu, Yan-Min; Zhong, Bao-Liang",Transl Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34001863/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41398-021-01416-5,415

Regional implementation of multidisciplinary health care interventions depends on how they perceive collaboration with other health care disciplines, yet research on this topic is limited. This study aimed to explore the views and opinions of cardiologists on multidisciplinary collaboration in HF care. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative study based on face-to-face semi-structured interviews with 11 Belgian cardiologists between September 2019 and February 2020. We used the Qualitative Analysis Guide of Leuven (QUAGOL) method as guidance for data analysis until data saturation was reached. RESULTS: Cardiologists consider the general practitioner (GP) and HF nurse as the most important partners in HF management. Cardiologists identified four problems in current multidisciplinary collaboration: the communication of a HF diagnosis to the patient, advanced care planning, titration of HF medication by the GP and electronic data exchange and communication. Three themes emerged as ideas for improvement of HF care: 1) expansion of the role of the HF nurse, 2) implementation of a structured, patient-centered, and flexible model of disease management program and 3) integrated data approaches. CONCLUSION: Cardiologists value close cooperation with GPs in HF management. They advocate an expanded future role for the HF nurse, increased eHealth, and structured disease management to optimize current HF care.

However, for small-sized viruses, virus tracking studies are usually hindered by a lack of appropriate labeling methods that do not dampen virus yield or infectivity. Here, we report a universal strategy for labeling viruses with chemical dyes and Quantum dots (QDs). Enterovirus 71 (EV71) was produced in a cell line that stably expresses a mutant methionyl-tRNA synthetase (MetRS), which can charge azidonorleucine (ANL) to the methionine sites of viral proteins during translation. Then, the ANL-containing virus was easily labeled with DBCO-AF647 and DBCO-QDs. The labeled virus shows sufficient yield and no obvious decrease in infectivity and can be used for imaging the virus entry process. Using the labeled EV71, different functions of scavenger receptor class B, member 2 (SCARB2), and heparan sulfate (HS) in EV71 infection were comparatively studied. The cell entry process of a strong HS-binding EV71 strain was investigated by real-time dynamic visualization of EV71-QDs in living cells. Taken together, our study described a universal biocompatible virus labeling method, visualized the dynamic viral entry process, and reported details of the receptor usage of EV71.

METHODS: Articles on racial bias were searched on Medline, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Science. Full text review and quality appraisal was conducted, before data was synthesized and analytically themed using the Thomas and Harden methodology. RESULTS: 23 articles were included, involving 1,006 participants. From minority patients’ perspectives, two themes were generated: 1) alienation of minorities due to racial supremacism and lack of empathy, resulting in inadequate medical treatment; 2) labelling of minority patients who were stereotyped as belonging to a lower socio-economic class and having negative behaviors. From providers’ perspectives, one theme recurred: the perpetuation of racial fault lines by providers. However, some patients and providers denied racism in the healthcare setting. CONCLUSION: Implicit racial bias is pervasive and manifests in patient-provider interactions, exacerbating health disparities in minorities. Beyond targeted anti-racism measures in healthcare settings, wider national measures to reduce housing, education and income inequality may mitigate racism in healthcare and improve minority patient care.","Sim, Wilson; Lim, Wen Hui; Ng, Cheng Han; Chin, Yip Han; Yaow, Clyve Yu Leon; Cheong, Clare Wei Zhen; Khoo, Chin Meng; Samarasekera, Dujeepa D.; Devi, M.

However, there is little information regarding prognostic factors and mortality in COVID-19 from Latin American countries. Objectives To determine prognostic factors in hospitalized COVID-19 patients and to evaluate the impact of tocilizumab use in patients with hyperinflammatory syndrome and severe disease defined by the National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2) with a value greater than or equal to seven points. Materials and methods This retrospective cohort study included hospitalized COVID-19 patients from May to July 2020. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to determine independent factors associated with mortality. Results A total of 136 patients required hospital admission. In-hospital mortality was 39.7%. Mortality was observed to be potentiated by older age, LDH serum levels and the presence of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Lymphopenia and lower PaO2/FiO2 ratio were more common in these patients. Similarly, patients who died were classified more frequently with severe disease. The independent factors associated with in-hospital mortality were age greater than 65 years, type 2 diabetes mellitus, NEWS2 greater than or equal to seven points and LDH greater than 400U/L. The use of Tocilizumab alone was not related with decreased in-hospital mortality. Subgroup analysis performed in patients with hyperinflammation and severe disease showed similar results. Conclusions COVID-19 mortality in hospitalized patients was high and mainly related with older age, comorbidities, LDH and the severity of disease at hospital admission.","Nuñez-Ramos, Jose A; Forero Illera, Elias; Quintero Barrios, Jorge Luis; Macareno Arroyo, Hugo Andres; Larios Sanjuan, Didier Johanna; Manzur Barbur, Maria Carolina; Mejia Sanjuanelo, Ana Milena; Mendoza Quevedo, Mauro Duvan; Viasus-Perez, Diego Fernando",Cureus,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34113503/; https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.14865,415
621772,Steroid-responsive severe encephalopathy in SARS-CoV-2 infection,2020-04-17,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To achieve the full potential of deep learning (DL) models, such as understanding the interplay between model (size), training strategy, and amount of training data, researchers and developers need access to new dedicated image datasets; i.e., annotated collections of images representing real-world problems with all their variations, complexity, limitations, and noise. Here, we present, describe and make freely available an annotated transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image dataset. It constitutes an interesting challenge for many practical applications in virology and epidemiology; e.g., virus detection, segmentation, classification, and novelty detection. We also present benchmarking results for virus detection and recognition using some of the top-performing (large and small) networks as well as a handcrafted very small network. We compare and evaluate transfer learning and training from scratch hypothesizing that with a limited dataset, transfer learning is crucial for good performance of a large network whereas our handcrafted small network performs relatively well when training from scratch. This is one step towards understanding how much training data is needed for a given task. METHODS: The benchmark dataset contains 1245 images of 22 virus classes. We propose a representative data split into training, validation, and test sets for this dataset. Moreover, we compare different established DL networks and present a baseline DL solution for classifying a subset of the 14 most-represented virus classes in the dataset. RESULTS: Our best model, DenseNet201 pre-trained on ImageNet and fine-tuned on the training set, achieved a 0.921 F1-score and 93.1% accuracy on the proposed representative test set. CONCLUSIONS: Public and real biomedical datasets are an important contribution and a necessity to increase the understanding of shortcomings, requirements, and potential improvements for deep learning solutions on biomedical problems or deploying solutions in clinical settings. We compared transfer learning to learning from scratch on this dataset and hypothesize that for limited-sized datasets transfer learning is crucial for achieving good performance for large models. Last but not least, we demonstrate the importance of application knowledge in creating datasets for training DL models and analyzing their results.","Matuszewski, Damian J; Sintorn, Ida-Maria",Comput Methods Programs Biomed,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34375851/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmpb.2021.106318,415

True, women generally make healthier lifestyle choices as compared to men. Women do not smoke or drink as much as men, and they have a lower burden of those diseases (heart disease, diabetes or chronic lung conditions) that are known to be significant factors in the higher death rates among men with COVID-19. But there is compelling evidence for a role for biological factors. Genes are likely to play an important role. The X chromosome, of which women possess two, contains the largest number of immune-related genes of the whole human genome, theoretically giving women double the advantage over men in mounting an efficient and rapid immune response. A fundamental difference between women and men is their hormonal milieu, and it is not unreasonable to suppose that the dominant female hormone estrogen could influence the response to infection. In this paper we evaluate the evidence and mechanisms by which estrogen could provide protection to women from a variety of viruses, perhaps including the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.","Pirhadi, Roxanna; Sinai Talaulikar, Vikram; Onwude, Joseph; Manyonda, Isaac",J Clin Med Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33029269/; https://doi.org/10.14740/jocmr4303,415

COVID-19 affects the upper respiratory tract, lungs (pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS]), heart, liver, gastrointestinal tract, and other organs. SARS-CoV‑2 uses ACE2 a receptor to enter host cells. Vasculitis, endothelial damage, thromboembolic events and organ failure are accompanied by a massive cytokine response. Elderly people and those with pre-existing diseases are particularly vulnerable. An efficient antiviral therapy is not yet available.

The molecular details of how the virus navigates through diverse cellular environments and establishes replication are poorly defined. Here, we generated a panel of phenotypically diverse, SARS-CoV-2-infectible human cell lines representing different body organs and performed longitudinal survey of cellular proteins and pathways broadly affected by the virus. This revealed universal inhibition of interferon signaling across cell types following SARS-CoV-2 infection. We performed systematic analyses of the JAK-STAT pathway in a broad range of cellular systems, including immortalized cells and primary-like cardiomyocytes, and found that SARS-CoV-2 targeted the proximal pathway components, including Janus kinase 1 (JAK1), tyrosine kinase 2 (Tyk2), and the interferon receptor subunit 1 (IFNAR1), resulting in cellular desensitization to type I IFN. Detailed mechanistic investigation of IFNAR1 showed that the protein underwent ubiquitination upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, chemical inhibition of JAK kinases enhanced infection of stem cell-derived cultures, indicating that the virus benefits from inhibiting the JAK-STAT pathway. These findings suggest that the suppression of interferon signaling is a mechanism widely used by the virus to evade antiviral innate immunity, and that targeting the viral mediators of immune evasion may help block virus replication in patients with COVID-19. IMPORTANCE SARS-CoV-2 can infect various organs in the human body, but the molecular interface between the virus and these organs remains unexplored. In this study, we generated a panel of highly infectible human cell lines originating from various body organs and employed these cells to identify cellular processes commonly or distinctly disrupted by SARS-CoV-2 in different cell types. One among the universally impaired processes was interferon signaling. Systematic analysis of this pathway in diverse culture systems showed that SARS-CoV-2 targets the proximal JAK-STAT pathway components, destabilizes the type I interferon receptor though ubiquitination, and consequently renders the infected cells resistant to type I interferon. These findings illuminate how SARS-CoV-2 can continue to propagate in different tissues even in the presence of a disseminated innate immune response.","Chen, Da-Yuan; Khan, Nazimuddin; Close, Brianna J.; Goel, Raghuveera K.; Blum, Benjamin; Tavares, Alexander H.; Kenney, Devin; Conway, Hasahn L.; Ewoldt, Jourdan K.; Chitalia, Vipul C.; Crossland, Nicholas A.; Chen, Christopher S.; Kotton, Darrell N.; Baker, Susan C.; Fuchs, Serge Y.; Connor, John H.; Douam, Florian; Emili, Andrew; Saeed, Mohsan",J Virol,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00862-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34260266/,415

Thus, the development of chemical probes to selectively target each kinase is of great interest. Inhibition of protein kinases with ATP-competitive inhibitors has historically been the most widely used method. However, due to the highly conserved structures of ATP-sites, the identification of truly selective chemical probes is challenging.

An effective system for monitoring patients can improve healthcare delivery by avoiding in-person contacts, enabling early-detection of severe cases, and remotely assessing patients’ status. Internet of Things (IoT) technologies have been used for monitoring patients’ health with wireless wearable sensors in different scenarios and medical conditions, such as noncommunicable and infectious diseases. Combining IoT-related technologies with early-warning scores (EWS) commonly utilized in infirmaries has the potential to enhance health services delivery significantly. Specifically, the NEWS-2 has been showing remarkable results in detecting the health deterioration of COVID-19 patients. Although the literature presents several approaches for remote monitoring, none of these studies proposes a customized, complete, and integrated architecture that uses an effective early-detection mechanism for COVID-19 and that is flexible enough to be used in hospital wards and at home. Therefore, this article's objective is to present a comprehensive IoT-based conceptual architecture that addresses the key requirements of scalability, interoperability, network dynamics, context discovery, reliability, and privacy in the context of remote health monitoring of COVID-19 patients in hospitals and at home. Since remote monitoring of patients at home (essential during a pandemic) can engender trust issues regarding secure and ethical data collection, a consent management module was incorporated into our architecture to provide transparency and ensure data privacy.

627169,Is Second dose of vaccination useful in previously SARS-CoV-2 infected Health Care Workers?,2021-06-28,"OBJECTIVES: In this cluster-randomised controlled study (CoV-Surv Study), four different “active” SARS-CoV-2 testing strategies for general population surveillance are evaluated for their effectiveness in determining and predicting the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infections in a given population. In addition, the costs and cost-effectiveness of the four surveillance strategies will be assessed. Further, this trial is supplemented by a qualitative component to determine the acceptability of each strategy. Findings will inform the choice of the most effective, acceptable and affordable strategy for SARS-CoV-2 surveillance, with the most effective and cost-effective strategy becoming part of the local public health department’s current routine health surveillance activities. Investigating its everyday performance will allow us to examine the strategy’s applicability to real time prevalence prediction and the usefulness of the resulting information for local policy makers to implement countermeasures that effectively prevent future nationwide lockdowns. The authors would like to emphasize the importance and relevance of this study and its expected findings in the context of population-based disease surveillance, especially in respect to the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. In Germany, but also in many other countries, COVID-19 surveillance has so far largely relied on passive surveillance strategies that identify individuals with clinical symptoms, monitor those cases who then tested positive for the virus, followed by tracing of individuals in close contact to those positive cases. To achieve higher effectiveness in population surveillance and to reliably predict the course of an outbreak, screening and monitoring of infected individuals without major symptoms (about 40% of the population) will be necessary. While current testing capacities are also used to identify such asymptomatic cases, this rather passive approach is not suitable in generating reliable population-based estimates of the prevalence of asymptomatic carriers to allow any dependable predictions on the course of the pandemic. To better control and manage the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, current strategies therefore need to be complemented by an active surveillance of the wider population, i.e. routinely conducted testing and monitoring activities to identify and isolate infected individuals regardless of their clinical symptoms. Such active surveillance strategies will enable more effective prevention of the spread of the virus as they can generate more precise population-based parameters during a pandemic. This essential information will be required in order to determine the best strategic and targeted short-term countermeasures to limit infection spread locally. TRIAL DESIGN: This trial implements a cluster-randomised, two-factorial controlled, prospective, interventional, single-blinded design with four study arms, each representing a different SARS-CoV-2 testing and surveillance strategy. PARTICIPANTS: Eligible are individuals age 7 years or older living in Germany’s Rhein-Neckar Region who consent to provide a saliva sample (all four arms) after completion of a brief questionnaire (two arms only). For the qualitative component, different samples of study participants and non-participants (i.e. eligible for study, but refuse to participate) will be identified for additional interviews. For these interviews, only individuals age 18 years or older are eligible. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Of the four surveillance strategies to be assessed and compared, Strategy A1 is considered the gold standard for prevalence estimation and used to determine bias in other arms. To determine the cost-effectiveness, each strategy is compared to status quo, defined as the currently practiced passive surveillance approach. Strategy A1: Individuals (one per household) receive information and study material by mail with instructions on how to produce a saliva sample and how to return the sample by mail. Once received by the laboratory, the sample is tested for SARS-CoV-2 using Reverse Transcription Loop-mediated Isothermal Amplification (RT-LAMP). Strategy A2: Individuals (one per household) receive information and study material by mail with instructions on how to produce their own as well as saliva samples from each household member and how to return these samples by mail. Once received by the laboratory, the samples are tested for SARS-CoV-2 using RT-LAMP. Strategy B1: Individuals (one per household) receive information by mail on how to complete a brief pre-screening questionnaire which asks about COVID-19 related clinical symptoms and risk exposures. Only individuals whose pre-screening score crosses a defined threshold, will then receive additional study material by mail with instructions on how to produce a saliva sample and how to return the sample by mail. Once received by the laboratory, the saliva sample is tested for SARS-CoV-2 using RT-LAMP. Strategy B2: Individuals (one per household) receive information by mail on how to complete a brief pre-screening questionnaire which asks about COVID-19 related clinical symptoms. Only individuals whose pre-screening score crosses a defined threshold, will then receive additional study material by mail with instructions how to produce their own as well as saliva samples from each household member and how to return these samples by mail. Once received by the laboratory, the samples are tested for SARS-CoV-2 using RT-LAMP. In each strategy, RT-LAMP positive samples are additionally analyzed with qPCR in order to minimize the number of false positives. MAIN OUTCOMES: The identification of the one best strategy will be determined by a set of parameters. Primary outcomes include costs per correctly screened person, costs per positive case, positive detection rate, and precision of positive detection rate. Secondary outcomes include participation rate, costs per asymptomatic case, prevalence estimates, number of asymptomatic cases per study arm, ratio of symptomatic to asymptomatic cases per study arm, participant satisfaction. Additional study components (not part of the trial) include cost effectiveness of each of the four surveillance strategies compared to passive monitoring (i.e. status quo), development of a prognostic model to predict hospital utilization caused by SARS-CoV-2, time from test shipment to test application and time from test shipment to test result, and perception and preferences of the persons to be tested with regard to test strategies. RANDOMISATION: Samples are drawn in three batches of three continuous weeks. Randomisation follows a two-stage process. First, a total of 220 sampling points have been allocated to the three different batches. To obtain an integer solution, the Cox-algorithm for controlled rounding has been used. Afterwards, sample points have been drawn separately per batch, following a probability proportional to size (PPS) random sample. Second, for each cluster the same number of residential addresses is randomly sampled from the municipal registries (self-weighted sample of individuals). The 28,125 addresses drawn per municipality are then randomly allocated to the four study arms A1, A2, B1, and B2 in the ratio 5 to 2.5 to 14 to 7 based on the expected response rates in each arm and the sensitivity and specificity of the pre-screening tool as applied in strategy B1 and B2. Based on the assumptions, this allocation should yield 2500 saliva samples in each strategy. Although a municipality can be sampled by multiple batches and the overall number of addresses per municipality might vary, the number of addresses contacted in each arm is kept constant. BLINDING (MASKING): The design is single-blinded, meaning the staff conducting the SARS-CoV-2 tests are unaware of the study arm assignment of each single participant and test sample. SAMPLE SIZES: Total sample size for the trial is 10,000 saliva samples equally allocated to the four study arms (i.e. 2,500 participants per arm). For the qualitative component, up to 60 in-depth interviews will be conducted with about 30 study participants (up to 15 in each arm A and B) and 30 participation refusers (up to 15 in each arm A and B) purposefully selected from the quantitative study sample to represent a variety of gender and ages to explore experiences with admission or rejection of study participation. Up to 25 asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 positive study participants will be purposefully selected to explore the way in which asymptomatic men and women diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 give meaning to their diagnosis and to the dialectic between feeling concurrently healthy and yet also being at risk for transmitting COVID-19. In addition, 100 randomly selected study participants will be included to explore participants’ perspective on testing processes and implementation. TRIAL STATUS: Final protocol version is “Surveillance_Studienprotokoll_03Nov2020_v1_2” from November 3, 2020.

Medical education is rapidly moving into a post-COVID world, with the use of SoMe becoming ever more prominent. We explore the risks and benefits of using this technology to assist learning and examine these in light of relevant educational theory. Benefits include accessibility to experts, opportunities for mentorship, access to support networks, resource sharing and global participation. Following the 'Black Lives Matter' movement, SoMe has provided the impetus to adapt medical curricula to address health inequities in minority ethnic individuals. Key criticisms focus on superficial learning, psychological safety, correctly identifying level of expertise, professionalism and ownership protections for content creators. Users have limited ways to manage risk. The medical education community must adapt and rapidly critique SoMe innovations so that they can be better developed and learned from, all the while remaining vigilant.","D039,; Souza, F.; Shah, S.; Oki, O.; Scrivens, L.; Guckian, J.",Future Healthcare Journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34286204/; https://doi.org/10.7861/fhj.2020-0164,415

We have used a novel `gene signature’-based drug repositioning strategy by applying widely accepted gene ranking algorithms to prioritize the FDA approved or under trial drugs. We mined publically available RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) data using CLC Genomics Workbench 20 (QIAGEN) and identified 283 differentially expressed genes (FDR<0.05, log2FC>1) after a meta-analysis of three independent studies which were based on severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in primary human airway epithelial cells. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) revealed that SARS-CoV-2 activated key canonical pathways and gene networks that intricately regulate general anti-viral as well as specific inflammatory pathways. Drug database, extracted from the Metacore and IPA, identified 15 drug targets (with information on COVID-19 pathogenesis) with 46 existing drugs as potential-novel candidates for repurposing for COVID-19 treatment. We found 35 novel drugs that inhibit targets (ALPL, CXCL8, and IL6) already in clinical trials for COVID-19. Also, we found 6 existing drugs against 4 potential anti-COVID-19 targets (CCL20, CSF3, CXCL1, CXCL10) that might have novel anti-COVID-19 indications. Finally, these drug targets were computationally prioritized based on gene ranking algorithms, which revealed CXCL10 as the common and strongest candidate with 2 existing drugs. Furthermore, the list of 283 SARS-CoV-2-associated proteins could be valuable not only as anti-COVID-19 targets but also useful for COVID-19 biomarker development.","Gupta, Rajaneesh K.; Nwachuku, Enyinna L.; Zusman, Benjamin E.; Jha, Ruchira M.; Puccio, Ava M.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34582497/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0257784,415

However, long‐term patient adherence to the recommended interventions remains a key unmet need. In this review we discuss the rationale and potential benefits of a paradigm shift in the clinician‐patient encounter, from focusing on education to explicitly discussing key drivers of individual motivation. This includes the emotional, psychological, and economic mindset that patients bring to their health decisions. Five communication approaches are proposed that progress clinician‐patient preventive cardiology conversations, from provision of information to addressing values and priorities such as common health concerns, love for the family, desire of social recognition, financial stressors, and desire to receive personalized advice. Although further research is needed, these approaches may facilitate developing deeper, more effective bonds with patients, enhance adherence to recommendations and ultimately, improve cardiovascular outcomes.","Duffy, Eamon Y.; Ashen, Dominique; Blumenthal, Roger S.; Davis, Dorothy M.; Gulati, Martha; Blaha, Michael J.; Michos, Erin D.; Nasir, Khurram; Cainzos‐Achirica, Miguel",Clin Cardiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34414588/; https://doi.org/10.1002/clc.23555,415

Use of CO(2) laser in laryngeal surgery has been observed to generate aerosols, however, other techniques, such cold dissection and microdebrider, have not been sufficiently investigated. We aimed to assess whether aerosol generation occurs during laryngeal operations and the effect of different instruments on aerosol production. METHODS: We measured particle concentration generated during surgeries with an Optical Particle Sizer. Cough data collected from volunteers and aerosol concentration of an empty operating room served as references. Aerosol concentrations when using different techniques and equipment were compared with references as well as with each other. RESULTS: Thirteen laryngological surgeries were evaluated. The highest total aerosol concentrations were observed when using CO(2) laser and these were significantly higher than the concentrations when using microdebrider or cold dissection (p < 0.0001, p < 0.0001) or in the background or during coughing (p < 0.0001, p < 0.0001). In contrast, neither microdebrider nor cold dissection produced significant concentrations of aerosol compared with coughing (p = 0.146, p = 0.753). In comparing all three techniques, microdebrider produced the least aerosol particles. CONCLUSIONS: Microdebrider and cold dissection can be regarded as aerosol-generating relative to background reference concentrations, but they should not be considered as high-risk aerosol-generating procedures, as the concentrations are low and do not exceed those of coughing. A step-down algorithm from CO(2) laser to cold instruments and microdebrider is recommended to lower the risk of airborne infections among medical staff.","Sanmark, Enni; Oksanen, Lotta-Maria A.

628940,Syndrome de détresse respiratoire aiguë secondaire à une infection à SARS-COV-2 chez un nourrisson,2020-04-27,"Spaces occupied by organised crime are usually kept secret, hidden, invisible. Japanese criminal syndicates, the yakuza, made instead visibility a key feature of the spaces they occupy through an overt display of their presence in the territory: in the past, a yakuza headquarter could have been instantly recognised by the crest and group name emblazoned on the front wall. However, recent changes in legislation have restrictively regulated these spaces, and the hygienisation of central neighbourhoods that used to be vital loci of yakuza activity has eroded the visibility of the groups. The intensification of the neoliberal drive took these processes to the extreme: political élites are urging to hide the yakuza from international scrutiny. Meanwhile, gentrification and temporary fortification of big cities have already changed the urban landscape and expelled elements of visual disturbance: marginal and dangerous ‘others’ such as the yakuza and the homeless. This article explores the relationship between organised crime and (in)visibility through the unusual case of a criminal group that ironically strives for visibility, and aims to investigate the socio-spatial consequences of the invisibilisation of the yakuza. Based on interviews and institutional documents, this article focuses on the wards of Kabukichō (Tokyo) and Nakasu (Fukuoka) – traditionally spaces of yakuza presence – examining how the increasing grip of the politics of surveillance over urbanscapes and the consequent spatial displacement of the yakuza induced a change in the yakuza’s relationship with their surroundings. As a result, it is argued, this is further contributing to the emergence of new forms of crime challenging the yakuza’s historical monopoly of the underworld.","Baradel, Martina; Bortolussi, Jacopo",Trends Organ Crime,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12117-020-09398-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33173267/,415

The most recent human coronavirus known as COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) has already spread around the world and shown R(0) values from 2.2 to 2.68. However, the ratio between mortality and number of infections seems to be lower in this case in comparison to other human coronaviruses (such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)). These outbreaks have tested the limits of healthcare systems and have posed serious questions about management using conventional therapies and diagnostic tools. In this regard, the use of nanotechnology offers new opportunities for the development of novel strategies in terms of prevention, diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 and other viral infections. In this review, we discuss the use of nanotechnology for COVID-19 virus management by the development of nano-based materials, such as disinfectants, personal protective equipment, diagnostic systems and nanocarrier systems, for treatments and vaccine development, as well as the challenges and drawbacks that need addressing.

Inflammatory factors may play important roles in COVID-19 progression. Yindan Jiedu granules (YDJDG) can inhibit the progression of COVID-19, but the associated mechanism is unclear. PURPOSE: To evaluate the therapeutic effects of YDJDG on COVID-19 and explore its underlying mechanism. METHODS: We recruited 262 participants and randomly assigned 97 patients each to the YDJDG and control groups using one-to-one propensity score matching (PSM). Clinical effects were observed and serum inflammatory and immune indicators were measured. The target network model of YDJDG was established by predicting and determining the targets of identified compounds. The main constituents of the YDJDG extracts were identified and evaluated using high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) and molecular docking. Besides, the anti-inflammatory effects of YDJDG and its specific biological mechanism of action were studied. RESULTS: After PSM, the results showed that compared with the control group, the YDJDG group had a shorter time of dissipation of acute pulmonary exudative lesions (p < 0.0001), shorter time to negative conversion of viral nucleic acid (p < 0.01), more rapid decrease in serum amyloid A level and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (p < 0.0001), and a higher rate of increase in CD4(+)T cell count (p = 0.0155). By overlapping the genes of YDJDG and COVID-19, 213 co-targeted genes were identified. Metascape enrichment analysis showed that 25 genes were significantly enriched in the NF-κB pathway, which were mainly targets of luteolin, quercetin, and kaempferol as confirmed by MS analysis. Molecular docking revealed that the ligands of three compounds had strong interaction with NF-κB p65 and IκBα. In vivo, YDJDG significantly protected animals from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury (ALI), decreasing the lung wet/dry weight ratio, ALI score, and lung histological damage. In LPS-treated RAW264.7 cells, YDJDG suppressed nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65. In vivo and in vitro, YDJDG exerted anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting the production of inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α). These effects were accompanied by the inhibition of NF-ĸB activation and IκBα phosphorylation. CONCLUSION: YDJDG may shorten the COVID-19 course and delay its progression by suppressing inflammation via targeting the NF-κB pathway.","Feng, Ying; Zhu, Bingbing; Liu, Yao; Liu, Yao; Zhou, Guiqin; Yang, Li; Liu, Long; Ren, Jie; Hou, Yixin; Yu, Hao; Meng, Peipei; Jiang, Yuyong; Wang, Xianbo",Phytomedicine,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0944711321003275; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phymed.2021.153784; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0944711321003275?v=s5,415
629791,"The Link between SARS-CoV-2 Infection, Inflammation and Hypercoagulability-Impact of Hemorheologic Alterations on Cardiovascular Mortality",2021-07-06,"Coronavirus has claimed the lives of over half a million people world-wide and this death toll continues to rise rapidly each day. In the absence of a vaccine, non-clinical preventative measures have been implemented as the principal means of limiting deaths. However, these measures have caused unprecedented disruption to daily lives and economic activity. Given this developing crisis, the potential for a second wave of infections and the near certainty of future pandemics, lessons need to be rapidly gleaned from the available data. We address the challenges of cross-country comparisons by allowing for differences in reporting and variation in underlying socio-economic conditions between countries. Our analyses show that, to date, differences in policy interventions have out-weighed socio-economic variation in explaining the range of death rates observed in the data. Our epidemiological models show that across 8 countries a further week long delay in imposing lockdown would likely have cost more than half a million lives. Furthermore, those countries which acted more promptly saved substantially more lives than those that delayed. Linking decisions over the timing of lockdown and consequent deaths to economic data, we reveal the costs that national governments were implicitly prepared to pay to protect their citizens as reflected in the economic activity foregone to save lives. These ‘price of life’ estimates vary enormously between countries, ranging from as low as around $100,000 (e.g. the UK, US and Italy) to in excess of $1million (e.g. Denmark, Germany, New Zealand and Korea). The lowest estimates are further reduced once we correct for under-reporting of Covid-19 deaths.

630294,Differential occupational risks to healthcare workers from SARS-CoV-2: A prospective observational study,2020-06-29,"Introduction: In late 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus, discovered in the city of Wuhan, China, was found to cause a disease later named coronavirus disease 2019, or COVID-19. In January 2020, COVID-19 first reached the Gulf region. Afterwards, the disease spread rapidly across the countries of the Gulf and the number of COVID-19 cases rose significantly. Now, more than a year later, there are only a limited number of studies regarding COVID-19 and its behavior in this region. In this article, we aim to assess the mortality caused by the disease in the Gulf region by calculating the Case Fatality Rates (CFR) for all of the Gulf Cooperation countries and comparing the results with those of Europe. Methods: Data was obtained from the official statistics of the World Health Organization (WHO) from January to May 2020. From the data, the CFR was calculated for every Gulf and European country included in the study. Following the calculation, the results were compared and analyzed. To make our comparison more accurate, we added the total number of COVID-19 tests per 1000 population and the Health Access and Quality index for each individual country. Results: CFRs in the Gulf region to May 12, 2020 were: United Arab Emirates (1.06%), Kuwait (0.69%), Saudi Arabia (0.62%), Oman (0.45%), Bahrain (0.15%), and Qatar (0.06%). Within Europe over the same time period, 10 countries had CFRs above 10%, with the majority above 3%. Conclusions: Compared to Europe, the COVID-19 mortality rate in the Gulf region has been much lower. The difference in age groups between the Gulf region and Europe may be the most important factor, mainly due to a younger population and a smaller elderly demographic in the Gulf region. Although age is a strong factor for the lower CFR in the Gulf, other factors must also be considered. These include the number of COVID-19 tests conducted per population, different country capabilities, and varying criteria for reporting COVID-19 deaths(Table–1)(Table–2).","Rimawi, Ahmad; Rimawi, Asem",Qatar Med J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34589416/; https://doi.org/10.5339/qmj.2021.28,415

We aimed to determine if hs-TnT levels and their timing are independent predictors of adverse events in these patients. DESIGN: Retrospective chart review was performed for all patients hospitalized at our institution between 23 March 2020 and 13 April 2020 who were found to be COVID-19-positive. Clinical, demographic, and laboratory variables including initial and peak hs-TnT were recorded. Univariable and multivariable analyses were completed for a primary composite endpoint of in-hospital death, intubation, need for critical care, or cardiac arrest. RESULTS: In the 276 patients analysed, initial hs-TnT above the median (≥17 ng/L) was associated with increased length of stay, need for vasoactive medications, and death, along with the composite endpoint (OR 3.92, p < 0.001). Multivariable analysis demonstrated that elevated initial hs-TnT was independently associated with the primary endpoint (OR 2.92, p = 0.01). Late-peaking hs-TnT (OR 2.19 for each additional day until peak, p < 0.001) was also independently associated with the composite endpoint.

Health and economic threats caused governments to take preventive measures against the spread of the disease. This study aims to provide a correlation analysis of the response measures adopted by countries and epidemic trends since the COVID-19 outbreak. This analysis picks 13 countries for quantitative assessment. We select a trusted model to fit the epidemic trend curves in segments and catch the characteristics based on which we explore the key factors of COVID-19 spread. This review generates a score table of government response measures according to the Likert scale. We use the Delphi method to obtain expert judgments about the government response in the Likert scale. Furthermore, we find a significant negative correlation between the epidemic trend characteristics and the government response measure scores given by experts through correlation analysis. More stringent government response measures correlate with fewer infections and fewer waves in the infection curves. Stringent government response measures curb the spread of COVID-19, limit the number of total infectious cases, and reduce the time to peak of total cases.

What about antenatal corticosteroids?,2020-05-06,"PURPOSE: Currently, there is an increasing interest regarding the impact of COVID-19 on the thyroid function. As several recent reports have described the onset of thyroid dysfunction in patients diagnosed with COVID-19, we performed a systematic review to assess the prevalence of thyroid dysfunction in patients with COVID-19 as this information could be clinically relevant for the management of these patients. METHODS: A comprehensive computer literature search using PubMed/Medline and Cochrane databases was performed until November 14, 2020 to search original articles evaluating thyroid dysfunction in COVID-19 patients. Information about thyroid dysfunction assessed by thyroid function test was retrieved by the eligible articles. Qualitative analysis (systematic review) only was performed whether a significant heterogeneity of data was detected. RESULTS: Seven studies including 1237 patients with COVID-19 were included. A significant heterogeneity across the studies was found. Most COVID-19 patients were euthyroid with TSH levels in the normal range (from 44 to 94% of the COVID-19 patients assessed in the included studies). The prevalence of thyroid dysfunction in COVID-19 patients (defined as abnormal thyroid function tests) largely varies among the included studies between 13 and 64% of COVID-19 patients as well as clinical presentation. A positive correlation between thyroid dysfunction and clinical severity of COVID-19 was reported. CONCLUSION: Literature data show that thyroid dysfunction is present in a significant percentage of patients with COVID-19. Assessment of thyroid function may be considered in symptomatic COVID-19 patients to have a baseline before introducing thyroid-interfering drugs and those requiring high-intensity care. Further, well-designed studies are needed to better elucidate the impact of COVID-19 on thyroid function and inform thyroid function testing and thyroid dysfunction management in COVID-19 patients.","Giovanella, Luca; Ruggeri, Rosaria M.; Ovčariček, Petra Petranović; Campenni, Alfredo; Treglia, Giorgio; Deandreis, Desiree",Clin Transl Imaging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33728279/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s40336-021-00419-y,415

Disease control measures had been universally implemented in all sample villages. About 74% of informants reported that villagers with wage‐earning jobs outside the village had stopped working due to workplace closures. A higher percentage of rural individuals could not work due to transportation, housing, and other constraints. Local governments had taken measures to reduce the impact of COVID‐19. Although schools in all surveyed villages were closed, 71% of village informants reported that students were attending classes online.

COVID-19 surgical guidelines are continuing to evolve as we deepen our understanding of the virus. A particular point of interest is the possibility of aerosolization of COVID-19 during laparoscopic procedures. There is much uncertainty of the pathogenicity of COVID-19 and insufficient data on the presence and extent of viral load in different body fluids, specifically in peritoneal fluid. We present a case of a 27-year-old male who was diagnosed with acute appendicitis and found to be COVID-19 positive postoperatively. Intraoperative peritoneal fluid sampling was obtained and tested for COVID-19 through real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) targeting N1 and N2 proteins. COVID-19 was not detected in RT-PCR test in the peritoneal fluid collected; however, it was detected in the nasopharyngeal RT-PCR. The patient had prolonged stay in the hospital secondary to COVID-19 symptoms. Currently, there is very limited and inconclusive evidence on the presence of COVID-19 in peritoneal fluid.

Anti-MERS-CoV antibodies play an integral role in the prevention and treatment against MERS-CoV infections. Bioactivity is a key quality attribute of therapeutic antibodies, and high accuracy and precision are required. The major methods for evaluating the antiviral effect of antiviral antibodies include neutralization assays using live viruses or pseudoviruses are highly variable. Recent studies have demonstrated that the antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity of antiviral antibodies is more consistent with the virus clearance effect in vivo than neutralization activity. However, no reports evaluating the ADCC activity of anti-MERS antibodies have been published to date. Here, we describe the development of a robust and reliable cell-based reporter gene assay for the determination of ADCC activity of anti-MERS antibodies using 293T/MERS cells stably expressing the spike protein of MERS-CoV (MERS-S) as target cells and the engineered Jurkat/NFAT-luc/FcγRIIIa stably expressing FcγRIIIA and NFAT reporter gene as effector cells. According to the ICH-Q2 analytical method guidelines, we carefully optimized the experimental conditions and assessed the performance of our assay. In addition, we found that the ADCC activity of afucosylated anti-MERS antibodies is higher than their fucosylated counterparts. The establishment of this ADCC determination system provides a novel method for evaluating the bioactivity of anti-MERS antibodies and improving ADCC activity through modification of N-glycosylation of the Fc segment.","Cao, Junxia; Wang, Lan; Yu, Chuanfei; Wang, Kaiqin; Wang, Wenbo; Yan, Jinghua; Li, Yan; Yang, Yalan; Wang, Xiaomin; Wang, Junzhi",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33024203/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-73960-x,415

Prospective comparative studies with non-CoViD-19 ICU patients are completely lacking. OBJECTIVE: Evaluation of the incidence of DVT in ICU patients with CoViD-19 compared to non-CoViD-19 ICU patients who were treated in the University Hospital Augsburg during the same period. In addition, the aim was to investigate what type of anticoagulation was present in CoViD-19 patients at the time the DVT occurred and to what extent DVT is associated with increased mortality in this patient population. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this prospective single center study, which was conducted between 18 April 2020 and 30 April 2020, 20 SARS-CoV2 positive patients were compared with 20 non-CoVid-19 patients in the ICU with respect to the occurrence of DVT. For this purpose, demographic data, laboratory parameters, and clinical outcomes were recorded and evaluated. RESULTS: The rate of DVT in the investigated patient collective was markedly higher in patients with SARS-CoV2 (CoViD-19 patients 20% vs. non-CoViD-19 patients 5%). Both DVT and elevated D‑dimer levels were associated with increased mortality in the present study. CONCLUSION: We recommend the determination of D‑dimer levels and, in the case of elevated levels, the broad indication for compression sonography of the deep leg veins on admission of patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV2. In this way DVT in the setting of CoViD-19 can be recognized early and therapeutic anticoagulation can be started.

The number of deaths dramatically increased in regions where the number of patients in need of hospital care exceeded the availability of care. Many COVID-19 patients experience Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), a condition that can be treated with mechanical ventilation. In response to the need for mechanical ventilators, designed and tested an emergency ventilator (EV) that can control a patient’s peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) and breathing rate, while keeping a positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP). This article describes the rapid design, prototyping, and testing of the EV. The development process was enabled by rapid design iterations using additive manufacturing (AM). In the initial design phase, iterations between design, AM, and testing enabled a working prototype within one week. The designs of the 16 different components of the ventilator were locked by additively manufacturing and testing a total of 283 parts having parametrically varied dimensions. In the second stage, AM was used to produce 75 functional prototypes to support engineering evaluation and animal testing. The devices were tested over more than two million cycles. We also developed an electronic monitoring system and with automatic alarm to provide for safe operation, along with training materials and user guides. The final designs are available online under a free license. The designs have been transferred to more than 70 organizations in 15 countries.

Sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (SDBS), sodium laureth sulfate (SLS), and two commercial dish soap and liquid hand soap were studied with the goal of evaporation rate reduction in sanitizing liquids to maximize surface contact time. Twelve fluids with different recipes composed of ethanol, isopropanol, SDBS, SLS, glycerin, and water of standardized hardness (WSH) were tested for their evaporation time and virucidal efficiency. Evaporation time increased by 17-63% when surfactant agents were added to the liquid. In addition, surfactant incorporation enhanced the virucidal efficiency between 15-27% according to the 4-field test in the EN 16615:2015 European Standard method.

FIP is a highly fatal systemic disease caused by a virulent feline coronavirus infection in cats. Despite the importance of coronavirus infections in these animals, there are no effective commercial vaccines or antiviral drugs available for these infections. We have previously reported the efficacy of a protease inhibitor in cats with FIP, demonstrating that a virally encoded 3C-like protease (3CLpro) is a valid target for antiviral drug development for coronavirus infections. In this study, we extended our previous work on coronavirus inhibitors and investigated the structure-activity relationships of a focused library of protease inhibitors for ferret and mink 3CLpro. Using the fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay, we identified potent inhibitors broadly effective against feline, ferret and mink coronavirus 3CLpro. Multiple amino acid sequence analysis and modelling of 3CLpro of ferret and mink coronaviruses were conducted to probe the structural basis for these findings.

The European Commission has outlined its commitment to reducing health inequalities. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is a disruptive event with global, national, and local effects on every aspect of a society's life. Therefore, it is of interest to quantify and display health (in)equality induced by COVID-19 over time and on different geographic scales (global, continental, national, regional). We aimed to perform a study of (in)equality regarding COVID-19 related incidences and deaths using the Gini index (GI) that was developed to explore inequality in wealth within or between nations. The GI is a relative measure which quantifies the ratio of the mean absolute difference between observations and their mean: GI=0 describes a situation where everybody owns the same, GI=1 corresponds to one person owning the entire wealth of a society. A specific focus of our analysis is the (in)equality of case-fatality rates. We use global, nation- and statewide data to evaluate the heterogeneity at different levels. We also reflect on the suitability of the Gini index to monitor equality aspects of the pandemic. Data from the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic show a considerable amount of heterogeneity in the global distribution of incidences and deaths. Only few countries contribute largely to the total incidence and death toll. Inequality may result from heterogeneous reporting systems, heterogeneous policy making to fight the pandemic, heterogeneous health systems, and demographic structures. Inequality decreases when going from continental to national or regional levels. Time trends on national level reflect local outbreaks. There is heterogeneity in case fatality rates, too. There is also a specific numeric artefact of the GI: Even if many smaller regions have no COVID-19 related deaths at all, and one region has low (but still non-negligible) number of deaths the corresponding GI is near to 1. We used the Gini index to reflect inequality between incidence and death rates of nations or geographic regions. The interpretation of the differences between reported GIs is not straightforward. However, combined with the information presented by maps, the GI is a useful tool.","Manz, K.; Mansmann, U.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.13.20174011v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.13.20174011,415

639213,SARS-CoV-2 Infection Inducing Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura: Case Series,2021,"Background: In early March 2020, a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in the ski resort Ischgl in Austria initiated the spread of SARS-CoV-2 throughout Austria and Northern Europe. In a cross-sectional study, we found that the seroprevalence in the adult population of Ischgl had reached 45% by the end of April. To answer the question of how long immunity persists and what effect this high-level immunity had on virus transmission, we performed a follow-up study in early November, 2020. Methods: Of the 1259 adults that participated in the baseline study, 801 could be included in the follow-up. The study involved the analysis of binding and neutralizing antibodies and T cell responses. In addition, the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections in Ischgl was compared to the incidence in similar municipalities in Tyrol throughout 2020. Findings: For the 801 individuals that participated in both studies, the seroprevalence declined from 51.4% (95% confidence interval (CI) 47.9 - 54.9) to 45.4% (95% CI 42.0 - 49.0). Median antibody concentrations dropped considerably but antibody avidity increased. T cell responses were analysed in 93 cases, including all 4 formerly seropositive cases that had lost antibodies in all assays, three of which still had detectable T cell memory. In addition, the incidence in the second COVID-19 wave that hit Austria in November 2020, was significantly lower in Ischgl than in comparable municipalities in Tyrol or the rest of Austria. Interpretation: This study has important implications as it shows that although antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 declined, T and B cell memory can be detected for up to 8 months. Complemented by infection prevention measures a level of around 40-45% immunity in Ischgl significantly reduced local virus transmission during the second wave in Austria in November 2020.

This includes social distancing measures (closing businesses, closing schools, and quarantining symptomatic persons) and contact tracing (tracking and following exposed individuals). While preliminary research across the globe has shown these policies to be effective, there is currently a lack of information on the effectiveness of NPIs in the United States. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to create a granular NPI data set at the county level and then analyze the relationship between NPI policies and changes in reported COVID-19 cases. METHODS: Using a standardized crowdsourcing methodology, we collected time-series data on 7 key NPIs for 1320 US counties. RESULTS: This open-source data set is the largest and most comprehensive collection of county NPI policy data and meets the need for higher-resolution COVID-19 policy data. Our analysis revealed a wide variation in county-level policies both within and among states (P<.001). We identified a correlation between workplace closures and lower growth rates of COVID-19 cases (P=.004).

641490,Correction to: Vaccines for SARS-CoV-2: Lessons from Other Coronavirus Strains,2020-11-26,"Plant‐derived bioactive molecules display potential antiviral activity against various viral targets including mode of viral entry and its replication in host cells. Considering the challenges and search for antiviral agents, this review provides substantiated data on chemical constituents of edible fruits with promising antiviral activity. The bioactive constituents like naringenin, mangiferin, α‐mangostin, geraniin, punicalagin, and lectins of edible fruits exhibit antiviral effect by inhibiting viral replication against IFV, DENV, polio, CHIKV, Zika, HIV, HSV, HBV, HCV, and SARS‐CoV. The significance of edible fruit phytochemicals to block the virulence of various deadly viruses through their inhibitory action against the entry and replication of viral genetic makeup and proteins are discussed. In view of the antiviral property of active constituents of edible fruits which can strengthen the immune system and reduce oxidative stress, they are suggested to be diet supplements to combat various viral diseases including COVID‐19. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Considering the increasing threat of COVID‐19, it is suggested to examine the therapeutic efficacy of existing antiviral molecules of edible fruits which may provide prophylactic and adjuvant therapy with their potential antioxidant, anti‐inflammatory, and immune‐modulatory effects. Several active molecules like geraniin, naringenin, (2R,4R)‐1,2,4‐trihydroxyheptadec‐16‐one, betacyanins, mangiferin, punicalagin, isomangiferin, procyanidin B2, quercetin, marmelide, jacalin lectin, banana lectin, and α‐mangostin isolated from various edible fruits have showed promising antiviral properties against different pathogenic viruses. Especially flavonoid compounds extracted from edible fruits possess potential antiviral activity against a wide array of viruses like HIV‐1, HSV‐1 and 2, HCV, INF, dengue, yellow fever, NSV, and Zika virus infection. Hence taking such fruits or edible fruits and their constituents/compounds as dietary supplements could deliver adequate plasma levels in the body to optimize the cell and tissue levels and could lead to possible benefits for the preventive measures for this pandemic COVID‐19 situation.","Santhi, Veerasamy Pushparaj; Masilamani, Poomaruthai; Sriramavaratharajan, Venkatraman; Murugan, Ramar; Gurav, Shailendra S.; Sarasu, Veerasamy Pushparaj; Parthiban, Subbaiyan; Ayyanar, Muniappan",J Food Biochem,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34236082/; https://doi.org/10.1111/jfbc.13851,415

Objective: To examine whether the UK's lockdown measures have had disproportionate impacts on intensity of physical activity in groups who are, or who perceive themselves to be, at heightened risk from COVID-19. Designs, Setting, Participants: UK-wide survey of adults aged over 20, data collected between 2020-04-06 and 2020-04-22. Exposures: Self-reported doctor-diagnosed obesity, hypertension, type I/II diabetes, lung disease, cancer, stroke, heart disease. Self-reported disabilities and depression. Sex, gender, educational qualifications, household income, caring for school-age children. Narrative data on coping strategies. Main Outcomes and Measures: Change in physical activity intensity after implementation of UK COVID-19 lockdown (self-reported). Results: Most (60%) participants achieved the same level of intensity of physical activity during the lockdown as before the epidemic. Doing less intensive physical activity during the lockdown was associated with obesity (OR 1.21, 95% CI 1.02-1.41), hypertension (OR 1.52, 1.33-1.71), lung disease (OR 1.31,1.13-1.49), depression (OR 2.02, 1.82-2.22) and disability (OR 2.34, 1.99-2.69). Participants who reduced their physical activity intensity also had higher odds of being female, living alone or having no garden, and more commonly expressed sentiments about personal or household risks in narratives on coping. Conclusions and relevance: Groups who reduced physical activity intensity included disproportionate numbers of people with either heightened objective clinical risks or greater tendency to express subjective perceptions of risk. Policy on exercise for health during lockdowns should include strategies to facilitate health promoting levels of physical activity in vulnerable groups, including those with both objective and subjective risks.","Rogers, N.

Neutrophil migration is regulated by chemokine receptors and their cognate ligands. Our previous study investigated the effect of n-butanol extract from Folium isatidis on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced septic shock. The present study stimulated neutrophils with LPS to explore the influence of LPS on cell. Neutrophils were then pretreated with n-butanol extract from Folium isatidis followed by LPS to examine the effect of this extract on neutrophil chemotaxis. The results showed that LPS decreased the expression levels of CXC-chemokine receptor (CXCR)1, CXCR2 and L-selectin (CD62L), and increased the expression of interleukin-8 (IL-8) by neutrophils. The addition of n-butanol extract from Folium isatidis inhibited this LPS-induced downregulation of CXCR1, CXCR2 and CD62L, and decreased the expression of IL-8 on neutrophils. In addition, n-butanol extract promoted myeloperoxidase activity in neutrophils. Taken together, LPS downregulated the expression of chemokine receptors, leading to the failure of neutrophils to migrate to sites of infection. The addition of n-butanol extract, which promoted the ability of neutrophils to migrate, is a natural product and potential therapeutic agent with which to target neutrophil chemotaxis during LPS stimulation.","Wu, Beibei; Wang, Liyin; Jiang, Lili; Dong, Lili; Xu, Fengli; Lu, Yili; Jin, Jiahui; Wang, Zhanyue; Liang, Guang; Shan, Xiaoou",Mol Med Rep,https://doi.org/10.3892/mmr.2017.7870; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29115434/,415

In this study, a cascaded system is proposed to segment the lung, detect, localize, and quantify COVID-19 infections from computed tomography images. An extensive set of experiments were performed using Encoder–Decoder Convolutional Neural Networks (ED-CNNs), UNet, and Feature Pyramid Network (FPN), with different backbone (encoder) structures using the variants of DenseNet and ResNet. The conducted experiments for lung region segmentation showed a Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 97.19% and Intersection over Union (IoU) of 95.10% using U-Net model with the DenseNet 161 encoder. Furthermore, the proposed system achieved an elegant performance for COVID-19 infection segmentation with a DSC of 94.13% and IoU of 91.85% using the FPN with DenseNet201 encoder. The proposed system can reliably localize infections of various shapes and sizes, especially small infection regions, which are rarely considered in recent studies. Moreover, the proposed system achieved high COVID-19 detection performance with 99.64% sensitivity and 98.72% specificity.

The spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is overwhelming the response of many regional health services across Italy. This article aims to report and discuss the data of the first 8 weeks of COVID-19 epidemic in the emergency department (ED) of the University Hospital of Parma. METHODS. The ED visits were analyzed as follows: total ED visits, divided in COVID-19/ non-COVID-19 cases, and in trauma-related/non-trauma-related cases; outcome (i.e., discharged, admitted, dead in the ED) of patients, altogether or stratified according to triage class; age classes of the entire ED population. RESULTS. Total ED visits decreased starting from the first days of the outbreak, then exhibiting progressive growth afterwards. COVID suspected cases rapidly increased, whereas non-COVID suspected dropped and remained well below the standard. Trauma-related cases declined, both as ED visits and as hospital admissions. The percentage and absolute number of patients admitted to hospital wards progressively increased, rapidly overwhelming the number of cases that could be discharged. The admission rate in the lowest priority classes also displayed a marked increase. The youngest age classes dramatically declined, whilst the oldest progressively increased, remaining considerably over the standard rate of the local ED. CONCLUSIONS. The COVID-19 pandemic has obliged the health care systems to undergo a paradigm shift. Even triage criteria have partially lost their meaning, as shown by the dramatic increase of hospital admissions, even in the lowest priority classes. A deep re-organizational process of the ED was undertaken. Hospitals must be constantly resilient and prepared to these new emergencies in terms of equipment, medical and nurses staff, larger bed capacity in short time, availability of intensive and sub-intensive beds, and flexibility.

The reverse transcriptase real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) test is currently considered as the gold standard in the laboratory for the etiological detection of COVID-19. However, qRT-PCR results could be false-negative due to the inadequate sensitivity of qRT-PCR. In this study, we have developed and evaluated a novel one-step single-tube nested quantitative real-time PCR (OSN-qRT-PCR) assay for the highly sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 targeting the ORF1ab and N genes. The sensitivity of the OSN-qRT-PCR assay was 1 copy/reaction and 10-fold higher than that of the commercial qRT-PCR kit (10 copies/reaction). The clinical performance of the OSN-qRT-PCR assay was evaluated using 181 clinical samples. Among them, 14 qRT-PCR-negative samples (7 had no repetitive results and 7 had no cycle threshold (CT) values) were detected by OSN-qRT-PCR. Moreover, the 7 qRT-PCR-positives in the qRT-PCR gray zone (CT values of ORF1ab ranged from 37.48 to 39.07, and CT values of N ranged from 37.34 to 38.75) were out of the gray zone and thus were deemed to be positive by OSN-qRT-PCR, indicating that the positivity of these samples is confirmative.

The clinical presentation of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCov) infected pneumonia (NCIP) resembles that of other etiologies of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). We aimed to identify clinical laboratory features to distinguish NCIP from CAP. Methods. We compared the ability of the hematological and biochemical features of 84 patients with NCIP at hospital admission and 316 patients with CAP. Parameters independently predictive of NCIP were calculated by multivariate logistic regression. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was measured to evaluate the discriminative ability. Results. Most hematological and biochemical indexes of patients with NCIP were significantly different from patients with CAP. Nine laboratory parameters were identified to be highly predictive of a diagnosis of NCIP by multivariate analysis. The AUCs demonstrated good discriminatory ability for red cell distribution width (RDW) with an AUC of 0.88 and Hemoglobin (HGB) with an AUC of 0.82. Red blood cell (RBC), albumin (ALB), eosinophil (EO), hematocrit (HCT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and white blood cell (WBC) had fair discriminatory ability. Combinations of any two parameters performed better than did the RDW alone. Conclusions. Routine laboratory examinations may be helpful for the diagnosis of NCIP.

Multiple factors play a role in the development of nailbiting, ranging from genetic components, to underlying psychiatric conditions. Complications of chronic, compulsive nail-biting range from obvious distortion of the nail bed unit, to ungual and oral infection. Dental hygiene is, typically, less well-maintained in patients with nail-biting disorders: teeth may become chipped or notched, and gums many become inflamed. Treatment of nailbiting involves a multidisciplinary team that provides social, psychiatric, dermatologic, and dental care. Treatment ranges from psychotherapy modalities, to medication trials of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and N-acetylcysteine.

Basic and advanced critical care echocardiography, including transesophageal echocardiography, are routinely performed to determine the etiology of hemodynamic instability in undifferentiated shock and to guide subsequent therapy. The use of POCUS in the assessment of volume status is controversial with studies demonstrating that respiratory variation of the IVC is not reliable and with analysis of aortic blood flow velocity after passive leg raising maneuvers being the most promising.

Little is known about the mechanisms by which the virus causes central nervous system (CNS) symptoms, and therefore little guidance is available regarding potential workup or management options. CASES: We present a series of four consecutive cases, seen by our psychiatry consultation service over a one-week period, each of which manifested delirium as a result of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). DISCUSSION: The four cases highlighted here all occurred in older patients with premorbid evidence of cognitive decline. Unique features seen in multiple cases included rigidity, alogia, abulia, and elevated inflammatory markers. In all four cases, a change in mental status was the presenting symptom, and three of the four cases lacked significant respiratory symptoms. In addition to discussing unique features of the cases, we discuss possible pathophysiologic explanations for COVID-19 delirium. CONCLUSIONS: Delirium should be recognized as a potential feature of infection with SARS-CoV-2 and may be the only presenting symptom. Based on the high rates of delirium demonstrated in prior studies, hospitals should consider adding mental status changes to the list of testing criteria. Further research is needed to determine if delirium in COVID-19 represents a primary encephalopathy heralding invasion of the CNS by the virus, or a secondary encephalopathy related to systemic inflammatory response or other factors.","Beach, Scott R.; Praschan, Nathan C.; Hogan, Charlotte; Dotson, Samuel; Merideth, Flannery; Kontos, Nicholas; Fricchione, Gregory L.; Smith, Felicia A.",Gen Hosp Psychiatry,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163834320300694?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32470824/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2020.05.008; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0163834320300694,415

It is shown that inhibition of the proteasome did not affect viral entry and host cell translation but had influence on ARV replication and ARV-induced apoptosis. Evidence is provided to demonstrate that ubiquitin-proteasome blocked ARV replication at an early step in viral life cycle. However, viral transcription and protein translation were also reduced markedly after addition of proteasome inhibitor MG132. Treatment of BHK-21 cells with the MG132 markedly decreased virus titer as well as prevented virus-induced apoptosis. The expression of ARV proteins σC, σA, and σNS was also reduced markedly, suggesting that suppression of virus replication is due to down-regulation of these ARV proteins by ubiquitin-proteasome system. MG132 was also shown to suppress ARV σC-induced phosphrylation of p53 on serine 46, caspase 3 activities, and DNA fragmentation leading to complete inhibition of ARV-induced apoptosis.","Chen, Yu T.; Lin, Chi H.; Ji, Wen T.; Li, Shu K.; Liu, Hung J.",J Virol Methods,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093408001031; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18455810/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093408001031; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2008.03.016,415

Kirtan Kriya meditation has been shown to mitigate the deleterious effects of chronic stress on cognition, reverse memory loss, and create psychological and spiritual wellbeing, which may reduce multiple drivers of Alzheimer’s disease risk. OBJECTIVE: To detail a new concept in medicine called Spiritual Fitness, a merging of stress reduction, basic wellbeing, and psycho/spiritual wellbeing to prevent Alzheimer’s disease. METHODS: The literature on the topics mentioned above is described, including an in-depth discussion on why and how each are critical to advancing the future of Alzheimer’s disease prevention. The many negative effects of chronic stress, and the benefits of Kirtan Kriya, are reviewed. The four pillars of basic wellbeing, six practical aspects of psychological wellbeing, and the four new non-sectarian features of spiritual fitness are then disclosed. Moreover, instructions on practicing Kirtan Kriya are offered in the Supplementary Material. CONCLUSION: Religious and spiritual practices, including Kirtan Kriya, are crucial components in the development of enhanced cognition and well-being, which may help prevent and, in some cases, reverse cognitive decline. The key point of this review is that making a commitment to live a brain longevity lifestyle including spiritual fitness is a critically important way for aging Alzheimer’s disease free.

Although critical to reducing the virus’ reproduction rate, these restrictions come with far-reaching social and economic consequences. In this paper, we investigate the impact of these restrictions on an individual level among software engineers who were working from home. Although software professionals are accustomed to working with digital tools, but not all of them remotely, in their day-to-day work, the abrupt and enforced work-from-home context has resulted in an unprecedented scenario for the software engineering community. In a two-wave longitudinal study (N = 192), we covered over 50 psychological, social, situational, and physiological factors that have previously been associated with well-being or productivity. Examples include anxiety, distractions, coping strategies, psychological and physical needs, office set-up, stress, and work motivation. This design allowed us to identify the variables that explained unique variance in well-being and productivity. Results include (1) the quality of social contacts predicted positively, and stress predicted an individual’s well-being negatively when controlling for other variables consistently across both waves; (2) boredom and distractions predicted productivity negatively; (3) productivity was less strongly associated with all predictor variables at time two compared to time one, suggesting that software engineers adapted to the lockdown situation over time; and (4) longitudinal analyses did not provide evidence that any predictor variable causal explained variance in well-being and productivity. Overall, we conclude that working from home was per se not a significant challenge for software engineers. Finally, our study can assess the effectiveness of current work-from-home and general well-being and productivity support guidelines and provides tailored insights for software professionals.","Russo, Daniel; Hanel, Paul H.

Our objective was to assess the usefulness of lung ultrasound in the short-term follow-up (1 and 3 months) of patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, and to describe the progression of the most relevant lung ultrasound findings. We conducted a prospective, longitudinal and observational study performed in patients with confirmed COVID-19 who underwent a lung ultrasound examination during hospitalization and repeated it 1 and 3 months after hospital discharge. A total of 96 patients were enrolled. In the initial ultrasound, bilateral involvement was present in 100% of the patients with mild, moderate or severe ARDS. The most affected lung area was the posteroinferior (93.8%) followed by the lateral (88.7%). Subpleural consolidations were present in 68% of the patients and consolidations larger than 1 cm in 24%. One month after the initial study, only 20.8% had complete resolution on lung ultrasound. This percentage rose to 68.7% at 3 months. Residual lesions were observed in a significant percentage of patients who recovered from moderate or severe ARDS (32.4% and 61.5%, respectively). In conclusion, lung injury associated with COVID-19 might take time to resolve. The findings in this report support the use of lung ultrasound in the short-term follow-up of patients recovered from COVID-19, as a radiation-sparing, easy to use, novel care path worth exploring.","Hernández-Píriz, Alba; Tung-Chen, Yale; Jiménez-Virumbrales, David; Ayala-Larrañaga, Ibone; Barba-Martín, Raquel; Canora-Lebrato, Jesús; Zapatero-Gaviria, Antonio; Casasola-Sánchez, Gonzalo García De",J Clin Med,https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10143196; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34300362/,415

650392,SARS-CoV-2 vaccination with CoronaVac: seroconversion rate in healthcare workers after 40 days,2021-05-22,"Candidiasis is very common and complicated to treat in some cases due to increased resistance to antifungals. Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) is a promising alternative treatment. It is based on the principle that light of a specific wavelength activates a photosensitizer molecule resulting in the generation of reactive oxygen species that are able to kill pathogens. The aim here is the in vitro photoinactivation of three strains of Candida spp., Candida albicans ATCC 10231, Candida parapsilosis ATCC 22019 and Candida krusei ATCC 6258, using aPDT with different sources of irradiation and the photosensitizer methylene blue (MB), alone or in combination with chlorhexidine (CHX). Irradiation was carried out at a fluence of 18 J/cm(2) with a light-emitting diode (LED) lamp emitting in red (625 nm) or a white metal halide lamp (WMH) that emits at broad-spectrum white light (420–700 nm). After the photodynamic treatment, the antimicrobial effect is evaluated by counting colony forming units (CFU). MB-aPDT produces a 6 log(10) reduction in the number of CFU/100 μL of Candida spp., and the combination with CHX enhances the effect of photoinactivation (effect achieved with lower concentration of MB). Both lamps have similar efficiencies, but the WMH lamp is slightly more efficient. This work opens the doors to a possible clinical application of the combination for resistant or persistent forms of Candida infections.","Pérez-Laguna, Vanesa; Barrena-López, Yolanda; Gilaberte, Yolanda; Rezusta, Antonio",Pharmaceutics,https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmaceutics13081176; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34452140/,415

The country is introducing an organized screening system, including human papillomavirus screening. Studies show a high dropout rate among eligible women in continuing testing. METHODS: This descriptive-analytic study was part of the first phase of a clinical trial conducted on a random sample of 400 women aged 18–49 in Andimeshk City, Khuzestan Province, in 2020. The data collection tool consisted of a man-made questionnaire that included domains of demographic characteristics, knowledge, attitude, practice, and self-efficacy in the Pap smear test. The data were analyzed with Stata-16 using linear and logistic regression models. RESULTS: The mean knowledge, attitude, and self-efficacy scores were 6.80±2.33, 34.99±4.32, and 28.67±7.34, respectively. In the multiple models, every unit increase in the knowledge or attitude scores raised the mean self-efficacy score by 1.04 and 0.48, respectively (P<0.001). Every unit increase in the knowledge and self-efficacy scores increased the chance of performing Pap smear 1.61 and 1.41 times, respectively (P<0.001). CONCLUSION: Given the association of women’s knowledge and self-efficacy with practice in performing the Pap smear, it seems that an effective program promoting women’s health behavior regarding CC screening would include applied education to raise community awareness and improve women’s attitudes, self-efficacy, and practice.","Ghalavandi, Shahnaz; Heidarnia, Alireza; Zarei, Fatemeh; Beiranvand, Reza",Obstet Gynecol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33355856/; https://doi.org/10.5468/ogs.20236,415

The present study reviewed all studies with imaging findings presentation of LAP after COVID-19 vaccination. MATERIALS AND METHODS: : We conducted a literature search in online databases, including Scopus, Medline (PubMed), Web of Science, Embase (Elsevier), Cochrane library, and Google Scholar. RESULTS: : A total of 19 studies (68 cases), including 60 (88.2%) females and 8 (11.8%) males with a presentation of LAP after COVID-19 vaccination, were reviewed. LAP was identified after first or second dosages of three types of COVID-19 vaccines, including Pfizer-BioNTech (n = 30, 44.1%), Moderna (n = 17, 25%), and Oxford-AstraZeneca (n = 1, 1.5%). In 20 (29.4%) cases, vaccine type was not reported or only reported as mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. The median days of LAP presentation after the first and second dosages of COVID-19 vaccination, were 12 and 5 days, respectively. Most of the LAP imaging findings related to COVID-19 vaccination (n = 66, 97%) were seen from first day to four weeks after vaccination. However, LAP remained after 5 and 6 weeks of the first and second dosages of COVID-19 vaccination with decreased lymph nodes’ size and residual cortical thickening in two cases. CONCLUSION: : This review study of cases with LAP-associated COVID-19 vaccination guides radiologists and physicians to rely on patient's clinical context and updated resources to prevent potential disease upstaging and change in therapy.","Keshavarz, Pedram; Yazdanpanah, Fereshteh; Rafiee, Faranak; Mizandari, Malkhaz",Acad Radiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33985872/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acra.2021.04.007; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1076633221001963; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1076633221001963?v=s5,415

The lipid lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) concentrations are enhanced in patients upon HCV or SARS-CoV-2 infection, but the function of LPA and its receptors in innate immunity is largely unknown. Here, we found that viral infection promoted the G protein–coupled receptor LPA1 expression, and LPA restrained type I/III interferon production through LPA1. Mechanistically, LPA1 signaling activated ROCK1/2, which phosphorylated IRF3 Ser(97) to suppress IRF3 activation. Targeting LPA1 or ROCK in macrophages, fibroblasts, epithelial cells, and LPA1 conditional KO mice promoted interferon-induced clearance of multiple viruses. LPA1 was colocalized with the receptor ACE2 in lung and intestine. Together with previous findings that LPA1 and ROCK1/2 promoted vascular leaking or lung fibrosis, we propose that the current available preclinical drugs targeting the LPA1-ROCK module might protect from SARS-CoV-2 or various virus infections in the intestine or lung.","Zhang, Chi; Li, Weiyun; Lei, Xiaobo; Xie, Zhenfei; Qi, Linlin; Wang, Hui; Xiao, Xia; Xiao, Jun; Zheng, Yuxiao; Dong, Chen; Zheng, Xin; Chen, Shiyang; Chen, Jianfeng; Sun, Bing; Qin, Jun; Zhai, Qiwei; Li, Jinsong; Wei, Bin; Wang, Jianwei; Wang, Hongyan",Sci Adv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34533996/; https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abb5933,415

Here we report that IAV-infected knockout mice lacking the Ifitm locus on chromosome 7 exhibited accelerated disease progression, greater mortality, and higher pulmonary and systemic viral burdens as compared to wild type controls. We further observed that the phenotype of Ifitm3-specific knockout mice was indistinguishable from that of mice lacking the entire Ifitm locus. Ifitm3 was expressed by IAV target cells including alveolar type II pneumocytes and tracheal/bronchial respiratory epithelial cells. Robust Ifitm3 expression was also observed in several tissues in the absence of infection. Among murine Ifitm promoters, only that of Ifitm3 could be induced by type I and II interferons. Ifitm3 could also be upregulated by the gp130 cytokines IL-6 and oncostatin M on cells expressing appropriate receptors, suggesting that multiple cytokine signals could contribute to Ifitm3 expression in a cell or tissue-specific manner. Collectively, these findings establish a central role for Ifitm3 in limiting acute influenza in vivo, and provide further insight into Ifitm3 expression and regulation.","Bailey, Charles C.; Huang, I-Chueh; Kam, Christina; Farzan, Michael",PLoS Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22969429/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1002909,415

This study analyzes its impact on urgent dental care in the Department of Conservative Dentistry and Periodontology, University Hospital Munich and Bavaria, Germany. Patient numbers without and with positive/suspected COVID-19 infection, their reasons for attendance, and treatments were retrospectively recorded (February–July 2020) and linked to local COVID-19 infection numbers, control measures, and numbers/reasons for closures of private dental practices in Bavaria, Germany. Patient numbers decreased within the urgent care unit and the private dental practices followed by a complete recovery by the end of July. While non-emergency visits dropped to almost zero during the first lockdown, pain-related treatments were administered invariably also in patients with positive/suspected COVID-19 infections. Reasons for practice closures were lack of personal protective equipment (PPE), lack of employees, staff’s increased health risks, and infected staff, which accounted for 0.72% (3.6% closures in total). Pain-driven urgent dental care remains a constant necessity even in times of high infection risk, and measures established at the beginning of the pandemic seem to have provided a safe environment for patients as well as oral health care providers. PPE storage is important to ensure patients’ treatment under high-risk conditions, and its storage and provision by regulatory units might guarantee a stable and safe oral health care system in the future.","Walter, Elias; von Bronk, Leonard; Hickel, Reinhard; Huth, Karin Christine",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18157963; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34360255/,415
652445,Olfactory Training and Visual Stimulation Assisted by a Web Application for Patients With Persistent Olfactory Dysfunction After SARS-CoV-2 Infection: Observational Study,2021-05-27,"BACKGROUND: Authorities need to recognize that, while rare, gonorrhea can be transmitted nonsexually, and should not be presumed definitive evidence of abuse. We report the unusual case of a girl diagnosed with Neisseria gonorrhoeae after bathing in a heavily frequented hot pool at the edge of the crater lake Specchio di Venere (“Mirror of Venus”) on Pantelleria Island, Italy. CASE PRESENTATION: Two days after bathing in the pool, this 11-year-old Austrian girl developed vulvovaginitis that partially settled with antifungal cream. Subsequent swabs cultured positive for Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Family members tested negative. The child adamantly denied any sexual contact, and no opportunities for sexual exposure could be identified. It was therefore concluded that she must have acquired the infection from pool water contaminated by gonococcus after a 2-day incubation period. The infection was successfully treated with ceftriaxone and azithromycin with no adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS: The pools are shallow, close to body temperature, isotonic, slightly acidic from CO(2) bubbles, and contain organic particles, all potentially supporting survival of gonococcus. There are historical case reports in the literature of gonococcal epidemics in children’s hospitals being traced to common baths. It is imperative that all cases of gonococcal infection in children are fully investigated, including examining all other relevant family members, to determine whether sexual assault has occurred. This is not a diagnosis to be missed. However, both sexual and nonsexual transmission are possible. A presumption that a gonococcal infection is diagnostic of sexual abuse can be dire, with children wrongfully removed from their parents’ care, and their caregivers facing false charges of sexual crimes. Our case serves to illustrate that the very uncommon diagnosis of gonorrhea in a child may be the result of nonsexual transmission of the infection, and that contaminated hot pools are a very rare source of infection that should be considered.","Goodyear-Smith, Felicity; Schabetsberger, Robert",J Med Case Rep,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13256-021-03043-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34530901/,415
653547,The Increased Burden of SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Orthopaedic Trauma Patients: Comparison of Demographics of Both the Waves of the Pandemic—An Indian Tertiary Center Experience,2021-09-13,"It has been demonstrated that the length of the poly(A) tail in the bovine coronavirus (BCoV), which belongs to genus betacoronaviruses, is regulated throughout infection in human rectal tumor-18 (HRT-18) cells, and the length of the poly(A) tail is associated with the efficiency of virus translation. Here, we examined whether the regulation of viral poly(A) tail length is cell-type independent and whether it is a common feature of coronaviruses to assess the significance of the regulation. By ligating head-to-tail viral RNA positive strands and sequencing, we found that (1) the regulation pattern of coronaviral poly(A) tail length in BCoV-infected hamster kidney-21 (BHK-21) cells was similar to that in BCoV-infected HRT-18 cells and (2) the poly(A) tail length of wild-type avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) virulent strain IBV-TW1, which is in the genus gammacoronaviruses, varied throughout infection in primary chicken embryo kidney (CEK) cells and in the tracheas of 1-day-old chicks. Interestingly, the poly(A) tail length variation was similarly found in the avirulent IBV strain H120 in CEK cells, although the overall poly(A) tail length was shorter for this virus. The results suggest that the regulation of coronaviral poly(A) tail length during infection may be a common feature among coronaviruses and can occur in a noncancerous cell line (BHK-21 cells), primary cell culture (CEK cells), and living system (chickens), further reinforcing the biological significance of this regulation during coronavirus infection.

First studies report an impact on mental health of the general population showing increased levels of anxiety, stress and depression. In this study, we compared the impact of the pandemic on two culturally and economically similar European countries: the UK and Germany. METHODS: Participants (UK = 241, German = 541) completed an online-survey assessing COVID-19 exposure, impact on financial situation and work, substance and media consumption, mental health using the Symptom-Check-List-27 (SCL-27) and the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire. RESULTS: We found distinct differences between the two countries. UK responders reported a stronger direct impact on health, financial situation and families. UK responders had higher clinical scores on the SCL-27, and higher prevalence. Interestingly, German responders were less hopeful for an end of the pandemic and more concerned about their life-stability. CONCLUSION: As 25% of both German and UK responders reported a subjective worsening of the general psychological symptoms and 20–50% of German and UK responders reached the clinical cut-off for depressive and dysthymic symptoms as well as anxieties, it specifically shows the need for tailored intervention systems to support large proportions of the general public.

Currently, the World Health Organization (WHO) has defined the infection as a global pandemic and there is a health and social emergency for the management of this new infection. While most people with COVID-19 develop only mild or uncomplicated illness, approximately 14% develop severe disease that requires hospitalization and oxygen support, and 5% require admission to an intensive care unit.

METHODS: We employed a set of combined ultrasound parameters and histopathological images obtained simultaneously in 28 patients (15 women, 0.6–83 years) with fatal COVID-19 submitted to minimally invasive autopsies, with different times of disease evolution from initial symptoms to death (3–37 days, median 18 days). For each patient, we analysed eight post-mortem LUS parameters and the proportion of three histological patterns (normal lung, exudative diffuse alveolar damage [DAD] and fibroproliferative DAD) in eight different lung regions. The relationship between histopathological and post-mortem ultrasonographic findings was assessed using various statistical approaches. RESULTS: Statistically significant positive correlations were observed between fibroproliferative DAD and peripheral consolidation (coefficient 0.43, p = 0.02) and pulmonary consolidation (coefficient 0.51, p = 0.005). A model combining age, time of evolution, sex and ultrasound score predicted reasonably well (r = 0.66) the proportion of pulmonary parenchyma with fibroproliferative DAD.

654661,SARS-COV-2 infection outcomes in patients with congenital generalized lipodystrophy,2021-06-13,"The prevalence of asthma has increased worldwide. Asthma exacerbations triggered by upper respiratory tract viral infections remain a major clinical problem and account for hospital admissions and time lost from work. Virus-induced asthma exacerbations cause airway inflammation, resulting in worsening asthma and deterioration in the patients’ quality of life, which may require systemic corticosteroid therapy. Despite recent advances in understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying asthma exacerbations, current therapeutic modalities are inadequate for complete prevention and treatment of these episodes. The pathological role of cellular senescence, especially that involving the silent information regulator 2 homolog sirtuin (SIRT) protein family, has recently been demonstrated in stable and exacerbated chronic respiratory disease states. This review discusses the role of SIRT1 in the pathogenesis of bronchial asthma. It also discusses the role of SIRT1 in inflammatory cells that play an important role in virus-induced asthma exacerbations. Recent studies have hypothesized that SIRT1 is one of major contributors to cellular senescence. SIRT1 levels decrease in Th2 and non-Th2-related airway inflammation, indicating the role of SIRT1 in several endotypes and phenotypes of asthma. Moreover, several models have demonstrated relationships between viral infection and SIRT1.

However, limited work has been performed towards the modelling of complex associations between the combined demographic attributes and varying nature of the COVID-19 infections across the globe. This study presents an intelligent approach to investigate the multi-dimensional associations between demographic attributes and COVID-19 global variations. We gather multiple demographic attributes and COVID-19 infection data (by 8 January 2021) from reliable sources, which are then processed by intelligent algorithms to identify the significant associations and patterns within the data. Statistical results and experts' reports indicate strong associations between COVID-19 severity levels across the globe and certain demographic attributes, e.g. female smokers, when combined together with other attributes. The outcomes will aid the understanding of the dynamics of disease spread and its progression, which in turn may support policy makers, medical specialists and society, in better understanding and effective management of the disease.","Khan, Wasiq; Hussain, Abir; Khan, Sohail Ahmed; Al-Jumailey, Mohammed; Nawaz, Raheel; Liatsis, Panos",R Soc Open Sci,https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.201823; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33614100/,415

OBJECTIVE: This paper sets out to evaluate the feasibility and potential benefits of using computer serious game in a non-immersive virtual reality (VR) implemented and evaluated completely remotely in participants with CP for Home-Based Telerehabilitation during the quarantine period for COVID-19. METHODS: Using a cross-sectional design, a total of 44 individuals participated in this study between March and June 2020, 22 of which had CP (14 males and 8 females, mean age = 19 years, ranging between 11 and 28 years) and 22 typically developing individuals, matched by age and sex to the individuals with CP. Participants practiced a coincident timing game(1) and we measured movement performance and physical activity intensity using the rating of perceived exertion Borg scale. RESULTS: All participants were able to engage with the VR therapy remotely, reported enjoying sessions, and improved performance in some practice moments. The most important result in this cross-sectional study was the significant increasing in rating of perceived exertion (through Borg scale) in both groups during practice and with CP presenting a higher rating of perceived exertion. CONCLUSION: Children with CP enjoyed participating, were able to perform at the same level as their peers on certain activities and increased both their performance and physical activity intensity when using the game, supporting the use of serious games for this group for home therapy and interactive games.

The aim of this report is to present an unusual case of a severe COVID-19 patient managed at home in a developing country, and to discuss some of the available guidelines and potential therapeutic options for this type of cases. CASE PRESENTATION: A 60-year-old female seeking medical attention through teleconsultation presents with profound dyspnea, oppressive chest pain, fatigue, episodic hallucinations, and difficulty sleeping, for what she originally sought medical attention at an ER but could not be admitted due to saturation of the health system. A positive PCR test for COVID-19, and a CT scan of the chest showing bilateral consolidations with ground-glass opacities confirmed the diagnosis. The patient was managed at home, with corticosteroids, nitazoxanide and a single dose of 40 mg of subcutaneous enoxaparin. Colchicine was added at the third day of treatment. Standard oxygen therapy through nasal cannula was also recommended. Daily follow-ups were established to monitor for signs of clinical improvement. Two weeks later from the initial consultation the patient presents marked improvement in her symptoms, as well as in her CT scan, which prompted in discontinuation of the medications and the oxygen therapy. CONCLUSIONS: There are several limitations in this report regarding the clinical data and the management, but such limitations do also reflect the state of emergency and the chaos that resides in the health care systems of developing nations. For the ambulatory care of COVID-19 patients, several aspects of disease management may differ from current guidelines and basic requirements may represent a huge challenge to cover. Further research is needed to assist physicians in the daily clinical decision making, to optimize patient outcomes, and to reduce the probability of adverse scenarios of patients with COVID-19 managed in the ambulatory setting.","Chérrez-Ojeda, Ivan; Vanegas, Emanuel; Felix, Miguel",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33213364/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-020-05608-0,415

One such host protein, p97 or the valosin-containing protein (VCP), is a highly conserved AAA ATPase that facilitates replication of diverse RNA- and DNA-containing viruses. The wide range of cellular functions attributed to this ATPase is consistent with its participation in multiple steps of the virus life cycle from entry and uncoating to viral egress. Studies of VCP/p97 interactions with viruses will provide important information about host processes and cell biology, but also viral strategies that take advantage of these host functions. The critical role of p97 in viral replication might be exploited as a target for development of pan-antiviral drugs that exceed the capability of virus-specific vaccines or therapeutics.","Das, Poulami; Dudley, Jaquelin P.",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v13091881; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34578461/,415

Nevertheless, the sample from Malaysia is still under-sequenced. Hence lacking clarity of the circulating strain in Malaysia leads to a deadlock in understanding the virus infectivity. This study aimed to investigate the genome identity of circulating COVID-19 strains in Pahang and understand disease epidemiology during the pandemic. This study leveraged high-throughput sequencing analysis for the whole genome sequencing and implemented bioinformatic technique for the analysis. Here we reported that the virus with D614G mutation in Spike protein circulates in a few Malaysia states before the Sivagangga cluster announced in Kedah in July 2020. This mutated virus includes our virus sample isolated in April 2020 from an asymptomatic patient in Pahang. Based on the phylogenetic analysis, we discovered the origin of our sample Pahang/IIUM91 was not related to Sivagangga cluster. Here, we have generated 3D structure model of Pahang/IIUM91 Spike protein. D614G mutation in Pahang/IIUM91 Spike protein increases viral stability and flexibility, hence render higher infectivity. Collectively, our results suggest for the establishment of a complete SARS-CoV-2 genome database in Malaysia.

This study compares the FREND(TM) COVID-19 IgG/IgM Duo (NanoEntec) a point of care (POCT) assay with the automated Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2 electrochemiluminescent assay (Roche Diagnostics). Methods: Serum samples (n = 81) from PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive patients at different time points after the onset of symptoms were analyzed with both assays. An additional 24 serum samples with cross reactivity potential were also included. Results: The sensitivity of the COVID-19 IgG/IgM Duo assay was higher as compared to the Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay, especially when using the combined IgM/IgG result in samples analyzed within 6 days after the onset of symptoms (46.2% vs. 15.4%). The sensitivity of both assays increased with increasing time interval after the onset of symptoms and reached 100% for the COVID-19 IgG/IgM Duo assay in samples taken 14 days or more after symptom onset. Specificity of the COVID-19 IgG/IgM Duo assay was 95.8% for IgM, 91.7% for IgG and 87.5% for the combination of both. Conclusion: This study shows that the sensitivity of both assays was highly dependent on the time interval between the onset of the COVID-19 symptoms and serum sampling. Furthermore, rapid serological testing for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies by means of the FREND(TM) COVID-19 IgG/IgM Duo POCT assay showed a comparable diagnostic performance as the reference automated immunoassay.","De Munck, Dorien G.; Peeters, Bart; Huyghe, Evelyne; Goossens, Herman; Ieven, Margareta; Matheeussen, Veerle",Acta clinica Belgica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34152943/; https://doi.org/10.1080/17843286.2021.1940776,415

As the complex screening of athletes is essential for safe and successful sports, we aimed to repeat the 2019-year sports cardiology screening of the Olympic Swim Team before the Olympics and to compare the results of COVID and non-COVID athletes. Methods: Patient history, electrocardiogram, laboratory tests, body composition analysis, echocardiography, cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) were performed. We used time-ranking points to compare swimming performance. Results: From April 2019, we examined 46 elite swimmers (24 ± 4 years). Fourteen swimmers had COVID infection; all cases were mild. During CPET there was no difference in the performance of COVID (male: VO(2) max 55 ± 4 vs. 56.5 ± 5 mL/kg/min, p = 0.53; female: VO(2) max 54.6 ± 4 vs. 56 ± 5.5 mL/kg/min, p = 0.86) vs. non-COVID athletes (male VO(2) max 56.7 ± 5 vs. 55.5 ± 4.5 mL/kg/min, p = 0.50; female 49.6 ± 3 vs. 50.7 ± 2.6 mL/kg/min, p = 0.47) between 2019 and 2021. When comparing the time results of the National Championships, 54.8% of the athletes showed an improvement (p = 0.75).

Herein we provide evidence that SARS-CoV-2 spreads through cell-cell contact in cultures, mediated by the spike glycoprotein. SARS-CoV-2 spike is more efficient in facilitating cell-to-cell transmission than SARS-CoV spike, which reflects, in part, their differential cell-cell fusion activity. Interestingly, treatment of cocultured cells with endosomal entry inhibitors impairs cell-to-cell transmission, implicating endosomal membrane fusion as an underlying mechanism. Compared with cell-free infection, cell-to-cell transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is refractory to inhibition by neutralizing antibody or convalescent sera of COVID-19 patients. While ACE2 enhances cell-to-cell transmission, we find that it is not absolutely required. Notably, despite differences in cell-free infectivity, the variants of concern (VOC) B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 have similar cell-to-cell transmission capability. Moreover, B.1.351 is more resistant to neutralization by vaccinee sera in cell-free infection, whereas B.1.1.7 is more resistant to inhibition by vaccine sera in cell-to-cell transmission. Overall, our study reveals critical features of SARS-CoV-2 spike-mediated cell-to-cell transmission, with important implications for a better understanding of SARS-CoV-2 spread and pathogenesis.","Zeng, Cong; Evans, John P.; King, Tiffany; Zheng, Yi-Min; Oltz, Eugene M.; Whelan, Sean P.

661084,Healthcare workers and protection against inhalable SARS-CoV-2 aerosols,2021-03-18,"Age is one of the most important prognostic factors associated to lethality in SARS-CoV-2 infection. In multivariate analysis, advanced age was an independent risk factor for death. Recent studies suggest a role for the nucleotide-binding domain and leucine rich repeat containing family, pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation in lung inflammation and fibrosis in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infections. Increased NLRP3/ apoptosis-associated speck-like protein (ASC) mRNA expression and increased caspase-1 activity, have been observed in aged lung, provoking increased and heightened expression levels of mature Interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18 in aged individuals. Aged individuals have a basal predisposition to over-react to infection, displaying an increased hyper-inflammatory cascade, that seems not to be fully physiologically controlled. NLRP3 inflammasome is over-activated in aged individuals, through deficient mitochondrial functioning, increased mitochondrial Reactive Oxigen Species (mtROS) and/or mitochondrial (mt)DNA, leading to a hyper-response of classically activated macrophages and subsequent increases in IL-1 β. This NLRP3 over-activated status in elderly individuals, is also observed in telomere dysfunctional mice models. In our opinion, the NLRP3 inflammasome plays a central role in the increased lethality observed in elderly patients infected by COVID-19. Strategies blocking inflammasome would deserve to be studied.","Lara, Pedro C; Macías-Verde, David; Burgos-Burgos, Javier",Aging Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32765942/; https://doi.org/10.14336/ad.2020.0601,415

Clinical presentations range from asymptomatic, mild respiratory tract infection, to severe cases with acute respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory failure, and death. Reports on a dysregulated immune system in the severe cases call for a better characterization and understanding of the changes in the immune system. METHODS: In order to dissect COVID-19-driven immune host responses, we performed RNA-seq of whole blood cell transcriptomes and granulocyte preparations from mild and severe COVID-19 patients and analyzed the data using a combination of conventional and data-driven co-expression analysis. Additionally, publicly available data was used to show the distinction from COVID-19 to other diseases. Reverse drug target prediction was used to identify known or novel drug candidates based on finding from data-driven findings. RESULTS: Here, we profiled whole blood transcriptomes of 39 COVID-19 patients and 10 control donors enabling a data-driven stratification based on molecular phenotype. Neutrophil activation-associated signatures were prominently enriched in severe patient groups, which was corroborated in whole blood transcriptomes from an independent second cohort of 30 as well as in granulocyte samples from a third cohort of 16 COVID-19 patients (44 samples). Comparison of COVID-19 blood transcriptomes with those of a collection of over 3100 samples derived from 12 different viral infections, inflammatory diseases, and independent control samples revealed highly specific transcriptome signatures for COVID-19. Further, stratified transcriptomes predicted patient subgroup-specific drug candidates targeting the dysregulated systemic immune response of the host. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides novel insights in the distinct molecular subgroups or phenotypes that are not simply explained by clinical parameters. We show that whole blood transcriptomes are extremely informative for COVID-19 since they capture granulocytes which are major drivers of disease severity.

DESIGN: Data collection involved an anonymous cross-sectional online SurveyMonkey™ questionnaire. METHODS: An email invitation to complete the survey was sent to the 1842 members of the British Orthodontic Society on 9 June 2020 with a follow-up reminder on 15 July 2020. The invitation contained a brief description and online link to the questionnaire, which was active between 9 June and 9 August 2020. The 15-item questionnaire covered frequency of reading, preferred format, likes and dislikes, and what changes might improve the Journal. Data were analysed for the membership as a whole using simple descriptive statistics. RESULTS: In total, 310 individuals completed the questionnaire, representing a response rate of 17% with 74.2% (n = 230) reporting reading at least one article per issue. The most popular way of reading the Journal (77.4%, n = 240) was through the distributed print copy. Overall, 63.6% (n=197) rated the Journal as excellent and 35.2% (n = 109) as satisfactory, with only 1.3% (n = 4) responding that it was poor. The scientific and clinical articles were the most popular aspect of the Journal and 90.3% (n = 280) of respondents felt the Journal content was relevant to their current clinical practice. Respondents were also given the opportunity to make additional free-text comments; and themes that emerged included a wish for more clinical content, more online interaction with authors through webinars and continued professional development.

We explored the self-reported immunity to varicella, measles, mumps, and rubella, reasons for receiving the influenza vaccine or not, and opinions on vaccination of HCWs against varicella, MMR, pertussis, diphtheria, and influenza among staff from departments with a high risk of exposure to infectious agents. METHODS: From May 2019 to August 2019, a structured questionnaire was distributed to clinical and non-clinical HCWs at a tertiary and a general paediatric department in Denmark. Self-reported immunity was defined as either previous infection or vaccination against the disease. RESULTS: Of 619 employed HCWs, 555 (90%) were included. A large proportion were unsure of or denied previous vaccination or infection with measles (20.1%), mumps (30.2%), rubella (21.4%), varicella (12.1%), pertussis (44.1%), and diphtheria (32.1%). Non-clinical personnel and employees born in 1974–1983 had the lowest level of self-reported immunity. Mandatory vaccination of non-immune HCWs was approved by 54–68.9% of participants, and any kind of vaccination (mandatory or as an offer at hospitals) was approved of up to 95.3% of all participants depending on the disease. During the season 2018/19, 214 (38.6%) HCWs received the influenza vaccine, including 20.3% of non-clinical staff, 34.8% of nurses and 56.5% of doctors (P < 0.001). Reasons for lack of vaccine uptake were mainly employees considering themselves rarely sick, the vaccine was not regarded as necessary, forgetfulness or lack of time. Only 37.8% was in favour of mandatory influenza vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: A large proportion of paediatric HCWs were not aware of their immune status against important vaccine-preventable diseases. >90% supported vaccination of HCWs, with two out of three supporting mandatory MMR, pertussis and diphtheria vaccination.

Type I interferons (IFNs) plays a pivotal role in the innate immune response to virus infection via induction of a series of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) expression. IFN-induced transmembrane (IFITM) proteins, a group of ISGs, are important host self-restriction factors, possessing a broad spectrum of antiviral effects. They are known confer resistance to a variety of RNA and DNA viruses. However, little is known about the role of IFITMs in PRV infection. In this study, we show that IFITM is crucial for controlling PRV infection and that IFITM proteins can interfere with PRV cell binding and entry. Furthermore, we showed that IFITM2-mediated inhibition of PRV entry requires the cholesterol pathway. Collectively, these results provide insight into the anti-PRV role of IFITM proteins and this inhibition possible associated with the change of cholesterol in the endosome, further underlying the importance of cholesterol in virus infection.","Xie, Jingying; Bi, Yingjie; Xu, Shujuan; Han, Yumei; Idris, Adi; Zhang, Haixia; Li, Xiangrong; Bai, Jialin; Zhang, Yong; Feng, Ruofei",Virus Res,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2020.198105; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170220310121; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170220310121; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32745511/,415

RESULTS: 70 hospitalized COVID-19 patients were included in this study, with 39% females and median age 58 +/- 17 years. 21 patients (30%) were found to have detectable SARS-CoV-2 viral load and were classified in the viremia group. Patients with viremia were significantly older than those without viremia. 100% of viremic patients had detectable troponin during hospitalization, compared to 59% of non-viremic patients (p=0.0003). Myocardial injury was seen in 76% of viremic patients and 38% of non-viremic patients (p=0.004). CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalized COVID-19 patients with SARS-CoV-2 viremia have a significantly higher prevalence of detectable troponin and myocardial injury during their hospitalization, compared to non-viremic patients. This first report of the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 viremia, detectable troponin and myocardial injury in COVID-19 patients points to additional mechanistic pathways that require deeper study to understand the complex interplay between these unique findings, cardiovascular outcomes and mortality in COVID-19.","Siddiqi, Hasan K.; Weber, Brittany; Zhou, Guohai; Regan, James; Fajnzylber, Jesse; Coxen, Kendyll; Corry, Heather; Yu, Xu G.; DiCarli, Marcelo; Li, Jonathan Z.; Bhatt, Deepak L.",Am J Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33181107/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0002934320309335; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002934320309335?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjmed.2020.09.046,415

664411,"Socio-demographic and Clinical Characteristics of Adults with SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Two Hospitals in Bogota, Colombia",2020-08-15,"In recent years, new types of interactive analytical dashboard features have emerged for operational decision support systems (DSS). Analytical components of such features solve optimization problems hidden from the human eye, whereas interactive components involve the individual in the optimization process via graphical user interfaces (GUIs). Despite their expected value for organizations, little is known about the effectiveness of interactive analytical dashboards in operational DSS or their influences on human cognitive abilities. This paper contributes to the closing of this gap by exploring and empirically testing the effects of interactive analytical dashboard features on situation awareness (SA) and task performance in operational DSS. Using the theoretical lens of SA, we develop hypotheses about the effects of a what-if analysis as an interactive analytical dashboard feature on operational decision-makers' SA and task performance. The resulting research model is studied with a laboratory experiment, including eye-tracking data of 83 participants. Our findings show that although a what-if analysis leads to higher task performance, it may also reduce SA, nourishing a potential out-of-the-loop problem. Thus, designers and users of interactive analytical dashboards have to carefully mitigate these effects in the implementation and application of operational DSS. In this article, we translate our findings into implications for designing dashboards within operational DSS to help practitioners in their efforts to address the danger of the out-of-the-loop syndrome.","Nadj, Mario; Maedche, Alexander; Schieder, Christian",Decis Support Syst,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167923620300774?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167923620300774; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32834262/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dss.2020.113322,415
664819,"Risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection among farmworkers in Monterey County, California",2021-02-03,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 vaccine ChAdOx1 nCov-19 may rarely lead to vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT). Antibody-mediated, platelet factor 4 (PF4)-dependent platelet activation appears to resemble a key mechanism in VITT, partially comparable to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. The use of PF4/heparin immunoassays has been proposed as part of a diagnostic approach, but their sensitivity has not been established. METHODS: Sera from 12 well-defined VITT patients were first studied by two different laboratories in functional assays. Sera where then used for an interlaboratory comparison, in which five different PF4/heparin immunoassays were used by four laboratories. RESULTS: Results for functional testing were highly concordant. VITT antibodies were also reliably detected by PF4/heparin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) (92-100%). In contrast, only 25% of VITT antibodies were reactive in a particle gel immunoassay (PaGIA), and 8% in a lateral flow assay (LFA). An automated chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) was negative for all sera tested (0%). CONCLUSION: It seems feasible to establish functional antibody testing for the confirmation of VITT. For the initial screening of suspected VITT cases, PaGIA, LFA, and CLIA are useless when applied as single tests. Only ELISA-based PF4/heparin immunoassays are sensitive enough to be incorporated in the diagnostic workup. However, a combination of a positive ELISA and a negative CLIA may be useful to identify VITT antibodies in the absence of confirmatory functional assays.","Sachs, Ulrich J; Cooper, Nina; Czwalinna, Andreas; Müller, Jens; Pötzsch, Bernd; Tiede, Andreas; Althaus, Karina",Thromb. haemost,https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1535-9002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34169493/,415

Data sharing facilitates the progress of research and strengthens science. Data sharing in research is widely discussed in the literature; however, there are seemingly no evidence-based incentives that promote data sharing. METHODS: A systematic review (registration: 10.17605/OSF.IO/6PZ5E) of the health and medical research literature was used to uncover any evidence-based incentives, with pre- and post-empirical data that examined data sharing rates. We were also interested in quantifying and classifying the number of opinion pieces on the importance of incentives, the number observational studies that analysed data sharing rates and practices, and strategies aimed at increasing data sharing rates. RESULTS: Only one incentive (using open data badges) has been tested in health and medical research that examined data sharing rates. The number of opinion pieces (n = 85) out-weighed the number of article-testing strategies (n = 76), and the number of observational studies exceeded them both (n = 106). CONCLUSIONS: Given that data is the foundation of evidence-based health and medical research, it is paradoxical that there is only one evidence-based incentive to promote data sharing.

Albeit complex, the strategic public health goal is to bundle NPIs to keep the basic reproduction number R 0 below one. However, validation of these NPIs is conducted using random clinical trials, which is challenging in a swiftly moving pandemic given the need for recruiting large participant cohort over a longitudinal analysis period. This review highlights emerging innovations for potentially improving the design, functionality and improved waste management of disposable face masks such as filtering facepiece (FFPs) respirators, medical masks, and reusable face coverings to help prevent COVID-19. It describes use of different mathematical models under varying scenarios to inform efficacy of single and combined use of NPIs as important counter-measures to break the cycle of COVID-19 infection including new SARS-CoV-2 variants. Specifically, factors potentially influencing different face mask designs and functions are addressed.

Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) of human viruses can be a useful tool for population-scale monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 prevalence and epidemiology to help prevent further spread of the disease, particularly within urban centres. Here we present a longitudinal analysis (March-July, 2020) of SARS-CoV-2 RNA prevalence in sewage across six major urban centres in the UK (total population equivalent 3 million) by q(RT-)PCR and viral genome sequencing. Our results demonstrate that levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA generally correlated with the abundance of clinical cases recorded within the community in large urban centres, with a marked decline in SARS-CoV-2 RNA abundance following the implementation of lockdown measures. The strength of this association was weaker in areas with lower confirmed COVID-19 case numbers. Further sequencing analysis of SARS-CoV-2 from wastewater suggested that multiple genetically distinct clusters were co-circulating in the local populations covered by our sample sites, and that the genetic variants observed in wastewater reflected similar SNPs observed in contemporaneous samples from cases tested in clinical diagnostic laboratories. We demonstrate how WBE can be used for both community-level detection and tracking of SARS-CoV-2 and other virus’ prevalence, and can inform public health policy decisions. Although, greater understanding of the factors that affect SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration in wastewater are needed for the full integration of WBE data into outbreak surveillance. In conclusion, our results lend support to the use of routine WBE for monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 and other human pathogenic viruses circulating in the population and assessment of the effectiveness of disease control measures.","Hillary, Luke S.; Farkas, Kata; Maher, Kathryn H.; Lucaci, Anita; Thorpe, Jamie; Distaso, Marco A.; Gaze, William H.; Paterson, Steve; Burke, Terry; Connor, Thomas R.; McDonald, James E.; Malham, Shelagh K.; Jones, David L.",Water Res,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0043135421004127; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2021.117214; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34058486/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0043135421004127?v=s5,415

L’objectif de cette étude était d’identifier dans une population européenne, les facteurs de risque associés aux formes sévères. Matériels et méthodes Dans cette étude prospective non interventionnelle, nous avons inclus des patients ayant un diagnostic de COVID-19 confirmé par PCR, admis dans deux hôpitaux français au mois de mars 2020. Nous avons comparé deux groupes de patients : ceux ayant une infection non sévère et ceux ayant une infection sévère. L’infection sévère était définie par un critère composite incluant le décès ou le transfert en réanimation dans les 7jours suivants l’admission à l’hôpital. Les facteurs de risque étaient évalués à l’admission. Résultats Sur les 1045 patients inclus, 424 (41 %) ont présenté une forme sévère, dont 335 (32 %) étaient admis en réanimation, et 111 (11 %) étaient décédés. L’âge moyen était de 66±16 ans et 612 (59 %) étaient des hommes. Au total, 661 (63 %) patients avaient un indice de masse corporelle (IMC)≥25kg/m2. Les facteurs de risque associés aux formes sévères étaient l’âge avancé (odds ratio (OR)=1,1 par tranche de dix ans ; intervalle de confiance (IC) 95 % [1,0–1,2]), le sexe masculin (OR=2,1 ; IC 95 % [1,5–2,8]), un IMC compris entre 25 et 29,9kg/m2 (OR 1,8 ; IC 95 % [1,2–2,7]) ou≥30 (OR=2,2 ; IC 95 % [1,5–3,3]), la présence d’une dyspnée (OR=2,5 ; IC 95 % [1,8–3,4]), une CRP comprise entre 100 et 199mg/L (OR 1,7 ; IC 95 % [1,2–2,3]) ou≥200mg/L (OR 4,4 ; IC 95 % [2,7–6,7]), un taux de polynucléaires neutrophiles≥8000 par μL (OR 2,2 ; IC 95 % [1,5–3,0]), et un taux de lymphocytes<1000 par μL (OR 1,4 ; IC 95 % [1,1–2,0]).

A few studies were conducted investigating suicidality amid the first wave of the pandemic in Bangladesh, but none of these studies explored the predictive role of the suicidality-related factors (eg, behavior and health-related variables, COVID-19 risk, fear of COVID-19). Thus, this study aimed to investigate the prevalence of suicidality and the predictive models explaining suicidality variance among Bangladeshi young adults during the second wave of the pandemic. METHODS: An online-based cross-sectional survey was conducted during the second wave of the pandemic (between 1 and 13 April 2021; a year after the pandemic's inception in the country). The survey questionnaire collected information on socio-demographics, behavior and health-related variables, COVID-19 risk, fear of COVID-19, depression, anxiety, and suicidality. A total of 756 data were analyzed (male 59%; mean age 22.24 ±4.39 years), and hierarchical regression was performed considering suicidality as the dependent variable. A p-value <0.05 was set to be statistically significant with a 95% of confidence interval. RESULTS: About 8.2% reported having at least suicidal thoughts within the pandemic inception to survey time (one-year suicidal ideation). More specifically, 7.40% had only suicidal ideation, whereas 0.10% planned for suicide, 0.70% attempted suicide. None of the socio-demographic variables was significantly associated with suicidality. Taking drugs, performing less physical activity, poor self-reporting health condition, being comorbid, being at higher COVID-19 risk, having fear of COVID-19 infection, and suffering from depression and anxiety were significantly associated with a higher risk of suicidality. However, the final model including all of the studied variables explained a 17.1% (F=8.245, p<0.001) variance in terms of suicidality.

The cumulative effect of COVID-19 CFR in global CVD populations and the extrapolated impact on access to healthcare services in the CVD population in Canada are not fully known. This study explored the relationships of factors that may impact COVID-19 CFR and estimated the potential indirect impact of COVID-19 on Canadian healthcare resources. METHODS: Country-level epidemiological data were analyzed to study the correlation, main effect, and interaction between COVID-19 CFR and: a) proportion of the population with CVD, b) proportion of the population ≥ 65 years, and c) availability of essential health services as defined by the World Health Organization Universal Health Coverage (UHC) index. For indirect implications on healthcare resources, estimates of the volume of postponed coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and valve surgeries in Ontario were calculated.

674195,Patient Characteristics in Cases of Reinfection or Prolonged viral shedding in SARS-CoV-2,2021-05-18,"With hindsight, the main weakness behind the ineffective response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in some countries has been the failure to understand, and take account of, the multilayered systemic interdependencies that spread the effects of the pandemic across social, technological, economic and health-care dimensions. For example, to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, all people were required to rapidly adjust to social distancing and travel restrictions. Such a complex behavioural response entails adaptation to achieve a full recovery from the systemic shock. To capitalize on the positive effects of disruption to the status quo, much more complex socioeconomic modelling needs to be considered when designing and evaluating possible public health interventions that have major behavioural implications. We provide a simple example of how this reasoning may highlight generally unacknowledged connections and interdependencies and guide the construction of scenarios that can inform policy decisions to enhance the resilience of society and tackle existing societal challenges.","Sacco, Pier Luigi; De Domenico, Manlio",Bull World Health Organ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34248225/; https://doi.org/10.2471/blt.20.267757,415
674714,Comparison of the Anyplex(TM) II RV16 and Seeplex(®) RV12 ACE assays for the detection of respiratory viruses,2014-02-20,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been a pandemic worldwide. Old age and underlying illnesses are associated with poor prognosis among COVID-19 patients. However, whether frailty, a common geriatric syndrome of reduced reserve to stressors, is associated with poor prognosis among older COVID-19 patients is unknown. The aim of our study is to investigate the association between frailty and severe disease among COVID-19 patients aged ≥ 60 years. METHODS: A prospective cohort study of 114 hospitalized older patients (≥ 60 years) with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia was conducted between 7 February 2020 and 6 April 2020. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, and outcome data on admission were extracted from electronic medical records. All patients were assessed for frailty on admission using the FRAIL scale, in which five components are included: fatigue, resistance, ambulation, illnesses, and loss of weight. The outcome was the development of the severe disease within 60 days. We used the Cox proportional hazards models to identify the unadjusted and adjusted associations between frailty and severe illness. The significant variables in univariable analysis were included in the adjusted model. RESULTS: Of 114 patients, (median age, 67 years; interquartile range = 64–75 years; 57 [50%] men), 39 (34.2%), 39 (34.2%), and 36 (31.6%) were non-frail, pre-frail, and frail, respectively. During the 60 days of follow-up, 43 severe diseases occurred including eight deaths. Four of 39 (10.3%) non-frail patients, 15 of 39 (38.5%) pre-frail patients, and 24 of 36 (66.7%) frail patients progressed to severe disease. After adjustment of age, sex, body mass index, haemoglobin, white blood count, lymphocyte count, albumin, CD8+ count, D-dimer, and C-reactive protein, frailty (HR = 7.47, 95% CI 1.73–32.34, P = 0.007) and pre-frailty (HR = 5.01, 95% CI 1.16–21.61, P = 0.03) were associated with a higher hazard of severe disease than the non-frail. CONCLUSIONS: Frailty, assessed by the FRAIL scale, was associated with a higher risk of developing severe disease among older COVID-19 patients. Our findings suggested that the use of a clinician friendly assessment of frailty could help in early warning of older patients at high-risk with severe COVID-19 pneumonia.","Ma, Yao; Hou, Lisha; Yang, Xiufang; Huang, Zhixin; Yang, Xue; Zhao, Na; He, Min; Shi, Yixin; Kang, Yan; Yue, Jirong; Wu, Chenkai",BMC Med,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12916-020-01761-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32892742/,415

Surgical masks (SMs) are used by dental professionals to reduce microorganism shedding from the mouth, nose, and face of the patient. AIMS: This aim of the study is to assess the bacterial and fungal presence and their prevalence over the contaminated surgical mask in dental practice. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: This study was conducted with sample size 240 used surgical masks collected from 130 dental personnel. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional questionnaire survey was conducted with analysis involved inoculation of external and internal surfaces in an enrichment media for isolation of bacteria and fungi. Group of isolated bacteria and fungi were preliminarily identified by morphology and using Gram's stain and lacto-phenol cotton blue mediums. Data were analyzed using paired t-test; the significant level of P < 0.050. RESULTS: Microbiological analysis of samples revealed bacteria Staphylococci 26.35% as a predominant species followed by Pseudomonas 17.82% and Streptococci 15.50%. Aspergillus fungal species was also present in 6.97%. Mean ± SD of bacterial and fungal contamination on inside/outside area of the used masks was 48 ± 26 and 180 ± 110 cfu/ml/piece and 14 ± 6 and 32 ± 13 cfu/ml/piece, respectively, P < 0.001. The used surgical masks from dental department personnel working outpatient dental department had relatively higher bacterial and fungal contamination than the other dental departments. CONCLUSIONS: To reduce a load of microorganism contamination in the clinical environment, more awareness campaigns should be implemented in daily routine and air quality of dental departments should be improved with necessary protective measures.","Sachdev, Rohan; Garg, Kriti; Singh, Garima; Mehrotra, Vishal",J Family Med Prim Care,https://doi.org/10.4103/jfmpc.jfmpc_1039_19; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32318416/,415

Vaccination appears to offer the way out of this pandemic. Vaccines against this virus make use of the SARS-CoV-2's spike protein, an essential protein on the surface of the virus that it uses to attach itself to the host cells. In viral vector vaccines (AstraZeneca, Sputnik, Johnson & Johnson) the gene for the spike protein is introduced into an adenovirus. Following vaccination, the modified adenovirus will infect cells of the host, which will subsequently start to produce the spike protein, causing an immune response. RNA vaccines (Pfizer, Moderna) only introduce messenger RNA for the spike protein into host cells, which the messenger RNA uses to produce spike protein. Viral vector vaccines and RNA vaccines are not only faster to develop and safer to produce than traditional vaccines, they are also easier to modify to new viruses and virus variants. The latter may be of great importance for future pandemics.","Ligtenberg, A J M; Brand, H S",Ned. tijdschr.

Nutrition was not a priority in the intensive care unit (ICU) at the beginning of the pandemic with the need for simplified protocols. We aimed to assess the impact of a simplified nutritional protocol for critically ill COVID-19 patients during the pandemic first wave. METHODS: We included all patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections, admitted to the ICU of the Geneva University Hospitals for at least 4 days from March 9 to May 19, 2020. Data on the route and solution of nutritional therapy, prescribed and received volume, calorie and protein intake, amount of insulin, propofol and glucose administered were collected daily during the entire ICU stay. We compared nutritional outcomes between patients admitted to the ICU before and after implementing the simplified nutritional protocol using unpaired t-test. RESULTS: Out of 119 patients, 48 were hospitalized in the ICU before, 47 across and 24 after the implementation of the nutritional protocol. The mean age was 63.2 (±12.7) years and 76% were men without significant difference between before and after group. The nutritional protocol implementation led to an increase in caloric intake (1070 vs. 1357 kcal/day, p = 0.018) and in the percentage of days within 80–100% of the energy target (11 vs. 20%, p = 0.021). The protein debt decreased significantly from 48 g/day to 37 g/day (p = 0.015). No significant difference in the percentage of days within the protein target (80–100%) was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Calorie and protein coverage improved after the implementation of the simplified nutritional protocol in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Further studies are needed to assess the impact of such an approach on patients’ clinical outcomes.","de Watteville, Aude; Montalbano, Florencia; Wozniak, Hannah; Collet, Tinh-Hai; Jaksic, Cyril; Le Terrier, Christophe; Pugin, Jérôme; Genton, Laurence; Heidegger, Claudia Paula",Clin Nutr,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2021.05.024; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34134917/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0261561421002740; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561421002740?v=s5,415

The underrepresented minorities, where the prevalence of obesity is higher, appear to be affected disproportionately. Our objectives were to assess the characteristics and early outcomes of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the Bronx and investigate whether obesity is associated with worse outcomes independently from age, gender and other comorbidities. METHODS: This retrospective study included the first 200 patients admitted to a tertiary medical center with COVID-19. The electronic medical records were reviewed at least three weeks after admission. The primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: 200 patients were included (female sex: 102, African American: 102). The median BMI was 30 kg/m(2). The median age was 64 years. Hypertension (76%), hyperlipidemia (46.2%), and diabetes (39.5%) were the three most common comorbidities. Fever (86%), cough (76.5%), and dyspnea (68%) were the three most common symptoms. 24% died during hospitalization (BMI < 25 kg/m(2): 31.6%, BMI 25–34 kg/m(2): 17.2%, BMI ≥ 35 kg/m(2): 34.8%, p = 0.03). Increasing age (analyzed in quartiles), male sex, BMI ≥ 35 kg/m(2) (reference: BMI 25–34 kg/m(2)), heart failure, CAD, and CKD or ESRD were found to have a significant univariate association with mortality. The multivariate analysis demonstrated that BMI ≥ 35 kg/m(2) (reference: BMI 25–34 kg/m(2), OR: 3.78; 95% CI: 1.45–9.83; p = 0.006), male sex (OR: 2.74; 95% CI: 1.25–5.98; p = 0.011) and increasing age (analyzed in quartiles, OR: 1.73; 95% CI: 1.13–2.63; p = 0.011) were independently associated with higher in-hospital mortality. Similarly, age, male sex, BMI ≥ 35 kg/m(2) and current or prior smoking were significant predictors for increasing oxygenation requirements in the multivariate analysis, while male sex, age and BMI ≥ 35 kg/m(2) were significant predictors in the multivariate analysis for the outcome of intubation. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in a minority-predominant population, severe obesity, increasing age, and male sex were independently associated with higher in-hospital mortality and in general worse in-hospital outcomes.","Palaiodimos, Leonidas; Kokkinidis, Damianos G.; Li, Weijia; Karamanis, Dimitrios; Ognibene, Jennifer; Arora, Shitij; Southern, William N.; Mantzoros, Christos S.",Metabolism,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0026049520301268; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.metabol.2020.154262; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32422233/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0026049520301268?v=s5,415

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the underlying conditions in adults of any age that place them at risk for developing severe illness associated with COVID-19. We established an airway epithelium model to study SARS-CoV-2 infection in healthy and COPD lung cells. We found that both the entry receptor ACE2 and the co-factor transmembrane protease TMPRSS2 are expressed at higher levels on nonciliated goblet cell, a novel target for SARS-CoV-2 infection. We observed that SARS-CoV-2 infected goblet cells and induced syncytium formation and cell sloughing. We also found that SARS-CoV-2 replication was increased in the COPD airway epithelium likely due to COPD associated goblet cell hyperplasia. Our results reveal goblet cells play a critical role in SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lung.","Osan, Jaspreet K.; Talukdar, Sattya N.; Feldmann, Friederike; DeMontigny, Beth Ann; Jerome, Kailey; Bailey, Kristina L.; Feldmann, Heinz; Mehedi, Masfique",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.11.379099; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33200131/,415

There is a strong tendency to desalinate seawater from Oman or the Caspian Sea as intake seawater and transfer it to central parts of the country. These projects face significant technical, economic, and environmental challenges. In this work, utilizing available economic theories about single-stage reverse osmosis (RO) desalination plants, the cost analysis of a conceptual plant with a production capacity of 200,000 m(3)/day, was accomplished assuming the use of Oman and Caspian seawater as feed. The effect of important parameters such as applied pressure, recovery ratio, total salt content of the feed, and produced water and the temperature has been studied theoretically. The results show that under the same working conditions, the final product price per cubic meter of freshwater from the Caspian Sea is $ 0.69 versus $ 1.24 for the Oman Sea, which is about 50% cheaper. The lower salinity of the Caspian Sea compared to the Oman Sea is the main reason, which lead to reduce in the capital cost of the RO membrane (62% difference), cost of the intake and pretreatment (20%), and cost of membrane elements replacement (13%) regardless of water transfer cost.","Yusefi, Fatemeh; Zahedi, Mir Mahdi; Ziyaadini, Morteza",Appl Water Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33462558/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s13201-020-01338-5,415
679224,"4 Cases: HIV and SARS‐CoV‐2 Co‐infection in patients from Long Island, New York",2020-05-19,"BACKGROUND: Burnout is an occupational syndrome that leads to mental health problems, job turnover, and patient safety events. Those caring for critically ill patients are especially susceptible due to high patient mortality, long hours, and regular encounters with trauma and ethical issues. Interventions to prevent burnout in this population are needed. Preliminary studies suggest debriefing sessions may reduce burnout. This study aims to assess whether participation in regular debriefing can prevent burnout in intensive care unit (ICU) clinicians. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial will be conducted in two large academic medical centers. Two hundred ICU clinicians will be recruited with target enrollment of 100 physicians and 100 non-physicians (nurses, pharmacists, therapists). Participants must have worked in the ICU for the equivalent of at least 1 full time work week in the preceding 4 weeks. Enrolled subjects will be randomized to virtually attend biweekly debriefing sessions facilitated by a psychotherapist for 3 months or to a control arm without sessions. Our debriefs are modeled after Death Cafés, which are informal discussions focusing on death, dying, loss, grief, and illness. These sessions allow for reflection on distressing events and offer community and collaboration among hospital employees outside of work. The primary outcome is clinician burnout as measured by the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) Score. Secondary outcomes include depression and anxiety, as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire 8 (PHQ-8) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7), respectively. Questionnaires will be administered prior to the intervention, at 1 month, at 3 months, and at 6 months after enrollment. These values will be compared between groups temporally. Qualitative feedback will also be collected and analyzed. DISCUSSION: With ICU clinician burnout rates exceeding 50%, Death Café debriefing sessions may prove to be an effective tool to avert this debilitating syndrome. With COVID-19 limiting social interactions and overloading ICUs worldwide, the virtual administration of the Death Café for ICU clinicians provides an innovative strategy to potentially mitigate burnout in this vulnerable population.

To this end, we used a retrospective pretest-posttest design together with a latent change score model to analyze our data. From April to May of 2020, 394 Portuguese parents of students in grades 1–9 participated in this study. Our results showed that students’ anxiety and teachers’ social support, as perceived by parents, were highly significant predictors of academic motivation changes. Specifically, we found a negative effect of anxiety and a positive effect of teachers’ social support on students’ academic motivation. Our results did not show, however, a significant predictive role of classmates’ social support. This study provides an important contribution to further understand the intrapersonal and interpersonal factors that are associated with the decline of students’ academic motivation during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Many factors have been identified as risk factors for SARS-CoV-2, with much attention being paid to body mass index (BMI), but little investigation has been done to investigate dysregulation of lipid profiles and diabetes, which are often comorbid in high BMI patients. Objective This study seeks to describe the impact of BMI, HDL, LDL, ApoA, ApoB, triglycerides, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), diabetes, alcohol and red wine intake on SARS-CoV-2 risk in UK Biobank (UKB) study participants. Methods We examined the effect of BMI, lipid profiles, diabetes and alcohol intake on the risk of testing positive for SARS-Cov-2 among 9,005 UKB participants tested for SARS-CoV-2 from March 16 through June 29, 2020. Logistic regression was performed on the target variables controlling for age, sex and ancestry. Results BMI, Type II diabetes and HbA1c were associated with increased SARS-CoV-2 risk (p < 0.05) while HDL and ApoA were associated with decreased risk (p < 0.001). Additionally, red wine intake was associated with reduced SARS-CoV-2 risk (p < 0.05). LDL, ApoB and triglyceride levels were not found to be significantly associated with increased risk. Conclusion Elevated HDL and ApoA levels and alcohol intake, specifically red wine intake, were associated with reduced risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, while type II diabetes and HbA1c were associated with increased risk. The effects of alcohol, type II diabetes and HbA1c levels may be indirect, mediated in part through regulation of HDL levels. In summary, our study corroborates the emerging picture that high HDL levels may confer protection against SARS-CoV-2.","Scalsky, R. J.; Desai, K.; Chen, Y.-J.; O'Connell, J. R.; Perry, J.

Method: In this retrospective cohort study, patients who were diagnosed with DED by an ophthalmologist and whose Schirmer test was less than 5 mm were identified. Patients who missed follow-up examinations, patients with malignancy, Human Immunodeficiency Virus patients and patients having undergone bone marrow transplantation were excluded. Among the DED patients, patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests were identified on October 11, 2020. Subsequently, patients were divided into four age groups (25-49; 50-64; 65-79; and 80+). The COVID-19 prevalence per 100,000 people was determined for each age group, and risk analysis was performed by comparing this with the general population in Turkey. Results: 10,023 DED patients were identified and included in the study. Among these, the PCR test was positive in 359 patients. The COVID-19 prevalence per 100,000 population in DED patients was calculated as 3,581.7, while according to the Ministry of Health data, it was 524.7 in the general Turkish population. The odds ratio of DED patients versus the general population was 6.62 (p<0.001) (7.66 in the 25-49 group; 6.59 in the 50-64 group; 6.23 in the 65-79 group; and 7.24 in the 80+ age group).

This anti-fTNF-alpha mAb 2–4 was confirmed to inhibit the following fTNF-alpha-induced conditions in vitro. In the present study, we investigated whether mAb 2–4 improved the FIP symptoms and survival rate of experimentally FIPV-inoculated SPF cats. Progression to FIP was prevented in 2 out of 3 cats treated with mAb 2–4, whereas all 3 cats developed FIP in the placebo control group. Plasma alpha1-glycoprotein and vascular endothelial growth factor levels were improved by the administration of mAb 2–4, and the peripheral lymphocyte count also recovered.

Subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) has been used to monitor active replication. Given the importance of long RT-PCR positivity and the need for work reincorporation and discontinuing isolation, we studied the functionality of normalized viral loads (NVL) for patient monitoring and sgRNA for viral infectivity detection. METHODS: NVL measured through the Nucleocapsid and RNA-dependent-RNA-polymerase genes and sgRNA RT-PCRs were performed in 2 consecutive swabs from 84 health-care workers. RESULTS: NVL provided similar and accurate quantities of both genes of SARS-CoV-2 at two different time-points of infection, overcoming Ct-value and swab collection variability. Among SARS-CoV-2-positive samples, 51.19% were sgRNA-positive in the 1 (st)RT-PCR and 5.95% in the 2 (nd)RT-PCR. All sgRNA-positive samples had >4log(10)RNAcopies/1000cells, while samples with ≤1log(10) NVL were sgRNA-negative. Although NVL were positive until 29 days after symptom onset, 84.1% of sgRNA-positive samples were from the first 7 days, which correlated with viral culture viability. Multivariate analyses showed that sgRNA, NVL and days of symptoms were significantly associated (p<0.001) CONCLUSIONS: NVL and sgRNA are two rapid accessible techniques that could be easily implemented in routine hospital practice providing a useful proxy for viral infectivity and COVID-19 patient follow-up.","Santos Bravo, Marta; Nicolás, David; Berengua, Carla; Fernandez, Mariana; Hurtado, Juan Carlos; Tortajada, Marta; Barroso, Sonia; Vilella, Anna; Mosquera, Mar; Vila, Jordi; Marcos, María Angeles",J Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34329473/; https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiab394,415

We aimed to study whether there is risk of incident depression, suicidal ideation or psychosis associated with HCQ as used for RA. METHODS: We performed a new-user cohort study using claims and electronic medical records from 10 sources and 3 countries (Germany, UK and USA). RA patients ≥18 years of age and initiating HCQ were compared with those initiating SSZ (active comparator) and followed up in the short (30 days) and long term (on treatment). Study outcomes included depression, suicide/suicidal ideation and hospitalization for psychosis. Propensity score stratification and calibration using negative control outcomes were used to address confounding. Cox models were fitted to estimate database-specific calibrated hazard ratios (HRs), with estimates pooled where I(2) <40%. RESULTS: A total of 918 144 and 290 383 users of HCQ and SSZ, respectively, were included. No consistent risk of psychiatric events was observed with short-term HCQ (compared with SSZ) use, with meta-analytic HRs of 0.96 (95% CI 0.79, 1.16) for depression, 0.94 (95% CI 0.49, 1.77) for suicide/suicidal ideation and 1.03 (95% CI 0.66, 1.60) for psychosis. No consistent long-term risk was seen, with meta-analytic HRs of 0.94 (95% CI 0.71, 1.26) for depression, 0.77 (95% CI 0.56, 1.07) for suicide/suicidal ideation and 0.99 (95% CI 0.72, 1.35) for psychosis. CONCLUSION: HCQ as used to treat RA does not appear to increase the risk of depression, suicide/suicidal ideation or psychosis compared with SSZ. No effects were seen in the short or long term.

Therefore, the intention to get vaccinated is a critical issue for nursing students because they will act as health care providers and educators due to their future profession. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to explore factors associated with COVID-19 vaccination intention among Chinese nursing students. DESIGN: A cross-sectional online survey was used. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1070 Chinese nursing students participated in this study. METHODS: The study used structured self-administered questionnaires to assess the effects of the following elements; sociodemographic factors, vaccination status, beliefs on general vaccination, beliefs and attitudes towards COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccination, and COVID-19 vaccination intention. Hierarchical regression analysis was conducted to examine the relationship between these variables and COVID-19 vaccination intention. RESULTS: More than half (51.9%) of nursing students were willing to vaccinate against COVID-19, while 43.4% were uncertain and 4.7% were unwilling to get vaccinated. Increased likelihood of intention to get vaccinated was associated with positive beliefs towards general vaccination and COVID-19 vaccination, perceived less adverse effects following vaccination, the greater impact of COVID-19 on daily life, and less clinical practice experience in healthcare settings. Those hesitant to vaccinate raised concerns about the safety of vaccines, doubted the efficacy, believed that vaccination was unnecessary, or had insufficient information on COVID-19 vaccines. CONCLUSIONS: More efforts are needed to enhance vaccine confidence and increase the vaccination rates against COVID-19 in nursing students by organizing effective educational campaigns and establishing positive vaccination beliefs.","Zhou, Ying; Wang, Yidan; Li, Zheng",Nurse Educ Today,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0260691721004093?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nedt.2021.105152; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34600184/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0260691721004093,415

Like in SARS-CoV, horseshoe bats currently represent the most likely candidate animal source for SARS-CoV-2. Yet, the specific mechanisms of cross-species transmission and adaptation to the human host remain unknown. Here we show that the unsupervised analysis of conservation patterns across the β-CoV spike protein family, using sequence information alone, can provide rich information on the molecular basis of the specificity of β-CoVs to different host cell receptors. More precisely, our results indicate that host cell receptor usage is encoded in the amino acid sequences of different CoV spike proteins in the form of a set of specificity determining positions (SDPs). Furthermore, by integrating structural data, in silico mutagenesis and coevolution analysis we could elucidate the role of SDPs in mediating ACE2 binding across the Sarbecovirus lineage, either by engaging the receptor through direct intermolecular interactions or by affecting the local environment of the receptor binding motif. Finally, by the analysis of coevolving mutations across a paired MSA we were able to identify key intermolecular contacts occurring at the spike-ACE2 interface. These results show that effective mining of the evolutionary records held in the sequence of the spike protein family can help tracing the molecular mechanisms behind the evolution and host-receptors adaptation of circulating and future novel β-CoVs. Significance Unraveling the molecular basis for host cell receptor usage among β-CoVs is crucial to our understanding of cross-species transmission, adaptation and for molecular-guided epidemiological monitoring of potential outbreaks. In the present study, we survey the sequence conservation patterns of the β-CoV spike protein family to identify the evolutionary constraints shaping the functional specificity of the protein across the β-CoV lineage. We show that the unsupervised analysis of statistical patterns in a MSA of the spike protein family can help tracing the amino acid space encoding the specificity of β-CoVs to their cognate host cell receptors. We argue that the results obtained in this work can provide a framework for monitoring the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 specificity to the hACE2 receptor, as the virus continues spreading in the human population and differential virulence starts to arise.","Pontes, Camila; Ruiz-Serra, Victoria; Lepore, Rosalba; Valencia, Alfonso",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.21.260745,415

The disease originated in Africa has spread to Europe, Asia and Oceania, since 2007, reaching a pandemic dimension. Currently, the spread of ASF is unstoppable and that the development of a safe and effective vaccine is urgently required. The objective of this paper is to review the vaccine candidates tested during the 20th and 21st centuries, to identify the strengths and weaknesses of these studies and to highlight what we should learn. Several strategies have been explored to date, some of which have shown positive and negative results. Inactivated preparations and subunit vaccines are not a viable option. The most promising strategy would appear to be live attenuated vaccines, because these vaccine candidates are able to induce variable percentages of protection against certain homologous and heterologous virus isolates. The number of studies on live attenuated vaccine candidates has steadily increased in the 21st century thanks to advances in molecular biology and an in-depth knowledge of ASF virus, which have allowed the development of vaccines based on deletion mutants. The deletion of virulence-related genes has proved to be a useful tool for attenuation, although attenuation does not always mean protection and even less, cross protection. Therefore, ASF vaccine development has proved to be one of the top priorities in ASF research. Efforts are still being made to fill the gaps in the knowledge regarding immune response, safety and cross protection, and these efforts will hopefully help to find a safe and effective vaccine that could be commercialised soon, thus making it possible to turn a dream into reality.","Muñoz-Pérez, Carolina; Jurado, Cristina; Sánchez-Vizcaíno, José Manuel",Transbound Emerg Dis,https://doi.org/10.1111/tbed.14191; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34137198/,415

686782,Acute transverse myelitis following SARS-CoV-2 infection(),2021-07-22,"IFNL4, a recently discovered member of the interferon λ family (IFNλs or type III IFNs), is a pseudogene in a significant fraction of the human population. A single nucleotide polymorphism located in IFNL4, which determines the ability to express IFNλ4, has been correlated with poor spontaneous and treatment-induced clearance of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections. We show that IFNλ4 is an active type III IFN that induces a typical subset of ISGs, signals through the classical type III IFN receptor complex and is antiviral against HCV and coronaviruses. However, its secretion is impaired and this impairment is caused by a yet unknown molecular determinant, but appears to be partially caused by a weak signal peptide and inefficient N-linked glycosylation. This glycosylation is not required for antiviral activity and secretion of IFNλ4, but seems to improve its processing. The impaired secretion of IFNλ4 appears to be a recently acquired feature of primates. A single amino acid substitution in IFNλ4 changing a proline at position 70 to a serine (P70S) alters its activity. We demonstrate that the IFNλ4-S70 variant has a significantly lower antiviral activity compared to IFNλ4-P70. Our subsequent genetic study on a cohort of patients infected with HCV shows that individuals, who encode IFNλ4-S70, display lower hepatic ISG expression, better treatment response rates and better spontaneous clearance rates than patients encoding IFNλ4-P70. This study provides important evidence supporting a role for active IFNλ4 as the driver of high hepatic ISG expression as well as the cause of poor HCV clearance.","Terczynska-Dyla, Ewa; Bibert, Stephanie; Duong, Francois H.T.; Lauber, Chris; Gad, Hans Henrik; Kaderali, Lars; Heim, Markus H.; Bochud, Pierre-Yves; Hartmann, Rune",Cytokine,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043466615003944; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1043466615003944,415

A future vision of the use of systems medicine in healthcare served as a stimulus for the discussion. The results show that although certain aspects of systems medicine were seen positive (e.g., use of smart technology, digitalization, and networking in healthcare), the perceived risks dominated. The high degree of technification was perceived as emotionally burdensome (e.g., reduction of people to their data, loss of control, dehumanization). The risk-benefit balance for the use of risk-prediction models for disease events and trajectories was rated as rather negative.

The major bottleneck in leveraging testing capacity has been the lack of diagnostic resources. Pooled testing is a potential approach that could reduce cost and usage of test kits. This method involves pooling individual samples and testing them ‘en bloc’. Only if the pool tests positive, retesting of individual samples is performed.

688945,Severe sinus bradycardia associated with Remdesivir in a child with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection,2021-01-23,"To prevent diarrhea in suckling piglets infected by porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) vaccines are administered mainly through intramuscular (IM) or oral routes. We found that growing pigs vaccinated with an inactivated PEDV vaccine via the intradermal (ID) route had higher neutralizing antibody titers and cytokine (IFN-γ, IL-4, and IL-10) levels than non-vaccinated pigs. In addition, suckling piglets acquired lactogenic immunity from pregnant sows inoculated with an ID PED vaccine. We evaluated the efficacy of vaccination via this route, along with subsequent protection against virulent PEDV. At six days post-challenge, the survival rate of suckling piglets exposed to virulent PEDV was 70% for the ID group and 0% for the mock group (no vaccine). At necropsy, villi length in the duodenum and ileum of piglets with lactogenic immunity provided by ID-vaccinated sows proved to be significant (p < 0.05) when compared with those in piglets from mock group sows. Thus, vaccination using an inactivated PED vaccine via the ID route provides partial protection against infection by virulent PEDV.","Choe, SeEun; Park, Gyu-Nam; Song, Sok; Shin, Jihye; Le, Van Phan; Nguyen, Van Giap; Kim, Ki-Sun; Kim, Hye Kwon; Hyun, Bang-Hun; An, Dong-Jun",Pathogens,https://doi.org/10.3390/pathogens10091115; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34578148/,415
689173,Cross-sectional assessment of SARS-CoV-2 viral load by symptom status in Massachusetts congregate living facilities,2021-07-13,"In December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), officially known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. Cytokine storm is an uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response resulting from the release of large amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines that occurs at phase 3 of viral infection. Such emergence led to the development of many clinical trials to discover efficient drugs and therapeutic protocols to fight with this single-stranded RNA virus. Corticosteroids suppress inflammation of the lungs during the cytokine storm, weaken immune responses, and inhibit the elimination of pathogen. For this reason, in COVID-19 corticosteroid therapy, systemic inhibition of inflammation is observed with a wide range of side effects. The present review discusses the effectiveness of the corticosteroid application in COVID-19 infection and the related side effects of these agents. In summary, a number of corticosteroids, including and especially methylprednisolone and dexamethasone, have demonstrated remarkable efficacy, particularly for COVID-19 patients who underwent mechanical ventilation.","Langarizadeh, Mohammad Amin; Ranjbar Tavakoli, Marziye; Abiri, Ardavan; Ghasempour, Ali; Rezaei, Masoud; Ameri, Alieh",EXCLI J,https://doi.org/10.17179/excli2020-3196; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33746666/,415
689320,SARS-CoV-2 infection in children with febrile neutropenia,2020-06-12,"BACKGROUND: The risk of pulmonary embolism (PE) in patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is recognized. The prevalence of PE in patients with respiratory deterioration at the Emergency Department (ED), the regular ward, and the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) are not well-established. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate how often PE was present in individuals with COVID-19 and respiratory deterioration in different settings, and whether or not disease severity as measured by CT-severity score (CTSS) was related to the occurrence of PE. PATIENTS/METHODS: Between April 6th and May 3rd, we enrolled 60 consecutive adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 from the ED, regular ward and ICU who met the pre-specified criteria for respiratory deterioration. RESULTS: A total of 24 (24/60: 40% (95% CI: 28–54%)) patients were diagnosed with PE, of whom 6 were in the ED (6/23: 26% (95% CI: 10–46%)), 8 in the regular ward (8/24: 33% (95% CI: 16–55%)), and 10 in the ICU (10/13: 77% (95% CI: 46–95%)). CTSS (per unit) was not associated with the occurrence of PE (age and sex-adjusted OR 1.06 (95%CI 0.98–1.15)). CONCLUSION: The number of PE diagnosis among patients with COVID-19 and respiratory deterioration was high; 26% in the ED, 33% in the regular ward and 77% in the ICU respectively. In our cohort CTSS was not associated with the occurrence of PE. Based on the high number of patients diagnosed with PE among those scanned we recommend a low threshold for performing computed tomography angiography in patients with COVID-19 and respiratory deterioration.","Brüggemann, Renée A.G.; Spaetgens, Bart; Gietema, Hester A.; Brouns, Steffie H.A.; Stassen, Patricia M.; Magdelijns, Fabienne J.; Rennenberg, Roger J.; Henry, Ronald M.A.; Mulder, Mark M.G.; van Bussel, Bas C.T.; Schnabel, Ronny M.; van der Horst, Iwan C.C.; Wildberger, Joachim E.; Stehouwer, Coen D.A.; ten Cate, Hugo",Thromb Res,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0049384820305569; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0049384820305569?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.thromres.2020.10.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33091701/,415

689591,Serum magnesium levels in hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2,2021-09-26,"The results presented here demonstrate that the MHV and SARS-CoV nsp2 proteins are not required for the production of infectious virus, for polyprotein expression or processing, or for viral replication complex formation in cell culture. The nsp2 protein domain resides in a region of the coronavirus replicase that is relatively nonconserved across coronaviruses. In fact, the size and amino acid sequence variability of nsp2 across the different coronaviruses has led some investigators to speculate that the nsp2 protein, along with the nsp1 and nsp3 proteins, may play host- and/or cell-specific roles in the virus life cycle. While this may be the case, it should be noted that nsp2, in some form, exists in all coronaviruses studied to date and likely plays a pivotal role in the viral life cycle. A previous study from our laboratory identified a coronavirus replicase protein that plays an important role in viral pathogenesis. Such may prove to be the case for nsp2, as well. Alternatively, beacuse nsp2 exists as a detectable precursor protein nsp2-3 prior to processing of nsp2 and nsp3 into mature proteins, nsp2 may play a critical adaptor/regulatory role for nsp3 function. Importantly, the viruses produced in this study provide a system by which the role of the nsp2 protein in viral infection can be characterized.","Graham, Rachel L.; Sims, Amy C.; Baric, Ralph S.; Denison, Mark R.",The Nidoviruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17037506/,415
689690,Inter‐rater reliability and prospective validation of a clinical prediction rule for SARS‐CoV‐2 infection,2021-06-21,"Intensive exploitation, poor recycling, low repeatable use, and unusual resistance of plastics to environmental and microbiological action result in accumulation of huge waste amounts in terrestrial and marine environments, causing enormous hazard for human and animal life. In the last decades, much scientific interest has been focused on plastic biodegradation. Due to the comparatively short evolutionary period of their appearance in nature, sufficiently effective enzymes for their biodegradation are not available. Plastics are designed for use in conditions typical for human activity, and their physicochemical properties roughly change at extreme environmental parameters like low temperatures, salt, or low or high pH that are typical for the life of extremophilic microorganisms and the activity of their enzymes. This review represents a first attempt to summarize the extraordinarily limited information on biodegradation of conventional synthetic plastics by thermophilic, alkaliphilic, halophilic, and psychrophilic bacteria in natural environments and laboratory conditions. Most of the available data was reported in the last several years and concerns moderate extremophiles. Two main questions are highlighted in it: which extremophilic bacteria and their enzymes are reported to be involved in the degradation of different synthetic plastics, and what could be the impact of extremophiles in future technologies for resolving of pollution problems.","Atanasova, Nikolina; Stoitsova, Stoyanka; Paunova-Krasteva, Tsvetelina; Kambourova, Margarita",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34070607/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22115610,415
689882,Coagulopathy and mesenteric ischaemia in severe SARS‐CoV‐2 infection,2020-07-13,"COVID‐19 (coronavirus disease 2019) represents a prothrombotic disorder, and there have been several reports of platelet factor 4/heparin antibodies being present in COVID‐19‐infected patients. This has thus been identified in some publications as representing a high incidence of heparin‐induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), whereas in others, findings have been tempered by general lack of functional reactivity using confirmation assays of serotonin release assay (SRA) or heparin‐induced platelet aggregation (HIPA). Moreover, in at least two publications, data are provided suggesting that antibodies can arise in heparin naïve patients or that platelet activation may not be heparin‐dependent. From this literature, we would conclude that platelet factor 4/heparin antibodies can be observed in COVID‐19‐infected patients, and they may occur at higher incidence than in historical non‐COVID‐19‐infected cohorts. However, the situation is complex, since not all platelet factor 4/heparin antibodies may lead to platelet activation, and not all identified antibodies are heparin‐dependent, such that they do not necessarily reflect “true” HIT. Most recently, a “HIT‐like” syndrome has reported in patients who have been vaccinated against COVID‐19. Accordingly, much more is yet to be learnt about the insidious disease that COVID‐19 represents, including autoimmune outcomes in affected patients.","Favaloro, Emmanuel J.; Henry, Brandon Michael; Lippi, Giuseppe",Int J Lab Hematol,https://doi.org/10.1111/ijlh.13582; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34000089/,415

H(2)O, MeCN, 55–60 °C), which, according to the previous finding, might involve the addition of OH and NH-functions to the triple bond and insertion of acylacetylenes into the quinoline scaffold, retains mainly on the formation of chalcone-quinoline ensembles in up 99% yield. The higher functionalized quinolines can be obtained in a synthetically acceptable yield, when the above ensembles are treated with the second molecule of acylacetylenes. Thus, the further insertion of second molecule of the acetylenes into the quinoline scaffold occurs as a much slower process indicating a strong adverse substituent effect of the remote chalcone moiety.","Belyaeva, Kseniya V.; Nikitina, Lina P.; Afonin, Andrei V.; Trofimov, Boris A.",Tetrahedron,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004040202030716X?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tet.2020.131523; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S004040202030716X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32839627/,415
690261,Small Airways Disease is a Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 Infection,2021-05-30,"BACKGROUND: Many studies have been carried out in modelling COVID-19 pandemic. However, region-wise average duration of recovery from COVID-19 has not been attempted; hence, an effort has been made to estimate state-wise recovery duration of India's COVID-19 patients. Determining the recovery time in each region is intended to assist healthcare professionals in providing better care and planning of logistics. METHODS: This study used database provided by Kaggle, which takes data from the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare. The simple Linear Regression model between incidence, prevalence, and duration was used to assess the duration of COVID-19 disease in various Indian states. RESULTS: The fitted model suits ideal for most of the states, except for some union territories and northeastern states. The average time to recover from disease was ranging from 5 to 36 days in Indian states/union territories except for Madhya Pradesh. Tamil Nadu has an average recovery time of 7 days with an value of 0.96, followed by Odisha, Karnataka, West Bengal, Kerala and Chhattisgarh and the average recovery duration was estimated as 7, 13, 17, 11, 14 and 12 days respectively. CONCLUSION: The average recovery from COVID-19 was ten or less days in twenty percentage of states, whereas in forty-four percentage of states/union territories had an average recovery duration between ten to twenty days. However, around twentyfour percentage of states/union territory recovered between twenty to thirty days. In the rest of Indian states/union territories, the average duration of recovery was more than thirty days.","George, Noel; Tyagi, Naresh K.; Prasad, Jang Bahadur",Clin Epidemiol Glob Health,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213398421000440?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2213398421000440; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cegh.2021.100740; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33875974/,415

AIM: This systematic review summarizes the current scientific evidence regarding the clinical presentation of COVID-19 in hospitalized children based on available case series from China. In addition, first data from a nationwide pediatric hospital survey conducted by the German Society for Pediatric Infectious Diseases (DGPI) are presented. METHODS: This study evaluated 12 case series from China with 6–2143 children infected with SARS-CoV‑2, which were identified by a literature search in PubMed up to 31 March 2020. The database of the German nationwide DGPI COVID-19 survey was accessed on 6 April 2020. RESULTS: The median patient age in the case series was between 2 and 7 years and 18–45% were infants <1 year of age. The duration of hospital stay was 5–20 days. Most commonly reported symptoms were fever and cough; in 40–100% of cases involvement of the lower respiratory tract was reported, usually confirmed by computed tomography (CT). Severe and critical courses of disease were reported in up to 8% of the children including 2 fatalities. So far the German DGPI COVID-19 survey reported 33 hospitalized children up to 6 April 2020, mostly with upper airway infections. Of these children, 45% were infants and 32% had an underlying medical condition. So far 3 children (9%) needed admission to an intensive care unit. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 in hospitalized children usually presented as an uncomplicated febrile upper airway infection or mild pneumonia. Severe cases or fatalities rarely occurred in children. Information on neonates and children with underlying chronic conditions as well as on therapeutic and preventive measures are urgently needed.","Streng, A.; Hartmann, K.; Armann, J.; Berner, R.; Liese, J.
