66340,Pharmacy Department management and organization.,2020-06-12,"PURPOSE To assess a classification scheme for predicting local tumor progression (LTP) after radiofrequency (RF) ablation of liver metastases, using predefined patterns on contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography (PET) combined with CT (PET/CT) acquired 24 hours after RF ablation. MATERIALS AND METHODS There were 45 metastases in 20 patients treated. After 24 hours, imaging of the ablation zones was performed with contrast-enhanced PET/CT. Three independent radiologists prospectively assessed contrast-enhanced CT and combined PET/CT images to identify three patterns: pattern I, no tissue enhancement or fluorodeoxyglucose uptake between the ablation zone and the liver parenchyma; pattern II, a rimlike pattern; and pattern III, a peripheral nodule. PET/CT images obtained after 8-10 weeks were evaluated for LTP. The patterns were analyzed for their sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for predicting LTP. RESULTS Pattern I was most frequently observed (81% for contrast-enhanced CT and 61% for PET/CT) as well as for ablation zones that showed LTP (52% and 37%, respectively). Conversely, pattern II was observed for tumors that were completely ablated (6% and 29%, respectively). Patterns II and III together had the highest sensitivity for predicting LTP (48% and 63%, respectively); pattern III had the highest specificity (94% and 95%, respectively). For nodular patterns, test characteristics were better for PET/CT compared with contrast-enhanced CT, but the difference was not significant. Nodular patterns > 1 cm achieved high positive predictive value (both 100%). CONCLUSIONS Inflammation and hyperemia can hinder interpretation on imaging 24 hours after RF ablation, especially on PET/CT. Nodular patterns around the ablation zone on early contrast-enhanced CT and PET/CT have a high predictive value for LTP and should be taken into account for disease management.","Vandenbroucke, Frederik; Vandemeulebroucke, Jef; Ilsen, Bart; Verdries, Douwe; Belsack, Dries; Everaert, Hendrik; Buls, Nico; Ros, Pablo R; de Mey, Johan",Journal of vascular and interventional radiology : JVIR,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvir.2014.04.020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24954606/,875
69609,Hospital Pharmacy Service: Facing the logistics of medicines procurement.,2020-06-12,"As well as the exploration of translatable delivery nanosystems for cancer therapeutic agents, the development of automatable continuous-flow manufacture technology comprising digitally controlled reactions for the on-demand production of pharmaceuticals is an important challenge in anticancer nanomedicine. Most attempts to resolve these issues have involved the development of alternative reactions, formulations, or constructs containing stimulus components aimed at producing multiple approaches for highly efficacious combination cancer therapies. However, there has been no report of a platform based on plug-in execution that enables continuous-flow manufacture in a compact, reconfigurable manner, although an optimal platform technology may be a prerequisite for the timely translation of recently developed nanomedicines. To this end, we describe the development of a platform toward digitizable, continuous manufacture by serial combination of plug-in reactionwares (heating plates, a spraying cup, and a photochamber) for single-pass flow fabrication. Specifically, we fabricated three different composite nanoblocks consisting of Au1Ag9 (<8 nanometers; stimulus component), docetaxel (an anticancer drug), and bovine serum albumin (a protective and targeting agent) using our system, with the result of producing nanoblocks with photothermally modulatable and structurally disintegratable properties. These were examined for effectiveness in near-infrared-induced chemothermal cancer therapy and renal excretion of Au1Ag9 particles, and exhibited high anticancer efficacy and warrantable biosafety.","Poudel, Kishwor; Park, Sungjae; Hwang, Jungho; Ku, Sae Kwang; Yong, Chul Soon; Kim, Jong Oh; Byeon, Jeong Hoon",ACS nano,https://doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.9b09731; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32816451/,875

Telepharmacy.,2020-06-13,"PURPOSE To investigate the validity of determining the contrast medium dose based on body surface area (BSA) for the abdominal contrast-enhanced multi-detector row CT comparing with determining based on body weight (BW). MATERIALS AND METHODS Institutional review committee approval was obtained. In this retrospective study, 191 patients those underwent abdominal contrast-enhanced multi-detector row CT were enrolled. All patients received 96 mL of 320 mg I/mL contrast medium at the rate of 3.2 mL. The iodine dose required to enhance 1 HU of the aorta at the arterial phase and that of liver parenchyma at portal venous phase per BSA were calculated (EUBSA) and evaluated the relationship with BSA. Those per BW were also calculated (EUBW) and evaluated. Estimated enhancement values (EEVs) of the aorta and liver parenchyma with two protocols for dose decision based on BSA and BW were calculated and patient-to-patient variability was compared between two protocols using the Levene test. RESULTS The mean of EUBSA and EUBW were 0.0621 g I/m2/HU and 0.00178 g I/kg/HU for the aorta, and 0.342 g I/m2/HU and 0.00978 g I/kg/HU for the liver parenchyma, respectively. In the aortic enhancement, EUBSA was almost constant regardless of BSA, and the mean absolute deviation of the EEV with the BSA protocol was significantly lower than that with the BW protocol (P<.001), although there was no significant difference between two protocols in the hepatic parenchymal enhancement (P=.92). CONCLUSION For the aortic enhancement, determining the contrast medium dose based on BSA was considered to improve patient-to-patient enhancement variability.","Onishi, Hiromitsu; Murakami, Takamichi; Kim, Tonsok; Hori, Masatoshi; Osuga, Keigo; Tatsumi, Mitsuaki; Higashihara, Hiroki; Maeda, Noboru; Tsuboyama, Takahiro; Nakamoto, Atsushi; Tomoda, Kaname; Tomiyama, Noriyuki",European journal of radiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrad.2010.08.037; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20864283/,875
89898,[Cidofovir dosage in a critically ill patient undergoing continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration].,2014,"Network embedding techniques are powerful to capture structural regularities in networks and to identify similarities between their local fabrics. However, conventional network embedding models are developed for static structures, commonly consider nodes only and they are seriously challenged when the network is varying in time. Temporal networks may provide an advantage in the description of real systems, but they code more complex information, which could be effectively represented only by a handful of methods so far. Here, we propose a new method of event embedding of temporal networks, called weg2vec, which builds on temporal and structural similarities of events to learn a low dimensional representation of a temporal network. This projection successfully captures latent structures and similarities between events involving different nodes at different times and provides ways to predict the final outcome of spreading processes unfolding on the temporal structure.","Torricelli, Maddalena; Karsai, MÃ¡rton; Gauvin, Laetitia",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-63221-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346033/,875

122357,Observational multicentre prospective study to assess changes in cognitive function in patients treated with PCSK9i. Study protocol.,2021-03-05,"The scaling down of meta-atoms or metamolecules (collectively denoted as metaunits) is a long-lasting issue from the time when the concept of metamaterials was first suggested. According to the effective medium theory, which is the foundational concept of metamaterials, the structural sizes of meta-units should be much smaller than the working wavelengths (e.g., << 1/5 wavelength). At relatively low frequency regimes (e.g., microwave and terahertz), the conventional monolithic lithography can readily address the materialization of metamaterials. However, it is still challenging to fabricate optical metamaterials (metamaterials working at optical frequencies such as the visible and near-infrared regimes) through the lithographic approaches. This serves as the rationale for using colloidal self-assembly as a strategy for the realization of optical metamaterials. Colloidal self-assembly can address various critical issues associated with the materialization of optical metamaterials, such as achieving nanogaps over a large area, increasing true 3D structural complexities, and cost-effective processing, which all are difficult to attain through monolithic lithography. Nevertheless, colloidal self-assembly is still a toolset underutilized by optical engineers. Here, the design principle of the colloidally self-assembled optical metamaterials exhibiting unnatural refractions, the practical challenge of relevant experiments, and the future opportunities are critically reviewed.","Huh, Ji-Hyeok; Kim, Kwangjin; Im, Eunji; Lee, Jaewon; Cho, YongDeok; Lee, Seungwoo",Advanced materials,https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202001806; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33079414/,875
137074,Hospital Pharmacy: Comprehensive management of medical devices during SARS-CoV-2.,2020-06-12,"The rapid spread and huge impact of the COVID-19 pandemic caused by the emerging SARS-CoV-2 have driven large efforts for sequencing and analyzing the viral genomes. Mutation analyses have revealed that the virus keeps mutating and shows a certain degree of genetic diversity, which could result in the alteration of its infectivity and pathogenicity. Therefore, appropriate delineation of SARS-CoV-2 genetic variants enables us to understand its evolution and transmission patterns. By focusing on the nucleotides that co-substituted, we first identified 42 co-mutation modules that consist of at least two co-substituted nucleotides during the SARS-CoV-2 evolution. Then based on these co-mutation modules, we classified the SARS-CoV-2 population into 43 groups and further identified the phylogenetic relationships among groups based on the number of inconsistent co-mutation modules, which were validated with phylogenetic trees. Intuitively, we tracked tempo-spatial patterns of the 43 groups, of which 11 groups were geographic-specific. Different epidemic periods showed specific co-circulating groups, where the dominant groups existed and had multiple sub-groups of parallel evolution. Our work enables us to capture the evolution and transmission patterns of SARS-CoV-2, which can contribute to guiding the prevention and control of the COVID-19 pandemic.

366056,Es el momento de revisar cÃ³mo se preparan y administran los medicamentos inyectables en los hospitales europeos,2021,"The neoliberal capitalism exceeded the sustainable boundaries of biotopes, generating eco-systemic dysfunctionalities, and deconstructing agri-food systems. In front of such scenario, agroecology emerges as analysis field, because of its codification, as a concept of the UN-FAO international system, to implement a worldwide agenda for development and food security. This aims to generate a social rhizome by innumerable local actors who seek to re-convert the conventional agri-food system into an agro ecological system. The latest exposed the need to analyze the agroecology's semantic as a modernity story in front of two possible paths: Become a decolonizing semantics and representative of a contestatory social grammar or become in an uprooted and depoliticized version of an agri-food extractivist mainstream violator of rights. Given this, is possible that agroecology manages to ""scrap"" the neoliberal agriculture epistemology and propose a more promising alternative? Problems, as the COVID-19, exposed the high fragility of the global agri food systems, thus the immediately urgency to look for concrete answers. To do this, conceptual superlatives present in agroecological researchs were analyzed as part of different agroecology semantics expressed, along the decade 2010-2020, and as a bounded sample of agroecological thinking in Latin America.

Rwanda has made notable efforts to fight the pandemic. However, the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the country's economy are numerous and the refugees residing in Rwanda are not spared these effects. As of December 2020, 164,000 people were granted refugee status in Rwanda according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). The majority were from neighbouring countries in the Great Lakes regions, including DRC (Democratic Republic of Congo) and Burundi. The impact the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy has led to a decline in donations to the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP), which in turn has significantly reduced the food rations of refugees. Such paucity will no doubt cause unprecedented impacts on the people residing in refugee camps, who completely depend on humanitarian aid to meet their basic food requirements. This lack of access to adequate and affordable food will expose refugees to extreme hunger and starvation, putting their lives in danger by triggering forced returns, infections, social conflicts and thus higher morbidity and mortality.Furthermore, such stressful environments would no doubt put the mental health of these already vulnerable communities at risk. It is unsurprising that refugees are more likely to experience poor mental health compared to local population, including higher rates of depression and anxiety disorders including Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). This is an issue as they are also less likely to receive support than the general population. Refugees in Rwanda are under the responsibility of UNHCR and WFP, who should ensure adequate food assistance is provided to refugees and therefore ameliorate the risks to health that result from food shortages, safeguarding these vulnerable communities.","Manirambona, Emery; Uwizeyimana, Theogene; Uwiringiyimana, Emmanuel; Reddy, Henna",Int J Equity Health,,875
