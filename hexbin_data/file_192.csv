468,Asymmetry in the Presence of Migration Stabilizes Multistrain Disease Outbreaks,2010-05-13,"We study the effect of migration between coupled populations, or patches, on the stability properties of multistrain disease dynamics. The epidemic model used in this work displays a Hopf bifurcation to oscillations in a single, well-mixed population. It is shown numerically that migration between two non-identical patches stabilizes the endemic steady state, delaying the onset of large amplitude outbreaks and reducing the total number of infections. This result is motivated by analyzing generic Hopf bifurcations with different frequencies and with diffusive coupling between them. Stabilization of the steady state is again seen, indicating that our observation in the full multistrain model is based on qualitative characteristics of the dynamics rather than on details of the disease model.","Bianco, Simone; Shaw, Leah B.",Bull Math Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2995850/,192

Therefore, understanding the microbiome in water‐damaged homes is critical to preventing these illnesses. Few studies have quantified bacterial contamination, especially specific species, in water‐damaged homes. We collected air and dust samples in twenty‐one low‐mold homes and twenty‐one high‐mold homes. The concentrations of three bacteria/genera, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Streptomyces sp., and Mycobacterium sp., were measured in air and dust samples using quantitative PCR (QPCR). The concentrations of the bacteria measured in the air samples were not associated with any specific home characteristic based on multiple regression models. However, higher concentrations of S. maltophilia in the dust samples were associated with water damage, that is, with higher floor surface moisture and higher concentrations of moisture‐related mold species. The concentrations of Streptomyces and Mycobacterium sp. had similar patterns and may be partially determined by human and animal occupants and outdoor sources of these bacteria.","Kettleson, E.; Kumar, S.; Reponen, T.; Vesper, S.; Méheust, D.; Grinshpun, S.

1386,"The General Composition of the Faecal Virome of Pigs Depends on Age, but Not on Feeding with a Probiotic Bacterium",2014-02-19,"BACKGROUND: The pig faecal virome, which comprises the community of viruses present in pig faeces, is complex and consists of pig viruses, bacteriophages, transiently passaged plant viruses and other minor virus species. Only little is known about factors influencing its general composition. Here, the effect of the probiotic bacterium Enterococcus faecium (E. faecium) NCIMB 10415 on the pig faecal virome composition was analysed in a pig feeding trial with sows and their piglets, which received either the probiotic bacterium or not. RESULTS: From 8 pooled faecal samples derived from the feeding trial, DNA and RNA virus particles were prepared and subjected to process-controlled Next Generation Sequencing resulting in 390,650 sequence reads. In average, 14% of the reads showed significant sequence identities to known viruses. The percentage of detected mammalian virus sequences was highest (55–77%) in the samples of the youngest piglets and lowest (8–10%) in the samples of the sows. In contrast, the percentage of bacteriophage sequences increased from 22–44% in the youngest piglets to approximately 90% in the sows. The dominating mammalian viruses differed remarkably among 12 day-old piglets (kobuvirus), 54 day-old piglets (boca-, dependo- and pig stool-associated small circular DNA virus [PigSCV]) and the sows (PigSCV, circovirus and “circovirus-like” viruses CB-A and RW-A). In addition, the Shannon index, which reflects the diversity of sequences present in a sample, was generally higher for the sows as compared to the piglets. No consistent differences in the virome composition could be identified between the viromes of the probiotic bacterium-treated group and the control group. CONCLUSION: The analysis indicates that the pig faecal virome shows a high variability and that its general composition is mainly dependent on the age of the pigs. Changes caused by feeding with the probiotic bacterium E. faecium could not be demonstrated using the applied metagenomics method.","Sachsenröder, Jana; Twardziok, Sven O.; Scheuch, Matthias; Johne, Reimar",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3929612/,192
2148,Six Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible Models on Scale-free Networks,2016-03-03,"Spreading phenomena are ubiquitous in nature and society. For example, disease and information spread over underlying social and information networks. It is well known that there is no threshold for spreading models on scale-free networks; this suggests that spread can occur on such networks, regardless of how low the contact rate may be. In this paper, I consider six models with different contact and propagation mechanisms, which include models studied so far, but are apt to be confused. To compare these six models, I analyze them by degree-based mean-field theory. I find that the result depends on the details of contact and propagation mechanism.","Morita, Satoru",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4776131/,192
2167,A Highly Efficient and Simple Construction Strategy for Producing Recombinant Baculovirus Bombyx mori Nucleopolyhedrovirus,2016-03-23,"The silkworm baculovirus expression system is widely used to produce recombinant proteins. Several strategies for constructing recombinant viruses that contain foreign genes have been reported. Here, we developed a novel defective-rescue BmNPV Bacmid (reBmBac) expression system. A CopyControl origin of replication was introduced into the viral genome to facilitate its genetic manipulation in Escherichia coli and to ensure the preparation of large amounts of high quality reBmBac DNA as well as high quality recombinant baculoviruses. The ORF1629, cathepsin and chitinase genes were partially deleted or rendered defective to improve the efficiency of recombinant baculovirus generation and the expression of foreign genes. The system was validated by the successful expression of luciferase reporter gene and porcine interferon γ. This system can be used to produce batches of recombinant baculoviruses and target proteins rapidly and efficiently in silkworms.","Liu, Xingjian; Wei, Yonglong; Li, Yinü; Li, Haoyang; Yang, Xin; Yi, Yongzhu; Zhang, Zhifang",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4805210/,192
3298,Identification and characterisation of the CD40-ligand of Sigmodon hispidus,2018-07-27,"Cotton rats are an important animal model to study infectious diseases. They have demonstrated higher susceptibility to a wider variety of human pathogens than other rodents and are also the animal model of choice for pre-clinical evaluations of some vaccine candidates. However, the genome of cotton rats remains to be fully sequenced, with much fewer genes cloned and characterised compared to other rodent species. Here we report the cloning and characterization of CD40 ligand, whose human and murine counterparts are known to be expressed on a range of cell types including activated T cells and B cells, dendritic cells, granulocytes, macrophages and platelets and exerts a broad array of immune responses. The cDNA for cotton rat CD40L we isolated is comprised of 1104 nucleotides with an open reading frame (ORF) of 783bp coding for a 260 amino acid protein. The recombinant cotton rat CD40L protein was recognized by an antibody against mouse CD40L. Moreover, it demonstrated functional activities on immature bone marrow dendritic cells by upregulating surface maturation markers (CD40, CD54, CD80, and CD86), and increasing IL-6 gene and protein expression. The availability of CD40L gene identity could greatly facilitate mechanistic research on pathogen-induced-immunopathogenesis and vaccine-elicited immune responses.","Russell, Marsha S.; Muralidharan, Abenaya; Larocque, Louise; Cao, Jingxin; Deschambault, Yvon; Varga, Jessie; Thulasi Raman, Sathya N.; Li, Xuguang",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6063397/,192
3541,Addicted to sugar: roles of glycans in the order Mononegavirales,2018-06-06,"Glycosylation is a biologically important protein modification process by which a carbohydrate chain is enzymatically added to a protein at a specific amino acid residue. This process plays roles in many cellular functions, including intracellular trafficking, cell–cell signaling, protein folding and receptor binding. While glycosylation is a common host cell process, it is utilized by many pathogens as well. Protein glycosylation is widely employed by viruses for both host invasion and evasion of host immune responses. Thus better understanding of viral glycosylation functions has potential applications for improved antiviral therapeutic and vaccine development. Here, we summarize our current knowledge on the broad biological functions of glycans for the Mononegavirales, an order of enveloped negative-sense single-stranded RNA viruses of high medical importance that includes Ebola, rabies, measles and Nipah viruses. We discuss glycobiological findings by genera in alphabetical order within each of eight Mononegavirales families, namely, the bornaviruses, filoviruses, mymonaviruses, nyamiviruses, paramyxoviruses, pneumoviruses, rhabdoviruses and sunviruses.","Ortega, Victoria; Stone, Jacquelyn A; Contreras, Erik M; Iorio, Ronald M; Aguilar, Hector C",Glycobiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6291800/,192
3688,A Survey of Recent Adenoviral Respiratory Pathogens in Hong Kong Reveals Emergent and Recombinant Human Adenovirus Type 4 (HAdV-E4) Circulating in Civilian Populations,2019-01-31,"Human adenovirus type 4 (HAdV-E4), which is intriguingly limited to military populations, causes acute respiratory disease with demonstrated morbidity and mortality implications. This respiratory pathogen contains genome identity with chimpanzee adenoviruses, indicating zoonotic origins. A signature of these “old” HAdV-E4 is the absence of a critical replication motif, NF-I, which is found in all HAdV respiratory pathogens and most HAdVs. However, our recent survey of flu-like disease in children in Hong Kong reveals that the emergent HAdV-E4 pathogens circulating in civilian populations contain NF-I, indicating recombination and reflecting host-adaptation that enables the “new” HAdV-E4 to replicate more efficiently in human cells and foretells more potential HAdV-E4 outbreaks in immune-naïve civilian populations. Special attention should be paid by clinicians to this emergent and recombinant HAdV-E4 circulating in civilian populations.","Zhang, Jing; Kang, June; Dehghan, Shoaleh; Sridhar, Siddharth; Lau, Susanna K.

Also as of November 2019, 79 novel antibodies were undergoing evaluation in late-stage clinical studies. Of the 79 antibodies, 39 were undergoing evaluation in late-stage studies for non-cancer indications, with 2 of these (ublituximab, pamrevlumab) also in late-stage studies for cancer indications. Companies developing 7 (tanezumab, aducanumab, evinacumab, etrolizumab, sutimlimab, anifrolumab, and teplizumab) of the 39 drugs have indicated that they may submit a marketing application in either the US or EU in 2020. Of the 79 antibodies in late-stage studies, 40 were undergoing evaluation as treatments for cancer, and potentially 9 of these (belantamab mafodotin, oportuzumab monatox, margetuximab, dostarlimab, spartalizumab, 131I-omburtamab, loncastuximab tesirine, balstilimab, and zalifrelimab) may enter regulatory review in late 2019 or in 2020.

5357,"Informational Landscapes in Art, Science, and Evolution",2006-06-08,"Infection age is often an important factor in epidemic dynamics. In order to realistically analyze the spreading mechanism and dynamical behavior of epidemic diseases, in this paper, a generalized disease transmission model of SIS type with age-dependent infection and birth and death on a heterogeneous network is discussed. The model allows the infection and recovery rates to vary and depend on the age of infection, the time since an individual becomes infected. We address uniform persistence and find that the model has the sharp threshold property, that is, for the basic reproduction number less than one, the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable, while for the basic reproduction number is above one, a Lyapunov functional is used to show that the endemic equilibrium is globally stable. Finally, some numerical simulations are carried out to illustrate and complement the main results. The disease dynamics rely not only on the network structure, but also on an age-dependent factor (for some key functions concerned in the model).","Chen, Shanshan; Small, Michael; Tao, Yizhou; Fu, Xinchu",Bull Math Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7088888/,192
5388,The Modeling of Global Epidemics: Stochastic Dynamics and Predictability,2006-06-20,"Lower urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common among the general population and are most often caused by bacterial pathogens. Viruses are an uncommon cause of UTIs in an immunocompetent host; however, viruses are increasingly recognized as the cause of lower UTI, especially hemorrhagic cystitis, among immunocompromised patients. BK virus, adenovirus, and cytomegalovirus are predominant pathogens involved in hemorrhagic cystitis after stem cell and solid organ transplantation, and their early diagnosis and treatment may prevent significant morbidity of hemorrhagic cystitis. The diagnosis of viral lower UTI is based on molecular techniques, and real-time polymerase chain reaction is often the method of choice because it allows for quantification of viral load. Cidofovir is becoming a drug of choice in viral UTIs because it is active against the most common viral pathogens. This review discusses the epidemiology, pitfalls in diagnosis, and current treatment of viral UTIs.","Paduch, Darius A.",Curr Urol Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7089127/,192

A commercially available automated human SAA turbidimetric immunoassay (SAA-TIA) was evaluated for determination of SAA in cats. Intra-assay and inter-assay imprecisions were in the ranges 2.1–9.9% and 7.0–12.5%, respectively, and without significant inaccuracy. Eighty-eight cats were divided into groups according to (A) the presence or absence of an acute-phase response (APR) (n = 23 and 65, respectively) and (B) clinical diagnosis (clinically healthy cats, cats diagnosed with inflammatory/infectious diseases, endocrine/metabolic diseases, neoplastic diseases, and miscellaneous disorders (n=43, 13, 8, 4 and 20, respectively)). The observed SAA concentrations were, as expected, different for (A) cats with and without an APR and (B) cats with inflammatory/infectious diseases compared to other diagnostic groups, except neoplastic diseases. In conclusion, the SAA concentration in cats could be measured reliably using the commercially available TIA designed for measuring human SAA, which should facilitate implementation of the parameter for routine diagnostic purposes.","Hansen, A.

However, outcome after transplantation is complicated by episodes of rejection and infections. Bronchoalveolar lavage is a valuable tool in monitoring patients after transplantation, since it allows the detection of pathogens. A marker specifically indicating rejection from changes in BAL fluid has not been found yet. Especially changes in differential cell count, like lymphocytosis or an increase in polymorphnuclear granulocytes, are unspecific. The role of high eosinophil levels in BAL has not been elucidated yet. We analyzed 25 BAL samples and clinical data of 4 patients who underwent lung transplantation and presented with recurrent episodes of eosinophilic alveolitis in BAL. All patients demonstrated a deterioration of clinical condition, lung function, and blood gas analysis during times of eosinophilia in BAL, compared to previous examinations. In all cases, eosinophilia in BAL was accompanied by rejection. All patients were finally treated with high doses of steroids, resulting in improvement of all parameters. Eosinophilia was not associated with significant changes in the IL-5 concentration in BAL or the pattern of IL-5 expression in BAL cells. In conclusion, eosinophilic alveolitis may indicate acute rejection in patients after lung transplantation, if other causes of eosinophilia are excluded.","Bewig, B.; Stewart, Susan; Böttcher, Heidi; Bastian, Andreas; Tiroke, Andreas; Hirt, Stefan; Haverich, Axel",Transpl Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7096104/,192
6316,Global dynamics for discrete-time analog of viral infection model with nonlinear incidence and CTL immune response,2016-05-23,"BACKGROUND: Malignant tumors are risk factors for a pulmonary embolism (PE), and a PE caused by a tumor is not uncommon. Primary pleural squamous cell carcinoma (PPSCC) is a rare malignancy; thus, a related PE is extremely rare. CASE PRESENTATION: A previously healthy 49-year-old female patient was admitted to Northern Jiangsu People’s Hospital owing to chest tightness, cough, and breathing difficulty that persisted for 3 days. Following admission, a computed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiography revealed an embolism in the main pulmonary artery, upper and lower pulmonary artery branch. The patient was treated with alteplase, warfarin, and antibiotics. Over the following year, she experienced recurrent chest pain and tightness and breathing difficulty, with multiple CT pulmonary angiography revealing thrombosis in the right and left main pulmonary artery. No abnormalities were observed in surrogate markers of autoimmune diseases, tumor antigen testing, or ultrasonography; thus, the cause of recurrent PE was not identified. Subsequently, a positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) examination revealed diffuse heterogeneous thickening of the right pleura and substantially increased glucose metabolism. A CT-guided pleural biopsy was performed, and histopathological examination of the pleura eventually revealed a diagnosis of PPSCC. CONCLUSIONS: PPSCC is a rare tumor that lacks specific clinical manifestations and is difficult to detect with imaging techniques. The occurrence of PE as the primary manifesting symptom in a patient with PPSCC is extremely rare. Thus, malignant tumors should be considered in patients with no risk factors for PE and/or in those with recurrent PE. An immediate diagnosis and adequate intervention can be achieved with increased awareness of this diagnosis and subsequent related examinations.","Chen, Zhongzhong; Feng, Tingting; Wang, Meng; Xu, Xingxiang; Wang, Yuxiu; Li, Yiran; Min, Lingfeng",BMC Pulm Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7099822/,192

Both splenocytes and IELs from uninfected and rotavirus-infected chickens were cytotoxic for LSCC-RP9, and the levels of this NK cell activity were not altered by infection of the host with rotavirus. IELs but not splenocytes from uninfected and rotavirus-infected chickens were cytotoxic for rotavirus-infected but not for uninfected chick kidney cell targets. Because this cytotoxic activity was not induced nor altered by rotavirus infection of the host, and was not major histocompatibility complex-restricted, it was considered to be due to NK cell activity. The cytotoxicity of IELs against rotavirus-infected target cells was dose-dependent; however, there was some suppression of cytotoxic activity at high effector to target cell ratios. There were no differences in the cytotoxic activities of IELs collected from the duodenum versus the jejunum. The in vitro cytotoxic activity of IELs against rotavirus-infected target cells suggested that NK cell activity may be an important immune response to rotavirus infections in vivo. The absence of cytotoxic activity by splenocytes against rotavirus-infected target cells indicated that there may be different subpopulations of NK cells in the spleen and intestinal epithelium of chickens.","Myers, T.J.; Schat, K.A.",Vet Immunol Immunopathol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7119783/,192

9471,Recensiones bibliográficas,2013-04-03,"The dynamic interactions of cancer cells with their microenvironment consisting of stromal cells (cellular part) and extracellular matrix (ECM) components (non-cellular) is essential to stimulate the heterogeneity of cancer cell, clonal evolution and to increase the multidrug resistance ending in cancer cell progression and metastasis. The reciprocal cell-cell/ECM interaction and tumor cell hijacking of non-malignant cells force stromal cells to lose their function and acquire new phenotypes that promote development and invasion of tumor cells. Understanding the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms governing these interactions can be used as a novel strategy to indirectly disrupt cancer cell interplay and contribute to the development of efficient and safe therapeutic strategies to fight cancer. Furthermore, the tumor-derived circulating materials can also be used as cancer diagnostic tools to precisely predict and monitor the outcome of therapy. This review evaluates such potentials in various advanced cancer models, with a focus on 3D systems as well as lab-on-chip devices.","Baghban, Roghayyeh; Roshangar, Leila; Jahanban-Esfahlan, Rana; Seidi, Khaled; Ebrahimi-Kalan, Abbas; Jaymand, Mehdi; Kolahian, Saeed; Javaheri, Tahereh; Zare, Peyman",Cell Commun Signal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7140346/,192

9702,ICS 2017 Abstracts,2017-07-26,"Decisionmakers are often presented with explicit likelihood assessments (e.g., there is a 10% chance that an attack will occur over the next three months) and supporting narrative evidence in forecasting and risk communication domains. Decisionmakers are thought to rely on both numerical and narrative information to the extent that they perceive the information to be diagnostic, accurate, and trustworthy. In two studies, we explored how lay decisionmakers varying in numeracy evaluated and used likelihood assessments and narrative evidence in forecasts. Overall, the less numerate reported higher risk and likelihood perceptions. In simple probabilistic forecasts without narrative evidence, decisionmakers at all levels of numeracy were able to use the stated likelihood information, although risk perceptions of the less numerate were more affected by likelihood format. When a forecast includes narrative evidence, decisionmakers were better able to use stated likelihood in a percentage as compared to frequency or verbal formats. The more numerate used stated likelihood more in their evaluations whereas the less numerate focused more on the narrative evidence. These results have important implications for risk analysts and forecasters who need to report the results of their analyses to decisionmakers. Decisionmakers varying in numerical ability may evaluate forecasts in different ways depending on the types of information they find easiest to evaluate.","Dieckmann, Nathan F.; Slovic, Paul; Peters, Ellen M.",Risk Anal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7159394/,192

The wetlands of coastal zones represent transitional ecosystems that are affected by these conditions, although little is known about the hydrogeochemistry of wetlands, especially coastal wetlands. In the present study, the hydrogeochemical characterization of coastal freshwater herbaceous wetlands in the Ciénaga del Fuerte Protected Natural Area in Veracruz, Mexico, in the American tropics was carried out per plant community. Four herbaceous wetlands (alligator flag, saw grass, cattail, and floodplain pasture) were monitored to understand the origin of the water feeding these ecosystems, the hydrogeochemical composition of groundwater, and the relationship between the groundwater and ecology of these ecosystems during dry and rainy seasons. The results indicate that Ciénaga del Fuerte is located in a regional discharge area and receives local recharge, so it is fed by both regional and local flows. The chemical composition varied temporally and spatially, creating unique conditions that determined the habitat occupied by the hydrophytic vegetation. The spatiotemporal behaviour of groundwater is one factor that, along with the hydroperiod, determines wetland dynamics and affects wetland biota (ecohydrogeochemistry). Generalist plant communities established in zones of local recharge, whereas other more specialized and/or plastic communities inhabited zones receiving regional flows with greater ion concentrations.

It is produced during the acute phase response (APR), a nonspecific systemic reaction to any type of tissue injury. In the blood of healthy horses, SAA concentration is very low, but it increases dramatically with inflammation. Due to the short half‐life of SAA, changes in its concentration in blood closely reflect the onset of inflammation and, therefore, measurement of SAA useful in the diagnosis and monitoring of disease and response to treatment. Increases in SAA concentration have been described in equine digestive, reproductive and respiratory diseases and following surgical procedures. Moreover, SAA has proven useful for detection of some subclinical pathologies that can disturb training and competing in equine athletes. Increasing availability of diagnostic tests for both laboratory and field use adds to SAA's applicability as a reliable indicator of horses’ health status. This review article presents the current information on changes in SAA concentrations in the blood of healthy and diseased horses, focussing on clinical application of this biomarker.","Witkowska‐Piłaszewicz, O.

We have characterized an animal tumor model that has 3 properties essential for the study of metastasis of colon carcinoma cells: epithelial cell origin; a reproducible pattern of metastatic behavior and the ability to be propagated both in vitro and in vivo to facilitate identification of biochemical correlates of metastasis. The KI2/TR cell line was derived from a transplantable colon carcinoma induced by dimethylhydrazine in the BD‐IX rat strain. Transmission electron microscopy of KI2/TR cells demonstrated junctional complexes, desmosomes and surface microvilli characteristic of gastrointestinal epithelial cells. The epithelial cell origin of KI2/TR was confirmed by demonstrating the presence of keratin, a marker of epithelial cells, but not vimentin, a constituent of mesenchymal cells. Secretion of CEA and Ca19‐9 antigens by KI2/TR cells in vitro was below the sensitivity of the assays (1 ng/ml and 6 U/ml respectively). KI2/TR cells produced tumors following s.c. injection into syngeneic BD‐IX rats, allogeneic RNU/rnuDF rats and xenogeneic CRL:nu/nuBR mice. Macroscopic lung metastases were observed in animals from all 3 groups. Distal lymph node metastases were more frequent in BD‐IX rats than in nude rats or mice. The histological appearances of all tumors and metastases were similar, showing a moderate to poorly differentiated glandular carcinoma. Intrasplenic injections of KI2/TR cells in nude mice resulted in liver colonization. Preferential growth of tumor cells at sites of trauma was also observed. The results show that the KI2/TR system can be used as a model to study metastasis of colon carcinoma cells and may find utility in the testing of chemotherapeutic agents against metastatic lesions.","Dunnington, Damien J.; Buscarino, Charles; Gennaro, Doris; Greig, Russell; Poste, George",Int J Cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7165865/,192

As seasonal influenza occurs on an annual basis, the circulating virus strains are closely monitored and a yearly updated vaccination is provided, especially to identified risk populations. Nonetheless, influenza virus infection may result in pneumonia and acute respiratory failure, frequently complicated by bacterial coinfection. Pandemics are, in contrary, unexpected rare events related to the emergence of a reassorted human-pathogenic influenza A virus (IAV) strains that often causes increased morbidity and spreads extremely rapidly in the immunologically naive human population, with huge clinical and economic impact. Accordingly, particular efforts are made to advance our knowledge on the disease biology and pathology and recent studies have brought new insights into IAV adaptation mechanisms to the human host, as well as into the key players in disease pathogenesis on the host side. Current antiviral strategies are only efficient at the early stages of the disease and are challenged by the genomic instability of the virus, highlighting the need for novel antiviral therapies targeting the pulmonary host response to improve viral clearance, reduce the risk of bacterial coinfection, and prevent or attenuate acute lung injury. This review article summarizes our current knowledge on the molecular basis of influenza infection and disease progression, the key players in pathogenesis driving severe disease and progression to lung failure, as well as available and envisioned prevention and treatment strategies against influenza virus infection.","Peteranderl, Christin; Herold, Susanne; Schmoldt, Carole",Semin Respir Crit Care Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7174870/,192

Health care experts predict a shortage of N95 FFRs if a severe pandemic occurs, and an option that has been suggested for mitigating such an FFR shortage is to decontaminate and reuse the devices. Before the effectiveness of this strategy can be established, many parameters affecting respiratory protection must be measured: biocidal efficacy of the decontamination treatment, filtration performance, pressure drop, fit, and toxicity to the end user post treatment. This research effort measured the amount of residual chemicals created or deposited on six models of FFRs following treatment by each of 7 simple decontamination technologies. Measured amounts of decontaminants retained by the FFRs treated with chemical disinfectants were small enough that exposure to wearers will be below the permissible exposure limit (PEL). Toxic by-products were also evaluated, and two suspected toxins were detected after ethylene oxide treatment of FFR rubber straps. The results provide encouragement to efforts promoting the evolution of effective strategies for decontamination and reuse of FFRs.","Salter, W.B.; Kinney, K.; Wallace, W.H.; Lumley, A.E.; Heimbuch, B.K.; Wander, J.D.",J Occup Environ Hyg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7196687/,192

Vegetated sites below bird‐nesting cliffs are uniquely nutrient‐rich habitats in the otherwise nutrient‐poor arctic environment. Plants from six distinct vegetation zones below such a cliff at 79° N, Svalbard, Norway, were collected for analysis under greenhouse conditions. Leaf nitrate reductase activity (NRA) was analysed in 42 species representing 25 % of the Svalbard vascular flora. The species mean NRA values ranged from 0.37 to 8.34 μmols of nitrite ions formed per gram of plant fresh weight per hour. Species in the vegetated zone growing closest to recent guano deposits had the highest NRA values, (mean = 4.47) whereas plants growing farther below the cliff had significantly lower values (mean = 0.55). A similar pattern was detected in a duplicate set of plants induced with 15 mM KNO(3); vegetation zone means for NRA ranged from 5.08 to 0.98 μmols of nitrite ions formed per gram of plant fresh weight per hour. Maximally induced species NRA values were highest in the first zones below the cliff and decreased downslope. This gradient paralleled the steep soil nitrate gradient, which decreased from 13.84 mg/l at the cliffbase to 1.03 mg/l downslope. Correspondingly, soil ammonium ions in the vegetation zones ranged between 1.96 mg/l at the cliff‐base to 0.03 mg/l downslope. Correlations between NRA and soil nitrate provide a systematic basis for assigning scalar ‘nitrogen figures’ as indicators of habitat preference, here for the first time applied to arctic species.","Odasz, Ann Marie",J Veg Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7201890/,192
10795,"Nitrate reductase activity in vegetation below an arctic bird cliff, Svalbard, Norway",2009-02-24,"1. The European Water Framework Directive provides a framework for improving the ecological quality of stream ecosystems, with deviation from reference used as a measure of ecological status. 2. Here we examine the possibility of using less impacted stream sites from Latvia, Lithuania and Poland to establish a Danish reference network for macrophyte assemblages, and as a guiding image for identification of possible references sites within Denmark. Both approaches were evaluated using historical Danish records. 3. Four different macrophyte assemblages were identified for mid‐sized streams in the Central and Eastern Lowland ecoregions. Macrophyte assemblages could not be delineated using physical stream site characteristics; however a gradual change in assemblage composition was attributed to differences in alkalinity and human impact. 4. Assemblages of contemporary vegetation in Denmark were quite similar to those found in Polish, Latvian and Lithuanian streams (26–35%). However, more importantly, from species‐based predictions we noted higher similarity, particularly with Latvian and Lithuanian streams, before intensive land use commenced in Denmark (c. 1900). These results show that stream sites from these three countries can be considered in a Danish reference network. 5. Two of the four macrophyte assemblages comprised species such as Fontinalis antipyretica, Myriophyllum spicatum, Nuphar lutea, Potamogeton alpinus and P. perfoliatus that have a very scattered occurrence in the contemporary vegetation in Denmark. These groups were closely associated with the predictions from historic records, thereby lending support the conjecture that these assemblages could be part of the guiding image for the identification of potential reference sites within Denmark.","BAATTRUP‐PEDERSEN, ANNETTE; SPRINGE, GUNTA; RIIS, TENNA; LARSEN, SØREN E.; SAND‐JENSEN, KAJ; KJELLERUP LARSEN, LARS M.",Freshw Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7201899/,192

Given the apparent high mortality associated with the novel swine-origin influenza A/H1N1 virus (S-OIV) in Mexico, we aimed to study the cytokine profiles induced by S-OIV and the effect of immunomodulators. Methods. We assayed cytokines and their messenger RNA (mRNA) levels in culture supernatants of human macrophages infected with H5N1, S-OIV California/04/2009 (S-OIV-CA), S-OIV Hong Kong/415742 (S-OIV-HK), or seasonal H1N1 with or without celecoxib and mesalazine. Results. Among the 12 cytokines showing detectable levels, levels of 8 proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin [IL] 2R, IL-6, interferon [IFN] α, macrophage inflammatory protein [MIP] α, MIP-1b, IFN-induced protein 10, regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted [RANTES], and monocyte chemotactic protein [MCP] 1) were higher in cells infected by H5N1 but similar among cells infected with H1N1, S-OIV-CA, or SOIV- HK. The levels of the other 4 cytokines were similar for H5N1, H1N1, S-OIV-CA and S-OIV-HK. Among the 8 cytokines induced by H5N1, 6 were suppressed by celecoxib and mesalazine. The mRNA levels of tumor necrosis factor a, IFN-γ, IL-6, and MCP-1 induced by H5N1 were higher than the levels of other cytokines at 12 and/or 24 h. Conclusions. No major cytokine storm, as seen in H5N1 infection, is associated with S-OIV infection of cell lines. The mainstay of treatment for uncomplicated S-OIV infections should be antiviral agents without immunomodulators. For individual S-OIV-infected patients with severe primary viral pneumonia, severe sepsis, and multiorgan failure, immunomodulators may be considered as an adjunctive therapy in clinical trials.","Woo, Patrick C.

10901,Takeover times for a simple model of network infection,2017-07-13,"Many progresses in the understanding of epidemic spreading models have been obtained thanks to numerous modeling efforts and analytical and numerical studies, considering host populations with very different structures and properties, including complex and temporal interaction networks. Moreover, a number of recent studies have started to go beyond the assumption of an absence of coupling between the spread of a disease and the structure of the contacts on which it unfolds. Models including awareness of the spread have been proposed, to mimic possible precautionary measures taken by individuals that decrease their risk of infection, but have mostly considered static networks. Here, we adapt such a framework to the more realistic case of temporal networks of interactions between individuals. We study the resulting model by analytical and numerical means on both simple models of temporal networks and empirical time-resolved contact data. Analytical results show that the epidemic threshold is not affected by the awareness but that the prevalence can be significantly decreased. Numerical studies on synthetic temporal networks highlight, however, the presence of very strong finite-size effects, resulting in a significant shift of the effective epidemic threshold in the presence of risk awareness. For empirical contact networks, the awareness mechanism leads as well to a shift in the effective threshold and to a strong reduction of the epidemic prevalence.","Moinet, Antoine; Pastor-Satorras, Romualdo; Barrat, Alain",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7217520/,192

Few studies have examined the impact of frailty on outcomes for patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the association of frailty with postoperative morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis. METHODS: Patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystectomy were identified from 2005 to 2010 in the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Project (NSQIP). The Modified Frailty Index (mFI) was used a surrogate for frailty, and patients were stratified as non-frail (mFI 0), low frailty (mFI 1–2), intermediate frailty (mFI 3–4) and high frailty (mFI ≥ 5). Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed. Receiver operator curves (ROC) and an area under the curve (AUC) were generated to determine accuracy of mFI in predicting postoperative morbidity and mortality. RESULTS: Of the 6898 patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy, 3245 (47%) patients were non-frail. There were 2913 (42%) patients with low-frailty, 649 (9%) patients with intermediate frailty, and 91 (2%) with high frailty. Clavien IV complications were higher for intermediate frail patients (OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.00–3.28, p = 0.050) and high-frail patients (OR 4.59, 95% CI 1.98–10.7, p < 0.001). Additionally, mortality was higher for patients with intermediate frailty (OR 4.69, 95% CI 1.37–16.0, p = 0.014) and high frailty (OR 12.2, 95% CI 2.67–55.5, p = 0.001). The mFI had excellent accuracy for mortality (AUC = 0.83) and Clavien IV complications (AUC = 0.73).

Increased activation of the central nervous system, driving enhanced sympathetic outflow and increased blood pressure, has emerged as a major contributor to the pathogenesis of hypertension. The hypothalamus is a key brain site acting to integrate central and peripheral inputs to ultimately impact blood pressure in multiple disease states that evoke hypertension. This review highlights recent advances that have identified novel signal transduction mechanisms within multiple hypothalamic nuclei (e.g., paraventricular nucleus, arcuate nucleus) acting to drive the pathophysiology of hypertension in neurogenic hypertension, angiotensin II hypertension, salt-sensitive hypertension, chronic intermittent hypoxia, and obesity-induced hypertension.

In the present study, we observed extrachromosomal double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) segments in various clinical isolates of Malassezia species. Malassezia is the most dominant fungal genus on the human skin surface, and species in this group are considered etiological factors of various skin diseases including dandruff, seborrheic dermatitis, and atopic dermatitis. We identified novel dsRNA segments, and our sequencing results revealed that the virus, named MrV40, belongs to the Totiviridae family and contains an additional satellite dsRNA segment encoding a novel protein. The transcriptome of virus-infected Malassezia restricta cells was compared to that of virus-cured cells, and the results showed that transcripts involved in ribosomal biosynthesis were downregulated and those involved in energy production and programmed cell death were upregulated. Moreover, transmission electron microscopy revealed significantly larger vacuoles in virus-infected M. restricta cells, indicating that MrV40 infection dramatically altered M. restricta physiology. Our analysis also revealed that viral nucleic acid from MrV40 induced a TLR3 (Toll-like receptor 3)-mediated inflammatory immune response in bone marrow-derived dendritic cells, suggesting that a viral element contributes to the pathogenicity of Malassezia.","Park, Minji; Cho, Yong-Joon; Kim, Donggyu; Yang, Chul-Su; Lee, Shi Mun; Dawson, Thomas L.; Nakamizo, Satoshi; Kabashima, Kenji; Lee, Yang Won; Jung, Won Hee",mBio,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7468201/,192

The results suggest that genetic counseling may have a positive impact on risk perception accuracy, though some studies observed no impact at all, or only for low-risk participants. Several implications for future research can be deduced. First, future researchers should link risk perception changes to objective risk estimates, define risk perception accuracy as the correct counseled risk estimate, and report both the proportion of individuals who correctly estimate their risk and the average overestimation of the risk. Second, as the descriptions of the counseling sessions were generally poor, future research should include more detailed description of these sessions and link their content to risk perception outcomes to allow interpretation of the results. Finally, the effect of genetic counseling should be examined for a wider variety of hereditary conditions. Genetic counselors should provide the necessary context in which counselees can understand risk information, use both verbal and numerical risk estimates to communicate personal risk information, and use visual aids when communicating numerical risk information.","Smerecnik, Chris M.

Compared to those with better LV function, infants with moderate to severe LV dysfunction were older at presentation (12 vs. 6 days, p = 0.004), had more postoperative cardiac intensive care unit (ICU) days (5 vs. 3, p < 0.001), and more ventilator days (3.5 vs. 1, p < 0.001). The median time to normal LV EF (≥ 55%) was 6 days postoperatively (range 1–230 days). Infants presenting with moderate to severe LV dysfunction had higher index hospitalization costs ($90,560 vs. $59,968, p = 0.02), but no difference in cost of medical follow-up for the first year following discharge ($3,078 vs. $2,568, p = 0.46). In the current era, > 10% of infants with coarctation present with moderate to severe LV dysfunction that typically recovers. Those with moderate to severe dysfunction had longer duration of mechanical ventilation and postoperative cardiac ICU stays, likely driving higher costs of index hospitalization.","McFarland, Carol A.; Truong, Dongngan T.; Pinto, Nelangi M.; Minich, L.

13373,Prediction of rifampicin resistance beyond the RRDR using structure-based machine learning approaches,2020-10-22,"PURPOSE: Existing clinical practice guidelines support the use of neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBA) in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); however, a recent large randomized clinical trial (RCT) has questioned this practice. Therefore, we updated a previous systematic review to determine the efficacy and safety of NMBAs in ARDS. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE (October 2012 to July 2019), the Cochrane (Central) database, and clinical trial registries (ClinicalTrials.gov, ISRCTN Register, and WHO ICTRP) for RCTs comparing the effects of NMBA as a continuous infusion versus placebo or no NMBA infusion (but allowing intermittent NMBA boluses) on patient-important outcomes for adults with ARDS. Two independent reviewers assessed the methodologic quality of the primary studies and abstracted data. RESULTS: Seven RCTs, including four new RCTs, met eligibility criteria for this review. These trials enrolled 1598 patients with moderate to severe ARDS at centers in the USA, France, and China. All trials assessed short-term continuous infusions of cisatracurium or vecuronium. The pooled estimate for mortality outcomes showed significant statistical heterogeneity, which was only explained by a subgroup analysis by depth of sedation in the control arm. A continuous NMBA infusion did not improve mortality when compared to a light sedation strategy with no NMBA infusion (relative risk [RR] 0.99; 95% CI 0.86–1.15; moderate certainty; P = 0.93). On the other hand, continuous NMBA infusion reduced mortality when compared to deep sedation with as needed NMBA boluses (RR 0.71; 95% CI 0.57–0.89; low certainty; P = 0.003). Continuous NMBA infusion reduced the rate of barotrauma (RR 0.55; 95% CI 0.35–0.85, moderate certainty; P = 0.008) across eligible trials, but the effect on ventilator-free days, duration of mechanical ventilation, and ICU-acquired weakness was uncertain. CONCLUSIONS: Inconsistency in study methods and findings precluded the pooling of all trials for mortality. In a pre-planned sensitivity analysis, the impact of NMBA infusion on mortality depends on the strategy used in the control arm, showing reduced mortality when compared to deep sedation, but no effect on mortality when compared to lighter sedation. In both situations, a continuous NMBA infusion may reduce the risk of barotrauma, but the effects on other patient-important outcomes remain unclear. Future research, including an individual patient data meta-analysis, could help clarify some of the observed findings in this updated systematic review.","Tarazan, Nehal; Alshehri, Moayad; Sharif, Sameer; Al Duhailib, Zainab; Møller, Morten Hylander; Belley-Cote, Emilie; Alshahrani, Mohammed; Centofanti, John; McIntyre, Lauralyn; Baw, Bandar; Meade, Maureen; Alhazzani, Waleed",Intensive Care Med Exp,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7582438/,192
13784,"Erratum: Strains, functions and dynamics in the expanded Human Microbiome Project",2017-10-12,"Dynamic consent has been proposed as a strategy for addressing the limitations of traditional, broad consent for biobank participation. Although the argument for dynamic consent has been made on theoretical grounds, empirical studies evaluating the potential utility of dynamic consent are needed to enhance deliberations about the merits of dynamic consent. Few studies have assessed such considerations as whether donor preferences may change over time or if participants would use a dynamic consent mechanism to modify preferences when they change. We administered a 66-item survey to participants in a large DNA biobank. The survey sought to gauge the stability of donor preferences specified at the time of biobank enrollment, specifically the stability of donors’ preference regarding posthumous availability of biospecimens to next-of-kin. We received 1164 completed surveys for a response rate of 72%. Forty percent of respondents indicated a preference regarding sample availability on the survey (T2) that was inconsistent with the preference they had expressed when they enrolled in the biobank (T1). Most (94%) individuals with inconsistent preferences regarding sample availability had initially restricted sample availability at T1 but were comfortable with broader availability when asked at the time of the survey (T2). Our findings demonstrate that preferences regarding sample use expressed at the time of enrollment in a DNA biobank may not be reliable indicators of donor preferences over time. These findings lend empirical support to the case for a dynamic consent model in which biobank participants are approached over time to clarify their views regarding sample use.","Pacyna, Joel E.; McCormick, Jennifer B.; Olson, Janet E.; Winkler, Erin M.; Bublitz, Josh T.; Hathcock, Matthew A.; Sharp, Richard R.",Eur J Hum Genet,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7608348/,192
13887,Publisher Correction: Federated discovery and sharing of genomic data using Beacons,2019-03-20,"PURPOSE: Single center, noninterventional cohort study to assess 10-year visual and anatomical outcomes following initiation of treatment with antivascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agents in neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) patients. Neovascular AMD patients initiated on intravitreal anti-VEGF injections in 2008–2009 and continued to be followed up for at least 10 years were included in this study. METHODS: The Moorfields OpenEyes database was searched for all patients who were initiated on anti-VEGF therapy for neovascular AMD in 2008–2009 and the visual acuity (VA) in Early Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) letters and injection records were analyzed for those who have had at least 10-year follow-up. The spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) scans, color fundus photos, and fundus fluorescein angiography (FA) were graded by two retinal physicians. The outcomes were also compared between those with good and poor VA outcomes based on pre-defined criteria. The primary end point was change in VA at 10 years; secondary outcomes included percentage with VA of 20/40 or better, 20/70 or better, VA gains and losses, anatomic outcomes and number of injections. RESULTS: After a mean of 10.04 years after initiation of anti-VEGF therapy, the mean decline in VA from baseline was −2.1 ETDRS letters (SD 19.9, p = 0.65). One hundred eyes (67.1%) achieved a VA threshold of 20/70 or better, 33.5% achieved a VA of 20/40 or better, and 76.5% eyes maintained VA defined as a loss of less than 15 letters. Fourteen percent of study eyes had VA of 20/200 or worse and 23.5% declined by 15 letters or more. 87.5% of eyes were switched from ranibizumab to aflibercept during the course of 10 years and the eyes received a mean of 52.2 (SD 18.1) injections over 10 years. From this cohort, 87 (58.3%) eyes are having on-going treatment. On OCT, 34.9% had persistent fluid at the last visit, 6.7% patients showed new onset atrophy compared to baseline, and 43.7% had increased area of macular atrophy. The mean area of atrophy at the final visit was 4.15 mm(2). Comparison between the good and worse visual outcome groups showed lower baseline VA, fovea-involving atrophy and final area of atrophy had a statistically significant negative effect on the final visual outcome (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Regular monitoring and anti-VEGF treatment over 10 years reduce the risk of visual loss of 15 letters or more in patients with neovascular AMD. The most common cause of substantial visual decline was macular atrophy.","Chandra, Shruti; Arpa, Cristina; Menon, Deepthy; Khalid, Hagar; Hamilton, Robin; Nicholson, Luke; Pal, Bishwanath; Fasolo, Sandro; Hykin, Philip; Keane, Pearse A.; Sivaprasad, Sobha",Eye (Lond),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7608465/,192

Carbon-based supercapacitors are increasingly attracting attention because of their large surface area and high porosity. Carbon-based materials research has been recently centered on biomass-based materials due to the rising need to maintain a sustainable environment. Cellulose and lignin constitute the major components of lignocellulose biomass. Since they are renewable, sustainable, and readily accessible, lignin and cellulose-based supercapacitors are economically viable and environmentally friendly. This review aims to systematically analyze published research findings on electrospun lignin, cellulose, and lignin/cellulose nanofibers for use as supercapacitor electrode materials. A rigorous scientific approach was employed to screen the eligibility of relevant articles to be included in this study. The research questions and the inclusion criteria were clearly defined. The included articles were used to draw up the research framework and develop coherent taxonomy of literature. Taxonomy of research literature generated from the included articles was classified into review papers, electrospun lignin, cellulose, and lignin/cellulose nanofibers for use as supercapacitor electrode materials. Furthermore, challenges, recommendations, and research directions for future studies were equally discussed extensively. Before this study, no review on electrospun lignin/cellulose nanofiber-based supercapacitors has been reported. Thus, this systematic review will provide a reference for other researchers interested in developing biomass-based supercapacitors as an alternative to conventional supercapacitors based on petroleum products.","Adam, Abdullahi Abbas; Ojur Dennis, John; Al-Hadeethi, Yas; Mkawi, E.

It usually causes mild upper- and lower-respiratory tract infections. HBoV infection seems to be rare during adulthood, probably due to high antibody titers resulting from childhood infection and seroconversion. The clinical significance, possible complications, and consequences of an adulthood infection are still unclear. Furthermore, the consequences of HBoV infection during pregnancy are seldom reported in the literature. CASE REPORT: We report the case of a 22-year-old pregnant woman in her third trimester who presented with a 1-week history of fever and cough followed by progressive shortness of breath. She was treated initially as a case of severe pneumonia; however, her condition deteriorated rapidly, resulting in hypoxic respiratory failure that required intensive care support. The patient was found to have dilated cardiomyopathy on echocardiography, and her fetal ultrasound showed no fetal heart activity; subsequently, labor induction for stillbirth was performed. An extensive workup for an underlying cause was unrevealing apart from positive respiratory viral PCR assay for human bocavirus, performed twice. A provisional diagnosis of HBoV pneumonia complicated by dilated cardiomyopathy, stillbirth, and multiorgan failure was made. Fortunately, the patient had a good recovery and was discharged home in good clinical condition. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to severe pneumonia, HBoV infection may result in other life-threatening complications. Although the infection is rare during adulthood, infection in a pregnant woman should be taken seriously and close monitoring of such patients is advised.","Bishawi, Ahmad Al; Ben Abid, Fatma; Ibrahim, Wanis",Am J Case Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7811980/,192

15977,Parcels and particles: Markov blankets in the brain,2021-03-01,"BACKGROUND: As the only non-European Union (EU) country, Serbia participated in a second point prevalence survey of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) and antimicrobial use (AMU) organized by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) in the EU countries. Here, we aimed to estimate the prevalence of HAI and AMU in patients who had recently undergone a surgery and to compare risk profile, HAI rates, and AMU among surgical patients and non-surgical patients. METHODS: A national PPS was performed in 65 Serbian acute-care hospitals, in November 2017. In this paper, the data of 61 hospitals for adult acute-care were analyzed. To ensure the comparability of study design we used the Serbian translation of ECDC case definitions and ECDC PPS protocol. The trained infection control staff, led by a hospital coordinator, reviewed medical records to identify HAI active at the time of the survey and AMU. Only inpatients admitted to the ward before 8 a.m. on the day if the survey were included. RESULTS: A total of 12,478 patients from 61 hospitals for adult acute-care were eligible for inclusion in this study. Significantly higher proportions of surgical patients were female, belonged to the 60-to-79 age group, and were less severely ill. Also, extrinsic factors (invasive devices, hospitalization at the ICU, and prior antibiotics therapy) were more frequent in surgical patients. Prevalence of HAIs was higher among surgical patients (261/3626; 7.2%) than among non-surgical patients (258/8852; 2.9%) (p < 0.0001). The highest prevalence of all HAIs was noted in patients who had kidney transplantation (4/11; 36.4%), while SSIs were the most prevalent among patients who had peripheral vascular bypass surgery (3/15; 20.0%). Non-surgical patients received treatment for community-acquired infections in significantly higher proportion (2664/8852; 64.3) (p < 0.001). Surgical prophylaxis for more than 1 day was applied in 71.4% of surgical patients. CONCLUSION: We have provided an insight into the burden of HAIs and AMU among Serbia acute-care hospitals, and highlighted several priority areas and targets for quality improvement.","Šuljagić, Vesna; Bajčetić, Milica; Mioljević, Vesna; Dragovac, Gorana; Mijović, Biljana; Janićijević, Ivana; Đorđević, Zorana; Krtinić, Gordana; Rakić, Violeta; Ćirković, Ivana; Nikolić, Vladimir; Marković-Denić, Ljiljana",Antimicrob Resist Infect Control,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7936242/,192

However, little is known about the current status of trials on artificial intelligence (AI) conducted in emergency department and intensive care unit. The objective of the study was to provide a comprehensive analysis of registered trials in such field based on ClinicalTrials.gov. Methods: Registered trials on AI conducted in emergency department and intensive care unit were searched on ClinicalTrials.gov up to 12th January 2021. The characteristics were analyzed using SPSS21.0 software. Results: A total of 146 registered trials were identified, including 61 in emergency department and 85 in intensive care unit.

17343,Growing the pattern: Our first year,2021-04-09,"Breast cancer (BC) is one of the most common types of cancer that affects females worldwide. It may lead to irreversible complications and even death due to late diagnosis and treatment. The pathological analysis is considered the gold standard for BC detection, but it is a challenging task. Automatic diagnosis of BC could reduce death rates, by creating a computer aided diagnosis (CADx) system capable of accurately identifying BC at an early stage and decreasing the time consumed by pathologists during examinations. This paper proposes a novel CADx system named Histo-CADx for the automatic diagnosis of BC. Most related studies were based on individual deep learning methods. Also, studies did not examine the influence of fusing features from multiple CNNs and handcrafted features. In addition, related studies did not investigate the best combination of fused features that influence the performance of the CADx. Therefore, Histo-CADx is based on two stages of fusion. The first fusion stage involves the investigation of the impact of fusing several deep learning (DL) techniques with handcrafted feature extraction methods using the auto-encoder DL method. This stage also examines and searches for a suitable set of fused features that could improve the performance of Histo-CADx. The second fusion stage constructs a multiple classifier system (MCS) for fusing outputs from three classifiers, to further improve the accuracy of the proposed Histo-CADx. The performance of Histo-CADx is evaluated using two public datasets; specifically, the BreakHis and the ICIAR 2018 datasets. The results from the analysis of both datasets verified that the two fusion stages of Histo-CADx successfully improved the accuracy of the CADx compared to CADx constructed with individual features. Furthermore, using the auto-encoder for the fusion process has reduced the computation cost of the system. Moreover, the results after the two fusion stages confirmed that Histo-CADx is reliable and has the capacity of classifying BC more accurately compared to other latest studies. Consequently, it can be used by pathologists to help them in the accurate diagnosis of BC. In addition, it can decrease the time and effort needed by medical experts during the examination.","Attallah, Omneya; Anwar, Fatma; Ghanem, Nagia M.; Ismail, Mohamed A.",PeerJ Comput Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8093954/,192

18086,New models for donor-recipient matching in lung transplantations,2021-06-04,"BACKGROUND: Sugammadex is a synthetic γ-cyclodextrin derivative designed to selectively bind to steroidal neuromuscular blocking agents and reverse their effects. Although many cases of sugammadex-induced anaphylaxis have been reported, few studies have investigated the underlying mechanism. CASE PRESENTATION: A 55-year-old Japanese man underwent a laryngectomy under general anesthesia. One month before laryngectomy, he had undergone laryngoscopy under general anesthesia and received sugammadex administration without causing hypersensitivity. He had no history of allergies. The operation was finished without complications. Shortly after sugammadex administration, his blood pressure dropped to approximately 70 mmHg, and his heart rate increased to 110 beats/minute with systemic erythema. Suspecting anaphylaxis, he was treated with the intravenous injection of phenylephrine, d-chlorpheniramine, and hydrocortisone. After these treatments, his cardiovascular condition stabilized. Eight months after the event, skin prick tests and intradermal tests with all agents used during general anesthesia were performed. Intradermal tests showed positive results only for sugammadex. Subsequently, basophil activation tests with CD203c were performed using sugammadex, γ-cyclodextrin, and positive controls (anti-immunoglobulin-E and formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine). In addition to both controls, sugammadex, but not γ-cyclodextrin, induced significant upregulation of CD203c expression. We performed additional basophil activation tests with wortmannin, an inhibitor of phosphoinositide 3-kinase, to investigate the mechanism underlying sugammadex-induced basophil activation. The inhibitory effect of wortmannin on basophil activation due to sugammadex was similar to that of anti-immunoglobulin-E, suggesting an immunoglobulin-E-dependent mechanism. Although the patient showed no hypersensitivity after the first exposure of sugammadex, anaphylaxis appeared after the second administration. Because most cases of sugammadex-induced anaphylaxis reportedly appeared after first administration, this seems to be a rare case. CONCLUSIONS: In the present case, sugammadex-induced anaphylaxis might have occurred through an immunoglobulin-E-dependent mechanism and not involve γ-cyclodextrin as an epitope. Physicians should pay attention to the occurrence of sugammadex-induced anaphylaxis even when the patient has a history of safe administration of sugammadex.","Horiuchi, Tatsuo; Takazawa, Tomonori; Sakamoto, Shinya; Orihara, Masaki; Yokohama, Akihiko; Uchiyama, Mutsumi; Saito, Shigeru",J Med Case Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8178030/,192
18338,Niche theory‐based modeling of assembly processes of viral communities in bats,2021-04-03,"BACKGROUND: The death rate (the number of deaths per 100 000 people per year) of colorectal cancer (CRC) has been dropping since 1980 due to increased screening, lifestyle-related risk factors, and improved treatment options; however, CRC is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths in men and women in the United States. Therefore, successful therapy for CRC is an unmet clinical need. This study aimed to investigate the impacts of andrographolide (AGP) and melatonin (MLT) on CRC and the underlying mechanism. METHODS: To investigate AGP and MLT anticancer effects, a series of metastatic colon cancer cell lines (T84, Colo 205, HT-29, and DLD-1) were selected. In addition, a metastatic patient-derived organoid model (PDOD) was used to monitor the anticancer effects of AGP and MLT. A series of bioassays including 3D organoid cell culture, MTT, colony formation, western blotting, immunofluorescence, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) were performed. RESULTS: The dual therapy significantly promotes CRC cell death, as compared with the normal cells. It also limits CRC colony formation and disrupts the PDOD membrane integrity along with decreased Ki-67 expression. A significantly higher cleaved caspase-3 and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress proteins, IRE-1 and ATF-6 expression, by 48 hours were found. This combinatorial treatment increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Apoptosis signaling molecules BAX, XBP-1, and CHOP were significantly increased as determined by qPCR. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicated that AGP and MLT associated ER stress-mediated apoptotic metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) cell death through the IRE-1/XBP-1/CHOP signaling pathway. This novel combination could be a potential therapeutic strategy for mCRC cells.","Sharda, Neha; Ikuse, Tamaki; Hill, Elizabeth; Garcia, Sonia; Czinn, Steven J; Bafford, Andrea; Blanchard, Thomas G; Banerjee, Aditi",Clin Med Insights Oncol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8182223/,192
18661,Unanswered,2021-06-29,"The complement system is an important defense mechanism against pathogens; however, in certain pathologies, the system also attacks human cells, such as red blood cells (RBCs). In paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), RBCs lack certain complement regulators which sensitize them to complement-mediated lysis, while in autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA), antibodies against RBCs may initiate complement-mediated hemolysis. In recent years, complement inhibition has improved treatment prospects for these patients, with eculizumab now the standard of care for PNH patients. Current complement inhibitors are however not sufficient for all patients, and they come with high costs, patient burden, and increased infection risk. This review gives an overview of the underlying pathophysiology of complement-mediated hemolysis in PNH and AIHA, the role of therapeutic complement inhibition nowadays, and the high number of complement inhibitors currently under investigation, as for almost every complement protein, an inhibitor is being developed. The focus lies with novel therapeutics that inhibit complement activity specifically in the pathway that causes pathology or those that reduce costs or patient burden through novel administration routes.","Jalink, M.; de Boer, E.

This article provides an overview of the program's evolution and its current form; presents successes and impacts; and discusses challenges, lessons learned, and potential further directions. Initiated in 2008, the Fellows Program underwent several rounds of improvement. The current model involves a competitive team application process, 2 intensive in-person workshops, completion of a working paper of publishable quality, and the transfer of analysis skills learned during the fellowship to students and colleagues at home universities, all completed over 1 year. Since 2011, the Fellows Program has trained 152 researchers from 45 universities in 25 countries in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. The program has not only strengthened individual skills in conducting research with data from large surveys but also substantially increased institutional capacity to analyze DHS data through fellows' capacity-building activities at their home universities. These successes have happened despite the many and continuing challenges related to fellows' diverse backgrounds, experience, skills, language barriers, logistical difficulties in organizing in-person workshops in fellows' countries, and sometimes fellows' varying levels of commitment. With continuous support from USAID, the program hopes to expand to more universities and countries, especially francophone countries. Overall, the DHS Faculty Fellows Program has proven to be highly successful and provides a model for other groups aiming to strengthen capacity for data use and research in low- and middle-income countries.","Wang, Wenjuan; Assaf, Shireen; Pullum, Thomas; Kishor, Sunita",Glob Health Sci Pract,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8324205/,192

After four rounds of bio-panning, 25 positives were isolated and identified successfully. The highest positive scFv-22 was expressed in E. coli BL21. Then, its recognition mechanisms were studied using the molecular docking method. The result showed the amino acid residue Val160 was the key residue for the binding of scFv to CIP. Based on the results of virtual mutation, the scFv antibody was evolved by directional mutagenesis of contact amino acid residue Val160 to Ser. After the expression and purification, an indirect competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (IC-ELISA) based on the parental and mutant scFv was established for CIP, respectively. The IC50 value of the assay established with the ScFv mutant was 1.58 ng/mL, while the parental scFv was 26.23 ng/mL; this result showed highly increased affinity, with up to 16.6-fold improved sensitivity. The mean recovery for CIP ranged from 73.80% to 123.35%, with 10.46% relative standard deviation between the intra-assay and the inter-assay. The RSD values ranged between 1.49% and 9.81%. The results indicate that we obtained a highly sensitive anti-CIP scFv by the phage library construction and directional evolution, and the scFv-based IC-ELISA is suitable for the detection of CIP residue in animal-derived edible tissues.","Wang, Fangyu; Li, Ning; Zhang, Yunshang; Sun, Xuefeng; Hu, Man; Zhao, Yali; Fan, Jianming",Foods,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8394695/,192
20424,Preparation and Directed Evolution of Anti-Ciprofloxacin ScFv for Immunoassay in Animal-Derived Food,2021-08-20,"Human pregnancy is a sequence of events finely tuned by several molecular interactions that come with a new birth. The precise interlocking of these events affecting the reproductive system guarantees safe embryo formation and fetal development. In this scenario, melatonin and myo-inositol seem to be pivotal not only in the physiology of the reproduction process, but also in the promotion of positive gestational outcomes. Evidence demonstrates that melatonin, beyond the role of circadian rhythm management, is a key controller of human reproductive functions. Similarly, as the most representative member of the inositol’s family, myo-inositol is essential in ensuring correct advancing of reproductive cellular events. The molecular crosstalk mediated by these two species is directly regulated by their availability in the human body. To date, biological implications of unbalanced amounts of melatonin and myo-inositol in each pregnancy step are growing the idea that these molecules actively contribute to reduce negative outcomes and improve the fertilization rate. Clinical data suggest that melatonin and myo-inositol may constitute an optimal dietary supplementation to sustain safe human gestation and a new potential way to prevent pregnancy-associated pathologies.","Russo, Michele; Forte, Gianpiero; Montanino Oliva, Mario; Laganà, Antonio Simone; Unfer, Vittorio",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8395120/,192
20524,Development of Environment-Friendly Membrane for Oily Industrial Wastewater Filtration,2021-08-11,"Six foals with interstitial pneumonia of undetermined etiology from Southern California were analyzed by viral metagenomics. Spleen, lung, and colon content samples obtained during necropsy from each animal were pooled, and nucleic acids from virus-like particles enriched for deep sequencing. The recently described equine copiparvovirus named eqcopivirus, as well as three previously uncharacterized viruses, were identified. The complete ORFs genomes of two closely related protoparvoviruses, and of a bocaparvovirus, plus the partial genome of a picornavirus were assembled. The parvoviruses were classified as members of new ungulate protoparvovirus and bocaparvovirus species in the Parvoviridae family. The picornavirus was classified as a new species in the Salivirus genus of the Picornaviridae family. Spleen, lung, and colon content samples from each foal were then tested for these viral genomes by nested PCR and RT-PCR. When present, parvoviruses were detected in both feces and spleen. The picornavirus, protoparvovirus, and eqcopivirus genomes were detected in the lungs of one animal each. Three foals were co-infected with the picornavirus and either a protoparvovirus, bocaparvovirus, or eqcopivirus. Two other foals were infected with a protoparvovirus only. No viral infection was detected in one animal. The complete ORFs of the first equine protoparvoviruses and bocaparvovirus, the partial ORF of the third equine picornavirus, and their detection in tissues of foals with interstitial pneumonia are described here. Testing the involvement of these viruses in fatal interstitial pneumonia or other equine diseases will require larger epidemiological and/or inoculation studies.","Altan, Eda; Hui, Alvin; Li, Yanpeng; Pesavento, Patricia; Asín, Javier; Crossley, Beate; Deng, Xutao; Uzal, Francisco A.; Delwart, Eric",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8402702/,192

The chemokine CXCL10 is present at high levels in fatal cases of cerebral malaria patients, but is reduced in patients who survive and do not have complications. Here we show a Pf ‘decision-sensing-system’ controlled by CXCL10 concentration. High CXCL10 expression prompts P. falciparum to initiate a survival strategy via growth acceleration. Remarkably, P. falciparum inhibits CXCL10 synthesis in monocytes by disrupting the association of host ribosomes with CXCL10 transcripts. The underlying inhibition cascade involves RNA cargo delivery into monocytes that triggers RIG-I, which leads to HUR1 binding to an AU-rich domain of the CXCL10 3’UTR. These data indicate that when the parasite can no longer keep CXCL10 at low levels, it can exploit the chemokine as a cue to shift tactics and escape.","Ofir-Birin, Yifat; Ben Ami Pilo, Hila; Cruz Camacho, Abel; Rudik, Ariel; Rivkin, Anna; Revach, Or-Yam; Nir, Netta; Block Tamin, Tal; Abou Karam, Paula; Kiper, Edo; Peleg, Yoav; Nevo, Reinat; Solomon, Aryeh; Havkin-Solomon, Tal; Rojas, Alicia; Rotkopf, Ron; Porat, Ziv; Avni, Dror; Schwartz, Eli; Zillinger, Thomas; Hartmann, Gunther; Di Pizio, Antonella; Quashie, Neils Ben; Dikstein, Rivka; Gerlic, Motti; Torrecilhas, Ana Claudia; Levy, Carmit; Nolte-‘t Hoen, Esther N.

20743,Arthrosetherapie,2021-09-01,"PDE5 (phosphodiesterase 5) inhibition reduces the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias following myocardial ischemia. However, the mechanisms of the antiarrhythmic effects of PDE5 inhibition are unknown. Diastolic calcium (Ca(2+)) waves lead to arrhythmias by inducing delayed afterdepolarizations (DADs). Ca(2+) waves are initiated when sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+) content reaches a threshold level and the SR releases Ca(2+) spontaneously and generates a depolarizing inward sodium-calcium exchange current. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of PDE5 inhibition on the propensity for ventricular arrhythmias in a proarrhythmic large animal model and establish the role of alterations of intracellular Ca(2+) cycling/SR Ca(2+) content. METHODS AND RESULTS: Arrhythmia burden, monophasic action potentials, and beat-to-beat variability of repolarization were measured in a sheep model using the I(Kr) inhibitor dofetilide to induce QT prolongation and arrhythmia. Ca(2+) transients, Ca(2+) waves, and SR Ca(2+) content were measured in isolated ventricular myocytes. PDE5 inhibition was achieved using acute application of sildenafil, and PKG (protein kinase G) was inhibited with KT5823. PDE5 inhibition reduced beat-to-beat variability of repolarization and suppressed afterdepolarizations, premature ventricular complexes, and torsade de pointes in vivo. In single cells, dofetilide-induced delayed afterdepolarizations and triggered action potentials were suppressed by PDE5 inhibition. PDE5 inhibition decreased Ca(2+) wave frequency in all cells and abolished waves in 12 of 22 cells. A decrease in SR Ca(2+) uptake, increased trans-sarcolemmal Ca(2+) efflux, and reduced trans-sarcolemmal Ca(2+) influx led to a reduction of SR Ca(2+) content and Ca(2+) wave abolition. These effects were dependent on PKG activation. CONCLUSIONS: PDE5 inhibition acutely suppresses triggered ventricular arrhythmias in vivo, and cellular data suggests this occurs via suppression of cellular Ca(2+) waves. These novel antiarrhythmic properties of PDE5 inhibition are mediated by a reduction of SR Ca(2+) content and are PKG dependent.","Hutchings, David C.; Pearman, Charles M.; Madders, George W.P.; Woods, Lori S.; Eisner, David A.; Dibb, Katharine M.; Trafford, Andrew W.",Circ Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8409902/,192

21146,ESNR 2021,2021-09-15,"PURPOSE: Previous clinical studies have suggested an effect of gender on outcome after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, but the results are conflicting and there is no uniform agreement regarding gender differences in survival and prognosis. The present study was aimed to investigate the interaction between gender and post resuscitation interventions on neurological outcome in an asphyxial rat model of cardiac arrest. METHODS: Asphyxia was induced by blocking the endotracheal tube in 120 adult Sprague–Dawley rats (60 males and 60 females) at the same age. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was started after 5 min of untreated cardiac arrest. Animals were randomized into one of the three post resuscitation care intervention groups (n = 40, 20 males) immediately after resuscitation: (1) normothermic control (NC): ventilated with 2% N(2)/98% O(2) for 1 h under normothermia; (2) targeted temperature management (TTM): ventilated with 2% N(2)/98% O(2) for 1 h under hypothermia; (3) hydrogen inhalation (HI): ventilated with 2% H(2)/98% O(2) for 1 h under normothermia. Physiological variables were recorded during the 5 h post resuscitation monitoring period. Neurological deficit score (NDS) and accumulative survival were used to assess 96 h outcomes. Mutual independence analysis and Mantel–Haenszel stratified analysis were used to explore the associations among gender, intervention and survival. RESULTS: The body weights of female rats were significantly lighter than males, but CPR characteristics did not differ between genders. Compared with male rats, females had significantly lower mean arterial pressure, longer onset time of the electroencephalogram (EEG) burst and time to normal EEG trace (TTNT) in the NC group; relatively longer TTNT in the TTM group; and substantially longer TTNT, lower NDSs, and higher survival in the HI group. Mutual independence analysis revealed that both gender and intervention were associated with neurological outcome. Mantel–Haenszel stratified analysis demonstrated that female rats had significantly higher survival rate than males when adjusted for the confounder intervention. CONCLUSION: In this rat model cardiac arrest and CPR, gender did not affect resuscitation but associated with neurological outcome. The superiority of female rats in neurological recovery was affected by post resuscitation interventions and female rats were more likely to benefit from hydrogen therapy.

21447,AUTHOR REPLY,2021-08-11,"Hypertension contributes to a quarter of all-cause mortality in China. The Chinese government has put forward aims to control and prevent hypertension, and China CDC and other professional public health institutions have carried out a series of related efforts including the promotion of related policies and legislation, the improvement of modifiable risk factors of hypertension in the population, and promoting the National Primary Public Health Services to discover and manage patients with hypertension. China CDC has conducted multiple hypertension-related campaigns such as advocating for salt reduction, weight loss, and increased physical activity. Additionally, on behalf of the Chinese government, China CDC has organized and carried out the construction of national demonstration areas for the comprehensive prevention and control of chronic diseases. As of 2020, 488 national demonstration areas have been established, covering 17.1% of all counties and districts. In these areas, the lifestyle and health literacy of the population and community-based hypertension management measures have been improved. The Healthy China 2030 calls for a transition from disease treatment to a focus on health, which requires a strategy of hypertension prevention and control that focuses on the whole population rather than on high-risk populations. The Primary Health Care, Medicine and Health Promotion Law was officially implemented on June 1, 2020 and provides the legal basis for this strategy change in the prevention and control of hypertension. Ongoing public health legislation should involve non-communicable diseases such as hypertension in addition to communicable diseases.","Hou, Lei; Chen, Bo; Ji, Yibing; Wang, Baohua; Wu, Jing",China CDC Wkly,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8393031/,192
21616,Clean Label in Bread,2021-08-31,"Epithelial cell-activating molecule (EpCAM) is an important cancer biomarker and therapeutic target given its elevated expression in epithelial cancers. EpCAM is a type I transmembrane protein that forms cis-dimers along the thyroglobulin type-1A-like domain (TYD) in the extracellular region. The thyroglobulin loop (TY loop) within the TYD is structurally dynamic in the monomer state of human EpCAM, binding reversibly to a TYD site. However, it is not known if this flexibility is prevalent across different species. Here, we conduct over 17 μs of all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to study EpCAM TY loop kinetics of five different species, including human, mouse, chicken, frog, and fish. We find that the TY loop remains dynamic across evolution. In addition to the TYD binding site, we discover a second binding site for the TY loop in the C-terminal domain (CTD). Calculations of the dissociation rate constants from the simulation trajectories suggest a differential binding pattern of fish EpCAM and other organisms. Whereas fish TY loop has comparable binding for both TYD and CTD sites, the TY loops of other species preferably bind the TYD site. A hybrid construct of fish EpCAM with human TY loop restores the TYD binding preference, suggesting robust effects of the TY loop sequence on its dynamic behavior. Our findings provide insights into the structural dynamics of EpCAM and its implication in physiological functions.","Chen, Serena H.; Bell, David R.",Life (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8467770/,192
22024,Comparison of polynomial fitting versus single time point analysis of ECIS data for barrier assessment,2021-10-04,"Transcriptomics provides valuable data for functional annotations of genes, the discovery of biomarkers, and quantitative assessment of responses to challenges. Meta-analysis of Nofima’s Atlantic salmon microarray database was performed for the selection of genes that have shown strong and reproducible expression changes. Using data from 127 experiments including 6440 microarrays, four transcription modules (TM) were identified with a total of 902 annotated genes: 161 virus responsive genes – VRG (activated with five viruses and poly I:C), genes that responded to three pathogenic bacteria (523 up and 33 down-regulated genes), inflammation not caused by infections – wounds, melanized foci in skeletal muscle and exposure to PAMP (180 up and 72 down-regulated genes), and stress by exercise, crowding and cortisol implants (33 genes). To assist the selection of gene markers, genes in each TM were ranked according to the scale of expression changes. In terms of functional annotations, association with diseases and stress was unknown or not reflected in public databases for a large part of genes, including several genes with the highest ranks. A set of multifunctional genes was discovered. Cholesterol 25-hydroxylase was present in all TM and 22 genes, including most differentially expressed matrix metalloproteinases 9 and 13 were assigned to three TMs. The meta-analysis has improved understanding of the defense strategies in Atlantic salmon. VRG have demonstrated equal or similar responses to RNA (SAV, IPNV, PRV, and ISAV), and DNA (gill pox) viruses, injection of bacterial DNA (plasmid) and exposure of cells to PAMP (CpG and gardiquimod) and relatively low sensitivity to inflammation and bacteria. Genes of the highest rank show preferential expression in erythrocytes. This group includes multigene families (gig and several trim families) and many paralogs. Of pathogen recognition receptors, only RNA helicases have shown strong expression changes. Most VRG (82%) are effectors with a preponderance of ubiquitin-related genes, GTPases, and genes of nucleotide metabolism. Many VRG have unknown roles. The identification of TMs makes possible quantification of responses and assessment of their interactions. Based on this, we are able to separate pathogen-specific responses from general inflammation and stress.","Krasnov, Aleksei; Johansen, Lill-Heidi; Karlsen, Christian; Sveen, Lene; Ytteborg, Elisabeth; Timmerhaus, Gerrit; Lazado, Carlo C.; Afanasyev, Sergey",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8490804/,192

However, non-English-language science is expected to bring unique and valuable scientific information, especially in disciplines where the evidence is patchy, and for emergent issues where synthesising available evidence is an urgent challenge. Yet such contribution of non-English-language science to scientific communities and the application of science is rarely quantified. Here, we show that non-English-language studies provide crucial evidence for informing global biodiversity conservation. By screening 419,679 peer-reviewed papers in 16 languages, we identified 1,234 non-English-language studies providing evidence on the effectiveness of biodiversity conservation interventions, compared to 4,412 English-language studies identified with the same criteria. Relevant non-English-language studies are being published at an increasing rate in 6 out of the 12 languages where there were a sufficient number of relevant studies. Incorporating non-English-language studies can expand the geographical coverage (i.e., the number of 2° × 2° grid cells with relevant studies) of English-language evidence by 12% to 25%, especially in biodiverse regions, and taxonomic coverage (i.e., the number of species covered by the relevant studies) by 5% to 32%, although they do tend to be based on less robust study designs. Our results show that synthesising non-English-language studies is key to overcoming the widespread lack of local, context-dependent evidence and facilitating evidence-based conservation globally. We urge wider disciplines to rigorously reassess the untapped potential of non-English-language science in informing decisions to address other global challenges.

22175,Pushing and pulling,2005-01-01,"Previously, it was reported that multiple patients had hemolytic anemia associated with cimetidine administration, while only one patient who had received intravenous cimetidine was serologically diagnosed with drug-induced immune hemolytic anemia (DIIHA) caused by cimetidine-dependent antibodies. However, the ability of oral cimetidine intake to induce the production of antibodies has not been examined. In this study, we report a 44-year-old male patient in whom oral cimetidine administration resulted in cimetidine-dependent antibodies and drug-independent non-specific antibodies, leading to the development of DIIHA. Serological tests showed that the results of direct antiglobulin test (DAT) for anti-IgG (3+) and anti-C3d (1+) were positive. The IgM and IgG cimetidine-dependent antibodies (the highest total titer reached 4,096) were detected in the plasma incubated with O-type RBCs and 1 mg/mL cimetidine or the plasma incubated with cimetidine-coated RBCs. IgG-type drug-independent non-specific antibodies were detected in blood samples collected at days 13, 34, 41, and 82 post-drug intake. This is the first study to report that oral administration of cimetidine can elicit the production of cimetidine-dependent antibodies, leading to DIIHA, and the production of drug-independent non-specific antibodies, resulting in hemolytic anemia independent of cimetidine. Presence of pathogenic antibodies were detectable longer than 41 days. This suggests that patients with DIIHA caused by cimetidine need to be given necessary medical monitoring within 41 days after cimetidine intake.","Wu, Yuanjun; Wu, Yong; Ji, Yanli; Liu, Yanhui; Wu, Dongsheng; Liang, Jiajie; Guo, Ganping; Chen, Baochan",Front Med (Lausanne),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8504253/,192

22630,Annual Meeting Abstracts,1983,"BACKGROUND: Limited data exist regarding the impact of human bocavirus (BoV) in hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients. We examined incidence and disease spectrum of BoV respiratory tract infection (RTI) in HCT recipients. METHODS: In a longitudinal surveillance study of viral RTIs among allogeneic HCT recipients, pre-HCT and weekly post-HCT nasal washes and symptom surveys were collected through day 100, then every 3 months, and whenever respiratory symptoms occurred through 1-year post-HCT. Samples were tested by multiplex semi-quantitative PCR for RSV, parainfluenza virus 1–4, influenza A/B, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus, coronavirus, and BoV. Plasma samples from BoV+ subjects were analyzed by PCR. In addition, we conducted a retrospective review of HCT recipients with BoV detected in bronchoalveolar lavage or lung biopsy. RESULTS: Among 469 patients in the prospective cohort, 21 distinct BoV RTIs (3 pre-HCT and 18 post-HCT) were observed by 1-year post-HCT in 19 patients (median 42 years old, range 0–67) without apparent seasonality. BoV was more frequently detected in the latter half of the first 100 days post-HCT (Figure 1). The frequencies of respiratory symptoms in patients with BoV detected did not appear to be higher than those without any virus detected, with the exception of watery eyes (P < 0.01) (Figure 2). Univariable models among patients with BoV RTI post-HCT showed higher peak viral load in nasal samples (P = 0.04) and presence of respiratory copathogens (P = 0.03) were associated with presence of respiratory symptoms; however, BoV detection in plasma was not (P = 0.8). Retrospective review identified 6 allogeneic HCT recipients (range 1–64 years old) with BoV detected in lower respiratory tract specimens [incidence rate of 0.4% (9/2,385) per sample tested]. Although all 6 cases presented with hypoxemia, 4 had significant respiratory copathogens or concomitant conditions that contributed to respiratory compromise. No death was attributed mainly to BoV lower RTI. CONCLUSION: BoV is infrequently detected in respiratory tract in HCT recipients. Our studies did not demonstrate convincing evidence that BoV is a significant pathogen in either upper or lower respiratory tracts. Watery eyes were associated with BoV detection.

A diverse group of scientists met in Hawaii in March 2005 to discuss the linked social and ecological contexts in which infectious diseases emerge. A subset of the meeting was a group that focused on “transdisciplinary approaches” to integrating knowledge across and beyond academic disciplines in order to improve prevention and control of emerging infections. This article is based on the discussions of that group. Here, we outline the epidemiological legacy that has dominated infectious disease research and control up until now, and introduce the role of new, transdisciplinary and systems-based approaches to emerging infectious diseases.

Determining the minimum dose of virus particles that can initiate infection, termed the minimum infective dose (MID), is important for the development of risk assessment models in the fields of food and water treatment and the implementation of appropriate infection control strategies in healthcare settings. Both respiratory and enteric viruses can be shed at high titers from infected individuals even when the infection is asymptomatic. Presence of pre-existing antibodies has been shown to affect the infectious dose and to be protective against reinfection for many, but not all viruses. Most respiratory viruses appear to be as infective in humans as in tissue culture. Doses of <1 TCID(50) of influenza virus, rhinovirus, and adenovirus were reported to infect 50% of the tested population. Similarly, low doses of the enteric viruses, norovirus, rotavirus, echovirus, poliovirus, and hepatitis A virus, caused infection in at least some of the volunteers tested. A number of factors may influence viruses’ infectivity in experimentally infected human volunteers. These include host and pathogen factors as well as the experimental methodology.

An Indirect Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (indirect ELISA) was developed for detection of SARS- or SL-CoV infections in bat populations. The detection of 573 bat sera with this indirect ELISA demonstrated that SL-CoVs consistently circulate in Rhinilophus species, further supporting the proposal that bats are natural reservoirs of SL-CoVs. This method uses 1–2 μl of serum sample and can be used for preliminary screening of infections by SARS- or SL-CoV with a small amount of serum sample.","Yuan, Jun-fa; Li, Yan; Zhang, Hua-jun; Zhou, Peng; Ke, Zhen-hua; Zhang, Yun-zhi; Shi, Zheng-li",Virol Sin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7090808/,192
22902,Research highlights,2005-09-21,"Streptococcus mutans plays an important role in the development of dental caries in humans by synthesizing adhesive insoluble glucans from sucrose by mutansucrase activity. To explore the anti-cariogenic characteristics of rubusoside (Ru), a natural sweetener component in Rubus suavissimus S. Lee (Rosaceae), we investigated the inhibitory effect of Ru against the activity of mutansucrase and the growth of Streptococcus mutans. Ru (50 mM) showed 97% inhibitory activity against 0.1 U/mL mutansucrase of S. mutans with 500 mM sucrose. It showed competitive inhibition with a K(i) value of 1.1 ± 0.2 mM and IC(50) of 2.3 mM. Its inhibition activity was due to hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding interactions based on molecular docking analysis. Ru inhibited the growth of S. mutans as a bacteriostatic agent, with MIC and MBC values of 6 mM and 8 mM, respectively. In addition, Ru showed synergistic anti-bacterial activity when it was combined with curcumin. Therefore, Ru is a natural anti-cariogenic agent with anti-mutansucrase activity and antimicrobial activity against S. mutans.

22924,Abstracts DGPPN 2007,2006-11-30,"The advent of severe acute respiratory syndrome and its potential environmental transmission indicates the need for more information on the survival of coronavirus in water and wastewater. The survival of representative coronaviruses, feline infectious peritonitis virus, and human coronavirus 229E was determined in filtered and unfiltered tap water (4 and 23°C) and wastewater (23°C). This was compared to poliovirus 1 under the same test conditions. Inactivation of coronaviruses in the test water was highly dependent on temperature, level of organic matter, and presence of antagonistic bacteria. The time required for the virus titer to decrease 99.9% (T(99.9)) shows that in tap water, coronaviruses are inactivated faster in water at 23°C (10 days) than in water at 4°C (>100 days). Coronaviruses die off rapidly in wastewater, with T(99.9) values of between 2 and 4 days. Poliovirus survived longer than coronaviruses in all test waters, except the 4°C tap water.","Gundy, Patricia M.; Gerba, Charles P.; Pepper, Ian L.",Food Environ Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7091381/,192

Although cells vary greatly in their appearance or size, their structure is basically similar. Even the plant and animal cells show a significant degree of similarity in their overall organization. There are two types of cells: eukaryotic and prokaryotic. The main difference between them is the method of genetic material storage: in eukaryotic cells — in an isolated nucleus, in prokaryotic cells — directly in the cytoplasm (there is no nucleus). Prokaryotic cells are usually independent (unicellular), while eukaryotic cells are often found in multicellular organisms.","Widłak, Wiesława",Molecular Biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7115002/,192
23659,"Detection, Occurence And Isolation",2007,"Common respiratory viruses are now recognised as true opportunistic respiratory pathogens in patients with haematological malignancies. The epidemiology of these viruses has not been extensively studied in immunocompromised hosts, but is probably closely related to viral activity in immunocompetent hosts, who constitute the virus reservoir for immunocompromised patients. In these patients, common respiratory viruses may cause severe infections with higher rates of progression to pneumonia and mortality compared to immunocompetent individuals. Prolonged high-titre viral shedding is common in patients with haematological malignancies and may enhance not only viral transmission, but also the selection of resistant strains. Influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections have been particularly well studied. They are associated with pneumonia rates of about one-third for influenza and 30–40% for RSV. Both viruses are responsible for mortality rates ranging from 15% to 30%. The exact mechanisms of pneumonia related to these viruses remains unknown, but bacterial and fungal co-infections are frequent and must be carefully investigated. Parainfluenza viruses (PIV) and RSV have also been linked to late airflow obstruction in haematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients. Neuraminidase inhibitor therapy has been suggested for influenza, ribavirin for RSV, and cidofovir for adenovirus infections. However, there is no evidence supporting the use of these drugs, and randomised controlled trials are urgently needed to better define the optimal management of common viral pneumonia in patients with haematological malignancies. The absence of proven effective treatments highlights the critical importance of prevention. Viral transmission may be interrupted by contact isolation with droplet precautions for infected patients and by having patients and health care workers with suspected infection, and their relatives, refrain from visits and work. Immunisation remains the cornerstone of influenza prevention and is recommended for patients with haematological malignancies, their relatives, and health care workers.","Schnell, David; Legoff, Jérôme; Azoulay, Élie",Pulmonary Involvement in Patients with Hematological Malignancies,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7115022/,192

The analysis of RNA or DNA helps to diagnose infectious diseases and identify genetic determined disorders or even cancer. Starting from mono-parametric tests within the last years, technologies have evolved that allow for the detection of many parameters in parallel, e.g., by using multiplex nucleic acid amplification techniques, microarrays, or next-generation sequencing technologies. The introduction of closed-tube systems as well as lab-on-a-chip devices further resulted in a higher automation degree with a reduced contamination risk. These applications complement or even stepwise replace classical methods in clinical microbiology like virus cultures, resistance determination, microscopic and metabolic analyses, as well as biochemical or immunohistochemical assays. In addition, novel diagnostic markers appear, like noncoding RNAs and miRNAs providing additional room for novel biomarkers. This article provides an overview of microarrays as diagnostics devices and research tools. Introduced in 1995 for transcription analysis, microarrays are used today to detect several different biomolecules like DNA, RNA, miRNA, and proteins among others. Mainly used in research, some microarrays also found their way to clinical diagnostics. Further, closed lab-on-a-chip devices that use DNA microarrays as detection tools are discussed, and additionally, an outlook toward applications of next-generation sequencing tools in diagnostics will be given.","Lemuth, Karin; Rupp, Steffen",RNA and DNA Diagnostics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120549/,192

24640,Optimization of Ligand Surface Concentration for Biosensor based on Imaging Ellipsometry,2010,"Antigen presentation by major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) and class II (MHC-II) molecules is a prerequisite for T cell engagement during the activation as well as the effector phase. The central nervous system (CNS) is unique in that cells resident in the parenchyma, glia and neurons, do not constitutively (or very sparsely at best) express MHC molecules (Aloisi et al., 2000; Sedgwick and Hickey, 1997; Xiao and Link, 1998), making them invisible to T cells. Additional restrictions on T cell surveillance are imposed by the absence of classical lymphatic drainage, the blood—brain barrier (BBB), and the unique anatomy of the brain microvasculature (Bechmann et al., 2007; Galea et al., 2007; Hickey, 2001; Xiao and Link, 1998; Lowenstein, 2002). Infiltrating cells not only have to cross the vascular wall to penetrate into the perivascular space, but more importantly overcome the barrier formed by the glia limitans to access the CNS parenchyma. While the first step is generally not associated with pathology, penetration from the perivascular space of postcapillary venules into the parenchyma is more restricted and once overcome, associated with clinical consequences (Bechmann et al., 2007). In the resting state, perivascular macrophages are maintained by replacement with circulating monocytes. However the glial limitans is not breached, and thus, these cells are considered to be located outside the confines of the BBB. While diffusion of soluble factors and antibodies is restricted by the BBB, especially by the tight, continuous, unfenestrated capillary epithelium, leukocyte infiltration preferentially occurs at distal sites in postcapillary venules (Bechmann et al., 2007). BBB permeability and leukocyte infiltration are thus not necessarily functionally nor physically linked. The barriers separating CNS parenchyma from the circulation explains the rare presence of T cells in the normal CNS parenchyma, despite the ability of peripherally activated and memory T cells to traffic to non lymphoid tissues independent of antigen presentation (Masopust et al., 2004). Nevertheless, T cells activated during an infection or auto-immune response, are able to enter into, and migrate within the brain parenchyma, even in the presence of an intact, non-inflamed BBB (Cabarrocas et al., 2003; Chen et al., 2005; Evans et al., 1996; Hickey, 2001). However, although entry of activated T cells into the CNS is independent of their antigen specificity, only those T cells that recognize antigen are retained. Thus, barriers limiting T cell surveillance of the brain are rapidly overcome following CNS infections and other inflammatory conditions (Griffin, 2003; Ransohoff et al., 2003). Under such conditions, it is also likely that a number of non-activated, bystander T cells, as well as other leukocytes, including B cells are able to penetrate into the brain parenchyma. Mechanisms propagating protective versus pathogenic potential of T cells in varying disease models are complex and require more in depth exploration. This chapter highlights recent advances relating to antigen presentation functions by resident CNS cells and effects exerted by CD8 T cells in vivo with an emphasis on anti-viral functions.","Bergmann, Cornelia; Lowenstein, Pedro",Central Nervous System Diseases and Inflammation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121023/,192

Methods: This chapter will review previous literature and newer results concerning the possible roles of CMV, other herpesviruses, community-acquired respiratory viruses, bacteria (including Pseudomonas, other gram-negative, gram-positive, and atypical organisms), and fungi, including colonization as well as invasive infection. Results: The text reviews and evaluates the body of literature supporting a role for these infectious agents as risk factors for BOS and time to BOS. Changing patterns of infection over time are taken into account, and studies that have shown an association between BOS (or lack thereof) and CMV are reviewed. Strategies for prevention or early treatment of infections are discussed as potential means of preserving allograft function long term. Immunizations, stringent infection-control practices, and antimicrobial treatment including newer therapies will be discussed. Conclusion: In addition to the classic literature that has focused on CMV, an expanding spectrum of infectious organisms has been implicated as possible risk factors for BOS.

Unfortunately, the etiology of the illness remains obscure, although recent studies favor a possible viral etiology.","Mason, Wilbert",Pediatric Infectious Diseases Revisited,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123123/,192

However, this hormone is more than a simple marker of stress levels—it is necessary for the correct functioning of almost every part of the body. Excesses or deficiencies of this crucial hormone also lead to various physical symptoms and disease states [1]. Although cortisol is not essential for life per se, it helps an organism to cope more efficiently with its environment with particular metabolic actions on glucose production and protein and fat catabolism. Nevertheless, loss or profound diminishment of cortisol secretion leads to a state of abnormal metabolism and an inability to deal with stressors, which, if untreated, may be fatal [1, 2].","Caramori, Gaetano; Mumby, Sharon; Girbino, Giuseppe; Chung, Kian Fan; Adcock, Ian M.",Nijkamp and Parnham's Principles of Immunopharmacology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123613/,192

28402,"Contesting the (Super)Natural Origins of Ebola in Macenta, Guinea: Biomedical and Popular Approaches",2019-10-12,"ISSUE: A proactive Legionella control program combining continuous disinfection of the water distribution system, environmental sampling and active case detection was established in a large urban hospital in the early 1990's. While cases of community-acquired disease are generally seen in the area during the rainy spring months, no patients had been identified with hospital acquired infection until Sept. 2005, after a particularly hot, dry summer. PROJECT: In order to prevent additional infections, all systems were immediately reviewed. Routine cultures of hospital sinks and showers had occasionally shown low levels of Legionella pneumophila in less than 30% of samples collected. There were no disruptions in the water supply and readings from the copper-silver ionization system were within range. Although the hospital's hot water supply is disinfected by the system, the cold water supply is not treated since the cooler water is not considered to be at increased risk for Legionella multiplication. After the case was identified, cultures were collected from additional water sources, including the new state of the art ice and water dispenser that served the patient unit. Maintenance personnel provided documentation that the unit was cleaned and sanitized as per manufacturer's instructions and provided the service manual for review. RESULTS: Cultures collected from the dispenser's water chute showed confluent growth of Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1. Isolates from the environment and patient submitted to a reference lab for Pulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) had identical patterns. Periodic cleaning procedures in the manual stated that a chlorinated cleaning solution (200 ppm available chlorine) should be used, followed by a sanitizing solution (50 ppm). Since this sequence was reversed from our usual disinfection practices, the manufacturer of the recommended cleaner was contacted. The company was unaware that their product was mentioned and confirmed that these steps were incorrectly listed. Another factor leading to the disinfection failure was identified- maintenance personnel did not realize that the solutions were to be 75°F-125°F. LESSONS LEARNED: During the hot summer months, water coming in from the municipal water supply was reported to be unusually warm, theoretically allowing small numbers of Legionella in the water to multiply. While the preventative maintenance schedule was being followed according to the manufacturer's instructions, the incorrect dilution sequence and low temperature of the solution used potentially allowed the interior surfaces of the machine to develop a biofilm layer containing Legionella - a problem common in our hard water area. While we thought that our high-tech, proactive system was working wonderfully, all it took was a cool drink on a hot day to break our winning streak of Legionella prevention. And an unfortunate patient with a history of aspiration.","Krystofiak, S.P.",Am J Infect Control,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7135536/,192

Surprisingly, we observe through experiments that even in-domain training with standard unsupervised representation learning techniques leads to poor results. We argue that, because of their structured nature, diagram images require more specially-tailored learning objectives. We propose a new method for unsupervised adaptation of out-of-domain feature extractors that asks the model to reason about spatial context. Specifically, we fine-tune a pre-trained image encoder by requiring it to correctly predict the relative orientation between pairs of nearby image regions. Experiments on the recently released Ikea Diagram Dataset show that our proposed method leads to substantial improvements on a downstream search task, more than doubling recall for certain query categories in the dataset.","Jhamtani, Harsh; Berg-Kirkpatrick, Taylor",Advances in Information Retrieval,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7148009/,192

Besides, non-sensor derived images such as illustrations, data visualizations, figures, etc. are typically used to convey complex information or to explore large datasets. However, this kind of images has received little attention in computer vision. CNNs and similar techniques use large volumes of training data. Currently, many document analysis systems are trained in part on scene images due to the lack of large datasets of educational image data. In this paper, we address this issue and present SlideImages, a dataset for the task of classifying educational illustrations. SlideImages contains training data collected from various sources, e.g., Wikimedia Commons and the AI2D dataset, and test data collected from educational slides. We have reserved all the actual educational images as a test dataset in order to ensure that the approaches using this dataset generalize well to new educational images, and potentially other domains. Furthermore, we present a baseline system using a standard deep neural architecture and discuss dealing with the challenge of limited training data.","Morris, David; Müller-Budack, Eric; Ewerth, Ralph",Advances in Information Retrieval,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7148059/,192

The existing Chinese NER methods are mostly based on word segmentation, or use the character sequences as input. However, using a single granularity representation would suffer from the problems of out-of-vocabulary and word segmentation errors, and the semantic content is relatively simple. In this paper, we introduce the self-attention mechanism into the BiLSTM-CRF neural network structure for Chinese named entity recognition with two embedding. Different from other models, our method combines character and word features at the sequence level, and the attention mechanism computes similarity on the total sequence consisted of characters and words. The character semantic information and the structure of words work together to improve the accuracy of word boundary segmentation and solve the problem of long-phrase combination. We validate our model on MSRA and Weibo corpora, and experiments demonstrate that our model can significantly improve the performance of the Chinese NER task.","Chang, Ning; Zhong, Jiang; Li, Qing; Zhu, Jiang",Advances in Information Retrieval,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7148203/,192

While most of the current approaches for cross-modal retrieval revolve around learning how to represent text and images in a shared latent space, we take a different direction: we propose to generalize the cross-modal relevance feedback mechanism, a simple yet effective unsupervised method, that relies on standard information retrieval heuristics and the choice of a few hyper-parameters. We show that we can cast it as a supervised representation learning problem on graphs, using graph convolutions operating jointly over text and image features, namely cross-modal graph convolutions. The proposed architecture directly learns how to combine image and text features for the ranking task, while taking into account the context given by all the other elements in the set of images to be (re-)ranked. We validate our approach on two datasets: a public dataset from a MediaEval challenge, and a small sample of proprietary image search query logs, referred as WebQ.

29154,Urocyon littoralis,1995-06-23,"The emerging field of animal studies has a curious relationship with environmentalism. Instead of fitting comfortably in the latter’s capacious tent, animal studies has chafed at environmentalists’ commitment to holistic communitarianism best represented by Aldo Leopold’s “land ethic.” The land ethic approaches the biotic community as a pyramidal ecological system that turns on the relations between producers and consumers and between predators and prey rather than as an egalitarian moral community. Animal rights activists have thus repeatedly clashed with conservationists in an internecine fight poignantly dramatized in T.C. Boyle’s novel When the Killing’s Done (2011). In this paper, I argue that environmental justice cannot be secured solely from the third-person perspective of the deontological argument underlying animal rights or the utilitarian argument often used to justify the land ethic. Instead, we might draw on the pragmatist traditions East and West and view justice as a larger loyalty achieved as much by the moral imagination of the particular from the first- and second-person perspectives as by rational deliberation on the universal. Using a French novel (The Roots of Heaven, 1958), a Chinese novel (The Disappearance of Lao Hai, 2001), and a Chinese film (Monster Hunt, 2015) as my examples, I demonstrate how literature’s thick narratives can engender an ethics of care by bringing particular instances of non-human distress into aesthetic, affective, and moral proximity with us.","Lee, Haiyan",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7149134/,192

In this study, we undertook a farm survey in Finland employing a choice experiment to study the willingness to pay for animal disease insurance products. We found that producers’ willingness to pay for animal disease insurance is relatively low, even if consequential losses are covered. However, attributes of the insurance products which increased the likelihood of the producer wishing to purchase the product in a statistically significant manner were identified. The most important attribute was a low deductible. Using latent class analysis, four classes of producers were identified, those who were (1) not interested, (2) weakly interested or (3) strongly interested in insurance, and additionally, (4) a group who emphasised biosecurity measures but was not willing to purchase insurance. Those primarily interested in insurance were typically young, well-educated producers from large farms, and they already had a good level of biosecurity on their farms. However, the majority of the respondents preferred not to purchase insurance. The analysis suggests that commercial production animal disease insurance may need to be subsidised or otherwise made more attractive to producers, and even so, many producers might consider it unnecessary.","Heikkilä, Jaakko; Niemi, Jarkko K.; Heinola, Katriina; Liski, Eero; Myyrä, Sami",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7149207/,192

Since tumor cells are poor antigen-presenting cells, cross-presentation of tumor antigens by dendritic cells (DCs) is essential for the generation of tumor-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte responses. A number of polymer-based nanomedicines have been developed to deliver genes into DCs, primarily by incorporating tumor-specific, antigen-encoding plasmid DNA with polycationic molecules to facilitate DNA loading and intracellular trafficking. Direct in vivo targeting of plasmid DNA to DC surface receptors can induce high transfection efficiency and long-term gene expression, essential for antigen loading onto major histocompatibility complex molecules and stimulation of T-cell responses. This chapter summarizes the physicochemical properties and biological information on polymer-based non-viral vectors used for targeting DCs, and discusses the main challenges for successful in vivo gene transfer into DCs.","David, Ayelet; Golani-Armon, Adi",Nanomedicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7153417/,192

Previous investigations indicated that spectral interferences exist in the analysis of CsA blood samples by the above methods. In TOF‐SIMS, interference is caused by overlap of the Ag‐cationized internal standard, cyclosporin D (CsD), with the Ag‐cationized metabolite, AM1. To resolve this interference and obtain quantitative information, cross‐correlation analysis was applied to the TOF‐SIMS data. Application of damped non‐linear least squares curve‐fitting was carried out to resolve an interference in the MALDI/TOF‐MS data due to multiple cationization products (i.e. Na and K). Measurement of standard samples indicates that the minimum accuracy (95% confidence level) of the TOF‐SIMS method was better than 9% for CsA and 13% for AM1 using only one standard curve'. Similarly, the minimum accuracy of the MALDI/TOF‐MS method was determined to be 14% for CsA and better than 25% for AM1. Blood samples obtained from transplant patients receiving CsA were analyzed by polyclonal fluorescence polarization immunoassay, high‐performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and by both TOF‐MS methods. Both TOF‐MS results for CsA and mono‐hydroxylated CsA are in good agreement with the HPLC results.","Muddiman, David C.; Gusev, Arkady I.; Karl‐Stoppek‐Langner,; Proctor, Andrew; Hercules, David M.; Tata, Prasad; Venkataramanan, Raman; Diven, Warren",J Mass Spectrom,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7167202/,192

Motivated by modern communication networks spanning multiple providers, we show for the first time how multiple mutually-distrusting parties can successfully compute node EBC while revealing only differentially-private information about their internal network connections. A theoretical utility analysis upper bounds a primary source of private EBC error—private release of ego networks—with high probability. Empirical results demonstrate practical applicability with a low 1.07 relative error achievable at strong privacy budget [Formula: see text] on a Facebook graph, and insignificant performance degradation as the number of network provider parties grows.

32933,Comment,2020-05-26,"Reflective algorithms are algorithms that can modify their own behaviour. Recently a behavioural theory of reflective algorithms has been developed, which shows that they are captured by reflective abstract state machines (rASMs). Reflective ASMs exploit extended states that include an updatable representation of the ASM signature and rules to be executed by the machine in that state. Updates to the representation of ASM signatures and rules are realised by means of a sophisticated tree algebra defined in the background of the rASM. In this paper the theory is taken further by an extension of the logic of ASMs to capture inferences on rASMs. The key is the introduction of terms that are interpreted by ASM rules stored in some location. We show that fragments of the logic with a fixed bound on the number of steps preserve completeness, whereas the full run-logic for rASMs becomes incomplete.","Schewe, Klaus-Dieter; Ferrarotti, Flavio",Rigorous State-Based Methods,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7242046/,192
33133,Diary,2020-05-14,"For ordinary users, the task of accessing knowledge graphs through structured query languages like SPARQL is rather demanding. As a result, various approaches exploit the simpler and widely used keyword-based search paradigm, either by translating keyword queries to structured queries, or by adopting classical information retrieval (IR) techniques. In this paper, we study and adapt Elasticsearch, an out-of-the-box document-centric IR system, for supporting keyword search over RDF datasets. Contrary to other works that mainly retrieve entities, we opt for retrieving triples, due to their expressiveness and informativeness. We specify the set of functional requirements and study the emerging questions related to the selection and weighting of the triple data to index, and the structuring and ranking of the retrieved results. Finally, we perform an extensive evaluation of the different factors that affect the IR performance for four different query types. The reported results are promising and offer useful insights on how different Elasticsearch configurations affect the retrieval effectiveness and efficiency.","Kadilierakis, Giorgos; Fafalios, Pavlos; Papadakos, Panagiotis; Tzitzikas, Yannis",The Semantic Web,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7250595/,192

It shows striking ideational and institutional continuity and reveals a substantial character of European integration: by relying on powerful political framings and discourses, as well as on sturdy institutions, the European Community/Union was able to move into areas that were not sanctioned by the treaties. The chapter further argues that to stay relevant, the EU research policy must be capable of breaking with the past and dramatically expand its mission to embrace the social and environmental challenges of the twenty-first century. In fact, with the existential threat of climate change and other global challenges, and the urgent need for socio-technological transformation at scale, opportunities and imperatives for European level activity in research might be greater than ever.","Mitzner, Veera",European Union Research Policy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7262380/,192

Our experiment achieves fidelity to real-world settings because the tasks are taken from real-world video game development, and the subjects use domain frameworks as they are used in real-world developments. Our results challenge previous ideas that limit the benefits of MDD to academic exercises and to developers without experience.

To do so, we need clear definitions and operational criteria to determine what is a “transparent” classification system in our context. However, the term “transparency” is often left undefined in the literature, and there is a lack of operational criteria allowing to check whether a given algorithm deserves to be called “transparent” or not. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a definition of “transparency” for classification systems in medical contexts. We also propose several operational criteria to evaluate whether a classification system can be considered “transparent”. We apply these operational criteria to evaluate the “transparency” of several well-known classification systems.","Richard, Antoine; Mayag, Brice; Talbot, François; Tsoukias, Alexis; Meinard, Yves",Information Processing and Management of Uncertainty in Knowledge-Based Systems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7274704/,192

Four TIS variations were published in 2009: transposon sequencing (Tn-Seq), transposon-directed insertion site sequencing (TraDIS), insertion sequencing (INSeq) and high-throughput insertion tracking by deep sequencing (HITS). TIS has since become an important tool for molecular microbiologists, being one of the few genome-wide techniques that directly links phenotype to genotype and ultimately can assign gene function. In this Review, we discuss the recent applications of TIS to answer overarching biological questions.

34622,Eigenverwaltung als Option,2020-06-18,"This work examines performance characteristics of multiple shared-memory implementations of a probabilistic graphical modeling (PGM) optimization code, which forms the basis for an advanced, state-of-the art image segmentation method. The work is motivated by the need to accelerate scientific image analysis pipelines in use by experimental science, such as at x-ray light sources, and is motivated by the need for platform-portable codes that perform well across many different computational architectures. The primary focus of this work and its main contribution is an in-depth study of shared-memory parallel performance of different implementations, which include those using alternative parallelization approaches such as C11-threads, OpenMP, and data parallel primitives (DPPs). Our results show that, for this complex data-intensive algorithm, the DPP implementation exhibits better runtime performance, but also exhibits less favorable scaling characteristics than the C11-threads and OpenMP counterparts. Based upon a set of experiments that collect hardware performance counters on multiple platforms, the reason for the runtime performance difference appears to be due primarily to algorithmic efficiency gains: the reformulation from the traditional C11-threads and OpenMP expression of the solution into that of data parallel primitives results in significantly fewer instructions being executed. This study is the first of its type to do performance analysis using hardware counters for comparing methods based on VTK-m-based data-parallel primitives with those based on more traditional OpenMP or threads-based parallelism. It is timely, as there is increasing awareness of the need for platform portability in light of increasing node-level parallelism and increasing device heterogeneity.","Perciano, Talita; Heinemann, Colleen; Camp, David; Lessley, Brenton; Bethel, E.

In order to extract the semantics of web tables to produce machine-readable knowledge, one of the critical steps is table entity linking, which maps the mentions in table cells to their referent entities in knowledge bases. In this paper, we propose a novel model JHSTabEL, which converts table entity linking into a sequence decision problem and uses hybrid semantic features to disambiguate the mentions in web tables. This model captures local semantics of the mentions and entities from different semantic aspects, and then makes full use of the information of previously referred entities for the subsequent entity disambiguation. The decisions are made from a global perspective to jointly disambiguate the mentions in the same column.

35218,Number of Prefixes in Trace Monoids: Clique Polynomials and Dependency Graphs,2020-06-24,"We introduce a new neural network for Data Assimilation (DA). DA is the approximation of the true state of some physical system at a given time obtained combining time-distributed observations with a dynamic model in an optimal way. The typical assimilation scheme is made up of two major steps: a prediction and a correction of the prediction by including information provided by observed data. This is the so called prediction-correction cycle. Classical methods for DA include Kalman filter (KF). KF can provide a rich information structure about the solution but it is often complex and time-consuming. In operational forecasting there is insufficient time to restart a run from the beginning with new data. Therefore, data assimilation should enable real-time utilization of data to improve predictions. This mandates the choice of an efficient data assimilation algorithm. Due to this necessity, we introduce, in this paper, the Neural Assimilation (NA), a coupled neural network made of two Recurrent Neural Networks trained on forecasting data and observed data respectively. We prove that the solution of NA is the same of KF. As NA is trained on both forecasting and observed data, after the phase of training NA is used for the prediction without the necessity of a correction given by the observations. This allows to avoid the prediction-correction cycle making the whole process very fast. Experimental results are provided and NA is tested to improve the prediction of oxygen diffusion across the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB).","Arcucci, Rossella; Moutiq, Lamya; Guo, Yi-Ke",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7304751/,192

In this paper, we contribute to the theoretical foundations of these types of rewriting theory a number of conceptual and technical developments that permit to implement a universal theory of continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs) for stochastic rewriting systems. Our core mathematical concepts are a novel rule algebra construction for the relevant setting of rewriting rules with conditions, both in Double- and in Sesqui-Pushout semantics, augmented by a suitable stochastic mechanics formalism extension that permits to derive dynamical evolution equations for pattern-counting statistics.","Behr, Nicolas; Krivine, Jean",Graph Transformation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7314866/,192

Another challenge is to guarantee that an orchestration with correct input data terminates, and produces correct output data. This work proposes complex workflows, a data-centric model for crowdsourcing based on orchestration of concurrent tasks and higher order schemes. We consider termination (whether some/all runs of a complex workflow terminate) and correctness (whether some/all runs of a workflow terminate with data satisfying FO requirements). We show that existential termination/correctness are undecidable in general excepted for specifications with bounded recursion. However, universal termination/correctness are decidable when constraints on inputs are specified in a decidable fragment of FO, and are at least in [Formula: see text].","Bourhis, Pierre; Hélouët, Loïc; Miklos, Zoltan; Singh, Rituraj",Application and Theory of Petri Nets and Concurrency,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7324238/,192

37146,PRODUCTS,2020-07-23,"BACKGROUND: Although the diagnosis and management of chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is well documented in the literature, some aspects of the disease remain unclear. We aimed to further describe the natural history, prognostic factors, humanistic burden and uptake of traditional and alternative therapies in patients with CSU. METHODS: This was a prospective, cross-sectional analysis at a single centre. We reviewed patient medical records and conducted a survey in patients with CSU. RESULTS: 72 patients participated in the study with a median duration of CSU of 48 months. 30% of patients had symptoms that resolved in under 2 years with these patients trending towards an older age of onset of CSU (48 ± 17 years). 16% of patients had symptoms lasting 10 years or longer with these patients trending towards a younger age of onset (22 ± 16 years). Patients with a relapsing/remitting disease course (31%) and those with co-existing angioedema (57%) trended towards a longer median duration of CSU (96 and 50 months respectively) and were observed to have a higher proportion of patients reporting CSU duration of 10 years or longer (33% and 25%, p = 0.033 and p = 0.036 respectively). Patients with co-existing autoimmune/thyroid disease (19%) trended towards a shorter median duration of CSU (37 months). 54 patients (75%) reported sleep disturbance and 29 patients (43%) required emergency room visit(s) for symptomatic control. 84% of patients who trialed second generation antihistamines reported a response to treatment, while 73% of patients who trialed omalizumab reported a response to treatment. Patients using alternative medicine such as acupuncture, traditional Chinese medicine and naturopathic medicine had lower reported response rates (20–29%) to treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The natural history of CSU may be longer than previously reported with our study finding a median duration of symptoms of nearly 4 years with one-third of patients reporting a relapsing/remitting disease course. Younger age of onset, a relapsing/remitting disease course and angioedema may predict a longer duration of CSU, whereas older age of onset and co-existing autoimmune/thyroid disease may predict a shorter duration of CSU. Reported symptomatic benefit was higher from guidelines based pharmacologic therapy versus various alternative medicines.","Stepaniuk, Peter; Kan, Manstein; Kanani, Amin",Allergy Asthma Clin Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7371813/,192

At the time of writing, after three months since its outburst, we can hardly find any sign of a “broken camel”: indeed, it could have been the opportunity to collectively question the current regime of production and appropriation, exclusion and marketization characterizing this phase of unjust “rentified capitalism”, but the route taken has largely seen a frightening combination of “business as usual” on the production side and pervasive forms of social control, limitations of individual and collective rights and the perpetuation of a false dichotomy between economic and health security. This pandemic, which under decent public health provisions might have been a controlled disease, is producing the most severe crisis after the Great Depression and has been used to implement forms of massive social control hardly conceivable in “advanced democracies”. Butterfly effects are well-known in complexity sciences. However, social scientists have still difficulties in understanding how a grain can make the sandcastle fall down. On the contrary, we are now under the actual risk of starting a “new normal” without dealing with the deep routes and origins of this crisis, with the dominant intellectual discourse pushing for maintaining and indeed reinforcing the status quo, established power and social blocks.

Instead of following from the stands or on television fans are choosing to follow, for example, via social media. The emerging unified theory of brand equity offers a framework to examine the mediating role of attendance and local television and the moderating role of Twitter followers on the relationships between MLB marketing assets (MA) and team financial performance. Publicly available secondary data are analyzed with PLS-SEM. The results indicate attendance and local TV partially mediate the relationship between non-seasonal MA and team financial performance, whereas attendance and local TV fully mediate the relationship between in-season MA and team financial performance. Furthermore, the number of Twitter followers for each MLB team moderates various relationships within the MLB brand equity research model. Findings suggest MLB sales and marketing professionals should design ticket sales initiatives that not only promote attendance in the short-term but, more importantly, build upon non-seasonal sources of team brand equity for the long-term.

Many trauma surgeons consider it surgical dogma to avoid performing a TP during the index operation for patients with severe pancreatic or duodenal injuries. However, there is no modern analysis evaluating this belief. Therefore, we hypothesized no difference in risk of mortality between patients with severe pancreatic or duodenal injury undergoing a TP for penetrating trauma to propensity-matched controls undergoing laparotomy without TP. The Trauma Quality Improvement Program (2010–2016) was queried for adults with severe penetrating pancreatic or duodenal injuries undergoing laparotomy. A 1:2 propensity-matching including demographics/comorbidities, injury severity score, vitals on admission, Glasgow Coma Scale and concomitant injuries for laparotomy with or without TP was performed. Risk of mortality was reported using a univariable logistic regression model. Of 2182 patients with severe pancreatic or duodenal injuries undergoing laparotomy, 54 (2.5%) underwent TP and 2128 (97.5%) underwent laparotomy without TP. There were no differences in propensity-matching characteristics. Patients undergoing TP had a similar mortality rate (20.0% vs. 28.7%, p = 0.302) but a longer length of stay (LOS) (27.5 vs. 16.5 days, p = 0.017). The TP group had a similar associated risk of mortality (OR = 0.62, p = 0.302) but higher risk of major complications (OR 3.44, CI 1.35–17.47, p = 0.015). In appropriately selected penetrating trauma patients with severe pancreatic/duodenal injuries, TP is associated with a similar risk of mortality compared to laparotomy without TP. However, TP patients did have an increased associated risk of major complications and longer LOS.","Grigorian, A.; Dosch, A. R.; Delaplain, P. T.; Imagawa, D.; Jutric, Z.; Wolf, R.

As communities, organizations, and individuals have had to shift modalities during the pandemic, they have identified ways to sustain community well-being. Prior to COVID-19, colleges and universities were hailed as anchors of economic and social resilience and well-being for communities of place. In this light, this commentary highlights stories of rapid community innovation occurring at Hobart & William Smith Colleges in the Finger Lakes region of New York. A series of vignettes are presented showcasing lessons and on-going questions regarding rapid pivots, community values, and diversity and inclusion during (and after) the pandemic.

38434,Coronavirus What History Can Tell us About Tomorrow,2020-08-12,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: We aim to describe the pathophysiology, clinical findings, diagnosis, and treatment of deficiency of adenosine deaminase 2 (DADA2). RECENT FINDINGS: DADA2 is a multi-organ disease of children and less often adults, which can present with wide-ranging manifestations including strokes, medium vessel vasculitis, hematologic disease, and immunodeficiency. Diagnosis is through detection of reduced activity level of the adenosine deaminase 2 (ADA2) enzyme and/or identification of bi-allelic mutations in the ADA2 gene. Outside of high-dose glucocorticoids, conventional immunosuppression has been largely ineffective in treating this relapsing and remitting disease. Vasculitic-predominant manifestations respond extremely well to tumor necrosis factor-α inhibition. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation can lead to normalization of enzyme activity, as well as resolution of vasculitic, hematologic, and immunologic manifestations, although treatment-related adverse effects are not uncommon. SUMMARY: Early detection of this disease across multiple disciplines could prevent devastating clinical outcomes, especially in genetically pre-disposed populations.","Kendall, Jennifer Lee; Springer, Jason Michael",Curr Rheumatol Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7448703/,192

AIM: To analyze the rate of noninvasive ventilation failure and the main characteristics associated with this endpoint in oncohematological patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF). METHODS: A ventilatory support protocol was developed and implemented before the onset of the study. According to the PaO(2)/FiO(2) (P/F) ratio and clinical judgment, patients received supplementary oxygen therapy, NIMV, or invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). RESULTS: Eighty-two patients were included, average age between 52.1 ± 16 years old; 44 (53.6%) were male. The tested protocol was followed in 95.1% of cases. Six patients (7.3%) received IMV, 59 (89.7%) received NIMV, and 17 (20.7%) received oxygen therapy. ICU mortality rates were significantly higher in the IMV (83.3%) than in the NIMV (49.2%) and oxygen therapy (5.9%) groups (P < 0.001). Among the 59 patients who initially received NIMV, 30 (50.8%) had to eventually be intubated. Higher SOFA score at baseline (1.35 [95% CI = 1.12–2.10], P = 0.007), higher respiratory rate (RR) (1.10 [95% CI = 1.00–1.22], P = 0.048), and sepsis on admission (16.9 [95% CI = 1.93–149.26], P = 0.011) were independently associated with the need of orotracheal intubation among patients initially treated with NIMV. Moreover, NIMV failure was independently associated with ICU (P < 0.001) and hospital mortality (P = 0.049), and mortality between 6 months and 1 year (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The implementation of a NIMV protocol is feasible in patients with hematological neoplasia admitted to the ICU, even though its benefits still remain to be demonstrated. NIMV failure was associated with higher SOFA and RR and more frequent sepsis, and it was also related to poor prognosis.","Barreto, Lídia Miranda; Ravetti, Cecilia Gómez; Athaíde, Thiago Bragança; Bragança, Renan Detoffol; Pinho, Nathália Costa; Chagas, Lucas Vieira; de Lima Bastos, Fabrício; Nobre, Vandack",J Intensive Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7475950/,192
39053,Outside Front Cover,2020-12-01,"INTRODUCTION: In December 2019, a case series of pneumonia associated with seafood and wet animal market was reported as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, Hubei, China. The COVID-19 less frequently affects the pediatric group, and asymptomatic children are commonly reported. This feature is important due to the potential transmissibility of COVID-19 through these cases. There is a variety of atypical clinical symptoms and imaging manifestations among children infected with COVID-19. CASE PRESENTATION: We report two sisters with COVID-19 pneumonia who had close contact with their 77-year-old grandmother. Their grandmother expired with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. The older sister (15 years old) firstly presented with severe cough, fever, dyspnea, diarrhea, and lymphopenia. A chest computed tomography (CT) scan showed atypical lobar pneumonic infiltration only in the left lower lobe. The younger sister (6 years old) was affected the following day with milder symptoms (i.e., fever and cough). Her chest CT scan demonstrated typical mild generalized patchy ground-glass opacity with interlobular septal thickening scattered in both lungs. The CT presentation of their grandmother showed typical bilateral white lungs with crazy paving appearance. The standard regimen for both sisters was administrated, and the patients’ respiratory conditions improved after 5 days of treatment. Both cases were discharged with good general conditions. CONCLUSION: Children are considered potentially important causes of COVID-19 transmission. The symptoms in children are milder, and clinicians should be aware of taking a definite history of infected family members. Atypical clinical symptoms and imaging features are more common in children than adults; therefore, it is necessary to identify the typical and atypical imaging patterns of COVID-19 pneumonia in the pediatric population.","Gharekhanloo, Farideh; Sedighi, Iraj; Khazaei, Salman",Egypt J Radiol Nucl Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7479738/,192

Participants included 11 Asian international students who were enrolled in or recently graduated from school psychology programs in the USA. Thematic analysis revealed that Asian international school psychology students identified some assets they have brought to the program, including their diverse perspectives and experiences, awareness and commitment to social justice, and the potential to diversify the school psychology workforce. Participants also identified several challenges they were facing, such as acculturative stress, microaggression and discrimination, training program–related issues, and working restrictions related to their visa status. Moreover, they identified some effective strategies (i.e., seeking resources and increasing internal strengths) they have used to cope with these challenges. The findings provide important implications for school psychology graduate programs in the USA to improve the training experiences and training outcomes for international students from Asia and other countries.","Yang, Chunyan; Chen, Chun; Chan, Meiki; Wang, Cixin; Luo, Hua; Lin, Xueqin",Contemp Sch Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7483058/,192
39214,Products,2020-09-16,"PURPOSE: The relentless rise in antimicrobial resistance is a major societal challenge and requires, as part of its solution, a better understanding of bacterial colonization and infection. To facilitate this, we developed a highly efficient no-wash red optical molecular imaging agent that enables the rapid, selective, and specific visualization of Gram-positive bacteria through a bespoke optical fiber–based delivery/imaging endoscopic device. METHODS: We rationally designed a no-wash, red, Gram-positive-specific molecular imaging agent (Merocy-Van) based on vancomycin and an environmental merocyanine dye. We demonstrated the specificity and utility of the imaging agent in escalating in vitro and ex vivo whole human lung models (n = 3), utilizing a bespoke fiber–based delivery and imaging device, coupled to a wide-field, two-color endomicroscopy system. RESULTS: The imaging agent (Merocy-Van) was specific to Gram-positive bacteria and enabled no-wash imaging of S. aureus within the alveolar space of whole ex vivo human lungs within 60 s of delivery into the field-of-view, using the novel imaging/delivery endomicroscopy device. CONCLUSION: This platform enables the rapid and specific detection of Gram-positive bacteria in the human lung.

39384,The Potential Toxicity of Ozone: Side Effects and Contraindications of Ozonetherapy,2010-09-24,"PURPOSE: Sepsis has high incidence and mortality rates, particularly in the intensive care unit (ICU). Corticosteroids may improve outcomes, and vitamin C may add benefit. We aimed to assess whether vitamin C and corticosteroids improved outcomes compared with corticosteroids alone. METHODS: This historical cohort study (11 December 2016 to 21 February 2018) was conducted in the ICU of a quaternary referral hospital. Patients with an ICU admission diagnosis of sepsis or septic shock who received vitamin C and hydrocortisone within 72 hr were compared with those who received only hydrocortisone. All patients received standard sepsis care including source control, antibiotics, and fluid resuscitation. Most patients received thiamine as standard ICU care. The primary outcome was hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included ICU mortality, ventilator-free days, vasopressor-free days, dialysis use, and duration of ICU admission. RESULTS: One hundred and forty-four patients were included in the study. The mean (standard deviation [SD]) age was 64 (15) yr; 39% were female; and the mean (SD) Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation IV score was 89 (30). Eighty-eight patients did not receive vitamin C and 52 received vitamin C. There was no observed difference in hospital mortality between the non-vitamin C (36%) and vitamin C (39%) groups (adjusted odds ratio for hospital death, 0.52; 95% confidence interval, 0.20 to 1.34; P = 0.18). There were no statistically significant differences in any secondary outcomes. CONCLUSION: In this small observational study of ICU patients with septic shock, the addition of vitamin C to hydrocortisone therapy did significantly affect hospital mortality or other measures of mortality or organ dysfunction.","Chang, Kimberley; Harbin, Megan; Shuster, Constantin; Griesdale, Donald E.

40690,US: Cabot – carbon black,2020-10-09,"BACKGROUND: Global health has created new challenges for education and training of health professionals. Changing demand on humanitarian aid and infection control arising from the new corona virus outbreak, antimicrobial resistance, neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), immunisation gaps and care needs of refugees meet with conditions that are only since recently considered as major health threats, including gender inequality, health workforce shortage, environmental risks and climate change as well as poor mental health. These developments have resulted in high-level meetings and new policy frameworks, such as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, action on the ground has still to follow. Health professionals are poorly prepared to respond to new global health needs. Public health and healthcare systems face an urgent need to strengthen global health in the education and training of all groups of healthcare workers to create a future workforce, which is capable to implement the SDGs and serve the needs of the population both locally and globally. OBJECTIVES: This workshop addresses these questions and fosters critical debate. It has three major Objectives: improve advocacy for global health and the SDGs, introduce different models to support and implement global health and the SDGs in health professional education, and strengthen the role of public health in global health. The workshop brings together knowledge and expertise from different countries/regions of the world, professional groups and educational institutions. It seeks to build bridges between disciplines and stakeholder groups, including giving stronger voice to students and young professionals. The workshop illustrates diversity of advocacy and action in global health education, and reveals strong demand for multidisciplinary approaches to respond to population needs. It begins with information on competencies currently valued by global health employers in relation to those developed in graduates of public health programs. This is followed by novel models of global health education, including an institutional collaboration model as West-East hub and a students' driven participatory trans-sectoral model. Further case studies illustrate the benefits of a transdisciplinary approach to respond to major health threats, such as vaccine resistance and Ebola, and the need for including the Global South in gender sensitive research and methodology. The workshop will improve networking of global health advocates. It will add value through knowledge exchange beyond the professional silos, as well as across the global North-South/ East-West. Finally, it will strengthen connections between global health and public health and build capacity for multi-professional, trans-sectoral leadership in global health education and research, which is sensitive to gender and cultural/ethnic diversity. KEY MESSAGES: Strengthening global health competencies in education is a key to respond effectively to new public health challenges and to implement the SGDs. There is growing demand and urgent need for multidisciplinary approaches and transnational collaboration in global health education.",,Eur J Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7543531/,192

41888,The coronavirus response: Boxed in by models,2020-11-05,"CASE REPORT - INTRODUCTION: Bacterial and fungal infections are recognised complications of viral pneumonia, particularly in patients who are critically ill. We describe a case of fungal sacroiliitis complicating severe COVID-19 pneumonia following a prolonged intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Candida albicans sacroilitis is a rarely reported infection with few case reports in the literature. Candida osteoarticular infections can present as septic arthritis, with knee involvement in 75% of cases, or osteomyelitis. The latter presentation differs based on age - vertebral involvement (51%) is more common in adults while children are more likely to present with infection in the long bones, ribs, or sternum. CASE REPORT - CASE DESCRIPTION: A 48-year-old Afro-Caribbean gentleman with a history of hypertension and obesity was admitted to the ICU with clinical, laboratory and radiographic features of COVID-19 infection despite persistently negative swabs. Whilst in ICU he required mechanical ventilation. His stay was further complicated by multiple infections, pulmonary emboli, and the presence of a cavitating lesion in the left lung. Cultures from bronchoalveolar lavage and a central venous catheter line grew Serratia Mascense, candida glabrata and pseudomonas were isolated from his urine. He was treated with multiple antibiotics including meropenem, tazocin, ceftazidime and avibactam. After 61 days in the ICU he was transferred to the ward. He developed severe pain in his right hip which was worse on movement. This was followed by urinary incontinence and sensory deficit in the right L2/L3 dermatome. He underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of his spine and sacroiliac joints which showed right sided sacroiliitis and oedema around the iliopsoas muscle. He was started on vancomycin, later changed to ceftazidime avibactam and metronidazole. An echocardiogram did not show any vegetations. He underwent a biopsy of his sacroiliac joints which confirmed the presence of leucocytes, extended cultures yielded candida albicans in one out of two biopsy specimens. Considering ongoing pyrexia, pain and inflammatory markers, intravenous fluconazole was added to his antibiotic regimen which resulted in a marked improvement in mobility. After four weeks, ceftazidime, metronidazole and avibactam were stopped, and fluconazole was administered as oral tablets. 6 days later he became febrile and IV fluconazole was restarted. A repeat chest CT showed resolution of the cavity but ongoing changes suggestive of organising pneumonia. A repeat MRI of the sacroiliac joints revealed minor improvement. Intravenous Fluconazole was continued for a total of 8 weeks and was changed to tablets for complete a total of 12 weeks. CASE REPORT - DISCUSSION: This is a severe case of COVID-19 infection who despite 9 negative PCR tests, on day 53, had positive IgG for SARS-CoV-2 infection, confirming our clinical suspicion. Particularly in the ICU setting, individuals are approximately ten times more likely to have secondary bacterial/fungal infections with more frequent detection of multidrug-resistant Gram- negative pathogens. This case highlights several difficulties. Urine cultures had confirmed candida albicans, likely to be related to catheter related urinary tract infections, and a possible source for our patient but also a resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa species. Furthermore, cultures were positive for Serratia Mascense, candida glabrata. He had also already been treated with prolonged, broad spectrum antimicrobial treatment. Considering this, establishing the aetiology of the septic sacroiliitis was challenging. The rarity of candida sacroiliitis and presence of the organism in just one specimen made this more difficult. This led to the decision of a repeat sacroiliac biopsy to supply sufficient samples for further microbial analyses such as 16S, 18S and mycobacteria culture, all of which were negative. He became febrile after the discontinuation of antimicrobials and a switch to oral fluconazole therapy. He was extensively re-investigated and despite resolution of the lung cavity, there were changes which could have been consistent with an organising pneumonia. At this point he was neutropenic, mildly eosinophilic, and therefore a drug reaction was also considered. Repeat MRI revealed resolving muscle inflammation and minimal change at the bone site, with erosions and possible reactive bone marrow oedema. Following discussion with microbiology the decision was made to persist with intravenous Fluconazole. He continued to improve, and his inflammatory markers normalised after 8 weeks of treatment. Prednisolone was started for COVID-19 related pneumonitis. Long-term antifungal treatment is advisable, and we aim to complete 12 weeks of treatment. Case report - Key learning points: 1. Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, particularly those requiring ICU admission were at risk of developing superinfections with multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria or fungal infections. 2. Candida albicans sacroiliitis is rare therefore early aspiration/biopsy is essential for the management. 3. Longer treatment is needed in osteoarticular candida infections, even up to 6 or 12 months, therefor long-term close monitoring of this patients is essential. 4. The utility and timing of reimaging patients following such infections is still unclear. 5. Close multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary team collaboration is essential in the management of this complex patients.","Onac, Ioana; Ali, Saadia; Mahto, Arti; Rutherford, Andrew; Galloway, James; Nagra, Deepak",Rheumatol Adv Pract,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7607306/,192

OBJECTIVE: The current document represents a recent update in the Indian context, regarding unit design, equipment, organization, staffing as well as admission and discharge criteria for different levels of Pediatric Intensive Care and teaching units with PICU training programs, as well as nonteaching units. PROCESS: The Pediatric Intensive Care College Council (PICC), an academic wing of the Indian Academy of Pediatrics (IAP) Intensive Care Chapter took the initiative to update the guidelines with members of the PICU guidelines Committee writing group. After a great deal of discussion at conferences and through mailing and feedback with listed members, as well as with the guidance and feedback of senior PICU guidelines advisory committee members, The consensus is now updated. These guidelines are intended to serve as a reference for health Care institutions wishing to establish a new PICU or to modify an existing PICU. As a resource, experience of those members who have worked extensively in western PICUs was also taken into consideration, in addition to published guidelines in the medical literature. PICUs with teaching programs run by the IAP Intensive Care Chapter must follow these criteria for unit accreditation and teaching curricula as applicable. RECOMMENDATIONS: Unit design, equipment, organization, staffing as well as admission and discharge criteria for different levels of pediatric intensive care are updated.","Khilnani, Praveen; Ramachandran, Bala; Shaikh, Farhan; Sharma, Rachna; Sachdev, Anil; Deopujari, S.; Bansal, Arun; Nakate, Dayanand; Ghorpade, Sanjay",Indian Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7678571/,192

To date, there have been no studies evaluating their epidemiology and impact in the ICU. Prior to planning a multicenter study, assessment of recruitment, feasibility, and pilot study procedures is needed. In this pilot study, we aimed to evaluate the feasibility of conducting a large multicenter prospective cohort study. METHODS: This feasibility study recruited adult patients admitted to the ICU with TBI and an abnormal cerebral CT scan. In all patients, we documented Richmond Agitation Sedation Score (RASS) and agitated behaviors every 8-h nursing shift using a dedicated tool documenting 14 behaviors. Our feasibility objectives were to obtain consent from at least 2 patients per month; completion of screening logs for agitated behaviors by bedside nurses for more than 90% of 8-h shifts; completion of data collection in an average of 6 h or less; and obtain 6-month follow-up for surviving patients. The main clinical outcome was the incidence of agitation and individual agitated behaviors. RESULTS: In total, 47 eligible patients were approached for inclusion and 30 (64% consent rate) were recruited over a 10-month period (3 patients/month). In total, 794 out of 827 (96%) possible 8-h periods of agitated behavior logs were completed by bedside nurses, with a median of 24 observations (IQR 28.0) per patient. During the ICU stay, 17 of 30 patients developed agitation (56.7%; 95% CI 0.37–0.75) defined as RASS ≥ 2 during at least one observation period and for a median of 4 days (IQR 5.5). At 6 months post-TBI, among the 24 available patients, an unfavorable score (GOS-E < 5 including death) was reported in 12 patients (50%). In the 14 patients who were alive and available at 6 months, the median QOLIBRI score was 74.5 (IQR 18.5). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the feasibility of conducting a larger cohort study to evaluate the epidemiology and impact of agitated behaviors in critically ill TBI patients. This study also shows that agitated behaviors are frequent and are associated with adverse events.

43569,"Productive integration, economic recession and employment in Europe: an assessment based on vertically integrated sectors",2020-12-24,"Staying informed about COVID-19 is crucial to maintaining public health. Although older adults are at increased risk of complications, recent data (Global Web Index, 2020) suggest that they are less likely to seek out information about COVID-19. This is consistent with prior evidence indicating that information seeking is negatively associated with age (Mata & Nunes, 2010). However, it remains unclear whether older adults merely fail to seek information or intentionally avoid information. In response, we examined whether age is associated with general information seeking and deliberate information avoidance in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on previous work indicating age-related shifts in motivational priorities (Carstensen, 2006) we also examined whether avoidance motives differ by age. In a pre-registered online study, an adult lifespan sample (N=500, Mage=49.90, 51% female, 67% non-Hispanic White) completed self-report measures of media consumption, information avoidance, and avoidance motives with respect to the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we measured behavioral information avoidance by allowing participants to opt out of receiving valid COVID-19 information. As predicted, age was associated with decreased media consumption (p<.001) and higher information avoidance about COVID-19 on the behavioral measure (p<.01). Self-reported information avoidance, in contrast, was highest among younger adults (p<.05). Further, with the exception of concerns about trustworthiness, older adults were less likely than younger adults to endorse various information avoidance motives (ps<.05). Thus, although information seeking is lower and behavioral information avoidance about COVID-19 is higher in later life, this cannot be traced to explicit intentions or select motives.","Deng, Stephanie; Nolte, Julia; Loeckenhoff, Corinna",Innov Aging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7742110/,192

43730,On the approximability of the fixed-tree balanced minimum evolution problem,2021-01-02,"Nanoparticles are promising tools for nanomedicine in a wide array of therapeutic and diagnostic applications. Yet, despite the advances in the biomedical applications of nanomaterials, relatively few nanomedicines made it to the clinics. The formation of the biomolecular corona on the surface of nanoparticles has been known as one of the challenges toward successful targeting of nanomedicines. This adsorbed protein layer can mask targeting moieties and creates a new biological identity that critically affects the subsequent biological interactions of nanomedicines with cells. Extensive studies have been directed toward understanding the characteristics of this layer of biomolecules and its implications for nanomedicine outcomes at cell and organism levels, yet several aspects are still poorly understood. One aspect that still requires further insights is how the biomolecular corona interacts with and is “read” by the cellular machinery. Within this context, this review is focused on the current understanding of the interactions of the biomolecular corona with cell receptors. First, we address the importance and the role of receptors in the uptake of nanoparticles. Second, we discuss the recent advances and techniques in characterizing and identifying biomolecular corona-receptor interactions. Additionally, we present how we can exploit the knowledge of corona-cell receptor interactions to discover novel receptors for targeting of nanocarriers. Finally, we conclude this review with an outlook on possible future perspectives in the field. A better understanding of the first interactions of nanomaterials with cells, and -in particular -the receptors interacting with the biomolecular corona and involved in nanoparticle uptake, will help for the successful design of nanomedicines for targeted delivery.","Aliyandi, Aldy; Zuhorn, Inge S.; Salvati, Anna",Front Bioeng Biotechnol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7758247/,192

So, there is a need to forecast the epidemic lifespan, which can help us in taking preventive measures and remedial action on time. These preventive measures and corrective action may consist of closing schools, closing malls, closing theaters, sealing of borders, suspension of public services, and suspension of traveling. Resuming such restrictions is depends upon the outbreak momentum and its decay rate. The accurate forecasting of the epidemic lifespan is one of the enormously essential and challenging tasks. It is a challenging task because the lack of knowledge about the novel virus-based diseases and its consequences with complicated societal-governmental factors can influence the widespread of this newly born disease. At this stage, any forecasting can play a vital role, and it will be reliable too. As we know, the novel virus-based diseases are in a growing phase, and we also do not have real-time data samples. Thus, the biggest challenge is to find out the machine learning-based best forecasting model, which could offer better forecasting with the limited training samples. In this paper, the Multi-Task Gaussian Process (MTGP) regression model with enhanced predictions of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak is proposed. The purpose of the proposed MTGP regression model is to predict the COVID-19 outbreak worldwide. It will help the countries in planning their preventive measures to reduce the overall impact of the speedy and widely spread infectious disease. The result of the proposed model has been compared with the other prediction model to find out its suitability and correctness. In subsequent analysis, the significance of IoT based devices in COVID-19 detection and prevention has been discussed.","Ketu, Shwet; Mishra, Pramod Kumar",Appl Intell,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7785924/,192

However, the literature does not provide a generic overview of the value network in tourism, including new market players, and their ways of interacting. Therefore, this paper develops a current overview of the value network of the European tourism ecosystem. By analyzing the business models and value streams of 704 European enterprises based on Crunchbase data, we identified 27 distinct roles and their respective interrelations in the domain. To validate the proposed value network, we conducted five expert interviews. Our results highlight the continuously growing importance of intermediaries in tourism. Furthermore, new technology players offer new opportunities for innovative services, creating high dynamism in the industry. Nonetheless, local entities, such as residents and communities, play a central role in European tourism and need to be included in experiences provided to tourists. Scholars and practitioners might use the results to identify disruptive actors and opportunities for innovation and niche creation.

DESIGN: Pilot studies of community models of care, training programs for health and social care professionals, public education programmes. SETTING: Selected hospitals, residential care homes for the elderly, and community centres in Hong Kong. PARTICIPANTS: Patients and their families at the end of life stage. MEASUREMENTS: Combination of quantitative and qualitative studies according to different components of the initiative. RESULTS: Effective training for professional staff occurred using training videos, role play, rather than lectures, and when concepts are integrated into daily practice and quality assurance programmes. Members of the public welcomed end of life care discussions and the implementation of advance care planning. The pilot community care program was found to reduce anxiety, depression, physical symptoms, improve communication within the family as well as promoting a feeling of peace among recipients of the service. It also reduced care giver strain and anxiety, as well as hospital visits and duration of stay. Similar findings were also observed among recipients of care in the residential care setting.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the epidemic features and related factors of hypertension and its awareness, treatment, and control rates among the northern Iranian population. METHODS: It was a community based cross-sectional study based on data from PERSIAN Guilan Cohort Study (PGCS). In total, 10,520 participants (aged 35–70 years) from the Guilan Province in northern Iran included in this study, between October 8, 2014, and January 20, 2017. Hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure ≥140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mmHg or a prior diagnosis of hypertension or being on antihypertensive medication. Potential correlates of hypertension and its awareness, treatment and control were analyzed by multivariate logistic regression adjusted for demographic factors, anthropometric characteristics, lifestyle variables, past medical history, and laboratory data. RESULTS: The prevalence of hypertension was 43.2% and the hypertension awareness, treatment, and control rate were 53.4%, 49.8%, and 73.7%, respectively. The multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that older age, urbanization, lower education, overweight and obesity, lower physical activity, prediabetes and diabetes, cardiovascular disease, psychiatric disorder, positive family history of hypertension and raised serum creatinine were independently associated with presence of hypertension. Awareness of hypertension was greater in the female sex, older age, rural residency, higher education and patient with comorbidities. Older age, rural residency and comorbidities were associated with treatment of hypertension. Control of hypertension was better among younger age, higher education, normal weight and higher physical activity. CONCLUSION: Hypertension is highly prevalent in the northern Iranian population. About half of affected persons are unaware of their disease and untreated. Modifying risk factors (such as weight lose and increase physical activity) and increasing hypertension awareness (by screening) is essential for primary and secondary prevention of high blood pressure in this population, especially in urban areas and among males, younger ages, and less educated.","Naghipour, Mohammadreza; Joukar, Farahnaz; Salari, Arsalan; Asgharnezhad, Mehrnaz; Hassanipour, Soheil; Mansour-Ghanaei, Fariborz",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7879995/,192

The influences of curing conditions and isobornyl acrylate (IBOA) content on PSA performance were comprehensively investigated by measurement of their rheological, thermal, and adhesive properties. In particular, rheological characterization was accomplished by several analytical methods, such as in situ UV rheology, frequency sweep, stress relaxation, and temperature ramp tests, to understand the effect of the UV curing process and IBOA content on the viscoelastic behavior of acrylic PSAs. The slow-cured samples were observed to form more tightly crosslinked networks compared to the fast-cured. On the other hand, at high loading levels of IBOA, in the case of slow curing, the sample exhibited a contrasting trend, having the shortest stress relaxation time and the highest energy dissipation; this was due to molecular chain scission occurring in the crosslinked polymer during UV polymerization. Consequently, we successfully demonstrated the influence of monomer composition of acrylic PSAs, and that of curing conditions employed in UV polymerization. This study provides valuable insights for the development of crosslinked polymer networks of acrylic PSAs for flexible display applications.

Some electrochemical tests such as cyclic voltammetry, differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), and impedance spectroscopy indicate the remarkable accuracy of this sensor and its operation in a relatively wide range of concentrations of rutin (100 nM-100 µM). The accuracy of the proposed electrochemical sensors is approximately 100 nM in 0.1 M PBS, (pH = 3) which is relatively impressive and can be reported.

Developing and emerging market economies have introduced major policy reforms and experienced significant economic growth. As a developing country, China has set an annual growth target, which has driven the nation’s economic policies for decades. Motivated by the Chinese experience, we develop an analytical framework to examine the case of economic growth targeting. In our model economy, key features for developing countries include the degree of commitment by the central bank, semi-dependence between the monetary authority and the fiscal authority, and the risk of sovereign default. From our analytical results, we find that under a GDP growth targeting regime, when the central bank is more committed to its growth target, the actual growth rate becomes close to the target level, the inflation rate increases moderately for those countries with flatter supply curves, and the social welfare improves. Moreover, higher growth rate is associated with lower tax levied by the fiscal authority, and it is inversely related to the government’s default probability. Policy implication could be drawn from our model results for developing countries when they evaluate the policy option of growth targeting, in order to achieve positive and sustainable economic growth.","Jiang, Yanqing; Dai, Yuwen",Globalization and Sustainable Growth in China,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7979180/,192

The modern conception of law and authority assumes that such a distinction is possible, and it indeed forms the basis of our understanding of how constitutionalism should operate under extreme conditions. State practice that blurs this distinction may pose a threat to constitutionalism, not only under extreme conditions, but also in regular times, since the utilization of emergency powers in normal times quashes the rights associated with it.

The definition of individual ESG factors is first introduced to highlight sustainability considerations in businesses and how these can be considered and support circularity in business operations. The chapter further develops the concept that ESG reporting serves as an enabling tool with which the business operations can drive circularity and remedy the existing limitations of the linear economy in practice. The rise in ESG reporting from companies, and the ESG considerations of companies based on their disclosures are discussed. Incorporation of ESG factors into business operations is also evidenced through real-world case studies. The impact of ESG performance and the growing awareness of sustainability among businesses, consumers, and investors on the current investing trends and its contribution to embracing circularity is presented as the conclusion of the chapter.","Patil, Rashmi Anoop; Ghisellini, Patrizia; Ramakrishna, Seeram",An Introduction to Circular Economy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7988270/,192

50285,The Alternative: The Pragmatic and Moral Advantages of Globalized Socialist Cooperation,2020-09-12,"Missing genotypes can affect the efficacy of machine learning approaches to identify the risk genetic variants of common diseases and traits. The problem occurs when genotypic data are collected from different experiments with different DNA microarrays, each being characterised by its pattern of uncalled (missing) genotypes. This can prevent the machine learning classifier from assigning the classes correctly. To tackle this issue, we used well-developed notions of object-attribute biclusters and formal concepts that correspond to dense subrelations in the binary relation [Formula: see text] . The paper contains experimental results on applying a biclustering algorithm to a large real-world dataset collected for studying the genetic bases of ischemic stroke. The algorithm could identify large dense biclusters in the genotypic matrix for further processing, which in return significantly improved the quality of machine learning classifiers. The proposed algorithm was also able to generate biclusters for the whole dataset without size constraints in comparison to the In-Close4 algorithm for generation of formal concepts.","Ignatov, Dmitry I.; Khvorykh, Gennady V.; Khrunin, Andrey V.; Nikolić, Stefan; Shaban, Makhmud; Petrova, Elizaveta A.; Koltsova, Evgeniya A.; Takelait, Fouzi; Egurnov, Dmitrii","Recent Trends in Analysis of Images, Social Networks and Texts",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7988422/,192

One of the effects of forces of globalisation is that educational organisations, having modelled its goals and strategies on the entrepreneurial business and neo-liberal model, are compelled to embrace the corporate ethos of the efficiency, accountability and profit-driven managerialism. Hence, the politics of education reforms in the twenty-first century reflect this new emerging paradigm of standards-driven and outcomes-defined policy change (Zajda 2015, 2020a). Some policy analysts have criticized the ubiquitous and excessive nature of standardization in education imposed by the EFA framework (Carnoy 1999; Burbules and Torres 2000; Meyer and Benavot 2013; Zajda and Rust 2016a, b; Zajda 2020c).","Zajda, Joseph; Rust, Val",Globalisation and Comparative Education,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7989920/,192

50813,On the Health Benefits vs. Risks of Seaweeds and Their Constituents: The Curious Case of the Polymer Paradigm,2021-03-19,"Keyed and unkeyed cryptographic permutations often iterate simple round functions. Substitution-permutation networks (SPNs) are an approach that is popular since the mid 1990s. One of the new directions in the design of these round functions is to reduce the substitution (S-Box) layer from a full one to a partial one, uniformly distributed over all the rounds. LowMC and Zorro are examples of this approach. A relevant freedom in the design space is to allow for a highly non-uniform distribution of S-Boxes. However, choosing rounds that are so different from each other is very rarely done, as it makes security analysis and implementation much harder. We develop the design strategy Hades and an analysis framework for it, which despite this increased complexity allows for security arguments against many classes of attacks, similar to earlier simpler SPNs. The framework builds upon the wide trail design strategy, and it additionally allows for security arguments against algebraic attacks, which are much more of a concern when algebraically simple S-Boxes are used. Subsequently, this is put into practice by concrete instances and benchmarks for a use case that generally benefits from a smaller number of S-Boxes and showcases the diversity of design options we support: A candidate cipher natively working with objects in [Formula: see text] , for securing data transfers with distributed databases using secure multiparty computation (MPC).

Methods: The Web of Science database was used to perform the publication search, looking for the terms “genetic*” AND “myopia” within the period between 2009 and October 2020. The CitNetExplorer and CiteSpace software were then used to conduct the publication analysis. To obtain the graphics, the VOSviewer software was used. Results: A total of 721 publications were found with 2999 citations generated within the network. The year 2019 was singled out as a “key year”, taking into account the number of publications that emerged in that year and given that in 2019, 200 loci associated with refractive errors and myopia were found, which is considered to be great progress. The most widely cited publication was “Genome-wide meta-analyses of multiancestry cohorts identify multiple new susceptibility loci for refractive error and myopia”, an article by Verhoeven et al., which was published in 2013. By using the clustering function, we were able to establish three groups that encompassed the different research areas within this field: heritability rate of myopia and its possible association with environmental factors, retinal syndromes associated with myopia and the genetic factors that control and influence axial growth of the eye. Conclusions: The citation network offers a comprehensive and objective analysis of the main papers that address genetic myopia.","Alvarez-Peregrina, Cristina; Martinez-Perez, Clara; Villa-Collar, Cesar; Sánchez-Tena, Miguel Ángel",Genes (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8003911/,192

The method first parses and reconstructs the data received by the system initially and then stores the reconstructed valid data into the local database, which realizes the fast data summarization under the heavy concurrency scenario. Secondly, a multiformat data adaptation method is designed for the problem that the data to be provided and processed are in various formats. The method uses a unified data format and adaptation process constraints to achieve centralized management of heterogeneous data from multiple sources, which provide a unified data support service for the system and upper-layer applications. Again, to deal with the application problem of highly correlated data, the data-sharing system provides data for each functional component of the telemedicine platform according to business requirements based on standardized data structure and unified storage management. This enables the barrier-free flow of multisource highly correlated data. When the consultation is in progress, the doctor can communicate with the patient with video and audio devices and, at the same time, can access the patient's historical medical records and the medical records uploaded by the patient; after the consultation is completed, the consultation doctor needs to fill in the consultation record. The consultation assistance module can statistically analyse the workload of doctors and other information according to the background data, and the telemedicine system will play an increasingly important role in the medical and health care business.","Li, Fang",J Healthc Eng,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8060097/,192

Majorities of such foods have harmful effects on human health due to higher percentages of saturated fatty acids, trans-fatty acids, and hydrogenated fats in the form of high lipid diet (HLD). Moreover, food manufacturers add monosodium glutamate (MSG) to enhance the taste and palatability of the HLD. Both MSG and HLD induce the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and thereby alter the redox-homeostasis to cause systemic damage. However, MSG mixed HLD (MH) consumption leads to dyslipidemia, silently develops non-alcoholic fatty liver disease followed by metabolic alterations and systemic anomalies, even malignancies, via modulating different signaling pathways. This comprehensive review formulates health care strategies to create global awareness about the harmful impact of MH on the human body and recommends the daily consumption of more natural foods rich in antioxidants instead of toxic ingredients to counterbalance the MH-induced systemic anomalies.","Banerjee, Arnab; Mukherjee, Sandip; Maji, Bithin Kumar",Toxicol Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8120859/,192
53539,Antimicrobial Polymeric Structures Assembled on Surfaces,2021-05-12,"FUNDING ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS: Type of funding sources: Other. Main funding source(s): Special Research Fund (BOF), Hasselt University INTRODUCTION: The transportation sector is one of the major sectors influencing climate change, contributing around 16% of total Greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions. Aviation contributes to 12% of the transport related emissions. Among other climate change impacts, elevated heat exposure is associated with increased cardiac events and exposure to air pollution caused by GHG emissions has also well-known association with increased cardiovascular related morbidity and mortality. The global temperature rise should be restricted to less than 2 °C which requires keeping carbon emission (CO2) less than 2900 billion tonnes by the end of the 21st century. Assuming air travel a major contributing source to GHG, this study aims to raise the awareness about potential carbon emissions reduction due to air travel of international events like a scientific conference. PURPOSE: Due to the global pandemic of COVID-19, the Preventive cardiology conference 2020 which was planned to be held at Malaga Spain, instead was held in virtual online way. This study aims to calculate the contribution of reduced CO2 emissions in tons due to ESC preventive cardiology conference 2020, which was then held online and air travel of the registered participants was avoided. METHODS: Anonymized participant registration information was used to determine the country and city of the 949 registered participants of the Preventive Cardiology conference 2020. It is assumed that participants would have travelled from the closest airports from their reported city locations to Malaga airport, Spain. At first, the closest city airports were determined using Google maps and flights information, then the flight emissions (direct and indirect CO2-equivalent emissions) per passenger for the given flight distances were calculated. The CO2 emissions (tons) were calculated for round trips in economy class from the participants of 68 nationalities (excluding 60 participants from Spain as they are assumed to take other modes of transport than airplane). RESULTS: In total, 1156.51 tons of CO2 emissions were saved by turning the physical conference into a virtual event. This emission amount is equivalent to the annual CO2 production of 108 people living in high-income countries. CONCLUSION: The pandemic situation has forced us to rethink the necessity of trips by air and has shown us the feasibility of digitally organized events. The information from this study can add to the awareness about reduced amount of carbon emission due to air travel by organizing events in a virtual way when possible. Apart from only digitally organized events there are others options to reduce the carbon footprint of conferences such as limiting the number of physical attendees, encouraging the use of relatively sustainable transport modes for participants from nearby countries (e.g. international trains and use of active transport modes at conference venue etc.) and including CO2 emission offsetting costs.","Batool, T; Neven, A; Vanrompay, Y; Adnan, M; Dendale, P",Eur J Prev Cardiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8136099/,192

Rather, they are governed by “hybrid institutional complexes” (HICs) comprising heterogeneous interstate, infra-state, public–private and private transnational institutions, formal and informal. We develop the concept of the HIC as a novel descriptive and analytical lens for the study of contemporary global governance. The core structural difference between HICs and regime complexes is the greater diversity of institutional forms within HICs. Because of that diversity, HICs operate differently than regime complexes in two significant ways: (1) HICs exhibit relatively greater functional differentiation among their component institutions, and hence suffer from relatively fewer overlapping claims to authority; and (2) HICs exhibit greater informal hierarchy among their component institutions, and hence benefit from greater ordering. Both are systemic features. HICs have characteristic governance benefits: they offer good “substantive fit” for multi-faceted governance problems and good “political fit” for the preferences of diverse constituents; constrain conflictive cross-institutional strategies; and are conducive to mechanisms of coordination, which enhance substantive coherence. Yet HICs also pose characteristic governance risks: individual institutions may take on aspects of problems for which they are ill-suited; multiple institutions may create confusion; HICs can amplify conflict and contestation rather than constraining them; and the “soft” institutions within HICs can reduce the focality of incumbent treaties and intergovernmental organizations and forestall the establishment of new ones. We outline a continuing research agenda for exploring the structures, operations and governance implications of HICs.","Abbott, Kenneth W.; Faude, Benjamin",Rev Int Organ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8149577/,192

However, many older adults have not engaged in exercise due to social distancing measures implemented to combat the Covid-19 pandemic. The present study aims to administer a remote physical exercise training program to older adults in Canada and examine its effects on EF and mood, beginning with the collection of the following baseline data. METHODS: So far, nine older adults (78% females, 66–78 years-old) have completed a remote assessment that examines current physical exercise engagement, Covid-related distress, general mood, and executive behavior. In addition, the assessment included computerized tasks measuring various aspects of EF. Pattern analyses were used to characterize trends in baseline data. RESULTS: 67% of participants reported undergoing no moderate-vigorous physical exercise in a typical week. Compared to other participants, more individuals in this subgroup performed at a lower rate on a higher-order EF task (i.e., the Balloon Analogue Risk Task). Similarly, more participants who endorsed higher Covid-related psychological distress performed worse in the same task compared to others (40% in the lower third of performance vs. 0%), and also endorsed more difficulties with organization. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that those who do not engage in physical exercise are potential candidates to experience the mental health and cognitive benefits of a physical exercise training program.","FT, Agate; K, Milligan; A, Webber; MA, Garcia-Barrera",Arch Clin Neuropsychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8194549/,192

At Brighton & Sussex University Hospitals, intravenous MAbs, infliximab and vedolizumab, are administered in an outpatient setting. Licensing specifies post-infusion observation times of 1 to 2 hours. This affects waiting lists and capacity, particularly pertinent during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A single-centre observation study was conducted. Part 1 Retrospective data was collected for all infliximab and vedolizumab infusions from April to July 2019. Patients seen twice, were included once. For established infusion patients, historical reactions were recorded. Reaction incidence was established by observations, patient questioning and patient record review. To standardise the reactions, we used the cancer Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events; grade 3 is ‘severe’. Part 2 Observation time was removed from infusion 4 in April 2020. Prospective data was collected for all infliximab and vedolizumab infusions from April to December 2020. Multiple attendances were included. RESULTS: Part 1 130 infliximab patients (2607 infusions) and 69 vedolizumab patients (557 infusions) were reviewed. No severe reactions were recorded. All reactions occurred during induction dosing period. Analysis showed high levels of ‘no reactions observed’ after the first 4 infliximab infusions 97.7% (+1.6%, -4.7%), and the first 3 vedolizumab infusions 96.9% (+2.3%, -8.8%). 121 hours could be saved for infliximab and 64 hours for vedolizumab. Extrapolated this equates to 740 hours per year. Part 2 679 infliximab infusions were administered (including 12 new starters). 418 vedolizumab infusions were administered (16 new starters). No reactions were reported. Table key: Pt – patients, Inf – infusions, MAb – monoclonal antibody, Induct – Induction, Maint – maintenance, IV – intravenous, PO – oral, NC – not collected CONCLUSION: All MAb infusion reactions occurred within 3 infusions, were non-severe and managed in clinic.

This effect is most noteworthy on the medical students as clinical orientation and hands-on training are crucial toward development of basic medical skills. Various modifications to the methods of online teaching have been adopted in response to this pandemic to maintain continuity of medical education; however, we do not yet know the implications of this change. MATERIAL AND METHODS: To study the impact of this pandemic on medical students and to have a first-hand estimate of the adversities and challenges faced by them, an online questionnaire-based survey was conducted, administered through Google Forms maintaining anonymity. They were asked a series of multiple choice questions pertaining to the effects of this pandemic on their curriculum and academic activities. The responses received were analyzed by univariate analysis. RESULTS: Almost half (46.4%) of students reported a decreased interest in medicine after suspension of hands on teaching/practical classes. A total of 136 respondents (69.38%) felt that they became less productive in studies during the pandemic. Approximately 74% respondents felt less motivated to study at home. More than two-thirds of the respondents felt that on graduation, their clinical skills will be inferior to the students who graduated during the “non-COVID” era. About 84.69% of students believed that their examinations should be postponed hoping to get appropriate clinical experience once things normalize. CONCLUSION: Majority of the students feel less motivated and less productive, amidst the transition. The major area that has been compromised is the clinical skills training, a crucial adjunct to theoretical teaching in medical schools, and almost all students believe that their clinical skills in the long term would remain inferior to those who graduated before this pandemic.","Syal, Arshi; Arya, Yajur; Gupta, Monica",Indian J Med Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8219015/,192

In a series of five experiments, we investigated this ability using a Rapid Instructed Task Learning paradigm (RITL) comprising short miniblocks, each involving two novel stimulus-response rules. Each miniblock included (a) instructions for the novel stimulus-response rules, (b) a NEXT phase involving a constant (familiar) intervening task (0–5 trials), (c) execution of the newly instructed rules (2 trials). The results show that including a NEXT phase (and hence, a prospective memory demand) led to relatively more robust abstract learning as indicated by increasingly faster responses with experiment progress. Multilevel modeling suggests that the prospective memory demand was just another aspect of the abstract task structure which has been learned.","Pereg, Maayan; Harpaz, Danielle; Sabah, Katrina; Ben-Shachar, Mattan S.; Amir, Inbar; Dreisbach, Gesine; Meiran, Nachshon",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8269791/,192
56380,Quelques informations,2021-08-02,"To address the need for conceptual and clinical consensus within the field, psychotherapy research has increasingly focused on identifying common principles of change. While the field contends that this approach is atheoretical, we argue that principles of change cannot be fully understood or applied without the context of some theoretical framework. This article develops such a framework by identifying and explicating two theoretical assumptions that are implicitly shared by multiple therapeutic approaches: (1) that increasing agency is a fundamental aim of psychotherapy, and (2) that therapists enhance clients' agency by increasing their awareness. Building on the largely disparate empirical literatures demonstrating the importance of client agency and awareness to successful therapeutic outcomes, we provide a theoretical account of the highly iterative and synergistic meta-process by which these two factors jointly produce change. Explicit identification and empirical investigation of this Agency via Awareness psychotherapy meta-process, we argue, could facilitate scientific and clinical progress within the field. The hypothesized meta-process is discussed in relation to existing integrative models of therapeutic change, and its manifestations in the theory and practice of major therapeutic orientations are reviewed and illustrated. We discuss how this framework can facilitate psychotherapy research by providing a common language and conceptual foundation for wide-ranging therapeutic approaches, constructs, and findings. Finally, by raising clinicians' awareness of the implicit assumptions underlying their therapeutic work, we suggest that the Agency via Awareness framework can increase their agency over when and how they apply these assumptions in therapy to maximize client improvement.","Gorlin, Eugenia I.; Békés, Vera",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8316855/,192

However, the two viruses exhibit significantly different genetic diversity. The comparison of intrahost dynamics of HPgV-2 and HCV that mainly reflect virus-host interactions is needed to elucidate their intrahost difference of genetic diversity and the possible mechanisms. METHODS: Intrahost single nucleotide variations (iSNVs) were identified by means of next-generation sequencing from both cross-sectional and longitudinal samples from HPgV-2- and HCV-coinfected patients. The levels of human cytokines were quantified in the patient before and after HCV elimination by the treatment of direct-acting antivirals (DAA). RESULTS: Unlike HCV, the viral sequences of HPgV-2 are highly conserved among HPgV-2-infected patients. However, iSNV analysis confirmed the intrahost variation or quasispecies of HPgV-2. Almost all iSNVs of HPgV-2 did not accumulate or transmit within host over time, which may explain the highly conserved HPgV-2 consensus sequence. Intrahost variation of HPgV-2 mainly causes nucleotide transition in particular at the 3rd codon position and synonymous substitutions, indicating purifying or negative selection posed by host immune system. Cytokine data further indicate that HPgV-2 infection alone may not efficiently stimulate innate immune responses since proinflammatory cytokine expression dramatically decreased with elimination of HCV. CONCLUSION: This study provided new insights into the intrahost genomic variations and evolutionary dynamics of HPgV-2 as well as the impact of host immune selection and virus polymerase on virus evolution. The different genetic diversity of HPgV-2 and HCV makes HPgV-2 a potential new model to investigate RNA virus diversity and the mechanism of viral polymerase in modulating virus replication.","Liang, Yuanhao; Hu, Fengyu; Fan, Hang; Li, Linghua; Wan, Zhengwei; Wang, Haiying; Shui, Jingwei; Zhou, Yuanping; Tong, Yigang; Cai, Weiping; Tang, Shixing",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8403064/,192

57384,Editorial: New Mind-Body Interventions That Balance Human Psychoneuroimmunology,2021-08-20,"Open Educational Resources (OER) are an integral part of the debate about the digitization of education. This article reviews the state of international empirical research on OER to identify possible desiderata for a future research agenda. A systematic mapping approach is used to map the empirical English-speaking research landscape. The results reveal that research concentrates on the higher education sector while only a few studies are available for the school sector. In terms of research methodology, quantitative studies are prevalent, mostly using surveys. The research interest of the studies lies in the perception of OER and their adoption and usage in educational practices. Open Textbooks and their comparative cost advantages or qualitative comparability with traditional educational material is a newly emerging field. Research gaps exist regarding usability and user-friendliness of OER repositories. Addressing these gaps could support the numerous initiatives of the German federal states to establish OER portals. Further research gaps were identified regarding the effects of the use of OER on pedagogical approaches and established educational practices.","Otto, Daniel; Schröder, Nadine; Diekmann, Daniel; Sander, Pia",Z Erziehwiss,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8406650/,192

59285,Economic Criticism,2021-09-07,"Professor Harald zur Hausen, “father of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination” turned 85 years old this year. To mark the occasion, a retrospective look at the introduction of HPV vaccination 14 years ago is presented, highlighting the resistance that accompanied the early years of this beneficial vaccination. Even from an early stage vaccination for girls was included in the standard vaccination program of the Standing Commission on Vaccination (STIKO) in 2007 but it was not until 11 years later that it was recommended for boys as well. At around 50%, vaccination rates in both groups in Germany remain too low compared with other countries with school vaccination programs. Yet there are no longer any scientific doubts about HPV vaccination, which has been shown to be safe and effective in studies worldwide. Not only the reduction of precancerous lesions but also of cervical cancers could be shown in real-life studies in addition to the strong reduction of cases of condylomata acuminata in the vaccinated individuals, which is why the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the elimination of cervical cancer by building population immunity as a vaccination goal. To this end, further efforts should be made to increase vaccination rates in Germany, which was also included in a corresponding appeal at the Conference of Health Ministers in June 2021.","Wojcinski, Michael",Gynakologe,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8512599/,192

Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study from December 18th 2015 to March 18th 2016 in three public hospitals in Douala. Three hundred and sixty participants were studied prospectively for associated factors using a multivariate logistic regression model and 4732 files were studied retrospectively for the prevalence of infertility. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Results The prevalence of couple infertility was 19.2%. In logistic models, the factors which independently increased the risk of couple infertility were a history of reproductive tract infection/STI, a history of uterine fibroids, a history of dysmenorrhea and abortion for the females while for males it was a history of mumps, erectile dysfunction and exposure to chemicals/toxic substances/pesticides. Conclusion One in every five couples in this study was infertile. Several factors affect the risks associated with couple infertility. The identification of these factors could help detect subgroups of couples at high risk of infertility. Reproductive health education, screening programmes for STI's that may lead to infertility should be offered to couples.","Egbe, Thomas Obinchemti; Mbaki, Charmaine Ngo; Tendongfor, Nicholas; Temfack, Elvis; Belley-Priso, Eugene",African health sciences,https://doi.org/10.4314/ahs.v20i4.57; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34394265/,192

We examined the relationship between Italian news media coverage of COVID-19 and compliance with stay-at-home orders, which could impact the spread of epidemics. We used a computational method for framing analysis (ANTMN) and combined it with Google's Community Mobility data. A time-series analysis using vector autoregressive models showed that the Italian media used media frames that were largely congruent with ones used by journalists in other countries: A scientific frame focusing on symptoms and health effects, a containment frame focusing on attempts to ameliorate risks, and a social frame, focusing on political and social impact. The prominence of different media frames over time was associated with changes in Italians' mobility patterns. Specifically, we found that the social frame was associated with increased mobility, whereas the containment frame was associated with decreased mobility. The results demonstrate that the ways the news media discuss epidemics can influence changes in community mobility, above and beyond the effect of the number of deaths per day.","Ophir, Yotam; Walter, Dror; Arnon, Daniel; Lokmanoglu, Ayse; Tizzoni, Michele; Carota, Joëlle; DAntiga, Lorenzo; Nicastro, Emanuele",Journal of health communication,https://doi.org/10.1080/10810730.2021.1899344; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33787462/,192

A systematic literature review of healthcare consumer attitudes towards the secondary use and sharing of health administrative and clinical trial data was conducted. EMBASE/MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, PubMed, CINAHL, Informit Health Collection, PROSPERO Database of Systematic Reviews, PsycINFO, and ProQuest databases were searched. Eligible articles included those reporting qualitative or quantitative original research and published in English. No restrictions were placed on publication dates, study design or disease setting. One author screened articles for eligibility, and two authors were involved in the full text review process. Data was extracted using a pre-piloted data extraction template by one author and checked by another. Conflicts were resolved by consensus. Quality and bias were assessed using the QualSyst criteria for qualitative and quantitative studies. This paper focuses on a subset of 35 articles identified from the wider search which focus on issues of privacy, trust, and transparency. Studies included a total of 56,365 respondents. Results of this systematic literature review indicate that while respondents identified advantages in sharing health data, concerns relating to trust, transparency, and privacy remain. Organisations collecting health data and those who seek to share data or undertake secondary data analysis should continue to develop trust, transparency, and privacy with healthcare consumers through open dialogue and education. Consideration should be given to these issues at all stages of data collection including the conception, design, and implementation phases. While individuals understand the benefits of health data sharing for research purposes, ensuring a balance between public benefit and individual privacy is essential. Researchers and those undertaking secondary data analysis need to be cognisant of these key issues at all stages of their research.

Survival in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is relatively low, generally between five per cent and 10%. Being able to explore new methods to improve the relatively low survival rate is vital for people with these conditions. Passive leg raise (PLR) during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) has been found to improve cardiac preload and blood flow during chest compressions. The aim of our study is to evaluate whether early PLR during CPR also has an impact on one-month survival in sudden and unexpected out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). METHOD/DESIGN A prospective, randomized, controlled trial in which all patients (≥18 years) receiving out-of hospital CPR are randomized by envelope to be treated with either PLR or in the flat position. The ambulance crew use a special folding stool which allows the legs to be elevated about 20 degrees. Primary end-point: survival to one month. Secondary end-point: survival to hospital admission to one month and to one year with acceptable cerebral performance classification (CPC) 1-2. DISCUSSION PLR is a simple and fast maneuver. We believe that the greatest benefit with PLR is when performed early in the process, during the first minutes of CPR and before the first defibrillation. To reach power this study need 3000 patients, we hope that this method article will encourage other sites to contact us and take part in our study.

63935,"Update to Our Reader, Reviewer, and Author Communities-April 2020.",2020-04-23,"Investigations of real-time brain activations during walking have become increasingly important to aid in recovery of walking after a stroke. Individual brain activation patterns can be a valuable biomarker of neuroplasticity during the rehabilitation process and can result in improved personalized medicine for rehabilitation. The purpose of this systematic review is to explore the brain activation characteristics during walking post-stroke by determining: (1) if different components of gait (i.e., initiation/acceleration, steady-state, complex) result in different brain activations, (2) whether brain activations differ from healthy individuals. Six databases were searched resulting in 22 studies. Initiation/acceleration showed bilateral activation in frontal areas; steady-state and complex walking showed broad activations with the majority exploring and finding increases in frontal regions and some studies also showing increases in parietal activation. Asymmetrical activations were often related to performance asymmetry and were more common in studies with slower gait speed. Hyperactivations and asymmetrical activations commonly decreased with walking interventions and as walking performance improved. Hyperactivations often persisted in individuals who had experienced severe strokes. Only a third of the studies included comparisons to a healthy group: individuals post-stroke employed greater brain activation compared to young adults, while comparisons to older adults were less clear and limited. Current literature suggests some indicators of walking recovery however future studies investigating more brain regions and comparisons with healthy age-matched adults are needed to further understand the effect of stroke on walking-related brain activation.","Lim, Shannon B; Louie, Dennis R; Peters, Sue; Liu-Ambrose, Teresa; Boyd, Lara A; Eng, Janice J",Journal of neuroengineering and rehabilitation,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12984-020-00797-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33451346/,192
64235,Technical characteristics can make the difference in a surgical linear stapler. Or not?,2015,"BACKGROUND The purpose of this study was to evaluate the associations between patient characteristics or surgical site classifications and the histologic remodeling scores of synthetic meshes biopsied from their abdominal wall repair sites in the first attempt to generate a multivariable risk prediction model of non-constructive remodeling. METHODS Biopsies of the synthetic meshes were obtained from the abdominal wall repair sites of 51 patients during a subsequent abdominal re-exploration. Biopsies were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and evaluated according to a semi-quantitative scoring system for remodeling characteristics (cell infiltration, cell types, extracellular matrix deposition, inflammation, fibrous encapsulation, and neovascularization) and a mean composite score (CR). Biopsies were also stained with Sirius Red and Fast Green, and analyzed to determine the collagen I:III ratio. Based on univariate analyses between subject clinical characteristics or surgical site classification and the histologic remodeling scores, cohort variables were selected for multivariable regression models using a threshold p value of ≤0.200. RESULTS The model selection process for the extracellular matrix score yielded two variables: subject age at time of mesh implantation, and mesh classification (c-statistic = 0.842). For CR score, the model selection process yielded two variables: subject age at time of mesh implantation and mesh classification (r (2) = 0.464). The model selection process for the collagen III area yielded a model with two variables: subject body mass index at time of mesh explantation and pack-year history (r (2) = 0.244). CONCLUSION Host characteristics and surgical site assessments may predict degree of remodeling for synthetic meshes used to reinforce abdominal wall repair sites. These preliminary results constitute the first steps in generating a risk prediction model that predicts the patients and clinical circumstances for which non-constructive remodeling of an abdominal wall repair site with synthetic mesh reinforcement is most likely to occur.","Cavallo, Jaime A; Roma, Andres A; Jasielec, Mateusz S; Ousley, Jenny; Creamer, Jennifer; Pichert, Matthew D; Baalman, Sara; Frisella, Margaret M; Matthews, Brent D; Deeken, Corey R",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-013-3405-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24442681/,192

In a population of rhesus macaques maintained at the Wisconsin National Primate Research Center, moderate CR lowered the incidence of aging-related deaths. At the time point reported, 50% of control fed animals survived as compared with 80% of the CR animals. Furthermore, CR delayed the onset of age-associated pathologies.

Whether non-drug interventions can be alternative therapies for COVID-19 patients with anxiety, depression and sleep disorders is controversial. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis and systematic review to evaluate the effects of non-drug interventions on anxiety, depression and sleep in patients with COVID-19 to provide guidance for clinical application. MATERIALS AND METHODS We searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from December 2019 to July 2020: China Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Chongqing VIP Chinese Science and Technology Periodical Database (VIP), Wanfang, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, PubMed, MEDLINE and Embase. Two investigators independently screened the literature according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, extracted data and evaluated the risk of bias in the included studies. Meta-analysis was performed using RevMan5.3 software. RESULTS A total of 5 articles with 768 subjects were included. Meta-analysis results indicated that non-drug interventions can reduce anxiety [SMD=-1.40, 95% CI (-1.62, -1.17), p<0.00001] and depression [SMD=-1.22, 95% CI (-2.01, -0.43), p=0.002] scores in patients with COVID-19. Descriptive analysis indicated that non-drug interventions can improve the sleep status of COVID-19 patients. Sensitivity analysis indicated that the meta-analysis results were stable. Egger's test and Begg's test showed no publication bias. CONCLUSIONS This meta-analysis found that non-drug interventions can reduce the anxiety and depression scores of patients with COVID-19. Due to the limitations of this study, more high-quality studies are needed to verify the findings, especially the effect of non-drug interventions on improving the sleep status of COVID-19 patients.","Ding, H; He, F; Lu, Y-G; Hao, S-W; Fan, X-J",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202101_24679; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33577065/,192

An array of guidelines on the management of cancer during this pandemic have been published since the first reports of the outbreak. This narrative review brings all the relevant information from the guidelines together into one document, to support patient care. We present a detailed review of published guidelines, statements, comments from peer-reviewed journals, and nationally/internationally recognized professional bodies and societies' web pages (in English or with English translation available) between December 1, 2019 and May 27, 2020. Search terms included combinations of COVID, SARS-COV-2, guideline, gynecology, oncology, gynecological, cancer. Recommendations for surgical and oncological prioritization of gynecological cancers are discussed and summarized. The role of minimally invasive surgery, patient perspectives, medico-legal aspects, and clinical trials during the pandemic are also discussed. The consensus is that elective benign surgery should cease and cancer surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy should continue based on prioritization. Patient and staff face-to-face interactions should be limited, and health resources used efficiently using prioritization strategies. This review and the guidelines on which it is based support the difficult decisions currently facing us in gynecological cancer.

The Sentinel-5 Precursor (S-5P) operational SO2 product is overestimated compared to the ground-based multiaxis differential optical absorption spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) measurements in China and shows an opposite variation to the surface measurements, which limits the application of TROPOspheric monitoring instrument (TROPOMI) products in emissions research. Radiometric calibration, a priori profiles, and fitting windows might cause the overestimation of S-5P operational SO2 product. Here, we improve the optimal-estimation-based algorithm through several calibration methods.

Yet, the notion of the ""digital divide"" presents significant inequities in terms of who accesses and benefits from the digital landscape. To better understand the social and structural inequities of the digital divide, a realist synthesis was conducted to inform theoretical understandings of information and communication technologies (ICTs); to understand the practicalities of access and use inequities; to uncover practices that facilitate digital literacy and participation; and to recommend policies to mitigate the digital divide. Research Design and Methods A systematic search yielded 55 articles published between 2006 and 2016. Synthesis of existing knowledge, combined with user-experience elicited through a deliberative dialogue session with community stakeholders (n = 35), made visible a pattern of privilege that determined individual agency in ICT access and use. Results Though age is consistently centralized as the key determinant of the digital divide, our analyses, which encompassed both van Dijk's resources and appropriation theory and intersectionality, appraised this notion and revealed that age is not the sole determinant. Findings highlight the role of other factors that contribute to digital inequity among community-dwelling middle-aged (45-64) and older (65+) adults, including education, income, gender, and generational status.

The COVID-19 emergency, its related global mobility restrictions and fear of hospitalization further highlighted the need of a comprehensive solution. OBJECTIVE We aimed to design and test a pragmatic e-Health system based on multiparametric telemonitoring to support of TIA/stroke patients in sub-acute phase during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS We proposed a telemonitoring system and protocol for TIA/minor stroke patients during COVID-19 pandemic for patients at risk of stroke recurrence. This system involves the use of portable devices for BP/HR/SpO2/temperature sensing, panic-button, gateway, and a dedicated ICT platform. The protocol is a 14-day multiparametric telemonitoring, therapy, and emergency intervention based on vital sign alteration notifications. We conducted a proof-of-concept validation test on 8 TIA/minor stroke patients in the early post-acute phase (< 14 days from ischemic event). RESULTS The proposed solution allowed to promptly and remotely identify vital sign alterations at home during the early post-acute phase, allowing therapy and behavioral intervention adjustments. Also, we observed a significant improvement of quality of life, as well as a significant reduction of anxiety and depression status.

67234,Editorial.,2021-06-01,"Consequences of COVID-19 pandemic responses have included exacerbated poverty, food insecurity and state and domestic violence. Such effects may be particularly pronounced amongst adolescents and young people living in contexts of precarity and constraint, including in South Africa. However, there are evidence gaps on the lived experiences of this group. We conducted telephonic semi-structured interviews with adolescents and young people in two South African provinces (n = 12, ages 18-25) in April 2020 to explore and document their experiences, challenges and coping strategies during strict COVID-19 lockdown. Participants described indirect effects of COVID-19 including food insecurity, lost livelihoods and changes to social service provisions such as municipal electricity services and sanitation. Psychosocial stressors related to uncertainty over education and work futures were also discussed. The aforementioned challenges were particularly present with young parents, 'working poor' participants, and those with pre-existing mental health challenges. Participants demonstrated excellent COVID-19 transmission and prevention knowledge, showing that they had received and correctly interpreted public health messaging. Despite this, many simultaneously held non-scientific COVID-19 beliefs. Engaging a socio ecological framework, findings demonstrate how the indirect effects of COVID-19 may exacerbate underlying multi-layered vulnerabilities for adolescents and young people living in contexts of precarity and constraint.","Gittings, Lesley; Toska, Elona; Medley, Sally; Cluver, Lucie; Logie, Carmen H; Ralayo, Nokubonga; Chen, Jenny; Mbithi-Dikgole, Jane",Global public health,https://doi.org/10.1080/17441692.2021.1899262; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33750269/,192

The main outcome measurements were complete response at 12 months, and adverse events.Of a total of 65 patients, 18 were treated with RFA and 47 with ESD. The procedure time of RFA was significantly shorter than that of ESD (126.6 vs 34.8 min; P < 0.001). The complete resection rate of ESD and complete response rate after primary RFA were 89.3% and 77.8%, respectively. Based on the histological evaluation of the post-ESD specimens showed 14 of 47 (29.8%) had histological upstaging compared with the pre-ESD biopsies, and 4 of them had lymphovascular invasion requiring chemoradiation or surgery. After additional therapy for residual lesions, 46 (97.9%) patients in the ESD group and 17 (94.4%) patients in the RFA group achieved a complete response at 12 months. Four patients (8.5%) developed major procedure-related adverse events in the ESD group, but none in the RFA group. In patients with lesions occupying more than 3/4 of the circumference, a significantly higher risk of esophageal stenosis was noted in the ESD group compared with RFA group (83% vs 27%, P = 0.01), which required more sessions of dilatation to resolve the symptoms (median, 13 vs 3, P = 0.04). There were no procedure-related mortality or neoplastic progression in either group; however, 1 patient who received ESD and 1 who received RFA developed local recurrence during a median follow-up period of 32.4 (range, 13-68) and 18.0 (range, 13-41) months, respectively.RFA and ESD are equally effective in the short-term treatment of early flat large ESCNs; however, more adverse events occur with ESD, especially in lesions extending more than 3/4 of the circumference. RFA does not allow for pathology to evaluate the curability after ablation, and thus currently the use for invasive ESCNs should be conservative until longer follow-up studies are available.","Wang, Wen-Lun; Chang, I-Wei; Chen, Chien-Chuan; Chang, Chi-Yang; Mo, Lein-Ray; Lin, Jaw-Town; Wang, Hsiu-Po; Lee, Ching-Tai",Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000002240; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26656367/,192

Zinc compounds have antiviral activities against various DNA and RNA viruses. Therefore, we investigated the effects of zinc compounds on the antiviral activity of interferon against HAV. MATERIALS AND METHODS The effects of zinc compounds with or without interferon on HAV genotype IIIA HA11-1299 replication were examined in human hepatoma Huh7 cells. Cell viability was examined by the MTS assay. Inflammasome associated gene expression was examined by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS Both zinc sulfate and zinc chloride had an inhibitory effect on HAV replication. Zinc sulfate tended to enhance while zinc chloride significantly enhanced the anti-HAV effect induced by interferon-alpha-2a. Zinc chloride significantly up-regulated mitogen-activated protein kinase 12 (MAPK12) and down-regulated 6 related genes [baculoviral IAP repeat containing 3 (BIRC3), interleukin 1 beta (IL1B), proline-serine-threonine phosphatase interacting protein 1 (PSTPIP1), prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2), PYD and CARD domain containing (PYCARD), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)].

However, despite a constant and wide-ranging editorial production and fruitful collaborations with colleagues and institutions at national and international level, the orthopaedic scientific community finds it difficult to recognize the EBM model as a solid reference: there are few guidelines available, there is little awareness of their usefulness, and the complexity of the methodology of production and adaptation of documents widens the gap between the orthopaedic real world and that of clinical epidemiology. After a quick analysis of the causes of this contrast, the authors reflect on the possible solutions to the problem, and propose to collaborate for a simplification of the guidelines production methodology, using innovative models of literature review, which have proved to be effective to make the best knowledge available quickly during the CoViD-19 pandemic.","Romanini, Emilio; Padua, Roberto; Tucci, Gabriele; Zanoli, Gustavo",Recenti progressi in medicina,https://doi.org/10.1701/3394.33756; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32573550/,192
68083,Surgery and the Smartphone: Can Technology Improve Equitable Access to Surgical Care?,2021-02-19,"OBJECTIVE To replace educational opportunities lost during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Department of Neurosurgery at Lenox Hill Hospital produced an open-access webinar series (""BRAINterns"") that covered a broad range of healthcare topics with a focus on neurosurgery. METHODS This eight-week webinar series ran from July 1st to August 28th, 2020. An optional exit survey was distributed to participants. Data were analyzed to characterize and better understand trends among a global cohort of participants. RESULTS A total of 16,484 people registered for BRAINterns and 6,675 took the survey (40.5% response rate). Responders represented 87 countries, of which the majority were from the United States of America and Canada (90.48%, n = 6,039). Responders were primarily female (82.9%, n = 5,521). Racial and ethnic representation was majority Asian (42%, n = 2,798), followed by White (22.7%, n = 1514), Hispanic/Latino (16.2%, n = 1,080), and Black and African Americans (7.7%, n = 516). Participants reported hearing about BRAINterns through various social media platforms, (72.18%, n = 4,818)-the most popular was TikTok (33.4%, n = 2,232). Overall, 93.4% of participants reported that the course was a good use of their time during the pandemic and 86.7% reported that the course helped replace lost opportunities. CONCLUSIONS These data demonstrate that webinar-based education is an effective method of expanding access to careers in medicine and in particular, neurosurgery, to traditionally underrepresented populations. Social media can be a powerful tool to combat barriers to early exposure and vastly improve diversity within the field.","D'Amico, Randy S; Immidisetti, Amanda; Katz, Joshua; White, Tim; Bedi, Anupama; Baum, Griffin; Ellis, Jason; Levine, Mitchell; Ortiz, Rafael; Boockvar, John A; Langer, David J",World neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wneu.2021.03.034; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33741545/,192

This study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of transrenal hemodialysis catheter insertion/replacement in patients with upper extremity central venous access failure. MATERIALS AND METHODS A multicenter retrospective cohort study was made of transrenal hemodialysis catheter insertion/replacement performed between 2014 and 2020. The history of renal replacement therapy and central venous catheters and the technical details of transrenal hemodialysis catheter insertion/replacement, patency, removal and complications were obtained for all patients. RESULTS Six insertion and four replacement procedures involving transrenal hemodialysis catheters were evaluated in six patients (M:F = 3:3; median age, 49.5 years). Percutaneous transrenal (right:left = 1:5) hemodialysis catheter insertion was technically successful without complication in all six patients. In two patients, the tract was not lost because the safety guidewire was still in place, so no second puncture was required. The mean procedure time was 33.0 ± 9.2 min. The mean primary patency duration was 107.3 ± 70.9 days. During the mean follow-up duration of 141.2 ± 137.1 days, four hemodialysis catheter replacement procedures were successfully performed for catheter malfunction (n = 2) and dislodgement (n = 2). Catheter removal was successfully performed in four patients after confirming normal coagulation, followed by subsequent renal replacement therapy. CONCLUSION Percutaneous insertion/replacement of transrenal hemodialysis catheters is feasible, safe, and effective when upper extremity central venous access is exhausted, and the catheters can be maintained for a reasonable period of time.

In the case of macromolecular protein complexes, which can have a large number of hydrogen bonds giving rise to extensive hydrogen-bond networks, efficient algorithms are required to analyze interactions that could be important for the dynamics and biological function of the complex. We present here a highly efficient, standalone interface designed for analyses of dynamical hydrogen-bond networks of biomolecules and macromolecular complexes. To facilitate a comprehensive description of protein dynamics, the interface includes analyses of hydrophobic interactions. We illustrate the usefulness and workflow of the interface by dissecting the dynamics of the ectodomain of SARS-CoV-2 protein S in its closed conformation. We find that protein S contains numerous local clusters of dynamic hydrogen bonds and identify hydrogen bonds that are sampled persistently. The receptor binding domain of the spike protein hosts only a handful of persistent hydrogen-bond clusters, suggesting structural plasticity.

Patient satisfaction and the safety of a novel GP-led patient triage system regarding suitability for colonoscopy are also evaluated. METHODS This is an observational study of all patients managed via a straight-to-test colorectal cancer pathway between 1st September 2019 and 19th March 2020. Comparison is made with all patients referred on the suspected colorectal cancer pathway prior to implementation of the straight-to-test pathway from 1st January 2019 to 30th July 2019. Patient satisfaction with the straight-to-test pathway was assessed with a telephone-based questionnaire. RESULTS Attainment of the 28-day diagnosis target for all suspected colorectal cancer referrals improved following the establishment of the straight-to-test pathway (88% vs 82%, p<0.0001). From a potential total of 548 outpatient colorectal clinic appointments for patients on the straight-to-test pathway, 504 (92%) were avoided. In those eligible for the straight-to-test pathway, GP assessment of patients suitable for colonoscopy agreed with that of the colorectal department in 93% of cases. Of the 50 patients who undertook the satisfaction survey, 86% were satisfied or very satisfied with the pathway. No patient suffered adverse events as a result of their straight-to-test investigations. CONCLUSION A straight-to-test pathway for suspected colorectal cancer referrals with novel GP-led patient triage safely streamlines patients through the suspected colorectal cancer diagnostic pathway and significantly reduces requirement for face-to-face outpatient clinic attendance. This is achieved with high patient satisfaction.","Sagar, Alex; Mai, Dinh Van Chi; Divya, G S; Al-Habsi, Ruqaiya; Wothers, Tracy; Ni Bhroin, Orna; Singh, Sandeep; O'Hara, Ichard; Keeler, Barrie D",Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland,https://doi.org/10.1111/codi.15410; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33075195/,192

This review describes recent findings of how pathogens do it. RECENT FINDINGS A common theme in interaction between pathogens and host cholesterol metabolism is pathogens targeting lipid rafts of the host plasma membrane. Many intracellular pathogens use rafts as an entry gate, taking advantage of the endocytic machinery and high abundance of outward-looking molecules that can be used as receptors. At the same time, disruption of the rafts' functional capacity, achieved by the pathogens through a number of various means, impairs the ability of the host to generate immune response, thus helping pathogen to thrive. Pathogens cannot synthesize cholesterol, and salvaging host cholesterol helps pathogens build advanced cholesterol-containing membranes and assembly platforms. Impact on cholesterol metabolism is not limited to the infected cells; proteins and microRNAs secreted by infected cells affect lipid metabolism systemically. SUMMARY Given an essential role that host cholesterol metabolism plays in pathogen development, targeting this interaction may be a viable strategy to fight infections, as well as metabolic complications of the infections.","Sviridov, Dmitri; Bukrinsky, Michael",Current opinion in lipidology,https://doi.org/10.1097/mol.0000000000000106; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25036592/,192

However, the role of upregulated DTYMK in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients still remains unclear. In this study, the DTYMK expression in HCC tumors was evaluated in three GEO series (GSE14520, GSE54236, GSE63898), TCGA-LIHC, and ICGC-IRLR-JP cohorts. Survival analysis of DTYMK based on TCGA-LIHC and ICGC-LIRI-JP cohorts was conducted. We found that DTYMK was dramatically upregulated in tumor tissue compared with that in adjacent liver tissue. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that high expression of DTYMK in HCC patients' tumor tissue was significantly corresponded to worse overall survival (OS) (P < 0.05). Further analysis showed that overexpressing DTYMK led to poor relapse free survival (RFS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) (all P < 0.05). In conclusion, DTYMK is upregulated in tumors and correlated with poor prognosis in HCC patients. In our report, DTYMK is higher expression in HCC cancer tissue and cell line than tumor adjacent tissue and normal liver cell line. Knocking down DTYMK can inhabit tumor cell proliferation by interfering cell cycle, whereas overexpression of DTYMK can promote tumor cell proliferation. These findings indicate that upregulation of DTYMK enhances tumor growth and proliferation by promoting cell cycle.","Zhou, Tianhao; Qin, Rui; Shi, Susu; Zhang, Hua; Niu, Chuanling; Ju, Gaoda; Miao, Sen",Cell cycle,https://doi.org/10.1080/15384101.2021.1958502; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34369850/,192

73292,[CD4+ T Lymphocytes: major players in antitumor immune response].,2021,"INTRODUCTION Stress and social isolation are potent predictors of negative health outcomes and are impacted in mood and anxiety disorders. Difficulties in social interactions have been particularly noted in people diagnosed with major depression disorder (MDD) and social phobia (SP). It remains poorly understood, however, how these variables interact on a moment-to-moment basis and which variables moderate this relationship. Psychological flexibility, or the ability to be open to experiences while maintaining engagement in valued activities, may help moderate the relationship between stress and social interaction. OBJECTIVE This study examined these variables in participants diagnosed with MDD and SP and compared them to a control group. METHODS Participants were diagnosed with a mental disorder (n = 118 MDD; n = 47 SP) or were in the control group consisting of participants without MDD or SP (n = 119). Using the event sampling methodology (ESM), participants were queried six times per day for 7 days about stress, social interactions, and emotional response (rigid vs. flexible). RESULTS Higher current stress levels were related to more social interactions. This relationship was even stronger in situations when response flexibility was increased, especially in the clinical groups. CONCLUSIONS Data suggest that a healthy psychological process (flexible emotional responding) buffers the relationship between stress and social interactions. We discuss how these variables interact and whether these patterns may paradoxically contribute to the maintenance of psychopathology.","Gloster, Andrew T; Hoyer, Jürgen; Karekla, Maria; Meyer, Andrea; Bader, Klaus; Imboden, Christian; Mikoteit, Thorsten; Hatzinger, Martin; Lieb, Roselind",Psychotherapy and psychosomatics,https://doi.org/10.1159/000511102; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33333528/,192

METHODS Women who were operated for CPFDs between January 2003 and June 2010 were retrospectively asked to answer the Pelvic Organ Prolapse/Urinary Incontinence Sexual Questionnaire-12, the Miller Score of Incontinence, and a urinary incontinence frequency score. We also questioned them about their sexual function and satisfaction before and after the operation using visual analogic scores. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE We compared the Pelvic Organ Prolapse/Urinary Incontinence Sexual Questionnaire-12 before and after the surgery in both groups, and we made an intragroup comparison. RESULTS There were 334 women identified, but only 51 could be included. Globally, we found no statistically significant differences in terms of sexual function before and after surgery between the 25 groups. Intragroup comparison demonstrated that, within the perineal approach group, patients experienced a decrease in their sexual arousal after the procedure. The choice of surgical route for pelvic floor disorders does not seem to have an impact on the results of postoperative sexual function in women. This study adds to the limited literature on sexual outcomes of surgery for CPFD. It is limited principally due to its retrospective design and the small number of patients included. CONCLUSION Both surgical routes have very similar outcomes on most sexual questions. A perineal approach combined with abdominal rectopexy did, however, demonstrate a slight decrease in sexual arousal of the patients after the intervention. Zawodnik A, Balaphas A, Buchs NC, et al.

74003,Nitrogen doping sludge-derived biochar to activate peroxymonosulfate for degradation of sulfamethoxazole: Modulation of degradation mechanism by calcination temperature.,2021-06-06,"BACKGROUND The COVID-19 is a public health issue all over the world. It is an unprecedented challenge for society. Frontline medical staff are at high risk of mental health problems due to the overwhelming workload, worry of infection, and inadequate protective instruments. The study is to investigate the psychological status of medical staff in a women and children's hospital in non-epicenter of COVID-19 during the early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS A total of 2,143 hospital medical staff participated in a cross-sectional online survey. Psychological response levels were assessed using the Psychological Questionnaire on Emergency Events in Public Health (PQEEPH), and mental health status was measured using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scale. RESULTS Eligible responses were received from 1,890 (90.6%) women and 197 (9.4%) men. In total, 10.3% of respondents rated the psychological impact of the outbreak as moderate or severe, and 4% reported severe anxiety symptoms. CONCLUSIONS Our findings indicated that the majority of the medical staff are in great level of mental health. The study demonstrates that females, the 31-40 age group, and those who have been widowed experienced greater levels of anxiety and therefore require more support. Furthermore, the cognition of medical workers might affect their emotional reactions. Measures to decrease anxiety during emergency outbreaks should therefore include communication strategies.","Zhang, Ling; Wang, Shiping; Shen, Jing; Wang, Ying; Huang, Xiuhua; Wu, Fang; Zheng, Xingli; Zeng, Ping; Qiu, Dan",Annals of palliative medicine,https://doi.org/10.21037/apm-20-2041; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33302673/,192

Two GAT readings were obtained by each optometrist in a randomised masked manner. Mean differences, and 95% limits of agreement (LoA) for each measurement were calculated. CCT was measured by CT-1P pachymeter.Results: Forty-one participants' IOPs were measured. Mean differences (95% LoA) between NCT, Pulsair, Icare compared to GAT for one optometrist were: 0.8 (-5.4 to 6.9) mmHg, -1.7 (-8.2 to 4.8) mmHg, -1.6 (-9.0 to 5.9) mmHg. Mean differences (95% LoA) in inter-optometrist agreement for GAT, NCT, Pulsair and Icare were: 0.3 (-6.7 to 7.3) mmHg, 0.4 (-2.1 to 2.9) mmHg, -0.9 (-3.6 to 1.9) mmHg and -0.2 (-4.9 to 4.5) mmHg, respectively. Mean differences (95% LoA) for intra-optometrist agreement for GAT were 0.2 (4.3 to -4.7) mmHg and 0.1 (3.6 to -3.9) mmHg for each optometrist, respectively. There was a weak positive association between CCT and both GAT (r2 = 0.11) and NCT (r2 = 0.12).Conclusion: Pulsair and Icare may measure IOP lower than GAT. Mean differences for inter-optometrist agreement for all tonometers were < 1 mmHg; Pulsair showed a statistically significant difference. Intra-optometrist agreement for GAT was good. IOP measurements taken by two community optometrists are comparable using tonometers used in community practice.","Campbell, Peter; Edgar, David F; Shah, Rakhee",Clinical & experimental optometry,https://doi.org/10.1080/08164622.2021.1878831; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33689641/,192
74323,224-Gbps single-photodiode PAM-4 transmission with extended transmitter bandwidth based on optical time-and-polarization interleaving.,2020-07-06,"BACKGROUND Preservation of esophageal and gastric function is a hallmark principle in ensuring optimal surgical outcomes after gastric fundoplication. In this study, we evaluated the impact of fundoplication on esophageal transit and gastric emptying using scintigraphy studies and related these functional findings to symptomatic outcomes. METHODS A total of 106 consecutive patients (37 women, 69 men) with both preoperative and 6-month postoperative nuclear scintigraphy studies undergoing partial (Toupet) fundoplication at a single institution were analyzed. Primary variables included alterations in esophageal transit and gastric emptying times after fundoplication (1 = rapid; 2 = normal; 3 = mild delay; 4 = severe delay). Symptomatic variables included heartburn, regurgitation, dysphagia, pulmonary symptoms, and bloating. RESULTS Mean age was 57.2 years. Symptomatic improvement was achieved in 91.5% of patients. Significant reduction of all symptoms (heartburn, regurgitation, pulmonary symptoms, and dysphagia) was noted after fundoplication, except gas bloating (4.7 vs. 20.8%). There were no significant differences in preoperative and postoperative esophageal transit (2.53 vs. 2.52) and gastric emptying (2.13 vs. 2.06) scores after fundoplication. Interestingly, 17% of esophageal transit times and 18% of gastric emptying times improved after fundoplication. However, worsening scores were seen in 16 and 12%, respectively. There was no significant postoperative dysphagia, even in patients with impaired transit times. CONCLUSIONS Nuclear scintigraphic assessment of esophageal transit and gastric emptying are valuable, user-friendly tools to identify and avoid functional motility problems in the setting of fundoplication. These studies seem to be a reasonable alternative to manometry in assessing esophageal function before surgery in this setting. Postoperative symptoms may be related to objective changes in esophageal transit or gastric emptying. The causes may be iatrogenic in nature or related to vagal denervation with associated changes in esophagogastric compliance. Awareness of these physiologic changes may prompt further technical precautions at the time of surgery to avoid vagal injury and also may facilitate postoperative medical management.","Schuchert, Matthew J; Pettiford, Brian L; Abbas, Ghulam; Oostdyk, Alicia; Landreneau, James R; Kilic, Arman; Landreneau, Joshua P; Luketich, James D; Landreneau, Rodney J",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-010-1099-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20490564/,192

74606,Quality of root canal fillings using three gutta-percha obturation techniques.,2016,"BACKGROUND End-inspiratory pause (EIP) prolongation decreases dead space-to-tidal volume ratio (Vd/Vt) and PaCO2. We do not know the physiological benefits of this approach to improve respiratory system mechanics in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients when mild hypercapnia is of no concern. METHODS The investigation was conducted in an intensive care unit of a university hospital, and 13 ARDS patients were included. The study was designed in three phases. First phase, baseline measurements were taken. Second phase, the EIP was prolonged until one of the following was achieved: (1) EIP of 0.7 s; (2) intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure ≥1 cmH2O; or (3) inspiratory-expiratory ratio 1:1. Third phase, the Vt was decreased (30 mL every 30 min) until PaCO2 equal to baseline was reached. FiO2, PEEP, airflow and respiratory rate were kept constant. RESULTS EIP was prolonged from 0.12 ± 0.04 to 0.7 s in all patients. This decreased the Vd/Vt and PaCO2 (0.70 ± 0.07 to 0.64 ± 0.08, p < 0.001 and 54 ± 9 to 50 ± 8 mmHg, p = 0.001, respectively). In the third phase, the decrease in Vt (from 6.3 ± 0.8 to 5.6 ± 0.8 mL/Kg PBW, p < 0.001) allowed to decrease plateau pressure and driving pressure (24 ± 3 to 22 ± 3 cmH2O, p < 0.001 and 13.4 ± 3.6 to 10.9 ± 3.1 cmH2O, p < 0.001, respectively) and increased respiratory system compliance from 29 ± 9 to 32 ± 11 mL/cmH2O (p = 0.001). PaO2 did not significantly change. CONCLUSIONS Prolonging EIP allowed a significant decrease in Vt without changes in PaCO2 in passively ventilated ARDS patients. This produced a significant decrease in plateau pressure and driving pressure and significantly increased respiratory system compliance, which suggests less overdistension and less dynamic strain.","Aguirre-Bermeo, Hernan; Morán, Indalecio; Bottiroli, Maurizio; Italiano, Stefano; Parrilla, Francisco José; Plazolles, Eugenia; Roche-Campo, Ferran; Mancebo, Jordi",Annals of intensive care,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13613-016-0183-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27558174/,192

Increasing the safety of these operations requires improving the instruments (endostaplers or endocutters) used for stapling and sectioning the tissues. METHODS We present a new prototype stapler for marketing in resection surgery, especially designed for the sleeve gastrectomy. RESULTS We suggest that the medical instrument industry creates devices in which the channel along which the knife blade runs is located asymmetrically. This would allow more staples to be placed on the side of the gastric remnant, thus improving the sealing and hemostasis of the suture line and reducing the number of complications for patients as a result.

Nevertheless, our knowledge and efficacy are quite limited in terms of measuring and evaluating all the variables and components that affect the management of medication adherence regimes as a complex phenomenon. The study aim is mapping the state-of-the-art of medication adherence measurement and assessment methods applied in chronic conditions. Specifically, we are interested in what methods and assessment procedures are currently used to tackle medication adherence. We explore whether Big Data techniques are adopted to improve decision-making procedures regarding patients' adherence, and the possible role of digital technologies in supporting interventions for improving patient adherence and avoiding waste or harm. METHODS A scoping literature review and bibliometric analysis were used. Arksey and O'Malley's framework was adopted to scope the review process, and a bibliometric analysis was applied to observe the evolution of the scientific literature and identify specific characteristics of the related knowledge domain. RESULTS A total of 533 articles were retrieved from the Scopus academic database and selected for the bibliometric analysis. Sixty-one studies were identified and included in the final analysis. The Morisky medication adherence scale (36%) was the most frequently adopted baseline measurement tool, and cardiovascular/hypertension disease, the most investigated illness (38%). Heterogeneous findings emerged from the types of study design and the statistical methodologies used to assess and compare the results.

Longer-term data are needed to determine whether the results are sustained. METHODS VBLOC DM2 is a prospective, observational study of 28 subjects with T2DM and body mass index (BMI) between 30 and 40 kg/m(2) to assess mid-term safety and weight loss and improvements in glycemic parameters, and other cardiovascular risk factors with VBLOC therapy. Continuous outcome variables are reported using mixed models. RESULTS At 24 months, the mean percentage of excess weight loss was 22% (95% CI, 15 to 28, p < 0.0001) or 7.0% total body weight loss (95% CI, 5.0 to 9.0, p < 0.0001). Hemoglobin A1c decreased by 0.6 percentage points (95% CI, 0.2 to 1.0, p = 0.0026) on average from 7.8% at baseline. Fasting plasma glucose declined by 15 mg/dL (95% CI, 0 to 29, p = 0.0564) on average from 151 mg/dL at baseline. Among subjects who were hypertensive at baseline, systolic blood pressure declined 10 mmHg (95% CI, 2 to 19, p = 0.02), diastolic blood pressure declined by 6 mmHg (95% CI, 0 to 12, p = 0.0423), and mean arterial pressure declined 7 mmHg (95% CI, 2 to 13, p = 0.014). Waist circumference was significantly reduced by 7 cm (95% CI, 4 to 10, p < 0.0001) from a baseline of 120 cm. The most common adverse events were mild or moderate heartburn, implant site pain, and constipation.

Here we show that a modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) vaccine expressing the MERS-CoV spike protein confers mucosal immunity in dromedary camels. Compared with results for control animals, we observed a significant reduction of excreted infectious virus and viral RNA transcripts in vaccinated animals upon MERS-CoV challenge. Protection correlated with the presence of serum neutralizing antibodies to MERS-CoV.

The aim of this study was to examine the timing of processes that occur before and after forearm muscles are activated during the RT task. METHODS Eleven LE (42 ± 11 yr) and 11 healthy controls (42 ± 11 yr) performed rapid wrist extension in response to an audio cue. Intramuscular EMG was obtained from extensor carpi radialis brevis (ECRB), extensor digitorum communis (EDC), extensor carpi ulnaris (ECU), and anconeus. Premotor time (PMT) was the duration from an audio cue to the onset of muscle activity, and motor time (MT) was the onset of muscle activity to the onset of wrist extension. Standard clinical assessments of LE were also performed. RESULTS RT was significantly slower (33; 95% CI, 1-66 ms) in the LE group. There were no group differences in PMT and the order of muscle activation. Instead, the MT of ECRB (18; 95% CI, 6-31 ms), EDC (12; 95% CI, 1-23 ms), ECU (28; 95% CI, 9-46 ms), and anconeus (33; 95% CI, 11-56 ms) showed significant delay in LE group. Regression analyses revealed that the duration of LE could predict RT, ECRB, and anconeus PMT, whereas cold pain threshold predicted ECRB MT. CONCLUSIONS Delayed RT in LE was predominantly caused by deficits in ECRB and EDC MT. This study provides preliminary evidence that in the people with longer LE symptoms, duration appeared to have faster RT, although confirmation of this finding is required before firm conclusions can be drawn.","Manickaraj, Nagarajan; Bisset, Leanne M; Ryan, Michael; Kavanagh, Justin J",Medicine and science in sports and exercise,https://doi.org/10.1249/mss.0000000000000815; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26559453/,192

MATERIALS AND METHODS 108 ex vivo MWA procedures were performed in freshly harvested pig livers. Antennas were inserted parallel to non-perfused and perfused (700,1400 ml/min) glass tubes (diameter 5mm) at different distances (10, 15, 20mm). Ablation zones (radius, area) were analyzed and compared (Kruskal-Wallis Test, Dunn's multiple comparison Test). Temperature changes adjacent to the tubes were measured throughout the ablation cycle. RESULTS Maximum temperature decreased significantly with increasing flow and distance (p<0.05). Compared to non-perfused tubes, ablation zones were significantly deformed by perfused tubes within 15 mm distance to the antenna (p<0.05). At a flow rate of 700 ml/min ablation zone radius was reduced to 37.2% and 80.1% at 10 and 15 mm tube distance, respectively; ablation zone area was reduced to 50.5% and 89.7%, respectively. CONCLUSION Significant changes of ablation zones were demonstrated in a pig liver model. Considerable heat sink effect was observed within a diameter of 15 mm around simulated vessels, dependent on flow rate. This has to be taken into account when ablating liver lesions close to vessels.","Ringe, Kristina I; Lutat, Carolin; Rieder, Christian; Schenk, Andrea; Wacker, Frank; Raatschen, Hans-Juergen",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0134301; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26222431/,192

77119,Highlights from this issue.,2016,"OBJECTIVE The objective of this review was to identify the characteristics of Indigenous healing strategies in Canada and culturally relevant approaches within Indigenous contexts. INTRODUCTION In responding to Canadian Truth and Reconciliation Calls to Action, there is increasing interest in Indigenous healing strategies across clinical, policy, and community sectors. The high relevance of Indigenous healing has also encouraged exploration of new approaches to research that are responsive to, and inclusive of, Indigenous contexts. To date, there is no clear understanding of what characterizes Indigenous healing strategies in Canada. INCLUSION CRITERIA This review considered healing strategies for First Nations, Inuit, and Métis in Canada. Strategies examined included those related to health services and programs, policies and guidelines, models and frameworks, and Indigenous narratives and expert opinion in any service setting. METHODS This review employed the JBI approach to scoping reviews. Searches were performed in CINAHL Full Text, Sociological Abstracts, PsycINFO, MEDLINE, and Academic Search Premier in December 2018. Searches for gray literature were conducted in iPortal, Canadian Electronic Library, and a list of Canadian government and Indigenous organization websites in February 2019. This review was limited to publications from 2008. Non-English articles and theses and dissertations were excluded. RESULTS Among the 59 articles included in this review, 41 were journal articles and 28 were published within the last five years (i.e., 2014 and onward). The healing strategies were most frequently implemented in Ontario (n = 13), British Columbia (n = 8) and Manitoba (n = 5). The majority of strategies were utilized in the health setting (n = 37), which included mainstream treatment modalities as well as community-based healing initiatives. Services and programs (n = 24) were the predominant type of healing strategies, followed by models and frameworks (n = 9); policies and guidelines (n = 8); Indigenous narratives and expert opinion (n = 7); and others (n = 11). The most frequent guiding principles were identified as Honoring Cultures and Traditions (n = 14), Medicine Wheel (n = 12), and Strength-Based/Empowerment (n = 12). The most widely used main components were Artistic Expression (n = 16), Ceremonies (n = 15), and Games and Exercises (n = 12). As for human resources, Community Members (n = 19) were most frequently engaged, followed by Local Agencies (n = 12), and Knowledge Keepers (n = 12). Eight culturally relevant approaches were identified from 29 primary research studies, with the most popular being Consultation/Participatory Research (n = 20) and Indigenous Protocols (n = 5). CONCLUSIONS The findings of this review collectively support a decolonizing approach that upholds Indigenous knowledge, respects Indigenous rights to self-determination, and recognizes Indigenous resilience and agency. More research is needed with a focus on Inuit or Métis healing, and innovative knowledge synthesis methods inclusive of diverse Indigenous ways of knowing.","Yu, Ziwa; Steenbeek, Audrey; Biderman, Maya; Macdonald, Marilyn; Carrier, Leah; MacDonald, Cathy",JBI evidence synthesis,https://doi.org/10.11124/jbisrir-d-19-00385; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32833788/,192
77196,A few minutes with Donna S. Watson.,2015,"COVID-19 is a coronavirus pandemic, caused by the novel coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) severe acute respiratory syndrome. The devastating impact of this novel coronavirus outbreak has necessitated the need for rapid and effective anti-viral therapies against SARS-CoV-2, to contain the spread of disease and importantly, alleviate the severe life-threatening symptoms and disorders. Drug repurposing strategy offers an attractive, immediate and realistic approach to tackle this growing pandemic of COVID-19. Due to the similarities with SARS-CoV-1 virus and phylogenetic relation to MERS-CoV virus, accelerated screening of approved drugs and development of repositioning strategies have proved to be critical in the survival of many COVID-19 patients. Numerous scientific investigations from the initial years of coronavirus outbreak along with upcoming advances of immunotherapy and vaccines may prove to be beneficial. Currently, several repurposing strategies are under different phases of clinical trials and provide with definitive framework for the development of future therapies for the effective treatment of COVID-19. This review article summarizes the latest developments and trends in drug repurposing strategy for COVID-19 treatment.","Akilesh, Sai M; Rajesh J,; Palanisamy, Dhanabal; Wadhwani, Ashish",Current pharmaceutical biotechnology,https://doi.org/10.2174/1389201021999200820155927; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32867651/,192

MATERIALS AND METHODS Retrospective cohort analysis of patients subjected to PA or NE for SRM (< 5 cm) from January 2006 to August 2016. A total of 231 patients with T1 SRM were included in the main analysis. Patient demographics, tumor characteristics, biopsy and procedural details, clinical outcomes, complication rates, and changes in renal function were compared in patients with malignant SRMs. Survival rates were compared using log-rank test. RESULTS A total of 142 patients underwent PA and 89 patients underwent NE, with a respective mean follow-up period of 2.50 (SD 1.77) and 1.85 (SD 0.97) years (P = 0.029). Rate of intervention for benign tumors was similar in PA (n = 21, 15%) and NE (n = 16, 18%; P = 0.520) without routine pre-procedural biopsy. Routine pre-procedural biopsy resulted in zero benign tumors treated in the PA cohort. Tumor recurrence was similar and cumulative survival was similar in both groups (P = 0.287). Residual tumor was observed in 18 PA patients. Complication rates were lower for PA than for NE (9 vs 30%, P < 0.001). A significant reduction in eGFR was observed after NE (12.1 mL/min/1.73 m2; P = 0.009) relative to PA (5.9 mL/min/1.73 m2; P = 0.060). CONCLUSION PA is a safe alternative to NE in the treatment of SRM, with similar overall survival and decreased complication rates.

Herein we investigated the anti-MERS-CoV activity of newly synthesized sixteen halogenated triazole compounds through the inhibition of helicase activity using the FRET assay. All new compounds underwent justification for their target structures via microanalytical and spectral data. SAR studies were performed. Biological results revealed that the most potent compounds were 4-(cyclopent-1-en-3-ylamino)-5-(2-(4-iodophenyl)hydrazinyl)-4H-1,2,4-triazole-3-thiol (16) and 4-(cyclopent-1-en-3-ylamino)-5-[2-(4-chlorophenyl)hydrazinyl]-4H-1,2,4-triazole-3-thiol (12). In silico molecular docking of the most potent compounds was performed to the active binding site of MERS-CoV helicase nsp13. Molecular docking results are in agreement with experimental findings.","Zaher, Nashwa Hafez; Mostafa, Mohammed Ismail; Altaher, Abdullah Yousef",Acta pharmaceutica,https://doi.org/10.2478/acph-2020-0024; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31955138/,192

What have we learned?,2020-10-01,"Medically complex children including infants undergoing cardiac surgery are at increased risk for hospital readmissions. Investigation of this population may reveal opportunities to optimize systems and coordination of care. A retrospective study of all infants undergoing cardiac surgery from 2015 through 2016 at a large tertiary institution who were readmitted within 1 year of discharge from cardiac surgical hospitalization was performed. Data specific to patient characteristics, surgical hospitalization, and readmission hospitalization are described. Unplanned readmissions within 1 year of hospital discharge were analyzed with Cox proportional hazard regression to identify factors associated with increased hazard for earlier unplanned readmission. Comparable to previous reports, 12% (78/658) of all surgical hospitalizations were associated with unplanned readmission within 30 days. Infectious etiology, followed by cardiac and gastrointestinal problems, was the most common reasons for unplanned 30-day readmission. Unplanned readmissions within 2 weeks of discharge were multifactorial and less commonly related to cardiac or surgical care. Primary nasogastric tube feeding at the time of discharge was the only significant risk factor for earlier unplanned readmission (p = 0.032) on multivariable analysis. Increased care coordination with particular attention to feeding and comorbidity management may be future targets to effectively mitigate readmissions and improve quality of care in this population.","Berry, Anna E; Ghanayem, Nancy S; Guffey, Danielle; Anderson, Meghan; Heinle, Jeffrey S; Mery, Carlos M; Watrin, Carmen H; Elhoff, Justin J",Pediatric cardiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00246-021-02631-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33974090/,192

METHODS An integrative review was performed by two independent researchers, based on the literature available in the MEDLINE (via PubMed) and LILACS databases, using the descriptors ""pregnancy"" AND ""COVID-19"" AND ""vertical transmission"". This search included case reports or case series published up until 17th June 2020 in English or Portuguese. After reading the articles available in their entirety, those related specifically to the potential risks of vertical transmission of COVID-19 during pregnancy were selected. We initially found a total of 57 articles; 26 were carefully screened and 15 were finally selected. RESULTS Pregnancy can make women more susceptible to infections, especially by viral pathogens, given the various physiological and immunological changes that occur to maintain maternal-fetal balance. It is speculated that the fetus may be a possible target for COVID-19. Few studies (3 out of 15) in our analysis have found positive results for SARS-CoV-2 in fetal membranes, placenta, and in newborns right after birth. Additionally, no difference was noticed when comparing different modes of delivery, and seems reasonable to assume that pregnant women with stable clinical conditions can be encouraged for vaginal delivery. CONCLUSION Further studies with a great number of cases are warranted to elucidate whether the virus may be vertically transmitted to the fetus and if any maternal conditions can influence that. Our findings seem to demonstrate that vertical transmission is possible but quite unusual.","Oliveira, Lisiane Vital de; Silva, Camila Radelley Azevedo Costa da; Lopes, Lorenna Peixoto; Agra, Isabela Karine Rodrigues",Revista da Associacao Medica Brasileira,https://doi.org/10.1590/1806-9282.66.s2.130; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32965371/,192

Between 2005-2007, 95 pet and 10 feral cats tested negative by indirect immunofluorescence antibody (IFA) analysis using two strains of type II FCoV, two transmissible gastroenteritis virus assays, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and rapid immunomigration test. Twenty-four samples (23%) showed non-specific fluorescence, mostly attributable to anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA). The reason for ANA was unclear: reactive samples were negative for Erhlichia canis antibodies; seven were feline immunodeficiency virus positive, but 15 were negative. It was not possible to determine retrospectively whether the cats had autoimmune disease, hyperthyroidism treatment, or recent vaccination which may also cause ANA. The FCoV/ FIP-free status of the Falkland Islands cats should be maintained by FCoV testing incoming cats.

OBJECTIVES The aims of the study were to characterize a large cohort of COVID-19-positive adult patients with AD and to identify predictors of COVID-19-associated hospitalization and mortality. METHODS A population-based nested case-control study was performed. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals of predictors for COVID-19-associated hospitalization and mortality. RESULTS Of 78,073 adult patients with AD, 3618 (4.6%) tested positive for COVID-19. Subclinical COVID-19 infection occurred in 3368 (93.1%) of COVID-19-positive patients, whereas 123 (3.4%), 46 (1.3%), 55 (1.5%), and 26 (0.7%) patients developed a mild, moderate, severe, and critical disease, respectively. Altogether, 250 patients (6.0%) were hospitalized, and 40 patients (1.1%) died because of COVID-19 complications. Coronavirus disease 2019-associated hospitalization was independently associated with the intake of extended courses of systemic corticosteroids (adjusted odds ratio, 1.96; 95% confidence interval, 1.23-3.14; P = 0.005). None of AD-related variables independently predicted COVID-19-associated mortality. The presence of comorbid metabolic syndrome, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic renal failure, and depression projected both COVID-19-associated hospitalization and mortality. CONCLUSIONS Prolonged systemic corticosteroids during the pandemic are associated with increased odds of COVID-19-associated hospitalization and should be avoided in patients with AD.","Kridin, Khalaf; Schonmann, Yochai; Tzur Bitan, Dana; Damiani, Giovanni; Weinstein, Orly; Cohen, Arnon D","Dermatitis : contact, atopic, occupational, drug",https://doi.org/10.1097/der.0000000000000772; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34138775/,192

The combination of intraperitoneal and systemic chemotherapy seems rational, and the aim of this systematic review was to compare PIPAC directed monotherapy with a bidirectional treatment approach (PIPAC in combination with systemic chemotherapy). Main outcomes were survival and quality of life. METHODS A systematic literature search in Medline, Embase, Cochrane and the ""Pleura and Peritoneum"" was conducted and analyzed according to PRISMA guidelines. Studies in English reporting on bidirectional treatment with PIPAC and systemic chemotherapy and published before April 2019 were included. RESULTS Twelve studies with a total of 386 patients were included. None were specifically designed to compare mono- versus bidirectional treatment, but 44% of the patients received bidirectional treatment. This was more frequent in women (non-gynecological cancers) and one-third of the bidirectional treated patients had received no prior chemotherapy. Data from the included studies provided no conclusions regarding survival or quality of life. CONCLUSION Bidirectional treatment with PIPAC and systemic chemotherapy is practised and feasible, and some patients are enrolled having received no prior systemic chemotherapy for their PM. The difficulty in drawing any conclusions based on this systematic review has highlighted the urgent need to improve and standardize reports on PIPAC directed therapy.

80773,Corrigendum.,2014-06-01,"The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) pandemic has resulted in a rapid shift to telehealth and many services that need in-person care have been avoided. Yet, as practices and payment policies return to a new normal, there will be many questions about what proportion of visits should be done in-person vs telehealth. Using the 2016 National Ambulatory Medical Survey (NAMCS), we estimated what proportion of visits were amenable to telehealth before COVID-19 as a guide. We divided services into those that needed in-person care and those that could be done via telehealth. Any visit that included at least 1 service where in-person care was needed was counted as an in-person only visit. We then calculated what proportion of reported visits and services in 2016 could have been provided via telehealth, as well as what proportion of in-person only services were done by primary care. We found that 66% of all primary care visits reported in NAMCS in 2016 required an in-person service. 90% of all wellness visits and immunizations were done in primary care offices, as were a quarter of all Papanicolaou smears. As practices reopen, patients will need to catch up on many of the in-person only visits that were postponed such as Papanicolaou smears and wellness visits. At the same time, patients and clinicians now accustomed to telehealth may have reservations about returning to in-person only visits. Our estimates may provide a guide to practices as they navigate how to deliver care in a post-COVID-19 environment.","Jabbarpour, Yalda; Jetty, Anuradha; Westfall, Matthew; Westfall, John",Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine : JABFM,https://doi.org/10.3122/jabfm.2021.s1.200247; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33622832/,192

Studies were appraised for surgical indications, outcomes and study design. RESULTS Eleven publications with 170 cases were included. Eight articles reported on acellular dermal matrix use in oncological reconstruction. Most studies were case series; no high-level evidence studies were identified. Graft extrusion was more common in non-oncological applications. In general, post-oncological reconstruction with an acellular dermal matrix demonstrated complication rates similar to those reported without an acellular dermal matrix.

OBJECTIVE To compare a relatively new supraglottic airway device, the Supreme Laryngeal Mask Airway (SLMA), with the CLMA in a cardiac arrest scenario. METHODS Fifty healthcare professionals inexperienced in advanced airway management attempted to insert both airway devices in a manikin in 2 scenarios: in the first, chest compressions were not performed (non-CPR scenario), and in the second, uninterrupted chest compressions were performed (CPR scenario). The primary end points were insertion time and success rate at first attempt. The level of self-confidence of each participant was recorded. RESULTS SLMA achieves faster insertion times both in the non-CPR (SLMA: 10.4 ± 2.7 seconds vs CLMA: 13.4 ± 3.2 seconds, P < .05) and in the CPR scenario (SLMA: 9.9 ± 2.0 seconds Vs CLMA: 11.9 ± 2.3 seconds, P < .05). The difference between first attempt success rates was not statistically significant both in the non-CPR (SLMA: 96% vs CLMA: 90%, P = .18) and in the CPR scenario (SLMA: 98% vs CLMA: 94%, P = .32). The participants are more self-confident using SLMA instead of CLMA (P < .001) and 94% of them would prefer SLMA for future use. CONCLUSION SLMA could be a useful alternative to CLMA during CPR in the hands of healthcare professionals with minimal experience in airway management.","Chloros, Thomas; Xanthos, Theodoros; Iacovidou, Nicoletta; Bassiakou, Eleni",The American journal of emergency medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajem.2013.10.048; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24332907/,192

This pandemic significantly impacted the mental health of communities around the globe. This project draws data from available research to quantify COVID-19 mental health issues and its prevalence in China during the early period of the COVID-19 crisis. It is believed that this pooling of data will give fair estimate of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health. METHODS We conducted this study in accordance with PRISMA guidelines 2009. The protocol for this review is registered and published in PROSPERO (CRD42020182893). The databases used were Pubmed, Medline, Google scholar and Scopus. The studies were extracted according to pre-defined eligibility criteria and risk of bias assessment was conducted. The Meta-analysis was done using OpenMeta [analyst]. RESULTS Total of 62382 participants in nineteen studies fulfilled the eligibility criteria. Stress was the most prevalent (48.1%) mental health consequence of Covid-19 pandemic, followed by depression (26.9%) and anxiety (21.8%). After performing subgroup analysis, prevalence of depression and anxiety in both females and frontline health care workers were high as compared to the prevalence in general Chinese population. CONCLUSION The prevalence of depression and anxiety is moderately high whereas pooled prevalence of stress was found to be very high in Chinese people during this Covid-19 crisis.","Bareeqa, Syeda Beenish; Ahmed, Syed Ijlal; Samar, Syeda Sana; Yasin, Waqas; Zehra, Sani; Monese, George M; Gouthro, Robert V",International journal of psychiatry in medicine,https://doi.org/10.1177/0091217420978005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33243029/,192

We aim to build a stable system with highly reproducible radiomics features, which can make diagnostic performance independent of datasets bias and segmentation methods. METHOD We applied a dataset of 267 patients including 136 malignant and 131 benign tumors from two MRI manufacturers, where 211 cases from a Philips system and 55 cases from a GE system. First, manual annotations, 3D-Unet and 2D-Unet were applied as different segmentation methods. Second, we designed and extracted 3172 features from six modalities of DCE-MRI based on BI-RADS. Third, the feature selection was conducted. Between-class distance was utilized to eliminate the effect of dataset bias caused by two machines. Concordance correlation coefficient, intraclass correlation coefficient and deviation were employed to evaluate the influence of three segmentation methods. We further eliminated features redundancy using genetic algorithm. Finally, three classifiers including support vector machine (SVM), the bagged trees and K-Nearest Neighbor were evaluated by their performance for diagnosing malignant and benign tumors. RESULTS A total of 246 features were preserved to have high stability and reproducibility. The final feature set showed the robust performance under these factors and achieved the area under curve of 0.88, the accuracy of 0.824, the sensitivity of 0.844, the specificity of 0.807 in differentiating benign and malignant tumors with the SVM classifier using manually segmentation results. CONCLUSION The final selected 246 features are reproducible and show little dependence on segmentation methods and data perturbation. The high stability and effectiveness of diagnosis across these factors illustrate that the preserved features can be used for prognostic analysis and help radiologists in the diagnosis of breast cancer.","Qiao, Mengyun; Li, Chengkang; Suo, Shiteng; Cheng, Fang; Hua, Jia; Xue, Dan; Guo, Yi; Xu, Jianrong; Wang, Yuanyuan",International journal of computer assisted radiology and surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11548-020-02177-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388693/,192

However, the choice of initial modality is still controversial. The aim of this study was to show the clinical outcome of the strategy of initial VCE, followed by DBE. METHODS Eighty-nine consecutive overt OGIB patients who had undergone VCE as the initial examination were analyzed. The interpreters of VCE evaluated the necessity of performing DBE, and the antegrade or retrograde route was chosen, depending on the transit time of the capsule. RESULTS Thirty-seven patients (42 %) underwent DBE depending on the findings of VCE. Of these, bleeding sites in the small bowel were identified in 29 patients with the initially selected route (21 antegrade and 8 retrograde). The remaining 8 later underwent DBE by the other route, but 7 had no bleeding lesion, which was confirmed by second-look VCE. One remaining patient had a jejunal varix found by VCE, but DBE from either side could not reach the lesion. The sensitivity and negative predictive value of VCE were 100 %, both for the presence of small bowel lesions and the requirement of hemostasis in the small bowel; this indicated that VCE never misses relevant findings in the small bowel, and that negative VCE findings correspond to the lack of necessity for further examination. CONCLUSIONS VCE as the initial examination can efficiently identify overt OGIB patients who require DBE. The strategy of initial VCE for overt OGIB appears to be reasonable.","Maeda, Yoshimasa; Moribata, Kosaku; Deguchi, Hisanobu; Inoue, Izumi; Maekita, Takao; Iguchi, Mikitaka; Tamai, Hideyuki; Kato, Jun; Ichinose, Masao",BMC gastroenterology,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12876-015-0362-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26467439/,192

83199,Convergent Synthesis of Fluoroalkenes Using a Dual-Reactive Unit.,2021-01-05,"The growing British waste management sector has consistently voiced the need to improve the quality of waste streams and thus the value of secondary resources produced, in order to achieve higher reprocessing rates. Mismanagement of wastes that may lead to contamination and degradation of the recyclate feedstock constitutes one of the main barriers in the pathway to a circular economy. The sector has also repeatedly called upon manufacturers to collaborate in designing materials, components and products (MCPs) with properties that aid recovery, refurbishing, repair and recycling (e.g. separabilty of materials, clear labelling), as waste managers recognise the value of early engagement well before MCPs enter the supply chain (i.e. before MCPs are produced and distributed to the end user). Nonetheless, progress has been slow with regard to improved design for promoting components and products longevity and segregation at source when they reach their end-of-use or end-of-life stage in order to promote circularity. China's ban on imports of low quality recyclates at the end of 2017 marked the beginning of a new era in waste management. It drew attention to UK's dependence on export of low-value secondary resources, placing 'quality' in the spotlight. This article delves into the notion of quality; how quality is understood and assessed at different parts of the MCPs lifecycle, and how it might be systematically measured. A typology to distinguish avoidable and unavoidable designed and created characteristics at all stages of MCPs lifecycle is proposed to provide industry with a tool to design wastes out of the economy. The typology's application is demonstrated using the single-use plastic bottles as an example.","Iacovidou, Eleni; Velenturf, Anne P M; Purnell, Phil",The Science of the total environment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.07.344; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30086496/,192

The laparoscopic approach has grown in popularity since the first reported case in 1992. This article showcases a method for laparoscopic repair of Morgagni hernias using both primary closure and mesh reinforcement. OPERATIVE APPROACH There were three obese women who presented in adulthood with cardiopulmonary symptoms; in all cases, the symptoms were attributable to local compressive effects of large Morgagni hernias. All three hernias were repaired laparoscopically, first by approximating the diaphragm to the fascia of the anterior abdominal wall, followed by insertion of a composite mesh, tacked to the diaphragm, to buttress the closure. All patients had excellent outcomes with symptom resolution. DISCUSSION This case series describes a method of laparoscopic Morgagni hernia repair using primary closure reinforced with a mesh, with excellent postoperative outcomes. Others have described thoracic or open approaches. The authors feel that the method described herein is likely to reduce recurrence in a patient population who are often overweight or obese and, thus, have a high risk of this complication. Furthermore, we discuss all reported laparoscopic repair cases in the literature and highlight the paucity of evidence on the optimal approach.","Ryan, J M; Rogers, A C; Hannan, E J; Mastrosimone, A; Arumugasamy, M",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10029-018-1760-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29556855/,192

People that become severely immunocompromised may experience JCPyV reactivation, which can cause progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a neurodegenerative disease. Due to a lack of therapeutic options, PML results in fatality or significant debilitation among affected individuals. Cellular internalization of JCPyV is mediated by serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine subfamily 2 receptors (5-HT2Rs) via clathrin-mediated endocytosis. The JCPyV entry process requires the clathrin-scaffolding proteins β-arrestin, adaptor protein 2 (AP2), and dynamin. Further, a β-arrestin interacting domain, the Ala-Ser-Lys (ASK) motif, within the C-terminus of 5-HT2AR is important for JCPyV internalization and infection. Interestingly, 5-HT2R subtypes A, B, and C equally support JCPyV entry and infection, and all subtypes contain an ASK motif, suggesting a conserved mechanism for viral entry. However, the role of the 5-HT2R ASK motifs and the activation of β-arrestin-associated proteins during internalization has not been fully elucidated. Through mutagenesis, the ASK motifs within 5-HT2BR and 5-HT2CR were identified as critical for JCPyV internalization and infectivity. Further, utilizing biochemical pulldown techniques, mutagenesis of the ASK motifs in 5-HT2BR and 5-HT2CR resulted in reduced β-arrestin binding. Utilizing small-molecule chemical inhibitors and RNA interference, G-protein receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) was determined to be required for JCPyV internalization and infection by mediating interactions between β-arrestin and the ASK motif of 5-HT2Rs. These findings demonstrate that GRK2 and β-arrestin interactions with 5-HT2Rs are critical for JCPyV entry by clathrin-mediated endocytosis and resultant infection.IMPORTANCE As intracellular parasites, viruses require a host cell to replicate and cause disease. Therefore, virus-host interactions contribute to viral pathogenesis. JC polyomavirus (JCPyV) infects most of the population, establishing a lifelong asymptomatic infection within the kidney. Under conditions of severe immunosuppression JCPyV may spread to the central nervous system, causing the fatal demyelinating disease progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). Individuals living with HIV or undergoing immunomodulatory therapies are at risk for developing PML. The mechanisms of how JCPyV uses specific receptors on the surface of host cells to initiate internalization and infection is a poorly understood process. We have further identified cellular proteins involved in JCPyV internalization and infection and elucidated their specific interactions that are responsible for activation of receptors. Collectively, these findings illuminate how viruses usurp cellular receptors during infection, contributing to current development efforts for therapeutic options for the treatment or prevention of PML.","Mayberry, Colleen L; Wilczek, Michael P; Fong, Tristan M; Nichols, Sarah L; Maginnis, Melissa S",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02139-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33441347/,192

This puts biobanks at the forefront of responding to the ongoing worldwide outbreak of the severe pandemic, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The leading public health institutions around the world have developed and established interim policies and guidelines for researchers and biobank staff to handle the infectious biospecimens safely and adequately from COVID-19 patients. A study of these important and complementary policies and guidelines is conducted in this study. It should be emphasized that the COVID-19 biospecimens must be collected, processed, and preserved by trained personnel equipped with right personal protective equipment to prevent the transmission of the coronavirus and ensure the specimen quality for testing and research. Six of the leading global public health organizations or institutions included in this study are the World Health Organization, the Pan American Health Organization, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Public Health England, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and the Office of Research at the University of California, San Francisco. In conclusion, following the recommended guidance and policies with extreme precautions is essential to ensure the quality of the collected COVID-19 biospecimens and accuracy of the conducted research or treatment, and prevent any possible transmission. Efforts from cryobiologist and biobanking engineers to optimize the protocol of COVID-19 biospecimen cryopreservation and develop the user-friendly and cost-effective devices are urgently required to meet the urgent and increased needs in the specimen biobanking and transportation.","Gao, Frank; Tao, Liang; Ma, Xiao; Lewandowski, David; Shu, Zhiquan",Biopreservation and biobanking,https://doi.org/10.1089/bio.2020.0099; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33290126/,192

We have developed and evaluated surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF MS) for detection and analysis of multiple proteins for distinguishing individuals with RA from control individuals. METHODS A total of 156 serum samples from 90 RA patients, 30 patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS), and 36 healthy individuals were examined by SELDI technology. Spectral data were analysed by the support vector machine (SVM) approach and potential biomarkers were chosen for system training and were used to construct a diagnostic model. RESULTS Pattern 1, consisting of four protein peaks with m/z values of 3899, 4594, 7566, and 13,842, distinguished RA from the healthy samples with sensitivity of 90.0% and a specificity of 91.7%. Pattern 2, consisting of m/z peaks 4287 and 6471, distinguished RA from AS with a sensitivity of 86.7% and a specificity of 85.0%. CONCLUSION The combination of SELDI-TOF MS and SVM could facilitate the discovery of better biomarkers for RA and also provide a useful tool for molecular diagnosis in the future.","Liu, W; Li, X; Ding, F; Li, Y",Scandinavian journal of rheumatology,https://doi.org/10.1080/03009740701747152; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18415765/,192
85868,BioWeld(®) Tube and surgical glue for experimental sutureless venous microanastomosis.,2010,"INTRODUCTION The optimal method of umbilical hernia repair (UHR) in the obese population, laparoscopic vs open, is not standardized. The purpose of this study was to determine the optimal surgical option for UHR in the obese population. METHODS A retrospective chart review was conducted on 123 obese patients (body mass index [BMI] >30) who underwent UHR from 2003 to 2009 at a single institution. Patients were grouped by surgical approach (open vs laparoscopic). Intraoperative and postoperative courses were compared. Follow-up in the postoperative period was obtained from patient records and telephone interviews. RESULTS Of the 123 patients undergoing UHR, 40 and 83 patients were operated on with the laparoscopic and open approach, respectively. Patients were well matched by demographics as well as comorbidities. No difference in the mean BMI was shown between the laparoscopic and open groups (37 vs 35, P = not significant, respectively). The operative time was significantly prolonged in the laparoscopic group (106 vs 71 minutes, P < .01). Intraoperatively, no complications occurred in either group. In the immediate postoperative period, 1 patient who underwent laparoscopic UHR was readmitted for small bowel obstruction, and 2 patients in the open group were readmitted, 1 for pain control and 1 for wound infection. Follow-up was achieved in 63% of the laparoscopic group and 58% of the open group with a mean follow-up of 15 months in the laparoscopic group and 20 months in the open group (P = not significant). A significant increase in wound infection was reported in the open group with mesh insertion when compared with the laparoscopic procedure (26% vs 4%, P < .05, respectively). No hernia recurrence was shown in the laparoscopic vs the open group with mesh insertion (0% vs 4%, P = not significant, respectively). CONCLUSIONS In obese patients, the laparoscopic approach was associated with a significantly lower rate of postoperative infection and no hernia recurrence. Laparoscopic hernia repair may be the preferred option in the obese patient.","Colon, Modesto J; Kitamura, Riley; Telem, Dana A; Nguyen, Scott; Divino, Celia M",American journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjsurg.2012.02.022; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23153398/,192

BACKGROUND Significant variations in the size and morphology of the RVOT affect the placement of transcatheter pulmonary valves. The Alterra Prestent internally reduces and reconfigures the RVOT, providing a stable landing zone for the 29-mm SAPIEN 3 THV. METHODS Eligible patients had moderate or greater PR, weighed >20 kg, and had RVOT diameter 27 to 38 mm and length >35 mm. The primary endpoint was device success, a 5-item composite: 1 Alterra Prestent deployed in the desired location, 1 SAPIEN 3 THV implanted in the desired location within the Prestent, right ventricular-to-pulmonary artery peak-to-peak gradient <35 mm Hg after THV implantation, less than moderate PR at discharge, and no explantation 24 h post-implantation. The secondary composite endpoint was freedom from THV dysfunction (RVOT/pulmonary valve (PV) reintervention, greater or equal to moderate total PR, mean RVOT/PV gradient ≥ 35 mm Hg at 30 days and 6 months. Descriptive statistics are reported. RESULTS Enrolled patients (N = 15) had a median age and weight of 20 years and 61.7 kg, respectively; 93.3% were in New York Heart Association functional class I or II. Device success was 100%. No staged procedures were necessary. No THV dysfunction was reported to 6 months. No serious safety signals were reported. CONCLUSIONS This early feasibility study demonstrated the safety and functionality of the Alterra Adaptive Prestent in patients with congenital RVOT dysfunction and moderate or greater PR.

We characterized the virome in guano from five common bat species in 9 Northern California roosts and a pool of 5 individual bats. Genomes belonging to 14 viral families known to infect mammals and 17 viral families infecting insects or of unknown tropism were detected. Near or complete genomes of a novel parvovirus, astrovirus, nodavirus, CRESS-DNA viruses and densoviruses and more partial genomes of a novel alphacoronavirus, and bunyavirus were characterized. Lower numbers of reads with >90% amino acid identity to previously described calicivirus, circovirus, adenoviruses, hepatovirus, bocaparvoviruses, and polyomavirus in other bat species were also found likely reflecting their wide distribution among different bats. Unexpectedly a few sequence reads of canine parvovirus 2 and the recently described mouse kidney parvovirus were also detected and their presence confirmed by PCR possibly originating from guano contamination by carnivores and rodents. The majority of eukaryotic viral reads were highly divergent indicating that numerous viruses still remain to be characterized even from such a heavily investigated order as Chiroptera.IMPORTANCE Characterizing the bat virome is important for understanding viral diversity and detecting viral spillover between animal species. Using unbiased metagenomics method, we characterize the virome in guano collected from multiple roosts of common Northern California bat species. We describe several novel viral genomes and report the detection of viruses with close relatives reported in other bat species likely reflecting cross-species transmissions. Viral sequences from well-known carnivore and rodent parvoviruses were also detected whose presence are likely the result of contamination from defecation and urination atop guano and reflect the close interaction of these mammals in the wild.","Li, Yanpeng; Altan, Eda; Reyes, Gabriel; Halstead, Brian; Deng, Xutao; Delwart, Eric",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01713-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33115864/,192

86652,Advances in Separation and Purification of Bioactive Polysaccharides through High-speed Counter-Current Chromatography.,2020-09-08,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE In the last few months five multicentre, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) unequivocally showed the superiority of mechanical thrombectomy in large vessel occlusion acute ischaemic stroke compared to systemic thrombolysis. Despite varying inclusion criteria and time intervals from onset to revascularization overall increases of good functional outcome between 55% and 81% were reported. However, only a minority of screened patients (approximately 1%) were eligible for intra-arterial (IA) therapy. METHODS An investigator-initiated, single-centre, prospective and blinded end-point analysis was performed of 3123 consecutive patients with acute ischaemic stroke presenting between February 2010 and December 2014. RESULTS One hundred and fifty-four patients [4.9%, age (years) mean (SD), median (interquartile range) 71.2 (±14), 74.7 (65.9-81.4)] met the inclusion criteria of sparse early ischaemic signs on initial standard cranial computed tomography (CT) (ASPECT score ≥7), large vessel occlusion in the anterior circulation on CT angiography and start of treatment within 6 h of onset of symptoms. After consensual interdisciplinary treatment decisions 130 patients (4.2%) received IA treatment - in the majority stent-assisted thrombectomy in combination with intravenous (IV) recombinant tissue plasminogen activator - and 24 patients (0.7%) standard IV thrombolysis. On 3 months' follow-up an overall significant improvement of disability (P = 0.05) as measured by the modified Rankin Scale was shown in favour of the IA treatment group. Good functional outcome was achieved in about twice as many patients (IA vs. IV, 41.2% vs. 21.2%; P = 0.078). CONCLUSION By choosing pragmatic inclusion criteria state-of-the-art IA therapy of a specialized tertiary stroke centre can be safely applied under real-world conditions to a higher percentage of patients with similar success to the recently published RCTs.","Nikoubashman, O; Jungbluth, M; Schürmann, K; Müller, M; Falkenburger, B; Tauber, S C; Wiesmann, M; Schulz, J B; Reich, A",European journal of neurology,https://doi.org/10.1111/ene.12944; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26850793/,192
87137,Experimental investigation on the susceptibility of minimal networks to a change in topology and number of oscillators.,2021-02-01,"BACKGROUND Prolonged ileus is one of the most common postoperative complications after colorectal surgery. We sought to investigate the predictors of prolonged ileus following elective colon resections procedures. METHODS The national participant user files of NSQIP databases were utilized to examine the clinical outcomes of patients undergoing elective colon resection during 2012-2013. Multivariate regression analysis was performed to investigate predictors of prolonged ileus. Prolonged ileus was defined as no return of bowel function in 7 days. RESULTS We sampled a total of 27,560 patients who underwent colon resections; of these, 3497 (12.7%) patients had prolonged ileus. Patients with ileocolonic anastomosis (ICA) had a significantly higher rate of prolonged ileus compared to patients with colorectal anastomosis (CRA) (15 vs. 11.5%, AOR 1.25, P < 0.01). Prolonged ileus was significantly associated with intra-abdominal infections (13 vs. 2.8%, AOR 2.56, P < 0.01) and anastomotic leakage (12 vs. 2.4%, AOR 2.50, P < 0.01). Factors such as preoperative sepsis (AOR 1.63, P < 0.01), disseminated cancer (AOR 1.24, P = 0.01), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AOR 1.27, P = 0.02) were associated with an increased risk of prolonged ileus, whereas oral antibiotic bowel preparation (AOR 0.77, P < 0.01) and laparoscopic surgery (AOR 0.51, P < 0.01) are associated with decreased prolonged ileus risk. CONCLUSIONS Prolonged ileus is a common condition following colon resection, with an incidence of 12.7%. Among colon surgeries, colectomy with ICA resulted in the highest rate of postoperative prolonged ileus. Prolonged ileus is positively associated with anastomotic leak and intra-abdominal infections; thus, a high index of suspicion must be had in all patients with prolonged postoperative ileus.","Moghadamyeghaneh, Zhobin; Hwang, Grace S; Hanna, Mark H; Phelan, Michael; Carmichael, Joseph C; Mills, Steven; Pigazzi, Alessio; Stamos, Michael J",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-015-4247-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26017914/,192

Ten types of sutures (absorbable and nonabsorbable), four types of suturing techniques, and eight types of suture anchors (bioabsorbable and metallic) were tested. Material Testing Machine and attached load cell were used to test the biomaterials in ex vivo ovine tissues. The results show that the mean load to failure and stiffness were higher in nonabsorbable sutures. Massive cuff tear and modified Mason-Allen suturing techniques had higher failure strength and stiffness when compared to simple and mattress techniques, but there was no substantial difference between them. Metallic suture anchors had higher failure strength when compared to bioabsorbable ones. Often either in metallic or in bioabsorbable anchors, the eyelet fails first. The failure sequence in ovine tissues is found to be in the following order: simple and mattress suturing techniques, nonabsorbable sutures, massive cuff tear and modified Mason-Allen suturing techniques, bioabsorbable anchors, and metallic anchors. Thus, it is concluded that metallic anchors mounted with modern nonabsorbable sutures will fail last. If we use simple and mattress techniques, the tendon-suture level will fail first, but it will improve substantially using more sophisticated suturing techniques (massive cuff tear or modified Mason-Allen).","Bisbinas, Ilias; Magnissalis, Evangelos; Gigis, Ioannis; Beslikas, Theodoros; Hatzokos, Ippokratis; Christoforidis, Ioannis","Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers.

The lower density and higher viscosity of heliox relative to nitrogen-oxygen mixtures can significantly reduce airway resistance when an anatomic upper air-flow obstruction is present and gas flow is turbulent. Clinically, heliox can decrease airway resistance in acute asthma in adults and children and in COPD. Heliox may also enhance the bronchodilating effects of β-agonist administration for acute asthma. Respiratory syndromes caused by coronavirus infections in humans range in severity from the common cold to severe acute respiratory syndrome associated with human coronavirus OC43 and other viral strains.

In Gram-negative bacteria, the interplay between membrane permeability and drug efflux pumps must be investigated as a whole. Here, we quantified the intracellular accumulation of a series of fluoroquinolones in population and in individual cells of Escherichia coli according to the expression of the AcrB efflux transporter. Computational results supported the accumulation levels measured experimentally and highlighted how fluoroquinolones side chains interact with specific residues of the distal pocket of the AcrB tight monomer during recognition and binding steps.","Vergalli, Julia; Atzori, Alessio; Pajovic, Jelena; Dumont, Estelle; Malloci, Giuliano; Masi, Muriel; Vargiu, Attilio Vittorio; Winterhalter, Mathias; Réfrégiers, Matthieu; Ruggerone, Paolo; Pagès, Jean-Marie",Communications biology,https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-020-0929-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346058/,192
89800,Variational finite element approach to study heat transfer in the biological tissues of premature infants.,2020-08-01,"OBJECTIVES Despite considerable advancement in antiretroviral therapy, development of safe, effective, and multi-targeted drugs for HIV still remains a big challenge. Endophytes are untouched and, hence, an important and novel sources in drug discovery endeavours. The present study was conducted to identify the anti-HIV compounds from Morus alba and endophytes isolated from it. METHODS The extracts of isolated endophytes were screened using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Further, all samples were analysed for their cytotoxicity using a thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide assay. Subsequently, anti-HIV activity was performed using cell-based and cell-free assay. At the end, potential endophytes were identified using gene sequencing. RESULTS A total of 27 endophytes were isolated from the eight stem bark samples of M. alba. Of the 27 endophytes, extracts of total of four endophytes showed a profile similar to the M. alba plant when analysed by HPLC. Further experimentation with extracts of these four endophytes, along with an extract of M. alba stem bark and its bioactive molecule, mulberroside C, revealed that all these six samples have good inhibitory potential for HIV. Among them, mulberroside C and two endophytic fungal extracts showed very potent anti-HIV activity. Subsequently, mechanistic studies at the molecular level showed that out of six test samples, three acted as protease inhibitors. Further, all four potential endophytes were identified using gene sequencing. CONCLUSIONS The overall findings of these studies can help in the development of a novel anti-HIV candidate from mulberroside C, an extract of stem bark of M. alba and extracts of these endophytes. However, further validation and clinical studies are required to develop an anti-HIV drug.","Vora, J; Velhal, S; Sinha, S; Patel, V; Shrivastava, N",HIV medicine,https://doi.org/10.1111/hiv.13116; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33987901/,192
89853,Effect of ablative laser on in vitro transungual delivery.,2018,"BACKGROUND Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is a complex condition with no reliable diagnostic biomarkers. Studies have shown evidence of autonomic dysfunction in patients with ME/CFS, but results have been equivocal. Heart rate (HR) parameters can reflect changes in autonomic function in healthy individuals; however, this has not been thoroughly evaluated in ME/CFS. METHODS A systematic database search for case-control literature was performed. Meta-analysis was performed to determine differences in HR parameters between ME/CFS patients and controls. RESULTS Sixty-four articles were included in the systematic review. HR parameters assessed in ME/CFS patients and controls were grouped into ten categories: resting HR (RHR), maximal HR (HRmax), HR during submaximal exercise, HR response to head-up tilt testing (HRtilt), resting HR variability (HRVrest), HR variability during head-up tilt testing (HRVtilt), orthostatic HR response (HROR), HR during mental task(s) (HRmentaltask), daily average HR (HRdailyaverage), and HR recovery (HRR) Meta-analysis revealed RHR (MD ± 95% CI = 4.14 ± 1.38, P < .001), HRtilt (SMD ± 95% CI = 0.92 ± 0.24, P < .001), HROR (0.50 ± 0.27, P < .001), and the ratio of low frequency power to high frequency power of HRVrest (0.39 ± 0.22, P < .001) were higher in ME/CFS patients compared to controls, while HRmax (MD ± 95% CI = -13.81 ± 4.15, P < .001), HR at anaerobic threshold (SMD ± 95% CI = -0.44 ± 0.30, P = 0.005) and the high frequency portion of HRVrest (-0.34 ± 0.22, P = .002) were lower in ME/CFS patients. CONCLUSIONS The differences in HR parameters identified by the meta-analysis indicate that ME/CFS patients have altered autonomic cardiac regulation when compared to healthy controls. These alterations in HR parameters may be symptomatic of the condition.","Nelson, Maximillian J; Bahl, Jasvir S; Buckley, Jonathan D; Thomson, Rebecca L; Davison, Kade",Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000017600; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651868/,192

Blood work revealed profound hypoglycemia and results of a paired insulin glucose test were consistent with an insulinoma. Abdominal ultrasound revealed a solitary pancreatic mass, and results of a fine-needle aspirate (FNA) gave further support for the location of the neuroendocrine tumor. After unsuccessful medical management of the hypoglycemia, the mass was surgically removed. Immunohistochemistry confirmed that it was an insulinoma. At the time of writing, the patient had been in clinical remission for 9 months. Relevance and novel information Feline insulinomas are rare and there is very little information on their behavior, clinical course and histologic characteristics. This is the first reported case of an insulinoma in a Maine Coon cat and the first to describe results of an ultrasound-guided FNA of the mass. In addition, the progression of disease, histopathology and immunohistochemistry results add to the currently minimal database for feline insulinomas.","Gifford, Carol H; Morris, Anita P; Kenney, Kurt J; Estep, J Scot",JFMS open reports,https://doi.org/10.1177/2055116919894782; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32110425/,192

Nigeria is a large country with a complex diversity of religious, ethnic and cultural practices that condition the reception and elaboration of science in everyday life. We find evaluative attitudes to science structured as 'progress', 'fear' and 'mythical image'. Scientific knowledge and religiosity have a direct bearing on expectations of progress and feeling of fear and worry about science; mythical image is independent of this. Nigerians trust both scientific and religious authorities in contrast to other social actors. Many of the results are consistent with the hypothesis of cognitive polyphasia of scientific and religious knowing manifesting as a 'hierarchy', when one form is elevated over the other; 'parallelity', when both serve separate functions; and 'empowerment', where one enhances the other.","Falade, Bankole A; Bauer, Martin W",Public understanding of science,https://doi.org/10.1177/0963662517690293; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28194998/,192

The pandemic has also disproportionately affected historically marginalized and at-risk communities, including people of color, socioeconomically disadvantaged people, people identifying as female, and youth. OBJECTIVE This study aimed to understand differences in depression and anxiety among two groups of US adolescents before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to examine demographic and daily activity variables associated with depression and anxiety. METHODS Online surveys were distributed in 2019 and 2020. Analyses of covariance compared depression and anxiety between pre-pandemic and pandemic groups. Demographic and lifestyle variables were included as covariates. RESULTS Within the pandemic group, 94% of adolescents reported being out of school due to the pandemic, and another 86% and 57% were prevented from extracurricular activities or exercise, respectively. The pandemic group trended towards higher depression, with least squares adjusted means 7.62 ±1.36, compared to 6.28 ±1.42 (P=.08) in the pre-pandemic group. There was no significant difference in anxiety scores between pandemic and pre-pandemic groups, with least squares adjusted means 5.52 ±1.30 vs. 5.01 ±1.36 (P=.48). Within the pandemic group, lower socioeconomic status was predictive of anxiety, such that those in the pandemic group of lower SES were more anxious than their higher SES peers, with least squares adjusted means 11.17 ±2.34 vs. 8.66 ±2.16 (P=.02). Within the pandemic group, being out of work, school, extracurricular activities, or exercise due to the pandemic was not associated with higher depression or anxiety scores. CONCLUSIONS In the present study, neither being in the pandemic group, nor experiencing changes in daily activity due to the pandemic, were associated with higher depression or anxiety. However, we found that adolescents from lower socioeconomic backgrounds experienced significantly more anxiety during the pandemic than their more privileged peers. Both instrumental and mental health interventions for less privileged adolescents are imperative.

92314,Thermal screening of facial skin arterial hot spots using non-contact infrared radiometry.,2008,"Clinical history, questionnaire data and response to antisecretory therapy are insufficient to make a conclusive diagnosis of GERD in isolation, but are of value in determining need for further investigation. Conclusive evidence for reflux on oesophageal testing include advanced grade erosive oesophagitis (LA grades C and D), long-segment Barrett's mucosa or peptic strictures on endoscopy or distal oesophageal acid exposure time (AET) >6% on ambulatory pH or pH-impedance monitoring. A normal endoscopy does not exclude GERD, but provides supportive evidence refuting GERD in conjunction with distal AET <4% and <40 reflux episodes on pH-impedance monitoring off proton pump inhibitors. Reflux-symptom association on ambulatory reflux monitoring provides supportive evidence for reflux triggered symptoms, and may predict a better treatment outcome when present. When endoscopy and pH or pH-impedance monitoring are inconclusive, adjunctive evidence from biopsy findings (histopathology scores, dilated intercellular spaces), motor evaluation (hypotensive lower oesophageal sphincter, hiatus hernia and oesophageal body hypomotility on high-resolution manometry) and novel impedance metrics (baseline impedance, postreflux swallow-induced peristaltic wave index) can add confidence for a GERD diagnosis; however, diagnosis cannot be based on these findings alone. An assessment of anatomy, motor function, reflux burden and symptomatic phenotype will therefore help direct management. Future GERD management strategies should focus on defining individual patient phenotypes based on the level of refluxate exposure, mechanism of reflux, efficacy of clearance, underlying anatomy of the oesophagogastric junction and psychometrics defining symptomatic presentations.","Gyawali, C Prakash; Kahrilas, Peter J; Savarino, Edoardo; Zerbib, Frank; Mion, Francois; Smout, André J P M; Vaezi, Michael; Sifrim, Daniel; Fox, Mark R; Vela, Marcelo F; Tutuian, Radu; Tack, Jan; Bredenoord, Albert J; Pandolfino, John; Roman, Sabine",Gut,https://doi.org/10.1136/gutjnl-2017-314722; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29437910/,192

93203,Acute surgical wound-dressing procedure: Description of the steps involved in the development and validation of an observational metric.,2019,"BACKGROUND COVID-19 restrictions have significantly limited access to in-person educational and healthcare services for all, including individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDDs). The objectives of this online survey that included both national and international families were to capture changes in access to healthcare and educational services for individuals with IDDs that occurred shortly after restrictions were initiated and to survey families on resources that could improve services for these individuals. METHODS This was an online survey for caregivers of individuals with (1) a genetic diagnosis and (2) a neurodevelopmental diagnosis, including developmental delay, intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder or epilepsy. The survey assessed (1) demographics, (2) changes in access to educational and healthcare services and (3) available and preferred resources to help families navigate the changes in service allocation. RESULTS Of the 818 responses (669 within the USA and 149 outside of the USA), most families reported a loss of at least some educational or healthcare services. Seventy-four per cent of parents reported that their child lost access to at least one therapy or education service, and 36% of respondents lost access to a healthcare provider. Only 56% reported that their child received at least some continued services through tele-education. Those that needed to access healthcare providers did so primarily through telemedicine. Telehealth (both tele-education and telemedicine) was reported to be helpful when available, and caregivers most often endorsed a need for an augmentation of these remote delivery services, such as 1:1 videoconference sessions, as well as increased access to 1:1 aides in the home. CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 restrictions have greatly affected access to services for individuals with syndromic IDDs. Telehealth may provide opportunities for delivery of care and education in a sustainable way, not only as restrictions endure but also after they have been lifted.","Jeste, S; Hyde, C; Distefano, C; Halladay, A; Ray, S; Porath, M; Wilson, R B; Thurm, A",Journal of intellectual disability research : JIDR,https://doi.org/10.1111/jir.12776; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32939917/,192
93379,Cervical vertebral canal endoscopy in a horse with cervical vertebral stenotic myelopathy.,2012,"BACKGROUND The COVID-19 pandemic represents one of the most stressful events of recent times. Among the population, healthcare professionals who treat COVID-19 patients are most likely to develop psychological distress and posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). The present study thus aimed to investigate the psychological impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on Italian healthcare workers. METHODS The responses of 145 healthcare workers (72 medical doctors and 73 nurses) were included in the final dataset. Participants were asked to provide sociodemographic and clinical information, and to complete: (a) quality of life and health-related Visual Analogue Scales, (b) State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-Form Y1, (c) Beck Depression Inventory, and (d) PTSD Checklist for DSM-5. RESULTS A comparison between healthcare professionals working in COVID-19 wards and other units revealed that the former reported higher levels of both depressive symptoms and PTSS. Moreover, the results of regression analyses showed that in healthcare professionals working with COVID-19 patients, gender and marital status, and gender and age significantly predicted depressive symptoms and PTSS, respectively. Particularly, being female and not in a relationship were found to be associated with higher levels of depressive symptoms, whereas being female and older were found to be related to higher levels of PTSS. CONCLUSIONS The current findings suggest that specific predisposing factors could identify healthcare workers who are at high risk of developing mental health symptoms when faced with COVID-19 patients.","Di Tella, Marialaura; Romeo, Annunziata; Benfante, Agata; Castelli, Lorys",Journal of evaluation in clinical practice,https://doi.org/10.1111/jep.13444; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32710481/,192

The specific goals were: to develop practical recommendations for clinicians on patient selection; to identify barriers to surgical access and suggest interventions for health policy changes that ensure equitable access to surgery when indicated; and to identify priorities for research. Bariatric surgery can significantly improve glycaemic control in severely obese patients with Type 2 diabetes. It is an effective, safe and cost-effective therapy for obese Type 2 diabetes. Surgery can be considered an appropriate treatment for people with Type 2 diabetes and obesity not achieving recommended treatment targets with medical therapies, especially in the presence of other major co-morbidities. The procedures must be performed within accepted guidelines and require appropriate multidisciplinary assessment for the procedure, comprehensive patient education and ongoing care, as well as safe and standardized surgical procedures.

93682,COVID-19: Gene Transfer to the Rescue?,2020-05-28,"Rotavirus (RV) infection is the main cause of acute dehydrating diarrhea in infants and young children below 5 years old worldwide. RV infection causes a global shutoff of host proteins as many other viruses do. However, previous studies revealed that RV could selectively upregulated the expression of some host proteins that then played important roles in RV infection. To globally explor such host proteins that were upregulated in early human rotavirus (HRV) infection, proteomic methods were used and a total of ten upregulated host proteins were unambiguously identified. Cyclophilin A (CYPA), a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase, was among these upregulated host proteins. Following infection, CYPA was recruited to the viroplasm and interacted with HRV structural protein VP2; CYPA reduced host susceptibility to HRV infection and inhibited replication of HRV by repressing the expression of viral proteins. Furthermore, we found that the increased expression of CYPA in enterocytes of small intestine correlated to the period when BALB/c mice became resistant to RV diarrhea. Together, we identified CYPA as a novel host restriction factor that confered protection against RV infection and might contribute to host susceptibility to RV diarrhea.","He, Haiyang; Mou, Zhirong; Li, Wanling; Fei, Lei; Tang, Yan; Zhang, Ji; Yan, Ping; Chen, Zhengqiong; Yang, Xia; Shen, Zigang; Li, Jintao; Wu, Yuzhang",Proteomics,https://doi.org/10.1002/pmic.201100579; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23303713/,192

Rapid implementation of treatment modifications was required for patients typically characterized by insecure attachment and vulnerability to separation. AIM To investigate immediate reactions to the shutdown of services; alternative treatment received; and differences related to age in a clinical sample of patients with PD. DESIGN A survey performed from June to October 2020 (after the first Covid-19 wave) among 1120 patients from 12 units offering comprehensive group-based PD programs. RESULTS The response-rate was 12% (N = 133). Negative feelings of anxiety, sadness, and helplessness were noteworthy immediate reactions, but the dominating attitude was accommodation. Younger patients (<26 years) reported more skepticism and less relief. Modified treatment was mainly telephone therapy. Digital therapy was less available, but was more frequent among younger patients. A minority received digital group therapy. Most patients rated the frequency and quality of modified treatments as satisfactory in the given situation, but also worried about own treatment progress, lack of group therapy, and 47% missed seeing the therapist when having telephone consultations. CONCLUSION The survey confirms a radical modification from comprehensive group-based PD programs to telephone consultations, low availability of digital consultations and group treatments. Taking a short-term, first wave perspective, the survey indicates a noteworthy capacity among poorly functioning patients for accommodating to a clearly challenging situation, as well as considerable concern about treatment progress.","Kvarstein, Elfrida Hartveit; Zahl, Kjell-Einar; Stänicke, Line Indrevoll; Pettersen, Mona Skjeklesaether; Baltzersen, Åse-Line; Johansen, Merete Selsbakk; Eikenaes, Ingeborg Ulltveit-Moe; Arnevik, Espen Ajo; Hummelen, Benjamin; Wilberg, Theresa; Pedersen, Geir",Nordic journal of psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1080/08039488.2021.1934110; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34126854/,192

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing surgical resection with endovascular treatment in terms of success of treatment, rate of recurrence and complications. A literature search was conducted using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Strength of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation Working Group system. Surgical outcomes such as initial treatment failure, late recurrence, neurological improvement and complications were compared between the two approaches. We included 57 studies with 2029 patients, of which 32 studies with 1341 patients directly compared surgery (n=590) and embolisation (n=751). Surgery was found to be associated with significantly lower odds of initial treatment failure (OR: 0.15, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.24, I2 0%, p<0.001) and late recurrence (OR 0.18, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.39, I2 0%, p<0.001). The odds of neurological improvement following surgery were also significantly higher compared with embolisation alone (OR: 2.73, CI:1.67 to 4.48, I2 :49.5%, p<0.001). No difference in complication rates was observed between the two approaches (OR 1.78, 95% CI 0.97 to 3.26, I2 0%, p=0.063). Onyx was associated with significantly higher odds of initial failure/late recurrence as compared with n-butyl 2-cyanoacrylate (OR: 3.87, CI: 1.73 to 8.68, I2 :0%, p<0.001). Surgery may be associated with superior outcomes for SDAVFs in comparison to endovascular occlusion.

Coagulation necrosis was created in the pig livers by the use of one of three RFA protocols: 1) group A, monopolar RFA using a 15-G Octopus® electrode with a 5-mm inter-electrode distance (n = 4); 2) group B, monopolar RFA using a 15-G Octopus® electrode with a 10-mm inter-electrode distance (n = 6); and 3) group C, switching monopolar RFA using two 15-G Octopus® electrodes (n = 8). The energy efficiency, shape, maximum and minimum diameters (Dmx and Dmi), and the volume of the coagulation volume were measured in each group. The Summary statistics were obtained and Mann-Whitney test was were performed. RESULTS The mean ablated volume of each group was 49.23 cm(3) in A, 64.11 cm(3) in B, and 72.35 cm(3) in C. The mean Dmx and Dmi values were 5.68 cm and 4.58 cm in A and 5.97 cm and 4.97 cm in B, respectively. In group C, the mean diameters of Dmx and Dmi were 6.80 cm and 5.11 cm, respectively. The mean ratios of Dmi/Dmx were 1.25, 1.20, and 1.35 in groups A, B, and C, respectively. There was one animal death during the RFA procedure, the cause of which could not be subsequently determined. However, there were no other significant, procedure-related complications during the seven-hour-delayed CT scans. CONCLUSION RFA procedures using 15-G Octopus® electrodes are useful and safe for creating a large ablation in a single electrode model as well as in the multiple electrodes model.","Lee, Eun Sun; Lee, Jeong Min; Kim, Kyung Won; Lee, In Joon; Han, Joon Koo; Choi, Byung Ihn",Korean journal of radiology,https://doi.org/10.3348/kjr.2013.14.2.194; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23482995/,192
95930,"Correction: Cuscuta seeds: Diversity and evolution, value for systematics/identification and exploration of allometric relationships.",2020,"Researchers have long endeavoured to accumulate triacylglycerols (TAGs) or their derivatives in easily managed microbes. The attempted production of TAGs in Escherichia coli has revealed barriers to the broad applications of this technology, including low TAG productivity and slow cell growth. We have demonstrated that an acyl-CoA-independent pathway can divert phospholipid flux into TAG formation in E. coli mediated by Chlamydomonas reinhardtii phospholipid:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (CrPDAT) without interfering with membrane functions. We then showed the synergistic effect on TAG accumulation via the acyl-CoA-independent pathway mediated by PDAT and the acyl-CoA-dependent pathway mediated by wax ester synthase/acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (WS/DGAT). Furthermore, CrPDAT led to synchronous TAG accumulation during cell growth and this could be enhanced by supplementation of arbutin. We also showed that rationally mutated CrPDAT was capable of decreasing TAG lipase activity without impairing PDAT activity. Finally, ScPDAT from Saccharomyces cerevisiae exhibited similar activities as those of CrPDAT in E. coli Our results suggest that the improvement in accumulation of TAGs and their derivatives can be achieved by fine tuning of phospholipid metabolism in E. coli Understanding the roles of PDAT in the conversion of phospholipids into TAGs during the logarithmic growth phase may enable novel strategies for the production of microbial oils.Importance Although phospholipid:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (PDAT) activity is presumed to exist in prokaryotic oleaginous bacteria, the corresponding gene has not been identified yet. In this manuscript, we have demonstrated that an acyl-CoA-independent pathway can divert phospholipid flux into TAG formation in E. coli mediated by exogenous CrPDAT from C. reinhardtii without interfering with membrane functions. In addition, the acyl-CoA-independent pathway and the acyl-CoA-dependent pathway had the synergistic effect on TAG accumulation. Overexpression of CrPDAT led to synchronous TAG accumulation during cell growth. In particular, CrPDAT possessed multiple catalytic activities and the rational mutation of CrPDAT led to the decrease of TAG lipase activity without impairing acyltransferase activity. The present findings suggested that applying PDAT in E. coli or other prokaryotic microbes may be a promising strategy for accumulation of TAGs and their derivatives.","Wang, Lian; Jiang, Shan; Chen, Wen-Chao; Zhou, Xue-Rong; Huang, Ting-Xuan; Huang, Feng-Hong; Wan, Xia",Applied and environmental microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1128/aem.00999-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32680871/,192

96227,European bioethics - from cyborgs to surrogacy.,2020-09-01,"OBJECTIVES We sought to evaluate trends in pediatric inpatient unit capacity and access and to measure pediatric inpatient unit closures across the United States. METHODS We performed a retrospective study of 4720 US hospitals using the 2008-2018 American Hospital Association survey. We used linear regression to describe trends in pediatric inpatient unit and PICU capacity. We compared trends in pediatric inpatient days and bed counts by state. We examined changes in access to care by calculating distance to the nearest pediatric inpatient services by census block group. We analyzed hospital characteristics associated with pediatric inpatient unit closure in a survival model. RESULTS Pediatric inpatient units decreased by 19.1% (34 units per year; 95% confidence interval [CI] 31 to 37), and pediatric inpatient unit beds decreased by 11.8% (407 beds per year; 95% CI 347 to 468). PICU beds increased by 16.0% (66.9 beds per year; 95% CI 53 to 81), primarily at children's hospitals. Rural areas experienced steeper proportional declines in pediatric inpatient unit beds (-26.1% vs -10.0%). Most states experienced decreases in both pediatric inpatient unit beds (median state -18.5%) and pediatric inpatient days (median state -10.0%). Nearly one-quarter of US children experienced an increase in distance to their nearest pediatric inpatient unit. Low-volume pediatric units and those without an associated PICU were at highest risk of closing. CONCLUSIONS Pediatric inpatient unit capacity is decreasing in the United States. Access to inpatient care is declining for many children, particularly those in rural areas. PICU beds are increasing, primarily at large children's hospitals. Policy and surge planning improvements may be needed to mitigate the effects of these changes.","Cushing, Anna M; Bucholz, Emily M; Chien, Alyna T; Rauch, Daniel A; Michelson, Kenneth A",Pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2020-041723; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34127553/,192

The number of COVID-19 cases continues to rise which is a global burden on the health care system worldwide. Efforts are continuing to come up with a solution either to develop a small molecular inhibitor or vaccine, but still no success. In the fight against SARS-CoV-2, targeting a different protein of the SARS-CoV-2 is the need of the hour to impede and relinquish the current pandemic. Therefore, in this study, computational modelling and simulation approaches are used to target the N-terminal domain of the phosphor-nucleoprotein (RNA binding protein), which is primarily responsible for binding and packing the viral genome to get ribonucleoprotein complex (RNP). Our multi-step drug screening approach shortlisted potential drugs. These top hits were confirmed by re-docking which revealed that the interacting molecules block the key residues i.e. Thr57, His59, Ser105, Arg107, and Arg177 and thus ultimately block the NTD from RNA recognition. Furthermore, the activity of the top four hits was also confirmed by using molecular dynamics simulation and free energy calculation. Our analysis suggests that these top hits possess strong inhibitory properties and should be tested experimentally. In conclusion, we hope these top hits would abrogate the binding of RNA and the NTD of the SARS-CoV-2, which might be helpful to combat COVID-19. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

96817,"Promises and Pitfalls of Latent Variable Approaches to Understanding Psychopathology: Reply to Burke and Johnston, Eid, Junghänel and Colleagues, and Willoughby.",2020-05-16,"BACKGROUND The quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) approach is most widely used for prediction of biological activity of potential medicinal compounds. A QSAR model is developed by correlating the information obtained from chemical structures (numerical descriptors/independent variables) with the experimental response values (the dependent variable). METHODS In the current study, we have developed a QSAR model to predict inhibitory activity of small molecule carboxamides against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) 3CLpro enzyme. Due to the structural similarity of this enzyme with that of SARS-CoV-2, the causative organism of the recent pandemic, the former may be used for development of therapies against corona virus disease 19 (COVID-19). RESULTS The final multiple linear regression (MLR) model was based on four two-dimensional descriptors with definite physicochemical meaning. The model was strictly validated using different internal and external quality metrics. The model showed significant statistical quality in terms of determination cofficient (R20.748, adjusted R2(R2adj 0.700), cross-validated leave-one-out Q2(Q20.628 and external predicted variance (R2pred 0.723). The final validated model was used for the prediction of external set compounds as well as to virtually design a new library of small molecules. We have also performed docking analysis of the most active and least active compounds present in the data set for comparative analysis and to explain the features obtained from the 2D-QSAR model. CONCLUSION The derived model may be useful to predict the inhibitory activity of small molecules within the applicability domain of the model only based on the chemical structure information prior to their synthesis and testing.","Khan, Pathan Mohsin; Kumar, Vinay; Roy, Kunal",Combinatorial chemistry & high throughput screening,https://doi.org/10.2174/1386207323666200914094712; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32928086/,192

Many initial airway device designs were modeled for adult patients and simply downsized for the pediatric population. This paper reviews the last decade's design improvements in video laryngoscopes and supraglottic airway devices (SGAs), as well as advances in noninvasive oxygenation/ventilation techniques for pediatric airway management. Areas covered: Topic areas reviewed include basic principles of common and newer devices for video laryngoscopy, supraglottic airway management, and alternate ventilation techniques. A literature search was conducted in PubMed using device-specific keywords and limited to neonatal, infant, and pediatric populations. Articles were reviewed for evidence deemed high yield by the authors. Device specifications were obtained from manufacturer correspondences. Features, comparisons, advantages, and disadvantages are provided for each device class. We give expert commentary regarding the current state of clinical application, research considerations, as well as a 5-year outlook on potential areas of device design and development. Expert commentary: Video laryngoscopes and SGAs are safe and effective for use in children and improvements continue to be made for neonates and infants.

In this review, we will summarise and put into perspective findings and debates relating to the diverse aspects of cardiovascular involvement of COVID-19. We will review evidence for the role of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), the risk of pre-existing cardiovascular disease in COVID-19 susceptibility and course, and the mechanism of acute and long-term myocardial injury. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) uses membrane-bound angiotensin converting-enzyme-2 (ACE2) as a receptor for cell entry. ACE2 is part of an important counter-regulatory circuit antagonising the harmful effects of angiotensin II on lung and heart. Modulation of ACE2 may therefore affect disease susceptibility and disease course. However, observational clinical studies and one randomised trial have so far not yielded evidence for harmful or beneficial effects of blockers of the RAAS during COVID-19. Age, gender, and multi-morbidity all increase susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. In contrast, pre-existing cardiovascular diseases do so only minimally, but they may aggravate the disease course. Direct SARS-CoV-2 infection of the heart tissue and myocytes is rare. Nevertheless, COVID-19 may lead to myocarditis-like acute cardiac injury, characterised by myocardial oedema, but lacking extensive myocyte loss and lymphocytic infiltration. Independent of this, increases in cardiac biomarkers (troponin, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, D-dimer) are frequent, especially in the phase of severe systemic inflammation and acute respiratory distress syndrome, and quantitatively associated with poor outcome. The pulmonary infection may result initially in right ventricular dysfunction, but in cases with severe systemic infection hypoxia, hyperinflammation and cytokine storm heart failure may eventually ensue. Unlike other infections and inflammatory states, COVID-19 does not appear to trigger acute coronary syndromes. In children, even mild COVID-19 can induce a multisystem inflammatory syndrome with Kawasaki-like symptoms frequently accompanied by cardiogenic shock.","Eberli, Franz Robert; Kurz, David",Swiss medical weekly,https://doi.org/10.4414/smw.2020.20417; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33382450/,192

This study was conducted to investigate whether the polymorphism of CASP3 is responsible for susceptibility and coronary artery lesion (CAL) formation in KD in the Taiwanese population. A total of 1092 subjects (341 KD patients and 751 controls) were investigated to identify an SNP of rs72689236 using Invader assays (Third Wave Technologies). Our data provided a borderline significant association between the genotypes and allele frequency of rs72689236 in control subjects and KD patients (P=0.0535 under the dominant model; P=0.0575 under the allelic model). The A allele of rs72689236 in KD patients and in patients with CAL and intravenous immunoglobulin resistance was seen in a higher frequency. Importantly, a significant association was obtained between rs72689236 and KD patients with aneurysm formation (P=0.009, under the recessive model).

97765,Population statistics: Does child survival limit family size?,2017,"OBJECTIVE To present the experience with the extraperitoneal approach for robotic-assisted simple prostatectomy (RASP) in a technique replicating the vesicocapsular incision technique of open surgery. PATIENTS AND METHODS RASP was performed on patients with a prostate volume of >80 cm(3) with an indication for open enucleation of the prostate. Preoperatively, all patients were evaluated by uroflowmetry, prostate-specific antigen level, and postvoid residual measurement, as well as by the International Prostate Symptom Score questionnaire. All perioperative data were recorded in a prospective database. Follow-up appointments included the aforementioned measurements and were scheduled at 1 and 6 months postoperatively. RESULTS Ten RASP procedures were successfully performed by the extraperitoneal approach. Mean patient age and prostate volume were 63.1 years (range, 55-74 years) and 129.4 cm(3) (range, 90-170 cm(3)), respectively. Mean operative time was 122.5 minutes (range, 85-140 minutes) and represented the time from the first incision to the closure of the all incisions. The estimated blood loss was minimal (mean value, 230 mL). Transfusions were not necessary. Mean catheterization period was 7.4 days (range, 6-8 days). The symptomatology, as reported by the International Prostate Symptom Score, was improved at the follow-up appointments in comparison with the baseline values. One case of prolonged fever was noted postoperatively and managed by antibiotics. CONCLUSION The extraperitoneal approach for RASP proved to be efficient in the management of large prostates. The results are directly comparable with the current available experience with transperitoneal RASP. The extraperitoneal RASP seems to favorably compare with the open simple prostatectomy, while the results are at least comparable with those of conventional laparoscopic approach.","Stolzenburg, Jens-Uwe; Kallidonis, Panagiotis; Qazi, Hasan; Ho Thi, Phuc; Dietel, Anja; Liatsikos, Evangelos N; Do, Minh",Urology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.urology.2014.06.045; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25443912/,192

RECENT FINDINGS Multiple randomized trials recently assessed the clinical performance of novel very thin to ultrathin-strut DES. Most randomized trials established noninferiority of the novel device. To date, only one major randomized clinical trial (i.e., BIOFLOW V) showed superiority of an ultrathin-strut biodegradable polymer-coated sirolimus-eluting stent over a very thin-strut durable polymer-coated everolimus-eluting stent in a relatively broad patient population. There are signals that the same ultrathin-strut biodegradable polymer-coated sirolimus-eluting stent may improve clinical outcome in specific patient populations. For example, in the randomized BIOSTEMI trial, 1-year superiority of the ultrathin-strut DES was found in patients presenting with an acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. Yet, substudies of large randomized trials that assessed patients with small-vessel treatment showed equivocal results. SUMMARY Although two randomized trials showed advantages for ultrathin-strut DES, other clinical trials provided no significant evidence that ultrathin-strut DES improve clinical outcome. The question whether ultrathin-strut DES may reduce the repeat revascularization risk following implantation in small vessels is a matter of further debate and future research.","Buiten, Rosaly A; Zocca, Paolo; von Birgelen, Clemens",Current opinion in cardiology,https://doi.org/10.1097/hco.0000000000000786; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32852343/,192

STUDY DESIGN Diagnosis of MIS-C like disease was pursued after echocardiography showed severely depressed ventricular function and pathological coronary artery dilation in the setting of medically refractory multisystem organ failure and maternal COVID-19 infection. The neonate did not respond to standard medical therapy, and there was no alternative disease that could explain the clinical course. High index of clinical suspicion coupled with low risk of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) prompted us to pursue IVIG administration even though the neonate did not meet classic criteria for MIS-C. RESULT Following treatment with IVIG, there was rapid clinical improvement. Ventricular function improved within 15 hours and coronary artery dilation resolved in 8 days. There was no recurrence of disease during follow-up. CONCLUSION COVID-19 associated MIS-C like disease has not been well described in neonates. As typical features may be conspicuously absent, a high index of suspicion is warranted in critically ill neonates born to mothers with COVID-19. Echocardiography may provide critical diagnostic information and narrow the differential diagnosis.

We conducted searches in the following databases: Medline (PubMed), LILACS (BVS), SCOPUS (Elsevier), Embase (OVID), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Biomed Central, and ISI Web of Science, from January 1990 to October 2016. For inclusion, studies measured NGAL levels in plasma and urine for AKI in children. For each study, 2 × 2 contingency tables were developed. For statistical analysis we calculated the sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic odds ratio. For methodological assessment, we used Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2. Software used for analysis was Stata 14, and RevMan 5.3. RESULTS In total 13 studies were analyzed, which included 1629 children. For urinary NGAL, the pooled sensitivity was 0.76 (95% CI 0.62-0.85) and a pooled specificity 0.93 (95% CI 0.88-0.96). The diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) for the detection of AKI was 43 (95% CI 16-115) and the Area under the curve (AUC) was 0.94 (95% CI 0.92-0.96). For plasma NGAL the combined sensitivity was 0.80 (95% CI 0.64-0.90) and a combined specificity was 0.87 (95% CI 0.74-0.94). The DOR was 26 (95% CI 8.0-82) and AUC was 0.90 (95% CI 0.87-0.94) for the detection of AKI in children. CONCLUSION The data suggest that NGAL levels can be an important biomarker for the early detection of AKI in children.","Filho, Luís Taddeo; Grande, Antonio Jose; Colonetti, Tamy; Della, Éverton Simon Possamai; da Rosa, Maria Inês",Pediatric nephrology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00467-017-3704-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28616656/,192

Methods: Data came from 32,194 respondents to The Global Drug Survey (GDS) 2015, an annual, cross-sectional, online survey. Respondents selected their usual drinking location (home alone: home with partner/family: house parties: pubs/bars or clubs) and usual drink (wine; beer/cider/lager; spirits or alcopops/coolers). They indicated how many drinks they required to reach three stages of intoxication (feeling the effects; an ideal stage of intoxication; and the tipping point) and how frequently they reached each stage. Results: Drink type affected grams of alcohol reported to reach the tipping point: 109 gm wine, 127 gm alcopops, 133 gm of beer, and 134 gm of spirts. Respondents who drank at home alone, or in clubs reached their tipping point more frequently compared to other locations. Conclusions: Where people drink, and the type of alcohol they drink, affected the amount of alcohol reported to reach different stages of intoxication. Understanding why different drinking locations, and drink types lead to a need for greater consumption to reach an ideal state of drunkenness, such as social cues from other people who drink, may enable people to reduce their drinking.","Davies, Emma L; Cooke, Richard; Maier, Larissa J; Winstock, Adam R; Ferris, Jason A",Substance use & misuse,https://doi.org/10.1080/10826084.2021.1958864; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34378484/,192

BACKGROUND The prevalence of telework has increased due to COVID-19. The upsurge brings with it challenges, including limited face-to-face interaction with colleagues and supervisors, reduced access to ergonomics information and resources, increased social isolation, and blurred role definitions, which may adversely affect teleworker safety, health, and well-being. METHOD Evidence-based strategies for improving occupational safety, health, and well-being among teleworkers were synthesized in a narrative-based review to address common challenges associated with telework considering circumstances unique to the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS Interventions aimed at increasing worker motivation to engage in safe and healthy behaviors via enhanced safety leadership, managing role boundaries to reduce occupational safety and health risks, and redesigning work to strengthen interpersonal interactions, interdependence, as well as workers' initiation have been supported in the literature.

101719,Canaries in the mine.,2021-03-12,"Current retrospective data have found up to 20% of COVID-19 infection had developed into severe cases with hyperinflammatory pulmonary symptoms. Interleukin 6 (IL-6) is recognized as a key mediator of hyperinflammation previously mentioned in cytokine release syndrome. This leads to implementing IL-6 pathway inhibition in severe COVID-19. This review aimed to explore the clinical evidences of using IL-6 antagonists in COVID-19 infection based on most recent available data. Relevant studies were searched through PubMed, scopus, and ISI databases focusing on interleukin-6 antagonists in cytokine release syndrome and prospective data on COVID-19 infection. Only papers in English were included in the search. There were several studies conducted to evaluate the potential efficacy and safety of IL-6 antagonists and mostly with tocilizumab. After the search, we found that studies recruited patients with severe COVID-19 and elevated inflammatory mediators such as C-reactive protein (CRP), IL-6, or ferritin to receive tocilizumab, situximab or sarilumab in combination with other medications. Result showed that these agents may provide a clinical advantage as patients were able to refrain from invasive ventilation support after initiating IL-6 antagonists. In summary, IL-6 pathway inhibition in severe COVID-19 may be an emerging candidate to subside pulmonary complication. These agents may carry benefits in COVID-19 infection as well as safety risks such as bone marrow suppression. Current pharmacists' role is to provide most recent update information as well as intensive monitoring plan in patients who receive IL-6 inhibitor. However, robust clinical evidences are warranted to confirm efficacy and safety of IL-6 antagonists.","Meanwatthana, Jennis; Majam, Teerapat",Journal of pharmacy practice,https://doi.org/10.1177/08971900211000691; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33759631/,192
102048,"From mice to monkeys, animals studied for coronavirus answers.",2020-04-17,"Background: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacterium, produces pyocyanin, a virulence factor associated with antibiotic tolerance. High concentrations of royal jelly have an antibacterial effect, which may potentially overcome antibacterial resistance. However, in some cases, antibiotic tolerance can occur due to prolonged stress of low-dose antibacterial agents. This study aimed to investigate the effect of subinhibitory concentrations of royal jelly on bacterial growth, pyocyanin production, and biofilm formation of P. aeruginosa. Methods: Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 10145 and clinical isolates were cultured in a royal jelly-containing medium to test the antibacterial activity. Pyocyanin production was observed by measuring the absorbance at 690 nm after 36 h culture and determined using extinction coefficient 4310 M-1 cm-1. Static microtiter plate biofilm assay performed to detect the biofilm formation, followed by scanning electron microscopy. Results: Royal jelly effectively inhibited the viability of both strains from a concentration of 25%. The highest production of pyocyanin was observed in the subinhibitory concentration group 6.25%, which gradually decreased along with the decrease of royal jelly concentration. Results of one-way ANOVA tests differed significantly in pyocyanin production of the two strains between the royal jelly groups. Tukey HSD test showed concentrations of 12.5%, 6.25%, and 3.125% significantly increased pyocyanin production of ATCC 10145, and the concentrations of 12.5% and 6.25% significantly increased production of the clinical isolates. Concentrations of 12.5% and 6.125% significantly induced biofilm formation of P. aeruginosa ATCC 10145, in line with the results of the SEM analysis. Conclusions: Royal jelly concentrations of 25% or higher can inhibit bacterial growth; however, subinhibitory concentrations could increase pyocyanin production and biofilm formation in P. aeruginosa. It is advisable to determine the appropriate concentration of royal jelly to obtain beneficial virulence inhibiting activity.","Amly, Dina Auliya; Hajardhini, Puspita; Jonarta, Alma Linggar; Yulianto, Heribertus Dedy Kusuma; Susilowati, Heni",F1000Research,https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.27915.2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34540201/,192

DESIGN Prospective and noncomparative study (Canadian Task Force classification II-3). SETTING University hospital. PATIENTS Nineteen consecutive patients with symptomatic uterine myomas desiring conservative minimally invasive robotic surgery from October 2015 to December 2016. INTERVENTIONS An 8.5-mm or 12-mm robotic camera cannula was inserted through 1 of the Octo-Port channels and an 8-mm conventional robotic port was inserted into a 10-mm channel of the Octo-Port through a 3-cm transumbilical incision. An additional 8-mm conventional robotic port was inserted into a typical robotic port site in the patient's right abdomen. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Feasibility and operative outcomes of RPRS myomectomy. The median docking time and console time were 10 minutes (range, 4-22) and 90 minutes (range, 29-198). The largest myoma was located on the anterior uterine wall in 11 patients (57.9%). The median myoma size and weight were 7.2 cm (range, 4.1-10.5) and 141 g (range, 42-590), respectively. Median operative blood loss and change in hemoglobin were 100 mL (range, 30-700) and 2.6 mg/dL (range, .1-3.8), respectively.

Also, to detect any change it the phonatory patterns while speaking with face mask. METHODS This was a cross-sectional, observational study, conducted by distributing an online questionnaire. From a total of 155 people who participated in the study, 143 of them wore protective face mask during their working hours and qualified. Five groups of questions were used to measure the Speech Difficulties, the Mask Related Behaviors caused by the use of face mask, alterations in the Voice Perceptual Features, the Vocal Tract Discomfort levels and the Greek version of the Voice Handicap Index. The participants self-evaluated their voice and stated the frequency and severity of the symptoms they experienced during the mask usage period. RESULTS The results showed that the use of protective face mask increases the self-perception of changes in the voice, especially in the voice-breathing coordination and has great effect on the intelligibility and overall communication. The majority of people stated that they have to speak louder and that they have noticed alterations in the perceptual features of their voice, with hoarseness, and volume being the most frequently affected. Almost every symptom on the Vocal Tract Discomfort Group was present with Dry, Lump in Throat, Tight, and Short Breath being the most severe, and Dry and Short breath being the most common among them. Physical, Functional, and Emotional affectations were also observed through the Voice Handicap Index. CONCLUSION The use of protective face mask increases the vocal effort of the speaker, affects the voice-breathing coordination, limits the overall communication, alters the perceptual features of the voice, increases vocal track discomfort levels and results in psychosocial and socioemotional difficulties. All these affectations may result to the establishment of a voice disorder, especially in high-risk population.","Karagkouni, Olympia",Journal of voice : official journal of the Voice Foundation,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvoice.2021.04.014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34167856/,192
102957,New technologies for reporting real-time emergent infections.,2012,"INTRODUCTION SARS-CoV-2 is a novel virus that causes coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). Antiviral and immunomodulatory agents have been proposed as potential treatments. Azithromycin exhibits both properties and therefore may play a role. AREAS COVERED This article reviews the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, and safety of azithromycin in viral infections, with emphasis on COVID-19. A literature search of PUBMED was conducted on May 30th and updated on July 28th. EXPERT OPINION Azithromycin presents in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2 and could act in different points of the viral cycle. Its immunomodulatory properties include the ability to downregulate cytokine production, maintain epithelial cell integrity or prevent lung fibrosis. In other settings, azithromycin use was associated with a reduction in mortality and ventilation-days. These properties could be beneficial throughout the course of COVID-19. However, the evidence of its use is still scarce and of low quality. Azithromycin has been assessed in retrospective observational studies mainly in combination with hydroxychloroquine, which has shown to provide no benefit. Azithromycin exhibits a well-known safety profile. The stage of the disease where it offers the greatest benefits and the effect of its combination with other drugs are important questions that need to be addressed in the upcoming clinical trials.","Echeverría-Esnal, Daniel; Martin-Ontiyuelo, Clara; Navarrete-Rouco, María Eugenia; De-Antonio Cuscó, Marta; Ferrández, Olivia; Horcajada, Juan Pablo; Grau, Santiago",Expert review of anti-infective therapy,https://doi.org/10.1080/14787210.2020.1813024; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32853038/,192

Brazilian CHWs are overwhelmingly women from poor backgrounds, with precarious and sometimes hazardous working conditions, as well as fragmented and unsystematic training. This paper evaluates how the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated pre-existing vulnerabilities of CHWs (pertaining to low salary, precarious and hazardous working conditions and inadequate training) and created new ones, with a profound impact on their ability to carry out health promotion activities. Drawing on testimonials of dozens of CHWs and online discussions promoted by their unions, the paper reveals that during the pandemic CHWs were asked to continue their work without adequate training and protective equipment, thus exposing themselves to the risk of infection. It further shows how the pandemic rendered dangerous the close interaction with patients that is at the heart of their health promotion role. Nonetheless, CHWs sought to adapt their work. In the absence of leadership and coordination on the part of the federal government, CHWs mobilized different forms of resistance at the national and individual levels. Despite this, COVID-19 contributed to a trajectory of erosion of health promotion in Brazil. Findings from this case signal the difficulties for health promotion in low- and middle-income countries relying on CHWs to bridge the health system and vulnerable users.","Lotta, Gabriela; Nunes, João",Global health promotion,https://doi.org/10.1177/17579759211012375; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34112004/,192

Measures have ranged from quarantines when entering a country to outright travel bans. Yet more widespread travel restrictions in the form of country vaccine entry requirements have been in place for a long time for another disease - yellow fever. We track the historical underpinnings and policy developments that have led to stringent vaccine entry requirements today. We also discuss the political issues raised by health measures imposed on borders and discuss the reasons behind some clear regional differences. Almost no European countries currently have vaccine entry requirements, while at the other end of the spectrum, the majority of countries in the African region do, making vaccine entry requirements a global south phenomenon. We argue that vaccine entry requirements should be reassessed in the future as an underused public health tool, likely to become increasingly common. Vaccine entry requirements have proved effective in controlling the international spread of yellow fever but more can be done to ensure better use of this measure. Caution is needed due to the close links between public health and politics, evident since the first travel restriction in quarantines.","Vanderslott, Samantha; Marks, Tatjana",Global public health,https://doi.org/10.1080/17441692.2020.1805786; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32772788/,192

Similarly, an effective vaccine against HIV-1 will likely need to induce antibodies that prevent initial infection of host cells or that limit early events of viral dissemination. Such antibodies must target the surface envelope glycoproteins of HIV-1, which are highly variable in sequence and structure. The first subunit vaccines to enter clinical trails were safe and immunogenic but unable to elicit antibodies that neutralized most circulating strains of HIV-1. However, potent virus neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) can develop during the course of HIV-1 infection, and this is the type of antibody response that researchers seek to generate with a vaccine. Thus, current vaccine design efforts have focused on a more detailed understanding of these broadly neutralizing antibodies and their epitopes to inform the design of improved vaccines.","Mascola, John R; Montefiori, David C",Annual review of immunology,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-immunol-030409-101256; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20192810/,192

This mutation was first detected in clinical samples in Europe during the 2007-2008 influenza season. Viruses with this mutation reached a prevalence of ∼11% by the end of the season in North American isolates tested by the CDC. We developed a highly sensitive and specific quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase PCR assay to detect the H274Y mutation. This assay utilizes a 5'-methyl-isocytosine (isoC) residue and fluorescent reporters on genotype-specific primers. During PCR, a quencher coupled to isoguanine (isoG) is site-specifically incorporated complementary to the isoC/dye, resulting in loss of fluorescence. Optimization of primers and assay conditions produced a limit of detection of 100 gene copies per reaction for both wild-type and H274Y genotypes. In samples with mixed populations, it can reliably detect as little as a 1% wild-type or 0.1% H274Y component. This high sensitivity makes the assay usable on samples with viral loads too low for dideoxy or pyrosequencing analysis. Additionally, the assay distinguishes seasonal A/H1N1 from A/H3N2, influenza B, or 2009 pandemic A/H1N1, making it useful for influenza virus subtyping as well as for drug resistance detection. We probed seasonal A/H1N1 samples from the 2005-2006, 2006-2007, and 2007-2008 influenza seasons. Data from the new assay closely matched available drug resistance genotype data previously determined by dideoxy sequencing. The H274Y mutation was only found in samples from the 2007-2008 season.","Operario, Darwin J; Moser, Michael J; St George, Kirsten",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.01031-10; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20668122/,192

It has been estimated that older subjects spend approximately 19 to 20 h/d indoors. Older individuals may be particularly at risk for detrimental effects from pollutants, even at low concentrations, due to reduced immunological defenses and multiple underlying chronic diseases. Six Porto, Portugal, urban area elderly care centers (ECC), housing a total of 425 older persons, were studied to assess indoor air quality (IAQ) and thermal comfort (TC) in two seasons. This study presents the IAQ and TC results in 36 rooms and constitutes part of a wider and ongoing study. The study areas were all naturally ventilated, and indoor concentrations in winter were within Portuguese reference values. However, 42% of the participants were dissatisfied with indoor thermal conditions, rating it ""slightly cool."" In summer, the index rate of dissatisfied individuals was lower (8%). Significant differences were found between seasons in predicted percent of dissatisfied people (PPD) and predicted mean vote (PMV) indices. Fungal concentrations frequently exceeded reference levels (>500 colony-forming units [CFU]/m(3)). In addition, other pollutants occasionally exceeded reference levels. To our knowledge, this is the first study in Portugal to assess effects of indoor air contaminants on the health status and quality of life in older subjects living in ECC. Although IAQ and TC parameters were mostly within reference values, the results suggest a need to improve the balance between IAQ and TC in ECC, a critical environment housing a susceptible population.","Mendes, Ana; Pereira, Cristiana; Mendes, Diana; Aguiar, Lívia; Neves, Paula; Silva, Susana; Batterman, Stuart; Teixeira, João Paulo",Journal of toxicology and environmental health.

RECENT FINDINGS The most recent guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of Lyme disease were published in 2020 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the American Academy of Neurology, and the American College of Rheumatology. SUMMARY The most common neurologic complications of Lyme disease are cranial neuritis (most often a unilateral or bilateral facial nerve palsy), meningitis, and radiculoneuritis/mononeuropathy multiplex. Testing for Lyme disease begins with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). If the ELISA is positive or borderline, Western blots should be performed for both IgM and IgG antibodies. As a general rule, in infectious diseases, an IgM antibody response is followed by an IgG antibody response. A central nervous system infection has either a CSF pleocytosis or pathogen-specific intrathecal antibody production. Lyme meningitis, cranial neuropathy, radiculoneuropathy, or other peripheral nervous system manifestations are treated with oral doxycycline or IV ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, or penicillin G. No additional antibiotic therapy is indicated for patients with posttreatment Lyme disease syndrome or patients with concern for chronic Lyme disease with no evidence of previous or current Lyme infection.","Roos, Karen L",Continuum,https://doi.org/10.1212/con.0000000000001015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34623103/,192

We also evaluated their antibacterial and immunoenhancing effects using RAW 264.7 macrophage cells. The major metabolites in BV are organic acids, with the main volatile compounds being ethyl acetate, isoamyl acetate, 1-pentanol, hydroxypropanoic acid, and malonic acid. When we fermented BV from unpeeled roots for 10 days with a starter culture, we observed significant antibacterial and immunoenhancing effects in macrophages. Therefore, we could determine the metabolite and functional differences in vinegar obtained from bellflower roots and proposed that bellflower roots with peel are an effective substrate for developing vinegar and healthy food products.","Gil, Na-Young; Gwon, Hee-Min; Yeo, Soo-Hwan; Kim, So-Young",Foods,https://doi.org/10.3390/foods9081063; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764333/,192

To investigate how CRs about e-cigarettes may affect intentions to engage in healthy behaviors, 717 former and current smokers were randomly exposed to one of five conditions (varying in the level of conflict in recommendations) in this between-subject experiment. Our results indicated a significant interaction between the message level of conflict and individuals' information avoidance, employed to maintain hope and deniability. These results suggest the effects of CRs stemming from scientific uncertainty vary with subgroups of people, pointing to several pressing theoretical and practical implications.","Yang, Qinghua; Herbert, Natalie; Yang, Sijia; Alber, Julia; Ophir, Yotam; Cappella, Joseph N",Communication monographs,https://doi.org/10.1080/03637751.2020.1809685; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34483460/,192

It is frequently related to trauma and idiopathic causes, and the pain is mostly chronic in character. Percutaneous vertebroplasty and sacroplasty are the methods widely used in treating compression fractures and deficiency of vertebral body and sacrum. However, the efficiency of polymethylmethacrylate injection in the treatment of osteoporotic coccyx fractures and coccydynia is still unknown. Case Report A 68-year-old man admitted to our clinic with complaints of pain in the sacrococcygeal and perianal regions. In the imaging studies, a fracture line in 5th sacral and 1st coccygeal segments, as well as oedema in the bone structure was observed. Since the patient's pain did not improve with conservative methods, we treated our patient with coccygeoplasty. Conclusion In this report, we have presented a case with osteoporotic coccyx fracture treated through coccygeoplasty. We recommend coccygeoplasty in the treatment of acute or subacute osteoporotic coccygeal fractures and coccydynia with oedema.","Akar, Ezgi; Koban, Orkun; Öğrenci, Ahmet; Yılmaz, Mesut; Dalbayrak, Sedat",Balkan medical journal,https://doi.org/10.4274/balkanmedj.galenos.2020.2020.4.68; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32573177/,192

The consequences of these difficulties are likely to be longstanding, in part because of the ways in which contextual risk permeates the structures and processes of family systems. The current article draws from pertinent literature across topic areas of acute crises and long-term, cumulative risk to illustrate the multitude of ways in which the well-being of children and families may be at risk during COVID-19. The presented conceptual framework is based on systemic models of human development and family functioning and links social disruption due to COVID-19 to child adjustment through a cascading process involving caregiver well-being and family processes (i.e., organization, communication, and beliefs). An illustration of the centrality of family processes in buffering against risk in the context of COVID-19, as well as promoting resilience through shared family beliefs and close relationships, is provided.

Like other specialties, neuroanesthesiology has been adversely affected and training programs have had to quickly adapt to the constantly changing environment. METHODS An email-based survey was used to evaluate the effects of the pandemic on clinical workflow, clinical training, education, and trainee well-being. The impact of the International Council on Perioperative Neuroscience Training (ICPNT) accreditation was also assessed. RESULTS Responses were received from 14 program directors (88% response rate) in 10 countries and from 36 fellows in these programs. Clinical training was adversely affected because of the cancellation of elective neurosurgery and other changes in case workflow, the introduction of modified airway and other protocols, and redeployment of trainees to other sites. To address educational demands, most programs utilized online platforms to organize clinical discussions, journal clubs, and provide safety training modules. Several initiatives were introduced to support trainee well-being during the pandemic. Feelings of isolation and despair among trainees varied from 2 to 8 (on a scale of 1 to 10). Fellows all reported concerns that their clinical training had been adversely affected by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic because of decreased exposure to elective subspecialty cases and limited opportunities to complete workplace-based assessments and training portfolio requirements. Cancellation of examination preparation courses and delayed examinations were cited as common sources of stress. Programs accredited by the ICPNT reported that international networking and collaboration was beneficial to reduce feelings of isolation during the pandemic. CONCLUSION Neuroanesthesia fellowship training program directors introduced innovative ways to maintain clinical training, educational activity and trainee well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Rajan, Shobana; Bebawy, John; Avitsian, Rafi; Lee, Chanhung Z; Rath, Girija; Luoma, Astri; Bilotta, Federico; Pierce, John T; Kofke, William A",Journal of neurosurgical anesthesiology,https://doi.org/10.1097/ana.0000000000000738; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33075035/,192

As inferred from studies comparing vaccinated and experimentally infected mice, the acquired immune response elicited by this pathogen fails to efficiently clear the virus from the airways, which leads to an exaggerated inflammatory response and lung damage. Furthermore, after disease resolution, there is a poor development of T and B cell immunological memory, which is believed to promote reinfections and viral spread in the community. In this article, we discuss the molecular mechanisms that shape the interactions of HMPV with host tissues that lead to pulmonary pathology and to the development of adaptive immunity that fails to protect against natural infections by this virus.","Céspedes, Pablo F; Palavecino, Christian E; Kalergis, Alexis M; Bueno, Susan M",Clinical microbiology reviews,https://doi.org/10.1128/cmr.00081-15; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27413096/,192

Examination of small and large intestinal contents revealed cestodes in 79% and nematodes in 75% of the chickens. Although ectoparasites and endoparasites were common (74% and 79%, respectively), only a few chickens had lesions at postmortem examination, mainly intestinal serosal nodules (12%) and feather loss (6%). Histologic examination of 18 organs from each bird revealed lesions in high percentages of organs, mainly the liver (86%), lung (75%), spleen (60%), small intestine (56%), skin (42%), and kidney (40%). Lesions included degenerative, reactive, inflammatory, and neoplastic, and were not correlated with the serologic status of the chickens except in one case of infectious bursal disease. Microscopically, Paratanaisia bragai was seen in the kidneys of 3 chickens and intestinal coccidiasis in 1 chicken. Pulmonary silicate aggregates were common, were present in intestinal serosal nodules, and were suggestive of environmental exposure.","Bolfa, Pompei; Callanan, John J; Ketzis, Jenifer; Marchi, Silvia; Cheng, Trista; Huynh, Hieuhanh; Lavinder, Tiffany; Boey, Kenneth; Hamilton, Clare; Kelly, Patrick","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",https://doi.org/10.1177/1040638719843638; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30973088/,192

OBJECTIVES Our aim was to compare cerebral and renal tissue oxygen saturation (rSO2) between infants with LSOL with antegrade and retrograde blood flow in the ascending aorta and with and without diastolic backflow in the descending aorta. METHODS Based on 2 echocardiograms, the study group was categorized according to the direction of blood flow in the ascending and descending aorta. We measured cerebral and renal rSO2 using near-infrared spectroscopy and calculated fractional tissue oxygen extraction (FTOE). RESULTS Nineteen infants with LSOL, admitted to the NICU between 0 and 28 days after birth, were included. Infants with antegrade blood flow (n = 12) and infants with retrograde blood flow in the ascending aorta (n = 7) had similar cerebral rSO2 and FTOE during both echocardiograms. Only during the first echocardiogram, infants with retrograde blood flow in the ascending aorta had lower renal FTOE (0.14 vs. 0.32, p = 0.04) and tended to have higher renal rSO2 (80 vs. 65%, p = 0.09). The presence of diastolic backflow in the descending aorta was not associated with cerebral or renal rSO2 and FTOE during the first (n = 8) as well as the second echocardiogram (n = 10). CONCLUSIONS Retrograde blood flow in the ascending aorta was not associated with cerebral oxygenation, while diastolic backflow in the descending aorta was not associated with renal oxygenation in infants with LSOL.","van der Laan, Michelle E; Mebius, Mirthe J; Roofthooft, Marcus T R; Bos, Arend F; Berger, Rolf M F; Kooi, Elisabeth M W",Neonatology,https://doi.org/10.1159/000473870; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28704832/,192
108833,Intraovarian WNT3A modulates estrogen-mediated estrus behavior in cattle.,2018-09-01,"The exploitation of high-efficient and cheap bifunctional cathode electrocatalyst is of significant importance to rechargeable zinc-air battery. In this paper, bimetallic sulfide coupled with CNTs ((Co, Mg)S2@CNTs) hybrid catalyst is developed via a proposed vulcanization process. The (Co, Mg)S2@CNTs) with controllable Mg substitution has a tailored crystal structure (amorphous and crystalline), which catalyzes oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/ OER), respectively. The active sites of CoS2@CNTs are activated by doping Mg ions, which accelerates the kinetics of the oxygen adsorption for ORR and oxygen desorption for OER. Meanwhile, the hybrid catalyst exhibits a unique hierarchal morphology and ""catalytic buffer"", which further accelerate the mass transfer of catalytic processes. In addition, the outer wall of CNTs as substrate effectively avoids the agglomeration of (Co, Mg)S2 particles by reasonably providing adsorption sites. The inter and outer walls of CNTs forms a high-speed conduction pathway, quickly transferring the electrons produced by oxygen catalytic reactions. As a result, the (Co, Mg)S2@CNTs exhibits an ORR performance comparable with commercial catalyst Pt/C-RuO2 and remarkable OER performance (Ej=10=1.59V). The high power density of 268 mW cm-2 and long-term charge/discharge-stability of the zinc-air battery proves the feasibility of (Co, Mg)S2@CNTs application in high power devices.","Guo, Jianing; Xu, Nengneng; Wang, Yongxia; Wang, Xu; Huang, Haitao; Qiao, Jinli",ACS applied materials & interfaces,https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c09385; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32667803/,192

In this population, influenza virus can replicate for prolonged periods, despite neuraminidase inhibitor treatment, leading to resistance and treatment failure. Baloxavir targets the influenza polymerase and may be an effective treatment option in these patients. METHODS We used baloxavir to treat five allogeneic SCT recipients that were still symptomatic and shedding influenza virus after completing one or more treatment courses of oseltamivir and characterized the viral isolates before and during treatment. RESULTS Two patients were infected with influenza A/H1pdm09 carrying a neuraminidase variant (H275Y) linked to oseltamivir resistance. Both these two patients were successfully treated with baloxavir. Of the 3 patients infected with wild-type influenza virus, two cleared the virus after baloxavir treatment, while the third patient developed the polymerase I38T variant linked to baloxavir resistance. CONCLUSIONS Our data suggest that baloxavir treatment can be effective in treating neuraminidase inhibitor resistant influenza in profoundly immunocompromised patients. Randomized clinical trials are needed to define the role of baloxavir alone and combined with oseltamivir for treatment of influenza in SCT recipients and other immunocompromised populations.","Salvatore, Mirella; Laplante, Jennifer M; Soave, Rosemary; Orfali, Nina; Plate, Markus; van Besien, Koen; St George, Kirsten",Transplant infectious disease : an official journal of the Transplantation Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/tid.13336; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32449254/,192

However, systematic tracking of a lncRNA signature for prognosis prediction in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has not been accomplished yet. Here, comprehensive analysis with differential gene expression analysis, univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database was performed to identify the lncRNA signature for prediction of the overall survival of NSCLC patients. A risk-score model based on a 14-lncRNA signature was identified, which could classify patients into high-risk and low-risk groups and show poor and improved outcomes, respectively. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve revealed that the risk-score model has good performance with high AUC value. Multivariate Cox's regression model and stratified analysis indicated that the risk-score was independent of other clinicopathological prognostic factors. Furthermore, the risk-score model was competent for the prediction of metastasis-free survival in NSCLC patients. Moreover, the risk-score model was applicable for prediction of the overall survival in the other 30 caner types of TCGA.

Previous research linked increased susceptibility to collapsing glomerulopathy, including in patients with HIV-associated nephropathy, to apo L1 (APOL1) variants that are more common in those of African descent. METHODS To investigate genetic, histopathologic, and molecular features in six black patients with COVID-19 presenting with AKI and de novo nephrotic-range proteinuria, we obtained biopsied kidney tissue, which was examined by in situ hybridization for viral detection and by NanoString for COVID-19 and acute tubular injury-associated genes. We also collected peripheral blood for APOL1 genotyping. RESULTS This case series included six black patients with COVID-19 (four men, two women), mean age 55 years. At biopsy day, mean serum creatinine was 6.5 mg/dl and mean urine protein-creatinine ratio was 11.5 g. Kidney biopsy specimens showed collapsing glomerulopathy, extensive foot process effacement, and focal/diffuse acute tubular injury. Three patients had endothelial reticular aggregates. We found no evidence of viral particles or SARS-CoV-2 RNA. NanoString showed elevated chemokine gene expression and changes in expression of genes associated with acute tubular injury compared with controls. All six patients had an APOL1 high-risk genotype. Five patients needed dialysis (two of whom died); one partially recovered without dialysis. CONCLUSIONS Collapsing glomerulopathy in black patients with COVID-19 was associated with high-risk APOL1 variants. We found no direct viral infection in the kidneys, suggesting a possible alternative mechanism: a ""two-hit"" combination of genetic predisposition and cytokine-mediated host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

112399,Tough adhesives for diverse wet surfaces.,2017,"In seasonally breeding vertebrates, hormones coordinate changes in nervous system structure and function to facilitate reproductive readiness and success. Steroid hormones often exert their effects indirectly via regulation of neuromodulators, which in turn can coordinate the modulation of sensory input with appropriate motor output. Female plainfin midshipman fish (Porichthys notatus) undergo increased peripheral auditory sensitivity in time for the summer breeding season, improving their ability to detect mates, which is regulated by steroid hormones. Reproductive females also show differences in catecholaminergic innervation of auditory circuitry compared to winter, non-reproductive females as measured by tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the rate-limiting enzyme in catecholaminergic synthesis. Importantly, catecholaminergic input to the inner ear from a dopaminergic-specific forebrain nucleus is decreased in the summer and dopamine inhibits the sensitivity of the inner ear, suggesting that gonadal steroids may alter auditory sensitivity by regulating dopamine innervation. In this study, we gonadectomized non-reproductive females, implanted them with estradiol (E2) or testosterone (T), and measured TH immunoreactive (-ir) fibers in auditory nuclei where catecholaminergic innervation was previously shown to be seasonally plastic. We found that treatment with T, but not E2, reduced TH-ir innervation in the auditory hindbrain. T-treatment also reduced TH-ir fiber density in the forebrain dopaminergic cell group that projects to the inner ear, and likely to the auditory hindbrain. Higher T plasma in the treatment group was correlated with reduced-ir TH terminals in the inner ear. These T-treatment induced changes in TH-ir fibers mimic the seasonal downregulation of dopamine in the midshipman inner ear and provide evidence that steroid hormone regulation of peripheral auditory sensitivity is mediated by dopamine.","Perelmuter, Jonathan T; Hom, Kelsey N; Mohr, Rob A; Demis, Lina; Kim, Spencer; Chernenko, Alena; Timothy, Miky; Middleton, Mollie A; Sisneros, Joseph A; Forlano, Paul M",Integrative and comparative biology,https://doi.org/10.1093/icb/icab070; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33974077/,192

BACKGROUND Absolute quantification of myocardial perfusion and MPR with PET have proven diagnostic and prognostic roles in patients with CAD. Quantitative CMR perfusion imaging has been established more recently and has been validated against PET in normal hearts. However, there are no studies comparing fully quantitative CMR against PET perfusion imaging in patients with CAD. METHODS Forty-one patients with known or suspected CAD prospectively underwent quantitative (13)N-ammonia PET and CMR perfusion imaging before coronary angiography. RESULTS The CMR-derived MPR (MPR(CMR)) correlated well with PET-derived measurements (MPR(PET)) (r = 0.75, p < 0.0001). MPR(CMR) and MPR(PET) for the 2 lowest scoring segments in each coronary territory also correlated strongly (r = 0.79, p < 0.0001). Absolute CMR perfusion values correlated significantly, but weakly, with PET values both at rest (r = 0.32; p = 0.002) and during stress (r = 0.37; p < 0.0001). Area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve for MPR(PET) to detect significant CAD was 0.83 (95% confidence interval: 0.73 to 0.94) and for MPR(CMR) was 0.83 (95% confidence interval: 0.74 to 0.92). An MPR(PET) ≤1.44 predicted significant CAD with 82% sensitivity and 87% specificity, and MPR(CMR) ≤1.45 predicted significant CAD with 82% sensitivity and 81% specificity. CONCLUSIONS There is good correlation between MPR(CMR) and MPR(PET.) For the detection of significant CAD, MPR(PET) and MPR(CMR) seem comparable and very accurate. However, absolute perfusion values from PET and CMR are only weakly correlated; therefore, although quantitative CMR is clinically useful, further refinements are still required.","Morton, Geraint; Chiribiri, Amedeo; Ishida, Masaki; Hussain, Shazia T; Schuster, Andreas; Indermuehle, Andreas; Perera, Divaka; Knuuti, Juhani; Baker, Stacey; Hedström, Erik; Schleyer, Paul; O'Doherty, Michael; Barrington, Sally; Nagel, Eike",Journal of the American College of Cardiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacc.2012.05.052; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22999722/,192

Since then, many vaccines were rushed into testing, bypassing animal experimentations, with more than 200 pharma companies in different countries declaring the development of different vaccines, each with their own strategy for generating immunity, despite the arguments of many infectious disease experts that 18 months for a first vaccine is an incredibly aggressive schedule because it takes an average of 10 years to develop a vaccine. Ten vaccine candidates have already entered phase 3 clinical trials in humans. These vaccines rely on different types of technology, the most innovative of which use the genetic material messenger RNA. Many provocative questions and genuine concerns have been raised, such as short durations of efficacy and safety follow-ups, lack of identified correlates of protection, morbidity and mortality cases reported shortly after vaccination, uncertainties regarding the risk of enhanced disease on exposure to the virus in the long-term, the possibility of viral transmission after vaccination, the reported reduced efficacies of these vaccines against new variants, the efficacy and safety of these vaccines in the previously excluded subgroups (such as children, pregnant women, the frail elderly high-risk population, and immunocompromised individuals), the unknown risk of immunogenicity-induced autoimmune diseases, cancer and chronic inflammation, the risk of genome transformation (mainly in the presence of reverse transcriptase), and finally the potential coercion that may be imposed by either public or private sectors on citizens to receive the vaccine.

Medical educators needed to flexibly and quickly cater learning to the evolving landscape.A three-hour teaching session was devised to be delivered to 50 students online via Microsoft Teams™ and facilitated by five general practice tutors in groups of 10, prior to students' GP placements. In pre-assigned pairs, students undertook two role-play scenarios for the main remote modalities of telephone and video-consultations. E-consultations were explored via discussion of simulated encounters. The authentic technology pertinent to each modality was used; this included a training version of NHS Scotland's Near Me IT platform for video-consultations, the students' own mobile phones for telephone consultations and simulated PDFs generated using the e-consultation facility. Teaching was evaluated via a student focus group pre and post placement.Student feedback was positive. The session prepared them for their placement and increased their confidence. They suggested this teaching be incorporated earlier in the medical school curriculum. They appreciated learning with the same IT platforms used on placement. Some students had no prior experience of remote consultations and subsequently were expected to undertake independent remote consultations almost immediately upon arrival.Careful design of challenging scenarios mirroring common GP presentations via remote modalities can increase student preparedness and confidence prior to GP placements during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Cannon, Philip; Lumsden, Linzi; Wass, Valerie","Education for primary care : an official publication of the Association of Course Organisers, National Association of GP Tutors, World Organisation of Family Doctors",https://doi.org/10.1080/14739879.2021.1920476; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33913401/,192

The aim of the study was to assess how the tree species of urban agglomerations affect soil quality and enzymatic activity (dehydrogenases DEH, catalase CAT, alkaline AlP and acid AcP phosphatase, protease PR, β-glucosidase GLU, and urease UR). To this end, soil samples were taken from beneath nine park trees. The risk of soil contamination by selected heavy metals (Pb, Ni, Cd) was also investigated against the background of the selected physicochemical properties. Enzyme activity results were used to calculate multi-parametric indices of soil quality: availability factor (AF), enzymatic pH indicator (AlP/AcP), biological index of fertility (BIF), geometric mean (GMea), alternation index (Al3), biochemical soil activity (BA16 and BA17). The results showed statistically significant differences in physicochemical and enzymatic properties of soil depending on tree species. Correlation analysis showed that the content of total organic carbon (TOC), total nirogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP) and humus (OM) in soil significantly influenced the activity of the studied enzymes and glomalin content. AF coefficient values (1.84%-18.19%) suggest that the bioavailability of available phosphorus (AP) was sufficient. The Pb, Ni, Cd content results were found to be low and did not exceed the permissible concentrations. DEH, CAT and AlP activity were highest under common hawthorn, and AcP, GLU and PR under northern white cedar. The calculated enzymatic indicators proved to be a sensitive and accurate indicator of the dynamics of changes taking place in the city park soil.

The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with a first-available vancomycin serum concentration between 20-25 mg/L at 24 h (D2) or 48 h (D3). Of 3894 admitted ICU patients, 179 were included. A median loading dose of 15.6 (interquartile range (IQR) = (12.5-20.8) mg/kg) was given in 151/179 patients (84%). The median daily doses of vancomycin infusion for D1 and D2 were 2000 [(IQR (1600-2000)) and 2000 (IQR (2000-2500)) mg/d], respectively. The median duration of treatment was 4 (2-7) days.

The method has been denominated by some authors as ""scarless."" We report one of the initial clinical experiences in Europe with this new technique. METHODS Fourteen patients underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy using the ASC TriPort. In all cases, a small transumbilical incision was used to insert two 5-mm rigid laparoscopic instruments and a 5-mm 30 degrees telescope via the Triport. Hemostasis control was obtained by using an ultrasonic cutting device (SonoSurg, Olympus), Endo Clips (Covidien), and Lapro-Clips (Covidien). RESULTS All cases were completed successfully. There were no perioperative port-related or surgical complications. No extra skin incisions were needed. Operative time was longer than in common laparoscopic cholecystectomy. CONCLUSIONS Transumbilical single-port access cholecystectomy (SPACE) is a feasible technique for operating with less scars and reducing postoperative discomfort at the same time. The transumbilical single-port access for laparoscopic cholecystectomy has multiple benefits, such as better cosmetic results, less wound infections, and less incisional hernias. That is why SPACE is even more appropriate for obese patients. Using one-hand specialized instruments, which are curved at the shaft, and a semiflexible laparoscopic camera (LTFVH, Olympus) will make SPACE more comfortable and more time-saving.","Langwieler, Thomas E; Nimmesgern, Thomas; Back, Melanie",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-009-0389-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19263120/,192

The present study reports for the first time the levels of 7 polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) congeners, and 18 trace elements measured in dust samples collected in 68 households from Zagreb, Croatia. Based on the obtained data from dust analysis and the questionnaire on the house characteristics and habits of the residents, we aimed to assess the possible indoor sources of PBDEs/elements, and the associated health risks. Mass concentrations of ΣPBDE ranged from 0.16 and 200.09 ng g-1 dust (median 4.19 ng g-1 dust). The most frequently detected congeners were BDE-99 and BDE-183 found in >88% of samples, while for trace elements, Al, Fe, Zn, Mn and Cu were found at the highest concentrations (enumerated in the descending order). The regression analysis indicated that renovation, number of residents and hours spent using electronic devices are significant predictors for determining PBDE dust concentrations, while the house age, and the house area were identified as the most important contributors for most trace elements. Our health risk assessment considering dust ingestion and dermal absorption of analyzed dust indicated that no adverse health effects are expected in toddlers and adults from exposure to PBDEs or trace elements in house dust. However, calculating the worst case exposure scenario based on the maximum measured concentrations and high dust intake rates, it was estimated that there is a risk of potential adverse health effects for Co (HI > 1). Even though the cases of high exposure to toxic elements from dust are sporadic, and not common among the general population, this exposure scenario should be included whenever assessing the background exposure of children.","Klinčić, Darija; Tariba Lovaković, Blanka; Jagić, Karla; Dvoršćak, Marija",The Science of the total environment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.149430; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34399331/,192

Elderly-onset RA can be assumed as a benign form of RA. Until recently, face-to-face therapeutic sessions between health professionals and patients are usually the method of its treatment. However, during pandemics, including coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), teletherapeutic sessions can extensively increase the patient safety especially in elderly patients who are more vulnerable to these infections. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate a novel teletherapy approach for management of elderly patients suffering from RA by utilizing laser acupuncture. METHODS A teletherapy system was used for management of elderly patients suffering from RA. Sixty participants were allocated randomly into two groups and the ratio was 1:1. Patients in the first group were treated with laser acupuncture and telerehabilitation sessions, which consisted of aerobic exercise and virtual reality training. Patients in the second group received telerehabilitation sessions, which consisted of aerobic exercise and virtual reality training. Evaluation of patients was done by using the Health Assessment questionnaire (HAQ), the Rheumatoid Arthritis Quality of Life (RAQoL) questionnaire, and the analysis of interleukin-6 (IL-6), serum C-reactive protein (CRP), plasma adenosine triphosphate (ATP) concentration and plasma malondialdehyde (MDA). RESULTS A statistically significant difference was found in CRP, RAQoL, IL-6 and MDA between the pre- and post-treatments in the first group (p < 0.05) favouring the post-treatment group, while the HAQ showed a statistically significant difference between pre- and post-treatments (p < 0.05) in both groups. Statistically significant post-treatment differences were also observed between the two groups (p < 0.05) in RAQoL, CRP, ATP and MDA, favouring the first group. DISCUSSION Laser acupuncture teletherapy could be suggested as a reliable treatment method for elderly patients suffering from RA, as it can provide a safe and effective therapeutic approach. Teletherapy provided safer access to health professionals and patients while giving a high patient satisfaction value with a relatively lower cost (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04684693).","Adly, Aya Sedky; Adly, Afnan Sedky; Adly, Mahmoud Sedky; Ali, Mohammad F",Journal of telemedicine and telecare,https://doi.org/10.1177/1357633x211009861; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33966520/,192

STUDY DESIGN Observational study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY Fauji Foundation Hospital, Rawalpindi from April to July 2020. METHODOLOGY All 58 patients (n=58) presenting with acute appendicitis (AA) were included. Assessment was done with Alvarado score (AS) and ultrasound. Treatment was initiated according to the algorithm corresponding with AS. Those with AS score of 4 or less were started on outpatient oral antibiotics. Patients with AS score of 5 or more were admitted for IV antibiotics. If the symptoms and signs resolved, they were sent home on oral antibiotics to complete a course of 5 days. If their condition did not improve in 72 hours or deteriorated at any time, appendectomy was done. Outcomes were recorded and analysed on SPSS. RESULTS Out of 58 patients, 16 were treated with oral, while 42 with IV antibiotics. This yielded a statistically significant difference on the course of disease (p=0.028). Resolution of symptoms was seen in 27.6% (n=16) with conservative management; whereas, 72.4% (n=42) patients needed a subsequent appendectomy. The difference in operative findings between patients, who had been given oral or IV antibiotics was statistically insignificant (p=0.536). Diagnostic value of leukocyte count (TLC), ultrasound and AS was not found to be significant. CONCLUSION Non-operative management is successful in about a quarter of the patients of AA. There is very limited value of sonography, laboratory parameters, or AS in confirming the diagnosis of AA.

117873,Predicting burst pressure of radiofrequency-induced colorectal anastomosis by bio-impedance measurement.,2017,"BACKGROUND Xenon was shown to cause less hemodynamic instability and reduce vasopressor needs during off-pump coronary artery bypass (OPCAB) surgery when compared with conventionally used anesthetics. As xenon exerts its organ protective properties even in subanesthetic concentrations, we hypothesized that in patients undergoing OPCAB surgery, 30% xenon added to general anesthesia with propofol results in superior hemodynamic stability when compared to anesthesia with propofol alone. METHODS Fifty patients undergoing elective OPCAB surgery were randomized to receive general anesthesia with 30% xenon adjuvant to a target-controlled infusion of propofol or with propofol alone. The primary end point was the total intraoperative dose of norepinephrine required to maintain an intraoperative mean arterial pressure >70 mm Hg. Secondary outcomes included the perioperative cardiorespiratory profile and the incidence of adverse and serious adverse events. RESULTS Adding xenon to propofol anesthesia resulted in a significant reduction of norepinephrine required to attain the predefined hemodynamic goals (cumulative intraoperative dose: median [interquartile range]: 370 [116-570] vs 840 [335-1710] µg, P = .001). In the xenon-propofol group, significantly less propofol was required to obtain a similar depth of anesthesia as judged by clinical signs and the bispectral index (propofol effect site concentration [mean ± SD]: 1.8 ± 0.5 vs 2.8 ± 0.3 mg, P≤ .0001). Moreover, the xenon-propofol group required significantly less norepinephrine during the first 24 hours on the intensive care unit (median [interquartile range]: 1.5 [0.1-7] vs 5 [2-8] mg, P = .048). Other outcomes and safety parameters were similar in both groups. CONCLUSIONS Thirty percent xenon added to propofol anesthesia improves hemodynamic stability by decreasing norepinephrine requirements in patients undergoing OPCAB surgery.","Al Tmimi, Layth; Devroe, Sarah; Dewinter, Geertrui; Van de Velde, Marc; Poortmans, Gert; Meyns, Bart; Meuris, Bart; Coburn, Mark; Rex, Steffen",Anesthesia and analgesia,https://doi.org/10.1213/ane.0000000000002179; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28598913/,192

117988,Medicine's longest year.,2021-03-19,"BMP2 and BMP7, which use bovine Achilles tendon-derived absorbable collagen sponge and bovine bone collagen as scaffold, respectively, have been approved as bone graft substitutes for orthopedic and dental indications. Here, we describe an osteoinductive autologous bone graft substitute (ABGS) that contains recombinant human BMP6 (rhBMP6) dispersed within autologous blood coagulum (ABC) scaffold. The ABGS is created as an injectable or implantable coagulum gel with rhBMP6 binding tightly to plasma proteins within fibrin meshwork, as examined by dot-blot assays, and is released slowly as an intact protein over 6 to 8 days, as assessed by ELISA. The biological activity of ABGS was examined in vivo in rats (Rattus norvegicus) and rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus). In a rat subcutaneous implant assay, ABGS induced endochondral bone formation, as observed by histology and micro-CT analyses. In the rabbit ulna segmental defect model, a reproducible and robust bone formation with complete bridging and restoration of the defect was observed, which is dose dependent, as determined by radiographs, micro-CT, and histological analyses. In ABGS, ABC scaffold provides a permissive environment for bone induction and contributes to the use of lower doses of rhBMP6 compared with BMP7 in bovine bone collagen as scaffold. The newly formed bone undergoes remodeling and establishes cortices uniformly that is restricted to implant site by bridging with host bone. In summary, ABC carrier containing rhBMP6 may serve as an osteoinductive autologous bone graft substitute for several orthopedic applications that include delayed and nonunion fractures, anterior and posterior lumbar interbody fusion, trauma, and nonunions associated with neurofibromatosis type I.","Grgurevic, Lovorka; Oppermann, Hermann; Pecin, Marko; Erjavec, Igor; Capak, Hrvoje; Pauk, Martina; Karlovic, Sven; Kufner, Vera; Lipar, Marija; Bubic Spoljar, Jadranka; Bordukalo-Niksic, Tatjana; Maticic, Drazen; Peric, Mihaela; Windhager, Reinhard; Sampath, T Kuber; Vukicevic, Slobodan",JBMR plus,https://doi.org/10.1002/jbm4.10085; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31131338/,192

Gram-negative bloodstream infections (GNBSIs) harboring such difficult-to-treat resistance (DTR) may have higher mortality than phenotypes that allow for ≥1 active first-line antibiotic. Methods The Premier Database was analyzed for inpatients with select GNBSIs. DTR was defined as intermediate/resistant in vitro to all ß-lactam categories, including carbapenems and fluoroquinolones. Prevalence and aminoglycoside resistance of DTR episodes were compared with carbapenem-resistant, extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant, and fluoroquinolone-resistant episodes using CDC definitions. Predictors of DTR were identified. The adjusted relative risk (aRR) of mortality was examined for DTR, CDC-defined phenotypes susceptible to ≥1 first-line agent, and graded loss of active categories. Results Between 2009-2013, 471 (1%) of 45011 GNBSI episodes at 92 (53.2%) of 173 hospitals exhibited DTR, ranging from 0.04% for Escherichia coli to 18.4% for Acinetobacter baumannii. Among patients with DTR, 79% received parenteral aminoglycosides, tigecycline, or colistin/polymyxin-B; resistance to all aminoglycosides occurred in 33%. Predictors of DTR included urban healthcare and higher baseline illness. Crude mortality for GNBSIs with DTR was 43%; aRR was higher for DTR than for carbapenem-resistant (1.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.0-1.4; P = .02), extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant (1.2; 1.1-1.4; P = .001), or fluoroquinolone-resistant (1.2; 1.0-1.4; P = .008) infections. The mortality aRR increased 20% per graded loss of active first-line categories, from 3-5 to 1-2 to 0. Conclusion Nonsusceptibility to first-line antibiotics is associated with decreased survival in GNBSIs.

OBJECTIVE To evaluate whether noninvasive ventilation improves outcomes among patients developing hypoxemic acute respiratory failure after abdominal surgery. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Multicenter, randomized, parallel-group clinical trial conducted between May 2013 and September 2014 in 20 French intensive care units among 293 patients who had undergone abdominal surgery and developed hypoxemic respiratory failure (partial oxygen pressure <60 mm Hg or oxygen saturation [SpO2] ≤90% when breathing room air or <80 mm Hg when breathing 15 L/min of oxygen, plus either [1] a respiratory rate above 30/min or [2] clinical signs suggestive of intense respiratory muscle work and/or labored breathing) if it occurred within 7 days after surgical procedure. INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomly assigned to receive standard oxygen therapy (up to 15 L/min to maintain SpO2 of 94% or higher) (n = 145) or NIV delivered via facial mask (inspiratory pressure support level, 5-15 cm H2O; positive end-expiratory pressure, 5-10 cm H2O; fraction of inspired oxygen titrated to maintain SpO2 ≥94%) (n = 148). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was tracheal reintubation for any cause within 7 days of randomization. Secondary outcomes were gas exchange, invasive ventilation-free days at day 30, health care-associated infections, and 90-day mortality. RESULTS Among the 293 patients (mean age, 63.4 [SD, 13.8] years; n=224 men) included in the intention-to-treat analysis, reintubation occurred in 49 of 148 (33.1%) in the NIV group and in 66 of 145 (45.5%) in the standard oxygen therapy group within+ 7 days after randomization (absolute difference, -12.4%; 95% CI, -23.5% to -1.3%; P = .03). Noninvasive ventilation was associated with significantly more invasive ventilation-free days compared with standard oxygen therapy (25.4 vs 23.2 days; absolute difference, -2.2 days; 95% CI, -0.1 to 4.6 days; P = .04), while fewer patients developed health care-associated infections (43/137 [31.4%] vs 63/128 [49.2%]; absolute difference, -17.8%; 95% CI, -30.2% to -5.4%; P = .003). At 90 days, 22 of 148 patients (14.9%) in the NIV group and 31 of 144 (21.5%) in the standard oxygen therapy group had died (absolute difference, -6.5%; 95% CI, -16.0% to 3.0%; P = .15). There were no significant differences in gas exchange. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure following abdominal surgery, use of NIV compared with standard oxygen therapy reduced the risk of tracheal reintubation within 7 days. These findings support use of NIV in this setting.

Although an increase of the peripheral IP-10 level is known in HBV-infected patients, the molecular basis of HBV infection inducing IP-10 expression has remained elusive. In the present study, we demonstrate that hepatitis B virus protein X (HBx) increases IP-10 expression in a dose-dependent manner. Transfection of the HBx-expressing vector into HepG2 cells results in nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB, which directly binds the promoter of IP-10 at positions from -122 to -113, thus facilitating transcription. The addition of the NF-kappaB inhibitor blocks the effect of HBx on IP-10 induction. In parallel, increase of NF-kappaB subunits p65 and p50 in HepG2 cells also augments IP-10 expression. Furthermore, we show that HBx induces activation of NF-kappaB through the TRAF2/TAK1 signaling pathway, leading to up-regulation of IP-10 expression. As a consequence, up-regulation of IP-10 may mediate the migration of peripheral blood leukocytes in a NF-kappaB-dependent manner. In conclusion, we report a novel molecular mechanism of HBV infection inducing IP-10 expression, which involves viral protein HBx affecting NF-kappaB pathway, leading to transactivation of the IP-10 promoter. Our study provides insight into the migration of leukocytes in response to HBV infection, thus causing immune pathological injury of liver.","Zhou, Yu; Wang, Shuo; Ma, Jing-Wei; Lei, Zhang; Zhu, Hui-Fen; Lei, Ping; Yang, Zhuo-Shun; Zhang, Biao; Yao, Xin-Xin; Shi, Chuan; Sun, Li-Fang; Wu, Xiong-Wen; Ning, Qin; Shen, Guan-Xin; Huang, Bo",The Journal of biological chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.m109.067629; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20164184/,192

METHODS The study was conducted in 359 cognitively impaired patients who met the pathological criteria for AD (NIA-Reagan intermediate or high). The mean age at onset was 69.5 ± 8.8 years (range 37-95) and the mean duration of the symptoms was 10.5 ± 4.2 years. The association between symptoms duration and HS and TDP-43 was examined with logistic regression analyses controlling for age at death, atherosclerosis in the Circle of Willis (CW), cerebral infarcts, gender, baseline Mini Mental State Examination scores, APOE-4 allele, and presence of Lewy bodies (LB).

Cross-species transmission of CPV occurs as a result of mutations on the viral capsid surface that alter the species-specific binding to the host receptor, transferrin receptor type-1 (TfR). The interaction between CPV and TfR has been extensively studied, and previous analyses have suggested that the CPV-TfR complex is asymmetric. To enhance the understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms, we determined the CPV-TfR interaction using cryo-electron microscopy to solve the icosahedral (3.0-Å resolution) and asymmetric (5.0-Å resolution) complex structures. Structural analyses revealed conformational variations of the TfR molecules relative to the binding site, which translated into dynamic molecular interactions between CPV and TfR. The precise footprint of the receptor on the virus capsid was identified, along with the identity of the amino acid residues in the virus-receptor interface. Our ""rock-and-roll"" model provides an explanation for previous findings and gives insights into species jumping and the variation in host ranges associated with new pandemics in dogs.","Lee, Hyunwook; Callaway, Heather M; Cifuente, Javier O; Bator, Carol M; Parrish, Colin R; Hafenstein, Susan L",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1904918116; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31548398/,192

This paper presents the results of a meta-analysis to determine whether the weight of the evidence supports such an association. Studies with a categorical diagnosis of autism as the outcome and an assessment of its association with prenatal maternal infection or fever (or the data necessary to compute this association) were included. A total of 36 studies met these criteria. Two independent reviewers extracted data on study design, methods of assessment, type of infectious agent, site of infection, trimester of exposure, definition of autism, and effect size. Analyses demonstrated a statistically significant association of maternal infection/fever with autism in offspring (OR = 1.32; 95% CI = 1.20-1.46). Adjustment for evident publication bias slightly weakened this association. There was little variation in effect sizes across agent or site of infection. Small differences across trimester of exposure were not statistically significant. There was some evidence that recall bias associated with status on the outcome variable leads to differential misclassification of exposure status. Nonetheless, the overall association is only modestly reduced when studies potentially contaminated by such bias are removed. Although causality has not been firmly established, these findings suggest maternal infection during pregnancy confers an increase in risk for autism in offspring. Given the prevalence of this risk factor, it is possible that the incidence of autism would be reduced by 12%-17% if maternal infections could be prevented or safely treated in a timely manner. LAY SUMMARY: This study is a meta-analysis of the association of maternal infection during pregnancy and subsequent autism in offspring. In combining the results from 36 studies of this association we find that a significant relationship is present. The association does not vary much across the types of infections or when they occur during pregnancy. We conclude that the incidence of autism could be substantially reduced if maternal infections could be prevented or safely treated in a timely manner.","Tioleco, Nina; Silberman, Anna E; Stratigos, Katharine; Banerjee-Basu, Sharmila; Spann, Marisa N; Whitaker, Agnes H; Turner, J Blake",Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research,https://doi.org/10.1002/aur.2499; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33720503/,192
124550,Reply.,2021-02-04,"BACKGROUND Hypothermia is being used with increasing frequency to prevent or mitigate various types of neurologic injury. In addition, symptomatic fever control is becoming an increasingly accepted goal of therapy in patients with neurocritical illness. However, effectively controlling fever and inducing hypothermia poses special challenges to the intensive care unit team and others involved in the care of critically ill patients. OBJECTIVE To discuss practical aspects and pitfalls of therapeutic temperature management in critically ill patients, and to review the currently available cooling methods. DESIGN Review article. INTERVENTIONS None. MAIN RESULTS Cooling can be divided into three distinct phases: induction, maintenance, and rewarming. Each has its own risks and management problems. A number of cooling devices that have reached the market in recent years enable reliable maintenance and slow and controlled rewarming. In the induction phase, rapid cooling rates can be achieved by combining cold fluid infusion (1500-3000 mL 4 degrees C saline or Ringer's lactate) with an invasive or surface cooling device. Rapid induction decreases the risks and consequences of short-term side effects, such as shivering and metabolic disorders. Cardiovascular effects include bradycardia and a rise in blood pressure. Hypothermia's effect on myocardial contractility is variable (depending on heart rate and filling pressure); in most patients myocardial contractility will increase, although mild diastolic dysfunction can develop in some patients. A risk of clinically significant arrhythmias occurs only if core temperature decreases below 30 degrees C. The most important long-term side effects of hypothermia are infections (usually of the respiratory tract or wounds) and bedsores. CONCLUSIONS Temperature management and hypothermia induction are gaining importance in critical care medicine. Intensive care unit physicians, critical care nurses, and others (emergency physicians, neurologists, and cardiologists) should be familiar with the physiologic effects, current indications, techniques, complications and practical issues of temperature management, and induced hypothermia. In experienced hands the technique is safe and highly effective.","Polderman, Kees H; Herold, Ingeborg",Critical care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/ccm.0b013e3181962ad5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19237924/,192

However, similar studies are relatively rare in China. This study aims to investigate the association between COVID-19 and meteorological factors, such as average temperature, relative humidity (ARH), and air quality index (AQI), and average wind speed. We collected the daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 and meteorological factors in Shanghai China from January 10, 2020 to March 31, 2020. A generalized additive model (GAM) was fitted to quantify the associations between meteorological factors and COVID-19 during the study period. A negative association between average temperature and daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 was found on lag 13 days. In addition, we observed significantly positive correlation between meteorological factors (AQI, relative humidity) and daily confirmed cases of COVID-19. A 10 increase in AQI (lag1/7/8/9/10 days) was correlated with a 4.2%~9.0% increase in the daily confirmed cases of COVID-19. A 1% increase in relative humidity (lag1/4/7/8/9/10 days) was correlated with 1.7%~3.7% increase in the daily confirmed cases of COVID-19. However, the associations between average wind speed and the daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 is complex in different lag days. In summary, meteorological factors could affect the occurrence of COVID-19. Reducing the effects of meteorological factors on COVID-19 may be an important public health action for the prevention and control of COVID-19. This article is protected by copyright.

In recent years, however, accumulating evidence points to a nonhemostatic role for platelets, as active participants in the inflammatory and immune responses to microbial organisms in infectious diseases. This stems from the ability of activated platelets to secrete a plethora of immunomodulatory cytokines and chemokines, as well as directly interplaying with viral receptors. While much attention has been given to the role of the cytokine storm in the severity of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), less is known about the contribution of platelets to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Here, we give a brief overview on the platelet contribution to antiviral immunity and response during SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Allaoui, Afaf; Khawaja, Akif A; Badad, Oussama; Naciri, Mariam; Lordkipanidzé, Marie; Guessous, Fadila; Zaid, Younes",Seminars in thrombosis and hemostasis,https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0041-1726033; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33851385/,192

Employing structure- and QSAR-based drug design strategies, we rationally designed, synthesized, and biologically evaluated a series of novel triazole-based S1R antagonists. Compound 10 exhibited potent binding affinity for S1R, high selectivity over S2R and 87 other human targets, acceptable in vitro metabolic stability, slow clearance in liver microsomes, and excellent blood-brain barrier permeability in rats. Further in vivo studies in rats showed that 10 exhibited negligible acute toxicity in the rotarod test and statistically significant analgesic effects in the formalin test for acute inflammatory pain and paclitaxel-induced neuropathic pain models during cancer chemotherapy. These encouraging results promote further development of our triazole-based S1R antagonists as novel treatments for pain of different etiologies.","Peng, Youyi; Zhang, Qiang; Welsh, William J",Journal of medicinal chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.0c01964; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33372782/,192

Six replicated experiments were conducted between 2010 and 2016 with field-grown basil of a susceptible cultivar exposed to naturally occurring wind-dispersed sporangiospores of P. belbahrii to evaluate conventional fungicides registered for basil downy mildew in the United States and in development for this use. This project revealed the importance for successful management of using a preventive fungicide application schedule, maintaining a 7-day application interval, and using application equipment designed to provide thorough spray coverage to plants (drop nozzles). Fungicide efficacy was assessed based on incidence of symptomatic leaves rather than disease severity, which is stringent but realistic because there is zero tolerance for disease on fresh-market herbs. Most fungicides were tested as the formulated product marketed in the United States. Oxathiapiprolin was tested as experimental formulations. Its trade name is Orondis. Overall best control was achieved in 2016. Excellent control (99% based on AUDPC values) was obtained with four fungicide programs with oxathiapiprolin, Revus, and ProPhyt, indicating this combination of chemistry was more important than specific timing for each fungicide. Ranman applied in alternation with Revus plus K-Phite was not quite as effective (89% control); this treatment was ineffective in 2015 when the 7-day spray interval was not maintained. Best treatment in 2015 was Quadris applied in alternation with Revus plus oxathiapiprolin for two of three Revus applications. Two different alternations of these fungicides also were effective. But Quadris alternated with Revus was ineffective. When tested singly, the most effective fungicides in 2013 (listed in order based on AUDPC values) were Zampro, Revus, oxathiapiprolin, and Ranman. ProPhyt was effective in 2013 but not in 2012, when another phosphorous acid fungicide, K-Phite, also was ineffective. Only oxathiapiprolin and Zampro were effective in the 2012 experiment; Revus and Ranman were ineffective. Presidio was ineffective both years. Based on the results from this study, Orondis is the most effective fungicide among those evaluated for managing basil downy mildew, and Zampro is second. Neither were labeled for this use on field-grown basil as of June 2020. Ranman applied in alternation with Revus plus K-Phite, a commonly recommended program of labeled fungicides, provided very good control.","McGrath, Margaret Tuttle",Plant disease,https://doi.org/10.1094/pdis-11-19-2382-re; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32830999/,192
125759,Norm index-based QSAR models for acute toxicity of organic compounds toward zebrafish embryo.,2020-10-15,"Introduction: Patients with multimorbidity are expected to adhere to complex medication regimens in order to manage their multiple chronic conditions. It has been reported the likelihood of adherence decreases as patients are prescribed more medications. Much medication adherence research to date is dominated by a single-disease focus, which is at odds with the rising prevalence of multimorbidity and may artificially underestimate the complexity of managing chronic illness. This review aims to describe the prevalence of medication non-adherence among patients with multimorbidity, and to identify potential predictors of non-adherence in this population. Methods: A systematic review will be conducted and reported according to PRISMA guidelines. PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL and PsycINFO will be searched using a predefined search strategy from 2009-2019. Quantitative studies will be considered eligible for review if prevalence of medication non-adherence among adults with two or more chronic conditions is reported. Studies will be included in the review if available in English full text. Titles and abstracts will be screened by single review, with 20% of screening cross-checked by a second reviewer. Full-text articles will be screened by two independent reviewers, noting reasons for exclusions. Data extraction will be performed using a predefined extraction form. Quality and risk of bias assessment will be conducted using criteria for observational studies outlined by Sanderson et al. (2007). A narrative synthesis and, if feasible, meta-analysis will be conducted. Discussion: By exploring medication non-adherence from a multimorbidity perspective, the review aims to inform an evidence base for intervention development which accounts for the rising prevalence of patients with multiple chronic conditions. Study registration: The systematic review is prospectively registered in PROSPERO ( CRD42019133849); registered on 12 June 2019.","Foley, Louise; Larkin, James; Lombard-Vance, Richard; Murphy, Andrew W; Molloy, Gerard J",HRB open research,https://doi.org/10.12688/hrbopenres.12961.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32296748/,192

The objective of this study was to evaluate the volume of the resected stomach (VRS) as a predictor of the percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL) 1 year after LSG. METHODS This was a single-surgeon study of prospectively collected data of patients who underwent LSG at Jordan University Hospital (February 2009 to February 2012). The VRS was measured using a standardized technique. The %EWL was calculated at 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. The correlation between the VRS and %EWL was statistically evaluated. RESULTS Ninety patients underwent LSG during the study period. Of these, 73 patients (57 female) completed at least 1 year of follow-up and were analyzed; their body mass index was 45 ± 7.6 kg/m(2) (33-81). The VRS was 1,337.4 ± 435.2 ml (600-2,800). The %EWL was 33.6 ± 11.1 % at 3 months, 48.6 ± 15.5 % at 6 months, and 56.8 ± 18.9 % at 12 months. A significant correlation was observed between the VRS and %EWL at 1 year (p = 0.003). Patients with a VRS of >1,100 ml (n = 43) achieved significantly greater %EWL at 12 months than did those with a VRS of ≤ 1,100 (n = 30). Removal of >1,100 ml of gastric volume was associated with a sensitivity and specificity of 75.5 and 46.2 %, respectively, for achieving a %EWL of ≥ 50 %. CONCLUSION The VRS can be used as an indicator of excess weight loss 1 year after LSG.","Obeidat, Firas W; Shanti, Hiba A; Mismar, Ayman A; Elmuhtaseb, M S; Al-Qudah, Mohammad S",Obesity surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-014-1330-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24938678/,192

STUDY DESIGN Controlled randomized experimental study. ANIMALS Adult Quarter Horse and Thoroughbred horses (n = 5). METHODS One 6.25 cm(2) wound was created on the dorsomedial aspect of the proximal metacarpus on each forelimb. A SPF dressing was applied to 1 randomly assigned limb as a treatment and a non-adherent, absorbent dressing was applied to the opposite limb as control. Bandages were changed every 3 days for 60 days. Granulation tissue was scored every 3 days, wound area measured every 6 days, and wound bed was cultured every 12 days. RESULTS SPF-treatment wounds had significantly decreased wound area and decreased granulation tissue scores when evaluated <30 days and over the 60 day study, although complete wound healing times were not significantly different. Bacteria were cultured from all wounds at varying times throughout the study. CONCLUSIONS The SPF wound dressing improved some measures of wound healing compared with the control dressing, most significantly during the first 30 days. This suggests that the SPF wound dressing may be useful in the early management of wounds on the equine lower limb. Further studies using the SPF dressing are needed to characterize the temporal and cellular effects on wound healing and evaluate this dressing in a clinical environment.","Kelleher, Maureen E; Kilcoyne, Isabelle; Dechant, Julie E; Hummer, Emma; Kass, Philip H; Snyder, Jack R",Veterinary surgery : VS,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-950x.2014.12240.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25040441/,192

Engaging in research co-design - the meaningful involvement of end-users in research - may help address this research waste. This rapid overview of reviews addressed three related questions, namely (1) what approaches to research co-design exist in health settings? (2) What activities do these research co-design approaches involve? (3) What do we know about the effectiveness of existing research co-design approaches? The review focused on the study planning phase of research, defined as the point up to which the research question and study design are finalised. METHODS Reviews of research co-design were systematically identified using a rapid overview of reviews approach (PROSPERO: CRD42019123034). The search strategy encompassed three academic databases, three grey literature databases, and a hand-search of the journal Research Involvement and Engagement. Two reviewers independently conducted the screening and data extraction and resolved disagreements through discussion. Disputes were resolved through discussion with a senior author (PB). One reviewer performed quality assessment. The results were narratively synthesised. RESULTS A total of 26 records (reporting on 23 reviews) met the inclusion criteria. Reviews varied widely in their application of 'research co-design' and their application contexts, scope and theoretical foci. The research co-design approaches identified involved interactions with end-users outside of study planning, such as recruitment and dissemination. Activities involved in research co-design included focus groups, interviews and surveys. The effectiveness of research co-design has rarely been evaluated empirically or experimentally; however, qualitative exploration has described the positive and negative outcomes associated with co-design. The research provided many recommendations for conducting research co-design, including training participating end-users in research skills, having regular communication between researchers and end-users, setting clear end-user expectations, and assigning set roles to all parties involved in co-design. CONCLUSIONS Research co-design appears to be widely used but seldom described or evaluated in detail. Though it has rarely been tested empirically or experimentally, existing research suggests that it can benefit researchers, practitioners, research processes and research outcomes. Realising the potential of research co-design may require the development of clearer and more consistent terminology, better reporting of the activities involved and better evaluation.","Slattery, Peter; Saeri, Alexander K; Bragge, Peter",Health research policy and systems,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12961-020-0528-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32046728/,192

The aim of this study was to derive reference data for VD and T1/2 and also to provide reference data for GFR from studies performed using Tc-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (Tc-DTPA). METHODS This was a retrospective study of 126 healthy potential kidney donors (age range 18-59 years). The GFR was evaluated from Tc-DTPA plasma clearance using the 2004 British Nuclear Medicine Society guidelines. The association between VD and body surface area (BSA) was assessed. T1/2 was correlated with age and GFR. The correlation between the Brochner-Mortensen-corrected GFR (BM-GFRCorr) and age was evaluated. RESULTS The uncorrected VD value (l) was 10.1×BSA±40.6% (P<0.01). The corrected VD value (l) was 8.19×BSA±34.4% (P<0.01). In individuals under the age of 40 years, the mean T1/2 was 95.0 min±36.2%. In individuals aged 40 years and above, the T1/2 increased at a rate of 0.49 min/year (P=0.04); the T1/2 (min) was 9480×(1/BM-GFRCorr)±35.1% (P<0.01). In individuals younger than 40 years of age, the correlation between BM-GFRCorr and age was not statistically significant (P=0.45), and the mean GFR was 108 ml/min/1.73 m±27.5%. In individuals aged 40 years and above, the BM-GFRCorr was 170-(1.55×age) ml/min/1.73 m±36.7% (P<0.001).

METHODS This prospective study included 169 newborns, sixteen of whom had perinatal asphyxia and 33 who were from complicated pregnancies. Doppler measurements were obtained from the uterine, umbilical and middle cerebral arteries, and the cerebro/placental ratio (C/P). IMA was measured by means of commercially available ELISA kits and was expressed as picomoles per milliliter. RESULTS Ischemia-modified albumin levels were significantly higher in neonates of complicated pregnancies as compared to uncomplicated pregnancies (P < 0.0001). They were higher in newborns with perinatal asphyxia as compared to healthy controls (P = 0.015). The C/P ratio-pulsatility index (PI) showed a significant difference between normal and complicated pregnancies without perinatal asphyxia (P < 0.0001). IMA levels were significantly increased in cases with abnormal C/P ratio-PI. CONCLUSIONS Elevated cord blood IMA levels may be accepted as a useful marker in perinatal asphyxia.

129411,Experimental study of the potential hazards of surgical smoke from powered instruments.,2015,"PURPOSE Providers have cited fear of taking away hope from patients as one of the principal reasons for deferring advance care planning (ACP). However, research is lacking on the relationship between ACP and hope. We sought to investigate the potential association between ACP and hope in advanced cancer. METHODS This is a cross-sectional analysis of baseline data from a primary palliative care intervention trial. All patients had advanced solid cancers. Three domains of ACP were measured using validated questions to assess discussion with oncologists about end-of-life (EOL) planning, selection of a surrogate decision maker, and completion of an advance directive. Hope was measured using the Hearth Hope Index (HHI). Multivariable regression was performed, adjusting for variables associated with hope or ACP. RESULTS A total of 672 patients were included in this analysis. The mean age was 69.3 ± 10.2 years; 54% were female, and 94% were White. Twenty percent of patients (132 of 661) reported having a discussion about EOL planning, 51% (342 of 668) reported completing an advance directive, and 85% (565 of 666) had chosen a surrogate. There was no difference in hope between patients who had and had not had an EOL discussion (adjusted mean difference in HHI, 0.55; P = .181 for adjusted regression), chosen a surrogate (adjusted HHI difference, 0.31; P = .512), or completed an advance directive (adjusted HHI difference, 0.11; P = .752). CONCLUSION In this study, hope was equivalent among patients who had or had not completed 3 important domains of ACP. These findings do not support concerns that ACP is associated with decreased hope for patients with advanced cancer.","Cohen, Michael G; Althouse, Andrew D; Arnold, Robert M; Bulls, Hailey W; White, Douglas; Chu, Edward; Rosenzweig, Margaret; Smith, Kenneth; Schenker, Yael",JCO oncology practice,https://doi.org/10.1200/op.20.00039; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32530807/,192
129470,Myofascial pain and pelvic floor dysfunction in patients with interstitial cystitis.,2011,"Delivery of genetic material to tissues in vivo is an important technique used in research settings and is the foundation upon which clinical gene therapy is built. The lung is a prime target for gene delivery due to a host of genetic, acquired, and infectious diseases that manifest themselves there, resulting in many pathologies. However, the in vivo delivery of genetic material to the lung remains a practical problem clinically and is considered the major obstacle needed to be overcome for gene therapy. Currently there are four main strategies for in vivo gene delivery to the lung: viral vectors, liposomes, nanoparticles, and electroporation. Viral delivery uses several different genetically modified viruses that enter the cell and express desired genes that have been inserted to the viral genome. Liposomes use combinations of charged and neutral lipids that can encapsulate genetic cargo and enter cells through endogenous mechanisms, thereby delivering their cargoes. Nanoparticles are defined by their size (typically less than 100 nm) and are made up of many different classes of building blocks, including biological and synthetic polymers, cell penetrant and other peptides, and dendrimers, that also enter cells through endogenous mechanisms. Electroporation uses mild to moderate electrical pulses to create pores in the cell membrane through which delivered genetic material can enter a cell. An emerging fifth category, exosomes and extracellular vesicles, may have advantages of both viral and non-viral approaches. These extracellular vesicles bud from cellular membranes containing receptors and ligands that may aid cell targeting and which can be loaded with genetic material for efficient transfer. Each of these vectors can be used for different gene delivery applications based on mechanisms of action, side-effects, and other factors, and their use in the lung and possible clinical considerations is the primary focus of this review.","Baliga, Uday K; Dean, David A",Experimental biology and medicine,https://doi.org/10.1177/1535370220965985; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33183069/,192

Since many promising applications have been reported so far, our aim was to evaluate its potential concentration- and time- dependent cytotoxic and genotoxic effects in vitro. To that end we exposed human peripheral blood mononuclear cells to 0.5, 1, and 2 mg/mL of yellow gentian root extract (YGRE) to determine its effects on oxidative stress parameters [pro/antioxidant balance (PAB) and lipid peroxidation], DNA damage (alkaline comet assay and chromosome aberrations), and cell viability (trypan blue exclusion test). Cell viability decreased with increasing concentrations and treatment duration. Only the lowest YGRE concentration (0.5 mg/mL) increased oxidative stress but produced minor DNA damage and cytotoxicity. At higher concentrations, redox parameters returned to near control values. The percentage of chromosome aberrations and percentage of DNA in the comet tail increased with increased YGRE concentration after 48 h and declined after 72 h of treatment. This points to the activation of DNA repair mechanism (homologous recombination), evidenced by the formation of chromosomal radial figures after 72 h of treatment with the highest YGRE concentration of 2 mg/mL. Our results suggest that YGRE, despite induction of cytotoxic and genotoxic effects, activates cell repair mechanisms that counter oxidative and DNA lesions and induce cell death in highly damaged cells. Therefore, observed protective effects of yellow gentian after longer exposure could be a result of activated repair and removal of cells with irreparable damage.","Šobot, Ana Valenta; Drakulić, Dunja; Joksić, Gordana; Vukajlović, Jadranka Miletić; Savić, Jasmina; Potočnik, Jelena; Tričković, Jelena Filipović",Arhiv za higijenu rada i toksikologiju,https://doi.org/10.2478/aiht-2020-71-3476; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33410776/,192

METHOD A prospective randomized controlled open label study was conducted on 75 breast cancer patients receiving adjuvant paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 weekly for 12 weeks. Eligible patients were randomized to either the low dose group; 1200 mg daily NAC, the high dose group; 1200 mg NAC twice daily or the control group; received paclitaxel only. The primary endpoint was the incidence of different grades of PIPN using National Cancer Institute's common toxicity criteria for adverse event (NCI-CTCAE) while secondary endpoints were the severity of PIPN using modified total neuropathy score (mTNS), quality of life (QOL) using Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy/Gynecologic Oncology Group-Neurotoxicity (FACT-GOG-NTX) subscale, serum nerve growth factor (NGF), and serum malondialdehyde (MDA). RESULTS At the end of the 12-week period, the incidence of grade (2, 3) peripheral neuropathy was significantly lower in the high dose group (28.6%) compared to the low dose group (61.9%) and the control group (100%), p value < 0.001. A significant improvement in the mTNS and QOL scores was observed after 6 and 12 weeks in the high dose group and the low dose group compared to the control, p value < 0.001. Significantly higher levels of serum NGF in the high dose group and lower level of serum MDA in the high dose and the low dose group were observed. CONCLUSION Oral NAC (1200 mg once and twice daily) might reduce the incidence and severity of PIPN and improve the patients' QOL.

This study investigated whether intraoperative EEG suppression was an independent predictor of 90 day postoperative mortality and explored risk factors for EEG suppression. METHODS This observational study included 2662 adults enrolled in the B-Unaware or BAG-RECALL trials. A cohort was defined with >5 cumulative minutes of EEG suppression, and 1:2 propensity-matched to a non-suppressed cohort (≤5 min suppression). We evaluated the association between EEG suppression and mortality using multivariable logistic regression, and examined risk factors for EEG suppression using zero-inflated mixed effects analysis. RESULTS Ninety day postoperative mortality was 3.9% overall, 6.3% in the suppressed cohort, and 3.0% in the non-suppressed cohort {odds ratio (OR) [95% confidence interval (CI)]=2.19 (1.48-3.26)}. After matching and multivariable adjustment, EEG suppression was not associated with mortality [OR (95% CI)=0.83 (0.55-1.25)]; however, the interaction between EEG suppression and mean arterial pressure (MAP) <55 mm Hg was [OR (95% CI)=2.96 (1.34-6.52)]. Risk factors for EEG suppression were older age, number of comorbidities, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and higher intraoperative doses of benzodiazepines, opioids, or volatile anaesthetics. EEG suppression was less likely in patients with cancer, preoperative alcohol, opioid or benzodiazepine consumption, and intraoperative nitrous oxide exposure. CONCLUSIONS Although EEG suppression was associated with increasing anaesthetic administration and comorbidities, the hypothesis that intraoperative EEG suppression is a predictor of postoperative mortality was only supported if it was coincident with low MAP.

To investigate the involvement of these viruses in respiratory disease, a highly sensitive nested PCR was used to screen a large archive of respiratory specimens, collected between January and December 2007. Respiratory samples had previously been tested for eight respiratory viruses, including respiratory syncytial virus and adenovirus, by PCR. HPeV was detected in 34 of 3,844 specimens, representing 27 of 2,220 study subjects (1.2%). HPeV types were identified by sequencing the VP3/VP1 junction amplified by PCR directly from clinical specimens. The assay could amplify all HPeV types examined with high sensitivity (types 1 and 3 to 6) and also identified HPeV types in all but one of the screen-positive study specimens (25 HPeV1 and eight HPeV6 specimens). Infections with both HPeV1 and HPeV6 were seasonal, with highest frequencies in July and August, and restricted to children aged between 6 months and 5 years. Other respiratory viruses were frequently codetected in HPeV-positive specimens, with significant overrepresentation of adenovirus coinfections (37%). Most HPeV-positive specimens were referred from emergency departments, although no association with specific respiratory symptoms or disease was found. In summary, the low frequency of detection and lack of clear disease associations indicate that HPeV1 and -6 are not major pathogens in individuals presenting with respiratory disease. However, the screening and typing methods developed will be of value in further HPeV testing, including testing for meningitis cases and other suspected HPeV-associated disease presentations.","Harvala, H; Robertson, I; McWilliam Leitch, E C; Benschop, K; Wolthers, K C; Templeton, K; Simmonds, P",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.01207-08; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18753351/,192
131683,Causal Discovery using Compression-Complexity Measures.,2021-03-12,"Human behavior in an emergency situation is the starting point for all evacuation planning projects. A better understanding of the decisions made by the occupants during an emergency can help to develop calculation tools that can create more efficient forms of visual and audio communication and implement better procedures for evacuating people. The difficulty in studying human behavior lies in the very nature of emergencies, as they are unpredictable, somewhat exceptional and not reproducible. Fire drills play a role in training emergency teams and building occupants, but they cannot be used to collect real data on people's behavior unless the drill is so realistic that it could endanger the occupants' safety. In the procedure described here, through the use of a Virtual Reality device that encompasses all critical phases, including user characterization data before the virtual experience, building design parameters and fire scenario, key variables of human behavior can be recorded in order to evaluate each user's experience satisfactorily. This research shows that the average delay in starting an evacuation is greater than one minute, that anxiety levels and heart rates increase during a fire and that people do not pay attention to evacuation signals. Further analysis of the quantitative data may also provide the causes for decision-making. The use of devices that create realistic virtual environments is a solution for conducting ""what if"" tests to study and record the decisions taken by the users who undergo the experience in a way that is completely safe for them.","de Lama, Carlos; González-Gaya, Cristina; Sánchez-Lite, Alberto",Sensors,https://doi.org/10.3390/s20123607; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32604864/,192

Invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) infections are increasingly identified in homeless as a major contributor of morbidity and mortality. Very few countries have recommended pneumococcal vaccination programs for the homeless. AREAS COVERED A literature review of IPD in the homeless from 1980 to 2020 in PubMed and Scopus using terms, ""homeless,"" and ""homelessness,"" and after 'chronic' or 'transitory' homeless was conducted. Grey literature from the CDC, WHO and major governmental agencies/organizations were included. Terms for IPD eligible for inclusion in the database search included ""pneumococcal disease,"" ""invasive pneumococcal disease,"" ""Streptococcus pneumoniae"". This included outbreaks of pneumococcal disease in the homeless, clinical characteristics associated with pneumococcal disease in the homeless, pneumococcal vaccines and vaccination recommendations for the homeless. EXPERT OPINION Homeless populations are at increased risk for IPD in comparison to the general population. This is due to clinical conditions experienced by the homeless including alcoholism and cigarette smoking. In addition, a collection of specific pneumococcal serotypes are associated with IPD in this group. Pneumococcal vaccine programs aimed at this population would likely decrease the incidence of IPD for this group and contribute to better overall health for the homeless.","Tyrrell, Gregory J; Lee, Cerina; Eurich, Dean T",Expert review of vaccines,https://doi.org/10.1080/14760584.2021.1966301; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34365882/,192

METHODS From January 2011-April 2014, a total of 165 consecutive patients with gastric cancer underwent either intracorporeal Roux-en-Y esophagojejunostomy (n = 25) using the Orvil or extracorporeal circular anastomosis (n = 140) during LTG. After generating propensity scores with six covariates, including gender, age, body mass index (BMI), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, tumor location, and tumor size, 25 patients undergoing the OrVil method (intracorporeal group) were one-to-one matched with 25 patients undergoing the extracorporeal method (extracorporeal group). The short-term outcomes were compared between the two groups. RESULTS Both groups were balanced regarding baseline variables. The total operative time was not significantly different between the two groups (216.5 ± 24.9 min versus 224.0 ± 30.5 min, P = 0.344), whereas either the duration of anvil insertion (9.9 ± 2.4 min versus 12.9 ± 2.0 min, P < 0.001) or reconstruction completion (44.4 ± 9.4 min versus 50.1 ± 5.4 min, P = 0.012) in the intracorporeal group was less. The mean length of minilaparotomy in the intracorporeal group was shorter (5.6 ± 0.4 cm versus 7.2 ± 1.7 cm, P < 0.001). No significant differences were observed in intraoperative complication rate, estimated blood loss, length of proximal margin, or postoperative recovery course (including the time to first flatus, liquid resumption, liquid, and soft diet) between the two groups. No patients suffered from anastomosis-related complications. The overall morbidity rates of 28.0% in the intracorporeal group and 32.0% in the extracorporeal group were comparable (P = 0.758). CONCLUSIONS Intracorporeal Roux-en-Y esophagojejunostomy using the transorally inserted anvil system may be a safe procedure during LTG for gastric cancer.

Current methods of medical and post-graduate education in psychiatry worldwide have been inadequate in treating those with mental illness. Enormous gaps exist in provision of high-quality teaching, particularly in poorer countries with many having no access to ongoing teaching and training. RECENT FINDINGS Technology and changes to curriculum design have transformed student experiences and highlighted the value of online learning. There are many models to consider from and we describe the development process for these, which also highlight why some can be superior to classroom-based learning. New innovations have significantly enhanced engagement and reach thereby bringing students across the globe into an interconnected community and putting them in touch with world experts. Although some of these options may be expensive, many can be made affordable and accessible. SUMMARY It is possible to use innovations in online education to ensure high-quality teaching is available globally. A high touch model may be suitable when resources permit, and otherwise low touch scalable models provide options for increasing reach. Together, these models provide optimism for improving standards of global psychiatric training.","Jayaram, Mahesh; Shields, Greg; Buisman-Pijlman, Femke",Current opinion in psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1097/yco.0000000000000725; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34421112/,192

METHODS Data are from participants of the alteplase-dose arm of the randomized controlled trial, Enhanced Control of Hypertension and Thrombolysis Stroke Study (ENCHANTED). Associations between baseline characteristics of clinically defined supratentorial and infratentorial AIS patients and poor functional outcome, defined by scores 3-6 on the modified Rankin Scale, were evaluated in logistic regression models, with area under the curve (AUC) receiver operating characteristics defining the optimal NIHSS predictor cut point. RESULTS Patients with infratentorial AIS (n = 289) had lower baseline NIHSS scores than those with supratentorial AIS (n = 2,613) (median 7 vs 9; p < 0.001). NIHSS cut points for poor outcome were 10 (AUC 76, sensitivity 65%, specificity 73%) and 6 (AUC 69, sensitivity 72%, specificity 56%) in supratentorial and infratentorial AIS, respectively. There was no significant difference in functional outcome or symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage between AIS types. CONCLUSIONS In thrombolysis-eligible AIS patients, the NIHSS may underestimate clinical severity for infratentorial compared to supratentorial lesions for a similar prognosis for recovery. Because thrombolysis treatment has low effect on stroke outcome in patients with infratentorial AIS when baseline NIHSS score is more than 6, additional treatment such as endovascular treatment should be considered to improve stroke outcome.

OBJECTIVE This systematic review seeks to provide an overview of what technology is being used to test which outcomes in PD from free-living participant activity in the setting of the home environment. Additionally, this review seeks to form an impression of the nature of validation and clinimetric testing carried out on the technological device(s) being used. METHODS Five databases (Medline, Embase, PsycInfo, Cochrane and Web of Science) were systematically searched for papers dating from 2000. Study eligibility criteria included: adults with a PD diagnosis; the use of technology; the setting of a home or home-like environment; outcomes measuring any motor and non-motor aspect relevant to PD, as well as activities of daily living; unrestricted/unscripted activities undertaken by participants. RESULTS 65 studies were selected for data extraction. There were wide varieties of participant sample sizes (<10 up to hundreds) and study durations (<2 weeks up to a year). The metrics evaluated by technology, largely using inertial measurement units in wearable devices, included gait, tremor, physical activity, bradykinesia, dyskinesia and motor fluctuations, posture, falls, typing, sleep and activities of daily living. CONCLUSIONS Home-based free-living testing in PD is being conducted by multiple groups with diverse approaches, focussing mainly on motor symptoms and sleep.","Morgan, Catherine; Rolinski, Michal; McNaney, Roisin; Jones, Bennet; Rochester, Lynn; Maetzler, Walter; Craddock, Ian; Whone, Alan L",Journal of Parkinson's disease,https://doi.org/10.3233/jpd-191781; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32250314/,192

We hypothesized that removing soft callus will impair fracture healing, whereas reapplication will facilitate healing. METHODS A closed midshaft femur fracture was created in 78 rats and stabilized with an intramedullary wire. Seven days later, rats were equally divided and fractures surgically exposed. In the control group, no callus was removed, whereas in the callus removal group CR(-) group, the callus was removed and in the callus replaced group CR(+), callus was removed and replaced. Half of the rats were killed at 4 and 7 weeks. Fracture healing was graded with radiographs and callus volume measured with micro-CT. Mechanical torsion properties were measured, and histologic analysis was conducted. RESULTS At both end points, evidence of delayed healing was found on radiographs and micro-CT in CR(-) rats (P = 0.0001), whereas CR(+) rats showed normal fracture healing compared with controls. The normalized callus volume was similar in all groups at both end points. At 7 weeks, the maximum stiffness in CR(-) rats was 68% less than control (P = 0.0001). Stiffness increased 55% in CR(+) rats from CR(-) rats (P = 0.0017). Histology supported our findings with complete endochondral ossification in CR(+) rats but wide areas of hyaline cartilage in CR(-) rats at 7 weeks. CONCLUSIONS Removal of soft callus in a rat model delays fracture healing at early and late time points, whereas replacement mitigates these negative consequences. Replacing the soft callus should be considered in all osteosynthesis procedures.","Danoff, Jonathan R; Aurégan, Jean-Charles; Coyle, Ryan M; Burky, Robert E; Rosenwasser, Melvin P",Journal of orthopaedic trauma,https://doi.org/10.1097/bot.0000000000000481; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26544954/,192

We report a rare case of a recurrent AVM two years after complete resection in an adult patient. This case report shows that AVMs in adults can recur despite their rarity and despite postoperative angiography confirming complete removal.

134309,Decontamination of Bacillus subtilis var. niger spores on selected surfaces by chlorine dioxide gas.,2012,"BACKGROUND Lockdowns amid the COVID-19 pandemic have offered a real-world opportunity to better understand air quality responses to previously unseen anthropogenic emission reductions. METHODS AND MAIN OBJECTIVE This work examines the impact of Vienna's first lockdown on ground-level concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3) and total oxidant (Ox). The analysis runs over January to September 2020 and considers business as usual scenarios created with machine learning models to provide a baseline for robustly diagnosing lockdown-related air quality changes. Models were also developed to normalise the air pollutant time series, enabling facilitated intervention assessment. CORE FINDINGS NO2 concentrations were on average -20.1% [13.7-30.4%] lower during the lockdown. However, this benefit was offset by amplified O3 pollution of +8.5% [3.7-11.0%] in the same period. The consistency in the direction of change indicates that the NO2 reductions and O3 increases were ubiquitous over Vienna. Ox concentrations increased slightly by +4.3% [1.8-6.4%], suggesting that a significant part of the drops in NO2 was compensated by gains in O3. Accordingly, 82% of lockdown days with lowered NO2 were accompanied by 81% of days with amplified O3. The recovery shapes of the pollutant concentrations were depicted and discussed. The business as usual-related outcomes were broadly consistent with the patterns outlined by the normalised time series. These findings allowed to argue further that the detected changes in air quality were of anthropogenic and not of meteorological reason. Pollutant changes on the machine learning baseline revealed that the impact of the lockdown on urban air quality were lower than the raw measurements show. Besides, measured traffic drops in major Austrian roads were more significant for light-duty than for heavy-duty vehicles. It was also noted that the use of mobility reports based on cell phone movement as activity data can overestimate the reduction of emissions for the road transport sector, particularly for heavy-duty vehicles. As heavy-duty vehicles can make up a large fraction of the fleet emissions of nitrogen oxides, the change in the volume of these vehicles on the roads may be the main driver to explain the change in NO2 concentrations. INTERPRETATION AND IMPLICATIONS A probable future with emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) dropping slower than emissions of nitrogen oxides could risk worsened urban O3 pollution under a VOC-limited photochemical regime. More holistic policies will be needed to achieve improved air quality levels across different regions and criteria pollutants.","Brancher, Marlon",Environmental pollution,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2021.117153; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33940341/,192

METHODS NanoZolid-formulated EGF protein labelled with a near infrared dye (EGF-NIR) depots or EGF-NIR dissolved in PBS were injected subcutaneously into mice bearing EGF receptor (EGFR) positive human A549 lung cancer tumors inoculated subcutaneously. The release and biodistribution of the EGF-NIR were investigated in vivo longitudinally up to 96 hours post administration, utilizing whole body fluorescence imaging. In order to confirm the in vivo findings, histological analysis of tumor cryosections was performed to investigate EGF-NIR fluorescent signal and EGFR expression level by immunofluorescence labelling. RESULTS The in vivo fluorescence imaging showed a controlled release profile of the EGF-NIR loaded in the NanoZolid depots compared to free EGF-NIR. Histological analysis of the tumors further demonstrated a prevailing distribution of EGF-NIR in regions with high levels of EGFR expression. CONCLUSION Calcium sulfate based depots can be used to formulate EGF while maintaining its biological activity, e.g. receptor binding capability. This may have a good clinical potential for local delivery of biomolecules to enhance treatment efficacy and minimize systemic adverse effects.","Grudén, Stefan; Brunmark, Charlott; Holmqvist, Bo; Brenndörfer, Erwin D; Johansson, Martin; Liu, Jian; Zhao, Ying; Axén, Niklas; Hassan, Moustapha",International journal of pharmaceutics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpharm.2021.120588; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33845148/,192

However, the test is still described in clinical guidelines as an experimental test because of insufficient evidence. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will conduct a systematic review and a meta-analysis of diagnostic accuracy and management outcome studies involving patients evaluated with V/Q SPECT for suspected acute PE. We will search from inception to 19 December 2017 MEDLINE, Embase and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for diagnostic accuracy studies, randomised controlled trials and observational cohort studies. Two reviewers will conduct all screening and data collection independently. The methodological quality and risk of bias of eligible studies will be carefully and rigorously assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2, the Cochrane Collaboration's tool and the Risk Of Bias In Non-randomised Studies - of Interventions (ROBINS-I) tools. The primary outcomes will be sensitivity, specificity and likelihood ratios of V/Q SPECT for the diagnosis of acute PE. The secondary outcomes will be the rate of venous thromboembolism during a 3-month follow-up period in patients left untreated after a negative diagnostic work-up based on SPECT V/Q.

(3) Results: Immediately after the earthquake, almost 30% of the respondents assembled at the evacuation point. However, sequential steps of people's response were not observed: evacuation immediately after the earthquake was due to worry about the possibility of a tsunami, but this worry was not related to Natech damage estimation. The relevant factors for evacuation behavior were information access, worry about the possibility of a tsunami, and knowledge of groups and programs related to disaster risk reduction (DRR). The survey location (two villages), perceived earthquake risk, and DRR activity participation are less relevant to the behavior of assembling at the evacuation point.

Between January 2007 and December 2011, 16 patients (mean age, 72.8 years; age range 52-84 years; 10 men, six women) with HCC tumors less than 3 cm in diameter were included in the sorafenib-RFA group, and 136 patients (mean age, 72.1 years; age range, 51-86 years; 92 men, 44 women) with HCC tumors less than 3 cm in diameter were included in the RFA alone (control) group. Mean diameters of the greatest long-axis dimensions of HCC were 22.8 mm ± 4.6 (standard deviation) in the sorafenib-RFA group and 18.1 mm ± 4.4 in the control group. RFA was performed immediately after the 7-day administration of sorafenib. Propensity score matching analysis was used to adjust for potential biases. RESULTS Fifteen of the 16 patients in the sorafenib-RFA group and 30 of the 136 patients in the control group were selected during propensity score matching. No significant differences between the sorafenib-RFA group (n = 15) and the control group (n = 30) were observed with regard to age, sex, etiology, Child-Pugh class, tumor size, puncture number, needle size, location at the liver margin, or location adjacent to a main vessel. The respective mean diameters of the greatest long- and short-axis dimensions of the RFA-induced ablated area were 46.3 mm ± 10.3 and 33.0 mm ± 6.9 in the sorafenib-RFA group and 32.9 mm ± 7.6 and 25.6 mm ± 5.7 in the control group; both of these dimensions were significantly larger in the sorafenib-RFA group (both P < .001). CONCLUSION Sorafenib-RFA may be superior to standard RFA alone in the treatment of HCC tumors smaller than 3 cm in diameter.","Fukuda, Hiroyuki; Numata, Kazushi; Moriya, Satoshi; Shimoyama, Yu; Ishii, Tomohiro; Nozaki, Akito; Kondo, Masaaki; Morimoto, Manabu; Maeda, Shin; Sakamaki, Kentaro; Morita, Satoshi; Tanaka, Katsuaki",Radiology,https://doi.org/10.1148/radiol.14131640; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24689883/,192

A subset of these patients with resistant hypertension presents a particular management problem and suffers a marked increase in cardiovascular risk. Treatment options have been limited, but the past decade has witnessed the emergence of catheter-based renal denervation to interrupt the sympathetic nervous system, long considered to play an important role in the development and maintenance of hypertension. Phase 1 and 2 studies reported remarkable reductions in blood pressure and sparked an excessive exuberance that ground to a halt with negative results of the SYMPLICITY HTN-3 pivotal trial. The subsequent and sober reappraisal has shed light on potential failure modes. Armed with appropriately cautious optimism, the field has resumed its move forward to realize the potential for therapeutic application in hypertension and other conditions characterized by sympathetic overactivity. This article summarizes the rich experimental data, early surgical experience, and available clinical trial results for catheter platforms. It concludes with discussion of knowledge gaps, lessons learned, and future directions.","Raman, Venkatesh K; Tsioufis, Costas; Doumas, Michael; Papademetriou, Vasilios",Current treatment options in cardiovascular medicine,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11936-017-0536-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28455809/,192

136986,Preeclampsia-Pathophysiology and Clinical Presentations: JACC State-of-the-Art Review.,2020-10-06,"Muscular weakness and muscle wasting may often be observed in critically ill patients on intensive care units (ICUs) and may present as failure to wean from mechanical ventilation. Importantly, mounting data demonstrate that mechanical ventilation itself may induce progressive dysfunction of the main respiratory muscle, i.e. the diaphragm. The respective condition was termed 'ventilator-induced diaphragmatic dysfunction' (VIDD) and should be distinguished from peripheral muscular weakness as observed in 'ICU-acquired weakness (ICU-AW)'. Interestingly, VIDD and ICU-AW may often be observed in critically ill patients with, e.g. severe sepsis or septic shock, and recent data demonstrate that the pathophysiology of these conditions may overlap. VIDD may mainly be characterized on a histopathological level as disuse muscular atrophy, and data demonstrate increased proteolysis and decreased protein synthesis as important underlying pathomechanisms. However, atrophy alone does not explain the observed loss of muscular force. When, e.g. isolated muscle strips are examined and force is normalized for cross-sectional fibre area, the loss is disproportionally larger than would be expected by atrophy alone. Nevertheless, although the exact molecular pathways for the induction of proteolytic systems remain incompletely understood, data now suggest that VIDD may also be triggered by mechanisms including decreased diaphragmatic blood flow or increased oxidative stress. Here we provide a concise review on the available literature on respiratory muscle weakness and VIDD in the critically ill. Potential underlying pathomechanisms will be discussed before the background of current diagnostic options. Furthermore, we will elucidate and speculate on potential novel future therapeutic avenues.","Berger, David; Bloechlinger, Stefan; von Haehling, Stephan; Doehner, Wolfram; Takala, Jukka; Z'Graggen, Werner J; Schefold, Joerg C","Journal of cachexia, sarcopenia and muscle",https://doi.org/10.1002/jcsm.12108; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27030815/,192

Here, we describe the process of developing a SARS-Cov2 diagnostic workflow in a conventional academic Containment Level 2 laboratory. Our outline includes simple SARS-Cov2 deactivation upon contact, the method for a quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase PCR detecting SARS-Cov2, a description of process establishment and validation, and some considerations for establishing a similar workflow elsewhere. This was achieved under challenging circumstances through the collaborative efforts of scientists, clinical staff, and diagnostic staff to mitigate to the ongoing crisis.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Cross-sectional associations of AT-IR with fat mass and distribution, and IR-related cardiometabolic variables were examined in 210 young and 148 middle-aged women whose average body mass index (BMI) was <23 kg/m2 and waist was <80 cm. Multivariate linear regression analyses were used to identify most important determinants of AT-IR. RESULTS Young and middle-aged women did not differ in AT-IR (3.5±2.7 and 3.2±2.1, respectively). In both young and middle-aged women, AT-IR was positively associated with trunk/leg fat ratio, a sophisticated measure of abdominal fat accumulation, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), fasting triglycerides (FTG), serum alanine aminotransferase and γ-glutamyl-transpeptidase (all p<0.05). Furthermore, in middle-aged but not in young women, AT-IR showed positive associations with BMI, waist, fat mass index, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoprotein B and systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) (all p<0.05). AT-IR showed no association with hemoglobin A1c, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and apolipoprotein A1 in two groups of women. On multivariate analysis including waist, FPG, FTG, HDL cholesterol and systolic BP as independent variables, FPG, FTG and HDL cholesterol emerged as independent determinants of AT-IR in young women (cumulative R2=0.141) and waist in middle-aged women (cumulative R2=0.056). In a model which included trunk/leg fat ratio instead of waist, trunk/leg fat ratio and systolic BP were determinants of AT-IR in middle-aged women (cumulative R2=0.093). Results did not alter in young women. CONCLUSIONS AT-IR may be a simple and useful surrogate index of adipose tissue insulin resistance even in populations without diabetes and obesity.","Kitaoka, Kaori; Tsuboi, Ayaka; Minato-Inokawa, Satomi; Honda, Mari; Takeuchi, Mika; Yano, Megumu; Kurata, Miki; Wu, Bin; Kazumi, Tsutomu; Fukuo, Keisuke",BMJ open diabetes research & care,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjdrc-2020-001686; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32900700/,192

137565,HeartMath Coherence Model Throws New Light on Arka Dhyana Intuitive Meditation.,2021-09-05,"Specific structures in mRNA can stimulate programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF). PRF efficiency can vary enormously between different stimulatory structures, but the features that lead to efficient PRF stimulation remain uncertain. To address this question, we studied the structural dynamics of the frameshift signal from West Nile virus (WNV), which stimulates -1 PRF at very high levels and has been proposed to form several different structures, including mutually incompatible pseudoknots and a double hairpin. Using optical tweezers to apply tension to single mRNA molecules, mimicking the tension applied by the ribosome during PRF, we found that the WNV frameshift signal formed an unusually large number of different metastable structures, including all of those previously proposed. From force-extension curve measurements, we mapped 2 mutually exclusive pathways for the folding, each encompassing multiple intermediates. We identified the intermediates in each pathway from length changes and the effects of antisense oligomers blocking formation of specific contacts. Intriguingly, the number of transitions between the different conformers of the WNV frameshift signal was maximal in the range of forces applied by the ribosome during -1 PRF. Furthermore, the occupancy of the pseudoknotted conformations was far too low for static pseudoknots to account for the high levels of -1 PRF. These results support the hypothesis that conformational heterogeneity plays a key role in frameshifting and suggest that transitions between different conformers under tension are linked to efficient PRF stimulation.","Halma, Matthew T J; Ritchie, Dustin B; Cappellano, Tonia R; Neupane, Krishna; Woodside, Michael T",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1905258116; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31409714/,192

The possible use of protective mAbs directed against different microbial pathogens is currently being considered. The fine definition of the epitope recognized by a protective mAb is an important aspect to be considered for possible development in epitope-based vaccinology. The most accurate approach to this is the X-ray resolution of mAb/antigen crystal complex. Unfortunately, this approach is not always feasible. Under this perspective, several surrogate epitope mapping strategies based on the use of bioinformatics have been developed.

138236,The isolated zoologist.,2020-10-23,"BACKGROUND Biofilm on the surface of endotracheal tubes (ETTs) is associated with ventilator-associated pneumonia. The use of silver-coated ETTs has been suggested to reduce the occurrence of ventilator-associated pneumonia by preventing biofilm formation. However, mucus accumulation can reduce the antibacterial activity of silver-coated ETTs by isolating bacterial colonies from the silver surface. We hypothesized that, in mechanically ventilated subjects, periodic removal of secretions through the use of a cleaning device would enhance the antimicrobial properties of silver-coated ETTs and thus reduce bacterial colonization. METHODS Subjects were randomized to either standard suctioning (blind tracheal suctioning, control group) or blind tracheal suctioning plus cleaning maneuver every 8 h (treatment group). Tracheal aspirates were collected immediately before extubation for microbiological culture. After extubation, ETTs were collected for both cultural and non-cultural microbiological analysis and biofilm isolation. RESULTS 39 subjects expected to be ventilated for > 48 h were enrolled; 36 ETTs (18 control, 18 treatment) and 29 tracheal samples (15 control, 14 treatment) were collected. Among the ETTs positive for bacterial colonization (15 vs 9, P = .18), cleaning maneuvers did not reduce microbial load, shown as the decimal logarithm of colony-forming units (CFU) per mL (1.6 ± 1.2 vs 0.9 ± 1.2 logCFU/mL, P = .15). There was a trend toward decreased biofilm deposition (439.5 ± 29.0 vs 288.9 ± 157.7 mg, P = .09) in the treated ETTs. No significant differences were observed in the number of positive tracheal aspirates (13 vs 10, P = .39) or in the microbial load (4.8 ± 4.0 vs 4.2 ± 3.8 logCFU/mL, P = .70) of tracheal secretions. Finally, no differences in the microbial load of Gram-positive organisms, Gram-negative organisms, or yeasts were found between the ETTs and tracheal aspirates of the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS In 39 critically-ill subjects intubated with silver-coated ETTs, periodic cleaning maneuvers did not decrease bacterial colonization of the ETTs and did not lower respiratory tract colonization compared to the standard suctioning.

Still, the goals are consistent: to improve patient experience, lower costs, reduce risk, and provide insights into a wide range of care and management issues. Most health systems face similar challenges, such as margin enhancement, quality improvement, increased access, and fending off disruptive competition. Systemness is a way to address these challenges while improving the overall interdependence of the organization. Although embraced by and advantageous to healthcare organizations, systemness efforts often fail. The obstacles are surmountable when organizations thoroughly analyze the achievable scale of systemness, community resources, and current mindset regarding the good of the whole. Leaders must play a vital role in promoting systemness by providing education and a routine review of day-to-day organizational activities. Sometimes, systemness requires a change in leadership or an updating of leadership skills.Organizations must recognize and assess their culture as it relates to principles of independence versus interdependence, and refocus clinical standardization through best-practice protocols and policies as COVID-19 affects the already-fractured healthcare sector. Fortunately, current and developing artificial intelligence, wearables, at-home testing, and improved technologies promise to provide a needed break for a contracting physician field and fatigued front line, and they present an opportunity for those organizations poised to meet the systemness challenge.","Stokes, Charles D; Brace, Rod",Frontiers of health services management,https://doi.org/10.1097/hap.0000000000000110; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34036947/,192

There is good evidence that ACE2 is a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, and high expression of ACE2 may increase susceptibility to infection. We aimed to explore risk factors affecting susceptibility to infection and prioritize drug repositioning candidates, based on Mendelian randomization (MR) studies on ACE2 lung expression. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We conducted a phenome-wide MR study to prioritize diseases/traits and blood proteins causally linked to ACE2 lung expression in GTEx. We also explored drug candidates whose targets overlapped with the top-ranked proteins in MR, as these drugs may alter ACE2 expression and may be clinically relevant. RESULTS The most consistent finding was tentative evidence of an association between diabetes-related traits and increased ACE2 expression. Based on one of the largest genome-wide association studies on type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) to date (N = 898,130), T2DM was causally linked to raised ACE2 expression (P = 2.91E-03; MR-IVW). Significant associations (at nominal level; P < 0.05) with ACE2 expression were observed across multiple diabetes data sets and analytic methods for T1DM, T2DM, and related traits including early start of insulin. Other diseases/traits having nominal significant associations with increased expression included inflammatory bowel disease, (estrogen receptor-positive) breast cancer, lung cancer, asthma, smoking, and elevated alanine aminotransferase. We also identified drugs that may target the top-ranked proteins in MR, such as fostamatinib and zinc. CONCLUSIONS Our analysis suggested that diabetes and related traits may increase ACE2 expression, which may influence susceptibility to infection (or more severe infection). However, none of these findings withstood rigorous multiple testing corrections (at false discovery rate <0.05). Proteome-wide MR analyses might help uncover mechanisms underlying ACE2 expression and guide drug repositioning.

Anorectal manometry and defecography are often used to make this diagnosis. However, these tests are expensive and require expertise. Balloon expulsion testing may be a simple alternative. We compared balloon expulsion to anorectal manometry and defecography for diagnosing dyssynergia in women with chronic constipation. METHODS We conducted a retrospective review. All women presenting for evaluation of chronic constipation who underwent concurrent balloon testing, manometry, and defecography were included. A diagnosis of dyssynergic defecation was established by either defecography revealing prolonged/incomplete rectal evacuation and/or by manometry revealing paradoxical contraction/inadequate relaxation of the pelvic floor. Inability to expel a 50-ml balloon defined dyssynergic defecation by balloon testing. Sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values were calculated. RESULTS A total of 61 women met inclusion criteria. Mean age was 50 years. There were 36 women (59 %) who met Rome III criteria for dyssynergic defecation on defecography and/or manometry. Only 12 of these 36 (33 %) were similarly diagnosed by balloon testing. The sensitivity and positive predictive value of balloon testing for dyssynergia were 33 and 71 %, respectively. Of the 25 (41 %) women who did not meet Rome III criteria for dyssynergia on defecography and/or manometry, 20 (80 %) also had negative balloon testing. Thus, the specificity and negative predictive value of balloon testing for diagnosing dyssynergia were 80 and 50 %, respectively. CONCLUSIONS In our population, balloon expulsion was not an ideal screening test for dyssynergic defecation in women with constipation. Multimodal testing is necessary for more accurate diagnosis.","Kassis, Nadine C; Wo, John M; James-Stevenson, Toyia N; Maglinte, Dean D T; Heit, Michael H; Hale, Douglass S",International urogynecology journal,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00192-015-2722-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26085464/,192
141384,Comment on: Novel approaches to surgical trials and the assessment of new surgical technologies.,2021-03-12,"Due to the rapidly spreading of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) worldwide, there is an urgent need to develop efficient vaccines and specific antiviral treatments. Pathways of the viral entry into cells are interesting subjects for targeted therapy of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The present study aims to provide a systematic evaluation of the most recent in vitro and in vivo investigations targeting SARS-CoV-2 cell entry. A systematic search was carried out in major medical sources, including MEDLINE (through PubMed), Web of Science, Scopus, and EMBASE. Combinations of the following search terms were used: SARS-CoV-2, in vitro, in vivo, preclinical, targeted therapy, and cell entry. A modified version of the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials and Systematic Review Centre for Laboratory Animal Experimentation assessment tools were applied for evaluating the risk of bias of in vitro and in vivo studies, respectively. A narrative synthesis was performed as a qualitative method for the data synthesis of each outcome measure. A total of 2,649 articles were identified through searching PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, EMBASE, Google Scholar, and Biorxiv. Finally, 22 studies (one in vivo study and 21 in vitro studies) were included. The spike (S) glycoprotein of the SARS-CoV-2 was the main target of investigation in 19 studies. SARS-CoV-2 can enter into the host cells through endocytosis or independently. SARS-CoV-2 S protein utilizes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 or CD147 as its cell-surface receptor to attach host cells. It consists of S1 and S2 subunits. The S1 subunit mediates viral attachment to the host cells, while the S2 subunit facilitates virus-host membrane fusion. The cleavage of the S1-S2 protein, which is required for the conformational changes of the S2 subunit and processing of viral fusion, is regulated by the host proteases, including cathepsin L (during endocytosis) and type II membrane serine protease (independently). Targeted therapy strategies against SARS-CoV-2 cell entry mechanisms fall into four main categories: strategies targeting virus receptors on the host, strategies neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, strategies targeting virus fusion to host cells, and strategies targeting endosomal and non-endosomal dependent pathways of virus entry. Inhibition of the viral entry by targeting host or virus-related components remains the most potent strategy to prevent and treat COVID-19. Further high-quality investigations are needed to assess the efficacy of the proposed targets and develop specific antivirals against SARS-CoV-2.","Seyedpour, Simin; Khodaei, Behzad; Loghman, Amir H; Seyedpour, Nasrin; Kisomi, Misagh F; Balibegloo, Maryam; Nezamabadi, Sasan S; Gholami, Bahareh; Saghazadeh, Amene; Rezaei, Nima",Journal of cellular physiology,https://doi.org/10.1002/jcp.30032; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32901936/,192

143185,A Custom-made Pupillometer System for Characterizing Pupillary Light Response.,2018,"BACKGROUND Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a noninvasive technique that allows continuous monitoring of the regional hemoglobin oxygen saturation (rSO(2)) index. We evaluated its application to survey perioperative lower limb perfusion. METHODS A total of 10 patients (7 men, aged 71) were monitored during abdominal surgery for aortic aneurysms. The rSO(2) index was measured at the M gastrocnemius (optode 1) and at the dorsum of the foot (optode 2). RESULTS Mean baseline rSO(2) values for optodes 1 and 2 were 67 and 66, respectively. After clamping the aorta or iliacofemoral arteries, rSO(2) dropped to 32 for optode 1 (P<.0001) and to 27 for optode 2 (P<.0001). After declamping, rSO(2) increased to 74 for optode 1 (P=.0012 vs baseline) and also to 74 for optode 2 (P=.0018 vs baseline). CONCLUSION Near-infrared spectroscopy is an easily applicable, noninvasive tool for continuous surveillance of lower extremity perfusion during aortic reconstruction.","Boezeman, R P E; Kelder, J C; Waanders, F G J; de Vries, J P P M",Vascular and endovascular surgery,https://doi.org/10.1177/1538574411406746; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21646238/,192

143850,Omental Infarction: The Great Impersonator.,2017,"OBJECTIVES Registry data suggest that people with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) receiving targeted systemic therapies have fewer adverse COVID-19 outcomes compared to patients receiving no systemic treatments. We used international patient survey data to explore the hypothesis that greater risk-mitigating behaviour in those receiving targeted therapies may account, at least in part, for this observation. METHODS Online surveys were completed by individuals with psoriasis (globally) or Rheumatic and Musculoskeletal Diseases (RMD) (UK only) between 4th May and 7th September 2020. We used multiple logistic regression to assess the association between treatment type and risk-mitigating behaviour, adjusting for clinical and demographic characteristics. We characterised international variation in a mixed effects model. RESULTS Of 3,720 participants (2,869 psoriasis, 851 RMD) from 74 countries, 2,262 (60.8%) reported the most stringent risk-mitigating behaviour (classified here under the umbrella term 'shielding'). A greater proportion of those receiving targeted therapies (biologics and JAK inhibitors) reported shielding compared to those receiving no systemic therapy (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.63, 95% CI 1.35-1.97) and standard systemic agents (OR 1.39, 95% CI 1.22-1.56). Shielding was associated with established risk factors for severe COVID-19 (male sex [OR 1.14, 95% CI 1.05-1.24], obesity [OR 1.38, 95% CI 1.23-1.54], comorbidity burden [OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.15-1.78]), a primary indication of RMD (OR 1.37, 95% CI 1.27-1.48) and a positive anxiety or depression screen (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.36-1.80). Modest differences in the proportion shielding were observed across nations. CONCLUSIONS Greater risk-mitigating behaviour among people with IMIDs receiving targeted therapies may contribute to the reported lower risk of adverse COVID-19 outcomes. The behaviour variation across treatment groups, IMIDs and nations reinforces the need for clear evidence-based patient communication on risk mitigation strategies and may help inform updated public health guidelines as the pandemic continues.","Mahil, S K; Yates, M; Langan, S M; Yiu, Z Z N; Tsakok, T; Dand, N; Mason, K J; McAteer, H; Meynell, F; Coker, B; Vincent, A; Urmston, D; Vesty, A; Kelly, J; Lancelot, C; Moorhead, L; Bachelez, H; Bruce, I N; Capon, F; Contreras, C R; Cope, A P; De La Cruz, C; Di Meglio, P; Gisondi, P; Hyrich, K; Jullien, D; Lambert, J; Marzo-Ortega, H; McKinnes, I; Naldi, L; Norton, S; Puig, L; Sengupta, R; Spuls, P; Torres, T; Warren, R B; Waweru, H; Weinman, J; Griffiths, C M; Barker, J N; Brown, M A; Galloway, J B; Smith, C H",The British journal of dermatology,https://doi.org/10.1111/bjd.19755; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33368145/,192

144900,"Effects of Human, Caprine, and Bovine Milk Fat Globules on Microbiota Adhesion and Gut Microecology.",2021-08-09,"SARS-CoV-2 mortality has been extensively studied in relation to host susceptibility. How sequence variations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome affect pathogenicity is poorly understood. Starting in October 2020, using the methodology of genome-wide association studies (GWAS), we looked at the association between whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data of the virus and COVID-19 mortality as a potential method of early identification of highly pathogenic strains to target for containment. Although continuously updating our analysis, in December 2020, we analyzed 7548 single-stranded SARS-CoV-2 genomes of COVID-19 patients in the GISAID database and associated variants with mortality using a logistic regression. In total, evaluating 29,891 sequenced loci of the viral genome for association with patient/host mortality, two loci, at 12,053 and 25,088 bp, achieved genome-wide significance (p values of 4.09e-09 and 4.41e-23, respectively), though only 25,088 bp remained significant in follow-up analyses. Our association findings were exclusively driven by the samples that were submitted from Brazil (p value of 4.90e-13 for 25,088 bp). The mutation frequency of 25,088 bp in the Brazilian samples on GISAID has rapidly increased from about 0.4 in October/December 2020 to 0.77 in March 2021. Although GWAS methodology is suitable for samples in which mutation frequencies varies between geographical regions, it cannot account for mutation frequencies that change rapidly overtime, rendering a GWAS follow-up analysis of the GISAID samples that have been submitted after December 2020 as invalid. The locus at 25,088 bp is located in the P.1 strain, which later (April 2021) became one of the distinguishing loci (precisely, substitution V1176F) of the Brazilian strain as defined by the Centers for Disease Control. Specifically, the mutations at 25,088 bp occur in the S2 subunit of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, which plays a key role in viral entry of target host cells. Since the mutations alter amino acid coding sequences, they potentially imposing structural changes that could enhance viral infectivity and symptom severity. Our analysis suggests that GWAS methodology can provide suitable analysis tools for the real-time detection of new more transmissible and pathogenic viral strains in databases such as GISAID, though new approaches are needed to accommodate rapidly changing mutation frequencies over time, in the presence of simultaneously changing case/control ratios. Improvements of the associated metadata/patient information in terms of quality and availability will also be important to fully utilize the potential of GWAS methodology in this field.","Hahn, Georg; Wu, Chloe M; Lee, Sanghun; Lutz, Sharon M; Khurana, Surender; Baden, Lindsey R; Haneuse, Sebastien; Qiao, Dandi; Hecker, Julian; DeMeo, Dawn L; Tanzi, Rudolph E; Choudhary, Manish C; Etemad, Behzad; Mohammadi, Abbas; Esmaeilzadeh, Elmira; Cho, Michael H; Li, Jonathan Z; Randolph, Adrienne G; Laird, Nan M; Weiss, Scott T; Silverman, Edwin K; Ribbeck, Katharina; Lange, Christoph",Genetic epidemiology,https://doi.org/10.1002/gepi.22421; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34159627/,192
145209,Difficulties of delivering urological care to remote areas.,2021-04-01,"Fingolimod is a first-in-class of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator and is widely used a therapeutic drug for multiple sclerosis (MS), autoimmune disease in the central nervous system. About 25 year ago, a natural product, myriocin was isolated from culture broths of the fungus Isaria sinclairii. Myriocin, a rather complex amino acid having three successive asymmetric centers, was found to show a potent immunosuppressive activity in vitro; however, it induced a strong toxicity in vivo. To find out a less toxic immunosuppressive candidate, the chemical structure of myriocin was simplified to a nonchiral symmetric 2-substituted-2-aminoproane-1,3-diol framework. Finally, a highly potent immunosuppressant, fingolimod was found by the extensive chemical modification and pharmacological evaluation using skin allograft model in vivo. Throughout the analyses of the mechanism action of fingolimod, it is revealed that S1P receptor 1 (S1P1) plays an essential role in lymphocyte circulation and that the molecular target of fingolimod is S1P1. Phosphorylated fingolimod acts as a ""functional"" antagonist at S1P1, modulates lymphocyte circulation, and shows a potent immunosuppressive activity. Fingolimod significantly reduced the relapse rate of MS in the clinical studies and has been approved as a new therapeutic drug for MS in more than 80 countries.","Chiba, Kenji",The Journal of antibiotics,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41429-020-0351-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32681100/,192

However, the accuracy of the BSR compared with direct visualization of the EEG trace with regard to the prediction of POD has not been evaluated previously. Methods Forty-one consecutive patients undergoing non-cardiac, non-intracranial surgery with general anaesthesia wore a SedLine ® monitor during surgery and were assessed after surgery for the presence of delirium with the Confusion Assessment Method. The intraoperative EEG was scanned for absolute minutes of EEG suppression and correlated with the incidence of POD. The BSR and PSI™ were compared between patients with and without POD. Results Visual analysis of the EEG by neurologists and the SedLine ® -generated BSR provided a significantly different distribution of estimated minutes of EEG suppression ( P =0.037). The Sedline ® system markedly underestimated the amount of EEG suppression. The number of minutes of suppression assessed by visual analysis of the EEG was significantly associated with POD ( P =0.039), whereas the minutes based on the BSR generated by SedLine ® were not associated with POD ( P =0.275). Conclusions Our findings suggest that SedLine ® (machine)-generated indices might underestimate the minutes of EEG suppression, thereby reducing the sensitivity for detecting patients at risk for POD. Thus, the monitoring of machine-generated BSR and PSI™ might benefit from the addition of a visual tracing of the EEG to achieve a more accurate and real-time guidance of anaesthesia depth monitoring and the ultimate goal, to reduce the risk of POD.","Muhlhofer, W G; Zak, R; Kamal, T; Rizvi, B; Sands, L P; Yuan, M; Zhang, X; Leung, J M",British journal of anaesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1093/bja/aex054; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28486575/,192

This virus can infect both animals and people and cause illnesses of the respiratory tract. WHO has declared Coronavirus as pandemic and the whole world is fighting against Coronavirus. Globally, more than 199,478 people have been diagnosed with COVID-19. As of March 18, 2020, more than 167 countries have been affected and more than 8000 deaths have been reported. The main country being affected is China followed by Italy, Iran, Spain, France, and the USA. MATERIALS AND METHODS Since there are no effective drugs available against Coronavirus, we conducted virtual screening of phytochemicals to find novel compounds against this virus. Hence, we created a phytochemical library of 318 phytochemicals from 11 plants which have been reported as antiviral, antibacterial and antifungal activity. The phytochemical library was subjected to virtual screening against molecular targets; Main protease (Mpro) and Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2). RESULTS Top 10 compounds were selected from each target which had better and significantly low binding energy as compared to the reference molecule.

Methods We designed a Milestone-based curriculum of 10 emergency department clinical cases and used Slack to implement it. An instructor was appointed for each participating institution to lead the discussion and encourage collaboration among preinterns. Pre- and postcurriculum surveys utilized 20 statements adapted from the eight applicable Milestones to measure the evolution of preintern self-reported perceived preparedness (PP) as well as actual clinical knowledge (CK) performance on a case-based examination. Results A total of 11 institutions collaborated and 151 preinterns were contacted, 127 of whom participated. After participating in the Slack intern curriculum (SIC), preinterns reported significant improvements in PP regarding multiple Milestone topics. They also showed improved CK regarding the airway management Milestone based on examination performance. Conclusions Implementation of our SIC may ease the difficult transition between medical school and internship for emergency medicine preinterns. Residency leadership and medical school faculty will benefit from knowledge of preintern PP, specifically of their perceived strengths and weaknesses, because this information can guide curricular focus at the end of medical school and beginning of internship. Limitations of this study include variable participation and a high attrition rate. Further studies will address the utility of such a virtual curriculum for preinterns and for rotating medical students who have been displaced from clinical rotations during the novel coronavirus pandemic.","McLean, Mary E; Huls, Thomas A; Cotarelo, Adrian A; Husain, Abbas; Park, Joel C; Chan, Jonathan C; So, Elizabeth S; Anana, Michael C; Chen, Angela S; Chien, Gordon K; Chung, Arlene S; Cygan, Lukasz D; Gupta, Suman J; Kanter, Marc P; Lee, Eric; Mishra, Diksha; Ng, Kristen M; Restivo, Andrew J; Russell, James T; Shah, Kaushal; Surles, R Taylor; Kulkarni, Miriam L",AEM education and training,https://doi.org/10.1002/aet2.10503; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33898907/,192

149368,"New year, new outbreak.",2020-12-01,"Chemotherapy is intended to induce cancer cell death through apoptosis and other avenues. Unfortunately, as discussed in this article, moderate doses of genotoxic drugs such as cisplatin typical of those achieved in the clinic often invoke a cytostatic/dormancy rather than cytotoxic/apoptosis response in solid tumour-derived cell lines. This is commonly manifested by an extended apoptotic threshold, with extensive apoptosis only being seen after very high/supralethal doses of such agents. The dormancy response can be associated with senescence-like features, polyploidy and/or multinucleation, depending in part on the p53 status of the cells. In most solid tumour-derived cells, dormancy represents a long-term survival mechanism, ultimately contributing to disease recurrence. This review highlights the nonlinearity of key aspects of the molecular and cellular responses to bulky DNA lesions in human cells treated with chemotherapeutic drugs (e.g., cisplatin) or ultraviolet light-C (a widely used tool for unraveling details of the DNA damage-response) as a function of the level of genotoxic stress. Such data highlight the growing realization that targeting dormant cancer cells, which frequently emerge following conventional anticancer treatments, may represent a novel strategy to prevent or, at least, significantly suppress cancer recurrence.","Murray, David; Mirzayans, Razmik",International journal of molecular sciences,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21165766; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32796711/,192
149402,Innovative Medicines Initiative plays the long game on research funding.,2021-02-01,"This work monitored the effect of ripening and variety on the physiochemical quality and flavor of fermented Chinese chili pepper (Paojiao). Three commercial varieties of chili pepper (Capsicum frutescens Linn.) at three ripening stages were selected. Physiochemical quality (color, texture, and vitamin C) and flavor properties [capsaicinoids, free amino acid (FAA), and aroma] were determined and compared by multivariate data analysis. The hardness and chewiness decreased, while the contents of vitamin C, capsaicin, and taste-active FAAs increased in Paojiao with ripening. More volatiles were found in green peppers. Fingerprinting and multivariate data analysis revealed that ester, aldehydes, and terpenes were discriminant volatiles that significantly changed in Paojiao during ripening. In general, ripening and variety greatly affect the physiochemical and flavor quality of peppers and their effects intensify after fermentation.","Ye, Zi; Shang, Zhixun; Li, Meiqi; Zhang, Xuetin; Ren, Hongbing; Hu, Xiaosong; Yi, Junjie",Food chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.130797; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34399178/,192
149870,"Fabrication, characterizations and performance of a high-efficiency micro-electrolysis filler for isobutyl xanthate (IBX) degradation.",2020-08-13,"BACKGROUND The components separation technique (CST) is performed through an open or endoscopic approach. It is unclear whether the costs associated with the endoscopic instruments outweigh any clinical benefit derived from their use and the avoidance of lipocutaneous flaps. This study aimed to compare the direct costs associated with each approach. METHODS A retrospective review of patients undergoing open or endoscopic CST between 2005 and 2009 was performed. The review compared patient-related variables, length of hospital stay, wound morbidity, and costs associated with the index operation and encounters within a 6-month period. RESULTS Of the 54 patients identified, 59% underwent endoscopic repair, and 41% had an open CST repair. The patients were similar in age, American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) score, gender, body mass index (BMI), number of prior surgeries, active abdominal infection, defect size, operating room time, and length of hospital stay. The overall median direct costs were similar between endoscopic and open CST ($9,942 vs. $17,701; p = 0.09). No difference was detected in median operating room costs, but an approximate $7,000 difference was noted between endoscopic and open CST ($1,871 vs. $8,705; p = 0.96). The median mesh costs differed significantly between endoscopic and open CST ($733 vs. $8,415; p = 0.05) as did stapler use costs ($35 vs. $190; p = 0.002). The median cost of endoscopic instruments was $848. Open CST had a 41% major wound morbidity rate compared with 19% in the endoscopic group (p = 0.07). Most of the encounters in the 6-month follow-up period (85%) were related to wound morbidity. The median cumulative direct costs differed between endoscopic and open CST at 3 and 6 months ($12,528 vs. $20,326; p = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS In a similarly complex group of patients, the total direct costs associated with endoscopic and open CST were similar. Endoscopic instruments made a marginal contribution to the total overall costs, but significant cost contributors were the use of biologic grafts and wound morbidity.","Harth, Karem C; Rose, Johnie; Delaney, Conor P; Blatnik, Jeffrey A; Halaweish, Ihab; Rosen, Michael J",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-010-1526-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21638192/,192
150053,Application in a biomonitoring context of three-spined stickleback immunomarker reference ranges.,2021-08-02,"The authors conducted a scoping review to investigate the structure, content, and potential impact of post-residency medical education fellowships. The authors searched eight databases to identify English-language articles describing longitudinal, post-residency medical fellowships that both focused on medical education and described the structure and content of the curriculum. The authors summarized the findings of each article and, for those articles that included a program evaluation, assessed the potential impact of the program via the Kirkpatrick's Four-Level Training Evaluation Model and the Medical Education Research Study Quality Instrument. Nine articles, describing a total of ten post-residency medical education fellowships, met inclusion criteria. Half of the programs were dedicated medical education fellowships and half were medical education tracks within a subspecialty fellowship. The content and educational strategies varied, with no two programs having the same curriculum. Most programs most focused on teaching skills, adult learning theory, curricular development, and medical education research/scholarship. Most programs used project-based learning, workshops, and faculty mentorship as educational strategies. Six of the articles included an evaluation of their program(s), all of which suggested positive changes, at least at the level of fellow behavior (Kirkpatrick level 3), and designs limited the strength of any conclusions drawn. This scoping review highlights the variation among medical education fellowships and the need for common curricular components, as well as program evaluation, across and within these fellowships. Additional assessment at higher levels of trainee outcomes will help guide the creation and revision of medical education fellowships, and inform the development of a core curriculum shared across programs. Such a core curriculum could then serve as the foundation for a certification program, by which a medical educator's expertise could be recognized, thus elevating medical education to the stature it deserves within the academic mission.","Cataldi, Mariel L; Kelly-Hedrick, Margot; Nanavati, Julie; Chisolm, Margaret S; Anne L, Walsh",Medical education online,https://doi.org/10.1080/10872981.2021.1920084; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33970808/,192

DATA SOURCES MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane CENTRAL were searched using a combination of related MeSH terms and keywords. STUDY SELECTION Cohort studies and case controls investigating common anesthetic and critical care aerosol-generating procedures and transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 to healthcare workers were included for quantitative analysis. DATA EXTRACTION Qualitative and quantitative data on the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus to healthcare workers via aerosol-generating procedures in anesthesia and critical care were collected independently. The Risk Of Bias In Non-randomized Studies - of Interventions tool was used to assess the risk of bias of included studies. DATA SYNTHESIS Seventeen studies out of 2,676 yielded records were included for meta-analyses. Endotracheal intubation (odds ratio, 6.69, 95% CI, 3.81-11.72; p < 0.001), noninvasive ventilation (odds ratio, 3.65; 95% CI, 1.86-7.19; p < 0.001), and administration of nebulized medications (odds ratio, 10.03; 95% CI, 1.98-50.69; p = 0.005) were found to increase the odds of healthcare workers contracting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. The use of N95 masks (odds ratio, 0.11; 95% CI, 0.03-0.39; p < 0.001), gowns (odds ratio, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.48-0.73; p < 0.001), and gloves (odds ratio, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.29-0.53; p < 0.001) were found to be significantly protective of healthcare workers from contracting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.

150845,Electrochemical and biological characterization of thin-film platinum-iridium alloy electrode coatings: a chronic in vivo study.,2020-05-14,"BACKGROUND The generation of excessive inspiratory muscle pressure (Pmus) during assisted mechanical ventilation in patients with respiratory failure may result in acute respiratory muscle injury and/or fatigue, and exacerbate ventilator-induced lung injury. A readily available noninvasive surrogate measure of Pmus may help in titrating both mechanical ventilation and sedation to minimize these risks. This bench study explored the feasibility and accuracy of using a ventilator's expiratory pause hold function to measure Pmus across multiple operators. METHODS A standardized technique for executing a brief (<1 s) expiratory pause maneuver was used to measure the airway occlusion pressure change (Δ Paw) by using 3 simulated Pmus (Δ Pmus: 5, 10, 15 cm H2O) under (1) pressure support ventilation (0, 10, 15 cm H2O), (2) volume and pressure-regulated volume ventilation, (3) flow and pressure-triggering, and (4) varying levels of PEEP and pressure-rise time. Individual and grouped measurements were made by 4 - 7 clinicians on 3 different ventilators. The concordance between occlusion Δ Paw and Δ Pmus was arbitrarily set at ≤ 2 cm H2O. Data were evaluated by using analysis of variance and the Tukey-Kramer posttest. Correlation was assessed by using the Pearson R test; bias and precision were assessed by using the Bland-Altman method. Alpha was set at 0.05. RESULTS Grouped expiratory pause maneuver measurements of occlusion Δ Paw across simulated Δ Pmus, mode and level of ventilatory support showed reasonable concordance, regardless of the ventilator used. Occlusion Δ Paw accuracy frequently decreased by ∼3 cm H2O when both pressure support ventilation and Δ Pmus reached 15 cm H2O. Expiratory pause maneuver accuracy was not affected by trigger mechanism and/or sensitivity, PEEP, or the post-trigger pressurization rate. In general, only small differences in Δ Paw occurred among the individual operators. CONCLUSIONS The expiratory pause maneuver generally provided reproducible, stable approximations of Δ Pmus across ventilators and ventilator settings, and a range of simulated effort. Technique standardization produced relatively consistent results across multiple operators. The expiratory pause maneuver seemed feasible for general use in monitoring inspiratory effort during assisted mechanical ventilation.","Kallet, Richard H; Phillips, Justin S; Summers, Travis J; Burns, Gregory; Pangilinan, Lance; Carothers, Logan; Mangalindan, Earl R; Lipnick, Michael S",Respiratory care,https://doi.org/10.4187/respcare.09047; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34493608/,192

However, few studies have followed-up participants as the pandemic evolved and examined both between and within person predictors of symptom trajectories. In the current study, adolescents and young adults (N=532) in New York were surveyed monthly between March 27th and July 14th, 2020, a period spanning the first peak and subsequent decline in COVID-19 infection rates in the region. Surveys assessed symptoms of depression and anxiety using the Child Depression Inventory and the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Disorders, as well as experiences related to the pandemic. Multilevel growth modeling indicated that symptoms of depression and anxiety peaked around late April/early May and then decreased through May-July. Some pandemic experiences followed a similar quadratic trajectory, while others decreased linearly across the study. Specific relationships emerged between some types of pandemic experiences and depression and anxiety symptoms. While symptoms of depression and anxiety in youth may have been elevated early in the pandemic, these findings suggest they subsided across Spring-Summer of 2020, with higher levels of both corresponding to a period of peak infection rates and decreases paralleling the decline in pandemic experiences and COVID-19 infection rates.","Hawes, Mariah T; Szenczy, Aline K; Olino, Thomas M; Nelson, Brady D; Klein, Daniel N",Psychiatry research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2021.113778; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33550176/,192

153826,Can we beat influenza?,2017,"Long-lived bone marrow plasma cells (BMPCs) are a persistent and essential source of protective antibodies1-7. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) convalescent individuals have a significantly lower risk of reinfection8-10. Nonetheless, it has been reported that anti-SARS-CoV-2 serum antibodies experience rapid decay in the first few months after infection, raising concerns that long-lived BMPCs may not be generated and humoral immunity against this virus may be short-lived11-13. Here we demonstrate that in patients who experienced mild infections (n=77), serum anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) antibodies decline rapidly in the first 4 months after infection and then more gradually over the following 7 months, remaining detectable at least 11 months after infection. Anti-S antibody titers correlated with the frequency of S-specific BMPCs obtained from bone marrow aspirates of 18 SARS-CoV-2 convalescent patients 7 to 8 months after infection. S-specific BMPCs were not detected in aspirates from 11 healthy subjects with no history of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We demonstrate that S-binding BMPCs are quiescent, indicating that they are part of a long-lived compartment. Consistently, circulating resting memory B cells directed against the S protein were detected in the convalescent individuals. Overall, we show that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces a robust antigen-specific, long-lived humoral immune response in humans.","Turner, Jackson S; Kim, Wooseob; Kalaidina, Elizaveta; Goss, Charles W; Rauseo, Adriana M; Schmitz, Aaron J; Hansen, Lena; Haile, Alem; Klebert, Michael K; Pusic, Iskra; O'Halloran, Jane A; Presti, Rachel M; Ellebedy, Ali H",Nature,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03647-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34030176/,192

The PTC has been recognized as the earliest ribosomal part and its origins embodied the First Universal Common Ancestor (FUCA). The PTC is frequently assumed to be highly conserved along all living beings. In this work, we posed the following questions: (i) How many 100% conserved bases can be found in the PTC? (ii) Is it possible to identify clusters of informationally linked nucleotides along its sequence? (iii) Can we propose how the PTC was formed? (iv) How does sequence conservation reflect on the secondary and tertiary structures of the PTC? Aiming to answer these questions, all available complete sequences of 23S ribosomal RNA from Bacteria and Archaea deposited on GenBank database were downloaded. Using a sequence bait of 179 bp from the PTC of Thermus termophilus, we performed an optimum pairwise alignment to retrieve the PTC region from 1424 filtered 23S rRNA sequences. These PTC sequences were multiply aligned, and the conserved regions were assigned and observed along the primary, secondary, and tertiary structures. The PTC structure was observed to be more highly conserved close to the adenine located at the catalytical site. Clusters of interrelated, co-evolving nucleotides reinforce previous assumptions that the PTC was formed by the concatenation of proto-tRNAs and important residues responsible for its assembly were identified.

155522,Model-based process development and evaluation of twin-column continuous capture processes with Protein A affinity resin.,2020-08-16,"OBJECTIVES Growing clinical demands for stronger and faster bone bonding to the implant have motivated the development of methods enhancing osseointegration. Lately, the application of bisphosphonates (bis) in order to optimize bone healing has become a topic of great interest. N-containing bis, such as alendronate (ALN), are the more potent drugs of this class. It was the aim of this study to determine the effect of ALN on the osseointegration of a well-documented nanotreated implant system in a rabbit femoral condyle model. MATERIAL AND METHODS Thirty-two adult female New Zealand White rabbits received one implant (3.25 mm in diameter and 10 mm in length) in their left femoral condyle, a week after they were ovariectomized. Half of them were saline treated (control, group A) and the other half were ALN treated (group B). Rabbits from both groups were euthanized after 6 and 12 weeks, respectively. RESULTS The specimens were evaluated histologically and histomorphometrically. Upon histological evaluation, no obvious differences were found between the control and the treatment group. Implants showed good integration into the bone tissue surrounding them. There were also no statistically significant differences in bone-to-implant contact and the amount of bone tissue in the immediate neighborhood of the implant at both healing periods. CONCLUSIONS The systemic administration of ALN was not found to affect histological osseointegration of implants in animals with a hormonal status resembling that of postmenopausal healthy women. Further research will be needed to investigate this approach.","Tsetsenekou, Efstathia; Papadopoulos, Triantafillos; Kalyvas, Demos; Papaioannou, Nikos; Tangl, Stefan; Watzek, Georg",Clinical oral implants research,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0501.2011.02189.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21488972/,192

DESIGN A systematic review and meta-analysis. PARTICIPANTS DED patients were individuals with dry eye symptoms or primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS). Controls were healthy, non-pSS, or non-DED patients. METHODS A systematic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and grey literature was conducted. Studies were screened using Covidence software. Outcomes included sleep quality, duration, daytime sleepiness, prevalence/incidence/severity of sleep disorders, and sleep disturbances. Meta-analysis was conducted using STATA 13.0. The weighted mean difference (WMD) was calculated as the effect size for continuous scale outcomes. Random-effects models were developed based on the presence of heterogeneity. RESULTS Seventeen full-text articles (16 370 subjects) and 2 conference abstracts (571 763 subjects) were included. Compared to controls, DED patients score higher on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (WMD = 1.69, 95% CI: 0.82, 2.56; I2 = 88.8%, p < 0.001) and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (WMD = 2.26, 95% CI: 0.96, 3.56; I2 = 82.4%, p < 0.001). Additionally, DED patients spend less time asleep (WMD = -0.59 hours, 95% CI: -0.94, -0.24; I2 = 85.1%, p < 0.001), experience more sleep disturbances, and may have increased prevalence, incidence, severity of sleep disorders. CONCLUSION DED patients may have poorer sleep quality, greater daytime sleepiness, less sleep, more sleep disturbances, increased prevalence, incidence, and severity of sleep disorders compared to non-DED patients. Further research is needed to identify potential causes of these outcomes given the paucity and heterogeneity of included studies.

However, radiation dose estimations for nonhuman primates from molecular imaging probes are lacking and are difficult to perform experimentally. The aim of this work is to construct age-dependent NHP computational model series to estimate the absorbed dose to NHP specimens in common molecular imaging procedures. MATERIALS AND METHODS A series of NHP models from baby to adult were constructed based on non-uniform rational B-spline surface (NURBS) representations. Particle transport was simulated using Monte Carlo calculations to estimate S-values from nine positron-emitting radionuclides and absorbed doses from PET radiotracers. RESULTS Realistic age-dependent NHP computational model series were developed. For most source-target pairs in computational NHP models, differences between C-11 S-values were between -13.4% and -8.8%/Kg difference in body weight while differences between F-18 S-values were between -12.9% and -8.0%/Kg difference in body weight. The absorbed doses of 11 C-labelled brain receptor substances, 18 F-labelled brain receptor substances and 18 F-FDG in the brain ranged within 0.047 - 0.32 mGy/MBq, 0.25 - 1.63 mGy/MBq and 0.32 - 2.12 mGy/MBq, respectively. CONCLUSION The absorbed doses to organs are significantly higher in the baby NHP model than in the adult model. These results can be used in translational longitudinal studies to estimate the cumulated absorbed organ doses in NHPs at various ages.","Xie, Tianwu; Chen, Xin; Zaidi, Habib",Medical physics,https://doi.org/10.1002/mp.14333; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32542710/,192
156849,Synthesis of Indolizines from Pyridinium Salts and Ethyl Bromodifluoroacetate.,2020-11-16,"UNLABELLED Work-related musculoskeletal disorders are increasing due to industrialisation of work processes. Task variation has been suggested as potential intervention. The objectives of this study were to investigate, first, the influence of task variation on electromyographic (EMG) manifestations of shoulder muscle fatigue and discomfort; second, noticeable postural shoulder changes over time; third, if the association between task variation and EMG might be biased by postural changes. Outcome parameters were recorded using multichannel EMG, Optotrak and the Borg scale. Fourteen participants performed a one-hour repetitive Pegboard task in one continuous and two interrupted conditions with rest and a pick-and-place task, respectively. Manifestations of shoulder muscle fatigue and discomfort feelings were observed throughout the conditions but these were not significantly influenced by task variation. After correction for joint angles, the relation between task variation and EMG was significantly biased but significant effects of task variation remained absent. PRACTITIONER SUMMARY Comparing a one-hour continuous, repetitive Pegboard task with two interrupted conditions revealed no significant influences of task variation. We did observe that the relation between task variation and EMG was biased by posture and therefore advise taking account for posture when investigating manifestations of muscle fatigue in assembly tasks.","Luger, Tessy; Bosch, Tim; Hoozemans, Marco; de Looze, Michiel; Veeger, Dirkjan",Ergonomics,https://doi.org/10.1080/00140139.2015.1043356; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26046391/,192
156936,Advancements in the Development of Non-Nitrogen-Based Amphiphilic Antiseptics to Overcome Pathogenic Bacterial Resistance.,2020-09-04,"BACKGROUND Health assessments are a vital competency required of nurses. The more traditional ways of teaching and learning this skill require practice and are often limited by time constraints. With the rise of technology-based platforms, students can supplement their learning health assessment skills through other means, such as videos, that not only teach the steps but also allow them to learn in context. OBJECTIVES This study describes how a symptom-focused health assessment and empathy (SHAE) program, which primarily involves the use of a case-based health assessment video, was implemented and evaluated. DESIGN The study involved a single-centre, single-blind, parallel randomized controlled trial. SETTINGS The study was conducted at a university in Singapore. PARTICIPANTS Year one undergraduate nursing students enrolled in the Comprehensive Health Assessment (CHA) module during semester two of the academic year 2018/2019 participated in the study. METHODS Participants were randomized into one of the two parallel groups: the experimental group or the waitlisted control (WL) group. The experimental group received the SHAE program in addition to conventional learning methods (e-lectures, lab demonstration, and pair practice). The WL group received only the conventional learning methods. Pre- and post-test measures of the study variables such as knowledge, health assessment skills, confidence, empathy, and intention to learn were conducted. The WL group was given access to the SHAE program after the post-test. Analyses of covariance (ANCOVA) were used to compare the means of the study variables between the intervention and WL groups. RESULTS Participants in the intervention group had significantly higher scores on knowledge (p = 0.016), confidence (p = 0.03), and health assessment skills (p = 0.004). No significant differences in intention to learn and empathy between the two groups were found. CONCLUSION The use of a case-based video has the potential to be a valuable method of teaching health assessments in context to nursing students. The SHAE program has shown beneficial effects on students' knowledge, health assessment skills, and confidence. However, there was no effect on students' intentions to learn and their empathy. Further refinements of the program will need to focus on improving these domains.","Chen, Hui-Chen; Ignacio, Jeanette; Yobas, Piyanee",Nurse education today,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nedt.2020.104566; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32942245/,192

This review examines the strategies used to confer abuse-deterrent properties on opioid abuse-deterrent formulations (ADFs), the characteristics and supporting data for each of the available ADFs, and the role of opioid ADFs as part of a comprehensive opioid risk management plan. METHODS A PubMed search was performed for articles published within the last 10 years using the search terms ""abuse deterrent opioids"". Articles were limited to clinical studies and reviews focusing on United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved opioid ADFs in the US. RESULTS There are currently nine extended-release and one immediate-release opioid pain medications with US FDA-approved ADF labelling. All use either physical and chemical barriers or agonist/antagonist combinations to deter manipulation and abuse. Evidence is mounting that introduction of opioid ADFs has been associated with decreased rates of abuse and diversion of opioids in the US. CONCLUSIONS Although not sufficient by themselves to prevent prescription opioid abuse and misuse, opioid ADFs are an important component of a healthcare provider's comprehensive opioid risk management plan (along with utilization of prescription drug monitoring programs, clinical assessment tools, urine tests, co-prescribing of naloxone to patients at risk of an overdose, access to non-pharmacological treatments and addiction/mental health resources, among others). Adoption of opioid ADFs should be considered as part of an overall public health opioid risk management plan involving all stakeholders to balance legitimate safe and effective use of opioids against misuse and abuse.","Pergolizzi, Joseph V; Raffa, Robert B; Taylor, Robert; Vacalis, Steven",Current medical research and opinion,https://doi.org/10.1080/03007995.2017.1419171; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29262730/,192

We call attention to the current COVID-19 pandemic, that is leading to an increase in the prevalence of sleep disturbances, and as a consequence, higher states of stress and anxiety, which are possible triggers for TE. In parallel, trichodynia is a sensorial symptom that is commonly related with hair diseases, including TE. We argue that substance P, a neuropeptide that has participation in the neuroinflammation and also in the sleep regulation, may play a possible role in this scalp paresthesia. We suggest that there may be an association between this substrate and sleep, which can aggravate trichodynia and TE.

157895,Assessment of saliva interference with UV-based disinfection technologies.,2021-03-04,"PURPOSE The aim of this study is to assess the incidence of incisional ventral hernia and small bowel obstruction following laparoscopic and open colorectal resection. METHODS A retrospective review was performed of a large database comprising 13 hospitals, serving 3.6 million patients in Southern California. Patients 18 years and older undergoing elective colorectal resection over a 3-year period were included. The crude incidence rates were calculated, and relative risks of ventral hernia and small bowel obstruction were determined using multivariable proportional hazard modeling. RESULTS Four thousand six hundred and thirteen patients underwent 4765 colorectal resections between August 2008 and August 2011. Fifty-nine percent of the cases were performed laparoscopically; the median age was 63 years, and 49% were males. Colorectal carcinoma (45%) and diverticulitis (18%) were the most common indications for surgery. The median follow-up was 2.4 years. Kaplan-Meier estimates of ventral hernia at 1, 2, and 3 years among the open cohort were significantly higher at 10.1, 17.0, and 20.5%, compared to 5.7, 8.7, and 10.8% in the laparoscopic cohort (p < 0.001). Similarly, small bowel obstruction was higher in the open compared to the laparoscopic group (open 10.4, 15.0, and 18.3% vs. laparoscopic 2.7, 4.4, and 5.5%, p < 0.001). Patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal resection were less likely to develop ventral hernia [adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) 0.64 (95% CI 0.52, 0.80); p < 0.0001] and small bowel obstruction [AHR 0.41 (95% CI 0.31, 0.54); p < 0.0001]. CONCLUSIONS The incidence of incisional ventral hernia and small bowel obstruction is significantly reduced in patients who undergo laparoscopic compared to open colorectal resection.","Klaristenfeld, Daniel D; McLemore, Elisabeth C; Li, Bonnie H; Abbass, Mohammad A; Abbas, Maher A",Langenbeck's archives of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00423-015-1301-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25876737/,192

The conventional X-ray TLI approach relies on an absorption grating to create an array of micrometer-sized X-ray sources, posing numerous limitations, including technical challenges associated with grating fabrication for high-energy operations. We overcome these limitations by developing a TLI system with a microarray anode-structured target (MAAST) source. The MAAST features an array of precisely controlled microstructured metal inserts embedded in a diamond substrate. Using this TLI system, tomography of a Drum fish tooth with high resolution and tri-contrast (absorption, phase, and scattering) reveals useful complementary structural information that is inaccessible otherwise. The results highlight the exceptional capability of high-resolution multicontrast X-ray tomography empowered by the MAAST-based TLI method in biomedical applications.","Zan, Guibin; Gul, Sheraz; Zhang, Jin; Zhao, Wei; Lewis, Sylvia; Vine, David J; Liu, Yijin; Pianetta, Piero; Yun, Wenbing",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2103126118; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34140413/,192

We evaluated whether collaterals and thrombus burden influence the associations between revascularization, time-to-treatment, and outcome in endovascular therapy-treated patients with basilar artery occlusion. Methods- We retrospectively analyzed clinical and imaging data of consecutive endovascular therapy-treated patients with basilar artery occlusion included in the multicenter Basilar Artery Treatment and Management Collaboration. The BATMAN (Basilar Artery on Computed Tomography Angiography score, which evaluates thrombus burden and collaterals) and the PC-CS (Posterior Circulation Collateral score, which evaluates collaterals) were assessed on computed tomography angiography, blinded to clinical outcome. Good outcome was defined as modified Rankin Scale score of ≤3 within 3 months; revascularization (successful reperfusion) as modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction 2b-3 (or TIMI [Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction] 2-3 in the BASICS [Basilar Artery International Cooperation Study] registry). Results- We included 172 patients with basilar artery occlusion treated with endovascular therapy (124 with mechanical thrombectomy): mean (SD) age 65 (13) years, median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale 22 (interquartile range 12-30), 64 (37%) treated >6 hours. Revascularization (achieved in 79% of patients) was associated with good outcome ( P=0.003). The use of new generation thrombectomy devices was associated with good outcome ( P=0.03). In patients who achieved revascularization, 29/46 (63%) of patients with a favorable BATMAN score and 26/51 (51%) with favorable PC-CS had good outcomes. In logistic regression analysis (adjusted for age, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, and time-to-treatment ≤6/>6 hours), revascularization was associated with good outcome in patients with favorable BATMAN score (odds ratio, 15.8; 95% CI, 1.4-175; P=0.02) or PC-CS (odds ratio, 9.4; 95% CI, 1.4-64; P=0.02). In patients who achieved revascularization, early (time-to-treatment ≤6 hours) but not late treatment was associated with improved outcome in patients with unfavorable BATMAN score (18/52 [35%]; odds ratio, 15; 95% CI, 1.9-124; P=0.01) or PC-CS (16/44 [36%]; odds ratio, 5.5; 95% CI, 1.4-21; P=0.01).

160117,Towards homogenization of liquid plug distribution in reconstructed 3D upper airways of the preterm infant.,2021-04-22,"BACKGROUND The risk of stroke associated with carotid artery restenosis after stenting or endarterectomy is unclear. We aimed to compare the long-term risk of restenosis after these treatments and to investigate if restenosis causes stroke in a secondary analysis of the International Carotid Stenting Study (ICSS). METHODS ICSS is a parallel-group randomised trial at 50 tertiary care centres in Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada. Patients aged 40 years or older with symptomatic carotid stenosis measuring 50% or more were randomly assigned either stenting or endarterectomy in a 1:1 ratio. Randomisation was computer-generated and done centrally, with allocation by telephone or fax, stratified by centre, and with minimisation for sex, age, side of stenosis, and occlusion of the contralateral carotid artery. Patients were followed up both clinically and with carotid duplex ultrasound at baseline, 30 days after treatment, 6 months after randomisation, then annually for up to 10 years. We included patients whose assigned treatment was completed and who had at least one ultrasound examination after treatment. Restenosis was defined as any narrowing of the treated artery measuring 50% or more (at least moderate) or 70% or more (severe), or occlusion of the artery. The degree of restenosis based on ultrasound velocities and clinical outcome events were adjudicated centrally; assessors were masked to treatment assignment. Restenosis was analysed using interval-censored models and its association with later ipsilateral stroke using Cox regression. This trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN25337470. This report presents a secondary analysis, and follow-up is complete. FINDINGS Between May, 2001, and October, 2008, 1713 patients were enrolled and randomly allocated treatment (855 were assigned stenting and 858 endarterectomy), of whom 1530 individuals were followed up with ultrasound (737 assigned stenting and 793 endarterectomy) for a median of 4·0 years (IQR 2·3-5·0). At least moderate restenosis (≥50%) occurred in 274 patients after stenting (cumulative 5-year risk 40·7%) and in 217 after endarterectomy (29·6%; unadjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1·43, 95% CI 1·21-1·72; p<0·0001). Patients with at least moderate restenosis (≥50%) had a higher risk of ipsilateral stroke than did individuals without restenosis in the overall patient population (HR 3·18, 95% CI 1·52-6·67; p=0·002) and in the endarterectomy group alone (5·75, 1·80-18·33; p=0·003), but no significant increase in stroke risk after restenosis was recorded in the stenting group (2·03, 0·77-5·37; p=0·154; p=0·10 for interaction with treatment). No difference was noted in the risk of severe restenosis (≥70%) or subsequent stroke between the two treatment groups. INTERPRETATION At least moderate (≥50%) restenosis occurred more frequently after stenting than after endarterectomy and increased the risk for ipsilateral stroke in the overall population. Whether the restenosis-mediated risk of stroke differs between stenting and endarterectomy requires further research.

So far, mainly ascorbate oxidases from plants and only a few from fungi have been described. Although ascorbate oxidases belong to the well-studied enzyme family of multi-copper oxidases, their function is still unclear. In this study, Af_AO1, an enzyme from the fungus Aspergillus flavus, was characterized. Sequence analyses and copper content determination demonstrated Af_AO1 to belong to the multi-copper oxidase family. Biochemical characterization and 3D-modeling revealed a similarity to ascorbate oxidases, but also to laccases. Af_AO1 had a 10-fold higher affinity to ascorbic acid (KM = 0.16 ± 0.03 mM) than to ABTS (KM = 1.89 ± 0.12 mM). Furthermore, the best fitting 3D-model was based on the ascorbate oxidase from Cucurbita pepo var. melopepo. The laccase-like activity of Af_AO1 on ABTS (Vmax = 11.56 ± 0.15 µM/min/mg) was, however, not negligible. On the other hand, other typical laccase substrates, such as syringaldezine and guaiacol, were not oxidized by Af_AO1.

160237,Asian Congress on Biotechnology 2019.,2020-06-01,"BACKGROUND Iron and steel industry is an important source of air pollution emissions. Few studies have investigated cardiovascular effects of air pollutants emitted from steel plants. OBJECTIVE We examined the influence of outdoor air pollution in the vicinity of a steel plant on cardiovascular physiology in Sault Ste. Marie, Canada. METHODS Sixty-one healthy, non-smoking subjects (females/males=33/28, median age 22 years) spent 5 consecutive 8-hour days outdoors in a residential area neighbouring a steel plant, or on a college campus approximately 5 kilometres away from the plant, and then crossed over to the other site with a 9-day washout. Mid day, subjects underwent daily 30-minute moderate intensity exercise. Blood pressure (BP) and pulse rate were determined daily and post exercise at both sites. Flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD) was determined at the site near the plant. Air pollution was monitored at both sites. Mixed-effects regressions were run for statistical associations, adjusting for weather variables. RESULTS Concentrations of ultrafine particles, sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and carbon monoxide (CO) were 50-100% higher at the site near the plant than at the college site, with minor differences in temperature, humidity, and concentrations of particulate matter ≤2.5 μm in size (PM2.5) and ozone (O3). Resting pulse rate [mean (95% confidence interval)] was moderately higher near the steel plant [+1.53 bpm (0.31, 2.78)] than at the college site, male subjects having the highest pulse rate elevation [+2.77 bpm (0.78, 4.76)]. Resting systolic and diastolic BP and pulse pressure, and post-exercise BP and pulse rate were not significantly different between two sites. Interquartile range concentrations of SO2 (2.9 ppb), NO2 (5.0 ppb) and CO (0.2 ppm) were associated with increased pulse rate [0.19 bpm (-0.00, 0.38), 0.86 bpm (0.03, 1.68), and 0.11 bpm (0.00, 0.22), respectively], ultrafine particles (10,256 count/cm(3)) associated with increased pulse pressure [0.85 mmHg (0.23, 1.48)], and NO2 and CO inversely associated with FMD [-0.14% (-0.31, 0.02), -0.02% (-0.03, -0.00), respectively]. SO2 during exercise was associated with increased pulse rate [0.26 bpm (0.01, 0.51)]. CONCLUSION Air quality in residential areas near steel plants may influence cardiovascular physiology.","Liu, Ling; Kauri, Lisa Marie; Mahmud, Mamun; Weichenthal, Scott; Cakmak, Sabit; Shutt, Robin; You, Hongyu; Thomson, Errol; Vincent, Renaud; Kumarathasan, Premkumari; Broad, Gayle; Dales, Robert",International journal of hygiene and environmental health,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijheh.2013.06.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23911139/,192

Genital bleeding was more likely to occur in subjects with secondary dysmenorrhea than in those with primary dysmenorrhea, and in subjects with ""uterine myoma or adenomyosis"" than in those with ""endometriosis alone."" In any of the categorizations, there tended to be fewer days with genital bleeding as the treatment period increased in length, and most of the genital bleeding cases were mild. The change from baseline in the dysmenorrhea score (mean ± standard deviation [SD]) was -3.7 ± 1.6 at Week 24 of treatment and -4.0 ± 1.3 at Week 52. CONCLUSION This study showed favorable tolerability of the long-term use of DNG to patients with dysmenorrhea and a sustainable pain relief effect.","Osuga, Yutaka; Hayashi, Koichi; Kanda, Shingo",The journal of obstetrics and gynaecology research,https://doi.org/10.1111/jog.14209; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32050307/,192

The PRediction of Opioid-induced Respiratory Depression In Patients Monitored by capnoGraphY (PRODIGY) trial investigates CEM using pulse oximetry and capnography in 1650 patients at 16 centers in North America, Europe, and Asia (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02811302). The primary goal of the study is to derive a risk prediction score for respiratory depression (RD) on the ward. The validation-derivation cohort design will derive this score from RD detected by continuous, blinded, multiparameter cardiorespiratory (heart rate, respiratory rate, end tidal carbon dioxide, and pulse oximetry) monitoring of patients on the ward receiving parenteral (including epidural) opioids for primary analgesia.

The ways in which affiliation may affect the risk of infectious agent transmission remain unclear. Moreover, studies linking variation in affiliative interactions to infectious agent incidence/diversity have speculated that disease transmission may have occurred, rather than revealing that transmission did occur. We address these gaps using the phylogenetics of commensal gut Escherichia coli to determine whether affiliative grooming and huddling social networks mediated microbial transmission among rhesus macaques. We collected behavioural and microbial data from adult macaques across a 12-week period that was split into two 6-week phases to better detect dyadic transmission. We reconstructed undirected social networks from affiliative interactions and reconstructed microbial transmission networks from the pairwise phylogenetic similarity of E. coli pulsotypes from macaques within and across adjacent sampling events. Macaque E. coli pulsotypes were more phylogenetically similar to each other than to environmental isolates, which established a premise for socially mediated transmission. Dyadic grooming and huddling frequencies strongly influenced the likelihood of E. coli transmission during the second data collection phase, but not the first. Macaques that were more central/well connected in both their grooming and huddling networks were also more central in the E. coli transmission networks. Our results confirmed that affiliative grooming and huddling behaviours mediate the transmission of gut microbes among rhesus macaques, particularly among females and high-ranking individuals. The detectability of socially mediated E. coli transmission maybe partially masked by environmental acquisition in males, or by high frequencies of interactions in captivity. Predicting the potential transmission pathways of gastrointestinal parasites and pathogens, our findings add to current knowledge of the coevolutionary relationships between affiliative behaviour and health and may be used to identify 'superspreader' individuals as potential targets for disease control strategies.","Balasubramaniam, Krishna N; Beisner, Brianne A; Hubbard, Josephine A; Vandeleest, Jessica J; Atwill, Edward R; McCowan, Brenda",Animal behaviour,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2019.03.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32831349/,192

Evidence-based guidelines recommend testosterone treatment only for men with symptoms and signs of testosterone deficiency and consistently low serum testosterone concentrations; luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) measurements and discussion of risks and benefits of testosterone prior to therapy. However, the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Office of the Inspector General (OIG) report found that health care providers were adhering poorly to guideline recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of men with hypogonadism. Methods A prior authorization drug request (PADR) testosterone order template was implemented at VA Puget Sound Health Care System. A retrospective chart review was conducted in veterans who were prescribed testosterone and had no previous prescription in the prior year. Eligible veterans were evaluated 6 months before (pretemplate) and after (posttemplate) implementation of the template, and 3 months after removal of alternative testosterone ordering pathways (posttemplate/no alternative ordering pathways) that were discovered after PADR template implementation. We assessed the proportion of eligible veterans with documented symptoms of testosterone deficiency; appropriate diagnosis and evaluation of hypogonadism with ≥ 2 low serum testosterone and LH and FSH levels; and discussion of risks and benefits of testosterone treatment. Results In the pretemplate period, only 20 of 80 eligible veterans (25%) had a completed PADR for testosterone. In the posttemplate period, 18 of 45 (44%) eligible veterans had a completed PADR but only 7 (17%) had the testosterone order template completed. In the posttemplate/no alternative ordering pathways period, 13 (68%) and 11 (58%) of 19 eligible veterans had a completed PADR and testosterone order template, respectively. In all 3 periods, documentation of clinical symptoms and a discussion of risks and benefits were similar. In contrast, the proportion of veterans who had ≥ 2 low testosterone levels with LH and FSH levels measured in the posttemplate and posttemplate/no alternative ordering pathways periods were higher (41% and 37%, respectively) vs the pretemplate period (23%). Veterans with documented clinical symptoms, discussion of risks and benefits, and ≥ 2 low testosterone with gonadotropin measurements were 100%, 57%, and 71%, respectively, in the posttemplate/no alternative ordering pathways period. Conclusions Implementation of a PADR order template may be a promising approach to improve the diagnosis of hypogonadism and appropriate testosterone therapy in accordance with established evidence-based clinical practice guidelines, particularly in veterans who are receiving new prescriptions.","Narla, Radhika; Mobley, Daniel; Nguyen, Ethan H K; Song, Cassandra; Matsumoto, Alvin M","Federal practitioner : for the health care professionals of the VA, DoD, and PHS",https://doi.org/10.12788/fp.0103; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33859463/,192

We used a 17-point Attitude towards COVID-19 Questionnaire based on the results of the half-structured interview with the students. We subjected the received data to a factor analysis.ResultsWith the principal components method, we obtained a five-factor structure of the questionnaire under study with the total variance of 65.2%. According to the content of the questions, we defined these factors in the following way: factor of COVID-19 danger to the society (with variance – 20.2%);factor of ruined personal life plans (14.0%);factor of COVID-19 threat to personal health and life (13.9%);factor of disbelief in COVID-19 dangers (9.1%) and factor of expecting new pandemics (8.0%).

A specific type of interaction is that of location-based alerts, where mobile users subscribe to a service provider (SP) in order to be notified when a certain event occurs nearby. Consider, for instance, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, where contact tracing has been singled out as an effective means to control the virus spread. Users wish to be notified if they came in proximity to an infected individual. However, serious privacy concerns arise if the users share their location history with the SP in plaintext. To address privacy, recent work proposed several protocols that can securely implement location-based alerts. The users upload their encrypted locations to the SP, and the evaluation of location predicates is done directly on ciphertexts. When a certain individual is reported as infected, all matching ciphertexts are found (e.g., according to a predicate such as “10 feet proximity to any of the locations visited by the infected patient in the last week”), and the corresponding users notified. However, there are significant performance issues associated with existing protocols. The underlying searchable encryption primitives required to perform the matching on ciphertexts are expensive, and without a proper encoding of locations and search predicates, the performance can degrade a lot. In this paper, we propose a novel method for variable-length location encoding based on Huffman codes. By controlling the length required to represent encrypted locations and the corresponding matching predicates, we are able to significantly speed up performance. We provide a theoretical analysis of the gain achieved by using Huffman codes, and we show through extensive experiments that the improvement compared with fixed-length encoding methods is substantial. © 2021 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","Shaham, S.; Ghinita, G.; Shahabi, C.","Advances in Database Technology - 24th International Conference on Extending Database Technology, EDBT 2021",https://doi.org/10.5441/002/edbt.2021.24,192

We aimed to assess the impact of COVID-19 on French undergraduate students and teachers, to identify practice changes, and to evaluate successes and areas for improvement of this remote learning experience. Data from 2 online questionnaires were analyzed with 509 participants among students and 189 among teachers from Sorbonne University. Responses to multiple choice, Likert response scale, and open-ended questions were evaluated. COVID-19 had negative impact on teaching continuity. Sixty-seven percent of students were in a dropout situation, and many suffered from psychological stress, leading to set up of a psychological support unit. Although most teachers (81%) and students (72%) had limited knowledge of digital resources, distance learning was quickly implemented, with a predominant use of Zoom. The analysis of several parameters revealed that students were significantly more satisfied than teachers by remote learning. Nevertheless, both students and teachers agreed to replace classical lectures by digital media and to promote in-person teaching in small interactive groups. This paper shares tips for faculty rapidly establishing remote learning. This comparative study of the students' and teachers' points of view underlines that new medical curricula should include more digital contents.

The data consisted of a collection of audio samples collected from different sources including dry, wet, whooping and COVID-19 coughs. Unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques were used to reveal the underlying structure of the data, described by dissimilarity spaces constructed from pair-wise dynamic time warping measures derived from the original sound measurements. Intrinsic dimensionality, nonlinear mappings to low-dimensional spaces and visual cluster assessment techniques allowed a representation of the cough types distribution. Supervised classification techniques were used to obtain models identifying cough classes and high performance classifiers were obtained for most of them, including COVID-19.

The Israeli government opted for a model using a proof-of-vaccine document (“Green Pass”). However, the “Green Pass” policy raises practical, legal and ethical concerns. While immunisation passports could be utilised to protect one’s health, significant legal difficulties arise from their usage as a vaccination encouragement scheme. Protecting health is a proper purpose, particularly as minimising the pandemic ameliorates the human rights violations that stem from the COVID-19 response, enables individuals to return to their daily lives and enhances economic activity. However, any privileges or restrictions guided by one’s COVID-19 immunisation status must be designed with the utmost attention to prevent a disproportionate violation of the human rights of the non-vaccinated and the public at large. Furthermore, as “Green Pass” policies might entrench existing discriminatory structures, ensuring equality is vital in moving forward. By exploring two case studies – labour rights and the right to privacy – we demonstrate the legal and public implications of the “Green Pass” regime. Despite the removal of the “Green Pass” in Israel, discussions continue regarding its modified reimplementation.

This study evaluated the use of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) coupled with alternative COVID-19 vaccination strategies to determine feasible Delta mitigation strategies for Australia. We aimed to understanding the interplay between high vaccine coverage levels and NPI physical distancing activation, and to establish the benefit of adding children and adolescents to the vaccination program. Border closure has limited SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Australia, however slow vaccination uptake resulted in Delta outbreaks in the two largest cities, and may continue once international travel resumes. Methods: An agent-based model was used to evaluate the potential reduction in the COVID-19 health burden resulting from alternative vaccination strategies. We assumed immunity was derived from vaccination with the BNT162b2 Pfizer BioNTech vaccine. Two age-specific vaccination strategies were evaluated, age 5 and above, and 12 and above, and the health burden determined under alternative coverages, with/without activation of NPIs. Age-specific infections generated by the model, together with recent UK data, permitted reductions in the health burden to be quantified. Results: Cases, hospitalisations and deaths are shown to reduce by: i) increasing coverage to include children aged 5 to 11 years, ii) activating moderate NPI measures, and/or iii) increasing coverage levels above 80%. At 80% coverage, vaccinating ages 12 plus without NPIs is predicted to give 1,162 hospitalisations; adding ages 5 and above gives 1,073 cases per million population. Activating moderate NPIs reduces hospitalisations to 705. Alternatively, increasing coverage to 90% reduces this to 684. Combining all three measures is shown to reduce cases to 398, hospitalisations to 2 and deaths to zero. Conclusions: Delta variant outbreaks may be successfully managed by an achievable 80% vaccine coverage rate and moderate NPI measures, allowing schools and many workplaces to remain open. This prevents use of hard lockdown measures, and consequential economic and societal damage. Activating moderate NPIs is shown to give a similar reduction in health burden as increasing coverage of ages 12 and above to 90%. If 90% coverage cannot be achieved, including children and adolescents in the vaccination program coupled with moderate NPIs appears necessary to contain future COVID-19 Delta transmission.","Milne, G.

The COVID-19 forecast on infections is significant and crucial information that will help in executing policies and effectively reducing the daily cases. Filtering techniques are important ways to model dynamic structures because they provide good valuations over the recursive Bayesian updates. Kalman filters, one of the filtering techniques, are useful in the studying of contagious infections. Kalman filter algorithm performs an important role in the development of actual and comprehensive approaches to inhibit, learn, react, and reduce spreadable disorder outbreaks in people. The purpose of this paper is to forecast COVID-19 infections using the Kalman filter method. The Kalman filter (KF) was applied for the four most affected countries, namely the United States, India, Brazil, and Russia. Based on the results obtained, the KF method is capable of keeping track of the real COVID-19 data in nearly all scenarios. Kalman filters in the archetype background implement and produce decent COVID-19 predictions.

Results A total of 124 symptomatic COVID-19 patients with a mean age of 42 years (±17) were involved in the study. The median duration of symptom resolution of COVID-19 was seven days with a minimum of two and a maximum of sixty-eight days. Sex and body mass index (BMI) were statistically significant predictors of the symptom resolution. The hazard of having delayed sign or symptom resolution in males was 55% higher than in females (P = 0.039;CI: 0.22?0.96) and the hazard of delayed sign or symptom resolution in those with BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2 was 35% higher than in those with BMI < 25 kg/m2 (P = 0.041;CI: 0.44?0.98]).

However, no-shows are frequent in both general medical practices and specialties, and they can be quite costly and disruptive. This problem has become more severe because of COVID-19. The primary purpose of this study is to develop machine learning algorithms to predict if patients will keep their next appointment, which would help with rescheduling appointments. The main objective in addressing the no-show problem is to reduce the false negative rate (i.e., Type II error). That occurs when the model incorrectly predicts that the patients will show up for an appointment, but they do not. Moreover, the dataset encounters an imbalance issue, and this paper addresses that issue with a new and effective hybrid sampling method: ALL K-NN and adaptive synthetic (ADASYN) yield a 0% false negative rate through machine learning models. This paper also investigates the leading factors that affect the no-show rates for different specialties. The SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) method reveals several patterns to identify the target feature (patient no-shows). It determined that a patient’s history of missed appointments was one of the leading indicators. It was also found that greater lead times between booking the appointment and the appointment date were associated with more no-show behavior. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Alaidah, A.; Alamoudi, E.; Shalabi, D.; AlQahtani, M.; Alnamshan, H.; Abubacker, N.

By varying build direction of SLA zirconia specimens, pin-on-disk tests were carried out to evaluate any differences in wear behavior and phase composition with respect to laminar architecture. All combinations of horizontal and vertical pin-disk combinations demonstrated equivalent wear coefficients and phase transformation from monoclinic to tetragonal zirconia but do exhibit a nominal trend in run-in wear. Given that microstructural consolidation of AM ceramics is highly dependent on debind and/or sintering rather than print parameters the absence of anisotropy introduce by print parameters could benefit the application and development around AM ceramics.","Schiltz, Jessica; Render, Todd; Gatrell, Bernice Aboud; Qu, Haibo; Steiner, Colton; McGinn, Paul; Schmid, Steven",Procedia Manufacturing,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2351978920315717; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351978920315717,192

Epidemic outbreaks are a unique case of supply chain (SC) risks which is particularly characterized by using a long-time period interruption lifestyle, and extreme uncertainty. As international transport stands at the front of trade and is mainly dependent on travel and human interaction, the shipping industry has been affected substantially from the epidemic of COVID-19 directly and indirectly. This paper represents a review that aims to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on the sustainability of maritime supply chains in general and also in selected geographical areas in terms of the regulations and restrictions imposed by specific organizations in some countries as well as the effect on the supply chain sustainability. In addition, the paper highlights the recent technologies that are currently applied in maritime supply chains and how they can be employed as proposed solutions to facilitate the supply chain flow, overcome the negative effect caused by the COVID-19, and provide further managerial insights to cope with this situation in the most efficient and effective way. © 2020 Toate drepturile asupra acestei ediţii sunt rezervate editorilor.","Keshta, J.; Elmesmary, H.; Obrecht, M.","8th International Conference on Advanced Materials and Systems, ICAMS 2020",https://doi.org/10.24264/icams-2020.iii.10,192

167758,Appendix 1 Organisms mentioned in the Handbook,2004-12-31,"The role of rotational molecular motors of the ATP synthase class is integral to the metabolism of cells. Yet the function of FliI6-FliJ complex - a homolog of the F1 ATPase motor - within the flagellar export apparatus remains unclear. We use a simple two-state model adapted from studies of linear molecular motors to identify key features of this motor. The two states are the ‘locked’ ground state where the FliJ coiled coil filament experiences fluctuations in an asymmetric torsional potential, and a ‘free’ excited state in which FliJ undergoes rotational diffusion. Michaelis-Menten kinetics was used to treat transitions between these two states, and obtain the average angular velocity of the FliJ filament within the FliI6 stator: ωmax ≈ 9.0 rps. The motor was then studied under external counter torque conditions in order to ascertain its maximal power output: Pmax ≈ 42 kBT/s, and the stall torque: Gstall ≈ 3 kBT/rad. Two modes of action within the flagellar export apparatus are proposed, in which the motor performs useful work either by continuously ‘grinding’ through the resistive environment, or by exerting equal and opposite stall force on it. In both cases, the resistance is provided by flagellin subunits entering the flagellar export channel prior to their unfolding. We therefore propose that the function of the FliI6-FliJ complex is to lower the energy barrier and therefore assist in unfolding of the flagellar proteins before feeding them into the transport channel.","Kucera, Jiri; Terentjev, Eugene M.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.05.978379,192

It is a common procedure for the identification of many respiratory diseases compared to MRI, CT, and PET scans. This paper presents the use of generative adversarial networks (GAN) to perform the task of lung segmentation on a given CXR. GANs are popular to generate realistic data by learning the mapping from one domain to another. In our work, the generator of the GAN is trained to generate a segmented mask of a given input CXR. The discriminator distinguishes between a ground truth and the generated mask, and updates the generator through the adversarial loss measure. The objective is to generate masks for the input CXR, which are as realistic as possible compared to the ground truth masks. The model is trained and evaluated using four different discriminators referred to as D1, D2, D3, and D4, respectively. Experimental results on three different CXR datasets reveal that the proposed model is able to achieve a dice-score of 0.9740, and IOU score of 0.943, which are better than other reported state-of-the art results.","Munawar, Faizan; Azmat, Shoaib; Iqbal, Talha; Gronlund, Christer; Ali, Hazrat",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.05752v1.pdf,192

Using computational modeling, we compare the reopening of schools with mitigation measures with a strategy in which schoolchildren are segregated into small isolated groups or bubbles, where children physically interact without restrictions while receiving remote instruction from their teachers. This strategy is robust to common perturbations and is more flexible and stable than reopening of schools. Our modeling results and a real-world implementation of a bubbles program in an elementary school in Mexico City support that this strategy is an effective transition alternative, especially in communities with low vaccination rates or where operational costs associated to safely reopening schools cannot be afforded.","Munoz-Nava, L.

Extraordinary shortages of medical resources have been observed in many parts of the world. Some attributing factors include the lack of sufficient stockpiles and the lack of coordinated efforts to deploy existing resources to the locations of greatest need. This paper investigates contingency planning and resources allocation from a risk management perspective, as opposed to the prevailing supply chain perspective. The key idea is that the competition for limited critical resources is not only present in different geographical locations but also at different stages of a pandemic. This paper draws on an analogy between risk aggregation and capital allocation in finance and pandemic resources planning and allocation for healthcare systems. The main contribution is to introduce new strategies for optimal stockpiling and allocation balancing spatio-temporal competition for medical supply and demand.","Chen, Xiaowei Chong Wing Fung Feng Runhuan Zhang Linfeng",Insurance: Mathematics and Economics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.insmatheco.2021.08.001,192

In this paper, a face mask detection model that can accurately detect whether a person is wearing a mask or not is proposed and implemented. The model architecture uses MobileNetV2, which is a lightweight convolutional neural network, therefore requires less computational power and can be easily embedded in computer vision systems and mobile. As a result, it can create a low-cost mask detector system that can help to identify whether a person is wearing a mask or not and act as a surveillance system as it works for both real-time images and videos.

While others have drawn comparisons between past pandemics and Covid-19, we argue that such comparisons are skewed due to the unprecedented reach and consequences of the latter. To better model the structural shock caused by Covid-19 in the USA, we look at the 9/11 terrorist attacks and specifically examine how firms based in New York City back then reacted to the associated financial turmoil. While 9/11 and Covid-19 are categorically different events, their short-term impacts on the stock market, and on New York exchanges in particular, are surprisingly similar. We find firms that financially 'survived' 9/11 also managed to do better - or suffer less - by about 7% in terms of stock returns during Covid-19, compared to control firms that were not exposed to 9/11. In a sense, we show that companies' prior exposure to 9/11 partly 'immunized' them against the consequences of a similarly destabilizing event, albeit two decades later. Interestingly, the trading volume of exposed firms increased due to market buying pressures. Our analysis is robust to various financial proxies, alternative definitions of control firms and varying estimation windows.","Tosun, O.

170662,Detection of a possible multiphase ultra-fast outflow in IRAS 13349+2438 with NuSTAR and XMM-Newton,2020-08-13,"Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a chronic relapsing brain disorder characterized by an impaired ability to stop or control alcohol consumption despite adverse social, occupational, or health consequences. AUD affects nearly one-third of adults at some point during their lives, with an associated cost of approximately $249 billion annually in the U.S. alone. The effects of alcohol consumption are expected to increase significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic, with alcohol sales increased by approximately 54%, potentially exacerbating health concerns and risk-taking behaviors. Unfortunately, existing pharmacological and behavioral therapies for AUD have historically been associated with poor success rates, with approximately 40% of individuals relapsing within three years of treatment. Pre-clinical studies have shown that chronic alcohol consumption leads to significant changes in synaptic function within the dorsal medial striatum (DMS), one of the brain regions associated with AUD and responsible for mediating goal-directed behavior. Specifically, chronic alcohol consumption has been associated with hyperactivity of dopamine receptor 1 (D1) medium spiny neurons (MSN) and hypoactivity of dopamine receptor 2 (D1) MSNs within the DMS. Optogenetic, chemogenetic, and transgenic approaches have demonstrated that reducing the D1/D2 MSN signaling imbalance decreases alcohol self-administration in rodent models of AUD. However, these approaches cannot be studied clinically at this time. Here, we present an electrical stimulation alternative that uses ultra-low (<=1Hz) frequency (ULF) spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) to reduce DMS D1/D2 MSN signaling imbalances by stimulating D1-MSN afferents into the GPi and ACC glutamatergic projections to the DMS in a time-locked stimulation sequence. Our data suggest that GPi/ACC ULF-STDP selectively decreases DMS D1-MSN hyperactivity leading to reduced alcohol consumption without evoking undesired affective behaviors in a two-bottle choice mouse model of AUD.","Asp, Anders J.; Boschen, Suelen Lucio; Lujan, J.

The disease caused by this virus is named as Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), reported first time in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. It had spread to almost all countries of the world disrupting the health and economy of many countries. It was the recent zoonotic spillover disease reported in humans from the Coronavirus group, without proper medicine and non-existence of prior immunity, this disease posed a challenge to both the scientific and medical fraternity. The search for safe, effective drugs to treat the disease and vaccines against the causative agent SARS- CoV-2 had begun all over the world with public and private partnerships. Many countries are part of the solidarity trail for identifying the effective drugs, clinical trials and vaccines for this global pandemic. Here in this review, we are focussing on the different vaccine production platforms being used in the preparation of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, their current status and prospects. Vaccine production technology significantly advanced in recent times by imbibing the cutting edge technologies such as nucleic acid based technologies such as DNA/RNA/Codon deoptimization and availability of safe and effective viral vectors produced through rDNA technology. The availability of complete genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2, geared up for the production of vaccine candidates based on these new vaccine production platforms, and in a record time of 4-5 months, these vaccine candidates entered in human clinical trials for the evaluation of safety and efficacy. Prior knowledge on SARS and MERS-CoV's structural and genomic features, vaccine production platforms used in making vaccines against them greatly augmented in the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine efforts. As per World Health Organization (WHO) a total of202 vaccine candidates are under developing for SARS-CoV-2, among them 47 entered in clinical trials and 156 are in the preclinical stage. These vaccines are prepared by an amalgamation of both new and old traditional vaccine production platforms such as nucleic acid base platforms, inactivated, live attenuated, recombinant viral vectors, protein and peptide-based vaccines. The success of these vaccine candidates lies in the generation of effective immune response for SARS-CoV-2 across all age groups and people with co-morbidities. We briefly summarize the different strategies of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine production and their prospects with an emphasis on different routes of administration and added a basic mathematical model depicting the importance of vaccination for any pandemic.","Bharti, Kotarya Abhishek Pandeya Khalko R.

The results show three periods of increased risk in the sample period: the global financial crisis, the European public debt crisis, and the COVID‐19 pandemic. They also allow us to identify three divergent sets of countries with different systemic liquidity risk characteristics. The analysis also illustrates the impact of the introduction of the euro on systemic illiquidity risk.

In this work, we aimed to understand the immunological dynamics of severe COVID-19 patients with different degrees of illness, and upon long-term recovery. We analyzed immune cellular subsets and SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody isotypes of 66 COVID-19 patients admitted to the Hospital Clinico Universidad de Chile, which were categorized according to the WHO ten-point clinical progression score. These included 29 moderate patients (score 4-5) and 37 severe patients under either high flow oxygen nasal cannula (18 patients, score 6), or invasive mechanical ventilation (19 patients, score 7- 9), plus 28 convalescent patients and 28 healthy controls. Furthermore, six severe patients that recovered from the disease were longitudinally followed over 300 days. Our data indicate that severe COVID-19 patients display increased frequencies of plasmablasts, activated T cells and SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies compared to moderate and convalescent patients. Remarkably, within the severe COVID-19 group, patients rapidly progressing into invasive mechanical ventilation show higher frequencies of plasmablasts, monocytes, eosinophils, Th1 cells and SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG than patients under high flow oxygen nasal cannula. These findings demonstrate that severe COVID-19 patients progressing into invasive mechanical ventilation show a distinctive type of immunity. In addition, patients that recover from severe COVID-19 begin to regain normal proportions of immune cells 100 days after hospital discharge and maintain high levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG throughout the study, which is an indicative sign of immunological memory. Thus, this work can provide a useful benchmark for improvement of disease outcomes.","Garcia-Gonzalez, P.; Tempio, F.; Fuentes, C.; Merino, C.; Vargas, L.; Simon, V.; Ramirez, M.; Rojas, V.; Tobar, E.; Landskron, G.; Araya, J.

This study assessed the seroprevalence among first responders in northeastern Ohio during May- September 2020. Methods: A survey and IgG antibody test against SARS-CoV-2 were offered to University Hospitals Health System affiliated first responder departments. Results: A total of 3080 first responders with diverse job assignments from more than 400 fire and police departments participated in the study. Among them, 73 (2.4%) were seropositive while only 0.8% had previously positive RT-PCR results. Asymptomatic infection accounts for 46.6% of seropositivity. By occupation, seropositive rates were highest among administration/support staff (3.8%), followed by paramedics (3.0%), EMTs (2.6%), firefighters (2.2%), and police officers (0.8%). Seroprevalence was not associated with self-reported exposure as work exposure rates were: paramedics 48.2%, firefighters 37.1%, EMTs 32.3%, police officers 7.7%, and administration/support staff 4.4%. Self-reported community exposure was strongly correlated with self-reported work exposure rate rather than seroprevalence suggesting a potential impact of risk awareness. Additionally, no significant difference was found among gender or age groups; however, black Americans have a higher positivity rate than other races although they reported lower exposure. Conclusions: Despite the high work-associated exposure rate to SARS-CoV-2 infection, first responders with different roles demonstrated seroprevalence no higher than their administrative/supportive colleagues, which suggests infection control measures are effective in preventing work-related infection.","zhang, x.; Saade, E.; Noguez, J.

173523,UHT Sterilized Milks,2022,"The deadly Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak has become one of the most challenging pandemics in the last century. Clinical diagnosis reports a high infection rate within a large population and a rapid mutation rate upon every individual infection. The polymerase chain reaction has been a powerful and gold standard molecular diagnostic technique over the past few decades and hence a promising tool to detect the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid sequences. However, it can be costly and involved in complicated processes with a high demand for on-site tests. This pandemic emphasizes the critical need for designing cost-effective and fast diagnosis strategies to prevent a potential viral source by ultrasensitive and selective biosensors. Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) nanocomposites have been developed with unique physical and chemical properties crucial for building up nucleic acid and protein biosensors. In this review, we cover various types of 2D TMD biosensors available for virus detection via the mechanisms of photoluminescence/optical, field-effect transistor, surface plasmon resonance, and electrochemical signals. We summarize the current state-of-the-art applications of 2D TMD nanocomposite systems for sensing proteins/nucleic acid from different types of lethal viruses. Finally, we identify and discuss the advantages and limitations of TMD-based nanocomposites biosensors for viral recognition.","Lam, Ching Ying Katherine Zhang Qin Yin Bohan Huang Yingying Wang Hui Yang Mo Wong Siu Hong Dexter",Journal of Composites Science,https://doi.org/10.3390/jcs5070190,192

We verified and applied a two-tiered testing strategy combining a SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD)-specific lateral flow assay (LFA) with a nucleocapsid protein (NCP) IgG ELISA to assess seroconversion in n=7241 individuals. The majority had experienced symptoms consistent with COVID-19, but had no access to RT-PCR testing. Longitudinal follow-up in n=97 LFA+ individuals was performed up to 20 weeks after initial infection using NCP and spike protein S1 domain (S1) IgG ELISAs and a surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT). Individuals reporting symptoms from January 2020 onwards showed seroconversion, as did a considerable proportion of asymptomatic individuals. Seroconversion for symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals was higher in an area with a known infection cluster compared to a low incidence area. Overall, 94% of individuals with a positive IgG result by LFA were confirmed by NCP ELISA. The proportion of ELISA-confirmed LFA results declined over time, in line with contracting NCP IgG titers during longitudinal follow-up. Neutralizing antibody activity was considerably more stable than S1 and NCP IgG titers, and both reach a plateau after approximately 100 days. The sVNT proved to be not only highly specific, but also more sensitive than the specificity-focussed two-tiered serology approach. Our results demonstrate the high specificity of two-tiered serology testing and highlight the sVNT used as a valuable tool to support modelling of SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics, complement molecular testing and provide relevant information to individuals.","Garritsen, Anja; Scholzen, Anja; Nieuwenhof, Daan WA van den; Smits, Anke PF; Datema, Esther Suzan; Galen, Luc S van; Kouwijzer, Milou LCE",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.07.20187641,192
173735,Master Citation Index,1987-12-31,"Cell-cell interactions are vital for numerous biological processes including development, differentiation, and response to inflammation. Currently most methods for studying interactions on scRNA-seq level are based on curated databases of ligands and receptors. While those methods are useful, they are limited to our current biological knowledge. Recent advances in single cell protocols have allowed for physically interacting cells to be captured and as such we have the potential to study interactions in a complimentary way without relying on prior knowledge. We introduce a new method for detecting genes that change as a result of interaction based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). We apply our method to synthetic datasets to demonstrate its ability to detect genes that change in an interacting population compared to a reference population. Next, we apply our approach to two datasets of physically interacting cells and identify genes that change as a result of interaction, examples include adhesion and co-stimulatory molecules which confirm physical interaction between cells. For each dataset we produce a ranking of genes that are changing in subpopulations of the interacting cells. In addition to genes, discussed in the original publications we highlight further candidates for interaction in the top 100 and 300 ranked genes. Lastly, we apply our method to a dataset generated by a standard droplet based protocol, not designed to capture interacting cells and discuss its suitability for analysing interactions. We present a method that streamlines the detection of interactions and does not require prior clustering and generation of synthetic reference profiles to detect changes in expression. Author summary While scRNA-seq research is a dynamic area, progress is lacking when it comes to developing methods that allow analysis of interaction that is independent of curated resources of known interacting pairs. Recent advances of sequencing protocols have allowed for interacting cells to be captured. We propose a novel method based on LDA that captures changes in gene expression as a result of interaction. Our method does not require prior information in the form of clustering or generation of synthetic reference profiles. We demonstrate the suitability of our approach by applying it to synthetic and real datasets and manage to capture biologically interesting candidates of interaction.","Pancheva, Alexandrina; Wheadon, Helen; Rogers, Simon; Otto, Thomas",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.26.453767,192

Methods: Literature reviews, focusing on research papers about medical educational changes in South Korea during the COVID-19 pandemic were performed. Selective data collected from a nationwide online survey by the Korean Association of Medical Colleges on the status of curricular changes in medical schools during the COVID-19 was presented. Results: All lectures have moved online, but clinical students continued their hospital placements during the pandemic, except for the first 3-5 weeks during the first surge in 2020. Initial technical naivety of the faculty and lack of technical resources were short-lived and the medical students settled well showing a much higher than expected student satisfaction level over online education. Practical skills sessions which benefit most from onsite hands-on experiences such as anatomy dissection, were delivered through a blended approach in some medical school. Student evaluation is the area of least change, mainly due to the students' lack of trust in online assessments. Conclusion: South Korea' underwent major changes in medical education brought upon COVID-19 and the readiness of the technology adoption has been much increased. Student evaluation is the area of least transformation. Adoption of a programmatic assessment system should be considered to enhance not only learning but also improve trust among stakeholders of medical schools.

Existing classification distinguishes between scheduled and probabilistic DTNs, for which specific routing solutions have been developed. In this paper, we uncover a gap in-between where uncertain contact plans can be exploited to enhance data delivery in many practical scenarios described by probabilistic schedules available a priori. Routing under uncertain contact plans (RUCoP) is next formulated as a multiple-copy Markov Decision Process and then exported to local-knowledge (L-RUCoP) and Contact Graph Routing extensions (CGR-UCoP) which can be implemented in the existing DTN protocol stack. RUCoP and its derivations are evaluated in a first extensive simulation benchmark for DTNs under uncertain contact plans comprising both random and realistic scenarios. Results confirm that RUCoP and L-RUCoP closely approach the ideal delivery ratio of an oracle, while CGR-UCoP improves state-of-the-art DTN routing schemes delivery ratio up to 25%.","Raverta, Fernando D.; Fraire, Juan A.; Madoery, Pablo G.; Demasi, Ramiro A.; Finochietto, Jorge M.; D’Argenio, Pedro R.",Ad Hoc Networks,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.adhoc.2021.102663,192

Hematogenic stem cell transplant (HCT) or cellular therapy (CT) recipients have a high risk of mortality with COVID-19 due to profound immune dysregulation. We aimed to assess the outcomes with COVID-19 in HCT/CT recipients. Methods: A single-center prospective study was conducted, including all (n=40) adult HCT/CT patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 at the University of Kansas from Apr 2020 to Jan 2021. Baseline and disease-related characteristics were ascertained from medical records. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 21 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL). Bivariate analyses, using chi-square and t-test, and logistic regression analyses were conducted. Results: The study included 40 COVID-19 patients (72.5% Oct 2020-Jan 2021), including allogeneic HCT (n=25), autologous HCT (n=13) and CAR-T CT (n=2) with median time since HCT/CT of 12.4 (1- 201.9), 37.2 (0.4-118.7), and 3.8 (2.8-4.8) months. Seventy percent were Caucasians and 17.5 were Hispanics. Primary hematologic malignancy was myeloid (37.5%), lymphoid (35%) or plasma cell disorder (27.5%). Myeloablative conditioning was performed in 65% of patients. Donors were autologous (37.5%), matched sibling (17.5%), matched unrelated (22.5%) and haploidentical (22.5%). COVID-19 was mild (42.5%), moderate (42.5%) or severe (15%). Clinical findings included pneumonia (62.5%), hypoxia (25%) and ICU admission (17.5%) while therapies included remdesivir (47.5%), convalescent plasma (40%), dexamethasone (25%) and monoclonal antibodies (17.5%). Concurrent cancer treatment, other infections and active GVHD were reported in 25% (all myeloma), 20% and 32.5% of patients. After a median follow-up of 74 days (7-269), the mortality rate was 12.5% in all patients and 20% in allo-HCT patients. Significant predictors of COVID-19 severity included allogeneic HCT, concurrent immune suppression and elevated inflammatory markers. (Table).

Part of the challenge faced is distilling pertinent, recent academic findings and research into useful guidance. In this article, we aim to tackle this issue by conducting a state-of-the-art study into organisational cyber security culture research. This work investigates four questions, including how cyber security culture is defined, what factors are essential to building and maintaining such a culture, the frameworks proposed to cultivate a security culture and the metrics suggested to assess it. Through the application of the PRISMA systematic literature review technique, we identify and analyse 58 research articles from the last 10 years (2010-2020). Our findings demonstrate that while there have been notable changes in the use of terms (e.g., information security culture and cyber security culture), many of the most influential factors across papers are similar. Top management support, policy and procedures, and awareness for instance, are critical in engendering cyber security culture. Many of the frameworks reviewed revealed common foundations, with organisational culture playing a substantial role in crafting appropriate cyber security culture models. Questionnaires and surveys are the most used tool to measure cyber security culture, but there are also concerns as to whether more dynamic measures are needed. For practitioners, this article highlights factors and models essential to the creation and management of a robust security culture. For research, we produce an up-to-date characterisation of the field and also define open issues deserving of further attention such as the role of change management processes and national culture in an enterprise's cyber security culture.","Uchendu, Betsy; Nurse, Jason R.

Although children are less commonly infected by SARS CoV 2 than their adult counterparts, and their symptoms are generally milder, a severe type of COVID-19 cannot be precluded. Methods At first, demographic, clinical, laboratory measurement data, and outcomes for 26 COVID 19 infected children of less than 12 years of age, admitted to King Abdallah Hospital, Bisha, Saudi Arabia, were retrieved from the electronic medical records for the observational retrospective study. Later, electronic and manual database searches were carried out for pediatric severe COVID 19 related articles. The relevant data from 20 eligible studies and the present retrospective study were analyzed to assess the association of demographic characteristics and comorbidities with COVID-19 severity. Results In the retrospective study, 5 (19%) of the children presented with severe symptoms admitted to PICU, 18 (69%) presented with cough, 5 (19%) with diarrhea, 7 (27%) with underlying comorbidities, 4 (15%) with respiratory illnesses, 3 (12%) with cardiovascular diseases and 2 (8%) were obese. None of the patient characteristics showed any significant association with COVID-19 severity. Of the 21 studies selected for meta-analyses, 14 studies were included in the analysis of the association between any comorbidity and disease severity, resulting in OR: 2.69, 95%CI: 1.38, 5.26, P < 0.05, for analysis of the association between cardiovascular comorbidities and disease severity 14 studies were included giving OR: 4.06, 95%CI: 1.86 , 8.87, P < 0.05, for analysis of the association between respiratory comorbidity and disease severity 15 studies were included giving OR: 2.05, 95%CI: 1.54 , 2.74, P < 0.05, for analysis of the association between obesity and disease severity 10 studies were included, giving OR: 2.48, 95%CI: 1.16 , 5.32, P < 0.05, for analysis of the association between age <10 years old and diseases severity, 16 studies were included, giving OR: 0.80, 95%CI: 0.65, 0.97, P < 0.05, and for analysis of the association between female gender and disease severity, 19 studies were included, giving OR: 0.83, 95%CI: 0.59, 1.18, P > 0.05.

The turnaround time has a significant impact in terms of marketability and value creation potential of an aircraft and, for this reason, it should be considered as an important driver of fuselage and cabin design decisions. Estimating the turnaround time during the early stages of aircraft design is therefore an essential task. This task becomes even more decisive when designers explore unconventional aircraft architectures or, in general, are still evaluating the fuselage design and its internal layout. In particular, it is of paramount importance to properly estimate the boarding and deboarding times, which contribute for up the 40% to the overall turnaround time. For this purpose, a tool, called SimBaD, has been developed and validated with publicly available data for existing aircraft of different classes. In order to demonstrate SimBaD capability of evaluating the influence of fuselage and cabin features on the turnaround time, its application to an unconventional box-wing aircraft architecture, known as PrandtlPlane, is presented as case study. Finally, considering standard scenarios provided by aircraft manufacturers, a comparison between the turnaround time of the PrandtlPlane and the turnaround time of a conventional competitor aircraft is presented.","Scardaoni, Marco Picchi; Magnacca, Fabio; Massai, Andrea; Cipolla, Vittorio",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.01015v1.pdf,192

177052,Highlights from this issue,2021,"The ongoing global climate change and the associated environmental degradation pose a threat to Europe and the rest of the world. Raw materials and energy are required to produce building materials, which are used for construction purposes. Resulting buildings and structures generate waste during construction, operation, and demolition, and they emit potentially harmful substances. Thus, the key to achieving climate goals is to support low-emission materials and technologies in the construction sector, significantly impacting the environment. In the European Union, building materials are not yet subject to mandatory sustainability assessment during the assessment and verification of constancy of performance (AVCP). Objective evaluation of construction materials’ environmental impact requires it to be carried out based on production data on an industrial scale. This article presents the environmental impact of premixed gypsum-based plasters, commonly used in modern construction. Nine environmental indicators (global warming potential (GWP), depletion potential of the stratospheric ozone layer (ODP), acidification potential (AP), eutrophication potential (EP), formation potential of tropospheric ozone (POCP), abiotic depletion potential (ADP)-elements, ADP-fossil fuels, renewable primary energy resources (PERT), and nonrenewable primary energy resources (PERNT)) of premixed gypsum plasters based on natural and flue gas desulfurization (FGD) gypsum were estimated and discussed. Knowledge of the construction products’ environmental impact is fundamental for creating reliable databases. AVCP of construction materials in the future will use the data collected during the voluntary environmental impact evaluation.","Baran, Edyta Czernik Sebastian Hynowski Mariusz Michałowski Bartosz Piasecki Michał Tomaszewska Justyna Michalak Jacek",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su13084298,192

It was clear that the influence COVID-19 epidemic on the global market economy has increased operational risks for businesses. The semiconductor industry has high operating risks and financial risks. Moderate financial flexibility (FF) can improve the ability of semiconductor enterprises to acquire financial resources in real time, calmly cope with the impact of uncertainties in operation, improve investment opportunities, and enhance sustainable operation. It is therefore interesting to study the influence of FF on enterprise risk-taking (ERT). Purpose of the article: The aim of the contribution is to explore the effect of FF on ERT within Taiwan’s semiconductor industry amid the COVID-19 pandemic period, and investigate whether ERT varies with semiconductor industry characteristic. Methods: Data from first three quarters of 2020, from multinational semiconductor firms listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange (TSE), were collected and analyzed. Fixed effects regression with heteroscedasticity adjustment used to evaluate the influence of FF on the ERT of Taiwan’s semiconductor industry. Furthermore, in order to corroborate and support the reliability of the results, this research also used the different measures of ERT and Quantile regression (median regression) in the research model to check the robustness. Findings & value added: Empirical results indicate that FF has a U-shaped effect on ERT for multinational semiconductor firms listed on the TSE, particularly within the integrated circuits (IC) manufacturing industry. Additionally, FF also has a U-shaped effect on ERT for the asset-light semiconductor and IC manufacturing industries. This article also suggests that for the asset-light semiconductor and IC manufacturing industries, the optimal inflection points are 1.1397 and 0.9729, respectively. Based on the consequences of this study, it is suggested that Taiwan’s semiconductor industry should reasonably maintain FF and focus on the liquidity risk management for the long term value added, even after the COVID-19 pandemic period. © 2021 Nicolaus Copernicus University.

We used open-ended questions to gather data from 19 pre-service Social Sciences teachers to explore their preparedness and readiness to teach in future. The research process constituted two phases. Phase one was implemented from 10 February 2020 to 9 March 2020 and phase two occurred in July 2020. Phase two was necessitated by the negative educational implications of COVID-19. Findings indicated that the participants faced challenges pertaining to content knowledge, which was aggravated by the introduction of online learning due to COVID-19. Despite these challenges, participants remained resilient and optimistic toward the teaching profession. Deducing from their voices, we recommend clarification of content in Social Sciences core subjects of History and Geography. Balanced tuition for content knowledge and pedagogy is recommended. Ongoing professional development is needed for academic advisors concerning subject specifications and for lecturers to empower them about remote teaching, communication, and technological skills to improve teaching and learning.

The impact of major depressive disorder (MDD) on social cognitive functioning is far from understood, but essential for prevention and treatment of this neuropsychiatric condition.ObjectivesOur aim was to examine (i) whether face tuning is lower in depression;and (ii) how it is related to other cognitive abilities (such as perceptional organization). Furthermore, we intended to clarify gender impact on face tuning in MDD, as twice more females are affected.MethodsUsing a recently developed paradigm, the Face-n-Food task, we examined face tuning in 26 patients with MDD and 26 person-by-person matched controls. The advantage of non-face images is that its single elements do not promote face processing.ResultsStrikingly, MDD individuals showed intact face tuning. As sex ratio in our patient sample was about 2:1 (as in MDD population in general), we recruited additional male patients and found that MDD male patients were as good as female patients. Yet, while face tuning in MDD patients showed a significant correlation with perceptual organization abilities, in controls, it was linked with social cognition.ConclusionsThe outcome suggests that the origins of aberrant social functioning in MDD lie in maladaptive cognitive schemas rather than in a lack of sensitivity towards social signals per se. To elucidate neural circuits involved in face tuning in MDD, a magnetoencephalography (MEG) study with the Face-n-Food images is currently under progress.DisclosureNo significant relationships.","Kubon, J.; Sokolov, A.; Popp, R.; Fallgatter, A.; Pavlova, M.",European Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2021.1830,192

178516,Characterization of SETD1A haploinsufficiency in humans and Drosophila defines a novel neurodevelopmental syndrome,2019-12-18,"Recent efforts in understanding the course and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infections have highlighted both potential beneficial as well as detrimental effects of cross-reactive antibodies derived from memory immunity. Specifically, due to a significant degree of sequence similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and other members of the coronavirus family, memory B-cells that emerged from previous infections with endemic human coronaviruses (HCoVs) could be re-activated upon encountering the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2, thus prompting the production of cross-reactive antibodies. Understanding the affinity and concentration of these potentially cross-reactive antibodies to the new SARS-CoV-2 antigens is therefore particularly important when assessing both existing immunity against common HCoVs and adverse effects like antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) in COVID-19. However, these two fundamental parameters cannot easily be deconvoluted by surface-based assays like enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) which are routinely used to assess cross-reactivity. Here, we have used microfluidic antibody-affinity profiling (MAAP) to quantitatively evaluate the humoral immune response in COVID-19 convalescent patients by determining both antibody affinity and concentration against spike antigens of SARS-CoV-2 directly in nine convalescent COVID-19 patient and three pre-pandemic sera that were seropositive for common HCoVs. All 12 sera contained low concentrations of high affinity antibodies against spike antigens of HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1, indicative of past exposure to these pathogens, while the affinity against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was lower. These results suggest that cross-reactivity as a consequence of memory re-activation upon an acute SARS-CoV-2 infection may not be a significant factor in generating immunity against SARS-CoV-2.","Denninger, Viola; Xu, Catherine K.; Meisl, Georg; Morgunov, Alexey S.; Fiedler, Sebastian; Ilsley, Alison; Emmenegger, Marc; Malik, Anisa Y.; Piziorska, Monika A.; Schneider, Matthias M.; Devenish, Sean R.

Methods This study was conducted within a cohort of prospectively included patients admitted for COVID-19 in our tertiary medical centres between 1-3-2020 and 1-6-2020. A multidisciplinary study team developed a diagnostic protocol to retrospectively categorize patients as unlikely, possible or probable bacterial co-infection based on clinical, radiological and microbiological parameters in the first 72 hours of admission. Within the three categories, we summarized patient characteristics and antibiotic consumption. Results Among 281 included COVID-19 patients, bacterial co-infection was classified as unlikely in 233 patients (82.9%), possible in 35 patients (12.4%) and probable in 3 patients (1.1%). Ten patients (3.6%) could not be classified due to inconclusive data. Within 72 hours of hospital admission, 81% of the total study population and 78% of patients classified as unlikely bacterial co-infection received antibiotics. Conclusions COVID-19 patients are unlikely to have a respiratory community-acquired bacterial co-infection. Prospective studies should define the safety of restrictive antibiotic use in COVID-19 patients.","de la Court, J. R.; Coenen, S.; Buis, D. T. P.; Meijboom, L. J.; Schade, R. P.; Visser, C.

178858,A Sticky Bacterium Versus Antiadhesive Surfaces,2020,"In the presence of a global pandemic (COVID-19), the relentless pressure on global decision-makers is to ensure a balancing of health (reduce mortality impacts), economic goals (income for livelihood sustenance), and environmental sustainability (stabilize GHG emissions long term). The global energy supply system is a dominant contributor to the GHG burden and deeply embedded in the economy with its current share of 85%, use of fossil fuels has remained unchanged over 3 decades. A unique approach is presented to harmonizing the goals of human safety, economic development, and climate risk, respectively, through an operational tool that provides clear guidance to decision-makers in support of policy interventions for decarbonization. Improving climate change performance as an integral part of meeting human development goals allows the achievement of a country’s environmental, social, and economic well-being to be tracked and monitored. A primary contribution of this paper is to allow a transparent accounting of national performance highlighting the goals of enhancing human safety in concert with mitigation of climate risks. A measure of a country’s overall performance, combined as the Development and Climate Change Performance Index (DCI), is derived from two standardized indexes, the development index H and the Climate Change Performance Index CCPI. Data are analyzed for 55 countries comprising 65 percent of the world’s population. Through active management and monitoring, the proposed DCI can illustrate national performance to highlight a country’s current standing, rates of improvement over time, and a historical profile of progress of nations by bringing climate risk mitigation and economic well-being into better alignment.","Nathwani, Jatin Lind Niels Renn Ortwin Schellnhuber Hans Joachim",Energies,https://doi.org/10.3390/en14144067,192

As a novelty parameters or boundary conditions, namely the non-stationarity of aerosol and the half life of aerosolized virus, were included and a new method for determining the quanta emission rate based on measurements of the particle emission rate and respiratory rate at different types of activities was implemented. As a second step, the model was applied to twelve outbreaks to compare the predicted infection risk with the observed attack rate. To estimate a 'credible interval' of the predicted infection risk the quanta emission rate, the respiratory rate as well as the air volume flow were varied. In nine out of twelve outbreaks, the calculated predicted infection risk via aerosols was found to be in the range the attack rate (with the variation of the boundary conditions) and reasons for the observed larger divergence were discussed. The validation was considered successful and therefore, the use of the model could be recommended to predict the risk of an infection via aerosols in given situations.

This analysis examines the deployment of such resources in advertising during the global Covid-19 pandemic, focusing on the Southeast Asian nation of Singapore. We identify five discourses that offer distinct framings of Covid-19 as a challenge for workers, a wellness issue, a threat to home and family, a challenge for women, and a threat to the Singapore lifestyle. Undergirded by neoliberal notions such as the productivity imperative, these discourses rationalize a range of consumer behaviors as necessary and justified in the struggle to defeat the virus. Advertisements are argued to place the burden of navigating the pandemic primarily on women via the evocation of power femininity.

The method used was conducting a direct survey in Malioboro and giving a closed questionnaire online to the public. The discussion was performed by examining the results of a closed questionnaire with the current situation in Malioboro. The conclusions obtained that the community has received information to maintain social distancing. However, many people ignore the health protocols so that no difference with the situation before the pandemic. This condition does not change the spatial patterns and layouts related to space at the public scale and the distance of social interactions.

181722,Biogenic silver nanoparticles of antibacterial activities for poly-herbal extracts in novel medicine,2021,"In response to physiological demand, the pituitary gland generates new hormone-secreting cells from committed progenitor cells throughout life. It remains unclear to what extent pituitary stem cells (PSCs), which uniquely express SOX2, contribute to pituitary growth and renewal. Moreover, neither the signals that drive proliferation nor their sources have been elucidated. We have used genetic approaches in the mouse, showing that the WNT pathway is essential for proliferation of all lineages in the gland. We reveal that SOX2+ stem cells are a key source of WNT ligands. By blocking secretion of WNTs from SOX2+ PSCs in vivo, we demonstrate that proliferation of neighbouring committed progenitor cells declines, demonstrating that progenitor multiplication depends on the paracrine WNT secretion from SOX2+ PSCs. Our results indicate that stem cells can hold additional roles in tissue expansion and homeostasis, acting as paracrine signalling centres to coordinate the proliferation of neighbouring cells.","Russell, John Parkin; Lim, Xinhong; Santambrogio, Alice; Yianni, Val; Kemkem, Yasmine; Wang, Bruce; Fish, Matthew; Haston, Scott; Grabek, Anaëlle; Hallang, Shirleen; Lodge, Emily Jane; Patist, Amanda Louise; Schedl, Andreas; Mollard, Patrice; Nusse, Roeland; Andoniadou, Cynthia Lilian",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.22.107045,192

Project analysis was disseminated to relevant stakeholders via departmental clinical leaders, facilitated by a Directorate Operations Centre (DOC) established at onset. This ensured integration of training within clinical care delivery. The target audience comprised multidisciplinary critical care and anaesthetic staff, and was then expanded to include the wider workforce.Phase one involved drafting a statement of requirement and needs analysis, determined by relevant clinical and educational stakeholders as informed by recommendations from Public Health England, the Royal Colleges and Health Education England. This informed a framework of dynamic role and domain specific training. Leadership was delegated to multidisciplinary educational leads, ensuring academic rigour and credibility. Reciprocal escalation ensured consideration of workforce planning, future-proofing and sensitivity to individual concerns.Subsequent training incorporated a multimodal educational approach. Participant feedback and formal peer review enabled reflection on earlier training delivery, enabling dynamic adaptation of training objectives to ensure relevance and consistency. Almost all 271 nurse upskilling candidates reported a significantly increased knowledge base post session. For Covid 19 teaching days, 90% of 191 candidates reported sessions were at an appropriate level of teaching. All 55 multidisciplinary simulation candidates reported 100% satisfaction.This project dynamically considered all facets of workforce planning and care delivery.

Obtaining the most complete data on COVID-19 in the rheumatic diseases (RD) is an urgent task, and the data received directly from patients seems to be is extremely important. Objectives: To study the factors, associated with the possibility of COVID-19 in patients with RDs. Methods: We conduct COVID-19 Russian rheumatology patient experience survey to create a registry of “Patient's Opinion on COVID-19 in Rheumatic Diseases (POPCORD)”. This ongoing project is based on the data collected directly from Russian-speaking patients with different RDs who fill out a special questionnaire via the https://revmo-covid.ru/. The questionnaire was developed by the national patient organization -Russian Rheumatology Association “Nadezhda” in collaboration with Moscow regional rheumatology center and department of rheumatology of Moscow Regional Research and clinical institute n.a. M.F. Vladimirsky (MONIKI). The anonymous questionnaire includes information on whether the patient had COVID-19, as well as information on rheumatic disease, its treatment, and information on social distancing and compliance with other anti-epidemic measures. Results: At the moment, 1050 patients (92% from Russia, 8% from other countries) completed the survey, including residents of 74 regions of Russia, most of them from Moscow (20%), Moscow region (8%) and St. Petersburg (8%). In total, there were 93% females, with mean age 40,28±11,26 (M±SD, median 38 [32;48]), BMI 24,52±5,38 (median 23,42 [21;27]), disease duration 7,91±8,46 (median 5,00 [2;11]).

This novel virus has now infected more than two hundred countries across the world as it propagates through human activity. In comparison, novel coronavirus signs are very close to general seasonal influenza such as common cold, fever, cough and shortness in breathing. Infected patient monitoring is viewed as a crucial phase in the battle against COVID-19. Detection tools for Positive cases of COVID-19 do not offers distinctive results, so that it has increased the need to support diagnostic tools. Therefore, to prevent further dissemination of this disease, it is extremely important as early as possible to identify positive cases. However, there will be some approaches for identifying positive patients of COVID-19 that are usually conducted on the basis of respiratory samples and amongst them, X-Ray or radiology images are an essential treatment course. Latest data from the techniques of X-Ray imaging show that these samples contain significant SARS-CoV-2 viruses. information. In order to reliably diagnose this virus, the use of deep learning techniques that is DNN which is also offers advanced imaging instruments and techniques will prove to be useful, as can the issue of the absence of trained rural physicians.

Here, we report two families with immune-associated defects, skin pigmentation abnormalities and neurological deficits that segregate with biallelic DPP9 rare variants. Using patient-derived primary cells and biochemical assays, these variants are shown to behave as hypomorphic or loss-of-function alleles that fail to repress NLRP1. Remarkably, the removal in mice, of a single copy of either Nlrp1a/b/c, Asc, Gsdmd, Il-1r, but not Il-18, was sufficient to rescue the lethality of Dpp9 mutant neonates. These experiments suggest that the deleterious consequences of DPP9 loss are mainly driven by the aberrant activation of the canonical NLRP1 inflammasome and IL-1{beta} signaling. Collectively, our results delineate a Mendelian disorder of DPP9 deficiency driven by increased NLRP1 activity as demonstrated in patient cells and in a mouse model of the disease.","HARAPAS, C.

A five year survey: 1984-1988.,1990,"Introduction: The spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a new public health concern that has shaken the whole world and possesses a challenge to the mental health of the public. This study aimed to investigate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the perceived stress, anxiety level, and mental health of medical students as well as to explore the knowledge of COVID-19 among Indian medical students. Methods: A web-based cross-sectional survey was conducted among the undergraduate medical interns and postgraduate medical residents using the online data collection form. The form consisted of five domains (sociodemographic details, knowledge assessment, perceived stress assessment, generalized anxiety disorder-7 assessment, and assessment of the perceived level of change in social habits and personal hygiene related to COVID-19 outbreak). The statistical analysis of the responses was carried out by the Mann-Whitney U-test and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Results: Two hundred participants filled the distributed survey, 61% (n = 122) were males. The mean knowledge score of 200 participants was 4.27 ± 1.45. The participant had a mean perceived stress score of 18.35 ± 6.28, and the females had a significantly higher perceived stress level than the male (P = 0.037). About 10% (n = 20) of the participants reported high perceived stress level (27-40), and moderate stress (score 14-26) was reported in 69% (n = 138) of the participants. However, only 21% (n = 42) of the participants reported low stress (0-13). While only moderate anxiety (score 10-14) was reported in 16% (n = 32) of the participant and 4% (n = 8) of the participants reported severe anxiety (score >14). Conclusion: There is an increased stress and anxiety in Indian medical students due to overburdened responsibilities and lack of adequate resources. © 2021 Medknow.

Therefore, the aim of this review were to assess and complied the possible impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on African remittances and highlights the key responses undertaken in the continent, which could be useful and provided necessary information on the ongoing COVID-19 pandemics in the continent. To achieve these objectives, in this review, all relevant information were collected through different search engines of PubMed/PMC/Medline, Web of Science, Google Scholar, Scopus, Google, and Science Direct databases. In addition, media news, reports relevant to the topic from local and national governments and international organizations were used. This review revealed that the COVID-19 pandemic is inevitably affecting remittance-dependent African countries through devastating impacts on the global economy in the destination countries, and restrictions on travel and high cost of sending remittances to their home country.As aresult, remittances to Africa are expected to decrease significantly by around 8.8% between 2019 and 2020, from $48 billion to $44 billion. Hence, this review draws practical lessons for African countries to tackle the impacts of COVID-19 pandemic on African remittance inflows. It argues that governments need to design and undertaken comprehensive relief measures, monetary and fiscal policy recovery policies to address problems related to the falling of remittances towards Africa due to the pandemic. Therefore, flexible country level and region-wide collaborative efforts should be made to mitigate the expected decline of remittance inflows to African due to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Kassegn, A.",Cogent Economics &amp; Finance,https://doi.org/10.1080/23322039.2021.1948665,192

We demonstrate the decomposition of disorder on example SARS-CoV-2 and STEAP4 structures, from both crystallographic and cryo-electron microscopy data, and reveal how understanding of the macromolecular disorder leads to deeper understanding of molecular motions and flexibility, and suggests hypotheses for molecular mechanisms.","Pearce, Nicholas M.; Gros, Piet",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.22.436387,192

This study assesses humoral and T-cell responses to mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines in patients treated with rituximab for rheumatic diseases or ocrelizumab for multiple sclerosis (n=37), compared to immunocompetent individuals (n=22). SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies were detectable in only 69.4% of patients and at levels that were significantly lower compared to controls who all seroconverted. In contrast to antibodies, Spike (S)-specific CD4+ T cells were equally detected in immunocompetent and anti-CD20 treated patients (85-90%) and mostly of a Th1 phenotype. Response rates of S-specific CD8+ T cells were higher in ocrelizumab (96.2%) and rituximab-treated patients (81.8%) as compared to controls (66.7%). Vaccine-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were polyfunctional but expressed more IL-2 in patients than in controls.

Within the innate immune response, the plasmacytoid DC (pDC) are the ""professional"" IFN producing cells, expressing specialized toll-like receptors (TLR7 and -9) and high constitutive expression of IRF-7 that allow them to respond to viruses with rapid and extremely robust IFN production; following activation and production of IFN, the pDC subsequently mature into antigen presenting cells that help to shape the adaptive immune response. However, like most cells in the body, the myeloid or conventional DC (mDC or cDC) also produce type I IFNs, albeit typically at a lower level than that observed with pDC, and this IFN is also important in innate and adaptive immunity induced by these classic antigen presenting cells. These two major DC subsets and their IFN products interact both with each other as well as with NK cells, monocytes, T helper cells, T cytotoxic cells, T regulatory cells and B cells to orchestrate the early immune response. This review discusses some of the converging history of DC and IFN as well as mechanisms for IFN induction in DC and the effects of this IFN on the developing immune response.","Fitzgerald-Bocarsly, P; Feng, D",Biochimie,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17544561/,192

The index case, a man in his late twenties, worked in a wet market that was confirmed to be contaminated by the influenza A(H7N9) virus. He developed a consistent fever and severe pneumonia after 4 January 2014. In contrast, the second case, his five-year-old child, who only developed a mild disease 10 days after disease onset of the index case, did not have any contact with poultry and birds but had unprotected and very close contact with the index case. The sequences of the haemagglutinin (HA) genes of the virus stains isolated from the two cases were 100% identical. These findings strongly suggest that the second case might have acquired the infection via transmission of the virus from the sick father. Fortunately, all 40 close contacts, including the other four family members who also had unprotected and very close contact with the cases, did not acquire influenza A(H7N9) virus infection, indicating that the person-to-person transmissibility of the virus remained limited. Our finding underlines the importance of carefully, thoroughly and punctually following-up close contacts of influenza A(H7N9) cases to allow detection of any secondary cases, as these may constitute an early warning signal of the virus's increasing ability to transmit from person-to-person.","Xiao, X C; Li, K B; Chen, Z Q; Di, B; Yang, Z C; Yuan, J; Luo, H B; Ye, S L; Liu, H; Lu, J Y; Nie, Z; Tang, X P; Wang, M; Zheng, B J",Euro surveillance : bulletin Europeen sur les maladies transmissibles = European communicable disease bulletin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24993555/,192

Even in countries where healthcare systems still functioned, patients avoided visiting emergency departments (EDs) because of fears of exposure to COVID-19. OBJECTIVES To describe the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak on admissions of surgical patients from the ED and characteristics of urgent operations performed. METHODS A prospective registry study comparing all patients admitted for acute surgical and trauma care between 15 March and 14 April 2020 (COVID-19) with patients admitted in the parallel time a year previously (control) was conducted. RESULTS The combined cohort included 606 patients. There were 25% fewer admissions during the COVID-19 period (P < 0.0001). The COVID-19 cohort had a longer time interval from onset of symptoms (P < 0.001) and presented in a worse clinical condition as expressed by accelerated heart rate (P = 0.023), leukocyte count disturbances (P = 0.005), higher creatinine, and CRP levels (P < 0.001) compared with the control cohort. More COVID-19 patients required urgent surgery (P = 0.03) and length of ED stay was longer (P = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS During the COVID-19 epidemic, fewer patients presented to the ED requiring acute surgical care. Those who did, often did so in a delayed fashion and in worse clinical condition. More patients required urgent surgical interventions compared to the control period.

A Foresight study.,2005,"The contribution of DRAK2 [death-associated protein kinase (DAPK)-related apoptosis-inducing kinase 2] to anti-viral memory T cell responses following infection with mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) was examined. DRAK2 is a lymphoid-enriched serine/threonine kinase that is an important regulatory molecule involved in modulating T cell responses. Memory T cells derived from MHV-immunized Drak2(-/-) mice exhibited amplified proliferation and IFN-gamma secretion following stimulation with viral epitopes. Transfer of Drak2(-/-) memory T cells into Rag1(-/-) mice infected intracerebrally with MHV resulted in accelerated clearance of virus from the brain. Thus, DRAK2 may be a novel target for stimulating protective immunity to viral pathogens.","Schaumburg, Chris S; Gatzka, Martina; Walsh, Craig M; Lane, Thomas E",Autoimmunity,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17966037/,192

In this study, we prepared 2 purified recombinant HCoV-NL63 RBD proteins using in E. coli system and identified the proteins by Western blotting. We first optimized codon and synthesized the RL (232-684aa)coding gene, then amplified the RL or RS(476-616aa) coding gene via PCR using different primers . The RL or RS coding gene was cloned into the pM48 expression vector fused with TrxA tag. The RBD (RL and RS) of HCoV-NL63 were expressed majorly as inclusion body when expressed in E. coli BL21pLys S under different conditions. The expressed products were purified by affinity chromatography then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Our results showed that the recombinant RBD proteins were maximally expressed at 37 degrees C with 0. 8mM IPTG induction for 4h. RL or RS protein with 95 % purity was obtained and reacted positively with anti-sera from mice immunized with the recombinant vaccinia virus (Tiantan strain) in which HCoV-NL63 RL or RS protein was expressed. In conclusion, the purified recombinant RBD proteins(RL and RS)derived from E. coli were first prepared in China and they might provide a basis for further exploring biological role and vaccine development of HCoV-NL63.","Chang, Hui; Yi, Yao; Zhao, Min; Zhou, Wei-Min; Zhao, Guo-Xia; Wang, Hui-Juan; Bi, Sheng-Li; Gao, Ji-Min; Liu, Bing; Tan, Wen-Jie",Bing du xue bao = Chinese journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23757838/,192
193586,Influence of substituent ribose on transition state affinity in reactions catalyzed by adenosine deaminase.,1977,"In recent years a succession of health emergencies connected with the threat of new, possibly global, infectious diseases has stimulated the attention of the mass media, the scientific community, and international public opinion, setting a tough test for the institutions whose job is to manage the risks. On the basis of experience in the fields of AIDS, BSE, SARS and bird flu, this study discusses the strong and weak points of governance procedures for health risks. In particular, the paper illustrates how risk management can be improved by adopting practices and procedures which actively involve the public in dealing with the emergency, by taking a transparent and accessible approach to communication with the public (including the provision of information about the risks) and by fostering the unrestricted exchange of scientific knowledge among researchers. Lastly, the text shows how the analysis of these themes provides starting points for understanding the crisis in the current relationship between science and society.","Pitrelli, Nico; Sturloni, Giancarlo",Annali dell'Istituto superiore di sanita,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18209267/,192
194082,"Bacteria as potential tools in bioterrorism, with an emphasis on bacterial toxins.",2005,"Early results suggested that the amphotropic murine leukemia virus (A-MLV) does not enter cells via endocytosis through clathrin-coated pits and this gammaretrovirus has therefore been anticipated to fuse directly with the plasma membrane. However, here we present data implicating a caveola-mediated endocytic entry route for A-MLV via its receptor Pit2. Caveolae belong to the cholesterol-rich microdomains characterized by resistance to nonionic detergents such as Triton X-100. Extraction of murine fibroblastic NIH 3T3 cells in cold Triton X-100 showed the presence of the A-MLV receptor Pit2 in detergent-insoluble microdomains. Using coimmunoprecipitation of cell extracts, we were able to demonstrate direct association of Pit2 with caveolin-1, the structural protein of caveolae. Other investigations revealed that A-MLV infection in contrast to vesicular stomatitis virus infection is a slow process (t(1/2) approximately 5 h), which is dependent on plasma membrane cholesterol but independent of NH4Cl treatment of cells; NH4Cl impairs entry via clathrin-coated pits. Furthermore, expression of dominant-negative caveolin-1 decreased the susceptibility to infection via Pit2 by approximately 70%. These results show that A-MLV can enter cells via a caveola-dependent entry route. Moreover, increase in A-MLV infection by treatment with okadaic acid as well as entry of fusion-defective fluorescent A-MLV virions in NIH 3T3 cells further confirmed our findings and show that A-MLV can enter mouse fibroblasts via an endocytic entry route involving caveolae. Finally, we also found colocalization of fusion-defective fluorescent A-MLV virions with caveolin-1 in NIH 3T3 cells. This is the first time substantial evidence has been presented implicating the existence of a caveola-dependent endocytic entry pathway for a retrovirus.","Beer, Christiane; Andersen, Ditte S; Rojek, Aleksandra; Pedersen, Lene",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16051869/,192
196154,Guidelines for the use and interpretation of assays for monitoring autophagy.,2012,"Studies of programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting (-1 PRF) have been approached over the past two decades by many different laboratories using a diverse array of virus-derived frameshift signals in translational assay systems derived from a variety of sources. Though it is generally acknowledged that both absolute and relative -1 PRF efficiency can vary in an assay system-dependent manner, no methodical study of this phenomenon has been undertaken. To address this issue, a series of slippery site mutants of the SARS-associated coronavirus frameshift signal were systematically assayed in four different eukaryotic translational systems. HIV-1 promoted frameshifting was also compared between Escherichia coli and a human T-cell line expression systems. The results of these analyses highlight different aspects of each system, suggesting in general that (1) differences can be due to the assay systems themselves; (2) phylogenetic differences in ribosome structure can affect frameshifting efficiency; and (3) care must be taken to employ the closest phylogenetic match between a specific -1 PRF signal and the choice of translational assay system.","Plant, Ewan P; Dinman, Jonathan D",RNA,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16497657/,192
196581,Basic Shoulder Arthroscopy: Lateral Decubitus Patient Positioning.,2016,"To analyze the pathogenesis of the neurotropic murine coronavirus JHMV, we used monoclonal antibodies to the E2 viral glycoprotein to select antigenic variant viruses. Monoclonal antibodies J.7.2 and J.2.2 were shown to bind to topographically distinct regions of the E2 molecule, and the variants selected with the two antibodies demonstrated very different disease pictures in mice. Variants selected with J.7.2 were, like the parental virus, highly virulent and caused an acute encephalitic illness. By contrast, J.2.2-selected variants predominantly caused a subacute paralytic disease clinically and extensive demyelination histologically. Antigenic differences among the variants and parental virus were readily demonstrable with anti-E2 monoclonal antibodies. However, no differences between the viruses could be shown in binding studies with monoclonal antibodies directed against either E1 or N, the other two JHMV structural proteins. Since only J.2.2 selected demyelinating variants with reduced neurovirulence, it is likely that this monoclonal antibody recognizes a subregion of the E2 molecule that is particularly important in JHMV pathogenesis.","Fleming, J O; Trousdale, M D; el-Zaatari, F A; Stohlman, S A; Weiner, L P",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3701929/,192
196695,Rover barks before Beagle as Mars success lifts NASA's spirits.,2004,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus(SARS-CoV) nucleocapsid (N) protein is one of the four structural proteins of the virus and is predicted to be a 46-kDa phosphoprotein. Our in silico analysis predicted N to be heavily phosphorylated at multiple residues. Experimentally, we have shown in this report that the N protein of the SARS-CoV gets serine-phosphorylated by multiple kinases, in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus. The phosphoprotein is stable and localizes in the cytoplasm and coprecipitates with the membrane fraction. Also, using specific inhibitors of phosphorylation and an in vitro phosphorylation assay, we show that the nucleocapsid protein is a substrate of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK), glycogen synthase kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and casein kinase II. Further, we show that the phosphorylated protein is translocated to the cytoplasm by binding to 14-3-3 (tyrosine 3-monooxygenase/tryptophan 5-monooxygenase activation protein). 14-3-3 proteins are a family of highly conserved, ubiquitously expressed eukaryotic proteins that function primarily as adapters that modulate interactions between components of various cellular signaling and cell cycle regulatory pathways through phosphorylation-dependent protein-protein interactions. Coincidentally, the N protein was also found to downregulate the expression of the theta isoform of 14-3-3 (14-3-3theta), leading to the accumulation of phosphorylated N protein in the nucleus, in the absence of growth factors. Using short interfering RNA specific to 14-3-3theta we have inhibited its expression to show accumulation of phosphorylated N protein in the nucleus. Thus, the data presented here provide a possible mechanism for phosphorylation-dependent nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of the N protein. This 14-3-3-mediated transport of the phosphorylated N protein and its possible implications in interfering with the cellular machinery are discussed.","Surjit, Milan; Kumar, Ravinder; Mishra, Rabi N; Reddy, Malireddy K; Chow, Vincent T K; Lal, Sunil K",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16103198/,192

Patients who faced greater limits to accessing treatment included children. Using a case of a child who was not able to access treatment, I discuss how careproviders might best seek to maintain their emotional bonding with patients and their loved ones, even if they must turn them down for an intervention. I also address whether and when to give patients and their loved ones warning that access to treatment could be limited, using illness caused by COVID-19 as an example of how careproviders may better anticipate patients' needs at all times. Finally, I discuss careproviders' needs. I suggest that medical professionals' culture should make it as easy as possible for them to acknowledge their feelings of vulnerability, so that they may better determine, in times of disaster, whether they should treat or triage patients. Careproviders who triage may choose to share with patients and loved ones that they also feel pain when they deny patients an intervention.","Howe, Edmund G",The Journal of clinical ethics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34548427/,192

The most important goals were to prevent the risk of infection in the professionals, in families and their newborns, as well as to ensure the same effectiveness for the early detection of the diseases included in our programme. To this end, the laboratory was reorganised by dividing the staff into groups and the spaces were redistributed. It was also necessary to modify several protocols and circuits, especially for the management of early discharges from maternity centres, and for the collection of the necessary second samples (from newborns with inconclusive results or for low quality samples). In general, a 36% reduction in the time of arrival of these second samples at the laboratory was achieved with respect to the previous circuit. In the specific case of cystic fibrosis detection, the implementation of a new strategy meant a 100% reduction in the request for second samples and a 70% reduction in the age of diagnosis of the newborn. After evaluating these changes, it can be concluded that in the face of the pandemic, the NSP of Catalonia showed determined leadership, aligning all its professionals, ensuring the continuity of the activity in the programme and generating new opportunities. The new processes and circuits implemented have been definitively consolidated, improving the efficiency of the programme.","Argudo Ramírez, Ana; González de Aledo Castillo, José Manuel; Marín Soria, José Luis; López Galera, Rosa María; Pajares García, Sonia; Richard, Sabine; Bádenas Orquín, Célia; Martínez Bueno, Cristina; Falguera Puig, Gemma; Prats Viedma, Blanca; Asso Ministral, Laia; García Villoria, Judit",Revista espanola de salud publica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33323921/,192

Cellular survival and death signaling events following coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) infection have been studied in relationship to viral replication, but the role of SAPKs has not been scrutinized. In this study, we found that the phosphorylation of JNK1/2 and p38 MAPK was increased during active replication of CVB3 and that their phosphorylation was independent of CVB3-induced caspase activation or production of reactive oxygen species. The roles of these kinases in CVB3 infection were further evaluated using specific inhibitors: SP600125 for JNK1/2 and SB203580 for p38 MAPK. JNK1/2 inhibitors reduced CVB3-induced phosphorylation of activating transcription factor 2, and the p38 MAPK inhibitor reduced CVB3-induced phosphorylation of heat shock protein 27. Although inhibition of these kinases by specific inhibitors did not affect CVB3 viral protein synthesis, inhibition of p38 MAPK but not of JNK1/2 resulted in significant reduction of viral progeny release, suppression of CVB3-induced cell death, and blockage of CVB3-induced caspase-3 activation in infected cells. We conclude that SAPK pathways play critical roles in the life cycle of CVB3, particularly in viral progeny release.","Si, Xiaoning; Luo, Honglin; Morgan, Andrew; Zhang, Jingchun; Wong, Jerry; Yuan, Ji; Esfandiarei, Mitra; Gao, Guang; Cheung, Caroline; McManus, Bruce M",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16254323/,192

We sought to determine the significance of black race, pre-existing cardiovascular disease (pCVD), and acute kidney injury (AKI) on cardiopulmonary outcomes and in-hospital mortality of COVID-19 patients. METHODS We conducted a retrospective cohort study of blacks with/without pCVD and with/without in-hospital AKI, hospitalized within Grady Memorial Hospital in Georgia between February and July 2020, who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on qualitative polymerase-chain-reaction assay. The primary outcome was a composite of in-hospital cardiac events. RESULTS Of the 293 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in this study, 71 were excluded from the primary analysis (for race/ethnicity other than black non-Hispanic). Of the 222 hospitalized COVID-19 patients included in our analyses, 41.4% were female, 78.8% had pCVD, and 30.6% developed AKI during the admission. In multivariable analyses, pCVD (OR 4.7, 95% CI 1.5-14.8, P=0.008) and AKI (OR 2.7, 95% CI 1.3-5.5, P=0.006) were associated with increased odds of in-hospital cardiac events. AKI was associated with increased odds of in-hospital mortality (OR 8.9, 95% CI 3.3-23.9, P<0.0001). The presence of AKI was associated with increased odds of ICU stay, mechanical ventilation, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). CONCLUSION pCVD and AKI were associated with higher risk of in-hospital cardiac events, and AKI was associated with a higher risk of in-hospital mortality in blacks.","Egbuche, Obiora; Jegede, Opeyemi; Abe, Temidayo; Wagle, Bivek; Huynh, Ky; Hayes, Dolphurs; Campbell, Martin Luther; Mezue, Kenechukwu; Ram, Pradhum; Nwokike, Shirley I; Desai, Rupak; Effoe, Valery; Kpodonu, Jacques; Morgan, Jayne; Ofili, Elizabeth; Onwuanyi, Anekwe; Echols, Melvin R",American journal of cardiovascular disease,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34084656/,192

Due to privacy reasons, most of the users will not disclose their location. Detecting the location of the tweet users is required to track the geographic location of the spreading diseases. This work aims to detect the spreading location of the COVID-19 disease from the Twitter users and content discussed in the tweet. COVID-19 is a disease caused by the ""novel coronavirus."" About 80% of confirmed cases recover from the disease. However, one out of every six people who get COVID-19 can become seriously ill, stated by the World health organization. Inferring the user location for identifying the spreading location for the disease is a very challenging task. This paper proposes a new technique based on a hypergraph model to detect the Twitter user's locations based on the spreading disease. This model uses hypergraph with weighting factor technique to infer the spreading disease's spatial location. The accuracy of prediction can be improved when a massive volume of streaming data is analyzed. The Helly property of the hypergraph was applied to discard less potential words from the text analysis, which claims this work of unique nature. A weighting factor was introduced to calculate the score of each location for a particular user. The location of each user is predicted based on the one that possesses the highest weighting factor. The proposed framework has been evaluated and tested for various measures like precision, recall and F-measure. The promising results obtained have substantiated the claim for this work compared to the state-of-the-art methodologies.","Pradeepa, S; Manjula, K R",J Supercomput,,192

Generally, antibodies are utilized as the biorecognition molecules in the LFA. However, antibodies selected using an in vivo process not only may risk killing the animal hosts and causing errors between different batches but also their range is restricted by the refrigerated conditions used to store them. To avoid these limitations, aptamers screened by an in vitro process have been studied as biorecognition molecules in LFAs. Based on the sandwich or competitive format, the aptamer-based LFA can accomplish on-site detection of target analytes. Since aptamers have a distinctive ability to undergo conformational changes, the adsorption-desorption format has also been exploited to detect target analytes in aptamer-based LFAs. This paper reviews developments in aptamer-based LFAs in the last three years for the detection of target analytes. Three formats of aptamer-based LFAs, i.e., sandwich, competitive, and adsorption-desorption, are described in detail. Based on these formats, signal amplification strategies and multiplexed detection are discussed in order to provide an overview of aptamer-based LFAs for on-site detection of target analytes. In addition, the potential commercialization and future perspectives of aptamer-based LFAs for rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 are given to support the COVID-19 pandemic.","Huang, Lei; Tian, Shulin; Zhao, Wenhao; Liu, Ke; Ma, Xing; Guo, Jinhong",Biosens Bioelectron,,192

However, few studies investigated liver injury in COVID-19 patients with chronic liver diseases. We described the clinical features in COVID-19 patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Methods: Confirmed COVID-19 patients from hospitals in 10 cities of Jiangsu province, China were retrospectively included between January 18, 2020, and February 26, 2020. Hepatic Steatosis Index (HSI) was used to defined NAFLD. Results: A total of 280 COVID-19 patients were enrolled. Eighty-six (30.7%) of 280 COVID-19 patients were diagnosed as NAFLD by HSI. 100 (35.7%) patients presented abnormal liver function on admission. The median ALT levels (34.5 U/L vs. 23.0 U/L, P<0.001) and the proportion of elevated ALT (>40 U/L) (40.7% vs. 10.8%, P<0.001) were significantly higher in patients with NAFLD than in patients without NAFLD on admission. The proportion of elevated ALT in patients with NAFLD was also significantly higher than patients without NAFLD (65.1% vs. 38.7%, P<0.001) during hospitalization. Multivariate analysis showed that age over 50 years (odds ratio [OR] 2.077, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.183-3.648, P=0.011), and concurrent NAFLD (OR 2.956, 95% CI 1.526-5.726, P=0.001) were independent risk factors of ALT elevation in COVID-19 patients, while the atomized inhalation of interferon &#945;-2b (OR 0.402, 95%CI 0.236-0.683, P=0.001) was associated with the reduced risk of ALT elevation during hospitalization. No patient developed liver failure or death during hospitalization. The complications and clinical outcomes were comparable between COVID-19 patients with and without NAFLD. Conclusions: NAFLD patients are more likely to develop liver injury when infected by COVID-19. However, no patient developed severe liver-related complications during hospitalization.","Huang, Rui; Zhu, Li; Wang, Jian; Xue, Leyang; Liu, Longgen; Yan, Xuebing; Huang, Songping; Li, Yang; Yan, Xiaomin; Zhang, Biao; Xu, Tianmin; Li, Chunyang; Ji, Fang; Ming, Fang; Zhao, Yun; Cheng, Juan; Wang, Yinling; Zhao, Haiyan; Hong, Shuqin; Chen, Kang; Zhao, Xiang-An; Zou, Lei; Sang, Dawen; Shao, Huaping; Guan, Xinying; Chen, Xiaobing; Chen, Yuxin; Wei, Jie; Zhu, Chuanwu; Wu, Chao",,,192

Using a multidisciplinary approach, we identified and validated the hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease inhibitor simeprevir as an especially promising repurposable drug for treating COVID-19. Simeprevir potently reduces SARS-CoV-2 viral load by multiple orders of magnitude and synergizes with remdesivir in vitro. Mechanistically, we showed that simeprevir not only inhibits the main protease (Mpro) and unexpectedly the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) but also modulates host immune responses.

As a result, there has been considerable economic distress globally and a significant loss of life. Sadly, the vulnerable and immunocompromised in our societies seem to be more susceptible to severe COVID-19 complications. Global public health bodies and governments have ignited strategies and issued advisories on various handwashing and hygiene guidelines, social distancing strategies, and, in the most extreme cases, some countries have adopted ""stay in place"" or lockdown protocols to prevent COVID-19 spread. Notably, there are several significant risk factors for severe COVID-19 infection. These include the presence of poor nutritional status and pre-existing noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) such as diabetes mellitus, chronic lung diseases, cardiovascular diseases (CVD), obesity, and various other diseases that render the patient immunocompromised. These diseases are characterized by systemic inflammation, which may be a common feature of these NCDs, affecting patient outcomes against COVID-19. In this review, we discuss some of the anti-inflammatory therapies that are currently under investigation intended to dampen the cytokine storm of severe COVID-19 infections. Furthermore, nutritional status and the role of diet and lifestyle is considered, as it is known to affect patient outcomes in other severe infections and may play a role in COVID-19 infection. This review speculates the importance of nutrition as a mitigation strategy to support immune function amid the COVID-19 pandemic, identifying food groups and key nutrients of importance that may affect the outcomes of respiratory infections.","Zabetakis, Ioannis; Lordan, Ronan; Norton, Catherine; Tsoupras, Alexandros",Nutrients,,192

210645,Economic and Non-Economic Variables Affecting Fraud in European Countries,2021,"SARS-CoV-2 has infected over 128 million people worldwide, and until a vaccine is developed and widely disseminated, vigilant testing and contact tracing are the most effective ways to slow the spread of COVID-19. Typical clinical testing only confirms the presence or absence of the virus, but rather, a simple and rapid testing procedure that sequences the entire genome would be impactful and allow for tracing the spread of the virus and variants, as well as the appearance of new variants. However, traditional short read sequencing methods are time consuming and expensive. Herein, we describe a tiled genome array that we developed for rapid and inexpensive full viral genome resequencing, and we have applied our SARS-CoV-2-specific genome tiling array to rapidly and accurately resequence the viral genome from eight clinical samples. We have resequenced eight samples acquired from patients in Wyoming that tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. We were ultimately able to sequence over 95% of the genome of each sample with greater than 99.9% average accuracy.","Hoff, Kendall; Ding, Xun; Carter, Lucas; Duque, John; Lin, Ju-Yu; Dung, Samantha; Singh, Priyanka; Sun, Jiayi; Crnogorac, Filip; Swaminathan, Radha; Alden, Emily N; Zhu, Xuechen; Shimada, Ryota; Posavi, Marijan; Hull, Noah; Dinwiddie, Darrell; Halasz, Adam M; McGall, Glenn; Zhou, Wei; Edwards, Jeremy S",Langmuir,,192

However, most published CAD methods treat lung cancer diagnosis as a lung nodule classification problem, which does not reflect clinical practice, where clinicians diagnose a patient based on a set of images of nodules, instead of one specific nodule. Besides, the low interpretability of the output provided by these methods presents an important barrier for their adoption. In this article, we treat lung cancer diagnosis as a multiple instance learning (MIL) problem in order to better reflect the diagnosis process in the clinical setting and for the higher interpretability of the output. We chose radiomics as the source of input features and deep attention-based MIL as the classification algorithm.The attention mechanism provides higher interpretability by estimating the importance of each instance in the set for the final diagnosis.In order to improve the model's performance in a small imbalanced dataset, we introduce a new bag simulation method for MIL.The results show that our method can achieve a mean accuracy of 0.807 with a standard error of the mean (SEM) of 0.069, a recall of 0.870 (SEM 0.061), a positive predictive value of 0.928 (SEM 0.078), a negative predictive value of 0.591 (SEM 0.155) and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.842 (SEM 0.074), outperforming other MIL methods.Additional experiments show that the proposed oversampling strategy significantly improves the model's performance. In addition, our experiments show that our method provides an indication of the importance of each nodule in determining the diagnosis, which combined with the well-defined radiomic features, make the results more interpretable and acceptable for doctors and patients.","Chen, Junhua; Zeng, Haiyan; Zhang, Chong; Shi, Zhenwei; Dekker, Andre; Wee, Leonard; Bermejo, Inigo",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.14655v1.pdf,192

Nosocomial infection of COVID­19 directly impacts the quality of life of patients, as well as results in extra expenditure to hospitals. It has been shown that COVID­19 is more likely to transmit via close, unprotected contact with infected patients. Additionally, current preventative and containment measures tend to overlook asymptomatic individuals and superspreading events. Since the mode of transmission and real origin of COVID­19 in hospitals has not been fully elucidated yet, minimizing nosocomial infection in hospitals remains a difficult but urgent task for healthcare professionals. Healthcare professionals globally should form an alliance against nosocomial COVID­19 infections. The fight against COVID­19 may provide valuable lessons for the future prevention and control of nosocomial infections. The present review will discuss some of the key strategies to prevent and control hospital­based nosocomial COVID­19 infections.","Du, Qiu; Zhang, Dingding; Hu, Weimin; Li, Xuefei; Xia, Qiongrong; Wen, Taishen; Jia, Haiping",Int J Mol Med,,192

Among posttranslational modifications initiated at the ER level, glycosylation is the most common reaction. However, our understanding of the impact of glycosylation on the ER structure remains unclear. Here, we show that exostosin-1 (EXT1) glycosyltransferase, an enzyme involved in N-glycosylation, is a key regulator of ER morphology and dynamics. We have integrated multiomics and superresolution imaging to characterize the broad effect of EXT1 inactivation, including the ER shape-dynamics-function relationships in mammalian cells. We have observed that inactivating EXT1 induces cell enlargement and enhances metabolic switches such as protein secretion. In particular, suppressing EXT1 in mouse thymocytes causes developmental dysfunctions associated with the ER network extension. Last, our data illuminate the physical and functional aspects of the ER proteome-glycome-lipidome structure axis, with implications in biotechnology and medicine.","Kerselidou, Despoina; Dohai, Bushra Saeed; Nelson, David R; Daakour, Sarah; De Cock, Nicolas; Hassoun, Zahra Al Oula; Kim, Dae-Kyum; Olivet, Julien; El Assal, Diana C; Jaiswal, Ashish; Alzahmi, Amnah; Saha, Deeya; Pain, Charlotte; Matthijssens, Filip; Lemaitre, Pierre; Herfs, Michael; Chapuis, Julien; Ghesquiere, Bart; Vertommen, Didier; Kriechbaumer, Verena; Knoops, Kèvin; Lopez-Iglesias, Carmen; van Zandvoort, Marc; Lambert, Jean-Charles; Hanson, Julien; Desmet, Christophe; Thiry, Marc; Lauersen, Kyle J; Vidal, Marc; Van Vlierberghe, Pieter; Dequiedt, Franck; Salehi-Ashtiani, Kourosh; Twizere, Jean-Claude",Sci.

PURPOSE: There are currently no FDA-approved medications for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). At the onset of the pandemic, off-label medication use was supported by limited or no clinical data. We sought to characterize experimental COVID-19 therapies and identify safety signals during this period. METHODS: We conducted a noninterventional, multicenter, point prevalence study of patients hospitalized with suspected/confirmed COVID-19. Clinical and treatment characteristics within a 24-hour window were evaluated in a random sample of up to 30 patients per site. The primary objective was to describe COVID-19-targeted therapies. The secondary objective was to describe adverse drug reactions (ADRs). RESULTS: A total of 352 patients treated for COVID-19 at 15 US hospitals From April 18 to May 8, 2020, were included in the study. Most patients were treated at academic medical centers (53.4%) or community hospitals (42.6%). Sixty-seven patients (19%) were receiving drug therapy in addition to supportive care. Drug therapies used included hydroxychloroquine (69%), remdesivir (10%), and interleukin-6 antagonists (9%). Five patients (7.5%) were receiving combination therapy. The rate of use of COVID-19-directed drug therapy was higher in patients with vs patients without a history of asthma (14.9% vs 7%, P = 0.037) and in patients enrolled in clinical trials (26.9% vs 3.2%, P < 0.001). Among those receiving drug therapy, 8 patients (12%) experienced an ADR, and ADRs were recognized at a higher rate in patients enrolled in clinical trials (62.5% vs 22%; odds ratio, 5.9; P = 0.028). CONCLUSION: While we observed high rates of supportive care for patients with COVID-19, we also found that ADRs were common among patients receiving drug therapy, including those enrolled in clinical trials.

224514,Reply,2020,"BACKGROUND: In the initial phase of the Covid-19 pandemic, difficult decisions had to be made on the allocation of testing resources. Similar situations can arise in future pandemics. Therefore, careful consideration of who should be tested is an important part of pandemic preparedness. We focus on four ethical aspects of that problem: how to prioritize scarce testing resources, the regulation of commercial direct-to-consumer test services, testing of unauthorized immigrants, and obligatory testing. MAIN TEXT: The distribution of scarce resources for testing: We emphasize the use of needs-based criteria, but also acknowledge the importance of choosing a testing strategy that contributes efficiently to stopping the overall spread of the disease. Commercial direct-to-consumer test services: Except in cases of acute scarcity, such services will in practice have to be allowed. We propose that they should be subject to regulation that ensures test quality and adequate information to users. Testing of unauthorized immigrants, their children and other people with unclear legal status: Like everyone else, these individuals may be in need of testing, and it is in society's interest to reach them with testing in order to stop the spread of the disease. A society that offers comprehensive medical services to unauthorized immigrants is in a much better position to reach them in a pandemic than a society that previously excluded them from healthcare. Obligatory testing: While there are often strong reasons for universal testing in residential areas or on workplaces, there are in most cases better ways to achieve testing coverage than to make testing mandatory. CONCLUSION: In summary, we propose (1) decision-making primarily based on needs-based criteria, (2) strict regulation but not prohibition of direct-to-consumer test services, (3) test services offered to unauthorized immigrants, preferably as part of comprehensive medical services, and (4) broad outreach of testing services whenever possible, but in general not obligatory testing.","Hansson, Sven Ove; Helgesson, Gert; Juth, Niklas",BMC Med Ethics,,192

226580,Effects of fluorescent carbon dots from the baked lamb on energy and lipid metabolism,2020,"A particular focus on numerous sites around the UK was on “virtual wards” for people with respiratory covid-19 symptoms, who didn’t need to remain in an acute hospital bed just so that their symptoms and oxygen saturations could be monitored.6 These measures combine remote or self-monitoring of oxygen saturations, reporting of symptoms with telephone support, and the ability for immediate recall if a patient deteriorates.7 They’ve helped thousands of people remain out of hospital. NHS England’s covid-19 discharge policy, as well as locally led innovation and an additional £648m for step-down community services during the pandemic, anecdotally led to much slicker access to community services, whose capacity had been boosted (although data collection on delayed transfers of care were suspended).10 The use of “discharge to assess” bedded facilities also became popular, where people’s ongoing care needs could be determined after a spell of observation outside the alien acute care setting. 5 Reschen ME Bowen J Singh S.

228106,Functional traits provide new insight into recovery and succession at deep-sea hydrothermal vents,2021,"Since December 2019, humankind has been experiencing a ravaging severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak, the second coronavirus pandemic in a decade after the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) disease in 2012. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 results in Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is responsible for over 2.13.1 million deaths worldwide. With the emergence of a second and a third wave of infection across the globe, and the rising record of multiple reinfections and relapses, SARS-CoV-2 infection shows no sign of abating. In addition, it is now evident that SARS-CoV-2 infection presents with neurological symptoms that include early hyposmia, ischemic stroke, meningitis, delirium and falls, even after viral clearance. This may suggest chronic or permanent changes to the neurons, glial cells, and/or brain vasculature in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19. Within the central nervous system (CNS), microglia act as the central housekeepers against altered homeostatic states, including during viral neurotropic infections. In this review, we highlight microglial responses to viral neuroinfections, especially those with a similar genetic composition and route of entry as SARS-CoV-2. As the primary sensor of viral infection in the CNS, we describe the pathogenic and neuroinvasive mechanisms of RNA viruses and SARS-CoV-2 vis-à-vis the microglial means of viral recognition. Responses of microglia which may culminate in viral clearance or immunopathology are also covered. Lastly, we further discuss the implication of SARS-CoV-2 CNS invasion on microglial plasticity and associated long-term neurodegeneration. As such, this review provides insight into some of the mechanisms by which microglia could contribute to the pathophysiology of post-COVID-19 neurological sequelae and disorders, including Parkinson’s disease, which could be pervasive in the coming years given the growing numbers of infected and re-infected individuals globally.","Awogbindin, Ifeoluwa O.; Ben-Azu, Benneth Olusola Babatunde A.; Akinluyi, Elizabeth T.; Adeniyi, Philip A.; Di Paolo, Therese Tremblay Marie-Ève",Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience,,192
228620,"Antimicrobial TiO2 nanocomposite coatings for surfaces, dental and orthopaedic implants",2021,"OBJECTIVES: To develop and validate a radiomic model to predict the rapid progression (defined as volume growth of pneumonia lesions > 50% within seven days) in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: Patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who underwent longitudinal chest CT between January 01 and February 18, 2020 were included. A total of 1316 radiomic features were extracted from the lung parenchyma window for each CT. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), Relief, Las Vegas Wrapper (LVW), L1-norm-Support Vector Machine (L1-norm-SVM), and recursive feature elimination (RFE) were applied to select the features that associated with rapid progression. Four machine learning classifiers were used for modeling, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LR), and Decision Tree (DT). Accordingly, 20 radiomic models were developed on the basis of 296 CT scans and validated in 74 CT scans. Model performance was determined by the receiver operating characteristic curve. RESULTS: A total of 107 patients (median age, 49.0 years, interquartile range, 35-54) were evaluated. The patients underwent a total of 370 chest CT scans with a median interval of 4 days (interquartile range, 3-5 days). The combination methods of L1-norm SVM and SVM with 17 radiomic features yielded the highest performance in predicting the likelihood of rapid progression of pneumonia lesions on next CT scan, with an AUC of 0.857 (95% CI: 0.766-0.947), sensitivity of 87.5%, and specificity of 70.7%. CONCLUSIONS: Our radiomic model based on longitudinal chest CT data could predict the rapid progression of pneumonia lesions, which may facilitate the CT follow-up intervals and reduce the radiation. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: Radiomic features extracted from the current chest CT have potential in predicting the likelihood of rapid progression of pneumonia lesions on the next chest CT, which would improve clinical decision-making regarding timely treatment.","Zhang, Bin; Ni-Jia-Ti, Ma-Yi-di-Li; Yan, Ruike; An, Nan; Chen, Lv; Liu, Shuyi; Chen, Luyan; Chen, Qiuying; Li, Minmin; Chen, Zhuozhi; You, Jingjing; Dong, Yuhao; Xiong, Zhiyuan; Zhang, Shuixing",Br J Radiol,,192
229367,Automatic Y-axis Rescaling in Dynamic Visualizations,2021-09-20,"Introduction: Introduction: in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients nutritional requirements are increased. These patients present symptoms that make food intake and nutrient absorption difficult, therefore involving nutritional risk. On the other hand, acute respiratory complications require prolonged ICU stays, and this predisposes to increased malnutrition and loss of skeletal muscle mass and function, which can lead to poor quality of life, disability and morbidity long after discharge. For this reason, the world's leading nutrition societies and associations believe that nutritional therapy should be considered a part of the basic treatment of patients with COVID-19. Methods: we have reviewed and compared 9 expert recommendations (ER) published by nutrition societies and associations from China, Spain, Brazil, Europe, Colombia, Australia, America, and the United Kingdom, in relation to critical and non-critical hospitalized patients due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusions: the 9 ERs reviewed agree on the importance of nutritional management in critical and non-critical hospitalized patients with COVID-19, as well as on the early detection of nutritional risk, the intervention, and subsequent follow-up. Even so, each published document has its own particularities and puts a special stress on some specific aspect.","Martínez Rodríguez, Jéssica; Roca Fontbona, Maria",Nutr Hosp,,192

234428,The coming transformation of the electricity sector: A conversation with Amory Lovins,2020,"BACKGROUND: The clinical course and viral detection period in mild or asymptomatic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients are not yet known. The presumed low diagnostic sensitivity of upper respiratory specimens for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) makes it difficult to confirm infection and recommend de-isolation. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test results of mild or asymptomatic COVID-19 patients who were admitted at the Daegu-Gyeongbuk 7th community treatment centre in Korea between 9 March 2020 and 10 April 2020. Patients underwent an upper respiratory RT-PCR test every week until discharge. From the RT-PCR results, we evaluated the rate of prolonged (>3 weeks) SARS-CoV-2 RNA positivity. We analysed the proportion of reversed results, defined as a positive or indeterminate result one day after a negative RT-PCR result, according to time (<14, 15-21, 22-28, >28 days) from the initial positive RT-PCR result. RESULTS: In 23% (69/300) of patients, SARS-CoV-2 was detected more than 3 weeks after the initial positive RT-PCR. In 14% (42/300) of patients, the RT-PCR results were positive for more than 4 weeks. For 37.5% (152/405) of negative RT-PCR results, the results were reversed in the next day's test. And 43.5% (123/283) of negative RT-PCR results were reversed within 3 weeks of diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: The detection of SARS-CoV-2 lasting more than 3 weeks was common in mild or asymptomatic patients. Upper respiratory RT-PCR results were frequently reversed from negative to positive.","Kim, Sung-Min; Hwang, Yoon Jin; Kwak, Youngseok",Infect Dis (Lond),,192

METHOD: The data of 16 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients with CML receiving TKI and age, gender, and comorbid disease matched COVID-19 patients without cancer at a 3/1 ratio (n = 48), diagnosed between March 11, 2020 and May 22, 2020 and included in the Republic of Turkey, Ministry of Health database, were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: The rates of intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and mechanical ventilation (MV) support were lower in CML patients compared to the control group, however, these differences did not achieve statistical significance (p = 0.1, and p = 0.2, respectively). The length of hospital stay was shorter in CML patients compared with the control group; however, it was not statistically significant (p = 0.8). The case fatality rate (CFR) in COVID-19 patients with CML was 6.3%, and it was 12.8% in the control group. Although the CFR in CML patients with COVID-19 was lower compared to the control group, this difference did not achieve statistical significance (p = 0.5). When CML patients were divided into 3 groups according to the TKI, no significant difference was observed regarding the rate of ICU admission, MV support, CFR, the length of stay in both hospital and ICU (all p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: This study highlights that large scale prospective and randomized studies should be conducted in order to investigate the role of TKIs in the treatment of COVID-19.","Basci, Semih; Ata, Naim; Altuntas, Fevzi; Yigenoglu, Tugçe Nur; Dal, Mehmet Sinan; Korkmaz, Serdal; Namdaroglu, Sinem; Bastürk, Abdülkadir; Hacibekiroglu, Tuba; Dogu, Mehmet Hilmi; Berber, Ilhami; Dal, Kürsat; Erkurt, Mehmet Ali; Turgut, Burhan; Çaglayan, Murat; Ayvali, Mustafa Okan; Çelik, Osman; Ülgü, Mustafa Mahir; Birinci, Suayip",J Oncol Pharm Pract,,192

Sewage surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 has been suggested as tool to determine the extent of COVID-19 in cities and serve as early warning for (re-)emergence of SARS-CoV-2 circulation in communities. The focus of this review is on the strength of evidence, opportunities and challenges for the application of sewage surveillance to inform public health decision making. Considerations for undertaking sampling programs are reviewed including sampling sites, strategies, sample transport, storage and quantification methods; together with the approach and evidence base for quantifying prevalence of infection from measured wastewater concentration. Published SARS-CoV-2 sewage surveillance studies (11 peer reviewed, and 10 pre-prints) were reviewed to demonstrate the current status of implementation to support public health decisions. Whilst being very promising, a number of areas were identified requiring additional research to further strengthen this approach and take full advantage of its potential. In particular, design of adequate sampling strategies, spatial and temporal resolution of sampling, sample storage, replicate sampling and analysis, controls for the molecular methods used for quantification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater. The use of appropriate prevalence data and methods to correlate or even translate SARS-CoV-2 concentrations in wastewater to prevalence of virus shedders in the population is discussed.","Medema, Gertjan; Been, Frederic; Heijnen, Leo; Petterson, Susan",,,192
237043,Informing Agility in the Context of Organizational Changes,2021,"INTRODUCTION: The use of online learning and subsequent online testing has expanded rapidly in pharmacy programs across the United States. Numerous published studies have compared online learning with traditional methods in pharmacy. However, no such studies have been published in pharmacy. This study's objective is to compare first-professional year student preferences for computer-based vs. traditional paper-and-pencil testing for a required social and administrative pharmacy class. METHODS: All students enrolled in the class were invited to complete one brief survey at the end of the semester to determine their testing preference. RESULTS: Of the 138 first-professional year students completing the survey, 79% (109 of 138) preferred computer-based testing, 9% had no preference, 6% (8 of 138) preferred paper-and-pencil testing, and the remainder (8 of 138) stated it depended on what was being tested. Ninety-one percent of students did not perceive the testing method to impact their grades. Students preferred computer-based testing over traditional paper-and-pencil as a convenient testing method (mean 4.73 vs. 3.4, P < .001), providing immediate feedback (mean 4.87 vs. 1.91, P < .001), and as a more effective testing method (mean 4.57 vs. 3.96, P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: First-professional year students preferred computer-based over traditional paper-and-pencil testing for a social and administrative science class, with the method of testing not perceived to impact grade. This finding is timely, given the recent required transitioning of all pharmacy classes and subsequent testing to an online format due to the coronavirus disease of 2019 pandemic.","Franic, Duska M; Palmer, Russ; Fulford, Michael",Curr Pharm Teach Learn,,192

METHODS: We studied a cohort of 494,753 adults in 6,515 NHs in France exposed to COVID-19 pandemic (from March 1st to May 31st, 2020) and compared with the 2014-2019 cohorts using data from the French National Health Data System. The main outcome was death. Excess deaths and standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were estimated. RESULT: There were 13,505 excess deaths. Mortality increased by 43% (SMR: 1.43). The mortality excess was higher among males than females (SMR: 1.51 and 1.38) and decreased with increasing age (SMRs in females: 1.61 in the 60-74 age group, 1.58 for 75-84, 1.41 for 85-94, and 1.31 for 95 or over; Males: SMRs: 1.59 for 60-74, 1.69 for 75-84, 1.47 for 85-94, and 1.41 for 95 or over). No mortality displacement effect was observed up until August 30th,2020. By extrapolating to all NH residents nationally (N = 570,003), we estimated that they accounted for 51% of the general population excess deaths (N = 15,114 out of 29,563). CONCLUSION: NH residents accounted for half of the total excess deaths in France during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. The excess death rate was higher among males than females and among younger than older residents.","Canouï-Poitrine, Florence; Rachas, Antoine; Thomas, Martine; Carcaillon-Bentata, Laure; Fontaine, Roméo; Gavazzi, Gaëtan; Laurent, Marie; Robine, Jean-Marie",Age ageing,,192

A novel virus, now called SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2) was isolated from lower respiratory tract samples. The current outbreak of infection has spread to over 100 countries and killed more 340,000 people as of 25th May, 2020. The predominant clinical manifestation of COVID-19 is respiratory disease- ranging from mild flu-like symptoms to fulminant pneumonia and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Patients with pre-existing cardiovascular risk factors are considered more susceptible to the virus, and these conditions are often worsened by the infection. Further, COVID-19 infection has led to de novo cardiac complications like acute myocardial injury and arrhythmias. In this review, we have focused on the cardiovascular manifestations of COVID-19 infection that have been reported in literature so far. We have also outlined the effect of pre-existing cardiovascular disease and well as risk factors on the clinical course and outcomes of COVID-19 infection.","Nandy, Sneha; Wan, Siu-Hin; Brenes-Salazar, Jorge",Current cardiology reviews (Online),,192

240119,Program and Abstracts for 2020 Annual Meeting of the Society for Glycobiology,2020,"A variety of serological tests have been developed to detect the presence of antibodies against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We evaluated the performance of 18 commercially available SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays. Early (6-8 days after the start of symptoms) and late sera (>14 days) from ICU patients (n=10 and n=16, respectively) and healthcare workers (n=5 and n=9, respectively) were included. Additionally, 22 sera were included to detect potential cross-reactivity. Test characteristics were determined for the 18 assays. In >14 days samples, the Vircell IgG and Wantai Ig ELISAs had superior sensitivity compared to the other ELISAs (96%). Furthermore, the Roche Ig, the Epitope Diagnostics IgM, Wantai IgM, Euroimmun IgG, and IgA all showed a specificity of 100%. The POCTs of Boson Biotech and ACRO Biotech showed the highest sensitivities: 100% and 96% (83.5-99.8), respectively. The POCT of Orient Gene Biotech, VOMED Diagnostics, and Coris-Bioconcept showed highest specificities (100%). For the IgM and IgA assays, the Euroimmun IgA test showed the highest sensitivity in early samples: 46.7% (23.5-70.9) to 53.3% (29.1-76.5). In general, all tests performed better in patients with severe symptoms (ICU patients). We conclude that the Wantai Ig and Vircell IgG ELISAs may be suitable for diagnostic purposes. The IgM/IgA tests performed poorer than their IgG/Ig counterparts but may have a role in diagnoses of SARS-CoV-2 in a population in which the background seroprevalence of IgG high, and IgM and/or IgA may distinguish between acute or past infection.","Hanssen, Daniëlle A T; Slaats, Michiel; Mulder, Marlies; Savelkoul, Paul H M; van Loo, Inge H M",Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis,,192

241373,Synergistic effect of modified Pd-based cobalt chromite and manganese oxide system towards NO-CO redox detoxification reaction,2020,"Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic the use of the term ""hero"" has been widespread. This is especially common in the context of healthcare workers and it is now unremarkable to see large banners on hospital exteriors that say ""heroes work here"". There is more to be gleaned from the rhetoric of heroism than just awareness of public appreciation, however. Calling physicians and nurses heroes for treating sick people indicates something about the concept of medicine and medical professionals. In this essay, I will examine three aspects of the social role of medicine exposed by the language of heroism. One, if a hero is someone who goes above and the call of duty, then does that mean exposing oneself to risk of infection is no longer a duty of physicians (as it used to be)? If so, does that mean the ""profession"" of medicine is much like any other business? Two, physicians and nurses are not the only ""heroes"" this go-around. Anyone deemed essential to the US ""infrastructure"" is designated by the US government as having ""special responsibilities"" to remain at their posts for the public good, which explicitly puts physicians in the same category as sewage workers and grocery store cashiers. Three, what does it mean to belong to a profession that does (or does not) have self-sacrifice and risk-taking as part of its mission-especially a profession that rarely gets called upon to practice these obligations?","Hopkins, Patrick D",HEC forum,,192

242630,Tempered Stable Autoregressive Models,2021-06-06,"Oncologists should recognise the need to move beyond the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) score. ECOG PS is a longstanding and ubiquitous feature of oncology. It was evolved 40 years ago as an adaption of the 70-year-old Karnofsky performance score. It is short, easily understood and part of the global language of oncology. The wide prevalence of the ECOG PS attests to its proven utility and worth to help triage patient treatment. The ECOG PS is problematic. It is a unidimensional functional score. It is mostly physician assessed, subjective and therefore open to bias. It fails to account for multimorbidity, frailty or cognition. Too often the PS is recorded only once in wilful ignorance of a patient's changing physical state. As modern oncology offers an ever-widening array of therapies that are 'personalised' to tumour genotype, modern oncologists must strive to better define patient phenotype. Using a wider range of scoring and assessment tools, oncologists can identify deficits that may be reversed or steps taken to mitigate detrimental effects of treatment. These tools can function well to identify those patients who would benefit from comprehensive assessment. This overview identifies the strengths of ECOG PS but highlights the weaknesses and where these are supported by other measures. A strong recommendation is made here to move to routine use of the Clinical Frailty Score to start to triage patients and most appropriately design treatments and rehabilitation interventions.","Simcock, R; Wright, J",Clin Oncol (R Coll Radiol),,192

In this study, we evaluated proliferation and osteogenic potential of mouse osteoblasts using the MTT assay and Alizarin red staining. The levels of alkaline phosphatase, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase, and adiponectin in culture supernatants were measured using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Osteoclast bone resorbing activity was evaluated by toluidine staining and the number and area of bone resorption pits were determined. We observed increased osteogenesis in osteoblasts co-cultured with the BM-derived myeloid cells compared to the osteoblasts cultured alone. Mice with global Lrp5 deletion had a relatively higher bone density compared to the mice carrying osteoblast/osteocyte-specific Lrp5 deletion. An increased frequency of M2 macrophages and reduced expression of inflammatory cytokines were detected in the myeloid cells derived from the bone marrow of mice with global Lrp5 deletion. Higher adipogenic potential and elevated levels of adiponectin in the global Lrp5 deletion mice contributed to the preferential M2 macrophage polarization. Here, we identified a novel systemic regulatory mechanism of bone formation and degradation in mice with global Lrp5 deletion. This mechanism depends on a crosstalk between the adipocytes and M2 macrophages in the bone marrow and is responsible for partly rescuing osteopenia developed as a result of decreased Wnt signaling.","Li, Lisha; Qiu, Xuemin; Zhang, Na; Sun, Yan; Wang, Yan; Wang, Ling",Exp Biol Med (Maywood),,192

AIM: To determine whether adding oseltamivir to usual care reduces time to recovery in symptomatic patients who have tested positive for coronavirus (not including SARS-CoV-2). DESIGN AND SETTING: Exploratory analysis of data from an open-label, pragmatic, randomised controlled trial during three influenza seasons, from 2016 to 2018, in primary care research networks, in 15 European countries. METHOD: Patients aged &#8805;1 year presenting to primary care with influenza-like illness (ILI), and who tested positive for coronavirus (not including SARS-CoV-2), were randomised to usual care or usual care plus oseltamivir. The primary outcome was time to recovery defined as a return to usual activities, with minor or absent fever, headache, and muscle ache. RESULTS: Coronaviruses (CoV-229E, CoV-OC43, CoV-KU1 and CoV-NL63) were identified in 308 (9%) out of 3266 randomised participants in the trial; 153 of these were allocated to usual care and 155 to usual care plus oseltamivir; the primary outcome was ascertained in 136 and 147 participants, respectively. The median time to recovery was shorter in patients randomised to oseltamivir: 4 days (interquartile range [IQR] 3-6) versus 5 days (IQR 3-8; hazard ratio 1.31; 95% confidence interval = 1.03 to 1.66; P = 0.026). CONCLUSION: Primary care patients with ILI testing positive for coronavirus (not including SARS-CoV-2) recovered sooner when oseltamivir was added to usual care compared with usual care alone.

Self-developed questionnaires were used to measure changes in nocturnal sleep, daytime napping, lifestyles and negative emotions in individuals before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Nine hundred and thirty effective questionnaires were collected in this study. Repeated measures analysis of variance and hierarchical regression analysis were applied. We found that individuals' sleep rhythms were delayed, and sleep duration and sleep latency were increased during the stay-at-home orders. Meanwhile, their exercise levels and learning/working efficiency were decreased, and electronic device use time, annoyance levels and anxiety levels were increased. Delayed sleep patterns affected lifestyles and emotions. Moreover, sleep quality positively predicted learning/working efficiency and exercise levels, and negatively predicted use of electronic devices and negative emotions. Sleep patterns became delayed on weekdays during stay-at-home orders in all four daytime napping groups (no daytime napping, daytime napping as before, more daytime napping and less daytime napping), and the group taking daytime naps as before had a minimal variation, and their lifestyles and emotions were significantly better than those of the other groups. This study demonstrated that under the influence of stress caused by the pandemic, maintaining regular daytime napping was an effective way to stabilize sleep patterns and biological rhythms, keep good lifestyles and alleviate the effect of acute psychological stress, and to prevent and control mental disorders during the pandemic.","Dai, Wenjuan; Zhou, Jieying; Li, Guangming; Zhang, Bin; Ma, Ning",J Sleep Res,,192

Analysis of the antibody response in mild versus moderate/severe patients, using our new developed quantitative electrochemiluminescent assay for detecting IgM/IgA/IgG antibodies toward SARS-CoV-2 antigens, revealed a rapid onset of IgG/IgA antibodies, specifically in moderate/severe patients. IgM antibodies against the viral receptor binding domain, but not against nucleocapsid protein, were detected at early stages of the disease. Furthermore, we observed a marked reduction in IgM/IgA antibodies over-time. Adapting our assay for ACE2 binding-competition, demonstrated that the presence of potentially neutralizing antibodies is corelated with IgG/IgA. Finally, analysis of the cytokine profile in COVID-19 patients revealed unique correlation of an IL-12p70/IL33 and IgG seroconversion, which correlated with disease severity.

252046,Reclaiming your office practice,2020,"Sickle cell disease is prevalent in several parts of the world. Most hospitalizations of these patients are related to pain crisis episodes. Moreover, levels of hemoglobin are lower in sickle cell disease patients as compared with the general population. Complications related to sickle cell disease are managed with blood transfusions, hydroxyurea, and opioids. Despite these therapies, patients with sickle cell disease experience multiple pain crisis episodes leading to hospitalizations and end-organ damage. The US Food and Drug Administration has approved three new drugs-L-glutamine, voxelotor, and crizanlizumab-for the prophylaxis and treatment of complications related to sickle cell disease. This review was aimed at assessing the efficacy and safety of recently approved drugs for the treatment of sickle cell disease. A comprehensive search was made on PubMed and clinicaltrials.gov to look for clinical trials reporting the efficacy and safety of recently approved drugs for sickle cell disease. Based on the results of clinical trials, L-glutamine, voxelotor, and crizanlizumab were well tolerated by sickle cell disease patients. L-Glutamine and crizanlizumab reduced the number of sickle cell crisis episodes, while voxelotor improved the level of hemoglobin in sickle cell disease patients.

Methods: A representative US sample (N = 362) completed an online survey about potential risk/protective factors and health behaviors prior to the pandemic and after implemented/recommended restrictions. We assessed change in perceived health behaviors prior to and following introduction of COVID-19. We conducted hierarchical linear regression to explore and identify risk/protective factors related to physical activity, diet quality, and social isolation. Results: There have been substantial decreases in physical activity and increases in sedentary behavior and social isolation, but no changes in diet quality since COVID-19. We identified modifiable and non-modifiable factors associated with each health behavior. Conclusions: Negative effects indicate the need for universal intervention to promote health behaviors. Inequalities in health behaviors among vulnerable populations may be exacerbated since COVID-19, suggesting need for targeted invention. Social support may be a mechanism to promote health behaviors. We suggest scaling out effective health behavior interventions with the same intensity in which physical distancing recommendations were implemented.","Weaver, Raven H; Jackson, Alexandra; Lanigan, Jane; Power, Thomas G; Anderson, Alana; Cox, Anne E; Eddy, Linda; Parker, Louise; Sano, Yoshie; Weybright, Elizabeth",Am J Health Behav,,192

254461,Novel Corona Virus: One Biological Disaster of 2020,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic that emerged in Wuhan China has generated substantial morbidity and mortality impact around the world during the last four months. The daily trend in reported cases has been rapidly rising in Latin America since March 2020 with the great majority of the cases reported in Brazil followed by Peru as of April 15th, 2020. Although Peru implemented a range of social distancing measures soon after the confirmation of its first case on March 6th, 2020, the daily number of new COVID-19 cases continues to accumulate in this country. We assessed the early COVID-19 transmission dynamics and the effect of social distancing interventions in Lima, Peru. We estimated the reproduction number, R, during the early transmission phase in Lima from the daily series of imported and autochthonous cases by the date of symptoms onset as of March 30th, 2020. We also assessed the effect of social distancing interventions in Lima by generating short-term forecasts grounded on the early transmission dynamics before interventions were put in place. Prior to the implementation of the social distancing measures in Lima, the local incidence curve by the date of symptoms onset displays near exponential growth dynamics with the mean scaling of growth parameter, p, estimated at 0.9 (95%CI: 0.9,1.0) and the reproduction number at 2.3 (95% CI: 2.0, 2.5). Our analysis indicates that school closures and other social distancing interventions have helped slow down the spread of the novel coronavirus, with the nearly exponential growth trend shifting to an approximately linear growth trend soon after the broad scale social distancing interventions were put in place by the government. While the interventions appear to have slowed the transmission rate in Lima, the number of new COVID-19 cases continue to accumulate, highlighting the need to strengthen social distancing and active case finding efforts to mitigate disease transmission in the region.","Munayco, César V; Tariq, Amna; Rothenberg, Richard; Soto-Cabezas, Gabriela G; Reyes, Mary F; Valle, Andree; Rojas-Mezarina, Leonardo; Cabezas, César; Loayza, Manuel; Chowell, Gerardo",,,192

The identification of occupational groups most at risk of exposure is critical in contrasting and preventing the epidemic diffusion. OBJECTIVE: To analyse the compensation claim applications collected by the Italian Workers' Compensation Authority (INAIL) for identifying the occupational patterns and the temporal trend, in comparison with general population data. METHODS: Daily time series of compensation claim applications for COVID-19 injuries in the period March-October 2020, has been analysed, estimating the epidemiological parameters of interest and comparing findings with general population data. RESULTS: In the period March-October 2020, 65,804 compensation claim applications for COVID-19 have been collected by INAIL. The ratio between compensation claims applications and COVID-19 cases in the general population appears decreasing in the period, passing from 20% in the first pandemic period (March-April) to 3-4% in the September-October period. During the summer period, an increase in male and not Italian component and a decrease in mean age, Northern regions, and health care workers contributions to the occupational claims applications have been observed. DISCUSSION: The comparative analyses between occupational and general population data allowed to describe how the so called ""second wave"" of COVID-19 epidemic in Italy involved the occupational settings less than the other risk factors. There is a need to go towards an -occupational surveillance system for COVID-19 infection, with the aim of monitoring and preventing the occupational risk of infection, supporting insurance system effectiveness and managing vaccination policies.","Marinaccio, Alessandro; Brusco, Adelina; Bucciarelli, Andrea; D039,; Amario, Silvia; Iavicoli, Sergio",Med Lav,,192

Accepted manuscripts have been peer-reviewed and copyedited, but are posted online before technical formatting and author proofing. These manuscripts are not the final version of record and will be replaced with the final article (formatted per AJHP style and proofed by the authors) at a later time. PURPOSE: This article aims to evaluate management options for antipsychotic-induced hyperprolactinemia and associated treatment considerations such as efficacy, tolerability, drug interactions, contraindications, and dosing regimens. SUMMARY: Hyperprolactinemia is a common adverse effect of antipsychotics. First-line management includes reducing the dose of the offending antipsychotic, discontinuing the antipsychotic, or switching to another antipsychotic associated with a lower risk of hyperprolactinemia. However, these options are not always practical and are associated with a risk of relapse of the psychiatric illness. Other management options include adjunctive aripiprazole, dopamine agonists (cabergoline and bromocriptine), metformin, and herbal supplements. A search of Embase, PubMed, and Google Scholar using key terms such as hyperprolactinemia, prolactin, antipsychotic, treatment guidelines, aripiprazole, dopamine agonist, cabergoline, bromocriptine, metformin, herbals, supplements, and medications was conducted for literature retrieval. Upon evaluation of the available literature we found the following: (1) aripiprazole is safe and effective in lowering prolactin levels within normal limits; (2) adjunctive cabergoline and bromocriptine decrease elevated prolactin levels, while cabergoline may be more effective in reducing prolactin but can also be associated with a more serious adverse effect of cardiac valvular abnormalities; (3) metformin causes a mild reduction of prolactin levels; and (4) there are limited data to support use of herbal medications (chamomile, Peony-Glycyrrhiza decoction, and shakuyaku-kanzo-to) in antipsychotic-induced hyperprolactinemia. CONCLUSION: There are treatments available for antipsychotic-induced hyperprolactinemia in patients who are unable to alter their current antipsychotic regimen. However, there remains a need for additional short- and long-term studies to determine the efficacy and safety of these treatment strategies, given that patients taking antipsychotics typically require chronic, life-long treatment for their illnesses.","Rusgis, Matthew M; Alabbasi, Afaq Y; Nelson, Leigh Anne",Am. j. health system pharm,,192

A retrospective study of children less than 15 years old with primary or secondary immunosuppression infected with SARS-CoV-2 during March 2020 was performed. In this series, 8 immunocompromised patients with COVID-19 disease are reported, accounting for 15% of the positive cases detected in children in a reference hospital. The severity of the symptoms was mild-moderate in the majority with a predominance of febrile syndrome, with mild radiological involvement and in some cases with mild respiratory distress that required oxygen therapy. The rational and prudent management of these patients is discussed, evaluating possible treatments and options for hospitalization or outpatient follow-up.Conclusion: In our experience, monitoring of children with immunosuppression and COVID-19 disease can be performed as outpatients if close monitoring is possible. Hospitalization should be assessed when high fever, radiological involvement, and/or respiratory distress are present. What is Known: â¢ SARS-CoV-2 infection is usually mild in children. What is New: â¢ Outcome of immunosuppressed children with COVID-19 is generally good, with a mild-moderate course.","Pérez-Martinez, Antonio; Guerra-García, Pilar; Melgosa, Marta; Frauca, Esteban; Fernandez-Camblor, Carlota; Remesal, Agustin; Calvo, Cristina",Eur. j. pediatr,,192
259647,A Framework for Human-Robot-Human Physical Interaction Based on N-Player Game Theory,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Hospital do Rim is a high-volume kidney transplant (KT) center located in São Paulo, a city with 12.2 million inhabitants. Over the last 18 years, we performed 11 436 KT, 70% of which from deceased donors. To mitigate the effects of reduction in the number of transplants on the waiting list, sequential measures were implemented when COVID-19 was declared pandemic. METHODS: The first step was to provide SARS-COV-2 RT-PCR testing for all symptomatic employees and patients and the compulsory use of personal protective equipment in the hospital facilities. Living donor KT were postponed, and all deceased donors and recipients were tested before the transplantation. The immunosuppressive protocols were maintained, and telehealth strategies were developed. RESULTS: Among the 1013 employees, there were 214 cases of COVID-19, nine required ward hospitalization, and no deaths occurred. In 26%, the probable source of contamination was occupational. From the first patient diagnosed with COVID-19 in 03/20/2020 till 10/21/2020, 523 deceased KT were performed, a 21% increase compared with 2019, with no confirmed donor-derived SARS-CoV-2 infection. Four patients were transplanted with a positive pretransplant SARS-CoV-2 test, but none of them developed the disease. Overall, of 11 875 KT followed in our center, 674 developed COVID-19. Among the hospitalized, 53% required mechanical ventilation, and 45% required hemodialysis. Their overall mortality rate was 27.5%. CONCLUSION: This experience shows the challenges that transplant centers faced as the pandemic unfolded and illustrates the effectiveness of the sequential measures implemented to provide a safe environment for transplantation.","Cristelli, Marina P; Viana, Laila A; Fernandes, Ruan de A; Nakamura, Monica R; Foresto, Renato D; Stopa Martins, Suelen B; Alvarazi, Jacqueline F L; Leite, Valeria C; de Oliveira, Francisco R; Carneiro, Vanessa A; Santos, Daniel Wagner de C L; Aguiar, Wilson F; Vaz, Maria Lucia Dos S; Tedesco-Silva, Helio; Medina-Pestana, José",Transpl Infect Dis,,192

What have we learned?,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has disproportionately affected communities of color, with blacks experiencing the highest rates of disease severity and mortality. A vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 has the potential to reduce the race mortality gap from COVID-19; however, hesitancy of the vaccine in the black community threatens vaccine uptake. METHODS: We conducted focus groups with black barbershop and salon owners living in zip codes of elevated COVID-19 prevalence to assess their attitudes, beliefs, and norms around a COVID-19 vaccine. We used a modified grounded theory approach to analyze the transcripts. RESULTS: We completed four focus groups (n=24 participants) in July and August 2020. Participants were an average age of 46, 89% were black non-Hispanic. Hesitancy against the COVID-19 vaccine was high due to mistrust in the medical establishment, concerns with the accelerated timeline for vaccine development, limited data on short and long-term side effects, and the political environment promoting racial injustice. Some participants were willing to consider the vaccine once the safety profile is robust and reassuring. Receiving a recommendation to take the vaccine from a trusted health care provider served as a facilitator. Health beliefs identified were similar to concerns around other vaccines, and included the fear of getting the infection with vaccination, and preferring to improve one's baseline physical health through alternative therapies. CONCLUSION: We found that hesitancy of the COVID-19 vaccine was high; however, provider recommendation and transparency around the safety profile might help reduce hesitancy of the COVID-19 vaccine.","Momplaisir, Florence; Haynes, Norrisa; Nkwihoreze, Hervette; Nelson, Maria; Werner, Rachel M; Jemmott, John",Clin. infect. dis,,192
262032,Repurposing existing vaccines,2020,"Divya-Swasari-Vati (DSV) is a calcium-containing herbal medicine formulated for the symptomatic control of respiratory illnesses observed in the current COVID-19 pandemic. DSV is an Ayurvedic medicine used for the treatment of chronic cough and inflammation. The formulation has shown its pharmacological effects against SARS-CoV-2 induced inflammation in the humanized zebrafish model. The present inventive research aimed to establish comprehensive quality parameters of the DSV formulation using validated chromatographic analytical tools. Exhaustive identification of signature marker compounds present in the plant ingredients was carried out using ultra performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC/QToF MS). This was followed by simultaneous estimation of selected marker components using rapid and reliable high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis. Eleven marker components, namely gallic acid, protocatechuic acid, methyl gallate, ellagic acid, coumarin, cinnamic acid, glycyrrhizin, eugenol, 6-gingerol, piperine and glabridin, were selected out of seventy-four identified makers for the quantitative analysis in DSV formulation. Validation of the HPLC method was evaluated by its linearity, precision, and accuracy tests as per the International Council of Harmonization (ICH) guidelines. Calibration curves for the eleven marker compounds showed good linear regression (r2 > 0.999). The relative standard deviation (RSD) value of intraday and interday precision tests were within the prescribed limits. The accuracy test results ranged from 92.75% to 100.13%. Thus, the present inclusive approach is first of its kind employing multi-chromatographic platforms for identification and quantification of the marker components in DSV, which could be applied for routine standardization of DSV and other related formulations.","Balkrishna, Acharya; Verma, Sudeep; Sharma, Priyanka; Tomer, Meenu; Srivastava, Jyotish; Varshney, Anurag",,,192

Methods: A quantitative descriptive cross-section survey study of 388 patients. It has been done in the cardiac outpatient department and conducted virtually through telemedicine. Results: Despite this pandemic and its consensuses, the majority of cardiac outpatients will still seek medical advice in case of experiencing symptoms. Nevertheless, the fear of contracting COVID-19 infection, which can alter patient’s decisions from visiting the emergency room and the increase in stress level during these challenging times, is genuine and no more an element of guessing. Conclusion: The majority of cardiac outpatients will wisely seek medical advice in case of serious cardiac symptoms and are adherent to their medications during this pandemic. Nevertheless, they face many concerns which need to implement a preventive and helping measures to fight the consensuses of COVID-19 such as, patient educations, establishing a hotline to all patients, telemedicine, new phone applications, and delivering medications to patients are essential in such circumstances to ensure continuity of care.","Samargandy, Sondos A.; Al Garni, Turki A.; Almoghairi, Abdulrahman; Alahmari, Mohammad; Alshehri, Bandar; Mosaad, Mohammad; Nour Ahmed, Jamal M.; Amri, Hussein A.; Samargandy, Shaza",J.

We aimed to assess the safety and potential efficacy of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) selective inhibitors in high-risk patients. Methods: Retrospective study of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and aged ≥ 50 years who were admitted to hospital. Adverse outcomes analysed included supplemental oxygen use, intensive care unit admission, mechanical ventilation and mortality, with the primary endpoint a composite of any of these. Plasma levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines were measured in a subset. Results: Twenty-two of 168 (13.1%) in the cohort received COX-2 inhibitors [median duration 3 days, interquartile range (IQR) 3–4.25]. Median age was 61 (IQR 55–67.75), 44.6% were female, and 72.6% had at least one comorbidity. A lower proportion of patients receiving COX-2 inhibitors met the primary endpoint: 4 (18.2%) versus 57 (39.0%), P = 0.062. This difference was less pronounced after adjusting for baseline difference in age, gender and comorbidities in a multivariate logistic regression model [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 0.45, 95% CI 0.14–1.46]. The level of interleukin-6 declined after treatment in five of six (83.3%) treatment group patients [compared to 15 of 28 (53.6%) in the control group] with a greater reduction in absolute IL-6 levels (P-value = 0.025). Conclusion: Treatment with COX-2 inhibitors was not associated with an increase in adverse outcomes. Its potential for therapeutic use as an immune modulator warrants further evaluation in a large randomised controlled trial.","Ong, Sean Wei Xiang; Tan, Wilnard Yeong Tze; Chan, Yi-Hao; Fong, Siew-Wai; Renia, Laurent; Ng, Lisa FP; Leo, Yee-Sin; Lye, David Chien; Young, Barnaby Edward",Clin.

METHODS: We performed a recollection of all the clinical and laboratory data of patients having acute neurological symptoms temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection at a third-level referral hospital in Mexico City (Instituto Nacional de Pediatría). Patients in an age group of 0-17 years with acute neurological signs (including ascending weakness with areflexia, diminished visual acuity, encephalopathy, ataxia, stroke, or weakness with plasma creatinine kinase (CK) elevation) were evaluated. RESULTS: Out of 23 patients with neurological manifestations, 10 (43%) had a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among the infected patients, 5 (50%) were males aged 2-16 years old (median age 11.8 years old). Four (40%) patients confirmed a close contact with a relative positive for SARS-CoV-2, while 6 (60%) cases had a history of SARS-CoV-2-related symptoms over the previous 2 weeks. The following diagnoses were established: 3 cases of GBS, 2 of ON, 2 of AIS, one of myositis with rhabdomyolysis, one ACA, and one of anti-NMDA-R encephalitis. CONCLUSIONS: Neurological manifestations temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection were noticed in the pediatric population even without respiratory symptoms. In this study, 2 of 6 symptomatic patients had mild respiratory symptoms and 4 had unspecific symptoms. During this pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 infection should be considered as etiology in patients with acute neurological symptoms, with or without previous respiratory manifestations, particularly in teenagers.","Sánchez-Morales, Areli Estela; Urrutia-Osorio, Marta; Camacho-Mendoza, Esteban; Rosales-Pedraza, Gustavo; Dávila-Maldonado, Luis; González-Duarte, Alejandra; Herrera-Mora, Patricia; Ruiz-García, Matilde",Childs nerv. syst,,192

273413,Highlights from this issue,2021,"Quinacrine (QC) and chloroquine (CQ) have antimicrobial and antiviral activities as well as antimalarial activity, although the mechanisms remain unknown. QC increased the antimicrobial activity against yeast exponentially with a pH-dependent increase in the cationic amphiphilic drug (CAD) structure. CAD-QC localized in the yeast membranes and induced glucose starvation by noncompetitively inhibiting glucose uptake as antipsychotic chlorpromazine (CPZ) did. An exponential increase in antimicrobial activity with pH-dependent CAD formation was also observed for CQ, indicating that the CAD structure is crucial for its pharmacological activity. A decrease in CAD structure with a slight decrease in pH from 7.4 greatly reduced their effects; namely, these drugs would inefficiently act on falciparum malaria and COVID-19 pneumonia patients with acidosis, resulting in resistance. The decrease in CAD structure at physiological pH was not observed for quinine, primaquine, or mefloquine. Therefore, restoring the normal blood pH or using pH-insensitive quinoline drugs might be effective for these infectious diseases with acidosis.","Kitagawa, Tomohisa; Matsumoto, Atsushi; Terashima, Ichiro; Uesono, Yukifumi",J Med Chem,,192

274778,Non-contact infrared assessment of human body temperature: The journal Temperature toolbox,2021,"The current outbreak of viral pneumonia in the city of Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel coronavirus designated 2019-nCoV by the World Health Organization, as determined by sequencing the viral RNA genome. Many initial patients were exposed to wildlife animals at the Huanan seafood wholesale market, where poultry, snake, bats, and other farm animals were also sold. To investigate possible virus reservoir, we have carried out comprehensive sequence analysis and comparison in conjunction with relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) bias among different animal species based on the 2019-nCoV sequence. Results obtained from our analyses suggest that the 2019-nCoV may appear to be a recombinant virus between the bat coronavirus and an origin-unknown coronavirus. The recombination may occurred within the viral spike glycoprotein, which recognizes a cell surface receptor. Additionally, our findings suggest that 2019-nCoV has most similar genetic information with bat coronovirus and most similar codon usage bias with snake. Taken together, our results suggest that homologous recombination may occur and contribute to the 2019-nCoV cross-species transmission.","Ji, Wei; Wang, Wei; Zhao, Xiaofang; Zai, Junjie; Li, Xingguang",J Med Virol,,192
276169,Group Testing under Superspreading Dynamics,2021-06-30,"Glucocorticoids are frequently prescribed in inflammatory diseases and have recently experienced a boom in the treatment of COVID-19. Small studies have shown an effect of glucocorticoids on inflammatory marker levels, but definitive proof is lacking. We investigated the influence of prednisone on inflammatory biomarkers in a previous multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial that compared a 7-day treatment course of 50-mg prednisone to placebo in patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia. We compared levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), leukocyte and neutrophil count between patients with and without glucocorticoid treatment at baseline and on days 3, 5, and 7 and at discharge by Wilcoxon tests and analysis of variance. A total of 356 patient data sets in the prednisone group and 355 in the placebo group were available for analysis. Compared to placebo, use of prednisone was associated with reductions in levels of CRP on days 3, 5, and 7 (mean difference of 46%, P < .001 for each time point). For PCT, no such difference was observed. Leukocyte and neutrophil count were higher in the prednisone group at all time points (mean difference of 27% for leukocytes and 33% for neutrophils, P <.001 for all time points). We conclude that after administration of glucocorticoids in community-acquired pneumonia, patients had lower CRP levels and increased leukocyte and neutrophil count as compared to the placebo group. PCT levels were not different between treatment groups. PCT levels thus may more appropriately mirror the resolution of infection compared to more traditional inflammatory markers.","Raess, Natalie; Schuetz, Philipp; Cesana-Nigro, Nicole; Winzeler, Bettina; Urwyler, Sandrine A; Schaedelin, Sabine; Rodondi, Nicolas; Blum, Manuel R; Briel, Matthias; Mueller, Beat; Christ-Crain, Mirjam; Blum, Claudine A",J. clin. pharmacol,,192
276565,Prediction of adverse drug reactions using drug convolutional neural networks,2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound global impact on governments, healthcare systems, economies, and populations around the world Within the East Asia and Pacific region, some countries have mitigated the spread of the novel coronavirus effectively and largely avoided severe negative consequences, while others still struggle with containment As the second wave reaches East Asia and the Pacific, it becomes more obvious that additional SARS-CoV-2 surveillance is needed to track recent shifts in the pandemic, rates of increase, and persistence OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study is to provide advanced surveillance metrics for COVID-19 transmission that account for speed, acceleration, jerk, persistence, and weekly shifts in the pandemic, to better understand country risk for explosive growth and those who are managing the pandemic successfully Existing surveillance coupled with our dynamic metrics of transmission will inform health policy to control the COVID-19 pandemic until an effective vaccine is developed We provide novel indicators to measure the transmission of disease METHODS: Using a longitudinal trend analysis study design, we extracted 330 days of COVID data from public health registries We use an empirical difference equation to measure the daily number of cases in East Asia and the Pacific as a function of the prior number of cases, the level of testing, and weekly shift variables based on a dynamic panel model that was estimated using the generalized method of moments (GMM) approach by implementing the Arellano-Bond estimator in R RESULTS: Based on standard surveillance metrics, Indonesia, Philippines, and Myanmar are concerning because they have the largest new caseloads at 4,301, 2,588, and 1,387 respectively However, when looking at the acceleration of new COVID-19 infections, we find that French Polynesia, Malaysia, and Philippines have the rates at 3 17, 22, and 06 per 100,000 These three countries also rank highest in jerk at 15 45, 10 and 04 respectively CONCLUSIONS: Two of the most populous countries in East Asia and the Pacific, Indonesia and the Philippines, have alarming surveillance metrics These two countries rank highest in new infections in the region The highest rates of speed, acceleration and positive upwards jerk belong to French Polynesia, Malaysia and the Philippines Positive rates of speed, acceleration and upwards jerk are more likely to result in explosive growth While all countries in East Asia and Pacific need to be cautious in regards to opening their countries because outbreaks are likely to occur in the second wave of COVID-19, the country of greatest concern remains the Philippines Based on standard and enhanced surveillance, the Philippines has not gained control of the COVID-19 epidemic, which is particularly troubling because the country ranks 4th in population in the region Without extreme and rigid social distancing, quarantines, hygiene, and masking to reverse trends, the Philippines will remain on the global top 5 list of worst COVID-19 outbreaks resulting in high morbidity and mortality The second wave will only exacerbate existing conditions and increase COVID-19 transmissions","Post, L.

278218,Enjoy the Fantasy of a “v” While You Can,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has been creating a panic and distressing situations among the entire population globally including Nepal. No study has been conducted assessing the psychological impact of this pandemic on the general public in Nepal. The objective of this study is to assess the mental health status during COVID-19 outbreak and explore the potential influencing factors among the population attending the hospital fever clinics with COVID-19 symptoms. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted between May-June, 2020 with a sample of 645 participants aged 18 and above in 26 hospitals across Nepal. Telephone interviews were conducted using a semi-structured questionnaire along with a validated psychometric tool, the Depression, Anxiety and Stress (DASS-21) scale. The metrics and scores of symptoms and their severity were created and analyzed. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine the association of potential covariates with outcome variables. RESULTS: The prevalence of anxiety, depression and stress were 14%, 7% and 5% respectively. In reference to Karnali, participants from Bagmati province reported higher level of anxiety (OR 3.44, 95% CI 1.31-9.06), while stress (OR 4.27, 95% CI 1.09-18.32) and depressive symptoms (OR 3.11, 95% CI 1.05-9.23) observed higher among the participants in Province 1. Women were more at risk of anxiety (OR 3.41, 95% CI 1.83-6.36) than men. Similarly, people currently living in rented houses reported more stress (OR 2.97, 95% CI 1.05-8.43) and those living far from family reported higher rates of depressive symptoms (OR 3.44, 95% CI 1.03-11.46). CONCLUSION: The study identified increased prevalence of stress, anxiety and depressive symptoms during the initial stage of COVID-19 pandemic in Nepal. Considering the findings, there is urgent need to develop and implement appropriate community-based mental health programs targeting individuals who have had COVID-19 symptoms and who are prone to develop adverse mental health outcomes.","Devkota, Hridaya Raj; Sijali, Tula Ram; Bogati, Ramji; Ahmad, Meraj; Shakya, Karuna Laxmi; Adhikary, Pratik",PLoS One,,192

Herein lies an interesting research opportunity to progress personal wellbeing and capability despite the extant issues of recent times. The paper demonstrates the design and implementation of an evolving serious game that supports lifelong learning and decision making relating to personal finance. The example is a useful account of serious games' evolutionary potential to incrementally support users through lifelong learning. The game's holistic design incorporates autonomy, motivation, and support structures to ensure that lifelong learning and decision making is effectively managed through an evolving system.

The novel coronavirus is known to affect individuals in all age groups, especially patients with multiple comorbidities. A nationwide lockdown has restricted the routine patient care, with health-care services focusing mainly on emergency services and COVID patient management. These restrictions in health services may delay the treatments of non-COVID patients. This conundrum is especially true in cancer patients as they require frequent visits to the hospital, and there is a lack of understanding of the treatment prioritization in cancer patients. In this case, we discuss the concerns faced by a 37-year-old male with neuroendocrine tumor of the anal canal who was tested COVID positive. His surgery was canceled following the report and was shifted to the COVID care facility. Best supportive care was given till further management.","Krishnapriya, V.; Rathore, Puneet; Kumar, Sanjeev; Shweta,; Thankachan, Alice; Haokip, Nengneivah; Vig, Saurabh; Bhatnagar, Sushma",Indian J.

Studies indicate that RAAS imbalance worsens the prognosis in COVID-19. We present a consecutive retrospective COVID-19 cohort with findings of frequent pulmonary thromboembolism (17%), high pulmonary artery pressure (60%) and lung MRI perfusion disturbances. We demonstrate, in swine, that infusing angiotensin II or blocking ACE2 induces increased pulmonary artery pressure, reduces blood oxygenation, increases coagulation, disturbs lung perfusion, induces diffuse alveolar damage, and acute tubular necrosis compared to control animals. We further demonstrate that this imbalanced state can be ameliorated by infusion of an angiotensin receptor blocker and low-molecular-weight heparin. In this work, we show that a pathophysiological state in swine induced by RAAS imbalance shares several features with the clinical COVID-19 presentation. Therefore, we propose that severe COVID-19 could partially be driven by a RAAS imbalance.","Rysz, Susanne; Al-Saadi, Jonathan; Sjöström, Anna; Farm, Maria; Campoccia Jalde, Francesca; Plattén, Michael; Eriksson, Helen; Klein, Margareta; Vargas-Paris, Roberto; Nyrén, Sven; Abdula, Goran; Ouellette, Russell; Granberg, Tobias; Jonsson Fagerlund, Malin; Lundberg, Johan",Nat Commun,,192

We present a case of ventilation management for a COVID-19 patient where electrical impedance tomography (EIT) was used to personalize care. CASE PRESENTATION: The patient developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, required invasive mechanical ventilation, and was subsequently weaned. EIT was used multiple times: to titrate the positive end-expiratory pressure, understand the influence of body position, and guide the support levels during weaning and after extubation. We show how EIT provides bedside monitoring of the patient´s response to various therapeutic interventions and helps guide treatments. CONCLUSION: EIT provides unique information that may help the ventilation management in the pandemic of COVID-19.","Zhao, Zhanqi; Zhang, Jin-Shou; Chen, Ying-Tzu; Chang, Hou-Tai; Hsu, Yeong-Long; Frerichs, Inéz; Adler, Andy",BMC Pulm Med,,192
280657,Highlights from this issue,2021,"The healthcare environment serves as one of the possible routes of transmission of epidemiologically important pathogens, but the role of the contaminated environment on SARS-CoV-2 transmission remains unclear. We reviewed survival, contamination, and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via environmental surfaces and shared medical devices as well as environmental disinfection of COVID-19 in healthcare settings. Coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, have been demonstrated to survive for hours to days on environmental surfaces depending on experimental conditions. The healthcare environment is frequently contaminated with SARS-CoV-2 RNA in most studies but without evidence of viable virus. Although direct exposure to respiratory droplets is the main transmission route of SARS-CoV-2, the contaminated healthcare environment can potentially result in transmission of SARS-CoV-2 as described with other coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. It is important to improve thoroughness of cleaning/disinfection practice in healthcare facilities and select effective disinfectants to decontaminate inanimate surfaces and shared patient care items.","Kanamori, Hajime; Weber, David J; Rutala, William A",Clin Infect Dis,,192
280723,Long COVID: an estrogen-associated autoimmune disease?,2021,"BACKGROUND: There is ongoing controversy whether antidepressant use alters suicide risk in adults with depression and other treatment indications. METHODS: Systematic review of observational studies, searching MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Web of Science, PsycARTICLES and SCOPUS for case-control and cohort studies. We included studies on depression and various indications unspecified (including off-label use) reporting risk of suicide and/or suicide attempt for adult patients using selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) and other new-generation antidepressants relative to non-users. Effects were meta-analytically aggregated with random-effects models, reporting relative risk (RR) estimates with 95% CIs. Publication bias was assessed via funnel-plot asymmetry and trim-and-fill method. Financial conflict of interest (fCOI) was defined present when lead authors' professorship was industry-sponsored, they received industry-payments, or when the study was industry-sponsored. RESULTS: We included 27 studies, 19 on depression and 8 on various indications unspecified (n=1.45 million subjects). SSRI were not definitely related to suicide risk (suicide and suicide attempt combined) in depression (RR=1.03, 0.70-1.51) and all indications (RR=1.19, 0.88-1.60). Any new-generation antidepressant was associated with higher suicide risk in depression (RR=1.29, 1.06-1.57) and all indications (RR=1.45, 1.23-1.70). Studies with fCOI reported significantly lower risk estimates than studies without fCOI. Funnel-plots were asymmetrical and imputation of missing studies with trim-and-fill method produced considerably higher risk estimates. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to new-generation antidepressants is associated with higher suicide risk in adult routine-care patients with depression and other treatment indications. Publication bias and fCOI likely contribute to systematic underestimation of risk in the published literature.

Despite the numerous examples where payers and providers have attempted to independently address SDoH, there is limited evidence for the success of these interventions. Since most stakeholders individually do not have access to financial and clinical data, identifying an ROI for SDoH interventions is logistically challenging, but even when these data are available, stakeholders may not want to share their learnings due to negative findings and/or unwillingness to share proprietary information. These issues are further amplified by the effects of COVID-19 and its worsening effect on widening health disparities, but many payers and providers have risen to the challenge together. This article advocates for the importance of payer-provider partnerships to address SDoH and uses examples of integrated delivery and finance systems as case studies of how these partnerships could function.

Methods: This retrospective cohort study included confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia in a public hospital in South Korea. The worsening oxygenation group was defined as those with SpO2 &#8804; 94%, or received oxygen or mechanical ventilation (MV) throughout the clinical course versus the non-worsening group who were without any respiratory event. Parameters were compared, and the extent of viral pneumonia from an initial chest CT were calculated using artificial intelligence (AI) and measured visually by a radiologist. Results: We included 136 patients with 32 (23.5%) in the worsening oxygenation group, of whom two needed MV and one died.

290450,Including monopoles to a fully desingularized boundary element method for acoustics,2021-04-27,"Destructive impacts of COVID-19 pandemic worldwide necessitates taking more appropriate measures for mitigating virus spread and development of the effective theranostic agents. In general, high heterogeneity of viruses is a major challenging issue towards the development of effective antiviral agents. Regarding the coronavirus, its high mutation rates can negatively affect virus detection process or the efficiency of drugs and vaccines in development or induce drug resistance. Bioengineered nanomaterials with suitable physicochemical characteristics for site-specific therapeutic delivery, highly-sensitive nanobiosensors for detection of very low virus concentration, and real-time protections using the nanorobots can provide roadmaps towards the imminent breakthroughs in theranostics of a variety of diseases including the COVID-19. Besides revolutionizing the classical disinfection procedures, state-of-the-art nanotechnology-based approaches enable providing the analytical tools for accelerated monitoring of coronavirus and associated biomarkers or drug delivery towards the pulmonary system or other affected organs. Multivalent nanomaterials capable of interaction with multivalent pathogens including the viruses could be suitable candidates for viral detection and prevention of further infections. Besides the inactivation or destruction of the virus, functionalized nanoparticles capable of modulating patient's immune response might be of great significance for attenuating the exaggerated inflammatory reactions or development of the effective nanovaccines and medications against the virus pandemics including the COVID-19.","Hassanzadeh, Parichehr",J Control Release,,192

291524,Vaccine time-temperature indicators for present and future viral threats,2020,"As of mid-2020, eradicating COVID-19 seems not to be an option, at least in the short term. The challenge for policy makers consists of implementing a suitable approach to contain the outbreak and limit extra deaths without exhausting healthcare forces while mitigating the impact on the country's economy and on individuals' well-being. To better describe the trade-off between the economic, societal and public health dimensions, we developed an integrated bioeconomic optimization approach. We built a discrete age-structured model considering three main populations (youth, adults and seniors) and 8 socio-professional characteristics for the adults. Fifteen lockdown exit strategies were simulated for several options: abrupt or progressive (4 or 8 weeks) lockdown lift followed by total definitive transitory final unlocking. Three values of transmission rate (Tr) were considered to represent individuals' barrier gesture compliance. Optimization under constraint to find the best combination of scenarios and options was performed on the minimal total cost for production losses due to contracted activities and hospitalization in the short and mid-term, with 3 criteria: mortality, person-days locked and hospital saturation. The results clearly show little difference between the scenarios based on the economic impact or the 3 criteria. This means that policy makers should focus on individuals' behaviors (represented by the Tr value) more than on trying to optimize the lockdown strategy (defining who is unlocked and who is locked). For a given Tr, the choices of scenarios permit the management of the hospital saturation level with regard to both its intensity and its duration, which remains a key point for public health. The results highlight the need for behavioral or experimental economics to address COVID-19 issues through a better understanding of individual behavior motivations and the identification of ways to improve biosecurity compliance.","Ferchiou, Ahmed; Bornet, Remy; Lhermie, Guillaume; Raboisson, Didier",Front Public Health,,192

We aim to improve uncertainty estimations using unlabelled data through the MixMatch semi-supervised framework. We test popular uncertainty estimation approaches, comprising Softmax scores, Monte-Carlo dropout and deterministic uncertainty quantification. To compare the reliability of the uncertainty estimates, we propose the usage of the Jensen-Shannon distance between the uncertainty distributions of correct and incorrect estimations. This metric is statistically relevant, unlike most previously used metrics, which often ignore the distribution of the uncertainty estimations. Our test results show a significant improvement in uncertainty estimates when using unlabelled data. The best results are obtained with the use of the Monte Carlo dropout method.

297785,Environmentally responsive QTL controlling surface wax load in switchgrass,2020,"Coronaviruses (CoVs) are positive-strand RNA viruses with the largest genome among all RNA viruses. They are able to infect many host, such as mammals or birds. Whereas CoVs were identified 1930s, they became known again in 2003 as the agents of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The spike protein is thought to be essential in the process of CoVs entry, because it is associated with the binding to the receptor on the host cell. It is also involved in cell tropism and pathogenesis. Receptor recognition is the crucial step in the infection. CoVs are able to bind a variety of receptors, although the selection of receptor remains unclear. Coronaviruses were initially believed to enter cells by fusion with the plasma membrane. Further studies demonstrated that many of them involve endocytosis through clathrin-dependent, caveolae-dependent, clathrin-independent, as well as caveolae-independent mechanisms. The aim of this review is to summarise current knowledge about coronaviruses, focussing especially on CoVs entry into the host cell. Advances in understanding coronaviruses replication strategy and the functioning of the replicative structures are also highlighted. The development of host-directed antiviral therapy seems to be a promising way to treat infections with SARS-CoV or other pathogenic coronaviruses. There is still much to be discovered in the inventory of pro- and anti-viral host factors relevant for CoVs replication. The latest pandemic danger, originating from China, has given our previously prepared work even more of topicality.","Wedrowska, Ewelina; Wandtke, Tomasz; Senderek, Tomasz; Piskorska, Elzbieta; Kopinski, Piotr",Ann Agric Environ Med,,192

The disease is now a global pandemic and is caused by a virus named SARS-CoV-2 by international bodies. Important viral transmission sources include human contact, respiratory droplets and aerosols, and through contact with contaminated objects. However, viral shedding in feces and urine by COVID-19-afflicted patients raises concerns about SARS-CoV-2 entering aquatic systems. Recently, targeted SARS-CoV-2 genome fragments have been successfully detected in wastewater, sewage sludge and river waters around the world. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) studies can provide early detection and assessment of COVID-19 transmission and the growth of active cases within given wastewater catchment areas. WBE surveillance's ability to detect the growth of cases was demonstrated. Was this science applied throughout the world as this pandemic spread throughout the globe? Wastewater treatment efficacy for SARS-CoV-2 removal and risk assessments associated with treated water are reported. Disinfection strategies using chemical disinfectants, heat and radiation for deactivating and destroying SARS-CoV-2 are explained. Analytical methods of SARS-CoV-2 detection are covered. This review provides a more complete overview of the present status of SARS-CoV-2 and its consequences in aquatic systems. So far, WBE programs have not yet served to provide the early alerts to authorities that they have the potential to achieve.

RECENT FINDINGS: Recommendations and policies from government and national health organizations, combined with social distancing, have led to exponential increases in telemedicine use. Teleophthalmology can be integrated into ophthalmic care delivery. In the emergency room, teleophthalmology can be utilized to triage patients and diagnose common ophthalmic eye diseases. Ophthalmology practices can utilize real-time medicine to conduct many parts of an in-person exam. In cases where more complex diagnostic tools are warranted, a model incorporating telemedicine and focused in-person visits may still be beneficial. Innovative technologies emerging in the market allow for increased remote monitoring, screening, and management of adult and pediatric patients for common eye diseases. SUMMARY: COVID-19 created a demand for healthcare delivery that limits in-person examination and potential viral exposure. Teleophthalmology allows ophthalmologists to continue caring for patients while keeping physicians and patients safe. Although challenges still exist, the pandemic has accelerated the adoption of teleophthalmology. As a result, teleophthalmology will play an integral role in providing high-quality efficient care in the near future.","Kalavar, Meghana; Hua, Hong-Uyen; Sridhar, Jayanth",Curr Opin Ophthalmol,,192

For example, some individual genes or op-erons can be affected by specific horizontal gene transfer and recombination events. Thus, the evolutionary history of each gene should be represented by its own phylogenetic tree which may display different evolutionary patterns from the species tree that accounts for the main patterns of vertical descent. The output of traditional consensus tree or supertree inference methods is a unique consensus tree or supertree. Here, we describe a new efficient method for inferring multiple alternative consensus trees and supertrees to best represent the most important evolutionary patterns of a given set of phylogenetic trees (i.e. additive trees or X-trees). We show how a specific version of the popular k-means clustering algo-rithm, based on some interesting properties of the Robinson and Foulds topologi-cal distance, can be used to partition a given set of trees into one (when the data are homogeneous) or multiple (when the data are heterogeneous) cluster(s) of trees. We adapt the popular Cali\'nski-Harabasz, Silhouette, Ball and Hall, and Gap cluster validity indices to tree clustering with k-means. A special attention is paid to the relevant but very challenging problem of inferring alternative supertrees, built from phylogenies constructed for different, but mutually overlapping, sets of taxa. The use of the Euclidean approximation in the objective function of the method makes it faster than the existing tree clustering techniques, and thus per-fectly suitable for the analysis of large genomic datasets. In this study, we apply it to discover alternative supertrees characterizing the main patterns of evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and the related betacoronaviruses","Tahiri, Nadia; Fichet, Bernard; Makarenkov, Vladimir",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.13343v2.pdf,192

301446,Reply,2021,"Background: Following its initial description in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, coronavirus-2 (COVID-19) has rapidly progressed into a worldwide pandemic, affecting millions of lives. Although every specialty of medicine has been affected, the field of allergy/immunology holds a special place in the battle against this modern-day plague. Because of the specialized training in allergy and clinical immunology, and the familiarity with comorbid contributing conditions, the allergist/immunologist is uniquely poised to play a major role both in the delivery of specialized therapeutic procedures and practices that can improve the health of patients with COVID-19 as well as in the use of forthcoming vaccines for the prevention of its spread. Objective: The purpose of this report is to examine the current body of evidence supporting the two phases of infection and inflammation that influence the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and to provide a classification of COVID-19 disease presentations and potential therapeutic targets with which the allergist/immunologist has particular expertise. Methods: This article was based on a literature review of articles published in PubMed related to COVID-19 and the immune response, and the author's own research and clinical experiences in the field of immunology. Results: Currently, the management of COVID-19 disease is being directed by a preventive strategy based on social distancing, quarantine, and facemasks to reduce the spread of the virus. Numerous clinical trials are being initiated to identify effective treatments for COVID-19 and are directed toward treatment of the two phases of infection and inflammation that influence the pathogenesis of COVID-19. An important resource for the allergist/immunologist is the COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel (COVID-19 TGP), a National Institutes of Health sponsored panel of U.S. physicians, statisticians, and other experts, which has developed a set of continuously updated treatment guidelines intended for clinicians caring for patients during the rapidly evolving COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusion: COVID-19 is unique among other infectious diseases because, in many cases, the host immune inflammatory response can cause greater harm to the individual who is infected than the pathogen itself. In this report, the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and the influence it has on COVID-19 presentations is reviewed, together with recommended potential therapeutic targets and treatment recommendations.","Bellanti, Joseph A",Allergy Asthma Proc,,192
301580,Modelling the Effects of a Health Shock on the Armenian Economy,2020,"3-trifluoromethyl-4-nitrophenol (TFM) has been used for over 60 years to control the invasive parasitic sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) in the Great Lakes basin. In the early 1990s, researchers reported that TFM induced vitellogenin in fish and that TFM was an agonist for the rainbow trout estrogen receptor. To support continued registration of TFM for sea lamprey control, regulatory agencies required further testing to evaluate potential endocrine disruption effects. Fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) were exposed to TFM at measured concentrations of 0.0659, 0.181, 0.594, 1.79, and 5.11 mg active ingredient (a.i.)/L for 21 days. No-observable- and lowest-observable-effect concentrations (NOEC and LOEC, respectively) were determined to be 1.79 mg/L or greater for each endpoint. Male survival in the highest treatment group was reduced relative to the controls. Percent egg fertility was reduced in the highest treatment group, resulting in an estimated NOEC of 1.79 mg/L. While no effect on gonadal-somatic index (GSI) was observed for males, female GSI was increased in the 5.11 mg/L treatment. Vitellogenin production was not altered relative to the controls for all TFM treatment groups. However, female testosterone was elevated in the 5.11 mg/L treatment. The results suggest that prolonged exposure to TFM at concentrations exceeding 1.79 mg/L has the potential to disrupt endocrine function. Biologically relevant effects in this study were found at the highest exposure concentration following a 21-day exposure. However, the duration of exposure in this study is not consistent with typical treatment durations (12-h) for sea lamprey control. This article is protected by copyright.

302542,Influenza,1983,"Importance: In December 2019, novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)-infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, China. The number of cases has increased rapidly but information on the clinical characteristics of affected patients is limited. Objective: To describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of NCIP. Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective, single-center case series of the 138 consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed NCIP at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University in Wuhan, China, from January 1 to January 28, 2020; final date of follow-up was February 3, 2020. Exposures: Documented NCIP. Main Outcomes and Measures: Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and treatment data were collected and analyzed. Outcomes of critically ill patients and noncritically ill patients were compared. Presumed hospital-related transmission was suspected if a cluster of health professionals or hospitalized patients in the same wards became infected and a possible source of infection could be tracked. Results: Of 138 hospitalized patients with NCIP, the median age was 56 years (interquartile range, 42-68; range, 22-92 years) and 75 (54.3%) were men. Hospital-associated transmission was suspected as the presumed mechanism of infection for affected health professionals (40 [29%]) and hospitalized patients (17 [12.3%]). Common symptoms included fever (136 [98.6%]), fatigue (96 [69.6%]), and dry cough (82 [59.4%]). Lymphopenia (lymphocyte count, 0.8 × 109/L [interquartile range {IQR}, 0.6-1.1]) occurred in 97 patients (70.3%), prolonged prothrombin time (13.0 seconds [IQR, 12.3-13.7]) in 80 patients (58%), and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (261 U/L [IQR, 182-403]) in 55 patients (39.9%). Chest computed tomographic scans showed bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacity in the lungs of all patients. Most patients received antiviral therapy (oseltamivir, 124 [89.9%]), and many received antibacterial therapy (moxifloxacin, 89 [64.4%]; ceftriaxone, 34 [24.6%]; azithromycin, 25 [18.1%]) and glucocorticoid therapy (62 [44.9%]). Thirty-six patients (26.1%) were transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) because of complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (22 [61.1%]), arrhythmia (16 [44.4%]), and shock (11 [30.6%]). The median time from first symptom to dyspnea was 5.0 days, to hospital admission was 7.0 days, and to ARDS was 8.0 days. Patients treated in the ICU (n = 36), compared with patients not treated in the ICU (n = 102), were older (median age, 66 years vs 51 years), were more likely to have underlying comorbidities (26 [72.2%] vs 38 [37.3%]), and were more likely to have dyspnea (23 [63.9%] vs 20 [19.6%]), and anorexia (24 [66.7%] vs 31 [30.4%]). Of the 36 cases in the ICU, 4 (11.1%) received high-flow oxygen therapy, 15 (41.7%) received noninvasive ventilation, and 17 (47.2%) received invasive ventilation (4 were switched to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation). As of February 3, 47 patients (34.1%) were discharged and 6 died (overall mortality, 4.3%), but the remaining patients are still hospitalized. Among those discharged alive (n = 47), the median hospital stay was 10 days (IQR, 7.0-14.0). Conclusions and Relevance: In this single-center case series of 138 hospitalized patients with confirmed NCIP in Wuhan, China, presumed hospital-related transmission of 2019-nCoV was suspected in 41% of patients, 26% of patients received ICU care, and mortality was 4.3%.","Wang, Dawei; Hu, Bo; Hu, Chang; Zhu, Fangfang; Liu, Xing; Zhang, Jing; Wang, Binbin; Xiang, Hui; Cheng, Zhenshun; Xiong, Yong; Zhao, Yan; Li, Yirong; Wang, Xinghuan; Peng, Zhiyong",JAMA,,192
304398,Bayesian inference of 1D activity profiles from segmented gamma scanning of a heterogeneous radioactive waste drum,2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic could lead to disruptions to provision of HIV services for people living with HIV and those at risk of acquiring HIV in sub-Saharan Africa, where UNAIDS estimated that more than two-thirds of the approximately 38 million people living with HIV resided in 2018. We aimed to predict the potential effects of such disruptions on HIV-related deaths and new infections in sub-Saharan Africa. METHODS: In this modelling study, we used five well described models of HIV epidemics (Goals, Optima HIV, HIV Synthesis, an Imperial College London model, and Epidemiological MODeling software [EMOD]) to estimate the effect of various potential disruptions to HIV prevention, testing, and treatment services on HIV-related deaths and new infections in sub-Saharan Africa lasting 6 months over 1 year from April 1, 2020. We considered scenarios in which disruptions affected 20%, 50%, and 100% of the population. FINDINGS: A 6-month interruption of supply of antiretroviral therapy (ART) drugs across 50% of the population of people living with HIV who are on treatment would be expected to lead to a 1·63 times (median across models; range 1·39-1·87) increase in HIV-related deaths over a 1-year period compared with no disruption. In sub-Saharan Africa, this increase amounts to a median excess of HIV deaths, across all model estimates, of 296â000 (range 229â023-420â000) if such a high level of disruption occurred. Interruption of ART would increase mother-to-child transmission of HIV by approximately 1·6 times. Although an interruption in the supply of ART drugs would have the largest impact of any potential disruptions, effects of poorer clinical care due to overstretched health facilities, interruptions of supply of other drugs such as co-trimoxazole, and suspension of HIV testing would all have a substantial effect on population-level mortality (up to a 1·06 times increase in HIV-related deaths over a 1-year period due to disruptions affecting 50% of the population compared with no disruption). Interruption to condom supplies and peer education would make populations more susceptible to increases in HIV incidence, although physical distancing measures could lead to reductions in risky sexual behaviour (up to 1·19 times increase in new HIV infections over a 1-year period if 50% of people are affected). INTERPRETATION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the primary priority for governments, donors, suppliers, and communities should focus on maintaining uninterrupted supply of ART drugs for people with HIV to avoid additional HIV-related deaths. The provision of other HIV prevention measures is also important to prevent any increase in HIV incidence.

304518,From the President,2021,"Since the beginning of the year, the world's attention has rightly been focused on the spread of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and the implementation of drastic mitigation strategies to limit disease transmission. However, public health information campaigns tailored to children are very rare. Now more than ever, at a time when some governments are taking populations out of lockdown and youth are returning to schools, children around the world need to fully grasp the modes of transmission of the disease, the health risks, the scientific notions of the immune system, the value of barrier measures, and the progress of scientific research. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, comics can be very useful for communicating quickly and effectively abstract and important information to children who might be under the influence of a large amount of sometimes contradictory information. Conveying precise, reliable, and accessible information to children is key in a world overwhelmingly impacted by the outbreak. This should be the role and the responsibility of world health official leaders and governments in compliance with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. In partnership with mainstream medias, consortia of scientists, communication experts, and education specialists, it is urgent that world leaders engage children in this worldwide public health fight.","Ghia, Jean-Eric; Gaulin, Sophie; Ghia, Laure; Garancher, Laure; Flamand, Claude",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,,192

310134,Restoring Vaccine Diplomacy,2021,"Facing the COVID-19 global healthcare crisis, scientists worldwide are collaborating to develop prophylactic and therapeutic interventions against the disease. Antibody therapeutics hold enormous promise for the treatment of COVID-19. In March 2020, the Chinese Antibody Society, in collaboration with The Antibody Society, initiated the ""COVID-19 Antibody Therapeutics Tracker"" (""Tracker"") (https://chineseantibody.org/covid-19-track/) program to track the antibody-based COVID-19 interventions in preclinical and clinical development globally. The data are collected from the public domain and verified by volunteers on an ongoing basis. Here, we present exploratory data analyses and visualization to demonstrate the latest trends of COVID-19 antibody development, based on data for over 150 research and development programs and molecules included in the ""Tracker"" as of 8 August 2020. We categorized the data mainly by their targets, formats, development status, developers and country of origin. Although details are limited in some cases, all of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody candidates appear to target the viral spike protein (S protein), and most are full-length monoclonal antibodies. Most of the current COVID-19 antibody therapeutic candidates in clinical trials are repurposed drugs aimed at targets other than virus-specific proteins, while most of these virus-specific therapeutic antibodies are in discovery or preclinical studies. As of 8 August 2020, eight antibody candidates targeting the SARS-CoV-2 S protein have entered clinical studies, including LY-CoV555, REGN-COV2, JS016, TY027, CT-P59, BRII-196, BRII-198 and SCTA01. Ongoing clinical trials of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies will help define the utility of these antibodies as a new class of therapeutics for treating COVID-19 and future coronavirus infections.","Yang, Lifei; Liu, Weihan; Yu, Xin; Wu, Meng; Reichert, Janice M; Ho, Mitchell",Antib Ther,,192

Here we demonstrate that exposure of AN to the biologically-important inflammatory oxidant, peroxynitrous acid (ONOOH), either as a bolus or formed at low levels in a time-dependent manner from SIN-1, impairs the capability of AN to polymerize FN. In contrast, exposure of FN to ONOOH does not seem to affect superfibronectin formation to the same extent. This oxidant-induced loss-of-function in AN occurs in a dose-dependent manner, and correlates with structural perturbations, loss of the amino acid tyrosine and tryptophan, and dose-dependent formation of modified amino acid side-chains (3-nitrotyrosine, di-tyrosine and 6-nitrotryptophan). Reagent ONOOH also induces formation of oligomeric species which decrease in the presence of bicarbonate, whereas SIN-1 mainly generates dimers. Modifications were detected at sub-stoichiometric (0.1-fold), or greater, molar excesses of oxidant compared to AN. These species have been localized to specific sites by peptide mass mapping. With high levels of oxidant (>100 times molar excess), ONOOH also induces unfolding of the beta-sheet structure of AN, thermal destabilization, and formation of high molecular mass aggregates. These results have important implications for the understanding of FN fibrillogenesis in vivo, and indicates that AN is highly sensitive to pathophysiological levels of oxidants such as ONOOH.","He, Jianfei; Becares, Eva Ramos; Thulstrup, Peter Waaben; Gamon, Luke F; Pedersen, Jannik Nedergaard; Otzen, Daniel; Gourdon, Pontus; Davies, Michael J; Hägglund, Per",Redox Biol,,192

316152,Physiology-forward identification of bile acid-sensitive vomeronasal receptors,2020,"AIM: To evaluate the diagnostic worth of elevated serum ACE (sACE) and lymphopaenia, singly or combined, in diagnosing sarcoid uveitis. METHODS: Monocentric retrospective study, on a cohort of 996 adult patients referred to our department between March 2001 and December 2018 for a diagnostic work-up of uveitis. The sensitivity (SE), specificity (Sp), positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of the two biomarkers were calculated in different contexts. RESULTS: Eight hundred and sixty-eight patient cases were reviewed. The mean age at uveitis onset was 49.4 (±18.6) years. Of them, 144 patients had a diagnosis of sarcoid uveitis. An elevated sACE had SE of 45.8%, Sp of 88.8%, PPV of 44.9% and NPV of 89.2% in diagnosing sarcoid uveitis. For lymphopaenia, SE was 15.3%, Sp was 96.7%, PPV was 47.8% and NPV was 85.2%. For the combination of elevated sACE and lymphopaenia, SE was 18.9%, Sp was 99.0%, PPV was 73.9% and NPV was 89.5%. The value of this combination varied according to patient age at diagnosis plus anatomoclinical entities: for patients aged &#8804;50 years, SE was 31.3%, Sp was 99.7%, PPV was 90.9% and NPV was 94.3%. For granulomatous uveitis, SE was 26.2%, Sp was 97.3%, PPV was 73.3% and NPV was 82.5%. CONCLUSION: A combination of elevated serum ACE and lymphopaenia more convincingly suggests sarcoid uveitis than these investigational tests used alone, especially in patients with granulomatous uveitis, while a lack of these markers corresponds to a high NPV.

Computer-assisted learning systems with aggregating IoT applications and smart devices have improved the e-learning systems by enabling remote monitoring and screening of the behavioral aspects of teaching and education scores of students. On the other side, educational data mining has improved the higher education systems by predicting and analyzing the behavioral aspects of teaching and education scores of students. Due to an unexpected and huge increase in the number of patients during coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, all universities, campuses, schools, research centers, many scientific collaborations and meetings have closed and forced to initiate online teaching, e-learning and virtual meeting. Due to importance of behavioral aspects of teaching and education between lecturers and students, prediction of quality of experience (QoE) in virtual education systems is a critical issue. This paper presents a new prediction model to detect technical aspects of teaching and e-learning in virtual education systems using data mining. Association rules mining and supervised techniques are applied to detect efficient QoE factors on virtual education systems. The experimental results described that the suggested prediction model meets the proper accuracy, precision and recall factors for predicting the behavioral aspects of teaching and e-learning for students in virtual education systems.","Tan, Chen; Lin, Jianzhong",Soft comput,,192

Multimodal monitoring of patients with COVID-19 may delineate the specific features of COVID-19-related encephalopathy and guide clinical management. Objectives: To investigate clinical, biological, and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in association with electroencephalographic (EEG) features for patients with COVID-19, and to better refine the features of COVID-19-related encephalopathy. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study conducted in Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, Paris, France, enrolled 78 hospitalized adults who received a diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov2) and underwent EEG between March 30 and June 11, 2020. Exposures: Detection of SARS-CoV-2 from a nasopharyngeal specimen using a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay or, in the case of associated pneumonia, on a computed tomography scan of the chest. Main Outcomes and Measures: Data on the clinical and paraclinical features of the 78 patients with COVID-19 were retrieved from electronic patient records. Results: Of 644 patients who were hospitalized for COVID-19, 78 (57 men [73%]; mean [SD] age, 61 [12] years) underwent EEG. The main indications for EEG were delirium, seizure-like events, and delayed awakening in the intensive care unit after stopping treatment with sedatives. Sixty-nine patients showed pathologic EEG findings, including metabolic-toxic encephalopathy features, frontal abnormalities, periodic discharges, and epileptic activities. Of 57 patients who underwent brain MRI, 41 showed abnormalities, including perfusion abnormalities, acute ischemic lesions, multiple microhemorrhages, and white matter-enhancing lesions. Fifty-five patients showed biological abnormalities, including dysnatremia, kidney failure, and liver dysfunction, the same day as the EEG. The results of cerebrospinal fluid analysis were negative for SARS-Cov-2 for all tested patients. Nine patients who had no identifiable cause of brain injury outside COVID-19 were further isolated; their brain injury was defined as COVID-19-related encephalopathy. They represented 1% (9 of 644) of patients with COVID-19 requiring hospitalization. Six of these 9 patients had movement disorders, 7 had frontal syndrome, 4 had brainstem impairment, 4 had periodic EEG discharges, and 3 had MRI white matter-enhancing lesions. Conclusions and Relevance: The results from this cohort of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 suggest there are clinical, EEG, and MRI patterns that could delineate specific COVID-19-related encephalopathy and guide treatment strategy.","Lambrecq, Virginie; Hanin, Aurélie; Munoz-Musat, Esteban; Chougar, Lydia; Gassama, Salimata; Delorme, Cécile; Cousyn, Louis; Borden, Alaina; Damiano, Maria; Frazzini, Valerio; Huberfeld, Gilles; Landgraf, Frank; Nguyen-Michel, Vi-Huong; Pichit, Phintip; Sangare, Aude; Chavez, Mario; Morélot-Panzini, Capucine; Morawiec, Elise; Raux, Mathieu; Luyt, Charles-Edouard; Rufat, Pierre; Galanaud, Damien; Corvol, Jean-Christophe; Lubetzki, Catherine; Rohaut, Benjamin; Demeret, Sophie; Pyatigorskaya, Nadya; Naccache, Lionel; Navarro, Vincent",JAMA Netw Open,,192

While social media can serve as a useful tool for effective communication during disease outbreaks, few studies have elucidated how these platforms are used by the Ministry of Health (MOH) during disease outbreaks in Saudi Arabia. OBJECTIVE: Guided by the Crisis and Emergency Risk Communication model, this study aimed to explore the MOH's use of Twitter and the public's engagement during different stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia. METHODS: Tweets and corresponding likes and retweets were extracted from the official Twitter account of the MOH in Saudi Arabia for the period of January 1 through August 31, 2020. Tweets related to COVID-19 were identified; subsequently, content analysis was performed, in which tweets were coded for the following message types: risk messages, warnings, preparations, uncertainty reduction, efficacy, reassurance, and digital health responses. Public engagement was measured by examining the numbers of likes and retweets. The association between outbreak stages and types of messages was assessed, as well as the effect of these messages on public engagement. RESULTS: The MOH posted a total of 1393 original tweets during the study period. Of the total tweets, 1293 (92.82%) were related to COVID-19, and 1217 were ultimately included in the analysis. The MOH posted the majority of its tweets (65.89%) during the initial stage of the outbreak. Accordingly, the public showed the highest level of engagement (as indicated by numbers of likes and retweets) during the initial stage. The types of messages sent by the MOH significantly differed across outbreak stages, with messages related to uncertainty reduction, reassurance, and efficacy being prevalent among all stages. Tweet content, media type, and crisis stage influenced the level of public engagement. Engagement was negatively associated with the inclusion of hyperlinks and multimedia files, while higher level of public engagement was associated with the use of hashtags. Tweets related to warnings, uncertainty reduction, and reassurance received high levels of public engagement. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides insights into the Saudi MOH's communication strategy during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our results have implications for researchers, governments, health organizations, and practitioners with regard to their communication practices during outbreaks. To increase public engagement, governments and health authorities should consider the public's need for information. This, in turn, could raise public awareness regarding disease outbreaks.","Alhassan, Fatimah Mohammed; AlDossary, Sharifah Abdullah",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,192
323157,"Probabilistic Epigenesis, Experience, and Psychological Development in Infancy",2000,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) presents unique challenges in health care, including mental health care provision. Telepsychiatry can provide an alternative to face-to-face assessment and can also be used creatively with other technologies to enhance care, but clinicians and patients may feel underconfident about embracing this new way of working. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to produce an open-access, easy-to-consult, and reliable source of information and guidance about telepsychiatry and COVID-19 using an evidence-based approach. METHODS: We systematically searched existing English language guidelines and websites for information on telepsychiatry in the context of COVID-19 up to and including May 2020. We used broad search criteria and included pre-COVID-19 guidelines and other digital mental health topics where relevant. We summarized the data we extracted as answers to specific clinical questions. RESULTS: Findings from this study are presented as both a short practical checklist for clinicians and detailed textboxes with a full summary of all the guidelines. The summary textboxes are also available on an open-access webpage, which is regularly updated. These findings reflected the strong evidence base for the use of telepsychiatry and included guidelines for many of the common concerns expressed by clinicians about practical implementation, technology, information governance, and safety. Guidelines across countries differ significantly, with UK guidelines more conservative and focused on practical implementation and US guidelines more expansive and detailed. Guidelines on possible combinations with other digital technologies such as apps (eg, from the US Food and Drug Administration, the National Health Service Apps Library, and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) are less detailed. Several key areas were not represented. Although some special populations such as child and adolescent, and older adult, and cultural issues are specifically included, important populations such as learning disabilities, psychosis, personality disorder, and eating disorders, which may present particular challenges for telepsychiatry, are not. In addition, the initial consultation and follow-up sessions are not clearly distinguished. Finally, a hybrid model of care (combining telepsychiatry with other technologies and in-person care) is not explicitly covered by the existing guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: We produced a comprehensive synthesis of guidance answering a wide range of clinical questions in telepsychiatry. This meets the urgent need for practical information for both clinicians and health care organizations who are rapidly adapting to the pandemic and implementing remote consultation. It reflects variations across countries and can be used as a basis for organizational change in the short- and long-term. Providing easily accessible guidance is a first step but will need cultural change to implement as clinicians start to view telepsychiatry not just as a replacement but as a parallel and complementary form of delivering therapy with its own advantages and benefits as well as restrictions. A combination or hybrid approach can be the most successful approach in the new world of mental health post-COVID-19, and guidance will need to expand to encompass the use of telepsychiatry in conjunction with other in-person and digital technologies, and its use across all psychiatric disorders, not just those who are the first to access and engage with remote treatment.","Smith, Katharine; Ostinelli, Edoardo; Macdonald, Orla; Cipriani, Andrea",JMIR Ment Health,,192

Sickle cell disease (SCD) and sickle cell trait (SCT) are genetic conditions that occur predominantly among Black individuals. It is unknown if individuals with SCD/SCT are at higher risk of severe COVID-19 illness compared with Black individuals who do not have SCD/SCT. The objective of our study was to compare COVID-19 outcomes, including the disease manifestations, hospitalization, and death, among individuals with SCD/SCT vs Black individuals who do not have SCD/SCT. We leveraged electronic health record data from a multisite research network to identify Black patients with COVID-19 who have SCD/SCT and those who do not have SCD/SCT. During the study period of 20 January 2020 to 20 September 2020, there were 312 patients with COVID-19 and SCD and 449 patients with COVID-19 and SCT. There were 45 517 Black persons who were diagnosed with COVID-19 but who did not have SCD/SCT. After 1:1 propensity score matching (based on age, sex, and other preexisting comorbidities), patients with COVID-19 and SCD remained at a higher risk of hospitalization (relative risk [RR], 2.0; 95% CI, 1.5-2.7) and development of pneumonia (RR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.6-3.4) and pain (RR, 3.4; 95% CI, 2.5-4.8) compared with Black persons without SCD/SCT. The case fatality rates for those with SCD compared with Black persons without SCD/SCT were not significantly different. There also were no significant differences in COVID-19 outcomes between individuals with SCT and Black persons without SCD/SCT within the matched cohorts.","Singh, Ashima; Brandow, Amanda M; Panepinto, Julie A",Blood Adv,,192

This review details the latest evidence on the neuropathogenesis and neurologic complications of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. RECENT FINDINGS: Commonly reported neurologic complications include toxic-metabolic encephalopathy, acute cerebrovascular disorders, seizures, and anoxic-brain injury. These complications represent secondary injury due to COVID-19 related hypoxia, sepsis, hypercoagulability, or hyperinflammation. Postinfectious complications, such as encephalitis, postinfectious demyelination, and Guillain-Barré syndrome have been reported, but are rare. Recent reports of persistent neurocognitive symptoms highlight the possibility of lasting impairment. SUMMARY: Although some neurologic complications should be treated with standard practices, further investigations are still needed to determine the optimal treatment of COVID-related neurologic complications, such as ischemic stroke. Entering into the next phase of the pandemic, investigations into the long-term neurologic and cognitive impacts of SARS-CoV-2 infection will be needed. Clinicians must have a high clinical suspicion for both acute and chronic neurologic complications among COVID-19 patients.","Hassett, Catherine E; Frontera, Jennifer A",Curr Opin Infect Dis,,192

Here, we evaluated two independent molecular assays, the Biomeme SARS-CoV-2 test, and the Precision Biomonitoring TripleLock SARS-CoV-2 test on a field-deployable point-of-care real-time PCR instrument, Franklin three9, in combination with Biomeme M1 Sample Prep Cartridge Kit for RNA 2.0 (M1) manual extraction system for rapid, specific, and sensitive detection of SARS-COV-2 in cell culture, human, and animal clinical samples. The Biomeme SARS-CoV-2 assay, which simultaneously detects two viral targets, the orf1ab and S genes, and the Precision Biomonitoring TripleLock SARS-CoV-2 assay that targets the 5' untranslated region (5' UTR) and the envelope (E) gene of SARS-CoV-2 were highly sensitive and detected as low as 15 SARS-CoV-2 genome copies per reaction. In addition, the two assays were specific and showed no cross-reactivity with Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) virus, and other common human respiratory viruses and bacterial pathogens. Also, both assays were highly reproducible across different operators and instruments. When used to test animal samples, both assays equally detected SARS-CoV-2 genetic materials in the swabs from SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters. The M1 lysis buffer completely inactivated SARS-CoV-2 within 10 min at room temperature enabling safe handling of clinical samples. Collectively, these results show that the Biomeme and Precision Biomonitoring TripleLock SARS-CoV-2 mobile testing platforms could reliably and promptly detect SARS-CoV-2 in both human and animal clinical samples in approximately an hour and can be used in remote areas or health care settings not traditionally serviced by a microbiology laboratory.","Onyilagha, Chukwunonso; Mistry, Henna; Marszal, Peter; Pinette, Mathieu; Kobasa, Darwyn; Tailor, Nikesh; Berhane, Yohannes; Nfon, Charles; Pickering, Bradley; Mubareka, Samira; Bulir, David; Chong, Sylvia; Kozak, Robert; Ambagala, Aruna",Sci Rep,,192

Multiple data sets including videos of research lessons, debriefings and audios of interviews were collected. From the expansive learning perspective, based on a fine-grained qualitative data analysis, various contradictions (as driving forces of learning) were identified and the ways of resolving the contradictions (as enactment of learning) were located to feature teacher learning throughout the online lesson study process.FindingsTeachers' expansive learning includes enhancing teachers' MKT and Mathematics TPACK, developing instructional design skills and capabilities in addressing challenges occurring in the virtual environment were identified.Research limitations/implicationsTheoretically, the study illustrated how expansive learning theory could be utilized to examine teacher collaborative learning in the online cross-cultural lesson study. Practically, this study showed that reiterative cycles and experts' facilitation are crucial to expansive learning for linking research to classroom practice. However, this study did not focus on student learning in the virtual environment. Australian teachers' reciprocal learning through the online lesson study also requires further exploration.Originality/valueBoth online lesson study and cross-cultural collaboration are innovative.

Specifically, in silico method was employed to simulate protein degradation by gastrointestinal enzymes and to produce a large number of active peptides, then, the binding ability of these peptides to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) was evaluated. The results showed that wheat-derived alpha/beta-gliadin, oat-derived avenin, and ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase small chain of different origin could be good protein source in generating potent binders to SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD. In addition, some high-affinity oligopeptides (such as PISCR, VQVVN, PQQQF, etc.) were identified as potential binders of SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD.

Several genetic variants are associated with COVID-19 severity. Studies have proposed associations, based on a very small sample and a large number of tested HLA alleles, but no clear association between HLA and COVID-19 incidence or severity has been reported. We conducted a large-scale HLA analysis of Israeli individuals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection by PCR. Overall, 72,912 individuals with known HLA haplotypes were included in the study, of whom 6413 (8.8%) were found to have SARS-CoV-2 by PCR. A total of 20,937 subjects were of Ashkenazi origin (at least 2/4 grandparents). One hundred eighty-one patients (2.8% of the infected) were hospitalized due to the disease. None of the 66 most common HLA loci (within the five HLA subgroups: A, B, C, DQB1, DRB1) was found to be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection or hospitalization in the general Israeli population. Similarly, no association was detected in the Ashkenazi Jewish subset. Moreover, no association was found between heterozygosity in any of the HLA loci and either infection or hospitalization. We conclude that HLA haplotypes are not a major risk/protecting factor among the Israeli population for SARS-CoV-2 infection or severity. Our results suggest that if any HLA association exists with the disease it is very weak, and of limited effect on the pandemic.","Shachar, Shay Ben; Barda, Noam; Manor, Sigal; Israeli, Sapir; Dagan, Noa; Carmi, Shai; Balicer, Ran; Zisser, Bracha; Louzoun, Yoram",J. clin. immunol,,192

343301,Calling All Rheumatologists!,2020,"Inhaled Corticosteroids (ICS) are commonly prescribed to patients with severe COPD and recurrent exacerbations. It is not known what impact ICS cause in terms of COVID-19 positivity or disease severity in COPD. This study examined 27,810 patients with COPD from the Cleveland Clinic COVID-19 registry between March 8th and September 16th, 2020. Electronic health records were used to determine diagnosis of COPD, ICS use, and clinical outcomes. Multivariate logistic regression was used to adjust for demographics, month of COVID-19 testing, and comorbidities known to be associated with increased risk for severe COVID-19 disease. Amongst the COPD patients who were tested for COVID-19, 44.1% of those taking an ICS-containing inhaler tested positive for COVID-19 versus 47.2% who tested negative for COVID-19 (p = 0.033). Of those who tested positive for COVID-19 (n = 1288), 371 (28.8%) required hospitalization. In-hospital outcomes were not significantly different when comparing ICS versus no ICS in terms of ICU admission (36.8% [74/201] vs 31.2% [53/170], p = 0.30), endotracheal intubation (21.9% [44/201] vs 16.5% [28/170], p = 0.24), or mortality (18.4% [37/201] vs 20.0% [34/170], p = 0.80). Multivariate logistic regression demonstrated no significant differences in hospitalization (adj OR 1.12, CI: 0.90-1.38), ICU admission (adj OR: 1.31, CI: 0.82-2.10), need for mechanical ventilation (adj OR 1.65, CI: 0.69-4.02), or mortality (OR: 0.80, CI: 0.43-1.49). In conclusion, ICS therapy did not increase COVID-19 related healthcare utilization or mortality outcome in patients with COPD followed at the Cleveland Clinic health system. These findings should encourage clinicians to continue ICS therapy for COPD patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Sen, Payal; Majumdar, Uddalak; Zein, Joe; Hatipoglu, Umur; Attaway, Amy H",PLoS One,,192

A cross-sectional study was conducted and medical workers in Ningbo, China were recruited. Sleep quality was evaluated by Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Mental health status was evaluated by Symptom Checklist 90 (SCL-90). Logistic regression and generalized multi-factor dimensionality reduction (GMDR) analysis were utilized to explore the risk factors and their interactions on sleep quality and mental health status. 207 participants were surveyed, and 34.30% were found with poor sleep quality (total PSQI score > 10), mainly manifested as sleep disturbance (92.75%). 27.05% were found with mental symptoms (Global severity index > 1.50), mainly manifested as obsessive-compulsive (25.60%). Multivariate logistic analysis showed that male (OR 3.89, 95% CI 1.06-14.24, P = 0.04), working years > 15 years (OR 4.51, 95% CI 1.56-13.00, P = 0.01), nurse (OR 5.64, 95% CI 1.35-23.63, P = 0.02), more night shifts (OR 3.10, 95% CI 1.31-7.34, P = 0.01), and supporting Wuhan (OR 3.41, 95% CI 1.12-10.40, P = 0.03) were associated with poor sleep quality. GMDR analysis showed that there was a two-factor interaction between working years and working shifts (P = 0.01). No significant factors and interactions were found associated with mental symptoms. In conclusions, about one-third of medical workers suffered from sleep and mental problems during the COVID-19 pandemic in the current study.

345995,"Safety of Minimally Invasive Tissue Extraction in Fibroid Management, A Systematic Review",2020,"Many complex diseases are expressed with high incidence only in certain populations. Genealogy studies determine that these diseases are inherited with a high probability. However, genetic studies have been unable to identify the genomic signatures responsible for such heritability, as identifying the genetic variants that make a population prone to a given disease is not enough to explain its high occurrence within the population. This gap is known as the missing heritability problem. We know that the microbiota plays a very important role in determining many important phenotypic characteristics of its host, in particular the complex diseases for which the missing heritability occurs. Therefore, when computing the heritability of a phenotype, it is important to consider not only the genetic variation in the host but also in its microbiota. Here we test this hypothesis by studying an evolutionary model based on gene regulatory networks. Our results show that the holobiont (the host plus its microbiota) is capable of generating a much larger variability than the host alone, greatly reducing the missing heritability of the phenotype. This result strongly suggests that a considerably large part of the missing heritability can be attributed to the microbiome.","Huitzil, Saúl; Sandoval-Motta, Santiago; Frank, Alejandro; Aldana, Maximino",Results Probl Cell Differ,,192

348402,When did coronavirus arrive in Europe?,2021,"BACKGROUND: There has been uncertainty about the safety or benefit of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors during the Covid-19 pandemic. We used Mendelian randomization using genetic determinants of serum-ACE levels to test whether decreased ACE levels increase susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection or Covid-19 severity, while reducing potential bias from confounding and reverse causation in observational studies. METHODS: Genetic variants strongly associated with ACE levels, which were nearby the ACE gene, were identified from the ORIGIN trial and a separate genome-wide association study (GWAS) of ACE levels from the AGES cohort. The ORIGIN trial included 4147 individuals of European and Latino ancestries. Sensitivity analyses were performed using a study of 3200 Icelanders. Cohorts from the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative GWAS of up to 960 186 individuals of European ancestry were used for Covid-19 susceptibility, hospitalization and severe-disease outcome. RESULTS: Genetic variants were identified that explain between 18% and 37% of variance in ACE levels. Using genetic variants from the ORIGIN trial, a standard-deviation decrease in ACE levels was not associated with an increase in Covid-19 susceptibility [odds ratio (OR): 1.02, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.90, 1.15], hospitalization (OR: 0.86, 95% CI: 0.68, 1.08) or severe disease (OR: 0.74, 95% CI: 0.51, 1.06). Using genetic variants from the AGES cohort, the result was similar for susceptibility (OR: 0.98, 95% CI: 0.89, 1.09), hospitalization (OR: 0.86, 95% CI: 0.66, 1.11) and severity (OR: 0.75, 95% CI: 0.50, 1.14). Multiple-sensitivity analyses led to similar results. CONCLUSION: Genetically decreased serum ACE levels were not associated with susceptibility to, or severity of, Covid-19 disease. These data suggest that individuals taking ACE inhibitors should not discontinue therapy during the Covid-19 pandemic.","Butler-Laporte, Guillaume; Nakanishi, Tomoko; Mooser, Vincent; Renieri, Alessandra; Amitrano, Sara; Zhou, Sirui; Chen, Yiheng; Forgetta, Vincenzo; Richards, J Brent",Int. j. epidemiol,,192

We describe the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on the emergency ambulance system in Victoria, Australia.Methods: We performed an interrupted time series analysis of consecutive calls for ambulance from January 2018 to February 2021, including two waves of COVID-19. The COVID-19 lockdown period included seven months of stay-at-home restrictions (16/03/2020-18/10/2020). Nineteen weeks of post-lockdown data were included (19/10/2020-28/02/2021).Results: In total, 2,356,326 consecutive calls were included. COVID-19 lockdown was associated with an absolute reduction of 64,991 calls (almost 2,100 calls/week). According to time series analysis, lockdown was associated with a 12.6% reduction in weekly calls (IRR = 0.874 [95% CI 0.811, 0.941]), however no change in long-term trend (IRR = 1.000 [95% CI 0.996, 1.003]). During lockdown, the long-term trend of attendances to patients with suspected acute coronary syndromes (ACS, IRR = 1.006 [95% CI 1.004, 1.009]) and mental health-related issues (IRR = 1.005 [95% CI 1.002, 1.008]) increased. After lockdown, the call volume was 5.6% below pre-COVID-19 predictions (IRR = 0.944 [95% CI 0.909, 0.980]), however attendances for suspected ACS were higher than predicted (IRR = 1.069 [95% CI 1.009, 1.132]). Ambulance response times deteriorated, and total case times were longer than prior to the pandemic, driven predominantly by extended hospital transfer times.Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic had a dramatic impact on the emergency ambulance system. Despite lower call volumes post-lockdown than predicted, we observed deteriorating ambulance response times, extended case times and hospital delays. The pattern of attendance to patients with suspected ACS potentially highlights the collateral burden of delaying treatment for urgent conditions.","Andrew, Emily; Nehme, Ziad; Stephenson, Michael; Walker, Tony; Smith, Karen",Prehosp Emerg Care,,192

Initially, the infection spread locally, affecting the Wuhan people, and then expanded rapidly throughout the world. On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) proclaimed it a global pandemic. The virus is a new strain most closely related to a bat coronavirus (RaTG13) which was not previously discovered in humans and is now formally known as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the disease syndrome that the SARS-CoV-2 virus triggers. It is suggested that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted through aerosols, direct/indirect contact, and also during medical procedures and specimen handling. The infection is characterized by isolated flu-like symptoms, but there may be specific signs of fever, fatigue, cough, and shortness of breath, as well as the loss of smell and breathing difficulty. Within this report, we tried to review the most current scientific literature published by January 2021 on various aspects of the outbreak, including virus structure, pathogenesis, clinical presentation, epidemiology, diagnostic approaches, potential therapeutics and vaccines, and prospects. We hope this article makes a beneficial impact on public education to better deal with the SARS-CoV-2 crisis and push a step forward in the near term towards its prevention and control.","Beig Parikhani, Arezoo; Bazaz, Masoume; Bamehr, Hadi; Fereshteh, Sepideh; Amiri, Shahin; Salehi-Vaziri, Mostafa; Arashkia, Arash; Azadmanesh, Kayhan",Curr Microbiol,,192

351098,LOCATER: Cleaning WiFi Connectivity Datasets for Semantic Localization,2020-04-20,"OBJECTIVE: Human infections with zoonotic coronavirus contain emerging and reemerging pathogenic characteristics which have raised great public health concern. This study aimed at investigating the global prevalence, biological and clinical characteristics of novel coronavirus, Wuhan China (2019-nCoV), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection outbreaks. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The data on the global outbreak of ""2019-nCoV, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV"" were obtained from World Health Organization (WHO), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), concerned ministries and research institutes. We also recorded the information from research documents published in global scientific journals indexed in ISI Web of Science and research centers on the prevalence, biological and clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV. RESULTS: Worldwide, SARS-CoV involved 32 countries, with 8422 confirmed cases and 916 (10.87%) casualties from November 2002 to August 2003. MERS-CoV spread over 27 states, causing 2496 cases and 868 (34.77%) fatalities during the period April 2012 to December 2019. However, the novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV spread swiftly the global borders of 27 countries. It infected 34799 people and resulted in 724 (2.08%) casualties during the period December 29, 2019 to February 7, 2020. The fatality rate of coronavirus MERS-CoV was (34.77%) higher than SARS-CoV (10.87%) and 2019-nCoV (2.08%); however, the 2019-nCoV transmitted rapidly in comparison to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. CONCLUSIONS: The novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV has diverse epidemiological and biological characteristics, making it more contagious than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. It has affected more people in a short time period compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, although the fatality rate of MERS-CoV was higher than SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV. The major clinical manifestations in coronavirus infections 2019-nCoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS CoV are fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath, generalized myalgia, malaise, drowsy, diarrhea, confusion, dyspnea, and pneumonia. Global health authorities should take immediate measures to prevent the outbreaks of such emerging and reemerging pathogens across the globe to minimize the disease burden locally and globally.","Meo, S A; Alhowikan, A M; Al-Khlaiwi, T; Meo, I M; Halepoto, D M; Iqbal, M; Usmani, A M; Hajjar, W; Ahmed, N",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,,192

METHODS: A convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained by using pairs of excellent (acquisition time of 6 min/bed position) and standard (acquisition time of 1.5 min/bed position) or sub-standard (acquisition time of 1 min/bed position) images from 72 patients. A test group of 25 patients was used to validate the CNN qualitatively and quantitatively with 5 different image sets per patient: 4 min/bed position, 1.5 min/bed position with and without CNN, and 1 min/bed position with and without CNN. RESULTS: Difference in hotspot maximum or peak standardized uptake value between the standard 1.5 min and 1.5 min CNN images fell short of significance. Coefficient of variation, the noise level, was lower in the CNN-enhanced images compared with standard 1 min and 1.5 min images. Physicians ranked the 1.5 min CNN and the 4 min images highest regarding image quality (noise and contrast) and the standard 1 min images lowest. CONCLUSIONS: AI can enhance [18F]FDG-PET images to reduce noise and increase contrast compared with standard images whilst keeping SUVmax/peak stability. There were significant differences in scoring between the 1.5 min and 1.5 min CNN image sets in all comparisons, the latter had higher scores in noise and contrast. Furthermore, difference in SUVmax and SUVpeak fell short of significance for that pair. The improved image quality can potentially be used either to provide better images to the nuclear medicine physicians or to reduce acquisition time/administered activity.","Ly, John; Minarik, David; Jögi, Jonas; Wollmer, Per; Trägårdh, Elin",EJNMMI Res,,192
352201,Localized and Whole-Room Effects of Portable Air Filtration Units on Aerosol Particle Deposition and Concentration in a Classroom Environment,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Recently, the COVID-19 pandemic has spread globally, necessitating the development of new methods for its prevention and treatment. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the antiviral activity of photodynamic therapy (PDT) against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. METHODS: Vero E6 cells and SARS-CoV-2 isolated in Russia were used for PDT with methylene blue (MB) and Radahlorin. A continuous laser with wavelength &#955; = 662 nm in doses of 16 J/cm2 and 40 J/cm2 laser irradiation was used for PDT of a viral suspension and SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. The direct cytopathogenic effect of SARS-CoV-2 was evaluated via light microscopy to calculate the TCID50 in the samples and perform statistical analysis. RESULTS: Viral suspensions of SARS-CoV-2 that had a TCID50 greater than 103 were inactivated by PDT in the presence of MB and Radahlorin. Vero E6 cells were protected from 104 TCID50 of SARS-CoV-2 by PDT post infection. The range of protective concentrations was 1.0-10.0 µg/ml and 0.5-5.0 µg/ml for MB and Radahlorin, respectively. Additionally, it was found that MB and Radahlorin also possess significant antiviral activity even without PDT. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) against 102 TCID50 of SARS-CoV-2 was found to be 0.22 and 0.33 µg/ml with the addition of MB and Radahlorin, respectively, to cells concomitantly with virus, whereas in the case of applying the photosensitizers at 3.5 hours post infection, the IC50 was 0.6 and 2.0 µg/ml for MB and Radahlorin, respectively. CONCLUSION: PDT shows high antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 when combined with MB and Radahlorin in vitro.","Svyatchenko, Victor A; Nikonov, Sergey D; Mayorov, Alexander P; Gelfond, Mark L; Loktev, Valery B",Photodiagnosis Photodyn Ther,,192

Mass vaccination has been used by public health agencies in the past and is being proposed as a viable option for COVID-19 immunization. To be able to rapidly and safely immunize a large number of people against SARS-CoV-2, different mass vaccination options are available. Drive-through facilities have been successfully used in the past for immunization against other diseases and for testing during COVID-19. In this paper we introduce a drive-through vaccination simulation tool that can be used to enhance the planning, design, operation, and feasibility and effectiveness assessment of such facilities. The simulation tool is a hybrid model that integrates discrete event and agent-based modeling techniques. The simulation outputs visually and numerically show the average processing and waiting times and the number of cars and people that can be served (throughput values) under different numbers of staff, service lanes, screening, registration, immunization, and recovery times.","Asgary, Ali; Najafabadi, Mahdi M; Karsseboom, Richard; Wu, Jianhong",,,192

There is no specific drug for the treatment of COVID-19 patients at this moment. Traditionally, people have been using spices like ginger, fenugreek and onion, etc. for the remedy of a common cold. This work identifies the potential inhibitors of the main protease (Mpro) and spike (S) receptor of SARS-CoV-2 from 10 readily available spices. These two proteins, S and Mpro, play an important role during the virus entry into the host cell, and replication and transcription processes of the virus, respectively. To identify potential molecules an in-house databank containing 1040 compounds was built-up from the selected spices. Structure-based virtual screening of this databank was performed with two important SARS-CoV-2 proteins using Glide. Top hits resulted from virtual screening (VS) were subjected to molecular docking using AutoDock 4.2 and AutoDock Vina to eliminate false positives. The top six hits against Mpro and top five hits against spike receptor subjected to 130 ns molecular dynamic simulation using GROMACS. Finally, the compound 1-, 2-, 3- and 5-Mpro complexes, and compound 17-, 18-, 19-, 20- and 21- spike receptor complexes showed stability throughout the simulation time. The ADME values also supported the drug-like nature of the selected hits. These nine compounds are available in onion, garlic, ginger, peppermint, chili and fenugreek. All the spices are edible and might be used as home remedies against COVID-19 after proper biological evaluation.","Sen, Debanjan; Debnath, Pradip; Debnath, Bimal; Bhaumik, Samhita; Debnath, Sudhan",J Biomol Struct Dyn,,192

Common issues that were raised with the use of telemedicine included difficulty in procuring physical laboratory results and a lack of personal warmth during telemedicine visits. The workflows created based on these suggestions will both enhance safety in treating patients and allow for the best possible care.","Raina, Rupesh; Nair, Nikhil; Sharma, Aditya; Chakraborty, Ronith; Rush, Sarah",,,192

We aimed to investigate age-related differences in symptom presentations of patients tested positive and negative for SARS-CoV-2. DESIGN: SETTING: Calls to the medical helpline (1-8-1-3) and emergency number (1-1-2) in Copenhagen, Denmark. At both medical services all calls are recorded. PARTICIPANTS: We included calls for patients who called for help/guidance at the medical helpline or emergency number prior to receiving a test for SARS-CoV-2 between April 1st and 20th 2020 (8423 patients). Among these calls, we randomly sampled recorded calls from 350 patients who later tested positive and 250 patients tested negative and registered symptoms described in the call. OUTCOME: RESULTS: After exclusions, 544 calls (312 SARS-CoV-2 positive and 232 negative) were included in the analysis. Fever and cough remained the two most common of COVID-19 symptoms across all age groups and approximately 42% of SARS-CoV-2 positive and 20% of negative presented with both fever and cough. Symptoms including nasal congestion, irritation/pain in throat, muscle/joint pain, loss of taste and smell, and headache were common symptoms of COVID-19 for patients younger than 60 years; whereas loss of appetite and feeling unwell were more commonly seen among patients over 60 years. Headache and loss of taste and smell were rare symptoms of COVID-19 among patients over 60 years. CONCLUSION: Our study identified age-related differences in symptom presentations of SARS-CoV-2-positive patients calling for help or medical advice. The specific symptoms of loss of smell or taste almost exclusively reported by patients younger than 60 years. Differences in symptom presentation across age groups must be considered when screening for COVID-19.","Moeller, Amalie Lykkemark; Mills, Elisabeth Helen Anna; Collatz Christensen, Helle; Gnesin, Filip; Blomberg, Stig Nikolaj Fasmer Nikolaj; Zylyftari, Nertila; Jensen, Britta; Ringgren, Kristian Bundgaard; Broccia, Marcella Ditte; Bøggild, Henrik; Torp-Pedersen, Christian",BMJ Open,,192
358058,The Meanings of America,2020,"On May 13, 2020, Chicago established a free community-based testing (CBT) initiative for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The initiative focused on demographic groups and geographic areas that were underrepresented in testing by clinical providers and had experienced high COVID-19 incidence, including Hispanic persons and those who have been economically marginalized. To assess the CBT initiative, the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) compared demographic characteristics, economic marginalization, and test positivity between persons tested at CBT sites and persons tested in all other testing settings in Chicago. During May 13-November 14, a total of 253,904 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests were conducted at CBT sites. Compared with those tested in all other testing settings in Chicago, persons tested at CBT sites were more likely to live in areas that are economically marginalized (38.6% versus 32.0%; p<0.001) and to be Hispanic (50.9% versus 20.7%; p<0.001). The cumulative percentage of positive test results at the CBT sites was higher than that at all other testing settings (11.1% versus 7.1%; p<0.001). These results demonstrate the ability of public health departments to establish community-based testing initiatives that reach communities with less access to testing in other settings and that experience disproportionately higher incidences of COVID-19.","English, Kayla; Lei, Uei; Shipman-Amuwo, Frankie; Burkey, Micah; González, José G; Richardson, Sarah; Chavez-Torres, Maribel; Arwady, M Allison; Anderson, Christina; Layden, Jennifer E; Ruestow, Peter; Pacilli, Massimo; Ghinai, Isaac",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,192

Serum samples (n = 364) were collected from participants from the villages and tested for coronavirus antibodies using a human coronavirus IgG ELISA kit. Our results showed that 10.44% (38/364; 21 males and 17 females) of the villagers had antibodies against human coronaviruses. The odds ratio for coronavirus positivity in the villagers in the central region who were exposed to bats was 4.75, 95% CI 1.04-21.70, when compared to that in the non-exposed villagers. The sociodemographics, knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) of the villagers were also recorded and analysed by using a quantitative structured questionnaire. Our results showed that 62.36% (227/364) of the villagers had been exposed to bats at least once in the past six months. Low monthly family income was statistically significant in increasing the risk for coronavirus seropositivity among the villagers (OR 2.91, 95% CI 1.13-7.49). In-depth interviews among the coronavirus-positive participants (n = 30) showed that cultural context, local norms and beliefs could influence to bat exposure activities. In conclusion, our results provide baseline information on human coronavirus antibodies and KAP regarding to bat exposure among villagers in Thailand.","Suwannarong, Kanokwan; Janetanakit, Taveesak; Kanthawee, Phitsanuruk; Suwannarong, Kangsadal; Theamboonlers, Apiradee; Poovorawan, Yong; Tun, Hein M; Chanabun, Sutin; Amonsin, Alongkorn",Zoonoses Public Health,,192

Moreover, a deeper knowledge of potential changes in the saliva proteome in this disease may allow the identification of new diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, or even help our understanding of the mechanisms associated with the disease. With the development of appropriate sample collection and processing methods and the use of adequate assays, saliva can provide useful clinical information about the disease and could be potentially included in guidelines for sample collection for the diagnosis, disease management, and control of Covid-19.","Ceron, Jose J.; Lamy, Elsa; Martinez-Subiela, Silvia; Lopez-Jornet, Pia; Silva, Fernando Capela E.; Eckersall, Peter David; Tvarijonaviciute, Asta",J.

361934,How to be a good peer reviewer of scientific manuscripts,2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent suppression measures have had health and social implications for billions of individuals. The aim of this paper is to investigate the risk of psychological distress associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and suppression measures during the early days of the lockdown. We compared the level of psychological distress at the beginning of that period with a pre-pandemic health survey and assessed the psychological effects of exposure to the COVID-19 pandemic and changes in social activity and support. METHODS: An online survey was distributed to the general population in Belgium 3 days after the beginning of the lockdown. 20,792 respondents participated. The psychological distress of the population was measured using the GHQ-12 scale. Social activities and support were assessed using the Social Participation Measure, the Short Loneliness Scale, and the Oslo Social Support Scale. An index of subjective exposure to the COVID-19 pandemic was constructed, as well as a measure of change in occupational status. Measurements were compared to a representative sample of individuals extracted from the Belgian Health Interview Survey of 2018. Bootstrapping was performed and analyses were reweighted to match the Belgian population in order to control for survey selection bias. RESULTS: Half of the respondents reported psychological distress in the early days of the lockdown. A longer period of confinement was associated with higher risk of distress. Women and younger age groups were more at risk than men and older age groups, as were respondents who had been exposed to COVID-19. Changes in occupational status and a decrease in social activity and support also increased the risk of psychological distress. Comparing the results with those of the 2018 Belgian Health Interview shows that the early period of the lockdown corresponded to a 2.3-fold increase in psychological distress (95% CI: 2.16-2.45). CONCLUSIONS: Psychological distress is associated with the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic and suppression measures. The association is measurable from the very earliest days of confinement and it affected specific at-risk groups. Authorities should consider ways of limiting the effect of confinement on the mental and social health of the population and developing strategies to mitigate the adverse consequences of suppression measures.","Lorant, Vincent; Smith, Pierre; Van den Broeck, Kris; Nicaise, Pablo",BMC Psychiatry,,192

However, the additional contribution of the second PCR test to the diagnosis is unknown. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this study, we aimed to investigate the contribution of second SARS-CoV-2 PCR to diagnosis in patients with a suspicion of COVID-19 whose initial test was negative. RESULTS: A total of 1449 patients were hospitalized in infectious disease clinics with the suspicion of COVID-19 infection during the study period. We performed the second PCR test (697 nasopharyngeal sample, 5 tracheal aspirate) in 702/766 (91.6%) patients whose first tests were negative and detected as positive in only 6.6% (46) of samples. CONCLUSIONS: The strategy of using the second nasopharyngeal PCR test to confirm or exclude the diagnosis seems to cause the loss of labor and time, and is costly, because its additional contribution to the first test is very low.","Kayaaslan, Bircan; Kalem, Ayse Kaya; Eser, Fatma; Hasanoglu, Imran; Guner, Rahmet",Med. mal. infect,,192
368123,COVID 19 accelerator of changes in the readiness of university teachers to use distant learning technologies,2021,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is spreading around the globe since December 2019. There is an urgent need to develop sensitive and online methods for on-site diagnosing and monitoring of suspected COVID-19 patients. With the huge development of Internet of Things (IoT), the impact of Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) provides an impressive solution to this problem. In this paper, we proposed a 5G-enabled fluorescence sensor for quantitative detection of spike protein and nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 by using mesoporous silica encapsulated up-conversion nanoparticles (UCNPs@mSiO2) labeled lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA). The sensor can detect spike protein (SP) with a detection of limit (LOD) 1.6 ng/mL and nucleocapsid protein (NP) with an LOD of 2.2 ng/mL. The feasibility of the sensor in clinical use was further demonstrated by utilizing virus culture as real clinical samples. Moreover, the proposed fluorescence sensor is IoMT enabled, which is accessible to edge hardware devices (personal computers, 5G smartphones, IPTV, etc.) through Bluetooth. Medical data can be transmitted to the fog layer of the network and 5G cloud server with ultra-low latency and high reliably for edge computing and big data analysis. Furthermore, a COVID-19 monitoring module working with the proposed the system is developed on a smartphone application (App), which endows patients and their families to record their medical data and daily conditions remotely, releasing the burdens of going to central hospitals. We believe that the proposed system will be highly practical in the future treatment and prevention of COVID-19 and other mass infectious diseases.","Guo, Jiuchuan; Chen, Shuqin; Tian, Shulin; Liu, Ke; Ni, Jian; Zhao, Ming; Kang, Yuejun; Ma, Xing; Guo, Jinhong",Biosens Bioelectron,,192

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the data of 425 patients who underwent lung resection for non-small cell lung cancer without preoperative radiation therapy between November 2012 and October 2017. The maximum SUV (SUVmax) in the IIP area except the lung cancer site was measured in each patient. RESULTS: Thirty-one of the 425 patients (7.3%) showed findings of IIP in chest CT. Five of the 31 patients (16.1%) developed acute exacerbation (AE) after lung resection (AE+ group). Twenty-six of the 31 patients (83.9%) did not develop AE (AE- group). In the AE+ group, 18F-FDG SUVmax in the IIP area was significantly higher (1.9 ± 0.6 vs. 2.7 ± 0.7, p = 0.02) compared with that in the AE- group. The receiver operating characteristic analysis identified an SUVmax threshold score of 2.55 (p = 0.02) for AE. There was no 90-day mortality in the patients with SUVmax < 2.55 (n = 25). On the other hand, the 90-day mortality rate in patients with SUVmax &#8805; 2.55 (n = 6) was 33.3% (2 patients). CONCLUSIONS: 18F-FDG PET/CT may predict AE after lung resection and could be related to short-term survival in lung cancer patients with IIP. Further investigations are needed to improve the prognosis in patients with high SUVmax in the IIP area.","Oishi, Hisashi; Sakurada, Akira; Notsuda, Hirotsugu; Tanaka, Ryota; Takanami, Kentaro; Saito, Ryoko; Eba, Shunsuke; Noda, Masafumi; Okada, Yoshinori",Respiratory investigation (Online),,192

The post-operative complication rate was similar when compared to the 836 subjects submitted to bariatric surgery the year before. Since the high prevalence of infection in subjects with BMI > 30, it was argued that early intervention on obesity during phase 2 could help to minimize the effects of the disease in the event of a possible reversion to a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak phase 1.

Levels of tumor necrosis factor &#945; (TNF-&#945;) and interleukin-1-beta (IL-1ß) were assessed using ELISA and compared between groups. Average TNF-&#945; levels were significantly increased in the olfactory epithelium of the COVID-19 group compared to the control group (P < 0.05). However, no differences in IL-1ß were seen between groups. Elevated levels of the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-&#945; were seen in the olfactory epithelium in patients with COVID-19. This suggests that direct inflammation of the olfactory epithelium could play a role in the acute olfactory loss described in many patients with COVID-19.","Torabi, Abolfazl; Mohammadbagheri, Esmaeil; Akbari Dilmaghani, Nader; Bayat, Amir-Hossein; Fathi, Mobina; Vakili, Kimia; Alizadeh, Rafieh; Rezaeimirghaed, Omidvar; Hajiesmaeili, Mohammadreza; Ramezani, Mahtab; Simani, Leila; Aliaghaei, Abbas",ACS Chem Neurosci,,192
372392,Comparison of natural and pharmacological hypothermia in animals: Determination of activation energy of metabolism,2020,"BACKGROUND: Exercise improves glycemic control and functional capacity in elderly people with diabetes; however, its effect on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and medical resource use remains unclear. This study aims to clarify the effect of exercise. METHODS: Using the data from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey between 2007 and 2016, we identified 1572 elderly people with diabetes for this cross-sectional population-based study. Demographic characteristics, health conditions, comorbidities, HRQoL, and medical resource were compared among four groups (no exercise, low-intensity exercise, moderate-intensity exercise, and high-intensity exercise). RESULTS: The mean age of all participants was between 71.5 and 73.3 years. Male participants with higher education performed more exercise than their counterparts. The moderate- and high-intensity groups reported better general health condition than the no exercise group. Depression and worse health were more common in the no exercise group. Participants in the moderate-intensity exercise group had lower risk for depression than those in the no exercise group (adjusted odds ratio: 0.13, 95% confidence interval: 0.02-0.92) after adjusting for demographic characteristics, health conditions, and comorbidities, whereas participants in the low- and high-intensity exercise did not have a lower risk. The no exercise group had the highest proportions of emergency, hospitalization, and total healthcare visits. CONCLUSIONS: Exercise is associated with better HRQoL, and lack of exercise is associated with higher medical resource use in elderly people with diabetes. Encouraging exercise is recommended in this population.","Huang, Chien-Cheng; Hsu, Chien-Chin; Chiu, Chong-Chi; Lin, Hung-Jung; Wang, Jhi-Joung; Weng, Shih-Feng",BMC Geriatr,,192

These concepts have been applied to Chinese reading research despite important differences across writing systems, with mixed results concerning their relative importance. The present study of covert naming in Chinese is distinctive in testing the ERP effects of regularity and consistency in a fully orthogonal design. We found that consistency, but not regularity, affected the N170, P200 and N400 as well as pronunciation transcription accuracies, demonstrating a more prominent role of consistency than regularity in character naming, consistent with conclusions from English word naming. To capture a generalization across writing systems, we propose mapping congruence as a writing-system-independent way of referring to orthography-to-phonology mappings and illustrate these congruence effects in an interactive framework of character identification.","Zhou, Lin; Perfetti, Charles",Brain Lang,,192

375481,"44th Annual Meeting of the American Society of Neuroimaging Virtual, January, 2021",2021,"OBJECTIVE: Diabetes is associated with progression to severe COVID-19. The objective of this study was to estimate to what extent the increased risk among people with diabetes could impact the secondary care costs of COVID-19 throughout Europe during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic from January to June 2020. METHODS: Applying a health care cost model based on inputs from data published in international peer-reviewed journals, identified via a rapid literature review this study aimed to estimate the total secondary sector costs of COVID-19. Estimates of unit costs were based on data from Denmark, France, Spain and the UK. We calculated average costs per patient without diabetes and according to four diabetes categories based on risk of hospitalisation, admission to intensive care unit, ventilator support and length of hospital stay. RESULTS: The estimated cost per hospital admission during the first wave of COVID-19 in Europe ranged between EUR 25,018 among people with type 2 diabetes in good glycaemic control to EUR 57,244 among people with type 1 diabetes in poor glycaemic control, reflecting higher risk of intensive care, ventilator support and longer hospital stay according to diabetes category, while the corresponding cost for people without diabetes was estimated at EUR 16,993. The total direct costs of secondary care of COVID-19 in Europe were estimated at EUR 13.9 billion. Thus, 23.5% of the total costs accounted for treating people with diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the importance of a greater focus on prevention and adequate treatment of diabetes and the need for special attention to avoid infection with COVID-19 to the extent possible among those already diagnosed with diabetes.","Bain, Stephen C; Czernichow, Sebastien; Bøgelund, Mette; Madsen, Maria Elmegaard; Yssing, Cecilie; McMillan, Annabell Cajus; Hvid, Christian; Hettiarachchige, Nadilka; Haagen Panton, Ulrik",Curr Med Res Opin,,192

One hundred and thirty-seven coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) samples from 96 reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction confirmed patients were chosen to perform the sensitivity analysis. Non-SARS-CoV-2 sera (n = 141) with a potential cross-reaction to SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays were included in the specificity analysis. None of these tests demonstrated a sufficiently high clinical sensitivity to diagnose acute infection. Fourteen days since symptom onset, we did not find any significant difference between the three techniques in terms of sensitivities. However, Elecsys performed better in terms of specificity. All three anti-SARS-CoV-2 assays had equivalent sensitivities 14 days from symptom onset to diagnose past-COVID-19 infection. We also confirmed that anti-SARS-CoV-2 determination before Day 14 is of less clinical interest.","Favresse, Julien; Cadrobbi, Julie; Eucher, Christine; Elsen, Marc; Laffineur, Kim; Dogné, Jean-Michel; Douxfils, Jonathan",J. med. virol,,192

Although the literature on COVID-19 is still limited, evidence demonstrates the need to reevaluate the use of effective nutritional support in this unprecedented, challenging clinical context. Supplemental parenteral nutrition must be considered due to the energy expenditure from COVID-19, the difficulty in achieving protein and energy goals in patients under enteral nutrition in prone position, and the worsened gastroparesis related to high doses of sedative/neuromuscular blocking agents.","Barbosa, C.

378090,MTC: Multiresolution Tensor Completion from Partial and Coarse Observations,2021-06-14,"BACKGROUND: Global randomised controlled trials of the anti-IL-6 receptor antibody tocilizumab in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 have shown conflicting results but potential decreases in time to discharge and burden on intensive care. Tocilizumab reduced progression to mechanical ventilation and death in a trial population enriched for racial and ethnic minorities. We aimed to investigate whether tocilizumab treatment could prevent COVID-19 progression in the first multicentre randomised controlled trial of tocilizumab done entirely in a lower-middle-income country. METHODS: COVINTOC is an open-label, multicentre, randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial done at 12 public and private hospitals across India. Adults (aged &#8805;18 years) admitted to hospital with moderate to severe COVID-19 (Indian Ministry of Health grading) confirmed by positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR result were randomly assigned (1:1 block randomisation) to receive tocilizumab 6 mg/kg plus standard care (the tocilizumab group) or standard care alone (the standard care group). The primary endpoint was progression of COVID-19 (from moderate to severe or from severe to death) up to day 14 in the modified intention-to-treat population of all participants who had at least one post-baseline assessment for the primary endpoint. Safety was assessed in all randomly assigned patients. The trial is completed and registered with the Clinical Trials Registry India (CTRI/2020/05/025369). FINDINGS: 180 patients were recruited between May 30, 2020, and Aug 31, 2020, and randomly assigned to the tocilizumab group (n=90) or the standard care group (n=90). One patient randomly assigned to the standard care group inadvertently received tocilizumab at baseline and was included in the tocilizumab group for all analyses. One patient randomly assigned to the standard care group withdrew consent after the baseline visit and did not receive any study medication and was not included in the modified intention-to-treat population but was still included in safety analyses. 75 (82%) of 91 in the tocilizumab group and 68 (76%) of 89 in the standard care group completed 28 days of follow-up. Progression of COVID-19 up to day 14 occurred in eight (9%) of 91 patients in the tocilizumab group and 11 (13%) of 88 in the standard care group (difference -3·71 [95% CI -18·23 to 11·19]; p=0·42). 33 (36%) of 91 patients in the tocilizumab group and 22 (25%) of 89 patients in the standard care group had adverse events; 18 (20%) and 15 (17%) had serious adverse events. The most common adverse event was acute respiratory distress syndrome, reported in seven (8%) patients in each group. Grade 3 adverse events were reported in two (2%) patients in the tocilizumab group and five (6%) patients in the standard care group. There were no grade 4 adverse events. Serious adverse events were reported in 18 (20%) patients in the tocilizumab group and 15 (17%) in the standard care group; 13 (14%) and 15 (17%) patients died during the study. INTERPRETATION: Routine use of tocilizumab in patients admitted to hospital with moderate to severe COVID-19 is not supported. However, post-hoc evidence from this study suggests tocilizumab might still be effective in patients with severe COVID-19 and so should be investigated further in future studies.

378213,Vaccines against Coronaviruses: The State of the Art,2020,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2, which is responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), uses angiotensin (ANG)-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the entrance receptor. Although most COVID-19 cases are mild, some are severe or critical, predominantly due to acute lung injury. It has been widely accepted that a counter regulatory renin-angiotensin system (RAS) axis including the ACE2/ANG [1-7]/Mas protects the lungs from acute lung injury. However, recent evidence suggests that the generation of protective ANG [1-7] in the lungs is predominantly mediated by proinflammatory prolyloligopeptidase (POP), which has been repeatedly demonstrated to be involved in lung pathology. This review contends that acute lung injury in severe COVID-19 is characterised by a) ACE2 downregulation and malfunction (inflammatory signalling) due to viral occupation, and b) dysregulation of the protective RAS axis, predominantly due to increased activity of proinflammatory POP. It follows that a reasonable treatment strategy in COVID-19-related acute lung injury would be delivering functional recombinant (r) ACE2 forms to trap the virus. Additionally, or alternatively to rACE2 delivery, the potential benefits resulting from lowering POP activity should also be explored. These treatment strategies deserve further investigation.","Triposkiadis, Filippos; Starling, Randall C; Xanthopoulos, Andrew; Butler, Javed; Boudoulas, Harisios",Heart lung circ,,192

380884,Protecting the lung from hypoxic stress,2021,"OBJECTIVE: Worry about COVID-19 is an important cognitive component and manifestation of COVID-19-related anxiety. It has a social dimension and is shaped by various social factors. DATA: We employ original data from a large survey (N = 20,632) conducted in China from April 21 to 23, 2020, which provide us with a rare opportunity to investigate COVID-19-induced worry among ordinary Chinese citizens. RESULTS: We find individuals' socioeconomic status, family characteristics, sense of community, and perceived strictness of lockdown measures all have significant influences on worry about COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: First, individuals with higher socioeconomic status such as better education, better income, and more prestigious occupations have richer resources in coping with COVID-19 and are thus less worried. Second, the high human-to-human transmissibility of COVID-19 and increased family obligations during the pandemic imply that larger family size can be a worry-inducing burden. Individuals living with larger families are more worried. Third, a greater sense of community lowers worry as it buffers against the stressor and may enhance individuals' faith in the community's efficacy in containing the virus. Last, stringent lockdown measures may actually have positive psychological effects. They provide real and perceived protection and increase individuals' perceived distance from the disease, thereby reducing public worry.","Zhou, Min; Guo, Wei",Soc Sci Med,,192

383191,Enhancing the fuel properties of beverage wastes as non-edible feedstock for biofuel production,2021,"BACKGROUND: The use of shared ventilation, or the simultaneous support of multiple patients connected in parallel to a single mechanical ventilator, is receiving considerable interest for addressing the severe shortage of mechanical ventilators available during the novel coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19). In this paper we highlight the potentially disastrous consequences of naïve shared ventilation, in which patients are simply connected in parallel to a ventilator without any regard to their individual ventilatory requirements. We then examine possible approaches for individualization of mechanical ventilation, using modifications to the breathing circuit that may enable tuning of individual tidal volumes and driving pressures during either volume-controlled ventilation (VCV) or pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV). METHODS: Breathing circuit modifications included a PEEP valve on each expiratory limb for both VCV and PCV, an adjustable constriction and one-way valve on the inspiratory limb for VCV, and a pressure-relief valve for peak inspiratory pressure reduction on the inspiratory limb for PCV. The ability to regulate individual tidal volumes using these breathing circuit modifications was tested both theoretically in computer simulations as well as experimentally in mechanical test lungs. RESULTS: In both the simulations and experimental measurements, naïve shared ventilation resulted in large imbalances across individual tidal volume delivery, dependent on imbalances across patient mechanical properties. The proposed breathing circuit modifications for shared VCV and shared PCV enabled optimization of tidal volume distributions. Individual tidal volume for one patient during shared VCV was sensitive to changes in the mechanical properties of other patients. By contrast, shared PCV enabled independent control of individual patient-received ventilation. CONCLUSIONS: Of the shared ventilation strategies considered, shared PCV, with the inclusion of in-line pressure-relief valves in the individual inspiratory and expiratory limbs, offers the greatest degree of safety and lowest risk of catastrophic mechanical interactions between multiple patients connected to a single ventilator.","Herrmann, Jacob; Fonseca da Cruz, Andrea; Hawley, Monica L; Branson, Richard D; Kaczka, David W",Respir Care,,192

With coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID)-19, as in a post-surgery situation, social isolation is being implemented. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study started on March 17, 2020, and ended on April 24, 2020. Consulting/phone interviews were made. The phone questionnaire, submitted to 71 patients, consisted of a set of 15 questions that investigated structure and psychological resistance. Eight patients have been monitored exclusively for the psychological aspect through a more articulate supporting path. RESULTS: In essence, from the overall analysis of the data derived from the study of the positioning of patients based on the stage of renal function, the bands related to the development of psychopathological aspects, and the use of positive personal resources, it emerges that patients in stage V kidney failure are in the first bracket as regards the development of psychopathological aspects (absence of these experiences) and in the third bracket as regards the good use of positive resources to deal with isolation. Therefore, it can be deduced that, although with data that can be expanded, a serious or medium-serious situation from an organic point of view in this socio-health emergency situation is well addressed by the transplanted patient. CONCLUSION: Transplant patients have faced the measure of social distancing adequately and in adherence to the treatment thanks to the phone assistance of all the medical-surgical and psychological team.","Lupi, Diana; Binda, Barbara; Montali, Filippo; Natili, Andrea; Lancione, Laura; Chiappori, Davide; Parzanese, Ida; Maccarone, Daniela; Pisani, Francesco",Transplant. proc,,192

These mental health issues confronting young people are of public concern. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the associations between loneliness and gaming addiction behaviors among young people in Hong Kong and to investigate how familial factors, psychological distress, and gender differences moderate these relationships. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted in June 2020 when schools reopened after 6 months of school closures. Participants included 2863 children and adolescents in primary (Grades 4 to 6) and secondary (Grades 7 and 8) schools (female participants: 1502/2863, 52.5%). Chi-square tests, one-way analyses of variance, and independent-samples t tests were performed to compare the differences of distribution in gaming addiction behaviors across gender, age, and other sociodemographic characteristics. Multinomial logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify factors that relate to excessive or pathological gaming behaviors separately, in comparison with leisure gaming. RESULTS: A total of 83.0% (2377/2863) of the participants played video games during the COVID-19 pandemic. The prevalence of excessive and pathological game addiction behaviors was 20.9% (597/2863) and 5.3% (153/2863), respectively. More male students had gaming addiction symptoms than female students. The multinomial logistic regressions showed that feeling lonely was associated with more problematic gaming behaviors, and the association was stronger for older female students. Low socioeconomic status, less parental support and less supervision, and poor mental health were risk factors for gaming addiction behaviors, especially among primary school students. CONCLUSIONS: Loneliness was associated with gaming addiction behaviors; the findings from this study suggested that this association was similar across gender and age groups among young people. Familial support and supervision during school closures can protect young people from developing problematic gaming behaviors. Results of this study have implications for prevention and early intervention on behalf of policy makers and game developers.","Zhu, Shimin; Zhuang, Yanqiong; Lee, Paul; Li, Jessica Chi-Mei; Wong, Paul W C",JMIR Serious Games,,192

Despite work highlighting the link between previous epidemics and elevated suicide rates, there is limited research on the relationship between the COVID-19 pandemic and suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Utilizing an online survey, the current study aimed to better understand the presence, and extent, of the association between COVID-19-related experiences and past-month suicidal thoughts and behaviors among adults in the United States recruited via Amazon Mechanical Turk (n = 907). Results support an association between several COVID-19-related experiences (i.e., general distress, fear of physical harm, effects of social distancing policies) and past-month suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. Further, a significant proportion of those with recent suicidal ideation explicitly link their suicidal thoughts to COVID-19. Exploratory analyses highlight a potential additional link between COVID-19 and suicidal behavior, suggesting that a portion of individuals may be intentionally exposing themselves to the virus with intent to kill themselves. These findings underscore the need for suicide risk screening and access to mental health services during the current pandemic. Particular attention should be paid to employing public health campaigns to disseminate information on such services to reduce the enormity of distress and emotional impairment associated with COVID-19 in the United States.","Ammerman, Brooke A; Burke, Taylor A; Jacobucci, Ross; McClure, Kenneth",J Psychiatr Res,,192

Vaccines and biologics are highly efficacious when administered properly. Sixteen rabies-related viruses (lyssaviruses) are similarly lethal, but some are divergent enough to evade protection from current vaccines and biologics, which are based only on the classical rabies virus (RABV). Here we present the development and characterization of LyssaVax, a vaccine featuring a structurally designed, functional chimeric glycoprotein (G) containing immunologically important domains from both RABV G and the highly divergent Mokola virus (MOKV) G. LyssaVax elicits high titers of antibodies specific to both RABV and MOKV Gs in mice. Immune sera also neutralize a range of wild-type lyssaviruses across the major phylogroups. LyssaVax-immunized mice are protected against challenge with recombinant RABV and MOKV.

To control emerging viruses, existing successful anti(retro)viral therapies can inspire antiviral strategies, as conserved viral enzymes (eg., viral proteases and RNA-dependent RNA polymerases) represent targets of choice. Since 2003, much effort has been expended in the characterization of the SARS-CoV replication/transcription machinery. Until recently, a pure and highly active preparation of SARS-CoV recombinant RNA synthesis machinery was not available, impeding target-based high throughput screening of drug candidates against this viral family. The current Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic revealed a new pathogen whose RNA synthesis machinery is highly (>96 % aa identity) homologous to SARS-CoV. This phylogenetic relatedness highlights the potential use of conserved replication enzymes to discover inhibitors against this significant pathogen, which in turn, contributes to scientific preparedness against emerging viruses. Here, we report the use of a purified and highly active SARS-CoV replication/transcription complex (RTC) to set-up a high-throughput screening of Coronavirus RNA synthesis inhibitors. The screening of a small (1520 compounds) chemical library of FDA-approved drugs demonstrates the robustness of our assay and will allow to speed-up drug discovery against the SARS-CoV-2.","Eydoux, Cecilia; Fattorini, Veronique; Shannon, Ashleigh; Le, Thi-Tuyet-Nhung; Didier, Bruno; Canard, Bruno; Guillemot, Jean-Claude",J Virol Methods,,192
389996,Beating back the coronavirus requires a bigger arsenal,2021,"BACKGROUND: Few case reports and clinical series exist on pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 who delivered. OBJECTIVE: To review the available information on mode of delivery, vertical/peripartum transmission, and neonatal outcome in pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2. SEARCH STRATEGY: Combination of the following key words: COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, and pregnancy in Embase and PubMed databases. SELECTION CRITERIA: Papers reporting cases of women infected with SARS-CoV-2 who delivered. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The following was extracted: author; country; number of women; study design; gestational age at delivery; selected clinical maternal data; mode of delivery; selected neonatal outcomes. MAIN RESULTS: In the 13 studies included, vaginal delivery was reported in 6 cases (9.4%; 95% CI, 3.5-19.3). Indication for cesarean delivery was worsening of maternal conditions in 31 cases (48.4%; 95% CI, 35.8-61.3). Two newborns testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time RT-PCR assay were reported. In three neonates, SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM levels were elevated but the RT-PCR test was negative. CONCLUSIONS: The rate of vertical or peripartum transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is low, if any, for cesarean delivery; no data are available for vaginal delivery. Low frequency of spontaneous preterm birth and general favorable immediate neonatal outcome are reassuring.","Parazzini, Fabio; Bortolus, Renata; Mauri, Paola Agnese; Favilli, Alessandro; Gerli, Sandro; Ferrazzi, Enrico",Int J Gynaecol Obstet,,192

Proprioception, Body Intelligence and Microsexual Conviviality",2020,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: During the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, a lockdown was imposed in Italy. The aim of this study was to investigate the perceptions, feelings and unmet needs of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients who experienced the 2-month lockdown in a ""red zone"" in the northern part of Italy during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: The study had a descriptive design that used a cross-sectional online survey which included open-ended questions to elicit responses on the participant's feelings concerning their risk of contracting coronavirus, how their physical activity had changed, and their personal needs, dictated by their condition, which were not met in this pandemic period as compared to previous periods. Demographic data were analysed using descriptive frequencies, while the open-ended questions were analysed using thematic framework analysis. RESULTS: The study included 103 participants (63 men/40 women [61.17 vs. 38.83%]). Framework analysis led to the identification of four main themes: (i) fearing the risk of contracting coronavirus; (ii) reduction of physical activity; (iii) perception of the risk of not being able to access outpatient clinics or support services; and (iv) negative experiences of the important reduction in socialization. The perceptions of unmet needs appeared to be greater than the actual experience, particularly for the reduction in physical activity and the interruption of contacts with the neurologist and other specialists. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights how perceptions and actual experience shape the meaning of living with PD during the pandemic. Worth noting is the divergence between perceptions and real impact in some aspects of the COVID-19 outbreak.","Cavallieri, Francesco; Sireci, Francesca; Fioravanti, Valentina; Toschi, Giulia; Rispoli, Vittorio; Antonelli, Francesca; Costantini, Massimo; Ghirotto, Luca; Valzania, Franco",Eur. j. neurol,,192

The aim of our study is to establish laboratory predictors of mortality in COVID-19 disease which can help to identify high risk patients. All patients admitted to hospital due to Covid-19 disease were included. Laboratory biomarkers that contributed with significant predictive value for predicting mortality to the clinical model were included. Cut-off points were established, and finally a risk score was built. 893 patients were included. Median age was 68.2 ± 15.2 years. 87(9.7%) were admitted to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and 72(8.1%) needed mechanical ventilation support. 171(19.1%) patients died. A Covid-19 Lab score ranging from 0 to 30 points was calculated on the basis of a multivariate logistic regression model in order to predict mortality with a weighted score that included haemoglobin, erythrocytes, leukocytes, neutrophils, lymphocytes, creatinine, C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, procalcitonin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and D-dimer. Three groups were established. Low mortality risk group under 12 points, 12 to 18 were included as moderate risk, and high risk group were those with 19 or more points. Low risk group as reference, moderate and high patients showed mortality OR 4.75(CI95% 2.60-8.68) and 23.86(CI 95% 13.61-41.84), respectively. C-statistic was 0-85(0.82-0.88) and Hosmer-Lemeshow p-value 0.63. Covid-19 Lab score can very easily predict mortality in patients at any moment during admission secondary to SARS-CoV2 infection. It is a simple and dynamic score, and it can be very easily replicated.

DESIGN: We employ a survey experiment in which treatment groups are exposed to key facts about the pandemic, followed by questions intended to elicit attitudes toward the incumbent party and government responsibility for the pandemic. SETTING: The survey was conducted amid the lockdown period of 15-26 April 2020 in three large democratic countries with the common governing language of English: India, the United Kingdom and the United States. Due to limitations on travel and recruitment, subjects were recruited through the M-Turk internet platform and the survey was administered entirely online. Respondents numbered 3648. RESULTS: Our expectation was that respondents in the treatment groups would favour, or disfavour, the incumbent and assign blame to government for the pandemic compared with the control group. We observe no such results. Several reasons may be adduced for this null finding. One reason could be that public health is not viewed as a political issue. However, people do think health is an important policy area (>85% agree) and that government has some responsibility for health (>90% agree). Another reason could be that people view public health policies through partisan lenses, which means that health is largely endogenous, and yet we find little evidence of polarisation in our data. Alternatively, it could be that the global nature of the pandemic inoculated politicians from blame and yet a majority of people do think the government is to blame for the spread of the pandemic (~50% agree). CONCLUSIONS: While we cannot precisely determine the mechanisms at work, the null findings contained in this study suggest that politicians are unlikely to be punished or rewarded for their failures or successes in managing COVID-19 in the next election. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Initial research hypotheses centred on expected variation between two treatments, as set forth in a detailed pre-analysis plan, registered at E-Gap: http://egap.org/registration/6645. Finding no difference between the treatments, we decided to focus this paper on the treatment/control comparison.

403110,[Special Session],2021,"Ganges River water quality was assessed to record the changes due to the nation-wide pandemic lockdown. Satellite-based (Sentinel-2) water quality analysis before and during lockdown was performed for seven selected locations spread across the entire stretch of the Ganges (Rishikesh-Dimond Harbour). Results revealed that due to the lockdown, the water quality of the Ganges improved with reference to specific water quality parameters, but the improvements were region specific. Along the entire stretch of Ganges, only the Haridwar site showed improvement to an extent of being potable as per the threshold set by the Central Pollution Control Board, New Delhi, India. A 55% decline in turbidity at that site during the lockdown was attributed to the abrupt halt in pilgrimage activities. Absorption by chromophoric dissolved organic matter which is an indicator of organic pollution declined all along the Ganges stretch with a maximum decline at the downstream location of Diamond Harbour. Restricted discharge of industrial effluent, urban pollution, sewage from hotels, lodges, and spiritual dwellings along the Ganges are some of the reasons behind such declines. No significant change in the geographic trend of chlorophyll-a was observed. The findings of this study highlight the importance of regular monitoring of the changes in the Ganges water quality using Sentinel-2 data to further isolate the anthropogenic impact, as India continues the phase-wise opening amidst the pandemic.","Muduli, P R; Kumar, A; Kanuri, V V; Mishra, D R; Acharya, P; Saha, R; Biswas, M K; Vidyarthi, A K; Sudhakar, A",Int J Environ Sci Technol (Tehran),,192

The role of nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) became of central importance. At the Robert Koch Institute, a multilayer strategy consisting of population-based and individual preventive measures to control the pandemic was developed, which built upon existing influenza pandemic plans as well as generic plans. This paper explains the recommended NPIs and illustrates the pharmaceutical approaches developed in parallel.Among others, general contact bans, providing material for infection prevention and control, ban of events, closing educational institutions, and restricting travel are counted among population-based measures. Additional individual preventive measures are necessary, e.g., keeping a minimum distance, reducing contacts, and wearing a mouth-nose covering as well as quarantine and isolation. Measures within the health system are based on recommendations of the Commission on Hospital Hygiene and Infection Protection (Kommission für Krankenhaushygiene und Infektionsprävention (KRINKO)) and specified and implemented by professional societies. Since November 2020, an antiviral therapy with remdesivir and treatment with the glucocorticoid dexamethasone have been available as pharmaceutical interventions. Monoclonal antibodies are at this time not approved.

Material and methods. The research was conducted as a part of an open, randomized, multicenter comparative study of the efficacy and safety of Areplivir, 200 mg film-coated tablets (""PROMOMED RUS"" LLC, Russia), in the patients hospitalized with COVID-19. The dosing regimen of Favipiravir was 1600 mg twice a day on the 1st day and 600 mg twice a day on days 2 14. Thirty nine patients were enrolled into the study with a laboratory-established diagnosis of a new type of Coronavirus infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 (confirmed) of moderate severity, with pneumonia. The group of comparison (22 patients) received standard etiotropic therapy, prescribed in accordance with the current version of the temporary guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19, represented mainly by Hydroxychloroquine with the dosage regimen of 800 mg on the 1st day, then 400 mg on days 2-7, and Azithromycin 500 mg once a day for 5 days. The main group (17 patients) received Favipiravir (Areplivir) as etiotropic therapy. Results. In the main group, the time period until fever disappeared was found to be 1.36 days shorter than in the group of comparison (p0.05);there was a higher rate of the reduction of inflammatory changes in the lungs according to the computer tomography data (38.4% vs 14.9%, p0.05). By the end of the treatment, there was also a lower lactate level in the blood (27.1%, p0.05) than in the patients of the group of comparison. The evaluation of the drug efficacy according to the Categorical Ordinal Scale of Clinical Improvement and measurements of oxygen saturation in the blood, manifested similar positive dynamics in the patients treated according to various etiotropic therapy regimens. By the end of the treatment, the RNA SARS-CoV-2 tests were also negative in all the patients. As for the overall frequency of adverse events (AEs), no relevant distinctions were found between the groups. A greater part of AEs was related to hepatotoxicity, with a predominantly clinically relevant increase in alanine aminotransferase (ALT). A clinically relevant prolongation of the corrected QT interval on the standard ECG was found to occur in the standard-Therapy group on day 5, while no serious AEs were registered in the main group. No serious adverse reactions were registered in patients of the main group. Conclusion. The efficacy of the Favipiravir (Areplivir) therapy for the novel coronavirus infection has proved to be superior to the efficacy of the standard etiotropic therapy in a number of aspects. Basing on the obtained findings, Favipiravir (Areplivir) drug can be recommended for treating patients with the novel coronavirus infection of moderate severity. © 2021 Volgograd State Medical University, Pyatigorsk Medical and Pharmaceutical Institute.

METHODS: This observational cohort study has been designed as a quality of care registry and is executed by the Dutch Oncology COVID-19 Consortium (DOCC), a nationwide collaboration of oncology physicians in the Netherlands. A questionnaire has been developed to collect pseudonymised patient data on patients' characteristics, cancer diagnosis and treatment. All patients with COVID-19 and a cancer diagnosis or treatment in the past 5 years are eligible. RESULTS: Between March 27th and May 4th, 442 patients were registered. For this first analysis, 351 patients were included of whom 114 patients died. In multivariable analyses, age &#8805;65 years (p < 0.001), male gender (p = 0.035), prior or other malignancy (p = 0.045) and active diagnosis of haematological malignancy (p = 0.046) or lung cancer (p = 0.003) were independent risk factors for a fatal outcome of COVID-19. In a subgroup analysis of patients with active malignancy, the risk for a fatal outcome was mainly determined by tumour type (haematological malignancy or lung cancer) and age (&#8805;65 years). CONCLUSION: The findings in this registry indicate that patients with a haematological malignancy or lung cancer have an increased risk of a worse outcome of COVID-19. During the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, these vulnerable patients should avoid exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, whereas treatment adjustments and prioritising vaccination, when available, should also be considered.","de Joode, Karlijn; Dumoulin, Daphne W; Tol, Jolien; Westgeest, Hans M; Beerepoot, Laurens V; van den Berkmortel, Franchette W P J; Mutsaers, Pim G N J; van Diemen, Nico G J; Visser, Otto J; Oomen-de Hoop, Esther; Bloemendal, Haiko J; van Laarhoven, Hanneke W M; Hendriks, Lizza E L; Haanen, John B A G; de Vries, Elisabeth G E; Dingemans, Anne-Marie C; van der Veldt, Astrid A M",Eur J Cancer,,192

A reply to Pawson’s ‘boxed in by models’,2021,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, educational institutions were shut down all over the world, which impacted over 60% of students and caused a massive disruption of the education system. The goal of this paper was to identify the critical success factors for E-learning during COVID-19 using the multi-criteria Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) techniques to enhance the educational process. Data were generated by interviewing 69 E-learning managers in educational institutions during COVID-19 based on defined evaluation criteria and E-learning approaches through several channels. We found that technology management, support from management, increased student awareness to use E-learning systems, and demanding a high level of information technology from instructors, students, and universities were the most influential factors for E-learning during COVID-19. Among the five learning systems, blended learning was the most suitable learning system to practice. These results demonstrated that, regardless of how extraordinary the technology is in an educational institution, the readiness of E-learning execution played a large role in boosting the educational process during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Alqahtani, Ammar Y.; Rajkhan, Albraa A.",Educ.

While there is limited evidence concerning their curative or preventive role against SARS-CoV-2 infection, previous work on their utility against influenza and recent post-hoc analysis of the Edinburgh and Lothians Viral Intervention Study (ELVIS) provide compelling support to their applicability in the current crisis. Saline water gargling and nasal irrigation represent simple, economical, practically feasible, and globally implementable strategies with therapeutic and prophylactic value. These methods, rooted in the traditional Indian healthcare system, are suitable and reliable in terms of infection control and are relevant examples of harmless interventions.

The present paper aims at analysing the impact of suspicious of SARS-COV-2 infection in a cohort of parents presented at 3 major hospitals (spread between north and center of Italy) during the Italian COVID-19 pandemic phase 1. METHODS: Participants of the present cross-sectional, multicenter study were parental couples of children suspected to have COVID-19 who underwent testing with nasopharyngeal swabbing. All subjects were assessed by means of the: Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) in order to evaluate Post-traumatic stress (PTSS), anxiety, and depressive symptoms, respectively. OUTCOMES: Results evidenced that parents whose children tested positive for COVID-19 were more prone to developing PTSS, anxiety and depressive symptoms. The same results emerged for parents who had quarantined as opposed to those who had not. Moreover, patients who suffered economic damage showed a higher prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms, whereas PTSS was more common among unemployed subjects and among mothers. INTERPRETATION: This study identified a mental health strain represented by parenting a child who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further EB research is needed to develop evidence-driven strategies to reduce adverse psychological impacts and related psychiatric symptoms in caregivers of COVID-19 infected children during the next phases of the pandemic.","Orsini, A; Corsi, M; Pedrinelli, V; Santangelo, A; Bertelloni, C; Dell039,; Oste, V; Cordelli, D; Perrone, A; Parini, L; Lanari, M; Massimetti, G; Bonuccelli, A; Foiadelli, T; Trabatti, C; Savasta, S; Marseglia, G; Striano, P; Peroni, D G; Osso, L; Carmassi, C",J Psychiatr Res,,192
408071,"Photocatalytic CO2 Reductions Catalyzed by meso-(1,10-Phenanthrolin-2-yl)-Porphyrins having a Rhenium(I) Tricarbonyl Complex",2020,"INTRODUCTION: An amphibious assault ship was deployed on 22 March in Corsica to carry out medical evacuation of 12 critical patients infected with COVID-19. The ship has on-board hospital capacity and is the first time that an amphibious assault ship is engaged in this particular condition. The aim is to evaluate the feasibility and safety of prolonged medical evacuation of critical patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We included 12 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection: six ventilated patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome and six non-ventilated patients with hypoxaemia. Transfer on an amphibious assault ship lasted 20 hours. We collected patients' medical records: age, comorbidities, COVID-19 history and diagnosis, ventilation supply and ventilator settings, and blood gas results. We calculated oxygen consumption (OC). RESULTS: All patients had a medical history. The median delay from onset of symptoms to hospitalisation was 8 (7-10) days. The median Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score on admission was 3 (2-5). There was no significant increase in oxygen during ship transport and no major respiratory complication. There was no significant increase in arterial oxygen pressure to fractional inspired oxygen ratio among ventilated patients during ship transport. Among ventilated patients, the median calculated OC was 255 L (222-281) by hours and 5270 L (4908-5616) during all ship transport. Among non-ventilated patients, the median calculated OC was 120 L (120-480) by hours and 2400 L (2400-9600) during all ship transport. CONCLUSION: The present work contributes to assessing the feasibility and safety condition of critical COVID-19 evacuation on an amphibious assault ship during an extended transport. The ship needs to prepare a plan and a specialised intensive team and conduct patient screening for prolonged interhospital transfers.","Nguyen, Cédric; Montcriol, A; Janvier, F; Cungi, P-J; Esnault, P; Mathais, Q; Vallet, C; Boussen, S; Cordier, P-Y; Serpin, L; Papazian, L; Bordes, J",,,192

Presently, we constructed and analyzed the phylo-geo-network of SARS-CoV-2 genomes from across India to understand the viral evolution in the country. A total of 611 full-length genomes from different states of India were extracted from the EpiCov repository of GISAID initiative on 6 June, 2020. Their alignment with the reference sequence (Wuhan, NCBI accession number NC_045512.2) uncovered 270 parsimony informative sites. Furthermore, 339 genomes were divided into 51 haplogroups. The network revealed the core haplogroup as that of reference sequence NC_045512.2 (Haplogroup A1) with 157 identical sequences present across 16 states. Remaining haplogroups had <10 identical sequences across a maximum of three states. Some states with fewer samples had more haplogroups. Forty-one haplogroups were localized exclusively to any one state. The two most common lineages are B6 and B1 (Pangolin) whereas clade A2a (Covidex) appears to be the most predominant in India.

This phenomenon, termed COVID-19-associated coagulopathy, is now considered a major component of the pathophysiology of this novel infectious disease, leading to widespread thrombosis. While at first, the vascular insults may be limited to the pulmonary microvasculature, as the disease progresses, systemic involvement occurs, culminating in distant organ thrombosis and multiorgan dysfunction syndrome. In this review article, we discuss recent insights into the pathophysiologic mechanisms of COVID-19-associated coagulopathy and review the clinical, histopathologic, and laboratory evidence, which leads us to conclude that COVID-19 is both a pulmonary and vascular disorder.","Lippi, Giuseppe; Sanchis-Gomar, Fabian; Favaloro, Emmanuel J; Lavie, Carl J; Henry, Brandon M",Mayo Clin Proc,,192
412821,"Response to Tang, et al",2020,"Known laparoscopic and robotic assisted approaches and techniques for the surgical management of urological malignant and benign diseases are commonly used around the World. During the global pandemic COVID19, urology surgeons had to reorganize their daily surgical practice. A concern with the use of minimally invasive techniques arose due to a proposed risk of viral transmission of the coronavirus disease with the creation of pneumoperitoneum. Due to this, we reviewed the literature to evaluate the use of laparoscopy and robotics during the pandemic COVID19. A literature review of viral transmission in surgery and of the available literature regarding the transmission of the COVID19 virus was performed up to April 30, 2020. We additionally reviewed surgical society guidelines and recommendations regarding surgery during this pandemic. Few studies have been performed on viral transmission during surgery. No study has been made regarding this area during minimally invasive urology cases. To date there is no study that demonstrates or can suggest the ability for a virus to be transmitted during surgical treatment whether open, laparoscopic or robotic. There is no society consensus on restricting laparoscopic or robotic surgery. However, there is expert consensus on modification of standard practices to minimize any risk of transmission. During the pandemic COVID19 we recommend the use of specific personal protective equipment for the surgeon, anesthesiologist and nursing staff in the operating room. Modifications of standard practices during minimally invasive surgery such as using lowest intra-abdominal pressures possible, controlled smoke evacuation systems, and minimizing energy device usage are recommended.","Zampolli, Hamilton C; Rodriguez, Alejandro R",Int Braz J Urol,,192

OBJECTIVE: To characterize mucocutaneous disease and its relation to clinical course among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and MIS-C. METHODS: Descriptive cohort study of prospectively and consecutively hospitalized eligible patients between May 11, 2020 and June 5, 2020. RESULTS: In COVID-19 patients, 4 of 12 (33%) had rash and/or mucositis, including erythema, morbilliform pattern, and lip mucositis. In MIS-C patients, 9 of 19 (47%) had rash and/or mucositis, including erythema, morbilliform, retiform purpura, targetoid and urticarial patterns, along with acral edema, lip mucositis, tongue papillitis, and conjunctivitis. COVID-19 patients with rash had less frequent respiratory symptoms, pediatric intensive care unit admission, invasive ventilation, and shorter stay versus COVID-19 patients without rash. MIS-C patients with rash had less frequent pediatric intensive care unit admission, shock, ventilation, as well as lower levels of C-reactive protein, ferritin, D-dimer, and troponin (vs MIS-C without rash).

The objective of this study was to analyse the efficacy of telemedicine (by telephone) in monitoring patients in a coloproctology unit, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: Prospective descriptive study of consecutive patients in a single centre. The result of the teleconsultation was classified as discharge, resolved visit or reprogramming and was analysed by different diagnostic groups. RESULTS: From March 19th to April 17th, 2020, the teleconsultation of 190 patients was carried out. The response rate was 94.2% (179). The diagnostic categories of the patients attended were: 51 (26.9%) colorectal neoplasia, 48 (25.3%) proctological pathology, 72 (37.9%) pelvic floor dysfunctions and 19 (10%) other benign pathologies. 105 (55.26%) could be recited as if they had come in person. Eleven (5.8%) patients were discharged. No significant differences were found between the different diagnostic categories and the resolution of the teleconsultation.

417090,Biosafety materials: an emerging new research direction of materials science from the COVID-19 outbreak,2020,"Type I interferons (IFN-I) are a major antiviral defense and are critical for the activation of the adaptive immune system. However, early viral clearance by IFN-I could limit antigen availability, which could in turn impinge upon the priming of the adaptive immune system. In this study, we hypothesized that transient IFN-I blockade could increase antigen presentation after acute viral infection. To test this hypothesis, we infected mice with viruses coadministered with a single dose of IFN-I receptor-blocking antibody to induce a short-term blockade of the IFN-I pathway. This resulted in a transient ""spike"" in antigen levels, followed by rapid antigen clearance. Interestingly, short-term IFN-I blockade after coronavirus, flavivirus, rhabdovirus, or arenavirus infection induced a long-lasting enhancement of immunological memory that conferred improved protection upon subsequent reinfections. Short-term IFN-I blockade also improved the efficacy of viral vaccines. These findings demonstrate a novel mechanism by which IFN-I regulate immunological memory and provide insights for rational vaccine design.","Palacio, Nicole; Dangi, Tanushree; Chung, Young Rock; Wang, Yidan; Loredo-Varela, Juan Luis; Zhang, Zhongyao; Penaloza-MacMaster, Pablo",J. exp. med,,192

It was first reported in the Wuhan city, a huge metropolis of 11 million people in central China. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic. The virus became named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2), which was nomenclature by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. Coronavirus is polymorphic spherical particles with spike like surface projections. The envelope of coronavirus consists of a lipid bilayer, where the four membrane protein is anchored i.e. S – spike, E – envelope, M – membrane, N – nucleocapsid. Inside envelop the N protein bound to the positive sense single stranded RNA (+ssRNA) genome. The size of the ssRNA genome is ̴30000 nucleotide long. The coronavirus probably originated in bats, although it was not clear that how it was transmitted from bats to humans. In keeping with current evidence, coronavirus is transmitted between people through respiratory droplets and close contacts. RT-PCR is the most unique and sensitive for the detection of coronavirus and it is more beneficial for detecting the virus in the primary phase of the infection. It has been observed that there is no vaccine available for the treatment of coronavirus till now, but the S protein is presently considered to be one of the maximum promising targets for coronavirus vaccine development. Here, we review that the biology of the coronavirus in the term of an epidemiology, multiplication, diagnosis, transmission, prevention, treatment.","Kumar, Amit; Goswami, Aakansha; Verma, Vikrant",Int.

429326,Artificial Intelligence in Corporate Governance,2021,"Telemedicine refers to the delivery of medical care and provision of general health services from a distance. Telemedicine has been practiced for decades with increasing evidence proving its potential for enhanced quality of care for patients, reduction in hospital readmissions, and increase in savings for both patients and providers. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a significant increase in the reliance on telemedicine and telehealth for provision of health care services. Developments in telemedicine should be structured as complements to current health care procedures, not with the goal of completely digitizing the entire health care system, but rather to use the power of technology to enhance areas that may not be working at their full potential. At the same time, it is also clear that further research is needed on the effectiveness of telemedicine in terms of both financial and patient benefits. We discuss the current and rapidly increasing knowledge about the use of telemedicine in the United States, and identify the gaps in knowledge and opportunities for further research. Beginning with telemedicine's origins in the United States to its widespread use during the COVID-19 pandemic, we highlight recent developments in legislation, accessibility, and acceptance of telemedicine.","Hyder, Maryam A; Razzak, Junaid",J Med Internet Res,,192
429406,Emulating Human Tissues and Organs: A Bioprinting Perspective Toward Personalized Medicine,2020,"BACKGROUND: Poor emotion regulation is associated with post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). However, limited prospective research prevents any directional conclusions. No known studies have assessed emotion regulation with PTSS in American Indians, a high-risk population for poor mental health outcomes. The present prospective study explored whether emotion regulation strategies (cognitive reappraisal, expressive suppression) predicted later PTSS related to the COVID-19 global pandemic in a solely American Indian sample. METHODS: American Indian participants (N = 210; Mean (SD) age = 54.85(13.08) years, 58.7% female) completed the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ) during Phase 1 (a few weeks before pandemic declaration) and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) with respect to the COVID-19 pandemic during Phase 2 (7-8 weeks after pandemic declaration). Bivariate correlations and hierarchical linear regression analyses were utilized. RESULTS: ERQ reappraisal was negatively associated with IES-R total scores, such that higher reappraisal predicted lower PTSS. In contrast, ERQ suppression was positively associated with IES-R total scores, such that higher suppression predicted higher PTSS. CONCLUSIONS: Greater suppression and lower reappraisal predicts PTSS in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in an entirely American Indian sample, providing critical information for future interventions in a population at high-risk for mental health disparities.","Tyra, Alexandra T; Ginty, Annie T; John-Henderson, Neha A",Int. j. behav. med,,192
430055,The future of departments of animal sciences in Argentina,2020,"Context: An enhanced role for work-based learning is advocated increasingly widely across industrialised countries and by international Vocational Education and Training (VET) policies However, this is framed differently in each country by long-term policy orientations that reflect VET’s relationship with wider economic and social formations These national differences reflect path dependency but also distinctive responses to contemporary challenges such as globalisation In England, recent reforms strengthening workplace learning are constrained by existing patterns of skill formation and may be shaped by further market liberalisation and divergence from social and economic policies in Europe Approach: The study examined the relationship between greater emphasis on workplace learning in England and societal change, addressing the research question: how are early experiences of work in England, as part of young people’s full-time education programmes, positioning them for future employment? Case studies were organised around apparently distinctive placement types that had emerged from earlier studies Using the constant comparative method, the team identified a series of categories to distinguish the way each type of work-based learning positioned students in a particular type of labour market transition Findings: Evidence emerged of divergence in England’s ""further education"" system, across mainly male ""technical"" routes, young people on vocational courses preparing them for routine, low-skilled, precarious employment, and an area of greater uncertainty preparing young people for digital routes linked to the ""new economy"" Key dimensions of difference included study locations, discourses of occupational status, types of valued learning content, approaches to socialisation, sources of expertise and processes of credentialisation In each case, learning at work served to position students for a particular type of labour market transition, which we characterise as technical elite formation, welfare VET and new economy precarity Conclusion: Approaches to workplace learning in England already reflect social distinctions but entail the possibility of reinforcing these, supporting a more hierarchical pattern of labour market transition Whilst the upper strata of VET shift their purpose to support the formation of new ""technical elites"", others face the possibility of further marginalisation Such new inequalities could become central to a further fragmented society in a post-Brexit, post-COVID-19 Britain Other European states facing challenges of globalisation and the transition to services are also likely to experience pressures for VET stratification, although they may seek less divisive solutions © 2020 European Research Network Vocational Education and Training All rights reserved","Esmond, B.; Atkins, L.",International Journal for Research in Vocational Education and Training,,192

In particular, we focus on the missed revenue from gate receipts for the Big Four leagues. Design/methodology/approach: The authors forecast the 2020 revenue for each of the four major leagues under two scenarios: (1) expected revenue under the normal conditions of fans in attendance and (2) expected revenues in the absence of fans due to the countermeasures in place. Then, the authors calculate the loss in gate receipts as a difference in the revenue under fans and no-fans scenarios. Findings: Based on the current estimates, the combined financial loss of the clubs from NFL, MLB, NBA and NHL is expected to be above 6.8bn dollars in gate receipts alone. Practical implications: The findings are useful to the league management to prepare for the suboptimal financial situation.

431294,The ELFIN Mission,2020,"Background: Demand for virtual visits (an online synchronous medical appointment between a health care provider and patient) is increasing due to the COVID-19 pandemic. There may be additional benefits of virtual visits as they appear to be convenient and potentially cost-saving to patients. People receiving maintenance hemodialysis require ongoing care from their nephrologist and may benefit from virtual visits;however, the optimal model for a virtual kidney clinic is unknown. Objective: To codesign and assess the feasibility of a virtual (video) kidney clinic model with clinic staff, nephrologists, and patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis, to be used for routine follow-up visits. Design: Mixed-methods study. Setting: Two main kidney clinics in central Calgary, Alberta. Participants: Adults with kidney failure receiving maintenance hemodialysis, nephrologists, and clinic staff. Methods: First, we individually interviewed clinic staff and nephrologists to assess the needs of the clinic to deliver virtual visits. Then, we used participant observation with patients and nephrologists to codesign the virtual visit model. Finally, we used structured surveys to evaluate the patients’ and nephrologists’ experiences when using the virtual model. Results: Eight video visits (8 patients;6 nephrologists) were scheduled between October 2019 and February 2020 and 7 were successfully completed. Among completed visits, all participants reported high satisfaction with the service, were willing to use it again, and would recommend it to others. Three main themes were identified with respect to factors influencing visit success: IT infrastructure, administration, and process. Limitations: Patients received training on how to use the videoconference platform by the PhD student, whom also set up the technical components of the visit for the nephrologist. This may have overestimated the feasibility of virtual visits if this level of support is not available in future. Second, interviews were not audio-recorded and thematic analysis relied on field notes. Conclusions: Video visits for routine follow-up care between people receiving hemodialysis and nephrologists were acceptable to patients and nephrologists. Video visits appear to be feasible if clinics are equipped with appropriate equipment and IT infrastructure, physicians are remunerated appropriately, and patients receive training on how to use software as needed. © The Author(s) 2021.","Lunney, M.; Thomas, C.; Rabi, D.; Bello, A.

Almost overnight, practitioners were forced to transfer their face-to-face care practice to online means. To understand the implications of this drastic change for mental health care, and to improve the online care offerings, an online qualitative survey was held among mental health care professionals in Netherlands (n = 51). Our findings indicate that technological and usability problems pose a significant challenge, as do difficulties to establish rapport with clients. Moreover, not all mental health issues and treatment forms are equally amenable to online interaction. In contrast, in many instances, practitioners were positive about the effectiveness of treatment, and reported flexibility, a lower threshold for contact, and lack of travel time as advantages. Their most prominent needs concern better technological, organizational, and logistical support. It is critical that these needs are acted upon by institutions and governments.

However, one of the few to make such a fast jump in a powerful evolutionary shortcut. The incredible pattern of aggressiveness worldwide since the beginning of the outbreak is that up to 20% of those infected need hospitalization and 5% evolve to critical conditions, not limited to respiratory-related issues, but rather to systemic involvement. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to summarize the current knowledge about the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the male genitourinary tract. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A narrative review was carried out to identify articles on the SARS-CoV-2 infection on the male genitourinary system. RESULTS: Considerations were made about the molecular characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and immune response to coronavirus. We discussed the influence of the virus on the urinary system, potential mechanisms of COVID-19- related acute kidney injury (AKI), and the role of cytokine release syndrome on the renal pathophysiology of the disease. In the male reproductive tract, it was discussed the testis' vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2 invasion and the possible adverse effects on its function and the seminal findings of COVID-19.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the results of a triangulation of an end-to-end anastomosis using oral mucosa for urethral reconstruction. METHODS: Twelve healthy dogs of no defined race weighing between 13 and 17 kg were anesthetized and an urethral catheter was maintained during the whole surgery. First, a piece of oral mucosa was removed from the superior lip and kept in saline solution containing aqueous chloramphenicol. Then, a 2 cm fragment of the urethra from the penis was removed and the oral mucosa was used to reconstruct the urethra. RESULTS: After 60 days we observed stenosis in 25% of the dogs. There were also urethral-cutaneous fistulas and constrast leakage at the site of anastomosis. CONCLUSION: The triangulation of an end-to-end anastomosis using oral mucosa for urethral reconstruction does not prevent the occurrence of stenosis.","Ferro da Silva, Fernando; Margarida Paulo, Neusa; Alves de Brito, George; Fernanda Guimarães Vaz, Karla; de Sousa Freitas, José; Moraes Porto, Simone; Braga Siqueira Rôlla, Adriana; Schneider da Silva, Luciano",Acta cir. bras.,,192

442040,Large deviations of Schramm-Loewner evolutions: A survey,2021-02-13,"We introduce a method for making short-term mortality forecasts of a few months, illustrating it by estimating how many deaths might have happened if some major shock had not occurred. We apply the method to assess excess mortality from March to June 2020 in Denmark and Sweden as a result of the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic; associated policy interventions; and behavioral, healthcare, social, and economic changes. We chose to compare Denmark and Sweden because reliable data were available and because the two countries are similar but chose different responses to COVID-19: Denmark imposed a rather severe lockdown; Sweden did not. We make forecasts by age and sex to predict expected deaths if COVID-19 had not struck. Subtracting these forecasts from observed deaths gives the excess death count. Excess deaths were lower in Denmark than Sweden during the first wave of the pandemic. The later/earlier ratio we propose for shortcasting is easy to understand, requires less data than more elaborate approaches, and may be useful in many countries in making both predictions about the future and the past to study the impact on mortality of coronavirus and other epidemics. In the application to Denmark and Sweden, prediction intervals are narrower and bias is less than when forecasts are based on averages of the last 5 y, as is often done. More generally, later/earlier ratios may prove useful in short-term forecasting of illnesses and births as well as economic and other activity that varies seasonally or periodically.","Rizzi, Silvia; Vaupel, James W",Proc.

Despite its recognized value and availability, telemedicine is not universally used, suggesting that some barriers prevent its adoption and acceptance within the community. This study aims to describe the implementation of a low-cost telemedicine service in a pediatric hospital in Brazil. METHOD: Retrospective descriptive study reporting the first three months (April to June 2020) of the experience of implementing a low-cost telemedicine emergency care program in a public tertiary hospital. The service was available to patients up to 18 years of age enrolled in this hospital. A tool for assessing the severity of the patient was developed, the aim of standardizing the procedure, while maintaining quality and safety. Guardian's satisfaction was assessed with a questionnaire sent after teleconsultations. RESULTS: 255 teleconsultations were carried out with 140 different patients. Of the total consultations, 182 were from 99 patients that had performed the Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test for the new coronavirus (SARS-Cov-2) or had direct contact with a person known to be positive for COVID-19. Only 26 (14%) were referred to an in-person consultation. No deaths, adverse events or delayed diagnosis were recorded. 86% of the patients who answered the satisfaction questionnaire were satisfied and 92% would use telemedicine again. CONCLUSION: This study presents an innovative implementation of a telemedicine program in a public and exclusively pediatric tertiary service, serving as a reference for future implementation in other public services in Brazil and developing countries.","Severini, Rafael da Silva Giannasi; Oliveira, Pedro Carpini de; Couto, Thomaz Bittencourt; Simon Junior, Hany; Andrade, Anarella Penha Meirelles de; Nanbu, Danilo Yamamoto; Farhat, Sylvia C L; Schvartsman, Cláudio",,,192

443549,Causal Discovery using Compression-Complexity Measures,2020-10-19,"Framework: Healthcare project finance (PF) involves long-term structural investments in hospitals, typically within a public–private partnership (PPP). Banks represent the third major stakeholder, supporting the private player. Within this well-known framework, digital platforms represent a new virtual stakeholder, operating as a bridging node that incorporates information, and eases transactions. The relationships among the stakeholders are re-engineered around the platform and may be expressed with network theory patterns, even considering its multilayer extensions. Justification: As these investments are highly leveraged, especially during the construction phase, bankability represents a major sustainability concern. Objective: The research question is focused on the savings deriving from the introduction of networked digital platforms, and on their impact on bankability, shaping a new PPP model. Methodology: The study is conducted through (a) an economic–financial sensitivity analysis where digital savings impact on key PF parameters, including bankability;(b) a mathematical interpretation, based on network theory, where the stakeholders of two ecosystems—respectively, without and with a digital platform—are compared. Results: The creation of a value-adding “pie” anticipates its partitioning among the value co-creating stakeholders. This study represents an advance in the field, showing how technological innovation may improve the overall bankability and the value creation of leveraged infrastructural investments, even beyond the healthcare industry.","Moro-Visconti, Roberto",Sustainability,,192

There are gonochoric, hermaphroditic, and parthenogenetic species among them. The main aim of this study was to analyze the structure of the ovary, the structure of female germ cell clusters, and the course of oogenesis in the parthenogenetic species Hypsibius exemplaris, which in 2007 was recognized as a model organism. The material was analyzed using light and confocal microscopy as well as transmission and scanning electron microscopy. Histochemical and immunohistochemical methods were used. Our study showed that in the meroistic-polytrophic ovary of the examined species, branched germ cell clusters are formed in which one cell differentiates into an oocyte while the remaining cells become trophocytes. Vitellogenesis is of the mixed type: the first part of the yolk is synthesized by the oocyte (autosynthesis); the second part is synthesized by trophocytes and transported to the oocyte by cytoplasmic bridges; and the third part is synthesized outside the ovary (in storage cells) and transported to the oocyte by endocytosis. At the end of oogenesis, the trophocytes die by apoptosis. Parthenogenetic female of H. exemplaris lays from one to a dozen smooth eggs into exuviae.","Jezierska, Marta; Miernik, Aleksandra; Sojka, Julia; Student, Sebastian; Sliwinska, Malgorzata A; Gross, Vladimir; Poprawa, Izabela",Micron,,192

There has been growing interest regarding the harmful effects of COVID-19 on the cardiovascular system. This systematic review aims to systematically analyze papers reporting echocardiographic findings in hospitalized COVID-19 subjects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We included prospective and retrospective studies reporting echocardiography data in >10 hospitalized adult subjects with COVID-19; from 1st February 2020 to 15th January 2021. RESULTS: The primary electronic search identified 1120 articles. Twenty-nine studies were finally included, enrolling 3944 subjects. Overall the studies included a median of 68.0% (45.5-100.0) of patients admitted to ICU. Ten studies (34.4%) were retrospective, and 20 (68.9%) single-centred. Overall enrolling 1367 subjects, three studies reported normal echocardiographic findings in 49 ± 18% of cases. Seven studies (24.1%) analyzed the association between echocardiographic findings and mortality, mostly related to right ventricular (RV) dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: Data regarding the use of echocardiography on hospitalized, predominantly ICU, COVID-19 patients were retrieved from studies with heterogeneous designs, variable sample sizes, and severity scores. Normal echocardiographic findings were reported in about 50% of subjects, with LVEF usually not affected. Overall, RV dysfunction seems more likely associated with increased mortality.

447776,Coronavirus Perceptions And Economic Anxiety,2020-03-08,"INTRODUCTION: A significant increase in growth velocity is observed during recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) therapy in patients with growth hormone deficiency (GHD), especially just after the beginning of treatment. This phenomenon is referred to as catch-up growth"". After some time, the growth velocity decreases to the physiological value, i.e. the value that is observed in healthy children. The treatment is continued until the time of the growth process is completed. The continuity of the therapy makes it impossible to assess whether the catch-up phenomenon occurs only at the beginning of the treatment or may be observed after treatment cessation and its re-introduction. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Growth velocity was evaluated in a group of 35 patients with GHD after repeated therapy application, in which, due to non-medical reasons, the rhGH treatment was abandoned for a short time. RESULTS: Patients with GHD after treatment re-introduction presented the catch-up growth phenomenon and obtained growth velocity results that were significantly higher than those observed during primary treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Re-introduction of rhGH treatment after short-term therapy cessation leads to the re-occurrence of catch- up growth in patients with GHD.","Kedzia, Andrzej; Majewska, Katarzyna; Korcz, Monika",Pediatr Endocrinol Diabetes Metab,,192

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to describe COVID-19 patients undergoing inpatient rehabilitation and their rehabilitation outcomes. METHODS: Retrospective observational cohort study of all inpatients from a rehabilitation hospital between March 1 and September 30, 2020. Inclusion criteria are: &#8805;18 years of age and admission and discharge within the study time frame. The initial search yielded 920 patients; 896 met the inclusion criteria. Data was derived from the eRehabData database. Subjects were stratified by COVID-19 status and rehabilitation impairment. Data included age, gender, body mass index (BMI), length of stay (LOS), discharge location, and functional ability measures for self-care and mobility (FA-SC, FA-Mob). Descriptive statistics included age, BMI, gender, LOS, and discharge location. One-sample t-tests were used to assess the difference of age, BMI, LOS, FA-SC, FA-Mob, and FA efficiency between COVID-19+ and COVID-19- patients. RESULTS: COVID-19+ patients were younger (59·4 years vs 62·9 years; t(894)= -2·05, p=0·04) with a higher mean BMI (32 vs 28; t(894)= 3·51, p<0·01) than COVID-19- patients. COVID-19+ patients had equivalent or superior improvements in FA-SC and FA-Mob, functional change efficiency, and LOS than COVID-19- patients. Comparing Medically Complex patients, those with COVID-19 had greater FA-SC and FA-Mob efficiencies than COVID-19- patients. COVID-19+ patients had similar rates of return to the community. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COVID-19 who meet the admission criteria for inpatient rehabilitation can benefit from inpatient rehabilitation similarly to their non-COVID-19 counterparts with similar rehabilitation-specific diagnoses.

We aimed to investigate the impact this had on sexual and reproductive health (SRH). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Australians aged 18+ were eligible to participate in an online survey from 23 April to 11 May 2020. We report on the experiences of 518 female participants aged <50 years. Pregnancy intentions and contraceptive use were analysed using descriptive statistics. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated to investigate difficulty accessing SRH products and services. Qualitative data were analysed using conventional content analysis. RESULTS: Most participants were aged 18-24 years, and indicated they were trying to avoid pregnancy. The oral contraceptive pill was the most common single method used however nearly 20% reported they were not using contraception. Women who were employed had less trouble accessing contraception during lockdown. Participants reported delaying childbearing or deciding to remain childfree due to COVID-19. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 lockdown impacted the SRH of Australian women. Findings highlight the importance of continued access to SRH services and products during global emergencies.","Coombe, Jacqueline; Kong, Fabian; Bittleston, Helen; Williams, Hennie; Tomnay, Jane; Vaisey, Alaina; Malta, Sue; Goller, Jane; Temple-Smith, Meredith; Bourchier, Louise; Lau, Andrew; Hocking, Jane S",Eur J Contracept Reprod Health Care,,192

453313,Variable Selection for Causal Inference via Outcome-Adaptive Random Forest,2021-09-09,"INTRODUCTION: Despite carrying a disproportionately high burden of depression, patients in low-income countries lack access to effective care. The collaborative care model (CoCM) has robust evidence for clinical effectiveness in improving mental health outcomes. However, evidence from real-world implementation of CoCM is necessary to inform its expansion in low-resource settings. METHODS: We conducted a 2-year mixed-methods study to assess the implementation and clinical impact of CoCM using the WHO Mental Health Gap Action Programme protocols in a primary care clinic in rural Nepal. We used the Capability Opportunity Motivation-Behaviour (COM-B) implementation research framework to adapt and study the intervention. To assess implementation factors, we qualitatively studied the impact on providers' behaviour to screen, diagnose and treat mental illness. To assess clinical impact, we followed a cohort of 201 patients with moderate to severe depression and determined the proportion of patients who had a substantial clinical response (defined as &#8805;50% decrease from baseline scores of Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) to measure depression) by the end of the study period. RESULTS: Providers experienced improved capability (enhanced self-efficacy and knowledge), greater opportunity (via access to counsellors, psychiatrist, medications and diagnostic tests) and increased motivation (developing positive attitudes towards people with mental illness and seeing patients improve) to provide mental healthcare. We observed substantial clinical response in 99 (49%; 95% CI: 42% to 56%) of the 201 cohort patients, with a median seven point (Q1:-9, Q3:-2) decrease in PHQ-9 scores (p<0.0001). CONCLUSION: Using the COM-B framework, we successfully adapted and implemented CoCM in rural Nepal, and found that it enhanced providers' positive perceptions of and engagement in delivering mental healthcare. We observed clinical improvement of depression comparable to controlled trials in high-resource settings. We recommend using implementation research to adapt and evaluate CoCM in other resource-constrained settings to help expand access to high-quality mental healthcare.","Rimal, Pragya; Choudhury, Nandini; Agrawal, Pawan; Basnet, Madhur; Bohara, Bhavendra; Citrin, David; Dhungana, Santosh Kumar; Gauchan, Bikash; Gupta, Priyanka; Gupta, Tula Krishna; Halliday, Scott; Kadayat, Bharat; Mahar, Ramesh; Maru, Duncan; Nguyen, Viet; Poudel, Sanjaya; Raut, Anant; Rawal, Janaki; Sapkota, Sabitri; Schwarz, Dan; Schwarz, Ryan; Shrestha, Srijana; Swar, Sikhar; Thapa, Aradhana; Thapa, Poshan; White, Rebecca; Acharya, Bibhav",BMJ Open,,192
454556,Endurance,2020,"This study is motivated by the amplified transmission rates of the SAR-CoV-2 virus in areas with high concentrations of fine particulates (PM2.5) as reported in northern Italy and Mexico. To develop a deeper understanding of the contribution of PM2.5 in the propagation of the SAR-CoV-2 virus in the population, the deposition patterns and efficiencies (DEs) of PM2.5 laced with the virus in healthy and asthmatic airways are studied. Physiologically correct 3-D models for generations 10-12 of the human airways are applied to carry out a numerical analysis of two-phase flow for full breathing cycles. Two concentrations of PM2.5 are applied for the simulation, i.e., 30 µgâ m-3 and 80 µgâ m-3 for three breathing statuses, i.e., rest, light exercise, and moderate activity. All the PM2.5 injected into the control volume is assumed to be 100% contaminated with the SAR-CoV-2 virus. Skewed air-flow phenomena at the bifurcations are proportional to the Reynolds number at the inlet, and their intensity in the asthmatic airway exceeded that of the healthy one. Upon exhalation, two peak air-flow vectors from daughter branches combine to form one big vector in the parent generation. Asthmatic airway models has higher deposition efficiencies (DEs) for contaminated PM2.5 as compared to the healthy one. Higher DEs arise in the asthmatic airway model due to complex secondary flows which increase the impaction of contaminated PM2.5 on airways' walls.","Chen, Wei-Hsin; Mutuku, Justus Kavita; Yang, Zhe-Wei; Hwang, Chii-Jong; Lee, Wen Jhy; Ashokkumar, Veeramuthu",Environ Res,,192

Objective: The objective is to present our inpatient experience with COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants. This is a retrospective study of 681 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from six hospitals in the Denver metropolitan area admitted between February 18 and April 30, 2020. Clinical outcomes of patients discharged or expired by April 30, 2020, were analyzed. Main Outcomes. We compiled patient demographics, length of stay, number of patients transferred to or admitted to the ICU, ICU length of stay, mechanical ventilation requirements, and mortality rates. Results: Of the 890 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, 681 had discharged and were included in this analysis. We observed 100% survival of the 0-18 age group (n = 2), 97% survival of the 19-30 age group, 95% survival of the 31-64 age group, 79% survival of the 65-84 age group, and 75% survival of the 85 and older age group. Our total inpatient mortality was 13% (91 patients), rising to 29% (59 patients) for those requiring ICU care. Conclusions: Compared to similar reports from other metropolitan areas, our analysis of discharged or expired COVID-19 patients from six major hospitals in the Denver metropolitan area revealed a lower mortality. This includes the subset of patients admitted to the ICU regardless of the need for intubation. A lower ICU length of stay was also observed.","Watts, Paula J; Wojcik, Trevor; Baker-Sparr, Christina; Kelly, Jason L; Sharma, Surit; Scherbak, Dmitriy",Adv Med,,192

FACT: There is currently no direct evidence to suggest that a corticosteroid injection before or after the administration of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine decreases the efficacy of the vaccine.However, based on the known timeline of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression following epidural and intraarticular corticosteroid injections, and the timeline of the reported peak efficacy of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, physicians should consider timing an elective corticosteroid injection such that it is administered no less than 2 weeks prior to a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine dose and no less than 1 week following a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine dose, whenever possible.","Lee, Haewon; Punt, Jennifer A; Miller, David C; Nagpal, Ameet; Smith, Clark C; Sayeed, Yusef; Patel, Jaymin; Stojanovic, Milan P; Popescu, Adrian; McCormick, Zachary L",Pain Med,,192

459449,"Dog noses detect heat, the world faces coronavirus, and scientists search for extraterrestrial life",2020,"COVID-19-related quarantine measures resulted in a significant increase of interest in online collaboration tools. This includes virtual reality (VR) or, in more general term, extended reality (XR) solutions. Shared XR allows for activities such as presentations, training of personnel or therapy to take place in a virtual space instead of a real one. To make online XR as accessible as possible, a significant effort has been put into the development of solutions that can run directly in web browsers. One of the most recognized solutions is the A-Frame software framework, created by Mozilla VR team and supporting most of the contemporary XR hardware. In addition, an extension called Networked-Aframe allows multiple users to share virtual environments, created using A-Frame, in real time. In this article, we introduce and experimentally evaluate three components that extend the functionality of A-Frame and Networked-Aframe. The first one extends Networked-Aframe with the ability to monitor and control users in a shared virtual scene. The second one implements six degrees of freedom motion tracking for smartphone-based VR headsets. The third one brings hand gesture support to the Microsoft HoloLens holographic computer. The evaluation was performed in a dedicated local network environment with 5, 10, 15 and 20 client computers. Each computer represented one user in a shared virtual scene. Since the experiments were carried out with and without the introduced components, the results presented here can also be regarded as a performance evaluation of A-Frame and Networked-Aframe themselves. © 2021 by the authors.

459879,The development and deployment of formal methods in the UK,2020-06-11,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has led to a global decrease in personal protective equipment (PPE), especially filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs). Ultraviolet-C wavelength is a promising way of decontamination, however adequate dosimetry is needed to ensure balance between over and underexposed areas and provide reliable results. Our study demonstrates that UVGI light irradiance varies significantly on different respirator angles and propose a method to decontaminate several masks at once ensuring appropriate dosage in shaded zones. An UVGI irradiator was built with internal dimensions of 69.5 × 55 × 33 cm with three 15 W UV lamps. Inside, a grating of 58 × 41 × 15 cm was placed to hold the masks. Two different flat fold respirator models were used to assess irradiance, four of model Aura 9322 3 M of dimensions 17 × 9 × 4 cm (tri-fold), and two of model SAFE 231FFP3NR (bi-fold) with dimensions 17 × 6 × 5 cm. An STN-SilverNova spectrometer was employed to verify wavelength spectrum and surface irradiance. A simulation was performed to find the irradiance pattern inside the box and the six masks placed inside. These simulations were carried out using the software DIALUX EVO 8.2. The data obtained reveal that the irradiance received inside the manufactured UVGI-irradiator depends not only on the distance between the lamps' plane and the base of the respirators but also on the orientation and shape of the masks. This point becomes relevant to assure that all the respirators inside the chamber receive the correct dosage. Irradiance over FFR surfaces depend on several factors such as distance and angle of incidence of the light source. Careful irradiance measurement and simulation can ensure reliable dosage in the whole mask surface, balancing overexposure. Closed box systems might provide a more reliable, reproducible UVGI dosage than open settings.","Baluja, Aurora; Arines, Justo; Vilanova, Ramón; Cortiñas, Julio; Bao-Varela, Carmen; Flores-Arias, Maria Teresa",J Occup Environ Hyg,,192

Herein, we report the development of a rapid (less than 5 min), low-cost, easy-to-implement, and quantitative paper-based electrochemical sensor chip to enable the digital detection of SARS-CoV-2 genetic material. The biosensor uses gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), capped with highly specific antisense oligonucleotides (ssDNA) targeting viral nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (N-gene). The sensing probes are immobilized on a paper-based electrochemical platform to yield a nucleic-acid-testing device with a readout that can be recorded with a simple hand-held reader. The biosensor chip has been tested using samples collected from Vero cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus and clinical samples. The sensor provides a significant improvement in output signal only in the presence of its target-SARS-CoV-2 RNA-within less than 5 min of incubation time, with a sensitivity of 231 (copies µL-1)-1 and limit of detection of 6.9 copies/µL without the need for any further amplification. The sensor chip performance has been tested using clinical samples from 22 COVID-19 positive patients and 26 healthy asymptomatic subjects confirmed using the FDA-approved RT-PCR COVID-19 diagnostic kit. The sensor successfully distinguishes the positive COVID-19 samples from the negative ones with almost 100% accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity and exhibits an insignificant change in output signal for the samples lacking a SARS-CoV-2 viral target segment (e.g., SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, or negative COVID-19 samples collected from healthy subjects). The feasibility of the sensor even during the genomic mutation of the virus is also ensured from the design of the ssDNA-conjugated AuNPs that simultaneously target two separate regions of the same SARS-CoV-2 N-gene.","Alafeef, Maha; Dighe, Ketan; Moitra, Parikshit; Pan, Dipanjan",ACS nano,,192

465726,The isolated zoologist,2020,"BACKGROUND: One year into the coronavirus diseases 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic we analyzed the blood coagulopathy in severe and non-severe COVID-19 patients and linked to those of influenza patients for a comparative study. METHODS: We reported 461 COVID-19 patients and 409 seasonal influenza patients admitted at separated medical centers. With their demographic data and medical history, hematological profiles with coagulation characters were emphasized, and compared between two cohorts before and after treatment. RESULTS: For 870 patients included in this study, their median age was (64.0, 51.0-76.0), and among them 511 (58.7%) were male. Hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and bronchitis constituted the leading comorbidities. Upon hospital admission blood test results differentiated COVID-19 patients from influenza cases, and for COVID-19 patients, leukocytosis, neutrophilia, lymphocytopenia, and thrombocytopenia were associated with disease severity and mortality. In addition, COVID-19 cohort demonstrated a prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), increased INR, shortened thrombin time and decreased fibrinogen, compared to those in influenza cohort, leaving D-dimer levels indistinguishably high between both cohorts. Platelet hyperreactivity in COVID-19 is more evident, associated with worse hyper-inflammatory response and more refractory coagulopathy. For severe COVID-19 patients administered with anticoagulants, bleeding incidence was substantially higher than others with no anticoagulant medications. CONCLUSIONS: Comparison of coagulation characteristics between COVID-19 and influenza infections provides an insightful view on SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and its coagulopathic mechanism, proposing for therapeutic improvement.","Zhang, J.; Huang, X.; Ding, D.; Tao, Z.",Experimental Hematology &amp; Oncology,,192

The histone-modifying enzymes (HMEs) represent promising targets for the development of epigenetic drugs against Schistosoma mansoni. In the present study, we targeted the S. mansoni lysine-specific demethylase 1 (SmLSD1), a transcriptional corepressor, using a novel and selective synthetic inhibitor, MC3935, which was used to treat schistosomula and adult worms in vitro. By using cell viability assays and optical and electron microscopy, we showed that treatment with MC3935 affected parasite motility, egg-laying, tegument, and cellular organelle structures, culminating in the death of schistosomula and adult worms. In silico molecular modeling and docking analysis suggested that MC3935 binds to the catalytic pocket of SmLSD1. Western blot analysis revealed that MC3935 inhibited SmLSD1 demethylation activity of H3K4me1/2. Knockdown of SmLSD1 by RNAi recapitulated MC3935 phenotypes in adult worms. RNA-Seq analysis of MC3935-treated parasites revealed significant differences in gene expression related to critical biological processes. Collectively, our findings show that SmLSD1 is a promising drug target for the treatment of schistosomiasis and strongly support the further development and in vivo testing of selective schistosome LSD1 inhibitors.","Coutinho Carneiro, Vitor; de Abreu da Silva, Isabel Caetano; Amaral, Murilo Sena; Pereira, Adriana S A; Silveira, Gilbert Oliveira; Pires, David da Silva; Verjovski-Almeida, Sergio; Dekker, Frank J; Rotili, Dante; Mai, Antonello; Lopes-Torres, Eduardo José; Robaa, Dina; Sippl, Wolfgang; Pierce, Raymond J; Borrello, M Teresa; Ganesan, A; Lancelot, Julien; Thiengo, Silvana; Fernandez, Monica Ammon; Vicentino, Amanda Roberta Revoredo; Mourão, Marina Moraes; Coelho, Fernanda Sales; Fantappié, Marcelo Rosado",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,,192

The secondary objective was to identify the predictive clinical factors for the evolution of these symptoms. METHODS: A prospective case-control study was conducted from March 15 to October 15, 2020, in health workers with COVID-19 related symptoms in a tertiary care hospital. 320 patients were included after 6 months of follow-up: 195 in the case group and 125 in the control group. Olfactory dysfunction (OD), dysosmia, and gustatory dysfunction (GD) onset and recovery rate after 6 months follow-up are analyzed in both groups. RESULTS: There were 125 (64.1%) in case group patients with OD and 118 (60.5%) with GD. Total or partial recovery OD and GD was found in 89%, mainly in the first 2 months. In the control group, there were 14 (11.2%) patients with OD and 33 (26.4%) patients with GD, with 100% of total/partial recovery. CONCLUSION: In both groups, OD and GD showed high-resolution rates during the first two months after the onset of symptoms. Nevertheless, 11% of the case group patients did not show any recovery, and the partial resolution was present in 30% of our patients, at the 6 months follow-up.

The purpose of this research is to know and measure the ease and usefulness of e-wallet digital wallet services, especially in the GoPay application. The population in this study are users of the Go-Pay service on the GO-JEK platform. The sample of this study consisted of 124 respondents from distributing questionnaires in Depok, West Java using a modified Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) based on existing references. The data processing in this research uses Importance Performance Analysis (IPA) analysis. The results show that based on the gap analysis, it is found that in general Go-Pay users are not satisfied with the current service quality. Based on the IPA analysis, the priority scale of E-Wallet Go-Pay quality improvement can be mapped, where quadrant I is the highest priority scale according to the user's perspective: [1], [4], [5], and [6]. These three items must be upgraded immediately by the manager to meet user expectations. Areas that become the achievements or advantages of the GoPay E-Wallet that must be maintained are in quadrant II, namely: [2] and [3]. From this explanation, it can be concluded that in general the E-Wallet GoPay Service must be improved to improve its service performance.","Saputra, Dedi; Gurbuz, Burcu",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.09049v1.pdf,192

Concerns about concentration and allegations of anticompetitive behavior have led to several inquiries and civil suits by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Department of Justice, with increases in price differentials serving as a focal point. This article notes the difference between price spreads and marketing margins, outlines corresponding economic theory, and describes the empirical evidence on wholesale meat and livestock price dynamics in the wake of COVID-19 disruptions. At one point during the pandemic, beef and pork packers were both operating at about 60% of the previous year's processing volume. We explore how such a massive supply shock would be expected to affect marketing margins even in the absence of anti-competitive behavior. Moreover, we document how margin measurements are critically sensitive to the selection of data and information utilized. Finally, we conclude with some discussion around policy proposals that would pit industry concentration against industry coordination and economies of scale.","Lusk, Jayson L; Tonsor, Glynn T; Schulz, Lee L",,,192

METHODS: An online survey with a random sample of 407 Internet users aged 60 years and over (Meanâ¯=â¯69.14). RESULTS: Participants reported a significant increase in 7 of 12 Internet-based functions following the pandemic onset. Stress levels were moderate-to-high and participants appeared more worried about others than about themselves. Significant positive associations were found between stress and increase in Internet use for interpersonal communication and online errands. Linear regression analysis revealed a significant negative association between stress and subjective wellbeing, but it was only increased Internet use for leisure that associated significantly with enhanced wellbeing. CONCLUSION: The changes in Internet use clearly reflected coping efforts that were apparently ineffective in enhancing wellbeing. Paradoxically, the only online functions that could improve wellbeing, Internet use for leisure, are precisely those whose use hardly increased.","Nimrod, Galit",Am J Geriatr Psychiatry,,192

The initial outbreak was of considerable size first in China subsequently spread to the rest of the world. Immediately after the epidemic (which according to the World Health Organization had risen to pandemic status), the problem of whether or not to update the occupational risk assessment arose, also considering how the biological risk from SARS CoV-2 should be understood: specific or generic. To this end, we conducted a literature review to identify national health legislation and policies, examining how Italy has addressed the COVID-19 emergency in occupational health planning, in order to develop considerations on the need to update the Risk Assessment Document following the pandemic status. The data that emerged from the review of current legislation allowed us to conclude that the risk from SARS-CoV-2 is in most work activities to be understood as a generic or aggravated generic risk, requiring the employer to apply and control the preventive measures suggested by health authorities to contain the spread of the virus.","Cirrincione, L.; Rapisarda, V.; Mazzucco, W.; Provenzano, R.; Cannizzaro, E.",International Journal of Environmental Research &amp; Public Health [Electronic Resource],,192

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study of occupational health services (OHS) records. SETTING: A large, urban, academic medical center with 5 inpatient campuses and multiple ambulatory centers throughout Bronx and Westchester counties. PARTICIPANTS: We included HCWs who called OHS to report COVID-19 symptoms and had either severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or IgG antibody testing. METHODS: We analyzed the impact of COVID-19-related symptoms on (1) time from symptom onset to return to work, (2) the results of SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal PCR testing, and (3) the results of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody testing in HCWs with mild-to-moderate COVID-19. RESULTS: The median time from symptom onset until return to work for HCWs who did not require hospitalization was 15 days (interquartile range, 10-22). Shortness of breath, fever, sore throat, and diarrhea were significantly associated with longer durations from symptom onset to return to work. Among symptomatic HCWs who had PCR testing during the study period, 51.9% tested positive. Of the previously symptomatic HCWs who had IgG antibody testing, 55.4% had reactive tests. Ageusia was associated with having both positive PCR and reactive antibody tests. Sore throat was associated with both negative PCR and nonreactive antibody tests. CONCLUSION: HCWs with COVID-19 who did not require hospitalization still had prolonged illness. Shortness of breath, fever, sore throat, and diarrhea are associated with longer durations of time away from work.","Ganz-Lord, Fran A; Segal, Kathryn R; Rinke, Michael L",Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,,192

We examined the influenza season 2017/18 in terms of hospitalisation and mortality in the Austrian paediatric population and put the results into perspective of the available data from the last 15 years. METHODS: Cases of influenza-associated hospitalisations and deaths for season 2017/18 in children below 18 years were retrospectively collected from 12 and 33 Austrian hospitals, respectively. Hospitalisation and mortality rates for the whole Austrian paediatric population were estimated, adjusting for the population in each catchment area. Two Austrian databases were queried for hospitalisations and deaths associated with influenza during 2002-2016. Rough estimate of the vaccination coverage was calculated from a survey on 100 inpatients. RESULTS: Influenza-related paediatric hospitalisation rate in season 2017/18 was estimated as 128 (CI: 122-135) per 100,000 children, much higher than the national average of 40 per 100,000 over the years 2002-2016. There were nine reported influenza-associated deaths among children, resulting in mortality rate of 0.67 (CI: 0.32-1.21) per 100,000 children. CONCLUSIONS: Reported influenza-associated hospitalisations and fatalities demonstrate a high burden of influenza in the Austrian paediatric population corresponding with very low vaccination coverage.","Kohlmaier, Benno; Svendova, Vendula; Walcher, Thomas; Pilch, Heidemarie; Krenn, Larissa; Kurz, Herbert; Zwiauer, Karl; Zenz, Werner",BMC Public Health,,192

479600,Reacting to outbreaks at neighboring localities,2021,"Background: Sex differences are encountered in many aspects of ischemic stroke, including risk factors, presenting symptoms, stroke mechanism, acute interventions and functional outcomes. As telestroke services continue to expand, many patients utilize telestroke for the evaluation and treatment of suspected stroke symptoms. To date, the existence of such differences between sexes has not been identified in the patient population having utilized telestroke for acute stroke care. Methods: A retrospective observational study of the experience of a single teleneurology practice serving 340 hospitals from April 2018 to June 2020 was performed. Patients seen in the emergency department (ED) with a diagnosis of suspected stroke were included. Data from the acute stroke encounter was reported through the current medical record platform. Results: Within the queried period, there were 11,454 male and 11,794 female patients identified as having received ED telestroke evaluation for suspected acute stroke. Males were younger than females (67 vs 70, P&lt;0.01). Males had higher rates of prior stroke, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and coronary disease than females (P&lt;0.01), while females had higher rates of atrial fibrillation (P=0.03) and TIA (P&lt;0.01). Rates of antiplatelet and anticoagulants were higher in males (P&lt;0.01) than females. There were no differences in time to ED presentation, time to request consult or make a thrombolysis decision, or length of consult. Females had higher stroke severity (P&lt;0.01) and door-to-needle times (P&lt;0.01), but lower alteplase rates (P=0.02) compared to males. Conclusion: This review of a national heterogeneous telestroke patient population is indicative of sex differences in multiple aspects of acute ischemic stroke, most notably in thrombolysis delivered via telestroke. Further investigation into the etiology of such differences is warranted, as well as a survey of functional outcomes. As telemedicine continues to expand in the era of the COVID-19pandemic, it is imperative that the reasons behind this disparity are investigated.","Morton, J.

OBJECTIVE: To describe our endovascular experience in a consecutive series of patients with COVID-19 who presented with large vessel occlusions, and to describe unique findings in this population. METHODS: Mechanical thrombectomy was performed on five consecutive patients with COVID-19 with large vessel occlusions. A retrospective study of these patients was performed. Patient demographics, laboratory values, mechanical thrombectomy technique, and clinical and angiographic outcomes were reviewed. RESULTS: Four patients with COVID-19 presented with anterior circulation occlusions and one patient with COVID-19 presented with both anterior and posterior circulation occlusions. All patients had coagulation abnormalities. Mean patient age was 52.8 years. Three patients presented with an intracranial internal carotid artery occlusion. Two patients presented with an intracranial occlusion and a tandem thrombus in the carotid bulb. One patient presented with an occlusion in both the internal carotid and basilar arteries. Clot fragmentation and distal emboli to a new vascular territory were seen in two of five (40%) patients, and downstream emboli were seen in all five (100%) patients. Patient clinical outcome was generally poor in this series of patients with COVID-19 large vessel occlusion. CONCLUSION: Our series of patients with COVID-19 demonstrated coagulation abnormalities, and compared with our previous experience with mechanical thrombectomy in large vessel occlusion, this group of patients were younger, had tandem or multiple territory occlusions, a large clot burden, and a propensity for clot fragmentation. These patients present unique challenges that make successful revascularization difficult.","Wang, Arthur; Mandigo, Grace K; Yim, Peter D; Meyers, Philip M; Lavine, Sean D",J Neurointerv Surg,,192

Physical activity has been shown to improve mental as well as physical health. Increasing activity levels should be prioritized as a treatment target, especially when the barriers to exercise are greater than ever. Promoting physical activity has not traditionally been the remit of psychologists. Yet psychological theory and therapeutic techniques can be readily applied to address physical inactivity. We present theoretical perspectives and therapy techniques relating to (1) beliefs about physical activity, (2) motivation to be physically active, and (3) the sense of reward achieved through being physically active. We outline strategies to initiate and maintain physical activity during the COVID-19 pandemic, thereby benefitting mental and physical health. COVID-19 is demanding rapid and substantial change across the whole health care system. Psychological therapists can respond creatively by addressing physical activity, a treatable clinical target which delivers both mental and physical health benefits. PRACTITIONER POINTS: Physical activity is essential for our mental and physical health. Yet COVID-19 presents novel barriers to physical activity. Psychological theory and techniques to address beliefs, motivation, and reward can be applied to increase physical activity during COVID-19.

A identificação de dor foi baseada em analises fisiológica (cortisol sérico e frequência respiratória), comportamental, de expressão facial e análogo visual nos momentos -30 (30 minutos antes do procedimento) e 1, 3, 6 12, 24, 72 e 420 horas após o procedimento; e com a exceção do cortisol, todas as analises foram realizadas sem a interferência do avaliador com o animal, por meio de filmagens de vídeos. Notou-se que todas as metodologias propostas foram capazes de identificar dor pós orquiectomia em bovinos, no entanto a graduação de maior dor foi em momentos pós-cirúrgicos distintos conforme o parâmetro avaliado. Assim houve fraca correlação entre os modelos propostos, pois se encontrou limitações para a maioria das metodologias avaliadas, concluindo-se que a associação entre os vários parâmetros de dor, tal qual o utilizado na escala análogo visual, aumenta a acurácia em identificar a dor após orquiectomia em bovinos.(AU)","Bertagnon, Heloisa G; Batista, Camila F; Bellinazzi, Jessyca B; Coneglian, Mariana M; Mendes, Adriano F; Libera, Alice M.

486646,On the Angular Momentum Transport Efficiency within the Star Constrained from Gravitational-wave Observations,2021-08-10,"Anticoagulation plays a major role in reducing the risk of systematic thrombosis in patients with severe COVID-19. Serious hemorrhagic complications, such as intracranial hemorrhage, have also been recognized. However, intra-abdominal hemorrhage is under-recognized because of its rare occurrence, despite high mortality. Here, we discuss two cases of spontaneous iliopsoas hematoma (IPH) likely caused by anticoagulants during the clinical course of COVID-19. We also explored published case reports to identify clinical characteristics of IPH in COVID-19 patients. The use of anticoagulants may increase the risk of lethal IPH among COVID-19 patients becsuse of scarce data on optimal dosage and adequate monitoring of anticoagulant effects. Rapid diagnosis and timely intervention are crucial to ensure good patient outcomes.","Nakamura, Hideta; Ouchi, Gen; Miyagi, Kazuya; Higure, Yuuri; Otsuki, Mariko; Nishiyama, Naoya; Kinjo, Takeshi; Nakamatsu, Masashi; Tateyama, Masao; Kukita, Ichiro; Fujita, Jiro",Am. j. trop. med. hyg,,192

488341,An open letter to Japan's new Prime Minister,2020,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has profoundly affected the mental health of both infected and uninfected people. Although most psychiatric disorders have highly overlapping genetic and pathogenic backgrounds, most studies investigating the impact of the pandemic have examined only single psychiatric disorders. It is necessary to examine longitudinal trajectories of factors that modulate psychiatric states across multiple dimensions. 2274 Japanese citizens participated in online surveys presented in December 2019 (before the pandemic), August 2020, Dec 2020, and April 2021. These surveys included nine questionnaires on psychiatric symptoms, such as depression and anxiety. Multi-dimensional psychiatric time series data were then decomposed into four principal components. We used generalized linear models to identify modulating factors for effects of the pandemic on these components. The four principal components can be interpreted as general psychiatric burden, social withdrawal, alcohol-related problems, and depression/anxiety. Principal components associated with general psychiatric burden and depression/anxiety peaked during the initial phase of the pandemic. They were further exacerbated by the economic burden of the pandemic. In contrast, principal components associated with social withdrawal showed a delayed peak, with human relationships as an important risk modulating factor. In addition, being elderly and female were risk factors shared across all components. Our results show that COVID-19 has imposed a large and varied burden on the Japanese population since the commencement of the pandemic. Although components related to the general psychiatric burden remained elevated, peak intensities differed between components related to depression/anxiety and those related to social anxiety. These results underline the importance of using flexible monitoring and mitigation strategies for mental problems, according to the phase of the pandemic.","Oka, Taiki; Kubo, Takatomi; Kobayashi, Nao; Nakai, Fumiya; Miyake, Yuka; Hamamura, Toshitaka; Honjo, Masaru; Toda, Hiroyuki; Boku, Shuken; Kanazawa, Tetsufumi; Nagamine, Masanori; Cortese, Aurelio; Takebayashi, Minoru; Kawato, Mitsuo; Chiba, Toshinori",,,192
488364,Selected topics on reaction-diffusion-advection models from spatial ecology,2020-04-16,"Background: The impact of COVID-19 vaccination on breastfeeding is unknown. The primary aim of this study was to determine whether vaccine-related side effects following COVID-19 vaccination were associated with an adverse impact on breastfeeding. Secondarily, we sought to determine perceived symptoms in breastfed children and maternal opinion about COVID-19 vaccination. Materials and Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of breastfeeding mothers who underwent COVID-19 vaccination >2 days before the survey. Subjects were recruited through social media and websites. Data included sociodemographic information, vaccine history, maternal and child symptoms, and impact on lactation/breastfeeding. Bivariate statistics (chi-square, Wilcoxon rank sum, and t tests) and multivariable logistic regression models examined the association of vaccine side effects with lactation, symptoms in breastfed children, and maternal opinion on vaccination. Results: Analysis included 4,455 breastfeeding mothers. Maternal postvaccination symptoms were more common after the second dose (p < 0.001). Overall, 77 (1.7%) respondents reported a negative impact on breastfeeding postvaccination, and these mothers were more likely to have experienced fatigue, headache, muscle pain, injection site pain, chills, fever, or allergic reactions. After adjusting for confounding variables, higher odds of an adverse impact on lactation were associated with lower breastfeeding intensity, dose of vaccine, and child symptoms. Even among mothers who reported an adverse impact on breastfeeding, maternal opinion about vaccination and confidence in their decision to receive the COVID-19 vaccine were high. Conclusions: COVID-19 vaccination among breastfeeding mothers resulted in minimal disruption of lactation or adverse impact on the breastfed child. These findings may be considered in vaccination decision-making.","McLaurin-Jiang, Skyler; Garner, Christine D; Krutsch, Kaytlin; Hale, Thomas W",Breastfeed. med,,192

METHODS: Whole-blood from 56 COVID-19 and 23 ""NO-COVID-19"" individuals were stimulated overnight with different concentrations (0.1 or 1 µg/mL) of SARS-CoV-2 PepTivator® Peptide Pools, including spike (pool S), nucleocapsid (pool N), membrane (pool M), and a MegaPool (MP) of these three peptide pools. ELISA was used to analyse interferon (IFN)-Î³ levels. RESULTS: The IFN-Î³-response to every SARS-CoV-2 peptide pool was significantly increased in COVID-19 patients compared with NO-COVID-19 individuals. Pool S and MegaPool were the most potent immunogenic stimuli (median: 0.51, IQR: 0.14-2.17; and median: 1.18, IQR: 0.27-4.72, respectively) compared with pools N and M (median: 0.22, IQR: 0.032-1.26; and median: 0.22, IQR: 0.01-0.71, respectively). The whole-blood test based on pool S and MegaPool showed a good sensitivity of 77% and a high specificity of 96%.

Aim of the study was to evaluate the management of severe ARF due to COVID-19 pneumonia using noninvasive ventilatory support (NIVS), studying safety and effectiveness of NIVS. METHODS: This is a retrospective, multicenter study. Primary outcomes were NIVS failure with intubation rate and hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were hospital stay and factors related to NIVS failure and mortality. These outcomes were compared with patients intubated and admitted to ICU. RESULTS: One hundred sixty-two patients were hospitalized because of severe respiratory failure (PaO2/FiO2 ratio <250). One hundred thirty-eight patients were admitted to Respiratory Intermediate Care Unit (RICU) for a NIVS trial. One hundred patients were treated successfully with NIVS (74.5%); 38 failed NIVS trial (27.5%). In-hospital mortality was 23.18% in RICU group and 30.55% in ICU group. Patients with NIVS failure were older, had a lower number of lymphocytes, a higher IL-6, lower PaO2, PaC O2, PaO2/FiO2 ratio, higher respiratory rate (RR) and heart rate at admission and lower PaO2, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio and higher RR after 1-6 hours. Multivariate analysis identified higher age, C-reactive protein as well as RR after 1-6 hours and PaO2/FiO2 ratio after 1-6 hours as an independent predictor mortality. CONCLUSIONS: NIVS is a safe and effective strategy in the treatment of severe ARF due to COVID-19 related pneumonia, that reduces mortality and length of hospital stay in the carefully selected patients.","Diaz DE Teran, Teresa; Gonzales Martinez, Monica; Banfi, Paolo; Garuti, Giancarlo; Ferraioli, Gianluca; Russo, Giuseppe; Casu, Francesco; Vivarelli, Michela; Bonfiglio, Monica; Perazzo, Alessandro; Barlascini, Cornelius; Bauleo, Armando; Nicolini, Antonello; Solidoro, Paolo",Minerva Med,,192

498137,"Recent advancements in microbial fuel cells: A review on its electron transfer mechanisms, microbial community, types of substrates and design for bio-electrochemical treatment",2021,"One of the main topics discussed by historians, including those of science, in the late twentieth century is the historical introspection into ""modernism,"" a term based on a teleological view of the world. According to the conventional understanding of world history, the historical process to modernity that has led to the Civil Revolution, Scientific Revolution, and Capitalism is linear and universally inevitable, and this-in other words, Eurocentrism-implies that only the historical experiences of Europeans are relevant. This mainstream view of world history has spread the dichotomous analytic framework of historiography and reinforced cultural essentialism, which has eventually given a Euro- or Sino-centric hierarchical presentation of history. This type of world view rests on the assumption that there are intrinsic and incommensurable differences between cultures or localities, which a lot of commentators and scholars have constantly countered by arguing that that presumption does not comply with what historical sources say. Drawing on some trail-blazing scholarship of cultural studies and others, this essay turns away from this ""conventional"" framework of historiography and presents a world view that is framed in the context of trans-locality, interconnectedness, plurality, heterogeneity, polycentricity, and diversity. In recent years, in an attempt to search for new analytic frames, some endeavors have emerged in the field of cultural or science studies to go beyond just providing critical commentaries or case studies. Furthermore, researchers and scholars in the history of science, technology and medicine in East Asia have put an effort into conceptualizing and establishing such new analytic frames. Among those approaches are attempts to shed light upon the trans-local yet global interconnectedness (emphatically in pre-modern periods), diverse historical trajectories to modernities, and polycentric as well as plural landscape of scientific enterprises over time and across the world. On top of these new visions of world history, this essay further elaborates on and proposes some conceptive ideas: (1) ""Tradition"" as a set of recipes, which could replace the idea of the living yet dead tradition; (2) ""Medicine"" as a problem-solving activity, which calls more attention to historical actors of East Asian medicine; (3) ""East Asian medicines"" as a family of trans-locally related practices in East Asia, which would lead to going beyond the nationalist historiography such as Sino-centrism; (4) ""Problematique"" as the system of questions and concepts which make up East Asian medicine, which should reveal what East Asian medicines have been about; (5) ""Styles of Practice"" for the historiography of East Asian medicines, as opposed to the cultural account, epistemological historiography or praxiography; and, as an illustrative example, (6) ""Topological Bodies"" for the history of anatomy in East Asia. Going beyond tradition and dichotomous historiography, these new methodologies or conceptual ideas will contribute to the understanding of the history of East Asian medicines.","Yi, Kiebok",Uisahak,,192

This nationwide survey study aims to evaluate the 1-year impact of the pandemic on training of neurosurgical residents. METHODS: A 38-question Web-based survey was sent to 356 neurosurgery residents. Two hundred and thirty-five participated in the study (66% response rate), representing more than half of all neurosurgical residents in the country. RESULTS: Assignment to direct COVID-19 medical care was common (85.5%). Many of the neurosurgery residents (37.9%) were tested positive for COVID-19. Almost half of the respondents reported a decrease in work hours. Most participants (84.3%) reported a decline in total operative case volume (mean change, -29.1% ± 1.6%), largely as a result of a decrease in elective (-33.2% ± 1.6%) as opposed to emergency cases (-5.1% ± 1.8%). For theoretic education, most respondents (54.9%) indicated a negative impact, whereas 25.1% reported a positive impact. For practical training, most respondents (78.7%) reported an adverse effect. A decrease in elective surgical case volume predicted a positive impact on theoretic training but a negative impact on practical training. Research productivity was reported by 33.2% to have decreased and by 23% to have increased. Forty-two percent indicated an increase in concerns about their training and career, with a negative impact on practical training being the most important predictor. Most (57.4%) had considered extending residency training to overcome negative effects of the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 has had a significant impact on neurosurgical practice and training. Effective measures should be used to mitigate these effects and better prepare for the future challenges.","Sahin, Balkan; Hanalioglu, Sahin",World neurosurgery (Online),,192
502358,Pacemaker lead implantation in a patient with transcatheter bicaval prosthesis,2020,"Objectives: During this ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), procalcitonin (PCT) assay has proven to be a useful tool in assisting clinicians to diagnose bacterial superinfection. However, in the absence of signs of infection or at resolution thereof, inappropriately and persistently high PCT may suggest and reveal the presence of other pathologies. We report a patient with acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia in whom persistence of initially elevated PCT during recovery prompted the diagnosis of medullary thyroid cancer (MTC). Case report: A 43- year-old man presented with a two-day history of fever, sneezing, sore throat and dry cough. Physical exam revealed decreased sounds and coarse crackles in both lung bases at auscultation. Medical history was positive for cognitive impairment since birth, arterial hypertension, systemic lupus erythematosus with nephritis. Initial studies included mild lymphocytopenia 650/µl (760 - 5000), D-Dimer 0.73 µg/ml (< 0.5), C reactive protein (CRP) of 62 mg/l (< 5) and PCT of 94 ng/ml (0.00 - 0.10). Positivity for SARS-Cov-2 RNA was detected and chest computerized tomography showed bilateral ground-glass opacities in the basilar lung zones and hyperdense and irregular foci in the thoracic vertebral bodies. Empirical antibiotic therapy was started and was maintained for seven days but, despite clinical improvement and the normalization of CRP, serum PCT was persistently high (84 ng/ml). Serum calcitonin (CTN) was 2120 pg/ml (normal up to 12 pg/ml). Neck ultrasound revealed inhomogeneously echogenic lymph nodes with small punctate calcifications and a non-homogeneous thyroid with multiple nodules. Cytological examination by fine needle aspiration and CTN measurement on washing liquid confirmed the suspicion of MTC. The patient underwent total thyroidectomy with bilateral cervical lymph node dissection. Histological analysis confirmed MTC of right thyroid lobe and metastasis at lymph nodes of the central right midneck area. Blood tests performed 48 hours after surgery showed a lowering of CTN (986 pg/mL) and PCT (16 ng/mL). A 6-months follow up showed persistent increased CTN and PCT levels (921 pg/ml and 16 ng/ml, respectively) while a (18)F-fluorodihydro-xyphenylalanine ((18)F-DOPA) PET did not reveal any suspicious fixations at thyroid lodge and cervical lymph node stations while multiple osteoblastic foci in the skeletal area were described. A close follow-up was planned with establishment of the results of RET gene analysis. Discussion: Although CTN is the gold standard biochemical parameter for the diagnosis and follow-up of MTC, PCT can be useful as a biochemical marker of MTC suspicion in patients with inflammatory conditions and persistently elevated PCT even after resolution. In the present CASE, high levels of PCT in a patient with Covid-19 pneumonia without signs of bacterial infection, allowed to diagnose MCT. Conclusion: In the absence of any other signs of infection, a complete clinical assessment, including neck palpation, CTN measurement and thyroid ultrasound should be performed in the presence of persistently elevated PCT.","Laura, Gianotti; Salvatore, D039; Agnano,; Giorgio, Pettiti; Francesco, Tassone; Giorgio, Giraudo; Corrado, Lauro; Giuseppe, Lauria; Valerio, Del Bono; Giorgio, Borretta",,,192

After an initial period with a low incidence of newly infected people, a power-law growth of the number of confirmed cases is observed. For each country, a distinct growth exponent is obtained. For Belgium, UK, and USA, countries with a large number of infected people, after the power-law growth a distinct behavior is obtained when approaching saturation. Brazil is still in the power-law regime. Such updates of the data and projections corroborate recent results regarding the power-law growth of the virus and their strong Distance Correlation between some countries around the world. Furthermore, we show that act in time is one of the most relevant non-pharmacological weapons that the health organizations have in the battle against the COVID-19, infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. We study how changing the social distance and the number of daily tests to identify infected asymptomatic individuals can interfere in the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 when applied in three distinct days, namely April 16th (early), April 30th (current), and May 14th (late). Results show that containment actions are necessary to flatten the curves and should be applied as soon as possible.","Brugnago, Eduardo L.; Silva, Rafael M. da; Manchein, Cesar; Beims, Marcus W.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.01473v1.pdf,192

Currently, there is no worldwide-approved effective treatment for COVID-19, urging the scientific community to intense efforts to accelerate the discovery and development of prophylactic and therapeutic solutions against SARS-CoV-2 infection. In particular, effective antiviral drugs are urgently needed. With few exceptions, therapeutic approaches to combat viral infections have traditionally focused on targeting unique viral components or enzymes; however, it has now become evident that this strategy often fails due to the rapid emergence of drug-resistant viruses. Targeting host factors that are essential for the virus life cycle, but are dispensable for the host, has recently received increasing attention. The spike glycoprotein, a component of the viral envelope that decorates the virion surface as a distinctive crown (""corona"") and is essential for SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells, represents a key target for developing therapeutics capable of blocking virus invasion. This review highlights aspects of the SARS-CoV-2 spike biogenesis that may be amenable to host-directed antiviral targeting.","Santopolo, Silvia; Riccio, Anna; Santoro, M Gabriella",Biochem. biophys. res. commun,,192

The strategy during the second wave was to minimize the restrictions set for children. Children spread influenza and therefore simultaneous influenza and COVID-19 surges were feared. The aim of this report is to analyze the epidemiology of influenza season 2020-2021 in Finland. Data for this retrospective register-based study were gathered from the National Infectious Disease Register, all laboratory-confirmed influenza cases from August 2017 to March 2021 were included. The positive influenza findings were stratified by age, and incidences per 100 000 persons were calculated. Only 41 influenza A and B cases have been reported in this season from August 2020 to March 2021, which adds up to an incidence of 0.9 per 100 000 person-years. In the three preceding years, the numbers and corresponding incidences from August to March were 12 461 (282 per 100 000 person-years) in 2019-2020, 15 276 (346 per 100 000 person-years) in 2018-2019, and 33 659 (761 per 100 000 person-years) in 2017-2018. Nonpharmaceutical interventions combined with the lockdown measures interrupted the influenza season in Finland in March 2020. Despite looser restrictions, alongside traveling restrictions and facial masks, failing to prevent the spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 virus, these restrictions have proved to be effective against seasonal influenza.","Kuitunen, Ilari",J. med. virol,,192

In this report, we describe the case of a child with a COVID-19 infection and suffering exclusively from vertigo and fever. Altogether, considering the clinical manifestation, laboratory tests and imaging, given the patient's positivity to SARS-CoV-2 infection and its neurotropic potential, we assumed that the child had COVID-19-induced vestibular neuritis, which, in consideration of the spontaneous improvement of symptoms, did not require any therapeutic adjustments, apart from the natural compensation of the central nervous system.This case suggests the importance of having an index of suspicion for a COVID-19 infection in patients with paediatrics presenting with vertigo and adds valuable information to the limited literature on COVID-19 presentation and management in children.","Giannantonio, Sara; Scorpecci, Alessandro; Montemurri, Berardo; Marsella, Pasquale",BMJ case reports,,192

First, it estimates the 2019 new coronavirus disease (COVID19) flattening curve using Panel Random Coefficient Model. This allows each country to have its trajectory while allowing for random error effects to transfer across countries. Second, it calculates the expected number of days to reach the flattening point of COVID19 curve and estimate the empirical effectiveness of government policies around the world using Poisson regression. This study avails global COVID19 incidence data for 190 countries between January 22, 2020 and May 11, 2020. In the absence of a vaccine or of more appropriate treatment options, non-pharmaceutical approaches must be used to control the spread of the COVID19. This study proposed that the contact tracing, stay at home restrictions and international movement restrictions are most effective in controlling the spread and flattening the COIVD19 curve. At the same time, habits that hurt the immune system like smoking have a negative effect on the flattening of the curve. The government should integrate these policies in their lockdown plan to make it smart lockdown.","Arshed, Noman; Meo, Muhammad Saeed; Farooq, Fatima",J Public Aff,,192

Methods: An online survey of 393 people with lupus was completed through the LUPUS UK website, investigating participants' experiences in maintaining employment. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected. Disease fluctuation, invisibility and fatigue were identified as having substantial negative impacts on employment. This study examined data from a large subgroup (n = 72, 18.74%) of current/previous NHS employees. Descriptive statistics and thematic analysis were used to explore and characterize the demography and experiences of participants. Results: The NHS subgroup (n = 72) represented 18.74% of the whole cohort;100% were female and of working age (18-64 years). Fifty-one were currently (70.8%) and 21 previously (29.2%) NHS employees. Forty-nine (60%) were clinicians. Twenty-one (29.16%) of this working-age subgroup had left any employment. Negative effects of SLE on employment were universal (including an impact on career choices, work disability, enforced part-time working, lower income and early retirement). NHS support for participants to maintain employment was inconsistent, with more negative experiences than positive. The impact of SLE on employment seemed to be poorly understood. Conclusion: A punitive approach to NHS employees with SLE was more common than a proactive, flexible, problem-solving one despite inclusive rhetoric, resulting in the loss of skills and experience to the service. Characterizing conditions such as SLE and long coronavirus disease 2019 as fluctuating, invisible conditions with constitutional symptoms highlights features with negative employment impact, potentially facilitating much-needed change in NHS organizations, with greater use of occupational health, vocational rehabilitation, redeployment and retraining opportunities, highlighting the need for evidence-based employment interventions and improved management of fatigue.","Booth, S.; Price, E.; Walker, E.",Rheumatology Advances in Practice,,192

We hypothesized that participatory design research may support the understanding of stakeholders' situated sense-making in our project, yet, found guidance regarding ML interpretability inexhaustive. Building on philosophy of technology, we formulated explanation strategies as an empirical-analytical lens explicating how technical explanations mediate the contextual preferences concerning people's interpretations.

Healthcare workers (HCW) play a key role in vaccine promotion and patient guidance, and it is likely that hesitancy among this population will have a major impact on the adoption of a successful immunization policy. To investigate HCW attitudes towards anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) vaccination, we developed an anonymous online cross-sectional survey. 1723 Italian HCW responded. Overall, 1155 (67%) intended to be vaccinated, while 443 (26%) were not sure and 125 (7%) declared refusal. In multivariate analysis, factors associated with hesitancy were using Facebook as the main information source and being a non-physician HCW, while predictors of acceptance included younger age, being in close contact with high-risk groups and having received flu vaccination during the 2019-2020 season. Reasons for hesitancy included lack of trust in vaccine safety (85%) and receiving little (78%) or conflicting (69%) information about vaccines. According to our results, adequate investment in vaccine education for healthcare personnel appears to be urgently needed, prioritizing non-physicians and information quality spread through social media. We hope that our data could help governments and policy-makers to target communication in the ongoing COVID-19 vaccination campaign.","Di Gennaro, Francesco; Murri, Rita; Segala, Francesco Vladimiro; Cerruti, Lorenzo; Abdulle, Amina; Saracino, Annalisa; Bavaro, Davide Fiore; Fantoni, Massimo",Viruses,,192

517363,"Comment on ""Aerosol Filtration Efficiency of Common Fabrics Used in Respiratory Cloth Masks""",2020,"BACKGROUND: A large number of web-based COVID-19 symptom checkers and chatbots have been developed; however, anecdotal evidence suggests that their conclusions are highly variable. To our knowledge, no study has evaluated the accuracy of COVID-19 symptom checkers in a statistically rigorous manner. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to evaluate and compare the diagnostic accuracies of web-based COVID-19 symptom checkers. METHODS: We identified 10 web-based COVID-19 symptom checkers, all of which were included in the study. We evaluated the COVID-19 symptom checkers by assessing 50 COVID-19 case reports alongside 410 non-COVID-19 control cases. A bootstrapping method was used to counter the unbalanced sample sizes and obtain confidence intervals (CIs). Results are reported as sensitivity, specificity, F1 score, and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC). RESULTS: The classification task between COVID-19-positive and COVID-19-negative for ""high risk"" cases among the 460 test cases yielded (sorted by F1 score): Symptoma (F1=0.92, MCC=0.85), Infermedica (F1=0.80, MCC=0.61), US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (F1=0.71, MCC=0.30), Babylon (F1=0.70, MCC=0.29), Cleveland Clinic (F1=0.40, MCC=0.07), Providence (F1=0.40, MCC=0.05), Apple (F1=0.29, MCC=-0.10), Docyet (F1=0.27, MCC=0.29), Ada (F1=0.24, MCC=0.27) and Your.MD (F1=0.24, MCC=0.27). For ""high risk"" and ""medium risk"" combined the performance was: Symptoma (F1=0.91, MCC=0.83) Infermedica (F1=0.80, MCC=0.61), Cleveland Clinic (F1=0.76, MCC=0.47), Providence (F1=0.75, MCC=0.45), Your.MD (F1=0.72, MCC=0.33), CDC (F1=0.71, MCC=0.30), Babylon (F1=0.70, MCC=0.29), Apple (F1=0.70, MCC=0.25), Ada (F1=0.42, MCC=0.03), and Docyet (F1=0.27, MCC=0.29). CONCLUSIONS: We found that the number of correctly assessed COVID-19 and control cases varies considerably between symptom checkers, with different symptom checkers showing different strengths with respect to sensitivity and specificity. A good balance between sensitivity and specificity was only achieved by two symptom checkers.","Munsch, Nicolas; Martin, Alistair; Gruarin, Stefanie; Nateqi, Jama; Abdarahmane, Isselmou; Weingartner-Ortner, Rafael; Knapp, Bernhard",J Med Internet Res,,192

The study was addressed to students from the Faculty of Engineering and the Faculty of Physical Education and Sports. The results of survey highlighted that most of students were satisfied with the measures taken by the university during the lockdown period and the way the teaching-learning-assessment process took place. However, some negative aspects were reported as: lack of an adequate infrastructure for some students, less effective teacher-student communication and interaction, impossibility of performing practical applications, lack of socialization, lack of learning motivation, less objective examination (e.g., possibility of cheating), possibility of physical and mental health degradation (e.g., too much time spent in front of screens, installation of a sedentary lifestyle). Consequently, for the new academic year, effective, and efficient measures must be implemented by the management of the university to remove, as much as possible, these negative issues and to improve the performance of online educational process.","Radu, Maria-Crina; Schnakovszky, Carol; Herghelegiu, Eugen; Ciubotariu, Vlad-Andrei; Cristea, Ion",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,192
519132,US health agency will invest $1 billion to investigate 'long COVID',2021,"BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is a newly emerging virus. The antibody response in infected patients remains largely unknown, and the clinical value of antibody testing has not been fully demonstrated. METHODS: 173 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled. Their serial plasma samples (nâ =â 535) collected during hospitalization were tested for total antibodies (Ab), IgM, and IgG against SARS-CoV-2. The dynamics of antibodies with disease progress were analyzed. RESULTS: Among 173 patients, the seroconversion rates for Ab, IgM, and IgG were 93.1%, 82.7%, and 64.7%, respectively. The reason for the negative antibody findings in 12 patients might be due to the lack of blood samples at the later stage of illness. The median seroconversion times for Ab, IgM, and then IgG were days 11, 12, and 4, respectively. The presence of antibodies wasâ <40% among patients within 1 week of onset, and rapidly increased to 100.0% (Ab), 94.3% (IgM), and 79.8% (IgG) by day 15 after onset. In contrast, RNA detectability decreased from 66.7% (58/87) in samples collected before day 7 to 45.5% (25/55) during days 15-39. Combining RNA and antibody detection significantly improved the sensitivity of pathogenic diagnosis for COVID-19 (Pâ <â .001), even in the early phase of 1 week from onset (Pâ =â .007). Moreover, a higher titer of Ab was independently associated with a worse clinical classification (Pâ =â .006). CONCLUSIONS: Antibody detection offers vital clinical information during the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The findings provide strong empirical support for the routine application of serological testing in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 patients.","Zhao, Juanjuan; Yuan, Quan; Wang, Haiyan; Liu, Wei; Liao, Xuejiao; Su, Yingying; Wang, Xin; Yuan, Jing; Li, Tingdong; Li, Jinxiu; Qian, Shen; Hong, Congming; Wang, Fuxiang; Liu, Yingxia; Wang, Zhaoqin; He, Qing; Li, Zhiyong; He, Bin; Zhang, Tianying; Fu, Yang; Ge, Shengxiang; Liu, Lei; Zhang, Jun; Xia, Ningshao; Zhang, Zheng",Clin Infect Dis,,192

519720,On Symmetry and the Reality of Holomorphic Hartree--Fock Wavefunctions,2020-12-22,"Covalent linkages between constituent blocks of macromolecules and ligands have been subject to inconsistent treatment during the model-building, refinement and deposition process. This may stem from a number of sources, including difficulties with initially detecting the covalent linkage, identifying the correct chemistry, obtaining an appropriate restraint dictionary and ensuring its correct application. The analysis presented herein assesses the extent of problems involving covalent linkages in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Not only will this facilitate the remediation of existing models, but also, more importantly, it will inform and thus improve the quality of future linkages. By considering linkages of known type in the CCP4 Monomer Library (CCP4-ML), failure to model a covalent linkage is identified to result in inaccurate (systematically longer) interatomic distances. Scanning the PDB for proximal atom pairs that do not have a corresponding type in the CCP4-ML reveals a large number of commonly occurring types of unannotated potential linkages; in general, these may or may not be covalently linked. Manual consideration of the most commonly occurring cases identifies a number of genuine classes of covalent linkages. The recent expansion of the CCP4-ML is discussed, which has involved the addition of over 16â 000 and the replacement of over 11â 000 component dictionaries using AceDRG. As part of this effort, the CCP4-ML has also been extended using AceDRG link dictionaries for the aforementioned linkage types identified in this analysis. This will facilitate the identification of such linkage types in future modelling efforts, whilst concurrently easing the process involved in their application. The need for a universal standard for maintaining link records corresponding to covalent linkages, and references to the associated dictionaries used during modelling and refinement, following deposition to the PDB is emphasized. The importance of correctly modelling covalent linkages is demonstrated using a case study, which involves the covalent linkage of an inhibitor to the main protease in various viral species, including SARS-CoV-2. This example demonstrates the importance of properly modelling covalent linkages using a comprehensive restraint dictionary, as opposed to just using a single interatomic distance restraint or failing to model the covalent linkage at all.","Nicholls, Robert A; Wojdyr, Marcin; Joosten, Robbie P; Catapano, Lucrezia; Long, Fei; Fischer, Marcus; Emsley, Paul; Murshudov, Garib N",Acta Crystallogr D Struct Biol,,192
521424,Corrigendum,2021,"BACKGROUND: Stroke can lead to varying degrees of oropharyngeal dysphagia, respiratory muscle dysfunction and even increase medical complications such as aspiration, malnutrition and death. Recent studies suggest that inspiratory and expiratory respiratory muscle training (IEMT) can improve swallowing efficacy and may reduce aspiration events. The main purpose of this study is to examine whether an 8-week IEMT programme can improve respiratory muscle strength and swallow dysfunction severity in subacute stroke patients with dysphagia. METHODS: Retornus-2 is a two-arm, prospectively registered, randomized controlled study with blinded assessors and the participation of fifty individuals who have suffered a stroke. The intervention group undergoes IEMT training consisting of 5 sets of 10 repetitions, three times a day for 8 weeks. Training loads increase weekly. The control group undergoes a sham-IEMT protocol. The primary outcome examines the efficacy of the IEMT protocol to increase respiratory muscle strength and reduce dysphagia severity. The secondary outcome assesses the longitudinal impact of dysphagia on body composition and nutritional assessment over a 6-month follow-up. DISCUSSION: IEMT induces an improvement in respiratory muscle strength and might be associated with relevant benefits in dysphagia patterns, as well as a reduction in the number of aspiration events confirmed by videofluoroscopy or fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing. The description of the impact of swallowing impairment on nutritional status will help develop new strategies to face this known side-effect. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT03021252.

521445,"Pandemics, existential and non-existential risks to humanity",2020,"INTRODUCTION: Immunization against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Israel began on December 2020, using the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine. Individuals aged 60 years or older and medical staff were prioritized in COVID-19 immunization, and currently individuals aged 16 years or older are eligible to receive the vaccine. To achieve levels of community immunity (herd immunity) immunization of 60-70% of the population is required. As of mid-February 2021, about 42% of the population in Israel received the first vaccine dose, and the coverage exceeded 70% in individuals aged 50 years or older. Despite this success, the rates of COVID-19 immunization are lower in the ultraorthodox and Arab populations compared to the general Jewish population. We reviewed factors that might affect acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines. Factors that might influence the individual's willingness to be vaccinated against COVID-19 include concerns about the safety of the vaccine, recommendations by employers and treating physicians. Moreover, differences were found in the willingness to be vaccinated according to socio-demographic characteristics, such as employment, age and gender groups, and even political affiliation. Minority populations are vulnerable to misinformation about vaccines. The Arab and the ultraorthodox populations are the main minority groups in Israel, and characterized by lifestyle, and low socio-economic status, which increased, among other factors, the incidence of COVID-19 in these populations. To improve vaccine uptake in the ultraorthodox and Arab populations, there is an urgent need for better tailored solutions to the unique needs of these minority populations, which comprise main risk groups for misinformation related to COVID-19 vaccines. Moreover, a better understanding of the reasons for low uptake of COVID-19 vaccine in these populations is warranted. These activities should be undertaken in parallel to continuous efforts towards reducing socio-economic disparities between sub-population groups.","Ber, I.; Lerman, Y.; Muhsen, K.",Harefuah,,192

The fisheries and shellfishing sectors in Galicia have been significantly affected due to the measures taken to curb the pandemic. In particular, the closure of the HORECA channel and the confinement of the population have adversely affected the production of fresh fish and shellfish. In this study, a three-stage analysis of the management of the pandemic in Spain has been carried out (confinement, ""new normality"" and closure of the HORECA channel). The direct and indirect effects of the pandemic have been considered, as well as other factors independent of it, which usually influence production. The results show a decrease in catches, revenue and average price (euros/kg) at first sale of Galician fish and shellfish products over the three study periods, with an incidence level that varies between phases, species, fleet segments and sectors.","Fernández-González, Raquel; Pérez-Pérez, Marcos I; Pérez-Vas, Raisa",Mar Pollut Bull,,192

Moreover, the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) relative to vaccination in rural areas is uncertain. We addressed this knowledge gap through using an improved statistical stochastic method based on the Galton-Watson branching process, considering both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases. Data included 1136 SARS-2-CoV infections of the rural outbreak in Hebei, China, and 135 infections of the urban outbreak in Tianjin, China. We reconstructed SARS-CoV-2 transmission chains and analyzed the effectiveness of vaccination and NPIs by simulation studies. The transmission of SARS-CoV-2 showed strong heterogeneity in urban and rural areas, with the dispersion parameters k = 0.14 and 0.35, respectively (k < 1 indicating strong heterogeneity). Although age group and contact-type distributions significantly differed between urban and rural areas, the average reproductive number (R) and k did not. Further, simulation results based on pre-control parameters (R = 0.81, k = 0.27) showed that in the vaccination scenario (80% efficacy and 55% coverage), the cumulative secondary infections will be reduced by more than half; however, NPIs are more effective than vaccinating 65% of the population. These findings could inform government policies regarding vaccination and NPIs in rural and urban areas.","Li, Yuying; Hu, Taojun; Gai, Xin; Zhang, Yunjun; Zhou, Xiaohua",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,192

Indeed, there is urgent need to develop and deploy robust diagnostic methodologies not only to use in health laboratory environments but also directly in places where humans circulate and spread the virus such as airports, trains, boats, and any public aggregation places. The success of a reliable and sensitive asymptomatic diagnosis relies on the identification and measurement of informative biomarkers from human host and virus in a rapid, sensitive, and inexpensive manner. The objective of this article is to describe an innovative multidisciplinary approach to develop an efficient, inexpensive, and easy-to-use portable instrument (bCUBE® by Hyris Ltd) that can be employed as a surveillance system for the emergency caused by SARS-CoV-2. A solution for Coronavirus testing, compliant with CDC guidelines, is scheduled to be released in the next weeks. In addition, we will describe a workflow and path of an integrated multi-omic approach that will lead to host and pathogen biomarker discovery in order to train the instrument to provide reliable results based on a specific biomarker's fingerprint of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Martinelli, Federico; Perrone, Anna; Della Noce, Isabella; Colombo, Lorenzo; Lo Priore, Stefano; Romano, Simone",Immunol Rev,,192

Studies have shown that coronavirus can cause neurological symptoms, but clinical studies on its neurological symptoms are limited. In this meta-analysis, we aimed to summarize the various neurological manifestations that occurred in COVID-19 patients and calculate the incidence of various neurological manifestations. At the same time, we further explored the mechanism of nervous system injury and prognosis in COVID-19 patients in combination with their nervous system manifestations. This study provides a reference for early clinical identification of COVID-19 nervous system injury in the future, so as to achieve early treatment and reduce neurological sequelae. METHODS: We systematically searched all published English literature related to the neurological manifestations of COVID-19 from January 1, 2020, to April 30, 2021, in Pubmed, Embase, and Cochrane Library. The keywords used were COVID-19 and terminology related to the nervous system performance. All included studies were selected by two independent reviewers using EndNote and NoteExpress software, any disagreement was resolved by consensus or by a third reviewer, and the selected data were then collected for meta-analysis using a random-effects model. RESULTS: A total of 168 articles (n = 292,693) were included in the study, and the meta-analysis showed that the most common neurological manifestations of COVID-19 were myalgia(33%; 95%CI 0.30–0.37; I(2) = 99.17%), smell impairment(33%; 95%CI 0.28–0.38; I(2) = 99.40%), taste dysfunction(33%; 95%CI 0.27–0.39; I(2) = 99.09%), altered mental status(32%; 95%CI 0.22–0.43; I(2) = 99.06%), headache(29%; 95%CI 0.25–0.33; I(2) = 99.42%), encephalopathy(26%; 95%CI 0.16–0.38; I(2) = 99.31%), alteration of consciousness(13%; 95%CI 0.08–0.19; I(2) = 98.10%), stroke(12%; 95%CI 0.08–0.16; I(2) = 98.95%), dizziness(10%; 95%CI 0.08–0.13; I(2) = 96.45%), vision impairment(6%; 95%CI 0.03–0.09; I(2) = 86.82%), intracerebral haemorrhage(5%; 95%CI 0.03–0.09; I(2) = 95.60%), seizure(4%; 95%CI 0.02 -0.05; I(2) = 98.15%), encephalitis(2%; 95%CI 0.01–0.03; I(2) = 90.36%), Guillan-Barré Syndrome (GBS) (1%; 95%CI 0.00–0.03; I(2) = 89.48%).

Our findings are based on the analysis of 232 survey results, where we tested the effects of AI adoption on workers’ psychological contract, engagement and trust. We find that psychological contracts had a significant, positive effect on job engagement and on trust. Yet, with AI adoption, the positive effect of psychological contracts fell significantly. A further re-examination of the extant literature leads us to posit that AI adoption fosters the creation of a third type of psychological contract, which we term “Alienational”. Whereas SDG 8 is premised on strengthening relational contracts between an organization and its employees, the adoption of AI has the opposite effect, detracting from the very nature of decent work.","Braganza, Ashley; Chen, Weifeng; Canhoto, Ana; Sap, Serap",J Bus Res,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S014829632030518X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbusres.2020.08.018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32836565/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S014829632030518X,192

Four compounds bortezomib, dactolisib, alvocidib and methotrexate inhibited the formation of virus infection-induced cytopathic effect in Vero E6 cells at 1 μM, yet such a concentration seems toxic to the cells as well. While the evaluation in other permissive cells and the prediction of toxicity are needed to optimize and minimize their antiviral activity and cytotoxicity, respectively, this computational approach has the potential to rapidly and rationally identify drug candidates against COVID-19.","Xing, Jing; Shankar, Rama; Drelich, Aleksandra; Paithankar, Shreya; Chekalin, Eugene; Dexheimer, Thomas; Rajasekaran, Surender; Tseng, Chien-Te Kent; Chen, Bin",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.07.030734; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32511305/,192

We examined whether COVID-19 risk differs according to antihypertensive drug class in patients treated by ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) compared with calcium channel blockers (CCBs). Three exclusive cohorts of prevalent ACE inhibitors, ARB and CCB users, aged 18 to 80 years, from the French National Health Insurance databases were followed from February 15, 2020 to June 7, 2020. We excluded patients with a history of diabetes, known cardiovascular disease, chronic renal failure, or chronic respiratory disease during the previous 5 years, to only consider patients treated for uncomplicated hypertension and to limit indication bias. The primary end point was time to hospitalization for COVID-19. The secondary end point was time to intubation/death during a hospital stay for COVID-19. In a population of almost 2 million hypertensive patients (ACE inhibitors: 566 023; ARB: 958 227; CCB: 358 306) followed for 16 weeks, 2338 were hospitalized and 526 died or were intubated for COVID-19. ACE inhibitors and ARBs were associated with a lower risk of COVID-19 hospitalization compared with CCBs (hazard ratio, 0.74 [95% CI, 0.65–0.83] and 0.84 [0.76–0.93], respectively) and a lower risk of intubation/death. Risks were slightly lower for ACE inhibitor users than for ARB users. This large observational study may suggest a lower COVID-19 risk in hypertensive patients treated over a long period with ACE inhibitors or ARBs compared with CCBs. These results, if confirmed, tend to contradict previous hypotheses and raise new hypotheses.","Semenzato, Laura; Botton, Jérémie; Drouin, Jérôme; Baricault, Bérangère; Vabre, Clémentine; Cuenot, François; Penso, Laetitia; Herlemont, Philippe; Sbidian, Emilie; Weill, Alain; Dray-Spira, Rosemary; Zureik, Mahmoud",Hypertension,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33423528/; https://doi.org/10.1161/hypertensionaha.120.16314,192

In this paper, a hybrid neural network is proposed, named CovTANet, to provide an end-to-end clinical diagnostic tool for early diagnosis, lesion segmentation, and severity prediction of COVID-19 utilizing chest computer tomography (CT) scans. A multi-phase optimization strategy is introduced for solving the challenges of complicated diagnosis at a very early stage of infection, where an efficient lesion segmentation network is optimized initially which is later integrated into a joint optimization framework for the diagnosis and severity prediction tasks providing feature enhancement of the infected regions. Moreover, for overcoming the challenges with diffused, blurred, and varying shaped edges of COVID lesions with novel and diverse characteristics, a novel segmentation network is introduced, namely Tri-level Attention-based Segmentation Network (TA-SegNet). This network has significantly reduced semantic gaps in subsequent encoding decoding stages, with immense parallelization of multi-scale features for faster convergence providing considerable performance improvement over traditional networks. Furthermore, a novel tri-level attention mechanism has been introduced, which is repeatedly utilized over the network, combining channel, spatial, and pixel attention schemes for faster and efficient generalization of contextual information embedded in the feature map through feature re-calibration and enhancement operations. Outstanding performances have been achieved in all three-tasks through extensive experimentation on a large publicly available dataset containing 1110 chest CT-volumes that signifies the effectiveness of the proposed scheme at the current stage of the pandemic.","Mahmud, Tanvir; Alam, Md.

It is well established that porcine intestinal epithelium is the target of the TGEV infection, however the mechanism that TGEV invades the host epithelium remains largely unknown. Aminopeptidase N (APN) is a known receptor of TGEV. This study discovered that the extracellular receptor binding domain 1 pertaining to epidermal growth receptor (EGFR) interact with TGEV spike protein. APN and EGFR synergistically promote TGEV invasion. TGEV promotes APN and EGFR clustering early in infection. Furthermore APN and EGFR synergistically stimulate PI3K/AKT as well as MEK/ERK1/2 endocytosis signaling pathways. TGEV entry is via clathrin and caveolin mediated endocytosis in IPEC-J2 cells. TGEV binds with EGFR, and subsequently promotes EGFR internalization by a clathrin-mediated endocytosis pathway.

597527,Developing-country vaccine manufacturers’ technical capabilities can make a difference in global immunization,2021-08-03,"Since its emergence in late 2019, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a pandemic with more than 55 million reported cases and 1.3 million estimated deaths worldwide. While epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 have been reported, risk factors underlying the transition from mild to severe disease among patients remain poorly understood. In this retrospective study, we analysed data of 879 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive patients admitted to a two-site NHS Trust hospital in London, England, between January 1st and May 26th, 2020, with a majority of cases occurring in March and April. We extracted anonymised demographic data, physiological clinical variables and laboratory results from electronic healthcare records (EHR) and applied multivariate logistic regression, random forest and extreme gradient boosted trees. To evaluate the potential for early risk assessment, we used data available during patients’ initial presentation at the emergency department (ED) to predict deterioration to one of three clinical endpoints in the remainder of the hospital stay: admission to intensive care, need for invasive mechanical ventilation and in-hospital mortality. Based on the trained models, we extracted the most informative clinical features in determining these patient trajectories. Considering our inclusion criteria, we have identified 129 of 879 (15%) patients that required intensive care, 62 of 878 (7%) patients needing mechanical ventilation, and 193 of 619 (31%) cases of in-hospital mortality. Our models learned successfully from early clinical data and predicted clinical endpoints with high accuracy, the best model achieving area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC-ROC) scores of 0.76 to 0.87 (F1 scores of 0.42–0.60). Younger patient age was associated with an increased risk of receiving intensive care and ventilation, but lower risk of mortality. Clinical indicators of a patient’s oxygen supply and selected laboratory results, such as blood lactate and creatinine levels, were most predictive of COVID-19 patient trajectories. Among COVID-19 patients machine learning can aid in the early identification of those with a poor prognosis, using EHR data collected during a patient’s first presentation at ED. Patient age and measures of oxygenation status during ED stay are primary indicators of poor patient outcomes.","Heldt, Frank S.; Vizcaychipi, Marcela P.; Peacock, Sophie; Cinelli, Mattia; McLachlan, Lachlan; Andreotti, Fernando; Jovanović, Stojan; Dürichen, Robert; Lipunova, Nadezda; Fletcher, Robert A.; Hancock, Anne; McCarthy, Alex; Pointon, Richard A.; Brown, Alexander; Eaton, James; Liddi, Roberto; Mackillop, Lucy; Tarassenko, Lionel; Khan, Rabia T.",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33603086/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-83784-y,192

However, the management of these two conditions has rarely been discussed. We aimed to describe the clinical outcomes of pleural drainage in critically ill patients with COVID-19. METHODS: A total of 17 pleural drainages were performed in 11 critically ill patients with pneumothorax or hydrothorax. Either chest tubes or central venous catheters (CVCs) were used. The clinical outcomes, including respiratory and circulation indicators at 24 h and 1 h before the procedure and 24 h and 48 h after the procedure, were retrospectively recorded. RESULTS: (1) Following pleural drainage, there was a 19.1% improvement in the PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio from 147.4 mmHg (-1 h) to 175.5 mmHg (24 h), while the mean positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) decreased from 10.7 cmH(2)O (-1 h) to 8.9 cmH(2)O (24 h) and 8.1 cmH(2)O (48 h). The A-a gradients decreased from 313.3 mmHg (-1 h) to 261.3 mmHg (24 h). (2) The dosage of norepinephrine increased from 0.15 μg/kg/min (-1 h) to 0.40 μg/kg/min (24 h). (3) No haemorrhagic or infectious complications were observed. (4) A total of 41.6% of CVCs were partially or fully obstructed, while no chest tubes were obstructed. CONCLUSION: For critically ill patients with COVID-19, pleural drainage leads to a significant improvement in oxygenation and gas exchange, but the deterioration of circulation is not reversed. It is safe to perform pleural drainage even though anticoagulation therapy and glucocorticoids are widely used. Chest tubes rather than CVCs are recommended.","Xu, Yuan; Li, Shanqing; Liu, Hongsheng",Heart Lung,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147956320304684; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33310504/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hrtlng.2020.12.007; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0147956320304684,192

Several groups have described loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assays for SARS-CoV-2, including testing directly from nasopharyngeal swabs and eliminating the need for reagents in short supply. Frequent surveillance of individuals attending work or school is currently unavailable to most people but will likely be necessary to reduce the ~50% of transmission that occurs when individuals are nonsymptomatic. Here we describe a fluorescence-based RT-LAMP test using direct nasopharyngeal swab samples and show consistent detection in clinically confirmed primary samples with a limit of detection (LOD) of ~625 copies/μl, approximately 100-fold lower sensitivity than qRT-PCR. While less sensitive than extraction-based molecular methods, RT-LAMP without RNA extraction is fast and inexpensive. Here we also demonstrate that adding a lysis buffer directly into the RT-LAMP reaction improves the sensitivity of some samples by approximately 10-fold. Furthermore, purified RNA in this assay achieves a similar LOD to qRT-PCR. These results indicate that high-throughput RT-LAMP testing could augment qRT-PCR in SARS-CoV-2 surveillance programs, especially while the availability of qRT-PCR testing and RNA extraction reagents is constrained.","Dudley, Dawn M.; Newman, Christina M.; Weiler, Andrea M.; Ramuta, Mitchell D.; Shortreed, Cecilia G.; Heffron, Anna S.; Accola, Molly A.; Rehrauer, William M.; Friedrich, Thomas C.; O’Connor, David H.",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0244882; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33382861/,192

Despite the decades-long use of HCQ in the treatment of diseases, such as malaria and autoimmune disorders, the exact mechanisms of action of this drug are only beginning to be understood. To date, no data are available on the genotoxic potential of HCQ in vitro or in vivo. The present study is the first investigation of the DNA damaging- and mutagenic effects of HCQ in mammalian cells in vitro, at concentrations that are comparable to clinically achievable doses in patient populations. We demonstrate significant induction of a representative oxidative DNA damage (8-oxodG) in primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) treated with HCQ at 5 and 25 μM concentrations (P = 0.020 and P = 0.029, respectively), as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Furthermore, we show significant mutagenicity of HCQ, manifest as 2.2- and 1.8-fold increases in relative cII mutant frequency in primary and spontaneously immortalized Big Blue® MEFs, respectively, treated with 25 μM dose of this drug (P = 0.005 and P = 0.012, respectively). The observed genotoxic effects of HCQ in vitro, achievable at clinically relevant doses, are novel and important, and may have significant implications for safety monitoring in patient populations.

599663,Luminescence literature,2004-07-27,"The COVID-19 pandemic placed public health measures against infectious diseases at the core of global health challenges, especially in cities where more than half of the global population lives. SARS-CoV-2 is an exposure agent recently added to the network of exposures that comprise the human exposome, i.e. the totality of all environmental exposures throughout one’s lifetime. At the same time, the application of measures to tackle SARS-CoV-2 transmission leads to changes in the exposome components and in characteristics of urban environments that define the urban exposome, a complementary concept to the human exposome, which focuses on monitoring urban health. This work highlights the use of a comprehensive systems-based approach of the exposome for better capturing the population-wide and individual-level variability in SARS-CoV-2 spread and its associated urban and individual exposures towards improved guidance and response. Population characteristics, the built environment and spatiotemporal features of city infrastructure, as well as individual characteristics/parameters, socioeconomic status, occupation and biological susceptibility need to be simultaneously considered when deploying non-pharmacological public health measures. Integrating individual and population characteristics, as well as urban-specific parameters is the prerequisite in urban exposome studies. Applications of the exposome approach in cities/towns could facilitate assessment of health disparities and better identification of vulnerable populations, as framed by multiple environmental, urban design and planning co-exposures. Exposome-based applications in epidemics control and response include the implementation of exposomic tools that have been quite mature in non-communicable disease research, ranging from biomonitoring and surveillance to sensors and modeling. Therefore, the exposome can be a novel tool in risk assessment and management during epidemics and other major public health events. This is a unique opportunity for the research community to exploit the exposome concept and its tools in upgrading and further developing site-specific public health measures in cities.","Andrianou, Xanthi D.; Pronk, Anjoeka; Galea, Karen S.; Stierum, Rob; Loh, Miranda; Riccardo, Flavia; Pezzotti, Patrizio; Makris, Konstantinos C.",Environ Int,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2020.106246; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412020322017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33181410/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0160412020322017,192

The experience of the 1918 influenza pandemic demonstrated that decreases in the infection rates of COVID-19 do not guarantee continuity of the trend. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop a precise spread model of COVID-19 with time-dependent parameters via deep learning to respond promptly to the dynamic situation of the outbreak and proactively minimize damage. METHODS: In this study, we investigated a mathematical model with time-dependent parameters via deep learning based on forward-inverse problems. We used data from the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) and the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University for Korea and the other countries, respectively. Because the data consist of confirmed, recovered, and deceased cases, we selected the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model and found approximated solutions as well as model parameters. Specifically, we applied fully connected neural networks to the solutions and parameters and designed suitable loss functions. RESULTS: We developed an entirely new SIR model with time-dependent parameters via deep learning methods. Furthermore, we validated the model with the conventional Runge-Kutta fourth order model to confirm its convergent nature. In addition, we evaluated our model based on the real-world situation reported from the KCDC, the Korean government, and news media. We also crossvalidated our model using data from the CSSE for Italy, Sweden, and the United States. CONCLUSIONS: The methodology and new model of this study could be employed for short-term prediction of COVID-19, which could help the government prepare for a new outbreak. In addition, from the perspective of measuring medical resources, our model has powerful strength because it assumes all the parameters as time-dependent, which reflects the exact status of viral spread.","Jung, Se Young; Jo, Hyeontae; Son, Hwijae; Hwang, Hyung Ju",J Med Internet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32877350/; https://doi.org/10.2196/19907,192

Rapid antigen detection tests have been developed and many have received regulatory acceptance such as CE IVD or FDA markings. Their performance needs to be carefully assessed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 158 positive and 40 negative retrospective samples collected in saline and analyzed by a laboratory-developed RT-PCR test were used to evaluate Sofia (Quidel), Standard Q (SD Biosensor), and Panbio™ (Abbott) rapid antigen detection tests (RADTs). A subset of the specimens was subjected to virus culture. RESULTS: The specificity of all RADTs was 100% and the sensitivity and percent agreement was 80% and 85% for Sofia, 81% and 85% for Standard Q, and 83% and 86% for Panbio™, respectively. All three RADTs evaluated in this study reached a more than 90% sensitivity for samples with a high viral load as estimated from the low Ct (Cycle threshold) values in the reference RT-PCR. Virus culture was successful in 80% of specimens with a Ct value <25. CONCLUSIONS: As expected, the RADTs were less sensitive than RT-PCR. However, they benefit from the speed and ease of testing, and lower price as compared to RT-PCR.

603123,Chapter 6 Bat Rabies,2013-12-31,"With the arrival of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, the scientific academia, as well as policymakers, are striving to conceive solutions as an attempt to contain the spreading of contagion. Among the adopted measures, severe lockdown restrictions were issued to avoid the diffusion of the virus in an uncontrolled way through public spaces. It can be deduced from recent literature that the primary route of transmission is via aerosols, produced mainly in poorly ventilated interior areas where infected people spend a lot of time with other people. Concerning contagion rates, accumulated incidence or number of hospitalizations due to COVID-19, Spain, and Italy have reached very high levels. In this framework, a regression analysis to assess the feasibility of the indoor ventilation measures established in Spain and Italy, with respect to the European framework, is here presented. To this aim, ten cases of housing typology were and analyzed. The results show that the measures established in the applicable regulations to prevent and control the risk of contagion by aerosols are not adequate to guarantee a healthy environment indoors. The current Italian guidelines are more restrictive than in Spain, yet the ventilation levels are still insufficient in times of pandemic.","Lepore, Ester; Aguilera Benito, Patricia; Piña Ramírez, Carolina; Viccione, Giacomo",Sustain Cities Soc,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2210670721003358; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scs.2021.103051; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670721003358?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34099968/,192

Apart from suggesting an approach for estimating completeness of reporting at a sub-national level, the application produces estimates of the number of deaths in excess of those expected in the absence of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic that are highly correlated with the confirmed number of COVID-19 deaths over time, but at a level 2.5 to 3 times higher than the official numbers of COVID-19 deaths. Apportioning the observed excess deaths more precisely to COVID, COVID-related and collateral deaths, and non-COVID deaths averted by interventions with reduced mobility and gatherings, etc., requires access to real-time cause-of-death information. It is suggested that the transition from ICD-10 to ICD-11 should be used as an opportunity to change from a paper-based system to electronic capture of the medical cause-of-death information.","Dorrington, Rob E.; Moultrie, Tom A.; Laubscher, Ria; Groenewald, Pam J.; Bradshaw, Debbie",Genus,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34493876/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s41118-021-00134-6,192

603937,2021 ASCO Virtual Annual Meeting.,2021-06-10,"INTRODUCTION: Globally, India has the third largest population of people living with HIV (PLHIV) and the second highest number of COVID-19 cases. Anxiety is associated with antiretroviral therapy (ART) nonadherence. It is crucial to understand the burden of anxiety and its sources among Asian Indian PLHIV during the COVID pandemic, but data are limited. METHODS: During the first month of government mandated lockdown, we administered an anxiety assessment via telephone among PLHIV registered for care at a publicly funded antiretroviral therapy (ART) center in Pune, India. Generalized anxiety was defined as GAD-7 score ≥ 10. Sociodemographic and clinical variables were compared by anxiety status (GAD-7 score ≥ 10 vs GAD-7 score < 10). Qualitative responses to an open-ended question about causes of concern were evaluated using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Among 167 PLHIV, median age was 44 years (IQR 40–50); the majority were cisgender women (60%) and had a monthly family income < 200 USD (81%). Prior history of tuberculosis and other comorbidities were observed in 38 and 27%, respectively. Overall, prevalence of generalized anxiety was 25% (n = 41). PLHIV with GAD-7 score ≥ 10 had fewer remaining doses of ART than those with lower GAD-7 scores (p = 0.05). Thematic analysis indicated that concerns were both health related and unrelated, and stated temporally. Present concerns were often also projected as future concerns. CONCLUSIONS: The burden of anxiety was high during COVID lockdown in our population of socioeconomically disadvantaged PLHIV in Pune and appeared to be influenced by concerns about ART availability. The burden of anxiety among PLHIV will likely increase with the worsening pandemic in India, as sources of anxiety are expected to persist. We recommend the regular use of short screening tools for anxiety to monitor and triage patients as an extension of current HIV services.","Marbaniang, Ivan; Sangle, Shashikala; Nimkar, Smita; Zarekar, Kanta; Salvi, Sonali; Chavan, Amol; Gupta, Amita; Suryavanshi, Nishi; Mave, Vidya",BMC Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33097028/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-020-09656-8,192
604277,"Improving the large scale purification of the HIV microbicide, griffithsin",2015-02-22,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has increased psychological stress among adolescents, and the relation between perceived stress (PS) and psychotic-like experiences (PLEs) has been well-established. However, little is known about the role of family functioning (FF) in this relation, especially when adolescents experienced the extended lockdown period with family members. METHODS: A total of 4807 adolescents completed this retrospective paper-and-pencil survey after school reopening between May 14th and June 6th, 2020 in Hunan Province, China. We measured PS with the Perceived stress scale (PSS-10), PLEs with the eight positive items from Community Assessment of Psychic Experiences (CAPE-8), and FF with the Family APGAR scale. We conducted subgroup analysis based on three FF levels (good, moderate, and poor) determined by previous studies. Finally, correlation and moderation analysis were performed to detect the effect of FF in the relation between PS and PLEs after adjusting for demographic variables. RESULTS: Adolescents with poor FF had higher levels of PS and higher prevalence of PLEs compared to those with good FF (both p < 0.001). FF was negatively associated with both PS (r = −0.34, p < 0.001) and PLEs (r = −0.29, p < 0.001). Higher FF significantly attenuated the effect of PS on PLEs after adjusting for sex and age (effect = −0.011, bootstrap 95% CI -0.018, −0.005). CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that well-functioned family could protect against stress-induced PLEs among adolescents during this crisis. Thus family system could be an early interventional target for distressing psychotic-like experiences in youngsters.","Wu, Zhipeng; Zou, Zhulin; Wang, Feiwen; Xiang, Zhibiao; Zhu, Mengran; Long, Yicheng; Tao, Haojuan; Palaniyappan, Lena; Liu, Zhening",Compr Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34560369/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010440X21000523?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0010440X21000523; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.comppsych.2021.152274,192

The trajectories of gratitude and the importance of social media for meaningful conversations with friends—but not frequency of social media use—were positively associated over time. At the within‐person level, gratitude predicted increased importance of social media for meaningful conversations, but not vice‐versa.

Due to the low sensitivity of the reverse transcriptase‐polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) test, chest computed tomography (CT) imaging is being used for COVID‐19 diagnostic correlation and to evaluate whether there is pneumonic involvement in the lung. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to investigate the correlation between lung changes on CT and QTc interval changes on ECG in non‐ICU patients with COVID‐19 who have a positive PCR test when using drugs that can prolong the QTc interval. METHODS: This was a single‐centre retrospective cohort study of hospitalized non‐ICU patients. The study included 344 patients (56.1% men) with a mean age of 46.34 ± 17.68 years. The patients were divided into four groups according to their chest CT results: those having typical, atypical, indeterminate, or no pneumonic involvement. The mean QTc intervals and heart rates calculated from electrocardiograms (ECG) during admission to the hospital and after the treatment were compared. RESULTS: No significant differences were found between the groups’ age, gender, and body mass index (BMI). In addition, no significant differences were found between the groups’ mean QTc interval values at admission (P:.127) or after the treatment (P:.205). The groups’ heart rate values were also similar, with no significant differences in the mean heart rate on admission (P:.648) and post‐treatment (P:.229) ECGs. CONCLUSION: This study has demonstrated findings of COVID‐19 infection based on chest CT does not correlate with QT interval prolongation in non‐ICU COVID‐19 patients. There is a need for additional larger studies investigating the effect of chest CT findings on QT interval prolongation and bradycardia in COVID‐19 patients.","Ozyurtlu, Ferhat; Cetin, Nurullah; Yavuz, Veysel",Int J Clin Pract,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34185352/; https://doi.org/10.1111/ijcp.14583,192

We analyzed 219 camel and human MERS-CoV genome sequences available in GenBank. Phylogenetic analysis showed that 5 and 214 strains belong to clade A and B, respectively, with clade A further divided into lineage A1 (3 human strains) and lineage A2 (2 camel strains), and clade B divided into B1 to B6 (each containing both human and camel strains). Recombination analysis showed potential recombination events in five strains from dromedaries in Saudi Arabia, with recombination between lineage B5 and B3 in four strains, and between lineage B3 and B4 in one strain. The spike protein showed the highest number of amino acid substitutions, especially between A2 and other lineages, and contained positively selected codons. Notably, codon 1020 was positively selected among B and B5 strains, and can distinguish between clade A (Q1020) and B (R1020/H1020) strains, suggesting that this residue may play a role in the evolution of S protein during divergence of different lineages. The time of the most recent common ancestor of all MERS-CoV was dated to approximately 2010. The implications on the role of camels in the evolution of MERS-CoV are discussed.","Lau, Susanna K.

RECENT FINDINGS: As shown in recent publications and in our original data, specific autoantibodies may be functionally relevant to COVID-19 infection. We evaluated sera from 35 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 to identify antinuclear antibodies and autoantibodies directed against specific antigenic targets, and we identified anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) in 20/35 of patients with COVID-19 (57%), in patients with need for supplemental oxygen (90% vs. 20% in ANA-negative cases; Pâ<â0.0001).

They confronted a diverse range of stressors both as survivors and as relief workers; however, little is known about their longitudinal PTSD symptoms. METHODS: The participants were 745 local municipality and hospital medical workers [average age: 43.6 ± 9.5 years, range: 20 – 66 years; 306 (59%) women] involved in disaster recovery duties following the GEJE. PTSD symptoms were measured using the Japanese version of the PTSD Checklist Specific Version (PCL-S) at four time points: 14, 30, 43, and 54 months after the GEJE. Using group-based trajectory modeling, distinct trajectories were elucidated. RESULTS: We identified five distinct PTSD symptoms profiles: resistance (n = 467, 62.7%), subsyndromal (n = 181, 24.3%), recovery (n = 47, 6.3%), fluctuating (n = 26, 3.5%), and chronic (n = 24, 3.2%). The trajectories differed according to the post-disaster working conditions and personal disaster experiences. LIMITATIONS: Potential selection bias resulting from the limited number of participants who completed all waves. The survey was conducted in one region of the disaster area.

Methods: We employed geospatial and quantitative analyses using data on fast food outlets (from surveys conducted between November 2019 and May 2020) and educational facilities in Riyadh city. Data analyses conducted using ArcMap 10.6 and Stata 15 compared the density within 500 m and 500–1000 m from the facilities. Results: We found a high density of fast food outlets around educational facilities. Nearly 80% of fast food were within twelve-minute walking or five-minute driving distances from schools, and nearly 70% of all educational facilities had at least one fast food outlet within the buffer. We also found the densities were high within both the areas closer and the areas farther away from educational facilities. In addition, the density was significantly higher around private schools compared to government schools, and the density around girls-only schools and both-gender schools was higher than that around boys-only schools. Conclusion: There is a high density of fast food outlets around educational facilities in Saudi Arabia.

Spike binding and neutralization against all three VOCs were substantially reduced in most individuals, with the largest four- to sevenfold reduction in neutralization being observed against B.1.351. While hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and vaccinees maintained sufficient neutralizing titers against all three VOCs, 39% of nonhospitalized patients exhibited no detectable neutralization against B.1.351. Moreover, monoclonal neutralizing antibodies show sharp reductions in their binding kinetics and neutralizing potential to B.1.351 and P.1 but not to B.1.1.7. These data have implications for the degree to which pre-existing immunity can protect against subsequent infection with VOCs and informs policy makers of susceptibility to globally circulating SARS-CoV-2 VOCs.","Caniels, Tom G.; Bontjer, Ilja; van der Straten, Karlijn; Poniman, Meliawati; Burger, Judith A.; Appelman, Brent; Lavell, H.

SARS-CoV-2 can remain infectious on surfaces for up to several weeks; therefore, proper disinfection is required to mitigate the risk of indirect virus spreading. Gaseous ozone treatment has received particular attention as an easily accessible disinfection tool. In this study, we evaluated the virucidal effectiveness of gaseous ozone treatment (>7.3 ppm, 2 h) on murine hepatitis virus (MHV)-contaminated stainless-steel surface and PBS-suspended virus under field conditions at ambient (21.8%) and high (49.8–54.2%) relative humidity. Surficial virus was soiled with 0.3 g/L of BSA. Parallelly, a half-hour vaporization with 7.3% hydrogen peroxide was performed on contaminated carriers. The obtained results showed that gaseous ozone, whilst quite effective against suspended virus, was insufficient in sanitizing coronavirus contaminated surfaces, especially under low RH. Increased humidity created more favorable conditions for MHV inactivation, resulting in 2.1 log titre reduction. Vaporization with 7.3% hydrogen peroxide presented much better virucidal performance than ozonation in a similar experimental setup, indicating that its application may be more advantageous regarding gaseous disinfection of surfaces contaminated with other coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2.","Mazur-Panasiuk, Natalia; Botwina, Pawel; Kutaj, Adrian; Woszczyna, Damian; Pyrc, Krzysztof",Antioxidants (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34573110/; https://doi.org/10.3390/antiox10091480,192

611829,To our readers: Important notice,2020-07-10,"Ultrafine particles (UFP; particulate matter <0.1 μm diameter) emitted from motorized traffic may be highly detrimental to health. Active mobility (walking, bicycling) is increasingly encouraged as a way to reduce traffic congestion and increase physical activity levels. However, it has raised concerns of increased exposure to UFP, due to increased breathing rates in traffic microenvironments, immediately close to their source. The recent Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) societal closures reduced commuting needs, allowing a natural experiment to estimate contributions from motorized traffic to UFP exposure while walking or bicycling. From late-March to mid-July 2020, UFP was repeatedly measured while walking or bicycling, capturing local COVID-19 closure (‘Phase 0’) and subsequent phased re-opening (‘Phase 1, 2, 2.1 & 3’). A DiSCmini continuously measured particle number concentration (PNC) in the walker/bicyclist’s breathing zone. PNC while walking or bicycling was compared across phased re-openings and the effect of ambient temperature, wind speed and direction, was determined using regression models. Approximately 40 repeated 20-minute walking and bicycling laps were made over 4 months during societal re-opening phases related to the COVID-19 pandemic, from late March to mid July 2020 in Copenhagen. Highest median PNC exposure of both walking (13,170 pt/cm3, standard deviation (SD): 3560 pt/cm3) and bicycling (21,477 pt/cm3, SD: 8964) was seen during societal closures (Phase 0) and decreased to 5,367 pt/cm3 (SD: 2949) and 8,714 pt/cm3 (SD: 4309) in Phase 3 of re-opening. These reductions in PNC were mainly explained by meteorological conditions, with most of the deviation explained by wind speed (14–22%) and temperature (13–10%). Highest PNC was observed along major roads and intersections. In conclusion, we observed decreases in UFP exposure while walking and bicycling during societal re-opening phases related to the COVID-19 pandemic, due largely to meteorological factors (e.g., wind speed and temperature) and seasonal variations in UFP levels.","Bergmann, M.

612105,An overview of filtration efficiency through the masks: Mechanisms of the aerosols penetration,2021-01-31,"The capability of generalization to unseen domains is crucial for deep learning models when considering real-world scenarios. However, current available medical image datasets, such as those for COVID-19 CT images, have large variations of infections and domain shift problems. To address this issue, we propose a prior knowledge driven domain adaptation and a dual-domain enhanced self-correction learning scheme. Based on the novel learning schemes, a domain adaptation based self-correction model (DASC-Net) is proposed for COVID-19 infection segmentation on CT images. DASC-Net consists of a novel attention and feature domain enhanced domain adaptation model (AFD-DA) to solve the domain shifts and a self-correction learning process to refine segmentation results. The innovations in AFD-DA include an image-level activation feature extractor with attention to lung abnormalities and a multi-level discrimination module for hierarchical feature domain alignment. The proposed self-correction learning process adaptively aggregates the learned model and corresponding pseudo labels for the propagation of aligned source and target domain information to alleviate the overfitting to noises caused by pseudo labels. Extensive experiments over three publicly available COVID-19 CT datasets demonstrate that DASC-Net consistently outperforms state-of-the-art segmentation, domain shift, and coronavirus infection segmentation methods. Ablation analysis further shows the effectiveness of the major components in our model. The DASC-Net enriches the theory of domain adaptation and self-correction learning in medical imaging and can be generalized to multi-site COVID-19 infection segmentation on CT images for clinical deployment.","Jin, Qiangguo; Cui, Hui; Sun, Changming; Meng, Zhaopeng; Wei, Leyi; Su, Ran",Expert Syst Appl,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.09699v1.pdf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33746369/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S095741742100289X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095741742100289X?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2021.114848,192

In this study, we aimed to conduct an auditory-perceptual evaluation of the vocal characteristics of patients with different severities of COVID-19. METHODS: One hundred two patients with mild, moderate, or severe COVID-19 as well as 30 healthy individuals were recruited to compare their respiratory/phonatory parameters. The Persian version of the CAPE-V and GRBAS scales, along with the maximum phonation time and s/z ratio values were used to evaluate the severity of respiratory/phonatory disorders during verbal tasks in the participants. RESULTS: Significant differences were found between the subgroups of patients and their healthy counterparts in all respiratory/phonatory parameters (p ≤ 0.03) except the s/z ratio (p = 0.81). CONCLUSIONS: Based on auditory-perceptual assessments, patients with COVID-19 showed dysphonia. The severity of dysphonia was significantly different among patients with different severities of COVID-19.

It was predictable that countries with weak health systems will be severly wiped out by the pandemic. Countries across Europe faced severe human loses and it was foreseable that Africa will experience an even worse tragedy. Suprisingly, since the evolution of the pandemic, there has been remarkable resistance from African countries, including Cameroon. METHOD: the study was phenomenographic. The data were collected successively from media observations (in particular the WHO site, national TV (CRTV) programs 'Parlons COVID'), social networks - Facebook and Whatsapp) and direct observations of some quarters of Garoua (Roumdé-Adjia, Foulbéré, Kakataré) and Mora for the Far North and the southern zone of Yaoundé (Ngoa-Ekelé, Nkolondom, Mokolo). These observations were associated with individual interview, reviews and note-taking around places of public circulation (places of worship, markets and discussion sites (Faada). The theory of functionalism was mobilized in this study. RESULTS: the results show that Cameroonians perceive the pandemic as an eminently metasocial phenomenon which explains their tendency to use prayers, nature to counter this attack. CONCLUSION: the study suggests that a multidimensional approach is capable of offering avenues of « liberation ». Also, the study once again raises the place of traditional medecine in health systems and shows the close link that exists between traditional medicine and spirituality.","Talikoa, Amada; Ngoumou, Rose-Danielle",Pan Afr Med J,https://doi.org/10.11604/pamj.2021.38.348.27333; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34367427/,192
618190,2021 Annual Meeting: CEO and Medical Director Address,2021,"In response to the impending spread of COVID-19, universities worldwide abruptly stopped face-to-face teaching and switched to technology-mediated teaching. As a result, the use of technology in the learning processes of students of different disciplines became essential and the only way to teach, communicate and collaborate for months. In this crisis context, we conducted a longitudinal study in four German universities, in which we collected a total of 875 responses from students of information systems and music and arts at four points in time during the spring–summer 2020 semester. Our study focused on (1) the students’ acceptance of technology-mediated learning, (2) any change in this acceptance during the semester and (3) the differences in acceptance between the two disciplines. We applied the Technology Acceptance Model and were able to validate it for the extreme situation of the COVID-19 pandemic. We extended the model with three new variables (time flexibility, learning flexibility and social isolation) that influenced the construct of perceived usefulness. Furthermore, we detected differences between the disciplines and over time. In this paper, we present and discuss our study’s results and derive short- and long-term implications for science and practice.","Vladova, Gergana; Ullrich, André; Bender, Benedict; Gronau, Norbert",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33613405/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.636086,192

Here, we generated a replication competent recombinant VSV-{Delta}G-spike vaccine, in which the glycoprotein of VSV was replaced by the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2. In vitro characterization of the recombinant VSV-{Delta}G-spike indicated expression and presentation of the spike protein on the viral membrane with antigenic similarity to SARS-CoV-2. A golden Syrian hamster in vivo model for COVID-19 was implemented. We show that vaccination of hamsters with recombinant VSV-{Delta}G-spike results in rapid and potent induction of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Importantly, single-dose vaccination was able to protect hamsters against SARS-CoV-2 challenge, as demonstrated by the abrogation of body weight loss of the immunized hamsters compared to unvaccinated hamsters. Furthermore, whereas lungs of infected hamsters displayed extensive tissue damage and high viral titers, immunized hamsters lungs showed only minor lung pathology, and no viral load. Taken together, we suggest recombinant VSV-{Delta}G-spike as a safe, efficacious and protective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Yahalom-Ronen, Yfat; Tamir, Hadas; Melamed, Sharon; Politi, Boaz; Shifman, Ohad; Achdout, Hagit; Vitner, Einat B.; Israeli, Ofir; Milrot, Elad; Stein, Dana; Cohen-Gihon, Inbar; Lazar, Shlomi; Gutman, Hila; Glinert, Itai; Cherry, Lilach; Vagima, Yaron; Lazar, Shirley; Weiss, Shay; Ben-Shmuel, Amir; Avraham, Roy; Puni, Reut; Lupu, Edith; David, Elad Bar; Sittner, Assa; Erez, Noam; Zichel, Ran; Mamroud, Emanuelle; Mazor, Ohad; Levy, Haim; Laskar, Orly; Yitzhaki, Shmuel; Shapira, Shmuel C.; Zvi, Anat; Beth-Din, Adi; Paran, Nir; Israely, Tomer",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.18.160655,192
620228,Multifaceted Roles of Adipose Tissue-Derived Exosomes in Physiological and Pathological Conditions,2021-04-20,"Abstract cDNA, synthesized on bovine coronavirus (BCV) genomic RNA templates, could be used to detect very small quantities (i.e. 1 pg) of viral RNA by hybridization with either radioisotopic-labelled or biotinylated recombinant plasmids. Virus was optimally attached to nitrocellulose membranes when spotted in 1 × SSC, whereas 20 × SSC was superior for viral RNA. Denaturation and RNA fixation of both RNA, still encapsidated in virus particles and isolated genomic RNA, was achieved by baking of the blots in vacuum. Virus detection in the supernatant of infected HRT-18 cells was feasible, but improved significantly after proteinase K treatment. No homology was observed between virus cDNA with either plasmid DNA or nucleic acid isolated from non-infected HRT-18 cells. Hybridization with radioisotopic-labelled probes in higher formamide concentrations (up to 60%) increased the detection signals, possibly by reducing reassociation of the probe. Significant detection amplification (30–50 times) was achieved in the case of biotinylated probes by stimulation of hyperpolymer formation on already hybridized target sequences, by additional hybridization with biotinylated pUC-19. A detection amplification was also obtained when hybridization was done with two probes (pBC-52 and pBC-247), containing non-overlapping viral sequences. Although the detectability was surpassed by biotinylated probes, sensitivity was superior in radioisotopic virus detection.","Verbeek, Arnold; Tijssen, Peter",Molecular and Cellular Probes,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3221884/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0890850888900059; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0890850888900059,192
621382,The global challenge of infectious diseases: the evolving role of the National Institutes of Health in basic and clinical research,2005,"Herein, we discuss the potential role of folic acid-based radiopharmaceuticals for macrophage imaging to support clinical decision-making in patients with COVID-19. Activated macrophages play an important role during coronavirus infections. Exuberant host responses, i.e., a cytokine storm with increase of macrophage-related cytokines, such as TNFα, IL-1β, and IL-6 can lead to life-threatening complications, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which develops in approximately 20% of the patients. Diverse immune modulating therapies are currently being tested in clinical trials. In a preclinical proof-of-concept study in experimental interstitial lung disease, we showed the potential of (18)F-AzaFol, an (18)F-labeled folic acid-based radiotracer, as a specific novel imaging tool for the visualization and monitoring of macrophage-driven lung diseases. (18)F-AzaFol binds to the folate receptor-beta (FRβ) that is expressed on activated macrophages involved in inflammatory conditions. In a recent multicenter cancer trial, (18)F-AzaFol was successfully and safely applied (NCT03242993). It is supposed that the visualization of activated macrophage-related disease processes by folate radiotracer-based nuclear imaging can support clinical decision-making by identifying COVID-19 patients at risk of a severe disease progression with a potentially lethal outcome.","Müller, Cristina; Schibli, Roger; Maurer, Britta",Pharmaceuticals (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/ph13090238; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32916949/,192

622681,"Occurrence of microbial indicators, pathogenic bacteria and viruses in tropical surface waters subject to contrasting land use",2019-03-01,"BACKGROUND: Gender imbalances in academia have been evident historically and persist today. For the past 60 years, we have witnessed the increase of participation of women in biomedical disciplines, showing that the gender gap is shrinking. However, preliminary evidence suggests that women, including female researchers, are disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of unequal distribution of childcare, elderly care, and other kinds of domestic and emotional labor. Sudden lockdowns and abrupt shifts in daily routines have had disproportionate consequences on their productivity, which is reflected by a sudden drop in research output in biomedical research, consequently affecting the number of female authors of scientific publications. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that the COVID-19 pandemic has had a disproportionate adverse effect on the productivity of female researchers in the biomedical field in terms of authorship of scientific publications. METHODS: This is a retrospective observational bibliometric study. We investigated the proportion of male and female researchers who published scientific papers during the COVID-19 pandemic, using bibliometric data from biomedical preprint servers and selected Springer-Nature journals. We used the ordinary least squares regression model to estimate the expected proportions over time by correcting for temporal trends. We also used a set of statistical methods, such as the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and regression discontinuity design, to test the validity of the results. RESULTS: A total of 78,950 papers from the bioRxiv and medRxiv repositories and from 62 selected Springer-Nature journals by 346,354 unique authors were analyzed. The acquired data set consisted of papers that were published between January 1, 2019, and August 2, 2020. The proportion of female first authors publishing in the biomedical field during the pandemic dropped by 9.1%, on average, across disciplines (expected arithmetic mean y(est)=0.39; observed arithmetic mean y=0.35; standard error of the estimate, S(est)=0.007; standard error of the observation, σ(x)=0.004). The impact was particularly pronounced for papers related to COVID-19 research, where the proportion of female scientists in the first author position dropped by 28% (y(est)=0.39; y=0.28; S(est)=0.007; σ(x)=0.007). When looking at the last authors, the proportion of women dropped by 7.9%, on average (y(est)=0.25; y=0.23; S(est)=0.005; σ(x)=0.003), while the proportion of women writing about COVID-19 as the last author decreased by 18.8% (y(est)=0.25; y=0.21; S(est)=0.005; σ(x)=0.007). Further, by geocoding authors’ affiliations, we showed that the gender disparities became even more apparent when disaggregated by country, up to 35% in some cases. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings document a decrease in the number of publications by female authors in the biomedical field during the global pandemic. This effect was particularly pronounced for papers related to COVID-19, indicating that women are producing fewer publications related to COVID-19 research. This sudden increase in the gender gap was persistent across the 10 countries with the highest number of researchers.

624909,Human Amnesia,2020-10-05,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic and quarantine had a significant impact on mental health which resulted in an increase of anxiety and depression in adult, child and adolescent clinical populations. Less is known about the potential effect of pandemic on obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) so there is a lack of review work to illustrate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on OCD. Purpose: The main objective is to review all the empirical contributions published after March 2020 that dealt with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on OCD in adults, children and adolescents, investigating the state-of-the-art literature concerning the impact on OCD and detailing limitations. Methods: The literature search was conducted using PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, and Google Scholar. This review analyzed all studies from January 2020 to 8 January 2021, focusing on clinical populations of children, adolescents, and adults with OCD. Results: A total of 102 articles were screened, resulting in the identification of 64 full-text articles to be further scrutinized. Upon closer examination, there was consensus that 39 articles met the study inclusion criteria and 14 of these were selected for study. Analysis of the results revealed that COVID-19 had an impact on OCD in both adults and young people and seems to have caused exacerbation of symptoms, especially of the contamination/washing subtypes. Eight studies in adult samples showed an increase in the severity of obsessive-compulsive symptoms; two studies underlined a minimal impact of COVID-19 on OCD patients and one study showed a slight improvement in symptoms. Two out of three studies on children and adolescents showed an exacerbation of OCD and a worsening even in the presence of an ongoing treatment. Conclusions: The studies reviewed are few. There are more studies on adult OCD than on children and adolescents. The results are controversial: few studies examined OCD subtypes; in most studies the typology of treatment was not clear and the samples covered a wide age range; a large number of studies did not use the same monitoring period or quantitative measures, both of which make it difficult to compare or rely on the results.","Zaccari, Vittoria; D'Arienzo, Maria Chiara; Caiazzo, Tecla; Magno, Antonella; Amico, Graziella; Mancini, Francesco",Front Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34054624/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.673161,192

As explored widely in the literature, one potential instrument to diminish these issues is financial inclusion, including the access and usage of financial services by all people. Specifically, this paper verifies if financial inclusion and technology adoption decrease the poverty headcount ratio and the Gini index (i.e., inequality) of 13 Latin America countries (Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Honduras, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, and Uruguay). To perform such analysis, an unbalanced panel dataset was built, and the Feasible Generalized Least Squares (FGLS) and the Limited Information Maximum Likelihood (LIML) techniques were employed. The results suggest that, in accordance with previous studies, financial inclusion is a powerful tool to tackle poverty and inequality. Additionally, the combined effects of financial inclusions and technology (i.e., mobile use) are also capable of decreasing the poverty and inequality levels. We discuss the policy implications of our findings and suggest a future research agenda.","Polloni-Silva, Eduardo; da Costa, Naijela; Moralles, Herick Fernando; Sacomano Neto, Mario",Soc Indic Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34127874/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11205-021-02730-7,192

Cytokine storm syndrome (CSS) characterized with elevated inflammation and multi-organs failure is closely correlated with the bad outcome of COVID-19. Hence, inhibit the process of CSS by controlling excessive inflammation is considered one of the most promising ways for COVID-19 treatment. RESULTS: Here, we developed a biomimetic nanocarrier based drug delivery system against COVID-19 via anti-inflammation and antiviral treatment simultaneously. Firstly, lopinavir (LPV) as model antiviral drug was loaded in the polymeric nanoparticles (PLGA-LPV NPs). Afterwards, macrophage membranes were coated on the PLGA-LPV NPs to constitute drugs loaded macrophage biomimetic nanocarriers (PLGA-LPV@M). In the study, PLGA-LPV@M could neutralize multiple proinflammatory cytokines and effectively suppress the activation of macrophages and neutrophils. Furthermore, the formation of NETs induced by COVID-19 patients serum could be reduced by PLGA-LPV@M as well. In a mouse model of coronavirus infection, PLGA-LPV@M exhibited significant targeted ability to inflammation sites, and superior therapeutic efficacy in inflammation alleviation and tissues viral loads reduction. CONCLUSION: Collectively, such macrophage biomimetic nanocarriers based drug delivery system showed favorable anti-inflammation and targeted antiviral effects, which may possess a comprehensive therapeutic value in COVID-19 treatment.

625947,Cartas al editor,2020-11-15,"Several factors are linked with a higher risk of mortality from Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), including male gender, increased age, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cancer. Hyperglycemic COVID-19 patients have severe clinical problems, increased ICU admittance, machine-driven ventilation, and a substantial rise in inflammatory markers. Among all patients, those with diabetes or hyperglycemia have a two- to four-fold increase in mortality and severity of COVID-19 than those without diabetes. The primary cause of mortality in COVID-19 patients with diabetes is compromised immune response to viral infections. Increased blood sugar level probably affects intracellular degradation of bacteria, neutrophil chemotaxis, and phagocytosis, thus improving viral binding affinity and entry and decreasing virus clearance. In addition, it has significant effects on the proteins by inducing glycosylation and altering the composition of complements, and glycosylation renders cells susceptible to viral inflammation and damage. The treatment of COVID-19 in patients with diabetes requires an integrated team approach to minimize the risk of medical complications and mortality. Moreover, physicians should adopt proactive strategies to care for persons with comorbidities. This strategy would help reduce the frequency of complications and mortality among patients and load on the healthcare system.","Gazzaz, Zohair Jamil",Open Life Sci,https://doi.org/10.1515/biol-2021-0034; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33817321/,192

The mental health effects of the pandemic and related containment measures are minimally documented in this region. This study examines the association between COVID-19 related stressors and mental health during a strict stay-at-home order in South Africa. A total of 860 self-selected participants residing in the Western Cape province completed an online survey from 20-31 May 2020. This sample consisted mainly of higher socioeconomic and higher educated segments of the population. Structural equation modelling was used to assess how sociodemographic factors, membership of vulnerable groups and COVID-19 related stressors were associated with PHQ-9 (depression) and GAD-7 (anxiety) scores. 46.0% and 47.2% of participants met the diagnostic threshold of anxiety and depressive disorder, respectively. Considerable daily life repercussions were linked to these scores. Among these participants, less than 20% consulted a formal practitioner and this was 12% for participants without a pre-existing mental health condition. Distress related to containment measures and distress about being infected were significantly associated with more anxiety and depressive symptoms. Having a pre-existing mental health condition was associated with poorer mental health, but being an active health worker was not. Younger age, being female, and living in a non-rural area were associated with poorer mental health. Our findings suggest a considerable mental health impact of this pandemic and related containment measures, but low attendance of mental health services. The accessibility to tailored mental health support is essential under these circumstances, especially for vulnerable groups.","De Man, Jeroen; Smith, Mario R; Schneider, Marguerite; Tabana, Hanani",Psychol Health Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34319182/; https://doi.org/10.1080/13548506.2021.1954671,192

To date several measurement methods have been developed to extract the vibration information from the self-mixed (SM) signal; however, the complexity and accuracy of the methods still need improvement. The presented work tries to fulfill the gap by realizing a novel method using maximal overlap discrete wavelet transformation (MODWT) and multi-resolution analysis (MRA). The proposed method can reconstruct the micro-harmonic (< [Formula: see text]) vibration up to 1 kHz even under weak feedback conditions. The mean squared error and the maximum relative error of the proposed method for this range remained below 1.89 [Formula: see text] & 8.79%, respectively. Although, above 1 kHz, the proposed method turns out to be futile to reconstruct the vibration signal but still capable to measure vibration frequency up to 10 kHz with an accuracy of [Formula: see text] 0.0001. The method also found suitable to measure non-sinusoidal vibration frequency with reasonable accuracy even for the moderate feedback conditions. The authors envision that the proposed method will provide a compact, non-contact, and low-cost alternative for the vibration frequency measurement hence useful in early fault detection schemes and lung abnormality diagnosis.","Bhardwaj, Vibhor Kumar; Maini, Surita",Opt Commun,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0030401820307471?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0030401820307471; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32834124/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.optcom.2020.126330,192

The virus grew optimally in the CHSE-214 cell line at 15 °C producing a diffuse cytopathic effect; however, juvenile rainbow trout exposed to cell culture-grown virus showed no mortality or gross pathology. Electron microscopy of preparations from infected cell cultures revealed the presence of typical orthomyxovirus particles. The complete genome of RbtOV is comprised of eight linear segments of single-stranded, negative-sense RNA having highly conserved 5′ and 3′-terminal nucleotide sequences. Another virus isolated in 2014 from steelhead trout (also O. mykiss) in Wisconsin, USA, and designated SttOV was found to have eight genome segments with high amino acid sequence identities (89–99%) to the corresponding genes of RbtOV, suggesting these new viruses are isolates of the same virus species and may be more widespread than currently realized. The new isolates had the same genome segment order and the closest pairwise amino acid sequence identities of 16–42% with Infectious salmon anemia virus (ISAV), the type species and currently only member of the genus Isavirus in the family Orthomyxoviridae. However, pairwise comparisons of the predicted amino acid sequences of the 10 RbtOV and SttOV proteins with orthologs from representatives of the established orthomyxoviral genera and a phylogenetic analysis using the PB1 protein showed that while RbtOV and SttOV clustered most closely with ISAV, they diverged sufficiently to merit consideration as representatives of a novel genus. A set of PCR primers was designed using conserved regions of the PB1 gene to produce amplicons that may be sequenced for identification of similar fish orthomyxoviruses in the future.","Batts, William N.; LaPatra, Scott E.; Katona, Ryan; Leis, Eric; Ng, Terry Fei Fan; Brieuc, Marine S.O.; Breyta, Rachel B.; Purcell, Maureen K.; Conway, Carla M.; Waltzek, Thomas B.; Delwart, Eric; Winton, James R.",Virus Res,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016817021630627X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2017.01.005; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S016817021630627X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28088362/,192
629853,COVID-19: Rescue by transcriptional inhibition,2020-07-01,"To date, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection is increasing worldwide and represents a primary healthcare emergency. Although the infection can be asymptomatic, several cases develop severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) characterized by high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, primarily interleukin (IL)-6. Based on available data, the severity of ARDS and serum levels of IL-6 are key determinants for the prognosis. In this scenario, available in vitro and in vivo data suggested that myo-inositol is able to increase the synthesis and function of the surfactant phosphatidylinositol, acting on the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-regulated signaling, with amelioration of both immune system and oxygenation at the bronchoalveolar level. In addition, myo-inositol has been found able to decrease the levels of IL-6 in several experimental settings, due to an effect on the inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1)-X-box-binding protein 1 (XBP1) and on the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) pathways. In this scenario, treatment with myo-inositol may be able to reduce IL-6 dependent inflammatory response and improve oxygenation in patients with severe ARDS by SARS-CoV-2. In addition, the action of myo-inositol on IRE1 endonuclease activity may also inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV-2, as was reported for the respiratory syncytial virus. Since the available data are extremely limited, if this potential therapeutic approach will be considered valid in the clinical practice, the necessary future investigations should aim to identify the best dose, administration route (oral, intravenous and/or aerosol nebulization), and cluster(s) of patients which may get beneficial effects from this treatment.","Simone Laganà, Antonio; Unfer, Vittorio; Garzon, Simone; Bizzarri, Mariano",Med Hypotheses,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0306987720325238; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987720325238?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33254564/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.110262,192

European healthcare services must address this issue as the number of healthcare users with an MM background increases. Aim: To explore the perspectives of key stakeholders and healthcare users with an MM background on transcultural care in four European countries. Design: Qualitative phenomenological study. Methods: Semi-structured, individual interviews were conducted with stakeholders and MM users. Interviews were translated and transcribed verbatim and were carried out from February to May 2021. Descriptive statistics was used to describe the characteristics of the sample; qualitative data were analyzed thematically following Braun and Clarke’s phases, resulting in 6 themes and 18 subthemes. Results: For stakeholders and MM users with long-established residence in their respective countries, cultural differences involve different family and community norms, religious beliefs, lifestyles, and habits. These components are perceived as in tension with healthcare norms and values, and they mediate in two key and related aspects of the relationship between MM users and healthcare providers: accessibility and communication. Conclusions: Communication and access to healthcare are key to MM health service users, and they are the most frequent sources of misunderstanding and conflict between them and healthcare professionals. Impact: It is important to extend the investigation of cultural issues in healthcare to stakeholders and MM users. There is no doubt that healthcare professionals should be trained in cultural competence; however, cultural competence training is not the only area for improvement. There should be a change in paradigm in healthcare services across Europe: from individual to organizational integration of culture and diversity.","Gaya-Sancho, Benjamin; Vanceulebroeck, Valérie; Kömürcü, Nuran; Kalkan, Indrani; Casa-Nova, Antonio; Tambo-Lizalde, Elena; Coelho, Margarida; Present, Evy; Değirmenci Öz, Seda; Coelho, Teresa; Vermeiren, Sofie; Kavala, Arzu; Jerue, Benjamin Adam; Sáez-Gutiérrez, Berta; Antón-Solanas, Isabel",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34639803/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph181910503,192

We report the case of an 87 year-old woman, with no history of immune deficit, admitted in our Emergency Room for severe respiratory distress. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) diagnosis was confirmed by a SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) on nasal swab.

So far, no proper line of treatment or vaccines has been available against SARS-CoV-2. Since, the infected people rapidly increased, causing the saturation of healthcare systems with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients. As the virus spread to new locations it also acquired various mutations. Here, in this study, we focused on identifying mutations in one of the crucial complex of SARS-CoV-2, the Nsp10-Nsp16 2′-O-methyltransferase complex. This complex plays indispensable role in the post-transcriptional modifications of viral RNA by its capping. We analysed 208 sequences of Nsp10-Nsp16 reported from India and compared with first reported sequence from Wuhan, China. Our analysis revealed a single mutation in Nsp10 and five mutations in Nsp16 protein. We also show that these mutations are leading to alteration in the secondary structure of Nsp10-Nsp16. Further, the protein modelling studies revealed that the mutation of both Nsp10-Nsp16 impacts the protein dynamicity and stability.

At the beginning of 2020, the COVID-19 epidemic evolved into a pandemic, which continues to this day. Within many countries, several control strategies or combinations of them, like restrictions (e.g. lockdown actions), medical care (e.g. development of vaccine or medicaments) and medical prevention (e.g. hygiene concept), were established with the goal to control the pandemic. Depending on the chosen control strategy, the COVID-19 spreading behavior slowed down or approximately stopped for a defined time range. This phenomenon is called saturation effect and can be described by saturation models: E.g. a fundamental approach is Verhulst (1838). The model parameter allows the interpretation of the spreading speed (growth) and the saturation effect in a sound way. This paper shows results of a research study of the COVID-19 spreading behavior and saturation effects depending on different pandemic control strategies in different countries and time phases based on Johns Hopkins University data base (2020).

633127,Assembling evidence for identifying reservoirs of infection,2014-05-31,"By dint of the aging population and further deepened with the Covid-19 pandemic, lung disease has turned out to be a major cause of worldwide morbidity and mortality. The condition is exacerbated when the immune system further attacks the healthy, rather than the diseased, tissue within the lung. Governed by unremittingly proliferating mesenchymal cells and increased collagen deposition, if inflammation persists, as frequently occurs in aging lungs, the tissue develops tumors and/or turns into scars (fibrosis), with limited regenerative capacity and organ failure. Fas ligand (FasL, a ligand of the Fas cell death receptor) is a key factor in the regulation of these processes. FasL is primarily found in two forms: full length (membrane, or mFasL) and cleaved (soluble, or sFasL). We and others found that T-cells expressing the mFasL retain autoimmune surveillance that controls mesenchymal, as well as tumor cell accumulation following an inflammatory response. However, mesenchymal cells from fibrotic lungs, tumor cells, or cells from immune-privileged sites, resist FasL(+) T-cell-induced cell death. The mechanisms involved are a counterattack of immune cells by FasL, by releasing a soluble form of FasL that competes with the membrane version, and inhibits their cell death, promoting cell survival. This review focuses on understanding the previously unrecognized role of FasL, and in particular its soluble form, sFasL, in the serum of aged subjects, and its association with the evolution of lung disease, paving the way to new methods of diagnosis and treatment.","Wallach-Dayan, Shulamit B.; Petukhov, Dmytro; Ahdut-HaCohen, Ronit; Richter-Dayan, Mark; Breuer, Raphael",Int J Mol Sci,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22042177; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33671651/,192

Strategies to create surge ICU capacity requires complex local and national service reconfiguration and reduction or cancellation of elective activity. Theses measures require time to implement and have an inevitable lag before additional capacity comes on-line. An accurate short-range forecast would be helpful in guiding such difficult, costly and ethically challenging decisions. At the time this work began, cases in England were starting to increase. Here we present an attempt at an agile short-range forecast based on published real-time COVID-19 case data from the seven National Health Service commissioning regions in England (East of England, London, Midlands, North East and Yorkshire, North West, South East and South West). We use a Monte Carlo approach to model the likely impact of current diagnoses on regional ICU capacity over a 14 day horizon. Our model is designed to be parsimonious and based on plausible epidemiological data from the literature available. On the basis of the modelling assumptions made, ICU occupancy is likely to increase dramatically in the the days following the time of modelling. If the current exponential growth continues, 5 out of 7 commissioning regions will have more critically ill COVID-19 patients than there are ICU beds within two weeks\todo{last thing to do}. Despite variable growth in absolute patients, all commissioning regions are forecast to be heavily burdened under the assumptions used. Whilst, like any forecast model, there remain uncertainties both in terms of model specification and robust epidemiological data in this early prospective phase, it would seem that surge capacity will be required in the very near future. We hope that our model will help policy decision makers with their preparations. The uncertainties in the data highlight the urgent need for ongoing real-time surveillance to allow forecasts to be constantly updated using high quality local patient-facing data as it emerges.","Deasy, Jacob; Rocheteau, Emma; Kohler, Katharina; Stubbs, Daniel J.; Barbiero, Pietro; Liò, Pietro; Ercole, Ari",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.19.20039057,192
635416,"Contribution to the taxonomy of Mexican Tersilochinae (Hymenoptera, Ichneumonidae), with descriptions of five new species",2020-10-07,"An outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first reported in Wuhan City, China, in December 2019. Since then, the outbreak has grown into a global pandemic, and neither a vaccine nor a treatment for the disease, termed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is currently available. The slow translational progress in the field of research suggests that a large number of studies are urgently required. In this context, this review explores the impact of bacteriophages on SARS-CoV-2, especially concerning phage therapy (PT). Bacteriophages are viruses that infect and kill bacterial cells. Several studies have confirmed that in addition to their antibacterial abilities, bacteriophages also show antiviral and antifungal properties. It has also been shown that PT is effective for building immunity against viral pathogens by reducing the activation of NF kappa B; additionally, phages produce the antiviral protein phagicin. The Ganges river in India, which originates from the Himalayan range, is known to harbor a large number of bacteriophages, which are released into the river gradually by the melting permafrost. Water from this river has traditionally been considered a therapeutic agent for several diseases. In this review, we hypothesize that the Ganges river may play a therapeutic role in the treatment of COVID-19.","Mishra, Vijaya Nath; Kumari, Nidhi; Pathak, Abhishek; Chaturvedi, Rajnish Kumar; Gupta, Arun Kumar; Chaurasia, Rameshwar Nath",Int J Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32963540/; https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/8844963,192

FSWs are important target for oral pre exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). A multi-centric qualitative study was conducted to explore the FSWs’ willingness to use oral PrEP in India. METHODS: Seventy three interviews and 02 focus group discussions were conducted at 3 high HIV prevalent states in India during 2013–14. Study explored issues around willingness to use oral PrEP. The study was approved by the respective institutional ethics committee of the study sites. Thematic analysis using grounded theory approach was used to analyze the data in N-VIVO version 8.0. RESULTS: Thematic analysis showed events of forced condom-less sex. FSWs believed that oral PrEP could provide independence, financial gains, and privacy and therefore hoped to use it as an alternative to male condom. However, any impact on physical/ aesthetic attributes and reproductive system were not acceptable and could become a barrier. Provider initiated oral PrEP was not preferred. Providers voiced safety monitoring concerns. Adherence emerged as a challenge because of: (1) alcohol use; (2) taking PrEP tablet each day being boring; (3) Stigma because Oral PrEP is ARV based. Alcohol use and dread of repetitive dose brings forth the need for long acting oral PrEP. CONCLUSION: Oral PrEP is acceptable among FSWs; it should be rolled out alongside strong messages on STI protection and PrEP as compliment to condoms. PrEP roll out requires educating communities about HIV treatment versus prevention. Long-acting oral PrEP could address both ‘boredom’ and alcoholism and sustain adherence.","Sahay, Seema; Verma, Archana; Shewale, Suhas; Bangar, Sampada; Bijeshkumar, Athokpam; Angolkar, Mubashir; Subramanian, Thilakavathi; Chandhiok, Nomita",BMC Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-021-06612-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34496781/,192

Attempts have been made to produce vaccines against other respiratory viruses using traditional techniques, but have met with little success. Reverse genetics, although still a r-elatively new tool for the manipulation of negative-strand RNA viruses, has great potential for the preparation of vaccines against many of the common respiratory viruses. In the preparation of live vaccines, reverse genetics s-ystems allow the direct modification of the specific regions in the genomes of negative-stranded RNA viruses concerned with attenuation; the ultimate goal is the introduction of site-specific mutations through a cDNA intermediate in order to develop strains with the requisite attenuation, antigenic and growth properties needed in a vaccine. These techniques can also be used to disarm potentially highly pathogenic viruses, such as emerging H5N1 avian influenza viruses, in order to facilitate large-scale preparation of viruses for use in inactivated vaccines under conditions of manufacturing safety. Before these vaccines become available, residual issues concerned with intellectual property rights to the technology and its application will need to be resolved.","Marsh, GA; Tannock, GA",Expert Opin Biol Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15833074/,192
638067,Events postponed or cancelled because of the coronavirus outbreak,2020-03-31,"INTRODUCTION: The pandemic caused by novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 is a highly contagious disease. The World Health Organization has declared the outbreak of coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) as a global public health emergency. Currently, the research on novel coronavirus is still in the primary stage. The aim of this study is to assess the knowledge and awareness on COVID-19 disease and related infection control measures among the dental fraternity in Visakhapatnam – the smart city. METHODS: A total of 808 dentists from the Visakhapatnam region completed a questionnaire-based survey on the knowledge, awareness, and infection control measures related to COVID-19 infection. The questionnaire was tailored from the guidance and information for health-care workers issued by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Suitable sampling method was used for the collection of data and the distribution of responses was presented as percentages. Explanatory statistics were performed for all groups and subgroups based on the percentage of correct responses. Individual pair-wise comparisons were done using the Chi-square test for the percentage of correct responses. RESULTS: A total of 825 participated in the survey, of which 808 dentists completely answered the survey, and the response rate was 98%. Among the respondents, males and females are 46.8% and 53.2%, respectively. There was a statistically significant difference for all the questions solicited, among age groups (P = 0.001, 0.001) and occupation (P = 0.001, 0.001, 0.004). Private practitioners seem to more awareness compared to teaching faculty, undergraduates, and postgraduates, as they have answered correctly (>70%) for almost all the questions. CONCLUSION: The inputs from the survey help us throw some light and fill up lacunae where required. There is a strong need to implement periodic educational interventions and training programs on infection control practices for COVID-19 among dentists in particular. The information from this survey helps us to make necessary changes in implementing periodic educational webinars and stress on areas where necessary, which is important for the dental fraternity for protecting themselves and shielding our society from COVID-19.","Ravi, Ravi Chandra; Ponugubati, Charishma Chowdary; Bonu, Sunil Kumar; Athkuri, Srividya; Uppalapati, Lakshman Varma; Majeti, Chandrakanth",J Educ Health Promot,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33575389/; https://doi.org/10.4103/jehp.jehp_458_20,192

The number of displaced people reached an unprecedented level in 2015, at a total of 60 million worldwide, with more than 1 million crossing into Europe in the past year alone. Migrants and refugees are often perceived to carry a higher load of infectious diseases, despite no systematic association. We propose three important contributions that the global health community can make to help address infectious disease risks and global health inequalities worldwide, with a particular focus on the refugee crisis in Europe. First, policy decisions should be based on a sound evidence base regarding health risks and burdens to health systems, rather than prejudice or unfounded fears. Second, for incoming refugees, we must focus on building inclusive, cost-effective health services to promote collective health security. Finally, alongside protracted conflicts, widening of health and socioeconomic inequalities between high-income and lower-income countries should be acknowledged as major drivers for the global refugee crisis, and fully considered in planning long-term solutions.","Khan, Mishal S; Osei-Kofi, Anna; Omar, Abbas; Kirkbride, Hilary; Kessel, Anthony; Abbara, Aula; Heymann, David; Zumla, Alimuddin; Dar, Osman",Lancet Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27339456/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1473309916301347; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1473309916301347; https://doi.org/10.1016/s1473-3099(16)30134-7,192

The single-hazard approach to disaster response system is not suited for this scenario. As shown from the experiences of the Philippines, India, Japan, and the Republic of Korea, the conventional single-hazard approach needed to integrate new measures, including basic skills training on handling COVID-19 for disaster responders; additional stockpiles of face coverings, disinfectants, tents, and personal protective equipment (PPE); social distancing at evacuation centers; updating of standard operation procedures (SOPs) and guidelines for disaster response to adapt to the concurrent crises situations. Building on the reports presented by the member countries of Asian Disaster Reduction Center (ADRC), this paper highlights three evolving disaster response practices during the COVID-19 pandemic: (i) digitalization of some aspects of disaster response, including early warning, surveillance, and impact assessment; (ii) dispersed evacuation to enforce social distancing, including other measures such as testing, tracing, and isolating infected individuals; (iii) remote psychological first aid to disaster-impacted individuals who are already experiencing anxieties from the pandemic.

642296,Progress in Pharmacotherapy for Obesity,2021,"The SARS-CoV-2-pandemic is associated different challenges, especially for families. The disruption and challenges require parents to develop strategies to cope with the current situation. One factor that may influence how parents deal with pandemic-associated stressors are experiences of parental childhood maltreatment (CM), which represent a high risk of engaging in endangered parenting. A decisive candidate for the connection between parental CM and the transgenerational transmission could be the parental ability to employ coping strategies. Mothers of a well-documented birth cohort for investigating the pathways leading to resilience or vulnerability in the transgenerational transmission of CM were imbedded in an online “SARS-CoV-2 pandemic survey” assessing maternal ability for coping strategies and the dimension of endangered maternal parenting behavior. 91 mothers completed the online survey. To describe the maternal CM, data from a longitudinal survey were used. Our mediation analysis shows a significant positive relationship between the sum of maternal CM experiences, lack of coping strategies and endangered parenting behavior. This suggests a partial mediation of the association between CM and endangered parenting behavior as the direct effect remained significant when the maternal lack of coping strategies was included as the mediator. Parental CM is a risk factor for coping with stressful situation as well as for endangered parenting behavior. The ability to deal with stress seems to have a significant influence on the context of a possible transgenerational transmission of CM. The results underline the need to consider the unique needs of families with children and to support them as to how to overcome the current crisis.","Köhler-Dauner, Franziska; Clemens, Vera; Hildebrand, Katherina; Ziegenhain, Ute; Fegert, Jörg M.",Dev Child Welf,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34435173/; https://doi.org/10.1177/25161032211014899,192

However, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. In this study, we investigate whether miRNAs in serum exosomes can exert antiviral functions and affect the response to COVID-19 in the elderly and people with diabetes. First, we identified four miRNAs (miR-7-5p, miR-24-3p, miR-145-5p and miR-223-3p) through high-throughput sequencing and quantitative real-time PCR analysis, that are remarkably decreased in the elderly and diabetic groups. We further demonstrated that these miRNAs, either in the exosome or in the free form, can directly inhibit S protein expression and SARS-CoV-2 replication. Serum exosomes from young people can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication and S protein expression, while the inhibitory effect is markedly decreased in the elderly and diabetic patients. Moreover, three out of the four circulating miRNAs are significantly increased in the serum of healthy volunteers after 8-weeks’ continuous physical exercise. Serum exosomes isolated from these volunteers also showed stronger inhibitory effects on S protein expression and SARS-CoV-2 replication. Our study demonstrates for the first time that circulating exosomal miRNAs can directly inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication and may provide a possible explanation for the difference in response to COVID-19 between young people and the elderly or people with comorbidities.","Wang, Yanbo; Zhu, Xiaoju; Jiang, Xia-Ming; Guo, Jingwei; Fu, Zheng; Zhou, Zhen; Yang, Ping; Guo, Hongyuan; Guo, Xu; Liang, Gaoli; Zeng, Ping; Xiao, Gengfu; Ma, Jizheng; Yin, Xin; Zhang, Lei-Ke; Yan, Chao; Zhang, Chen-Yu",Signal Transduct Target Ther,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41392-021-00716-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34381015/,192

In addition, we aimed to identify clinical predictors for a positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) swab result. Patients underwent informal triage, standardized history taking, and physician evaluation, only where indicated. Patients were observed for 30 days. Safety was the primary outcome and was defined as a COVID-19-related 30 day re-presentation rate <5% and mortality rate <1% in patients presenting to the TTC. Feasibility was defined as an overruling of informal triage <5%. Among 4815 presentations, 572 (11.9%) were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, and 4774 were discharged. Mortality at 30-days was 0.04% (2 patients, one of which related to COVID-19).

We collected retrospective observational data on thrombosis and bleeding in 303 consecutive adult patients admitted to the hospital for at least 24 hours for COVID-19. Patients presenting with VTE on admission were excluded. Data were collected until 90 days after admission or known death by using medical records and an established national VTE network. Maximal level of care was ward based in 78% of patients, with 22% requiring higher dependency care (12% noninvasive ventilation, 10% invasive ventilation). Almost all patients (97.0%) received standard thromboprophylaxis or were already receiving therapeutic anticoagulation (17.5%). Symptomatic image-confirmed VTE occurred in 5.9% of patients during index hospitalization, and in 7.2% at 90 days after admission (23.9% in patients requiring higher dependency care); half the events were isolated segmental or subsegmental defects on lung imaging.

The main goals of therapy are to restore hydration and electrolyte concentrations, correct strong ion (metabolic) acidemia, and provide nutritional support. Administration of oral electrolyte solutions (OES) has long been the primary method used to treat neonatal diarrhea in humans and calves because OES are capable of addressing each of the primary goals of therapy. In calves with moderate dehydration, we hypothesized that oral electrolytes would be as good as or better than small volumes of intravenous (IV) or subcutaneous (SC) fluids. Therefore, the main goal of this study was to compare the ability of a commercially available oral electrolyte solution (OES) administered alone or in combination with hypertonic saline with small volumes of IV or SC fluid therapy to resuscitate calves with diarrhea. Thirty-three Holstein calves from 5 to 14 d of age were utilized in this clinical trial. Diarrhea and dehydration were induced by adding sucrose to the milk replacer. In addition, hydrochlorothiazide and spironolactone were given orally and furosemide intramuscularly. Depression status, clinical hydration scores, fecal consistency, and body weight were recorded at regular intervals. Treatment began when calves had severe diarrhea and had a decrease in plasma volume of at least 10%. Calves were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups of 8 to 9 calves per group: (1) OES; (2) OES with hypertonic saline (4 mL/kg, IV); (3) IV fluids (lactated Ringer's, 2 L); or (4) SC fluids (lactated Ringer's, 2 L). Treatments were given at 0 and 12 h. Changes in plasma volume, blood pH, electrolyte levels, and physical examination scores were determined before therapy and again at 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 h after each treatment. All 4 treatments were ultimately successful in improving hydration as well as increasing blood pH; however, animals in both groups that received OES had much faster resuscitation than those in either the IV or SC fluid group. In conclusion, oral electrolyte products remain the gold standard for resuscitating diarrheic calves with moderate dehydration and acidemia and will likely perform better than small volumes of IV lactated Ringer's solution. Subcutaneous fluids by themselves are a poor treatment option and should be only be used as supportive therapy following the initial correction of hypovolemia and metabolic acidosis.","Doré, V.; Foster, D.M.; Ru, H.; Smith, G.W.",J Dairy Sci,https://doi.org/10.3168/jds.2019-16970; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022030219308963; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31606222/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022030219308963,192

We used participants from the Chinese Undergraduate Cohort (CUC), a national prospective longitudinal study to examine the changes in anxiety and depression symptoms severity, stress and sleep quality after being under mass quarantine for three months. Wilcoxon matched pair signed-rank test was used to compare the lifestyle indicators. Severity of anxiety, depression symptoms, stress and sleep quality were compared with Wilcoxon signed-rank test. We used generalized estimating equation (GEE) to further quantify the change in mental health indicators and sleep quality after the COVID-19 mass quarantine compared to baseline.

651982,From inequalities involving exponential functions and sums to logarithmically complete monotonicity of ratios of gamma functions,2020-08-10,"Abstract After the Green Building Regulations in the Zhejiang Province was put into effect in May 2016, cities and prefectures in the province were given directives to set their own individual targets for the provision of green buildings. The city of Ningbo decided to use this opportunity to develop a systematic procedure, using Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (FAHP), to identify which allotments within the municipal area have the greatest potential of delivering green buildings, ensuring the set targets are fair and deliverable. This paper explains in detail the use of FAHP in the production of the Specific Plans for Green Buildings for the city of Ningbo in the Zhejiang Province of China. This innovative multi-faceted method incorporates the level of development in each of the 3213 land allotments in the municipal area, assessing each one for critical aspects such as environmental potential, local economic development land-use and land prices in order to determine an individual roadmap for the ratio of green buildings to be built in each region within the city. This method incorporates a scientific process, in which Pairwise Comparison Analysis was conducted for the selected criteria and aspects to determine the weighting factors and scores in each case. This allowed planners to rank all allotments in the municipal area in terms of their potential to provide green buildings, and thus make the setting of targets to provide these accordingly. This approach breaks away from the traditional method which relies on simple estimation, which is often unjustified. Over the two years since this method was introduced, the effects had been positive, within all the allotments abiding to the set targets.

The Specific Plans for Green Buildings in Ningbo also include the adoption rate of prefabricated buildings and the mandatory date for when by which new residential buildings should be fully-furnished before they are sold (this is not currently the case in most residential buildings in China).

652188,SARS-CoV-2 transmission and control in a hospital setting: an individual-based modelling study,2021-03-22,"The substantial increase in the number of daily new cases infected with coronavirus around the world is alarming, and several researchers are currently using various mathematical and machine learning-based prediction models to estimate the future trend of this pandemic. In this work, we employed the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model to forecast the expected daily number of COVID-19 cases in Saudi Arabia in the next four weeks. We first performed four different prediction models; Autoregressive Model, Moving Average, a combination of both (ARMA), and integrated ARMA (ARIMA), to determine the best model fit, and we found out that the ARIMA model outperformed the other models. The forecasting results showed that the trend in Saudi Arabia will continue growing and may reach up to 7668 new cases per day and over 127,129 cumulative daily cases in a matter of four weeks if stringent precautionary and control measures are not implemented to limit the spread of COVID-19. This indicates that the Umrah and Hajj Pilgrimages to the two holy cities of Mecca and Medina in Saudi Arabia that are supposedly scheduled to be performed by nearly 2 million Muslims in mid-July may be suspended. A set of extreme preventive and control measures are proposed in an effort to avoid such a situation.","Alzahrani, Saleh I.; Aljamaan, Ibrahim A.; Al-Fakih, Ebrahim A.",J Infect Public Health,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876034120304937; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiph.2020.06.001; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1876034120304937; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32546438/,192
652430,Sequence comparison via polar coordinates representation and curve tree,2012-01-07,"Introduction: E-selectin is a recognized marker of endothelial activation; however, its place in Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has not been fully explored. Aims of the study are to compare sE-selectin values among the Intensive Care Unit (ICU)-admitted and non-admitted, survived and non-survived patients and those with or without thrombosis. Methods: A single-center study of patients with COVID-19 hospitalized at Policlinico Umberto I (Rome) from March to May 2020 was performed. Simple and multiple logistic regression models were developed. Results: One hundred patients were included, with a median age (IQR) of 65 years (58–78). Twenty-nine (29%) were admitted to ICU, twenty-eight (28%) died and nineteen (19%) had a thrombotic event. The median value (IQR) of sE-selectin was 26.1 ng/mL (18.1–35). sE-selectin values did not differ between deceased and survivors (p = 0.06) and among patients with or without a thrombotic event (p = 0.22). Compared with patients who did not receive ICU treatments, patients requiring ICU care had higher levels of sE-selectin (36.6 vs. 24.1 ng/mL; p < 0.001). In the multiple logistic regression model, sE-selectin levels > 33 ng/mL, PaO(2)/FiO(2) < 200 and PaO(2)/FiO(2) 200–300 were significantly associated with an increased risk of ICU admission. sE-selectin values significantly correlated with a neutrophil count (R = 0.32 (p = 0.001)) and the number of days from the symptoms onset to hospitalization (R = 0.28 (p = 0.004)). Conclusions: sE-selectin levels are predictive of ICU admission in COVID-19 patients. Since data on the relation between sE-selectin and COVID-19 are scarce, this study aims to contribute toward the comprehension of the pathogenic aspects of COVID-19 disease, giving a possible clinical marker able to predict its severity.","Oliva, Alessandra; Rando, Emanuele; Al Ismail, Dania; De Angelis, Massimiliano; Cancelli, Francesca; Miele, Maria Claudia; Aronica, Raissa; Mauro, Vera; Di Timoteo, Federica; Loffredo, Lorenzo; Mastroianni, Claudio M.",J Clin Med,https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10174018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34501466/,192
653418,"Breakthroughs in Medicinal Chemistry: New Targets and Mechanisms, New Drugs, New Hopes–7",2020-06-28,"The purpose of this study was to examine the deltoid skin biopsy in twenty-three COVID-19 patients, most severely ill, for vascular complement deposition and correlate this with SARS CoV-2 viral RNA and protein localization and ACE2 expression. The deltoid skin microvascular complement screen has been applied to patients with various systemic complement-mediated microvascular syndromes best exemplified by atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome. In 21/23 cases, substantial microvascular deposition of complement components was identified. The two patients without significant complement deposition included one patient with moderate disease and a severely ill patient who although on a ventilator for a day was discharged after 3 days. The dominant microvascular complement immunoreactant identified was the terminal membranolytic attack complex C5b-9. Microvascular complement deposition strongly co-localized in situ with the SARS CoV-2 viral proteins including spike glycoproteins in the endothelial cells as well as the viral receptor ACE2 in lesional and non-lesional skin; viral RNA was not evident. Microvascular SARS CoV-2 viral protein, complement and ACE2 expression was most conspicuous in the subcutaneous fat. Although the samples from severely ill patients with COVID-19 were from grossly normal skin, light microscopically focal microvascular abnormalities were evident that included endothelial cell denudement, basement membrane zone reduplication and small thrombi. It is concluded that complement activation is common in grossly normal skin, primarily in the subcutaneous fat which may provide a link between severe disease and obesity, in people with severe COVID-19 and the strong co-localization with the ACE2 receptor and viral capsid proteins without viral RNA suggests that circulating viral proteins (i.e. pseudovirions) may dock onto the endothelial of these microvessels and induce complement activation.","Magro, Cynthia; Mulvey, J.

Passenger ships, with large numbers of people confined in close quarters, can serve as incubators of disease, seeding the pandemic across the globe as infected passengers return home. Short-term steps taken by local authorities can exacerbate this problem, creating humanitarian crises and worsening the scale of the outbreak. In this work, we have undertaken a model-based examination of the USS Theodore Roosevelt outbreak to understand the dynamics of COVID-19 spread aboard the aircraft carrier. We have used a series of counterfactual ""what-if"" analyses to better understand the options available to public health authorities in such situations. The models suggest that rapid mass evacuation and widespread surveillance testing can be effective in these settings. Our results lead to a set of generalizable recommendations for disease control that are broadly applicable to the current COVID-19 crisis as well as to future pandemics.","Stoddard, M.; Johnson, K.; White, D.; Nolan, R.; Hochberg, N.; Chakravarty, A.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.05.20226712; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.11.05.20226712v1?rss=1,192

To test whether the olfactory neuroepithelium may represent a target of the virus, we generated RNA-seq libraries from human olfactory neuroepithelia, in which we found substantial expression of the genes coding for the virus receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), and for the virus internalization enhancer TMPRSS2. We analyzed a human olfactory single-cell RNA-seq dataset and determined that sustentacular cells, which maintain the integrity of olfactory sensory neurons, express ACE2 and TMPRSS2. ACE2 protein was highly expressed in a subset of sustentacular cells in human and mouse olfactory tissues. Finally, we found ACE2 transcripts in specific brain cell types, both in mice and humans. Sustentacular cells thus represent a potential entry door for SARS-CoV-2 in a neuronal sensory system that is in direct connection with the brain.","Fodoulian, Leon; Tuberosa, Joel; Rossier, Daniel; Boillat, Madlaina; Kan, Chenda; Pauli, Véronique; Egervari, Kristof; Lobrinus, Johannes A.; Landis, Basile N.; Carleton, Alan; Rodriguez, Ivan",iScience,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2020.101839; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589004220310361?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33251489/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2589004220310361,192

METHODS: Description of the first consecutive 100 patients with microbiologically-proven COVID-19 in a large hospital in Madrid, Spain including a minimum of two-month follow up. RESULTS: The median age of the patients (52% males) was 61.5 years (IQR=39.5-82.0) and the median BMI was 28.8 kg/m(2) (IQR=24.7-33.7). Overall 72% of the patients had one or more co-morbid conditions with a median age-adjusted Charlson index of 2 (IQR=0-5.7). Five patients (5%) were immunosup-pressed. The most common symptoms at the time of diagnosis were fever (80.0%), cough (53.0%) and dyspnea (23.0%). The median O(2) saturation at the time of first examination was 94% (IQR=90-97). Chest X-ray on admission was compatible with pneumonia in 63% of the cases (bilateral in 42% and unilateral in 21%). Overall, 30% were managed at home and 70% were admitted to the hospital.

We aimed to develop a clinical model to predict the outcome of patients with severe COVID-19 infection early. METHODS: Demographic, clinical and first laboratory findings after admission of 183 patients with severe COVID-19 infection (115 survivors and 68 non-survivors from the Sino-French New City Branch of Tongji Hospital, Wuhan) were used to develop the predictive models. Machine learning approaches were used to select the features and predict the patients’ outcomes. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was applied to compare the models’ performance. A total of 64 with severe COVID-19 infection from the Optical Valley Branch of Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, were used to externally validate the final predictive model. RESULTS: The baseline characteristics and laboratory tests were significantly different between the survivors and non-survivors. Four variables (age, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level, lymphocyte count and d-dimer level) were selected by all five models. Given the similar performance among the models, the logistic regression model was selected as the final predictive model because of its simplicity and interpretability. The AUROCs of the external validation sets were 0.881. The sensitivity and specificity were 0.839 and 0.794 for the validation set, when using a probability of death of 50% as the cutoff. Risk score based on the selected variables can be used to assess the mortality risk. The predictive model is available at [https://phenomics.fudan.edu.cn/risk_scores/].

However, it is not known whether isolation precautions affect certain hospital-related outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of isolation precautions on hospital-related outcomes and cost of care. DESIGN: Retrospective, propensity-score matched cohort study of inpatients admitted to general internal medicine (GIM) services at three academic hospitals in Toronto, Ontario, Canada between January 2010 and December 2012. PARTICIPANTS: Adult (≥18 years of age) patients on isolation precautions for respiratory illnesses and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were matched to controls based on propensity scores derived from nine covariates: age, sex, Resource Intensity Weight, number of hospital readmissions within 90 days, total length of stay for hospital admissions within 90 days, site of admission, month of isolation, year of isolation, and Case Mix Group. MAIN MEASURES: Thirty-day readmission rates and emergency department visits, hospital length of stay, expected length of stay, adverse events, in-hospital mortality, patient complaints, and cost of care in Canadian doll ars (CAD). KEY RESULTS: A total of 17,649 non-isolated patients were admitted to the participating hospitals during the study period. We identified 1506 patients isolated for respiratory illnesses and 745 patients isolated for MRSA. Compared to non-isolated individuals, those on isolation precautions for respiratory illnesses stayed 17 % longer (95 % CI: 9 %, 25 %), stayed 9 % longer than expected (95 % CI: 3 %, 15 %), and had 23 % higher cost of care (95 % CI: 14 %, 32 %). Patients isolated for MRSA had similar outcomes, but they also had a 4.4 % higher (95 % CI: 1.4 %, 7.3 %) rate of readmission to hospital within 30 days. CONCLUSIONS: Isolation precautions are associated with adverse effects which may result in poorer hospital outcomes. Balancing the benefits for the many with the harms to the few will be a future challenge.","Tran, Kim; Bell, Chaim; Stall, Nathan; Tomlinson, George; McGeer, Allison; Morris, Andrew; Gardam, Michael; Abrams, Howard B.",Journal of General Internal Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11606-016-3862-4; https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11606-016-3862-4.pdf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27752880/,192

The epidemiological data indicate that infection and mortality rates are greater in European populations in comparison with eastern Asians. To test if epidemiological patterns may be partly determined by human genetic variation, we investigated, by exomic and databank analyses, the variability found in the TMPRSS2 gene in populations from different continents, since this gene is fundamental to virus access into human cells. The functional variants revealed low diversity. The analyses of the variation in the modifiers of gene expression indicate that the European populations may have much higher levels of pulmonary expression of the TMPRSS2 gene and would be more vulnerable to infection by SARS-CoV-2. By contrast, the pulmonary expression of the TMPRSS2 may be reduced in the populations from East Asia, which implies that they are less susceptible to the virus infection and, these genetic features might also favor their better outcomes. The presented data, if confirmed, indicates a potential genetic contribution of TMPRSS2 to individual susceptibility to viral infection, and might also influence COVID-19 outcome.","Santos, Ney Pereira Carneiro; Khayat, Andre Salim; Rodrigues, Juliana Carla Gomes; Pinto, Pablo Carmo; Araujo, Gilderlanio Santana; Pastana, Lucas Favacho; Medeiros, Jessyca Amanda Gomes; Fernandes, Marianne Rodrigues; Santos, Arthur Ribeiro dos; Khayat, Bruna Claudia Meireles; Moreira, Fabiano Cordeiro; Santos, Andre Mauricio Ribeiro dos; Assumpcao, Paula Barauna; Santos, Andrea Ribeiro dos; Assumpcao, Paulo Pimentel; Santos, Sidney",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.06.09.20126680v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.09.20126680,192

Due to that, the movement restriction has been enforced to contain this pandemic. Recently, there is an increasing pressure to restart and resurrect social and economic sectors, and to allow people to get back to work. This must be well planned before the movement restriction is lifted. Because of that, this paper aims to review and make recommendations on the new normal for our daily activities and works. Firstly, the social and economic sectors must be opening in phases by emphasizing safety and health than an economic recovery. In the meantime, the WHO recommendations on social distancing and personal hygiene must be adapted and become a new normal. Because of that, the government and local authorities should develop a soft landing approach based on the WHO recommendations. Next, the community must be engaged and empowered to do their parts in preventing the spread of COVID-19. From the new normal recommendations, the people can continue their daily routines, and at the same time can reduce COVID-19 transmission.

We performed a quantitative phosphoproteomic survey of induced pluripotent stem cell-derived AT2s (iAT2s) infected with SARS-CoV-2 at air-liquid interface (ALI). Time course analysis revealed rapid remodeling of diverse host systems, including signaling, RNA processing, translation, metabolism, nuclear integrity, protein trafficking, and cytoskeletal-microtubule organization, leading to cell cycle arrest, genotoxic stress, and innate immunity. Comparison to analogous data from transformed cell lines revealed respiratory-specific processes hijacked by SARS-CoV-2, highlighting potential novel therapeutic avenues which were validated by a high hit rate in a targeted small molecule screen in our iAT2 ALI system.","Hekman, Ryan M.; Hume, Adam J.; Goel, Raghuveera K.; Abo, Kristine M.; Huang, Jessie; Blum, Benjamin C.; Werder, Rhiannon B.; Suder, Ellen L.; Paul, Indranil; Phanse, Sadhna; Youssef, Ahmed; Alysandratos, Konstantinos D.; Padhorny, Dzmitry; Ojha, Sandeep; Mora-Martin, Alexandra; Kretov, Dmitry; Ash, Peter; Verma, Mamta; Zhao, Jian; Patten, J.

671523,CHAPTER 13 FERRETS,2009-12-31,"Abstract Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is an emerged disease of swine characterized by negligible response of type I IFNs and viral persistence. We show that the PRRSV non-structural protein 1 (Nsp1) is the viral component responsible for modulation of IFN response. Nsp1 blocked dsRNA-induced IRF3 and IFN promoter activities. Nsp1 did not block phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of IRF3 but inhibited IRF3 association with CREB-binding protein (CBP) in the nucleus. While IRF3 was stable, CBP was degraded, and CBP degradation was proteasome-dependent, suggesting that CBP degradation is not due to the protease activity of Nsp1 but an intermediary is involved. Our data suggest that the Nsp1-mediated CBP degradation inhibits the recruitment of CBP for enhanceosome assembly, leading to the block of IFN response. CBP degradation is a novel strategy for viral evasion from the host response, and Nsp1 may form a new class of viral antagonists for IFN modulation.","Kim, Oekyung; Sun, Yan; Lai, Frances W.; Song, Cheng; Yoo, Dongwan",Virology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2010.03.039; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682210002229; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20416917/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682210002229,192

Accurate estimation of source strength is the basis for source effective identification. This paper proposes an optimization method for the deconvolution process in the source strength inverse calculation. In the scheme, the concept of time resolution was defined, and combined with different filtering positions and filtering algorithms. The measures to reduce effects of measurement noise were quantitatively analyzed. Additionally, the performances of nine deconvolution inverse algorithms under experimental and simulated conditions were evaluated and scored. The hybrid algorithms were proposed and compared with single algorithms including Tikhonov regularization and iterative methods. Results showed that for the filtering position and algorithm, Butterworth filtering performed better, and different filtering positions had little effect on the inverse calculation. For the calculation time step, the optimal Tr (time resolution) was 0.667% and 1.33% in the simulation and experiment, respectively. The hybrid algorithms were found to not perform better than the single algorithms, and the SART (simultaneous algebraic reconstruction technique) algorithm from CAT (computer assisted tomography) yielded better performances in the accuracy and stability of source strength identification. The relative errors of the inverse calculation for source strength were typically below 25% using the optimization scheme.

The symptoms of COVID-19 varied from modest, mild to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and the latter of which is generally associated with deregulated immune cytokine production; however, we currently know little as to the interplay between the extent of clinical symptoms and the compositions of lung immune microenvironment. Here, we comprehensively characterized the lung immune microenvironment with the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from 3 severe and 3 mild COVID-19 patients and 8 previously reported healthy lung controls through single-cell RNA sequence (scRNA-seq) combined with TCR-seq. Our data shows that monocyte-derived FCN1+ macrophages, whereas notFABP4+ alveolar macrophages that represent a predominant macrophage subset in BALF from patients with mild diseases, overwhelm in the severely damaged lungs from patients with ARDS. These cells are highly inflammatory and enormous chemokine producers implicated in cytokine storm. Furthermore, the formation of tissue resident, highly expanded clonal CD8+ T cells in the lung microenvironment of mild symptom patients suggests a robust adaptive immune response connected to a better control of COVID-19.

Caring for relatives with COVID-19 could have a psychiatric disorder for informal caregivers. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the psychiatric disorders of family caregivers of relatives with COVID-19, in Iran. METHODS: This online survey was conducted with 350 family caregivers over 18 years from April to July 2020, which was guided by the STROBE checklist. The study survey consisted of socio-demographic items, 7-items fear of COVID-19 scale, and a 21-item version of the depression, anxiety, and stress scales. RESULTS: The mean (standard deviation) scores for depression, anxiety, and stress were 20 (0.40), 19.52 (0.39), and 19.72 (0.35), respectively, moreover for fear of COVID-19 was 20.33 (0.43). Of all family caregivers, 77.75%, 75%, and 80% had depression, anxiety, and stress, respectively. Sixty-nine percent of caregivers had fear with moderate to high severity. Being younger, married, having a health-related occupation, not exercising, and high monthly salary were significant predictors of the total score of depression, anxiety, and stress scale (P < 0.05). Further, being married, having a health-related occupation, and not exercising, having comorbidity, high income, and being younger were independent predictors of fear of COVID-19 (P < 0.05). Only 32% and 33% of the variance of total depression, anxiety, and stress, and fear of COVID-19 scores were predicted by the studied variables (p < 0.001).

A total of 801 middle age and older adults with ≥1 chronic condition in Chicago and New York City completed the telephone interview. Adequacy of tangible social support was measured using a brief, validated scale that determined whether an individual needed assistance managing his or her health, and if yes, whether this need was met. Participants reported their level of difficulty engaging in self-management behaviors using 2 discrete items; they also self-reported medication adherence using the ASK-12 medication adherence scale. Mental health status was measured using the depression and anxiety PROMIS short-form instruments. RESULTS: Participants’ mean age was 63 years; 30% identified as Black, 26% identified as Latino, and 12% identified unmet support needs. Inadequacy of tangible support was associated with greater difficulty managing one’s health and accessing medications due to COVID-19, as well as poorer medication adherence, increased anxiety and depressive symptoms, and poorer overall well-being (P’s < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Perceived unmet support needs during stay-at-home orders were associated with greater difficulty engaging in self-management behaviors and poorer overall well-being. Two brief items quickly identified individuals with unmet support needs.","O’Conor, Rachel; Opsasnick, Lauren; Pack, Allison; Yoshino Benavente, Julia; Curtis, Laura M.; Lovett, Rebecca M.; Luu, Han; Wismer, Guisselle; Kwasny, Mary J.; Federman, Alex D.; Bailey, Stacy C.; Wolf, Michael S.",J Prim Care Community Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34109874/; https://doi.org/10.1177/21501327211024411,192

Routinely collected NHS England Cancer Waiting Time data were analysed to compare activity for breast cancer in the first 6 months of 2020 compared to the same time period in 2019. The number of referrals for suspected breast cancer was 28% lower (N = 231,765 versus N = 322,994), and the number of patients who received their first treatment for a breast cancer diagnosis was 16% lower (N = 19,965 versus N = 23,881). These data suggest that the number of breast cancers diagnosed during the first half of 2020 is not as low as initially feared, and a substantial proportion of the shortfall can be explained by the suspension of routine screening in March 2020. Further work is needed to examine in detail the impact of measures to manage the COVID-19 pandemic on breast cancer outcomes.","Gathani, Toral; Clayton, Gill; MacInnes, Emma; Horgan, Kieran",Br J Cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33250510/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41416-020-01182-z,192

677258,Spinning Solitude: Coronavirus and the Philosopher,2021-07-28,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is the causative agent of a respiratory disease with a high case fatality rate. During the formation of the coronaviral replication/transcription complex (RTC), essential steps include processing of the conserved polyprotein nsp7-10 region by the main protease Mpro and subsequent complex formation of the released nsp’s. Here, we analyzed processing of the coronavirus nsp7-10 region using native mass spectrometry showing consumption of substrate, rise and fall of intermediate products and complexation. Importantly, there is a clear order of cleavage efficiencies, which is influenced by the polyprotein tertiary structure. Furthermore, the predominant product is an nsp7+8(2:2) hetero-tetramer with nsp8 scaffold. In conclusion, native MS, opposed to other methods, can expose the processing dynamics of viral polyproteins and the landscape of protein interactions in one set of experiments. Thereby, new insights into protein interactions, essential for generation of viral progeny, were provided, with relevance for development of antivirals.","Krichel, Boris; Falke, Sven; Hilgenfeld, Rolf; Redecke, Lars; Uetrecht, Charlotte",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/860049,192

680978,How unequal vaccine distribution promotes the evolution of vaccine escape,2021-03-28,"Community-based health care clinics and hospital outreach services have the potential to expand coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) diagnostics to rural areas. However, reduced specimen stability during extended transport, the absence of a cold chain to centralized laboratories, and biosafety concerns surrounding specimen handling have limited this expansion. In the following study, we evaluated eNAT (Copan Italia, Brescia, Italy) as an alternative transport system to address the biosafety and stability challenges associated with expanding COVID-19 diagnostics to rural and remote regions. In this study, we demonstrated that high-titer severe acute respiratory virus syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) lysate placed into eNAT medium cannot be propagated in cell culture, supporting viral inactivation. To account for off-site testing in these settings, we assessed the stability of contrived nasopharyngeal (NP) specimens stored for up to 14 days in various transport media (eNAT, eSwab, viral transport medium [VTM], saline, and phosphate-buffered saline [PBS]) at 4°C, 22 to 25°C, and 35°C. The molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 was unaffected by sample storage temperature over the 2 weeks when stored in eNAT or PBS (change in cycle threshold, ≤1). In contrast, variable stability was observed across test conditions for other transport media. As eNAT can inactivate SARS-CoV-2, it may support COVID-19 diagnostics at the point of care. Evaluation of compatibility of eNAT with Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay demonstrated diagnostic accuracy and sensitivity equivalent to those of VTM. Taken together, these findings suggest that the implementation of eNAT as a collection device can expand COVID-19 testing to areas with limited health care access.","Richard-Greenblatt, Melissa; Comar, Courtney E.; Flevaud, Laurence; Berti, Marina; Harris, Rebecca M.; Weiss, Susan R.; Glaser, Laurel",J Clin Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33579730/; https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.00110-21,192
681477,Realising the broader value of vaccines in the UK,2021-04-06,"BACKGROUND: Technologies have been extensively implemented in the fight against the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). While several reviews were conducted regarding technologies used during COVID-19, they were limited either by focusing on a certain technology or feature, or by technologies that were proposed rather than implemented. OBJECTIVE: This review aims to provide an overview of technologies implemented during the first wave of COVID-19 as reported in the literature. METHODS: The authors conducted a scoping review following the guidelines of PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR). Studies were retrieved through searching 8 electronic databases and conducting backward and forward reference list checking. The search terms were chosen based on the target intervention (i.e., technologies) and the target disease (i.e., COVID-19). We included English publications that focused on technologies or digital tools implemented during COVID-19 to provide health-related services regardless of target health conditions, users of technologies, and settings. Two reviewers independently assessed the eligibility of studies and extracted data from the included articles. We then used a narrative approach to synthesize the extracted data. RESULTS: Of 7,374 retrieved studies, 126 were deemed eligible. Telemedicine was the most common type of technologies (85%) implemented in the first wave of COVID-19. The most common mode of telemedicine was synchronous (93.5%). The most common purpose of the technologies was providing consultation (59.5%), followed by following up with patients (35.7%) and monitoring their health status (17.4%). Zoom (17.5%) and WhatsApp (9.5%) were the most common social media and video-conferencing platforms. Both healthcare professionals and health consumers were the most common target users (81.7%). The health condition most frequently targeted by the implemented technologies was COVID-19 (30.2%), followed by any physical health conditions (16.7%) and mental health conditions (10.3%). Technologies were web-based in 84.1% of the included studies. Technologies in the included studies could be used through 11 venues. The most common venue of technologies was mobile applications (68.3%), followed by desktop applications (57.9%), telephone calls (38.9%), and websites (35.7%). CONCLUSIONS: Technologies played a crucial role in mitigating the COVID-19 challenges. Our review did not find other technologies that were implemented during the first wave of COVID-19 (e.g., contact-tracing apps, drones, blockchain). Further, technologies in this review were used for other purposes (e.g., drugs and vaccines discovery, social distancing, and immunity passport). Future research on studies about such technologies and purposes is recommended. Further reviews are required to investigate technologies implemented in the following waves of COVID-19.","Abd-Alrazaq, Alaa; Hassan, Asmaa; Abuelezz, Israa; Ahmed, Arfan; Alzubaidi, Mahmood; Shah, Uzair; Alhuwail, Dari; Giannicchi, Anna; Househ, Mowafa",J. med. internet res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34406962/; https://doi.org/10.2196/29136,192

Existing protocols have relied on scientifically questionable evidence and might not lead to the optimal balance between public health safety and airlines' financial viability. OBJECTIVE: To explore the implementation feasibility of Thai Airways International protocol from the perspectives of passengers and aircrews. DESIGN: An online questionnaire survey of passengers and an in-depth interview with aircrews. SETTING: Two randomly selected repatriation flights operated by Thai Airways International using Boeing 777 aircraft (TG476 from Sydney and TG492 from Auckland to Bangkok) PARTICIPANTS: 377 Thai passengers and 35 aircrews. RESULTS: The mean age of passengers was 28.14 (95%CI 26.72 to 29.55) years old; 57.03% were female. TG492 passengers were mostly students and significantly younger than that of TG476 (p<0.0001) with comparable flying experience (p = 0.1192). The average body temperature was 36.52 (95%CI 36.48 to 36.55) degrees Celsius. Passengers estimated average physical distances of 1.59 (95%CI 1.48 to 1.70), 1.41 (95%CI 1.29 to 1.53), and 1.26 (95%CI 1.12 to 1.41) meters at check-in, boarding, and in-flight, respectively. Passengers were checked for body temperature during the flight 1.97 (95%CI 1.77 to 2.18) times on average which is significantly more frequent in longer than shorter flight (p<0.0001). Passengers moved around or went to the toilet during the flight 2.00 (95%CI 1.63 to 2.37) and 2.08 (95%CI 1.73 to 2.43) times which are significantly more frequent in longer than shorter flight (p = 0.0186 and 0.0049, respectively).

It is important to recognize the risk factors, categorize severity and provide early treatment. Use of high flow devices and non-invasive ventilation has been discouraged due to high chances of aerosol generation. Early intubation and mechanical ventilation areessential to prevent complications and worsening, especially in resource-limited settings with very few centers having expertise to manage critical cases. Hydrophobic viral filter in the ventilator circuit minimizes chances of transmission of virus. Strategies to manage ARDS in COVID-19 include low tidal volume ventilation with liberal sedation-analgesia. At the same time, prevention of transmission of the virus to healthcare workers is extremely important in the intensive care setting dealing with severe cases and requiring procedures generating aerosol.

Smartphone‐connected spirometers, like the Air Next spirometer, have been developed to aid in the home monitoring of patients with pulmonary disease. The aim of this study was to investigate the technical validity and usability of the Air Next spirometer in pediatric patients. METHODS: Device variability was tested with a calibrated syringe. About 90 subjects, aged 6 to 16, were included in a prospective cohort study. Fifty‐eight subjects performed conventional spirometry and subsequent Air Next spirometry. The bias and the limits of agreement between the measurements were calculated. Furthermore, subjects used the device for 28 days at home and completed a subject‐satisfaction questionnaire at the end of the study period. RESULTS: Interdevice variability was 2.8% and intradevice variability was 0.9%. The average difference between the Air Next and conventional spirometry was 40 mL for forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and 3 mL for forced vital capacity (FVC). The limits of agreement were −270 mL and +352 mL for FEV1 and −403 mL and +397 mL for FVC. About 45% of FEV1 measurements and 41% of FVC measurements at home were acceptable and reproducible according to American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society criteria. Parents scored difficulty, usefulness, and reliability of the device 1.9, 3.5, and 3.8 out of 5, respectively.
