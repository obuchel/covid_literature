6544,Das akute Leberversagen,2003,"Despite the youth of the chemokine field, many antagonists of chemokine function have already been identified and tested at the preclinical level. These include neutralizing antibodies, peptidyl and non-peptidyl antagonists and non-specific immunosuppressive agents. These early studies suggest that chemokine agonists have the potential to regulate many diseases, ranging from HIV-1 infection and tumor growth to acute and chronic inflammation. Clinical application will depend on pharmaceutical development. Great strides have been made in defining structural domains of the chemokines involved in receptor binding and activation. The identification of receptors is rapidly progressing, but with 50 potential ligands and 15 characterized receptors, it is obvious that additional molecular studies are needed. The intriguing observation that several pathogens either use chemokine receptors as entry portals or produce chemokine decoys to subvert the immune system suggests that there is much to be learned about the immune system from studies of “virokines.” Future studies should lead to the discovery and design of more effective inhibitors and antagonists with therapeutic benefit.","Howard, O.

Majority of pediatric acute liver failures have unknown etiology. This review intends to discuss the current literature on the challenging aspects of management of acute liver failure. RECENT FINDINGS: Collaborative multidisciplinary approach for management of patients with pediatric acute liver failure with upfront involvement of transplant hepatologist and critical care specialists can improve outcomes of this fatal disease. Extensive but systematic diagnostic evaluation can help to identify etiology and guide management. Early referral to a transplant center with prompt liver transplant, if indicated, can lead to improved survival in these patients. SUMMARY: Prompt identification and aggressive management of pediatric acute liver failure and related comorbidities can lead to increased transplant-free survival and improved post-transplant outcomes, thus decreasing mortality and morbidity associated with this potential fatal condition.","Bhatt, Heli; Rao, Girish S.",Curr Pediatr Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102106/,475
7565,The impact of awareness on epidemic spreading in networks,2012-01-03,"The spreading of an infectious disease can trigger human behavior responses to the disease, which in turn plays a crucial role on the spreading of epidemic. In this study, to illustrate the impacts of the human behavioral responses, a new class of individuals, S(F), is introduced to the classical susceptible-infected-recovered model. In the model, S(F) state represents that susceptible individuals who take self-initiate protective measures to lower the probability of being infected, and a susceptible individual may go to S(F) state with a response rate when contacting an infectious neighbor. Via the percolation method, the theoretical formulas for the epidemic threshold as well as the prevalence of epidemic are derived. Our finding indicates that, with the increasing of the response rate, the epidemic threshold is enhanced and the prevalence of epidemic is reduced. The analytical results are also verified by the numerical simulations. In addition, we demonstrate that, because the mean field method neglects the dynamic correlations, a wrong result based on the mean field method is obtained—the epidemic threshold is not related to the response rate, i.e., the additional S(F) state has no impact on the epidemic threshold.","Liu, Can; Xie, Jia-Rong; Chen, Han-Shuang; Zhang, Hai-Feng; Tang, Ming",Chaos,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7112456/,475

The data of 259 sHLH patients were retrospectively analyzed. The clinical manifestations, laboratory findings, treatment, and prognosis of the CLS-sHLH group and non-CLS-sHLH group were compared. The levels of fibrinogen, albumin, and serum calcium in the CLS-sHLH group were lower than in the non-CLS-sHLH group, and serum triglycerides in the CLS-sHLH group were higher than in the non-CLS-sHLH group (P < 0.05). Univariate analysis showed that fibrinogen level was an independent prognostic factor in sHLH patients complicated with CLS. The median survival time was significantly shorter in patients with fibrinogen ≤ 1.3 g/L than in patients with fibrinogen > 1.3 g/L (P < 0.05). Patients with improved CLS conditions in the CLS-sHLH group had significantly increased albumin and serum calcium after treatment (P < 0.05); patients without improved conditions in the CLS-sHLH group also had significantly increased albumin after treatment (P < 0.05), but the serum calcium did not change significantly (P > 0.05). sHLH patients complicated with CLS had significantly worse prognosis than without CLS.

The Korean National Health Insurance Service—Health Screening Cohort data from 2002 to 2015 were collected. Participants with Bell’s palsy (n = 3203) were matched with participants without Bell’s palsy (n = 12,812). The number of days of previous statin use for 2 years before the onset of Bell’s palsy was analyzed using conditional logistic regression. Subgroups of age, sex, obesity, smoking, alcohol consumption, total cholesterol, and blood pressure were analyzed for any association between Bell’s palsy and prior statin use. The Bell’s palsy group reported greater statin use than the non-Bell’s palsy group (84.6 (standard deviation, SD = 201.7) vs. 74.4(SD = 189.4), p = 0.009). Previous statin use was associated with Bell’s palsy in the crude model (95% confidence intervals = 1.03–1.19, p = 0.006). However, this relationship disappeared when the possible covariates were adjusted for in model 2. All subgroups showed no increased odds for Bell’s palsy in previous statin users. We did not find an association between Bell’s palsy and previous statin use in this Korean population aged ≥40 years.","Kim, So Young; Wee, Jee Hye; Min, Chanyang; Yoo, Dae-Myoung; Choi, Hyo Geun",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7696239/,475
14244,Turning Image Sensors into Position and Time Sensitive Quantitative Colorimetric Data Sources with the Aid of Novel Image Processing/Analysis Software,2020-11-10,"Background: Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease affecting areas with a high density of apocrine glands and characterized by subcutaneous nodules that may evolve into fistulas with pus secretion. Methods: The aim of this review is to investigate all current knowledge on cytokine regulation in the pathogenesis of HS. A systematic literature research using the words “cytokine”, “interleukin”, “pathway”, and “hidradenitis suppurativa” was performed in PubMed/Medline and Scopus/Embase databases. A search of the clinicaltrials.gov website for interventional recruiting and completed trials including the term “hidradenitis suppurativa” was also performed up to August 2020. We will discuss the pathogenetic role of various cytokines in HS and potential therapeutic targets for this debilitating disease. Results: The pathophysiology underlying this complex condition has not been clearly defined. An upregulation of various cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-1, IL-17, IL-23, and other molecules seems to be related to this inflammatory condition. Various cells, such as lymphocytes T Helper 1 and 17 and keratinocytes seem to be involved in the genesis of this condition. Conclusions: Several future studies and clinical trials are necessary in order to have new knowledge about HS and to properly treat this complex condition.","Del Duca, Ester; Morelli, Paola; Bennardo, Luigi; Di Raimondo, Cosimo; Nisticò, Steven Paul",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7696820/,475
15806,The Use of Pulse Oximetry in the Assessment of Acclimatization to High Altitude,2021-02-10,"Zika virus (ZIKV) infections have been associated with an increased incidence of severe microcephaly and other neurodevelopmental disorders in newborn babies. Passive immunization with anti-ZIKV neutralizing antibodies has the potential to become a feasible treatment or prophylaxis option during pregnancy. Prior to clinical use, such antibodies should be assessed for their ability to block ZIKV passage to the fetus. We used human placental and mammalian cell monolayers that express FcRn and laboratory preparations of anti-ZIKV antibodies as a model system to investigate the disposition of ZIKV/antibody immune complexes (ICs) at the maternal-fetal interface. We further characterized solution properties of the ICs to evaluate whether these are related to in vitro effects. We found that both ZIKV and ZIKV envelope glycoprotein can enter and passage through epithelial cells, especially those that overexpress FcRn. In the presence of ZIKV antibodies, Zika virus entry was bimodal, with reduced entry at the lowest (0.3–3 ng/mL) and highest (µg/mL) antibody concentrations. Intermediate concentrations attenuated inhibition or enhanced viral entry. With respect to anti-ZIKV antibodies, we found that their degradation was accelerated when presented as ICs containing increased amounts of ZIKV immunogen. Of the two monoclonal antibodies tested, the preparation with higher aggregation also exhibited higher degradation. Our studies confirm that intact Zika virus and its envelope immunogen have the potential to enter and be transferred across placental and other epithelial cells that express FcRn. Presence of anti-ZIKV IgG antibodies can either block or enhance cellular entry, with the antibody concentration playing a complex role in this process. Physicochemical properties of IgG antibodies can influence their degradation in vitro.","Xu, Yanqun; He, Yong; Momben-Abolfath, Sanaz; Eller, Nancy; Norton, Malgorzata; Zhang, Pei; Scott, Dorothy; Struble, Evi Budo",Vaccines (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7916977/,475

This longitudinal study investigated the relationships between Positive Youth Development (PYD) attributes and IA problems and the mediating role of life satisfaction using a large sample of Chinese high school students (N = 2648). Separated by one academic year, students completed a questionnaire evaluating their adolescent psychosocial adjustment, including validated PYD and IA measures. Multiple regression and structural equation modeling analyses were used. Consistent with the theoretical predictions of PYD models, results revealed a significant negative influence of PYD attributes on IA symptoms concurrently and longitudinally. In particular, general PYD attributes, such as emotional competence, spirituality, and resilience, showed strong and stable protective effects against IA. Life satisfaction also served as a mediator of the influence of all measures of PYD attributes on IA symptoms. The study underlines the importance of PYD attributes in promoting adolescents’ life satisfaction and preventing IA, and thus contributes to the design and implementation of evidence-based intervention and prevention programs.","Dou, Diya; Shek, Daniel T.

16383,The Evolution of the My Way Section: From the 1990s to 2020 and Beyond,2020-06-16,"The lipid-enveloped influenza C virus contains a single surface glycoprotein, the haemagglutinin-esterase-fusion (HEF) protein, that mediates receptor binding, receptor destruction, and membrane fusion at the low pH of the endosome. Here we apply electron cryotomography and subtomogram averaging to describe the structural basis for hexagonal lattice formation by HEF on the viral surface. The conformation of the glycoprotein in situ is distinct from the structure of the isolated trimeric ectodomain, showing that a splaying of the membrane distal domains is required to mediate contacts that form the lattice. The splaying of these domains is also coupled to changes in the structure of the stem region which is involved in membrane fusion, thereby linking HEF’s membrane fusion conformation with its assembly on the virus surface. The glycoprotein lattice can form independent of other virion components but we show a major role for the matrix layer in particle formation.","Halldorsson, Steinar; Sader, Kasim; Turner, Jack; Calder, Lesley J.; Rosenthal, Peter B.",Nat Commun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7966785/,475

17099,Broussochalcone A Is a Novel Inhibitor of the Orphan Nuclear Receptor NR4A1 and Induces Apoptosis in Pancreatic Cancer Cells,2021-04-16,"BACKGROUND: The Type I interferon response is an important first-line defense against viruses. In turn, viruses antagonize (i.e., degrade, mis-localize, etc.) many proteins in interferon pathways. Thus, hosts and viruses are locked in an evolutionary arms race for dominance of the Type I interferon pathway. As a result, many genes in interferon pathways have experienced positive natural selection in favor of new allelic forms that can better recognize viruses or escape viral antagonists. Here, we performed a holistic analysis of selective pressures acting on genes in the Type I interferon family. We initially hypothesized that the genes responsible for inducing the production of interferon would be antagonized more heavily by viruses than genes that are turned on as a result of interferon. Our logic was that viruses would have greater effect if they worked upstream of the production of interferon molecules because, once interferon is produced, hundreds of interferon-stimulated proteins would activate and the virus would need to counteract them one-by-one. RESULTS: We curated multiple sequence alignments of primate orthologs for 131 genes active in interferon production and signaling (herein, “induction” genes), 100 interferon-stimulated genes, and 100 randomly chosen genes. We analyzed each multiple sequence alignment for the signatures of recurrent positive selection. Counter to our hypothesis, we found the interferon-stimulated genes, and not interferon induction genes, are evolving significantly more rapidly than a random set of genes. Interferon induction genes evolve in a way that is indistinguishable from a matched set of random genes (22% and 18% of genes bear signatures of positive selection, respectively). In contrast, interferon-stimulated genes evolve differently, with 33% of genes evolving under positive selection and containing a significantly higher fraction of codons that have experienced selection for recurrent replacement of the encoded amino acid. CONCLUSION: Viruses may antagonize individual products of the interferon response more often than trying to neutralize the system altogether.

17170,Experimental parameters defining ultra-low biomass bioaerosol analysis,2021-04-16,"BACKGROUND: Even though conceptually, Tuberculosis (TB) is almost always curable, it is currently the world’s leading infectious killer. Patients with pulmonary TB are the source of transmission. Approximately 23% of the world’s population is believed to be latently infected with TB bacteria, and 5–15% of them will progress at any point in time to develop the disease. There was a global diagnostic gap of 2.9 million between notifications of new cases and the estimated number of incident cases, and Indonesia carries the third-highest of this gap. Therefore, screening TB among the community is of great importance to prevent further transmission and infection. The electronic nose for screening TB (eNose-TB) project is initiated in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, to screen TB by breath test with an electronic-nose that is easy-to-use, point-of-care, does not expose patients to radiation, and can be produced at low cost. METHODS/DESIGN: The objectives of the two-phase planned project are to: 1) investigate the potential of an eNose-TB as a screening tool in Indonesia, in comparison with screening with clinical symptoms and chest radiology, which are currently used as a standard, and 2) analyze the time and cost of a screening algorithm with eNose-TB to obtain additional case detection. A cross-sectional study will be conducted in the first phase to validate the eNose-TB. The validation phase will involve 395 presumptive TB patients in the Surakarta General Hospital, Central Java. In the second phase, a cross-sectional research will be conducted, involving 1,383 adults and children in the municipality of Yogyakarta and Kulon Progo district of Yogyakarta Province. DISCUSSION: The findings will provide data concerning the sensitivity and specificity of the eNose-TB as a screening tool for tuberculosis, and the time and cost analysis of a screening algorithm with the eNose.

17422,Searching for pneumothorax in x-ray images using autoencoded deep features,2021-05-10,"Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a common hereditary kidney disease, which is featured by progressively enlarged bilateral fluid-filled cysts. Enlarging cysts destroy the structure of nephrons, ultimately resulting in the loss of renal function. Eventually, ADPKD develops into end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Currently, there is no effective drug therapy that can be safely used clinically. Patients progressed into ESRD usually require hemodialysis and kidney transplant, which is a heavy burden on both patients and society. Therefore, looking for effective therapeutic drugs is important for treating ADPKD. In previous studies, herbal medicines showed their great effects in multiple diseases, such as cancer, diabetes and mental disorders, which also might play a role in ADPKD treatment. Currently, several studies have reported that the compounds from herbal medicines, such as triptolide, curcumin, ginkolide B, steviol, G. lucidum triterpenoids, Celastrol, saikosaponin-d, Sparganum stoloniferum Buch.-Ham and Cordyceps sinensis, contribute to the inhibition of the development of renal cysts and the progression of ADPKD, which function by similar or different mechanisms. These studies suggest that herbal medicines could be a promising type of drugs and can provide new inspiration for clinical therapeutic strategy for ADPKD. This review summarizes the pharmacological effects of the herbal medicines on ADPKD progression and their underlying mechanisms in both in vivo and in vitro ADPKD models.","Shao, Guangying; Zhu, Shuai; Yang, Baoxue",Front Pharmacol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8111540/,475
17602,Proceedings from the 13th Annual Conference on the Science of Dissemination and Implementation: Virtual. 15-17 December 2020,2021-05-20,"Influenza A viruses (IAVs) continue to pose an imminent threat to humans due to annual influenza epidemic outbreaks and episodic pandemics with high mortality rates. In this context, the suboptimal vaccine coverage and efficacy, coupled with recurrent events of viral resistance against a very limited antiviral portfolio, emphasize an urgent need for new additional prophylactic and therapeutic options, including new antiviral targets and drugs with new mechanisms of action to prevent and treat influenza virus infection. Here, we characterized a novel influenza A virus nucleoprotein (NP) inhibitor, FA-6005, that inhibited a broad spectrum of human pandemic and seasonal influenza A and B viruses in vitro and protects mice against lethal influenza A virus challenge. The small molecule FA-6005 targeted a conserved NP I41 domain and acted as a potentially broad, multimechanistic anti-influenza virus therapeutic since FA-6005 suppressed influenza virus replication and perturbed intracellular trafficking of viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs) from early to late stages. Cocrystal structures of the NP/FA-6005 complex reconciled well with concurrent mutational studies. This study provides the first line of direct evidence suggesting that the newly identified NP I41 pocket is an attractive target for drug development that inhibits multiple functions of NP. Our results also highlight FA-6005 as a promising candidate for further development as an antiviral drug for the treatment of IAV infection and provide chemical-level details for inhibitor optimization. IMPORTANCE Current influenza antivirals have limitations with regard to their effectiveness and the potential emergence of resistance. Therefore, there is an urgent need for broad-spectrum inhibitors to address the considerable challenges posed by the rapid evolution of influenza viruses that limit the effectiveness of vaccines and lead to the emergence of antiviral drug resistance. Here, we identified a novel influenza A virus NP antagonist, FA-6005, with broad-spectrum efficacy against influenza viruses, and our study presents a comprehensive study of the mode of action of FA-6005 with the crystal structure of the compound in complex with NP. The influenza virus inhibitor holds promise as an urgently sought-after therapeutic option offering a mechanism of action complementary to existing antiviral drugs for the treatment of influenza virus infection and should further aid in the development of universal therapeutics.","Yang, Fang; Pang, Bo; Lai, Kin Kui; Cheung, Nam Nam; Dai, Jun; Zhang, Weizhe; Zhang, Jinxia; Chan, Kwok-Hung; Chen, Honglin; Sze, Kong-Hung; Zhang, Hongmin; Hao, Quan; Yang, Dan; Yuen, Kwok-Yung; Kao, Richard Y.",J Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8104107/,475
17823,Brain tumor segmentation based on deep learning and an attention mechanism using MRI multi-modalities brain images,2021-05-25,"BACKGROUND: Clinically effective and safe genotyping relies on correct reference sequences, often represented by haplotypes. The 1000 Genomes Project recorded individual genotypes across 26 different populations and, using computerized genotype phasing, reported haplotype data. In contrast, we identified long reference sequences by analyzing the homozygous genomic regions in this online database, a concept that has rarely been reported since next generation sequencing data became available. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Phased genotype data for a 80.6 kb region of chromosome 1 was downloaded for all 2,504 unrelated individuals of the 1000 Genome Project Phase 3 cohort. The data was centered on the ACKR1 gene and bordered by the CADM3 and FCER1A genes. Individuals with heterozygosity at a single site or with complete homozygosity allowed unambiguous assignment of an ACKR1 haplotype. A computer algorithm was developed for extracting these haplotypes from the 1000 Genome Project in an automated fashion. A manual analysis validated the data extracted by the algorithm. RESULTS: We confirmed 902 ACKR1 haplotypes of varying lengths, the longest at 80,584 nucleotides and shortest at 1,901 nucleotides. The combined length of haplotype sequences comprised 19,895,388 nucleotides with a median of 16,014 nucleotides. Based on our approach, all haplotypes can be considered experimentally confirmed and not affected by the known errors of computerized genotype phasing. CONCLUSIONS: Tracts of homozygosity can provide definitive reference sequences for any gene. They are particularly useful when observed in unrelated individuals of large scale sequence databases. As a proof of principle, we explored the 1000 Genomes Project database for ACKR1 gene data and mined long haplotypes. These haplotypes are useful for high throughput analysis with next generation sequencing. Our approach is scalable, using automated bioinformatics tools, and can be applied to any gene.

18064,Digital electronics in fibres enable fabric-based machine-learning inference,2021-06-03,"The intense mass media coverage of the Paris terrorist attacks on November 13, 2015 exposed a majority of the French population to the attacks. Prior research has documented the association between media exposure to terrorism and post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). The present study replicated and extended these findings in a French sample. A population-based sample (N = 1,760) was drawn from a national web-enabled panel in June 2016. Hours of attack-related media exposure (i.e., TV-watching, viewing internet images, engaging in social media exchanges) in the 3 days following the attacks were assessed. Multivariate regression models, adjusting for gender, age, direct exposure (i.e., witnessing in person or knowing someone injured or killed), residential area, social support, pre-attack mental health service utilization, and other adverse life events, examined the association between media exposure and PTSS (assessed using the self-report PCL-5). Compared to those reporting less than 2 hours of daily attack-related television exposure, those reporting 2–4 hours (β = 3.1, 95% CI = 0.8–5.3) or >4 hours (β = 4.7, 95% CI = 2.0–7.4) of media exposure reported higher attack-related PTSS. This finding was replicated with social media use: those with moderate (β = 3.2, 95% CI = 0.9–5.5) or high (β = 6.8, 95% CI = 1.9–11.7) use reported higher PTSS than those reporting no use. Subanalyses demonstrated that media exposure and PTSS were not associated in those directly exposed to the attacks. Results highlight the potential public health risk of extensive mass media exposure to traumatic events.","Robert, Maëlle; Stene, Lise Eilin; Garfin, Dana Rose; Vandentorren, Stéphanie; Motreff, Yvon; du Roscoat, Enguerrand; Pirard, Philippe",Front Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8175798/,475

In men, the CB and OSBB odds ratios (ORs) were, respectively, 1.023 (95% CI: 1.004–1.042), 1.019 (95% CI: 1.001–1.038); and in women, the CB, OSBB, and sugar/chocolate ORs were, respectively, 1.026 (95% CI: 1.013–1.039), 1.020 (95% CI: 1.007–1.033), and 1.019 (95% CI: 1.006–1.032). Age, NLAQ, total expenditure, food expenditure, and total physical activity also were related to SSF intake. Age and the application capacity of the NLAQ were negatively associated with SSF intake, whereas comprehension capacity of the NLAQ, total and food expenditure, and total physical activity were positively associated with SSF intake. This study confirmed that SSF intake is widespread among medical college students from Shanghai, China, even if they have relatively high nutrition health literacy. From a public health perspective, it is necessary to reduce SSF intake in medical college students by decreasing the MPAI, controlling the total and food expenditure per month in high-consumption areas, and improving the application ability of the NLAQ. Further studies are needed to explore the MPAI and other potential factors that may influence SSF intake of college students by expanding the sample size of college students throughout China, and the causal association between them.","Liu, Shaojie; Zhou, Weiqiang; Wang, Jiangqi; Chen, Bo; He, Gengsheng; Jia, Yingnan",Nutrients,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8308374/,475

The fundaments of the transition framework and the main characteristics of the circularity indicators are presented. A critical review was performed in order to fulfill the objective of analyzing the current indicators. It is concluded that the indicators in the current framework are (as a selection from a very broad range of indicators theoretically proposed and with estimated practical applicability) limited from the perspective of circularity only to waste generation and recycling processes containing recyclable materials, without including important circularity indicators related to the prolonging and extending the life cycle of products and materials. This paper proposes and defines such an indicator, based on the consideration of the fundamental scalars describing economy, mass, energy, time, and value, respectively.

Several studies had documented that ginseng leaves have anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer properties similar to those of ginseng root. The aim of this research was to forecast of the molecular mechanism of ginseng leaves on lung cancer by molecular docking and network pharmacology so as to decipher ginseng leaves' entire mechanism. The compounds associated with ginseng leaves were searched by TCMSP. TCMSP and Swiss Target Prediction databases were used to sort out the potential targets of the main chemical components. Targets were collected from OMIM, PharmGKB, TTD, DrugBank and GeneCards which related to immunity and lung cancer. Ginseng leaves exert its lung cancer suppressive function by regulating the several signaling proteins, such as JUN, STAT3, AKT1, TNF, MAPK1, TP53. GO and KEGG analyses indicated that the immunoreaction against lung cancer by ginseng leaves might be related to response to lipopolysaccharide, response to oxidative stress, PI3K-Akt, MAPK and TNF pathway. Molecular docking analysis demonstrated that hydrogen bonding was interaction's core forms. The results of CCK8 test and qRT-PCR showed that ginseng leaves inhibit cell proliferation and regulates AKT1 and P53 expression in A549. The present study clarifies the mechanism of Ginseng leaves against lung cancer and provides evidence to support its clinical use.","Li, Zao-Hui; Yu, Dan; Huang, Nan-Nan; Wu, Jun-Kai; Du, Xiao-Wei; Wang, Xi-Jun",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8440634/,475

We evaluated the etiology of pneumonia amongst HIV-uninfected South African children enrolled into the Pneumonia Etiology Research for Child Health case-control study. METHODS: Cases, 1–59 months of age hospitalized with World Health Organization clinically defined severe/very severe pneumonia, were frequency-matched by age and season to community controls. Nasopharyngeal-oropharyngeal swabs were analyzed using polymerase chain reaction for 33 respiratory pathogens, and whole blood was tested for pneumococcal autolysin. Cases were also tested for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Population etiologic fractions (EF) of pneumonia with radiologic evidence of consolidation/infiltrate were derived for each pathogen through Bayesian analysis. RESULTS: Of the 805 HIV-uninfected cases enrolled based on clinical criteria, radiologically confirmed pneumonia was evident in 165 HIV-exposed, -uninfected, and 246 HIV-unexposed children. In HIV-exposed and HIV-unexposed children, respiratory syncytial virus was the most important pathogen with EFs of 31.6% [95% credible interval (CrI), 24.8%–38.8%] and 36.4% (95% CrI, 30.5%–43.1%), respectively. M. tuberculosis contributed EFs of 11.6% (95% CrI, 6.1%–18.8%) in HIV-exposed and 8.3% (95% CrI, 4.5%–13.8%) in HIV-unexposed children, including an EF of 16.3% (95% CrI, 6.1%–33.3%) in HIV-exposed children ≥12 months of age. Bacteremia (3.0% vs. 1.6%) and case fatality risk (3.6% vs. 3.7%) were similar in HIV-exposed and HIV-unexposed children. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccination strategies targeting respiratory syncytial virus should be prioritized for prevention of pneumonia in children. Furthermore, interventions are required to address the high burden of tuberculosis in the pathogenesis of acute community-acquired pneumonia in settings such as ours.","Moore, David P.; Baillie, Vicky L.; Mudau, Azwifarwi; Wadula, Jeannette; Adams, Tanja; Mangera, Shafeeka; Verwey, Charl; Prosperi, Christine; Higdon, Melissa M.; Haddix, Meredith; Hammitt, Laura L.; Feikin, Daniel R.; O’Brien, Katherine L.; Deloria Knoll, Maria; Murdoch, David R.; Simões, Eric A.F.; Madhi, Shabir A.",Pediatr Infect Dis J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8448398/,475

Data from a Spanish professional club were registered over the course of a season. First, the descriptive statistics presented more bursts of accelerations and decelerations in WIMU PRO than in MEDIACOACH, whereas the distances covered recorded by both systems were similar. Second, negative relationships were found (i.e., negative bias) comparing WIMU PRO to MEDIACOACH in the number of accelerations and decelerations between 0/1 m/s(2) and ½ m/s(2) (p < 0.05), and in the distances covered in accelerations and decelerations (p < 0.05) between 0/1 m/s(2) and in accelerations and decelerations registered between 2/3 m/s(2) and more than 3 m/s(2). Moreover, the differences in means (i.e., standardized mean bias) across the two devices were trivial (> 0.19) and small (0.2–0.59) for most variables. The standardized typical errors in the estimate (TEE) were moderate (0.3–0.59) and small to moderate (0.1–0.29 to 0.3–0.59), respectively. Also, the Intra class Correlation Coefficients (ICCs) for agreement and consistency between systems showed good and excellent values (> 0.90). The magnitude of change in means (%) between systems, defined as the percentage change between the numbers or values, was below 14% and 7% for number and distances covered, respectively. All scores in the smallest worthwhile change were lower than 9% and in the coefficients of variation were lower than 95% and 15%, respectively. Thus, both systems demonstrated an acceptable degree of agreement and could be useful in analyzing players’ acceleration demands in professional soccer. However, caution is required when interpreting the results and a comparison with a gold standard is required in order to validate both systems.","Pons, Eduard; García-Calvo, Tomás; Cos, Francesc; Resta, Ricardo; Blanco, Hugo; López del Campo, Roberto; Díaz-García, Jesús; Pulido-González, Juan José",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8448836/,475

While orally and parenterally administered vaccines made from inactivated or attenuated TGEV are commercially available, they require individual administration to piglets, which is time and labor intensive, and run the risk of reversion to pathogenicity. Also, parenteral vaccines produce neutralizing serum antibodies which may be less effective against an orally transmitted pathogen, compared to an oral vaccine that would induce the production of mucosal antibodies. There has been an effort to produce subunit vaccines in an edible form in plants for convenient administration through feed. These efforts towards the expression of the S-antigen of TGEV in maize seed, its effectiveness at inducing neutralizing antibody production in the colostrum of gilts, and its efficacy in protecting piglets against challenge by virulent TGEV are summarized here.","Rajan, V.",Commercial Plant-Produced Recombinant Protein Products,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120389/,475

The first eight chapters of this text deal with agent-specific concerns and strategies for dealing with infections due to the intentional release of these agents. A larger problem arises when the identity of an agent is not known. In fact, in some cases, an attack may be threatened or suspected, but it may remain unclear as to whether such an attack has actually occurred. Moreover, it may be unclear whether casualties are due to a biological agent, a chemical agent, or even a naturally occurring infectious disease process or toxic exposure. Recent experience with West Nile Virus (Fine and Layton, 2001), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) (Lampton, 2003), and monkeypox highlight this dilemma. In each of these cases, the possibility of bioterrorism was raised, and rightly so, although each outbreak ultimately proved to have a natural origin.

The inflammatory response controls virus replication but fails to mediate sterile clearance. The persistence of viral RNA and inflammatory cells within the CNS is associated with the development of ongoing demyelination. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of proteases involved in degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM). During inflammatory responses MMPs are thought to play a significant role in breaking down the basement membrane surrounding blood vessels as well as parenchymal ECM thereby facilitating leukocyte infiltration. MMPs have also been associated with activation of chemokines and perhaps more significantly the degradation of myelin proteins and generation of autoantigens. Recent examination of MMP expression during MHV infection suggests that MMP-3, -9 and -12 are involved in the inflammatory response. The proinflammatory effects of these MMPs are likely tempered by induction of tissue inhibiter of metalloproteinase-1 expression.","Marten, Norman W.; Zhou, Jiehao",Experimental Models of Multiple Sclerosis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122609/,475

No one knows exactly where it came from, but it is postulated that a mutation in an animal virus allowed it to jump species and infect humans. In 1976 simultaneous outbreaks of Ebola occurred in what is now South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). For 20 years, only sporadic cases were seen, but in 1995 a new outbreak occurred killing hundreds in the DRC. Since that time the frequency of these outbreaks has been increasing. It is uncertain why this is occurring, but many associate it with increasing human encroachment into forested areas bringing people and animals into more intimate contact and increased mobility of previously remote population. This chapter will navigate Ebola in the context of global health and security. There are multiple objectives of this chapter. First is to provide a basic understanding of Ebola disease processes and outbreak patterns. Second, is to explore the interplay between social determinants of health and Ebola. The role of technology in spreading Ebola outbreaks will be explained as will Ebola’s potential as a bioweapon.

This study explores whether understanding organizational memetic variation is empirically possible and, if so, whether it might, with further development, provide managers with early indications of a misalignment between organizational action (operationalized as memetic variation) and strategic intent—the amount of memetic variation needed to stay aligned with the competitive environment. A method for empirically identifying knowledge-based memes in everyday practice is developed. It stems from modern advances in genetics allowing micro-level changes in genes to be linked to macro-environmental dynamics. Using the concept that memetic variation is caused by everyday, uncontrollable uncertainties of interpretation, memetic variation is reduced to seven categorical types. A highly exploratory quasi-experimental design allows a preliminary comparison of a would-be innovative ‘Portfolio Management Committee’ with self-organizing Internet chat-room settings that are representational of open-source innovation. Results are consistent with predictions showing that higher levels of variation are seen in the latter, despite the former’s strategic intent of innovating to stay aligned with a dynamic environment.

32098,beA — in Quarantäne?,2020-05-05,"ZUSAMMENFASSUNG: Mit einer Äthyläthylenimin‐inaktivierten und konzentrierten Aujeszky‐Virusvakzine wurden Mäuse i. m., i. n. und per Aerosol vakziniert. Mit allen drei Verabreichungsformen wurde eine unterschiedliche Immunität erzielt. Der Grad der induzierten Immunität und ihre Bestimmung waren abhängig von der Art der Applikation sowohl der Vakzinen als auch des Testinfektionsvirus. Gegenüber einer parenteralen Infektion erwies sich die i. m. Vakzination der i. n. Impfung deutlich überlegen, nach i. n. Testinfektion war die i. n. durchgeführte Immunisierung aber zumindest der i. m. gleichwertig. Eine Aerosolvakzination mit inaktiviertem Aujeszky‐Virus induzierte nur mit Adjuvanszusatz einen signifikanten Schutz, der aber im Vergleich zu den beiden anderen Applikationsarten wesentlich geringer war. Die i. n. Impfung reduzierte die Vermehrung und Ausbreitung des i. n. applizierten Testinfektionsvirus fast vollständig. Die Vakzination per Aerosol verringerte gegenüber den Kontrollen sowohl die Zahl der Lungen‐ und Gehirnisolate als auch die Virustiterhöhe in den Lungen. Neutralisierende Antikörper konnten nur im Serum i. m. und i. n. geimpfter Mäuse, aber nicht nach Aerosolvakzination nachgewiesen werden. In Lungenspülflüssigkeiten und Lungenextrakten wurden in keinem Fall neutralisierende Antikörper gefunden. SUMMARY: Possibilities of vaccination with inactivated virus via the respiratory tract studied in the Aujeszky virus — white mouse system Using an ethylethelenimin‐inactivated and concentrated Aujeszky disease virus vaccine, mice were vaccinated i. m., i. n. and by aerosol. A different immunity resulted from all three routes. The grade of immunity induced and its disposition depended both on the method of application of the vaccine and of the challenge virus. Against parenteral challenge i. m. vaccination was superior to i. n. vaccination. Using i. n. challenge i. n. vaccination was at least as good as i. m. vaccination. Aerosol vaccination with inactivated virus gave significant protection only when adjuvant was included and was in any case less effective than the other two methods of vaccination. I. n. vaccination reduced the spread and multiplication of the i. n. challenge dose almost completely. Aerosol vaccination reduced the number of lung and brain isolations and also the lung virus titres compared with the controls. Neutralizing antibodies could be found only in the sera of mice vaccinated i. m. and i. n. and not in mice vaccinated with aerosol. In lung washings and extracts no evidence of neutralizing antibodies was found on any occasion. RÉSUMÉ: Possibilité d'une vaccination par voie aérogène avec un virus inactivé de la maladie d'Aujeszky chez la souris blanche Des souris ont été vaccinées par voies i. m., i. n. et par aérosols avec un vaccin du virus d'Aujeszky concentré et inactivé à l'éthyléthylénimine. Une immunité différente fut obtenue avec les trois formes d'application. Le degré d'immunité induite et sa détermination ont dépendu du mode d'application, des vaccins et du virus de l'infection‐test. La vaccination i. m. fut supérieure à l'i. n. par rapport à une infection parentérale; l'immunisation i. n. faite après une infection‐test i. n. fut égale à l'i. m. La vaccination par aérosols avec un virus d'Aujeszky inactivé n'a donné une protection qu'avec l'addition d'un adjuvant et fut moins efficace que les deux autres méthodes. La vaccination i. n. diminua presque complètement la multiplication et l'extension du virus appliqué dans l'infection‐test. La vaccination par aérosols diminua le nombre des isolements à partir des poumons et du cerveau ainsi que la hauteur du titre viral dans les poumons par rapport aux témoins. Des anticorps neutralisants n'ont été trouvés que chez des souris vaccinées i. m. et i. n. et non chez celles vaccinées par aérosols. On n'a absolument pas trouvé d'anticorps neutralisants dans des lavages de poumons et des extraits de poumons. RESUMEN: Posibilidades de vacunación con virus inactivado a través del tracto respiratorio estudiadas en el sistema virus de Aujeszky‐ratón blanco Se vacunaron ratones blancos por las vías im., in. y con aerosoles mediante una virusvacuna de Aujeszky inactivada con etiletilenimina y concentrada. Con todas las tres formas de administración se logró una inmudidad diferente. El grado de inmunidad inducida y su valuación dependían del tipo de aplicación, tanto de las vacunas como del virus de infección de prueba. Frente a la infección parenteral se reveló la vacunación im. muy superior a la vacunación in., pero tras la infección in. de prueba era la inmunización lograda por vía in. equivalente al menos a la im. La vacunación aerosólica con virus inactivado de Aujeszky inducía solo con adición de adyuvante una protección significativa, la cual, sin embargo, era bastante inferior en comparación con los otros tipos de aplicación.äLa vacunación in. reducía asi por completo la multiplicación y difusión del virus de infección de prueba aplicado por vía in. La vacunación por medio de aerosoles disminuía frente a los testigos tanto el número de aislamientos en pulmones y cerebros como el nivel de los títulos virósicos pulmonares. Solo se pudieron identificar anticuerpos neutralizantes en el suero sanguíneo de ratones vacunados por las vías im. e in., ya que no tras vacunación aerosólica. En los líquidos de lavado pulmonar y en extractos pulmonares no se hallaron en ningún caso anticuerpos neutralizantes.","Neukirch, M.; Bauer, K.",J Vet Med B Infect Dis Vet Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7192344/,475

32446,Epidemic spreading with awareness diffusion on activity-driven networks,2018-12-28,"The maintenance and renewal of water mains demand substantial financial investments, and direct inspection of all water mains in a distribution system is extremely expensive. Therefore, a cost effective break mitigation technique such as a failure forecasting model that allows one to predict the water mains failure likelihood, would reduce the negative social impact and the cost to serve. We introduce a semiparametric Bayesian model for pipeline failure forecasting. The model is centred on a nonparametric Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), and uses a parametric survival model to capture the long-term survival probability using domain knowledge. The parametric element in our model allows the inclusion of survival probability, while the nonparametric part allows us to handle covariates and to employ incomplete prior knowledge about pipe failures. We apply our model to the proactive maintenance problem using a real dataset from a water utility in Australia. The results demonstrate that, our model performs better than competing models such as Support Vector Regression, Poisson regression, Weibull, Gradient Boosting, and GPR, leading to substantial savings on reactive repairs and maintenance. Our water pipeline failure prediction models have been deployed in three states across Australia, and are being monitored by each water authority.","Weeraddana, Dilusha; Hapuarachchi, Harini; Kumarapperuma, Lakshitha; Khoa, Nguyen Lu Dang; Cai, Chen",Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206298/,475

However, most existing methods neglect the complex correlation among data samples, which is important for capturing normal patterns from which the abnormal ones deviate. In this paper, we propose a method of Correlation aware unsupervised Anomaly detection via Deep Gaussian Mixture Model (CADGMM), which captures the complex correlation among data points for high-quality low-dimensional representation learning. More specifically, the relations among data samples are correlated firstly in forms of a graph structure, in which, the node denotes the sample and the edge denotes the correlation between two samples from the feature space. Then, a dual-encoder that consists of a graph encoder and a feature encoder, is employed to encode both the feature and correlation information of samples into the low-dimensional latent space jointly, followed by a decoder for data reconstruction. Finally, a separate estimation network as a Gaussian Mixture Model is utilized to estimate the density of the learned latent vector, and the anomalies can be detected by measuring the energy of the samples. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","Fan, Haoyi; Zhang, Fengbin; Wang, Ruidong; Xi, Liang; Li, Zuoyong",Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206313/,475

Data came from the 2014 Family Life, Activity, Sun, Health, and Eating Study (FLASHE), a cross-sectional internet study from the National Cancer Institute. Parents and their adolescent children (ages 12–17) completed surveys about demographics, physical activity, and diet; analyses include all dyads in which at least one member provided information for any of the analyzed variables (N = 1851). Actor Partner Interdependence Models in Mplus with demographic covariates tested whether parent and adolescent perceived social isolation (2 items from the UCLA Loneliness Scale) were associated with each person’s self-reported health. Most dyads included a mother (38% mother–daughter, 36% mother–son). Most parents were non-Hispanic White (69%), married/partnered (77%), and reported household income below $100,000 (79%). Both social isolation and self-reported health were significantly correlated between parents and their adolescent children (Pearson correlation = .38 for isolation, .32 for health). There were negative associations between parent isolation and parent health, adolescent isolation and adolescent health, and parent isolation and adolescent health (all ps < .05), but no association between adolescent isolation and parent health. The finding that parents’ social isolation was linked to lower self-reported health not only for themselves but also for their adolescent children highlights the importance of addressing social isolation in clinical social work practice. Family interventions, or interventions to reduce adults’ negative social cognitions or promote social connections, may improve health for both adults and their adolescent children.","Thompson, Tess; Rodebaugh, Thomas L.; Bessaha, Melissa L.; Sabbath, Erika L.",Clin Soc Work J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7222048/,475

33019,Current biology special issue: AGRI2019()(),2020-05-03,"Neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) can be an effective modality to address challenges that arise daily in the intensive care unit (ICU). These medications are often used to optimize mechanical ventilation, facilitate endotracheal intubation, stop overt shivering during therapeutic hypothermia following cardiac arrest, and may have a role in the management of life-threatening conditions such as elevated intracranial pressure and status asthmaticus (when deep sedation fails or is not tolerated). However, current NMBA use has decreased during the last decade due to concerns of potential adverse effects such as venous thrombosis, patient awareness during paralysis, development of critical illness myopathy, autonomic interactions, and even residual paralysis following cessation of NMBA use. It is therefore essential for clinicians to be familiar with evidence-based practices regarding appropriate NMBA use in order to select appropriate indications for their use and avoid complications. We believe that selecting the right NMBA, administering concomitant sedation and analgesic therapy, and using appropriate monitoring techniques mitigate these risks for critically ill patients. Therefore, we review the indications of NMBA use in the critical care setting and discuss the most appropriate use of NMBAs in the intensive care setting based on their structure, mechanism of action, side effects, and recognized clinical indications. Lastly, we highlight the available pharmacologic antagonists, strategies for sedation, newer neuromuscular monitoring techniques, and potential complications related to the use of NMBAs in the ICU setting.","Renew, J.

DBpedia and YAGO, as large cross-domain knowledge graphs, encode a subset of that knowledge by creating an entity for each page in Wikipedia, and connecting them through edges. It is well known, however, that Wikipedia-based knowledge graphs are far from complete. Especially, as Wikipedia’s policies permit pages about subjects only if they have a certain popularity, such graphs tend to lack information about less well-known entities. Information about these entities is oftentimes available in the encyclopedia, but not represented as an individual page. In this paper, we present a two-phased approach for the extraction of entities from Wikipedia’s list pages, which have proven to serve as a valuable source of information. In the first phase, we build a large taxonomy from categories and list pages with DBpedia as a backbone. With distant supervision, we extract training data for the identification of new entities in list pages that we use in the second phase to train a classification model. With this approach we extract over 700k new entities and extend DBpedia with 7.5M new type statements and 3.8M new facts of high precision.","Heist, Nicolas; Paulheim, Heiko",The Semantic Web,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7250619/,475

The data fusion process begins by quantifying sensor data by belief masses. Thereafter, these masses are combined in order to provide more accurate information. Finally, a probabilistic approximation of these combined masses is done to make-decision on associations. Several probabilistic transformations have been proposed in the literature. However, to the best of our knowledge, these transformations have been evaluated only on simulated examples. For this reason, the objective of this paper is to benchmark most of interesting probabilistic transformations on real-data in order to evaluate their performances for the autonomous vehicle perception problematic.","Boumediene, Mohammed; Dezert, Jean",Information Processing and Management of Uncertainty in Knowledge-Based Systems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7274716/,475

However, it is not clear which equivalence is the most suitable for the purpose. Indeed, several definitions of some properties are proposed. For example, the definition of privacy is not unique. This situation means that we are not certain how to express an intuitive security notion. Namely, there is a gap between an intuitive security notion and the formulation. Proper formalization is essential for verification, and our purpose is to bridge this gap. In the case of the applied pi calculus, an outputted message is not explicitly expressed. This feature suggests that trace equivalence appropriately expresses indistinguishability for attackers in the applied pi calculus. By chasing interchanging bound names and scope extrusions, we prove that trace equivalence is a congruence. Therefore, a security property expressed using trace equivalence is preserved by application of contexts. Moreover, we construct an epistemic logic for the applied pi calculus. We show that its logical equivalence agrees with trace equivalence. It means that trace equivalence is suitable in the presence of a non-adaptive attacker. Besides, we define several security properties to use our epistemic logic.","Minami, Kiraku","Formal Techniques for Distributed Objects, Components, and Systems",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7281862/,475

However, little is known about the potential application of TLR agonists for immunotherapy against Trichinella spiralis (T. spiralis) infection. Here, we evaluated the effects of four TLR agonists (i.e., TLR3, TLR4, TLR8, and TLR9 agonists) on T. spiralis infection in mice. The reduction rate of worm burden showed that TLR3 agonist poly(I:C) significantly reduced T. spiralis infection rather than TLR4, TLR8, and TLR9 agonists (p < 0.05). Moreover, TLR3 showed a continuous high-level of expression during 6–35 days post infection (dpi). The levels of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), interleukin (IL)-2, and IL-6 increased significantly in mice serum compared with control group after treatment with TLR3 agonist at 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 28, and 35 dpi (p < 0.05).

Three main themes emerged from the qualitative interviews among these cisgender women living with HIV: (1) “They kept away”: Experiences with social isolation; (2) “I thought people would think badly about me”: Perceived experiences of discrimination; and (3) “I will live till I die”: Suicidality, resilience, and gaining hope. Our findings reinforce the need for emphasis on culturally appropriate interventions for depression for cisgender women living with HIV in India, including greater access to mental health resources, greater availability of trained counselors that share the same gender and are native speakers of Hindi or Telugu, and increased family and community support for socially isolated individuals.","Azhar, Sameena; Gandham, Sabitha; Vaudrey, Jason; Oruganti, Ganesh; Samuel, Revina Suhasini",Clin Soc Work J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7315697/,475
35656,Formal Proof of the Group Law for Edwards Elliptic Curves,2020-06-06,"BACKGROUND: Pathological skin scars, caused by cesarean section, affected younger mothers esthetically and psychosocially and to some extent frustrated obstetricians and dermatologists. Umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs), as a population of multipotent cells, are abundant in human tissues, providing several possibilities for their effects on skin scar tissues. Herein, we performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, three-arm clinical trial, aiming to assess the efficacy and safety of UC-MSCs in the treatment of cesarean section skin scars among primiparous singleton pregnant women. METHODS: Ninety primiparous singleton pregnant women undergoing elective cesarean section were randomly allocated to receive placebo, low-dose (3 × 10(6) cells), or high-dose (6 × 10(6) cells) transdermal hydrogel UC-MSCs on the surface of the skin incision. The primary outcome was cesarean section skin scars followed after the sixth month, assessed by the Vancouver Scar Scale (VSS). RESULTS: All the participants completed their trial of the primary outcome according to the protocol. The mean score of estimated total VSS was 5.52 in all participants at the sixth-month follow-up, with 6.43 in the placebo group, 5.18 in the low-dose group, and 4.71 in the high-dose group, respectively. No significant difference was found between-group in the mean scores for VSS at the sixth month. Additional prespecified secondary outcomes were not found with significant differences among groups either. No obvious side effects or adverse effects were reported in any of the three arms. CONCLUSION: This randomized clinical trial showed that UC-MSCs did not demonstrate the effects of improvement of cesarean section skin scars.

Its propensity to affect the terminal ileum and to spread to regional lymph nodes explains the potential misdiagnosis with appendicitis. METHODS: We reviewed the Y. enterocoliticainfection cases in a pediatric population for the last 12 years. RESULTS: There were 11 cases of Y. enterocolitica infection in the selected period. Four patients had a suspected surgical diagnosis: 1 intussusception, 3 acute appendicitis. Patients who presented with appendicitis-like features were older, whereas younger children most commonly presented with diarrhea and fever. Ultrasound and abdominal computed tomography (CT) were performed in appendicitis-like patients and ruled out appendicitis in 2 of the 3 cases. The only patient submitted to surgery had abnormal CT findings and an important risk factor for this infection that was not recognized at presentation. CONCLUSION: This condition should be considered in patients with known risk factors (such as iron overload) and with the right epidemiological setting when presenting with abdominal symptoms. The suspicion of this diagnosis in these particular cases might obviate unnecessary surgical interventions.","Fernandes, Sara; Vasconcelos-Castro, Sofia; Teixeira, Cláudia; Soares-Oliveira, Miguel",GE Port J Gastroenterol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7316665/,475

36183,Approximate Reaction Systems Based on Rough Set Theory,2020-06-10,"A key writing skill is the capability to clearly convey desired meaning using available linguistic knowledge. Consequently, writers must select from a large array of idioms, vocabulary terms that are semantically equivalent, and discourse features that simultaneously reflect content and allow readers to grasp meaning. In many cases, a simplified version of a text is needed to ensure comprehension on the part of a targeted audience (e.g., second language learners). To address this need, we propose an automated method to simplify texts based on paraphrasing. Specifically, we explore the potential for a deep learning model, previously used for machine translation, to learn a simplified version of the English language within the context of short phrases. The best model, based on an Universal Transformer architecture, achieved a BLEU score of 66.01. We also evaluated this model’s capability to perform similar transformation to texts that were simplified by human experts at different levels.","Botarleanu, Robert-Mihai; Dascalu, Mihai; Crossley, Scott Andrew; McNamara, Danielle S.",Artificial Intelligence in Education,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7334681/,475

Combined with novel unsupervised pre-training tasks such as masked language modeling, sentence ordering or next sentence prediction, those natural language processing models became even more accurate. In this work, we experiment with fine-tuning different pre-trained Transformer based architectures.

The students were labeled with the anxiety categories both PSA and FLA, PSA more, FLA more, or no anxiety. To classify the ELLs into their respective anxiety categories, prominent EDA features were employed that supported the predictions of anxiety sources. These results may encourage both ELLs and instructors to be aware of the origins of anxiety subtypes and develop a customized practice for public speaking in a foreign language.","Lee, Heera; Mandalapu, Varun; Kleinsmith, Andrea; Gong, Jiaqi",Artificial Intelligence in Education,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7334690/,475

In fact, during the Coronovirus pandemic, online curation of resources provides teachers a repository of materials to provide students in online space. Teachers’ engagement online then provides the ability to learn more about how teachers are addressing students’ learning needs and potentially improve the quality of the resources they share. Historically, to perform such a study, we often survey some teachers and then leverage their shared resources to investigate education-related research questions. However, this can lead to problems including sample representativeness where surveyed teachers may not be representative of the population of teachers in social media. In this paper, we attempt to improve the sample representativeness of teachers on Pinterest. We first survey 541 teachers in the United States as seed samples and then collect their online data and social connections on Pinterest. Then, we devise a heuristic that automatically identifies other Pinterest accounts that are likely to be teachers thus improving the sample representativeness. Finally, we evaluate our heuristic with advanced machine learning techniques.","Karimi, Hamid; Derr, Tyler; Torphy, Kaitlin T.; Frank, Kenneth A.; Tang, Jiliang",Artificial Intelligence in Education,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7334730/,475

Theoretically, under common heuristic assumptions we show how to solve SVP in dimension d with a cost proportional to running a sieve in dimension [Formula: see text], resulting in a [Formula: see text] speedup and memory reduction compared to running a full sieve. Combined with techniques from [Ducas, Eurocrypt 2018] we can asymptotically get a total of [Formula: see text] dimensions for free for solving SVP. Practically, the main obstacles for observing a speedup in moderate dimensions appear to be that the leading constant in the [Formula: see text] term is rather small; that the overhead of the (batched) slicer may be large; and that competitive enumeration algorithms heavily rely on aggressive pruning techniques, which appear to be incompatible with our algorithms. These obstacles prevented this asymptotic speedup (compared to full sieving) from being observed in our experiments. However, it could be expected to become visible once optimized CVPP techniques are used in higher dimensional experiments.","Doulgerakis, Emmanouil; Laarhoven, Thijs; de Weger, Benne",Progress in Cryptology - AFRICACRYPT 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7335001/,475

However, the formal utility of CVP measurement in preventing mortality in septic patients has never been proven. METHODS: The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database was searched to identify septic patients with and without CVP measurements. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. Multivariate regression was used to elucidate the relationship between CVP measurement and 28-day mortality, and propensity score matching (PSM) and an inverse probability of treatment weighing (IPTW) were employed to validate our findings. RESULTS: A total of 10,275 patients were included in our study, of which 4516 patients (44%) underwent CVP measurement within 24 h of intensive care unit (ICU) admission. The risk of 28-day mortality was reduced in the CVP group (OR 0.60 (95% CI 0.51–0.70; p < 0.001)). Patients in the CVP group received more fluid on day 1 and had a shorter duration of mechanical ventilation and vasopressor use, and the reduction in serum lactate was greater than that in the no CVP group. The mediating effect of serum lactate reduction was significant for the whole cohort (p = 0.04 for the average causal mediation effect (ACME)) and patients in the CVP group with an initial CVP level below 8 mmHg (p = 0.04 for the ACME). CONCLUSION: CVP measurement was associated with decreased risk-adjusted 28-day mortality among patients with sepsis and was proportionally mediated through serum lactate reduction.","Chen, Hui; Zhu, Zhu; Zhao, Chenyan; Guo, Yanxia; Chen, Dongyu; Wei, Yao; Jin, Jun",Crit Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7358999/,475

40622,People + Companies,2020-10-09,"A hegemon can destroy its international regimes, but what happens when it does not possess the capacity to reconstitute a regime to its liking? Drawing on structural power theory, our article examines President Nixon’s historic attacks on the Bretton Woods international monetary regime to help illuminate President Trump’s attacks on the World Trade Organisation (WTO). In both cases regime destruction was driven to a large extent by a desire to contain rivals: Europe for Nixon, China for Trump. Drawing on original archival material, our case study analysis shows that while the United States possessed sufficient negative structural power to derail Bretton Woods, it lacked sufficient positive structural power to create the new monetary structure Nixon wanted. Trump faces a similar dilemma: he can block the WTO regime, but cannot necessarily replace it with one to the United States’ liking. China is too powerful and possesses too much structural power of its own to give up its WTO privileges without a fight. After the Coronavirus pandemic, it is unlikely that China can prevent the United States from wrecking the WTO trade regime, but very likely it can block US attempts to create a successor regime tailored exclusively to US requirements.","Stokes, Doug; Williamson, Martin",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7543319/,475
40965,Im Austausch über MS-Marker und Therapien,2020-10-26,"BACKGROUND: The poultry red mite Dermanyssus gallinae (De Geer, 1778) is a major ectoparasite of poultry. Infestations are found in most laying hen farms in Europe, and breeder flocks have also been reported to be affected. Mite infestation has detrimental effects on animal welfare, it causes significant economic losses, and, additionally, D. gallinae is often considered as a vector for pathogens. Despite suspicion of a close relationship between the poultry red mite and Salmonella enterica enterica serovar Gallinarum biovar Gallinarum (serovar Gallinarum), the causative agent of fowl typhoid disease (FT), there has been no definitive proof of mite-mediated transmission. Therefore, an investigation was conducted to determine if D. gallinae-mediated transmission of serovar Gallinarum could be demonstrated among four different hen groups. METHODS: Two groups of 8 hens (A and B) were experimentally infected with serovar Gallinarum in two isolators. After 7 days, when birds showed signs of FT, about 25,000 mites were introduced. After 3 days, mites were harvested and used to infest two other hen groups of 8 (C and D), in two separate isolators. The health status of hens was constantly monitored; detection and quantification of serovar Gallinarum were performed by PCR and qPCR from mites and organs of dead hens. The maximum likelihood estimation of the infection rate and mite vectorial capacity were calculated. RESULTS: Clinical disease was observed in groups infected with serovar Gallinarum (A and B) and in hens of groups C and D infested with mites harvested from the isolators containing groups A and B. In all four groups, serovar Gallinarum was detected from liver, spleen, ovary, and cecum of hens, thus confirming the diagnosis of FT. Mite analysis demonstrated the presence of the pathogen, with an estimated infection rate ranging between 13.72 and 55.21 infected per thousand mites. Vectorial capacity was estimated to be 73.79. CONCLUSIONS: Mites harvested from birds infected with serovar Gallinarum were shown to carry the mite, and then to transfer serovar Gallinarum to isolated groups of pathogen-free birds that subsequently showed signs of FT. Mite vectorial capacity was high, demonstrating that D. gallinae should be considered an effective vector of FT.

Specifically, there appears to be a sex-based divide in mask wearing, with men more likely to resist wearing masks. Utilizing an original survey, we test the correlation between masculinity and mask wearing.

We sought to understand willingness to use actual and hypothetical HIV prevention methods among participants enrolled in a preventative HIV vaccine efficacy trial in Soweto, South Africa. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative study with 38 self-reporting HIV-uninfected and consenting 18–35 year olds participating in the HVTN 702 vaccine efficacy trial in Soweto. Using a semi-structured interview guide, five focus group discussions (FGDs) were held, stratified by age, gender and sexual orientation. The FGDs were composed of: (i) 10 heterosexual women aged 18–24 years; (ii) 9 heterosexual and bisexual women aged 25–35 years; (iii & iv) heterosexual men aged 25–35 years with 7 in both groups; and (v) 5 men aged 18–35 years who have sex with men. FGDs were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, translated into English and analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: We present five main themes: (i) long-lasting methods are preferable; (ii) condoms are well-known but not preferred for use; (iii) administration route of HIV prevention method is a consideration for the user; (iv) ideal HIV prevention methods should blend into the lifestyle of the user; and the perception that (v) visible prevention methods indicate sexual indiscretion. CONCLUSIONS: The participants’ candour about barriers to condom and daily oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) use, and expressed preferences for long-lasting, discreet, lifestyle-friendly methods reveal a gap in the biomedical prevention market aiming to reduce sexually acquired HIV in South Africa. Product developers should consider long-acting injectable formulations, such as vaccines, passive antibodies and chemoprophylaxis, for HIV prevention technologies. Future innovations in HIV prevention products may need to address the desire for the method to blend easily into lifestyles, such as food-medication formulations.","Laher, Fatima; Salami, Taibat; Hornschuh, Stefanie; Makhale, Lerato M.; Khunwane, Mamakiri; Andrasik, Michele P.; Gray, Glenda E.; Van Tieu, Hong; Dietrich, Janan J.",BMC Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7648553/,475

There are many bacterial phyla with no cultivated examples including most members of the Candidate Phylum Radiation with the exception of human oral isolates from the phylum Saccharibacteria. AIMS: The aims of this research were to develop reproducible methods and validate approaches for the cultivation of human oral Saccharibacteria and to identify the conceptual pitfalls that delayed isolation of these bacteria for 20 years after their discovery. METHODS: Oral samples were dispersed and passed through 0.2 µm membrane filters. The ultrasmall saccharibacterial cells in the filtrate were pelleted, inoculated into broth cultures of potential bacterial host cells and passaged into fresh medium every 2–3 days. RESULTS: Thirty-two isolates representing four species of Saccharibacteria were isolated in stable coculture with three species of host bacteria from the phylum Actinobacteria. Complete genome sequences were obtained for 16 isolates. CONCLUSIONS: Human oral Saccharibacteria are obligate bacterial parasites that can be stably passaged in coculture with specific species of host bacteria. Isolating these important members of the human oral microbiome, and many natural environments, requires abandoning many of Koch’s concepts and methods and embracing novel microbiological approaches.","Murugkar, Pallavi P.; Collins, Andrew J.; Chen, Tsute; Dewhirst, Floyd E.",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7651992/,475

DATA: National and local statistics on US traffic volume, traffic fatalities, injury accidents, speeding violations, running of stop signs, and other indicators of vehicular driving behavior, both in 2020 and in previous US economic recessions affecting the volume of road traffic. METHODS: Comparative analysis of the similarities and differences between the data for the COVID-19 lockdown in parts of the USA in March 2020 and similar data for the 2008–2009 global economic crisis, as well as other US cases of major reductions in traffic volume. FINDINGS: The volume of traffic contracted sharply once a COVID-19 national emergency was declared and most states issued stay-at-home orders, but motor vehicle fatality rates, injury accidents, and speeding violations went up, and remained elevated even as traffic began returning toward normal. This pattern does not fit post-World War II recessions where fatality rates declined with the volume of traffic nor does the 2020 pattern match the pattern during World War II when traffic dropped substantially with little change in motor vehicle fatality rates. CONCLUSIONS: The findings are consistent with a theory of social distancing on highways undermining compliance with social norms, a social cost of COVID which, if not corrected, poses potential long-term increases in non-compliance and dangerous driving.","Meyer, Marshall W.",Camb J Evid Based Polic,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7751747/,475

We assessed demographics, comorbidities, presenting symptoms, treatments and outcomes and compared pts who died during hospitalization to those who survived to discharge (EpiInfo 7.2, Atlanta, GA). RESULTS: Mean age was 60.5 years, 51.6% were female, 72% African American (AA) and 69.6% admitted from home. 54.5% had a BMI >30, 72% had HTN, 47.2% diabetes, and 33.6% COPD or asthma. The majority (68.8%) presented with fever (>38.0) and required supplemental oxygen within 8 hours of admission (63.4%). Cough (65.6%), dyspnea (57.5%), myalgias (30.6%) and diarrhea (23.8%) were also common. 40.4% received hydroxychloroquine, 23.6% steroids and 19.9% convalescent plasma. 42.9% required ICU care, 27.3% were intubated, and 19.3% died. Characteristics associated with death included older age, male sex, HTN, ESRD on HD, and cancer. Symptoms associated with death included absence of cough, absence of myalgias, previous admission for COVID-19, tachypnea, need for supplemental oxygen, elevated BUN and creatinine, and elevated ferritin. Interventions associated with death included use of steroids, receipt of ICU care, intubation, delay to intubation, and use of vasopressors or inotropes.

44465,The Recent Past and Possible Futures of Citizen Science: Final Remarks,2020-08-29,"BACKGROUND: Improving quality of care is a key priority to reduce neonatal mortality and stillbirths. The Safe Care, Saving Lives programme aimed to improve care in newborn care units and labour wards of 60 public and private hospitals in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, India, using a collaborative quality improvement approach. Our external evaluation of this programme aimed to evaluate programme effects on implementation of maternal and newborn care practices, and impact on stillbirths, 7- and 28-day neonatal mortality rate in labour wards and neonatal care units. We also aimed to evaluate programme implementation and mechanisms of change. METHODS: We used a quasi-experimental plausibility design with a nested process evaluation. We evaluated effects on stillbirths, mortality and secondary outcomes relating to adherence to 20 evidence-based intrapartum and newborn care practices, comparing survey data from 29 hospitals receiving the intervention to 31 hospitals expected to receive the intervention later, using a difference-in-difference analysis. We analysed programme implementation data and conducted 42 semi-structured interviews in four case studies to describe implementation and address four theory-driven questions to explain the quantitative results. RESULTS: Only 7 of the 29 intervention hospitals were engaged in the intervention for its entire duration. There was no evidence of an effect of the intervention on stillbirths [DiD − 1.3 percentage points, 95% CI − 2.6–0.1], on neonatal mortality at age 7 days [DiD − 1.6, 95% CI − 9–6.2] or 28 days [DiD − 3.0, 95% CI − 12.9—6.9] or on adherence to target evidence-based intrapartum and newborn care practices. The process evaluation identified challenges in engaging leaders; challenges in developing capacity for quality improvement; and challenges in activating mechanisms of change at the unit level, rather than for a few individuals, and in sustaining these through the creation of new social norms. CONCLUSION: Despite careful planning and substantial resources, the intervention was not feasible for implementation on a large scale. Greater focus is required on strategies to engage leadership. Quality improvement may need to be accompanied by clinical training. Further research is also needed on quality improvement using a health systems perspective.

Neurotrophic keratopathy is an uncommon consequence of dorsolateral medullary infarction. At present, the protocol is aimed to study the dynamic changes in corneal innervation and the ocular surface environment after dorsolateral medullary infarction. METHODS: This study will involve consecutive data from all medical records of patients within 7 days of acute dorsolateral medullary infarction onset at the Departments of Neurology from 10 collaborating stroke centers. Eligible patients will mainly be characterized based on detailed physical examinations, multimodal imaging, and corneal related examinations and patients will be followed-up for 2 years. Neurotrophic keratopathy after dorsolateral medullary infarction is the primary endpoint. The dynamic histological corneal innervation and ocular surface environment after dorsolateral medullary infarction will be observed during the follow-up period. DISCUSSION: This multicentric, prospective registry is the first to identify and characterize the dynamic changes of corneal innervation and the ocular surface environment after acute dorsolateral medullary infarction. The significance of the study is to emphasize that the curative effect is based on the doctors’ identification of the disease in the earliest stage before irreversible damage occurs to the cornea.

45416,Paradigm Shift in E/E Architectures Leads to Risky Dependencies,2021-02-05,"This paper explores the main drivers of firms’ external competitiveness in times of crisis. We focus on the aftermath of the Great Recession (2008–2015) and present evidence based on a comprehensive survey of Italian companies (the MET dataset). Overall, our results highlight not only the strict correlation between internationalization and innovative activities but also a positive change of attitude of Italian firms towards these strategies. We show that, while structural factors play a key role for external competitiveness, other critical aspects trigger superior performances, especially strategic profiles, technological capabilities, and proactive behaviors such as innovativeness and R&D investment.

45907,Negotiating Vulnerabilities in Space and Time in the Twenty-First Century,2021-02-18,"The scarcity of fully-annotated data becomes the biggest obstacle that prevents many deep learning approaches from widely applied. Weakly-supervised visual learning which can utilize inexact annotations is developed rapidly to remedy such a situation. In this paper, we study the weakly-supervised task achieving pixel-level semantic segmentation only with image-level labels as supervision. Different from other methods, our approach tries to transform the weakly-supervised visual learning problem into a semi-supervised visual learning problem and then utilizes semi-supervised learning methods to solve it. Utilizing this transformation, we can adopt effective semi-supervised methods to perform transductive learning with context information. In the semi-supervised learning module, we propose to use the graph cut algorithm to label more supervision from the activation seeds generated from a classification network. The generated labels can provide the segmentation model with effective supervision information; moreover, the graph cut module can benefit from features extracted by the segmentation model. Then, each of them updates and optimizes the other iteratively until convergence. Experiment results on PASCAL VOC and COCO benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed deep graph cut algorithm for weakly-supervised semantic segmentation.","Feng, Jiapei; Wang, Xinggang; Liu, Wenyu",Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7881314/,475

46106,News,2021-02-25,"This paper introduces liquid consumer utopias, defined as market-mediated expressions of individuals’ desires to re-imagine and re-construct reality, and to re-frame the present. This conceptual lens illuminates previously untheorized consumption phenomena, which are socially constructed, and often critical, efforts to enact an alternative way of being in an increasingly uncertain and unpredictable world. Three key characteristics of liquid utopias are outlined—immediacy, transience and hyper-individualization––each pointing to liquid consumer utopias’ function to facilitate present-oriented and short-lived re-imaginings of reality. Co-existing alongside the solid and collective utopian consumption of interest to prior research, these emergent forms of liquid consumer utopias articulate a re-imagining of the present (rather than the future), have an emphasis on individual (rather than communal) experiences of betterment, and an orientation toward temporary re-framings of the experienced reality (rather than a pursuit of permanence and long-lasting change). Implications are discussed for retailing, experiential consumption, and consumer self-optimization.","Atanasova, Aleksandrina",AMS Rev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7892714/,475
46220,Pflege Markt,2021-03-05,"The article discusses German families’ economic situation in the first months of the current COVID 19 crisis from mid-March to mid-May, 2020. Family incomes are at high risk because of unemployment and short-time work. Recently introduced adjustments of the “Infektionsschutzgesetz” (Protection Against Infection Act) that established a claim for wage replacements for parents who have to provide childcare and home schooling for their children, due to the lockdown of kindergartens and schools, only partially compensate incurred losses. Further, far from all parents are entitled to the statutory short-time allowance, nor do recipients benefit to the same extent, and the approved upgrade of the replacement rate will only gradually become active. Moreover, public family-related measures such as the “Notfall-Kinderzuschlag” (emergency child supplement) and facilitations concerning parental leave entitlements during the crisis will only partly absorb the experienced income reductions. On the other hand, families’ daily expenses remain unchanged. While struggling how to make ends meet, families are confronted with a second burden, the challenge to reconcile domestic needs with job requirements. As first evidence suggests, women will bear the lion’s share of the crisis’ extra unpaid work for families. A prolongation of wage replacements for some extra weeks will relieve parents’ financial concerns, but a stepwise reopening of the child and youth welfare system, schools and the business sector remains essential for parents’ ability to return to work and to sustain their livelihood.","Boll, Christina",List Forum,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7901168/,475

This is because the UK House of Commons enjoys unparalleled visibility in the UK democratic system. Calls to strengthen the UK House of Commons as a democratic actor and leader on gender equality should attend to it as a co-professional organisational setting—that is, not as a unitary actor but composed of different categories and demographics of staff. The gendered terms of arrangements that structure the relationships between these actors are important, not only for a just everyday working life but for legislative outcomes too. This chapter offers some final reflections on the book’s contributions—notably how feminist discursive institutionalist approaches combined with parliamentary ethnography makes for a compelling lens to explore gender and power in parliaments. Drawing on the empirical chapters, the chapter considers five possibilities for parliamentary reform, conceiving of agency as identity-contingent. Although the chapter highlights possibilities for endogenous change, it considers how COVID-19 might affect institutional reform in the UK House of Commons. Overall, this book contributes one discussion towards the broader international feminist project to re-future parliamentary democracy.","Miller, Cherry M.",Gendering the Everyday in the UK House of Commons,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7971586/,475

It is expressed by the level of systematic risk in the economy and part of the expected return on investment. It only exists because it is impossible to estimate the future values of a selected investment and it expresses a certain degree of uncertainty. The aim of the paper is to compare the calculation methods used for the risk premium of the Czech Republic.

The modified concept of the CAPM model according to Damodaran seems to be most appropriate for the Czech Republic. The model includes a country risk premium. However, the size of a company must be taken into account and the recommended market volatility coefficient of 1.5 may have to be adjusted to a higher value. However, no exact rules of procedure are available to clearly determine which models would be most appropriate for use.

Through this, a BDD-based Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solver can generate a checkable proof of unsatisfiability. Such proofs indicate that the formula is truly unsatisfiable without requiring the user to trust the BDD package or the SAT solver built on top of it. We extend their work to enable arbitrary existential quantification of the formula variables, a critical capability for BDD-based SAT solvers. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by applying a prototype solver to obtain polynomially sized proofs on benchmarks for the mutilated chessboard and pigeonhole problems—ones that are very challenging for search-based SAT solvers.","Bryant, Randal E.; Heule, Marijn J.

In the first stage of the project, besides the development of custom-built, low-cost data collectors, ultrasonic transducers are embedded in a large, reinforced concrete specimen on a BAM test site near Berlin. In this experiment, the influence of changing environmental conditions (mainly temperature) on the ultrasound signal is investigated using coda-wave interferometry. The results show a correlation between changes in temperature and ultrasonic velocity. Such changes must be taken into consideration in a long-term monitoring setup to distinguish between reversible and permanent changes. By correcting the data using a linear relation between concrete temperature and velocity change to remove the seasonal trends and by low-pass filtering the data to remove daily variations can remove most of the temperature influence on the ultrasound measurements.","Epple, Niklas; Barroso, Daniel Fontoura; Niederleithinger, Ernst",European Workshop on Structural Health Monitoring,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7981451/,475

Degradation of air, water and soil, destruction of natural habitat, and compounded loss of floral and faunal diversity has been a major cause of worry among environmentalist. Measures adopted to address these issues have not yielded result on expected lines. But the year 2020 turned out to be a blessing in disguise for the environment.

Multiple values are created through this process including profit or economic rents and surplus value, but also social, community and individual benefits. This chapter uses case studies to explore how different processes work together within service businesses to create value. Five contrasting integrated cases are explored: Rolls-Royce, Flowserve, TikTok, Inditex (including Zara) and Dubai. The last case, Dubai, explores the development of a city-region and the role service businesses play within city-regions. In this account, we explore three dimensions of Dubai: as a service economy, as a location for service spaces—The Dubai Mall—and of service businesses. Here the challenge is to explore the ways in which an observer can ‘read’ a city-region as a service space and can read a particular servicescape—a shopping mall.

Sea level rise and increased precipitation drive regular flooding events and the erosion of islands and coastal features. This results in the loss of habitat for various species of birds and fishes. Increased temperatures extend the growing season and reduce the incidence of frosts. Rising water temperatures accommodate the immigration of warm-adapted species and endanger populations of cold ones. Increased temperature interacts with cultural eutrophication to extend the duration and extent of seasonal hypoxia. Higher regional temperatures threaten human health, particularly populations of poorer residents that lack refuge from heatwaves and flooding events. Acidification of the Bay, which is linked to climate change agents, endangers species that rely upon calcium carbonate for shell and skeleton. Emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs, primarily CO(2), NO(2), CH(4)) from human economic activity drives climate change. The food system accounts for 25–30% of human GHGs emissions. Half of these comes from livestock, which contribute 14.5% of the global anthropogenic GHG load. Eliminating animal-based foods, particularly ruminants (cattle) would facilitate building a sustainable food system with improved health outcomes for the residents of the Chesapeake Bay Region.","Cuker, Benjamin E.; St. Laurent, Kari; Coles, Victoria J.; Gerbing, Dawn",Diet for a Sustainable Ecosystem,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8011601/,475

While there has been moderate amount of research on PWID who assist with first injections, most of this research has focused on identifying characteristics of PWID who assist with first injections. We do not have a formal model that describes how the minority of PWID come to assist do so, while the majority never assist. Through comparison of persons who did or did not recently assist with first injections using data from PWID in Tallinn, Estonia (N = 286) and Staten Island, New York City (N = 101), we developed a formal multi-stage model of how PWID come to assist with first injections. The model had a primary pathway 1) of engaging in “injection promoting” behaviors, 2) being asked to assist, and 3) assisting. Statistical testing using odds ratios showed participation in each stage was strongly associated with participation in the next stage (all odds ratios >3.0) and the probabilities of assisting significantly increased with participation in the successive stages. We then used the model to compare engagement in the stages pre-vs. post participation in an intervention, and to compare persons who recently assisted to persons who had assisted in the past but had not recently assisted and to persons who had never assisted. Advantages of a formal model for how current PWID come to assist with first injections include: facilitating comparisons across different PWID populations and assessing strengths and limitations of interventions to reduce assisting with first injections.","Des Jarlais, Don C.; Arasteh, Kamyar; Barnes, David M.; Feelemyer, Jonathan; Berg, Hayley; Raag, Mait; Talu, Ave; Org, Greete; Tross, Susan; Uuskula, Anneli",Front Sociol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8022482/,475

Der Paradigmenwechsel vom Kosmopolitismus zur Kosmo-Politik,2021-04-16,"BACKGROUND: Obesity has become a global epidemic problem affecting every system and is associated with many consequences including coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, obstructive sleep apnea, and socioeconomic and psychosocial impairment. Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy is one of the best and most commonly done operations for weight loss. Elevated peak airway pressure and hypoxemia are common problems that anesthesiologists face during laparoscopic surgeries with conventional volume-controlled ventilation. This study aimed at the use of the prolonged I:E ratio as an alternative strategy to improve gas exchange and the respiratory mechanics of obese patients undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. RESULTS: The study was a prospective randomized controlled trial and was performed between April 2019 and March 2020. After the approval of the departmental ethical committee and the informed written consent had been taken from the patients, fifty-two obese patients undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy were enrolled in this study. After endotracheal intubation, the patients were randomly divided into the IRV group (n=26) and the VCV group (n=26). Respiratory parameters were adjusted as tidal volume (Vt) 8mL/kg ideal body weight, respiratory rate 12 breaths/min, positive-end expiratory pressure (PEEP) 0, fractional inspired oxygen (FiO(2)) 0.6, and I:E ratio 1:2 for the VCV group and 2:1 for the IRV group; hemodynamics and respiratory mechanics were monitored and recorded after intubation (0 min), before pneumoperitoneum (10 mins), and after pneumoperitoneum (20 mins), 30, 40, 50, and 60 mins. IRV significantly improves the respiratory mechanics during pneumoperitoneum in the form of decreasing the peak pressure (Ppeak) and plateau pressure (Pplat) and improving the dynamic compliance, but the mean pressure (Pmean) was increased; it also increased the partial pressure of oxygen (arterial PO(2)) significantly. No statistical significance was found regarding the demographic data or the hemodynamics. CONCLUSION: IRV is superior to conventional VCV in morbidly obese patients undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy as it improves respiratory mechanics and oxygenation.","Sayed, Noha Hussein; Elaziz, Mohamed Saeed Abd; Elkholy, Amgad Serag; Taeimah, Mohamed Osman",Ain-Shams J Anesthesiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8042839/,475

The growing global problem of antibiotic resistance of microbial pathogens wherein microbes become resistant to the very antibiotics used against them during infection is linked not only to our health uses but also to agribusiness practices and the changing environment. Here we review mechanisms of microbial iron acquisition and host iron withdrawal defense, and the influence of iron withdrawal on the antimicrobial activity of antibiotics. Antibiotic-resistant microbes are unaltered in their iron requirements, but iron withdrawal from microbes enhances the activities of various antibiotics and importantly suppresses outgrowth of antibiotic-exposed resistant microbial survivors. Of the three therapeutic approaches available to exploit microbial iron susceptibility, including (1) use of gallium as a non-functional iron analogue, (2) Trojan horse conjugates of microbial siderophores carrying antibiotics, and (3) new generation iron chelators, purposely designed as anti-microbials, the latter offers various advantages. For instance, these novel anti-microbial chelators overcome the limitations of conventional clinically-used hematological chelators which display host toxicity and are not useful antimicrobials. 3-Hydroxypyridin-4-one-containing polymeric chelators appear to have the highest potential. DIBI (developmental code name) is a well-developed lead candidate, being a low molecular weight, water-soluble copolymer with enhanced iron binding characteristics, strong anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory activities, low toxicity for animals and demonstrated freedom from microbial resistance development. DIBI has been shown to enhance antibiotic efficacy for antibiotic-resistant microbes during infection, and it also prevents recovery growth and resistance development during microbe exposure to various antibiotics. Because DIBI bolsters innate iron withdrawal defenses of the infected host, it has potential to provide a host-directed anti-infective therapy.","Holbein, Bruce E.; Ang, M.

52177,New certification requirement for autopsies: few things to consider,2021-01-28,"Phasing out fossil fuel dependency to adopt renewable energy technologies is pertinent for both ensuring energy security and for safeguarding the well-being of the environment. However, financial constraints often restrict the developing countries, in particular, from undergoing the renewable energy transition that is necessary for easing the environmental hardships. Against this background, this study makes a novel attempt to evaluate the impacts of FDI inflows on enhancing renewable energy use and attaining environmental sustainability in Bangladesh between 1972 and 2015. Using the autoregressive distributed lags with structural break approach to estimate the short- and long-run elasticities, it is found that FDI inflows enhance the share of renewable electricity output in the total electricity output levels of the country. Besides, FDI inflows are also evidenced to directly hamper environmental quality by boosting the ecological footprints figures of Bangladesh. Hence, it can be said that FDI promotes renewable electricity generation in Bangladesh but transforms the nation into a pollution haven. However, although FDI inflows cannot directly reduce the ecological footprints, a joint ecological footprint mitigation impact of FDI inflows and renewable electricity generation is evidenced. Besides, the findings also verify the authenticity of the Environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesis in Bangladesh’s context. Therefore, economic growth can be referred to as being both the cause and the panacea to the environmental problems faced by Bangladesh. These results, in a nutshell, calls for effective measures to be undertaken for attracting the relatively cleaner FDI in Bangladesh whereby the objectives of renewable energy transition and environmental sustainability can be achieved in tandem. In line with these findings, several appropriate financial globalization policies are recommended.","Murshed, Muntasir; Elheddad, Mohamed; Ahmed, Rizwan; Bassim, Mohga; Than, Ei Thuzar",Asia-Pac Financ Markets,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8071756/,475

Cities produce less greenhouse gas emissions per capita than suburbs. Meanwhile, the US and the world have been wrestling with the public health emergency of the COVID-19 pandemic. But as US cities recover from the pandemic, they are unlikely to add more population than their suburbs because of changes in favor of working from home, online shopping, and the search for more affordable housing and green space, as well as concerns about population density and contagious diseases. So, the challenge is how to design and redevelop suburbs to make them more environmentally, socially, and economically sustainable to address both climate change and the threat of future pandemics. A sustainable suburb scenario offers an alternative to the sprawling development, separation of land uses and income classes, and automobile dependence that characterizes the typical American suburban landscape. This essay reviews the literature on re-designing suburbs and describes and evaluates both a business-as-usual suburb scenario and a sustainable suburb scenario. Though challenges exist, sustainable suburbs will be needed in order to reduce US greenhouse gas emissions, to achieve greater resilience in adapting to the effects of climate change, and to guard against future pandemics while providing economic opportunities and greater equity over the long run.","Daniels, Thomas L.",Socio Ecol Pract Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8113791/,475

To counteract this lapse, the Orthopaedic Research Institute (ORI) designs an innovative training session. During the nationwide lockdown, the closure of the Institute allowed for the transfer of the VirtaMed ArthrosTM (VA), to our NHS facility. VA is a surgical simulator which enables the participant to practise knee arthroscopy. METHOD: Participants with little arthroscopic experience were included in the study. Three fellowship-trained surgeons conducted daily teaching sessions. Participants were taught necessary arthroscopic skills before undertaking training modules on diagnostic arthroscopy. 90% of the participants attended the session at least three times. At the end of every module, VA generates a score based on parameters which include procedure duration, visualisation of key structures and iatrogenic chondral damage. Structure questionnaires were also used to analyse feedback. RESULTS: The overall confidence and module scores progress with each subsequent session. A keystone of success is the location and ease of access to the simulator. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical simulators are a useful tool for surgical education and training. We should encourage their use in the future, especially in the UK surgical training programme.","Aung, M; Obakponovwe, O; Raymond, A; Apostolidis, K; Bahadori, S; Wainwright, T; Middleton, R",Br J Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8135789/,475

METHOD: A retrospective observational study comparing lead surgeons in Laparotomy and Appendectomies between 23rd March- 31st July (2019/2020). A subjective survey was done to elucidate perspectives on skill, academic advancement and trust/deanery support. A focussed group discussion was also done to gain insight on physical and psychological well-being. RESULTS: Laparotomy 2019 (n = 75) had 59%; 41%; 0% - Consultants/Registrars/ fellows respectively as lead surgeons. 2020 Laparotomies (n = 50) had 40% consultants; 41% registrars; 20% fellows Similarly, Appendectomy 2019 (n = 94) had 8.5% consultants; 71.3% registrars; 3.2% clinical fellows, whereas 2020 Appendectomies (n = 67) had 18% consultants; 71.6% registrars and 10.4% fellows.

However, 1 - 2 per million 15–19-year-old Caucasian patients will also develop nasal SCC. This case reports a rare finding of a 19-year-old Caucasian male with nasal SCC. METHOD: Medical records were used to access to all relevant clinical notes for the patient, including blood results, clinical documentation, imaging, and histology. The patient’s clinical journey was reviewed from initial referral to the ENT department to diagnosis with non-keratinising squamous cell carcinoma (NKSCC) stage IV b. Progression of disease: The patient was initially referred to ENT with unilateral tinnitus and temporal headache and diagnosed in clinic with glue ear and hypertrophic adenoidal tissue. He was due to have grommets and EUA, which was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and lack of clinical suspicion of SCC. Patient was later seen in ED for epistaxis, and then for neck swelling after which he was diagnosed with SCC. CONCLUSIONS: As the patient is a young, caucasian and a non-smoker, the initial diagnosis was lymphoma rather than SCC. This highlights the difficulties of diagnosing this type of cancer in young Caucasian patients.","Calmuc, A",Br J Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8135792/,475

DESIGN: Multinational network cohort study. SETTING: Electronic health records and health claims data from eight countries: Australia, France, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States, mapped to a common data model. PARTICIPANTS: 126 661 070 people observed for at least 365 days before 1 January 2017, 2018, or 2019 from 13 databases. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Events of interests were 15 prespecified AESIs (non-haemorrhagic and haemorrhagic stroke, acute myocardial infarction, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, anaphylaxis, Bell’s palsy, myocarditis or pericarditis, narcolepsy, appendicitis, immune thrombocytopenia, disseminated intravascular coagulation, encephalomyelitis (including acute disseminated encephalomyelitis), Guillain-Barré syndrome, and transverse myelitis). Incidence rates of AESIs were stratified by age, sex, and database. Rates were pooled across databases using random effects meta-analyses and classified according to the frequency categories of the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences. RESULTS: Background rates varied greatly between databases. Deep vein thrombosis ranged from 387 (95% confidence interval 370 to 404) per 100 000 person years in UK CPRD GOLD data to 1443 (1416 to 1470) per 100 000 person years in US IBM MarketScan Multi-State Medicaid data among women aged 65 to 74 years. Some AESIs increased with age. For example, myocardial infarction rates in men increased from 28 (27 to 29) per 100 000 person years among those aged 18-34 years to 1400 (1374 to 1427) per 100 000 person years in those older than 85 years in US Optum electronic health record data. Other AESIs were more common in young people. For example, rates of anaphylaxis among boys and men were 78 (75 to 80) per 100 000 person years in those aged 6-17 years and 8 (6 to 10) per 100 000 person years in those older than 85 years in Optum electronic health record data. Meta-analytic estimates of AESI rates were classified according to age and sex. CONCLUSION: This study found large variations in the observed rates of AESIs by age group and sex, showing the need for stratification or standardisation before using background rates for safety surveillance. Considerable population level heterogeneity in AESI rates was found between databases.","Li, Xintong; Ostropolets, Anna; Makadia, Rupa; Shoaibi, Azza; Rao, Gowtham; Sena, Anthony G; Martinez-Hernandez, Eugenia; Delmestri, Antonella; Verhamme, Katia; Rijnbeek, Peter R; Duarte-Salles, Talita; Suchard, Marc A; Ryan, Patrick B; Hripcsak, George; Prieto-Alhambra, Daniel",BMJ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8193077/,475

55231,Products,2021-07-01,"Pharmacists are increasingly becoming the health professionals that interact most regularly with patients who have diseases or disorders for which exercise is an effective and recommended treatment or therapy. Despite major curricular changes within pharmacy training programs in recent years to facilitate a more hands‐on role with patients, there has been negligible attention paid to training in exercise physiology and prescription. The goal was to therefore develop a course that would provide student pharmacists with the knowledge and skills to make evidence‐based exercise recommendations to their patients, with a specific focus on chronic diseases and conditions that are commonly seen in community pharmacies. The 2‐credit elective was designed to be taught by distance in order to accommodate students across two campuses and final year students undertaking clinical rotations across Washington. In hindsight, this decision was prescient given that its deployment was delayed until the fall of 2020 when all courses in Doctor of Pharmacy program at Washington State University were being delivered remotely due to the COVID‐19 pandemic. Fifteen self‐contained modules were developed and delivered using the Blackboard learning management system and released to students on a weekly basis. Each module contained 3‐5 learning objectives, an instructor‐prepared video of no more than 15 minutes in duration that introduced and described the relevant material and provided practical examples relative to pharmacy practice, and links to resources that provided additional information on the respective topic. Students were then required to complete a quiz containing five open‐book, multiple choice questions that directly addressed the stated learning objectives. Finally, 2‐3 case studies, questions, tasks or articles that directly related to the weekly topic were posted by the instructor to a shared discussion board and students were required to review and analyze the materials and then share their thoughts and findings with their peers. The instructor held two voluntary one‐hour Zoom meetings each week to allow students to discuss the module topic in a live online conversation with their peers and the instructor. N=33 students were registered in the course and all demonstrated attainment of knowledge and skills relevant to the defined learning outcomes and therefore received a passing grade. Formal feedback from the students was 100% positive in terms of the course structure, pace, assessment requirements and use of technology, in addition to the instructor's ability to stimulate interest, challenge students, respond to questions or problems, and integrate the course to the students’ pharmacy training. Future plans include examining whether the course increased the frequency and improved the effectiveness of evidence‐based exercise recommendations given by pharmacy graduates to their patients.","Marsh, Susan",FASEB J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8239673/,475
55916,Nach dem Schmerztag ist vor dem Schmerztag,2021-07-26,"INTRODUCTION: Health care providers in emergency medical centres often encounter infected sources during medical procedures; these sources can generate droplets. Wearing respirators could help to protect against infection risk. However, to the best of our knowledge, no previous study has reported the efficacy of N95 or higher respirators for health care providers in emergency medical centres. METHODS: A randomized, crossover study of 26 health care providers was conducted to examine the protective performance of respirators. Quantitative fit tests with three types of respirators (cup type, fold type without valve and fold type with valve) were performed using seven exercises. Primary outcomes were the fit factors. Secondary outcomes included the percentage of fit factors above 100 and respirator preference. RESULTS: After excluding one participant, data for 25 participants were analysed. The fit factors and the percentage of fit factors above 100 were higher when participants wore a fold-type respirator (200 fit factors [38.6–200], 100% [0–100]) relative to those for the cup-type respirator (114.0 fit factors [16.0–185.2], 60% [0–100]) and valve-type respirator (84.9 fit factors [14.2–170.8], 23.8 % [0–100]) in normal respiration. There was no clear preference regarding the type of respirator. CONCLUSION: The type of respirator could influence protective performance for health care providers. Health care providers in emergency medical centres should be aware of and wear the type of respirator that is well-fitted for them in advance.","Lee, Sanghyun; Kim, Hongjung; Lim, Taeho; Oh, Jaehoon; Kang, Hyunggoo; Ahn, Chiwon; Song, Yeongtak; Lee, Juncheol; Shin, Hyungoo",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8280538/,475

Considering the high incidence and severity at late stage, researchers have been focusing on the identification of specific biomarkers and potential drug targets for T2D at the genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic levels. Microbes participate in the pathogenesis of multiple metabolic diseases including diabetes. However, the related studies are still non-systematic and lack the functional exploration on identified microbes. To fill this gap between gut microbiome and diabetes study, we first introduced eggNOG database and KEGG ORTHOLOGY (KO) database for orthologous (protein/gene) annotation of microbiota. Two datasets with these annotations were employed, which were analyzed by multiple machine-learning models for identifying significant microbiota biomarkers of T2D. The powerful feature selection method, Max-Relevance and Min-Redundancy (mRMR), was first applied to the datasets, resulting in a feature list for each dataset. Then, the list was fed into the incremental feature selection (IFS), incorporating support vector machine (SVM) as the classification algorithm, to extract essential annotations and build efficient classifiers. This study not only revealed potential pathological factors for diabetes at the microbiome level but also provided us new candidates for drug development against diabetes.","Zhang, Yu-Hang; Guo, Wei; Zeng, Tao; Zhang, ShiQi; Chen, Lei; Gamarra, Margarita; Mansour, Romany F.; Escorcia-Gutierrez, José; Huang, Tao; Cai, Yu-Dong",Front Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8299781/,475

Artificial technologies with such capability are highly desirable for various fields. However, current techniques such as visual sensing and laser scanning suffer from numerous fundamental problems. Here, we develop a bioinspired concept of millimeter-wave (mmWave) full-field micromotion sensing, creating a unique mmWave Bat (“mmWBat”), which can map and quantify tiny motions spanning macroscopic to μm length scales of full-field targets simultaneously and accurately. In mmWBat, we show that the micromotions can be measured via the interferometric phase evolution tracking from range-angle joint dimension, integrating with full-field localization and tricky clutter elimination. With our approach, we demonstrate the capacity to solve challenges in three disparate applications: multiperson vital sign monitoring, full-field mechanical vibration measurement, and multiple sound source localization and reconstruction (radiofrequency microphone). Our work could potentially revolutionize full-field micromotion monitoring in a wide spectrum of applications, while may inspiring novel biomimetic wireless sensing systems.","Xiong, Yuyong; Li, Songxu; Gu, Changzhan; Meng, Guang; Peng, Zhike",Research (Wash D C),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8385533/,475

State-by-state variations to the COVID-19 pandemic illustrate the political dynamics of “kaleidoscopic federalism,” under which there is no single prevailing principle of federalism. In the COVID-19 pandemic, features of kaleidoscopic federalism combined with shortcomings in the public health system under the Trump administration, leading to fragmented responses to the pandemic among the states. Federalism alone does not explain the shortcomings of the United States’ response to the pandemic. Rather, the fragmented response was driven by state partisanship, which shaped state public health interventions and resulted in differences in public health outcomes. This has sobering implications for American federalism because state-level partisan differences yield different and unequal responses to the pandemic.","Birkland, Thomas A; Taylor, Kristin; Crow, Deserai A; DeLeo, Rob",Publius,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8385820/,475

The Plague of Provence (or “Great Plague of Marseille”) represents a major eighteenth-century disaster that left in its wake as many as 126,000 deaths. Over the last three hundred years, commemorative artworks have memorialized the disaster and helped define how it is remembered. To help mark the tricentennial, this essay will examine a series of images portraying different aspects of the Plague of Provence. In particular, it will analyze how these images depict what I argue are two central themes in the art of the Plague of Provence: Marseillais civic virtue and the medical profession. Doing so reveals how these subjects were valued or perceived in the first decades of the eighteenth century, and why this matters today as we confront new contagious diseases including COVID-19.","Ermus, Cindy",Environ Hist Durh N C,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8385968/,475

The preanesthesia clinic is the ideal setting for early evaluation of high-risk pregnant patients. Comorbidities may include cardiovascular pathology such as valvular abnormalities, septal defects, aortopathies, arrythmias and cardiomyopathies. Additional comorbidities include pulmonary conditions such as obstructive sleep apnea as well as preexisting neuromuscular and skeletal disorders that may impact anesthetic management. Hematologic conditions involving both bleeding diathesis and thrombophilias may present unique challenges for the anesthesiologist. Patients may also present with endocrinopathies including diabetes and obesity. While not as common, high-risk patients may also have preexisting gastrointestinal conditions such as liver dysfunction, renal failure, and even post-transplant status. Ongoing and prior substance abuse, obstetric conditions such as placenta accreta spectrum disorders, and fetal conditions needing ex utero Intrapartum treatment also require advanced planning. Preanesthesia evaluations also help address important ethical and cultural considerations. Counseling patients regarding anesthetic considerations as well as addressing concerns will play a role in reducing racial and ethnic disparities. Anticipatory guidance by means of pre-anesthetic planning can facilitate multidisciplinary communication and planning.

As the primary organ of thymopoiesis, the thymus performs a crucial role in generating a self-tolerant but diverse repertoire of T cell receptors and peripheral T cell pool, with the capacity to recognize a wide variety of antigens and for the surveillance of malignancies. However, cells in the thymus are fragile and sensitive to changes in the external environment and acute insults such as infections, chemo- and radiation-therapy, resulting in thymic injury and degeneration. Though the thymus has the capacity to self-regenerate, it is often insufficient to reconstitute an intact thymic function. Thymic dysfunction leads to an increased risk of opportunistic infections, tumor relapse, autoimmunity, and adverse clinical outcome. Thus, exploiting the mechanism of thymic regeneration would provide new therapeutic options for these settings.

58615,Complications after surgery for malignant melanoma do not delay further treatment,2021-10-05,"BACKGROUND: Scientific conferences which are considered as an important event for dissemination of research and related academic activities were badly affected during the COVID-19 pandemic. Virtual format for interaction was used as an alternative method to continue such academic discourse. However, this did not provide the same level of communication and interest as that of in-person meetings. With evolving knowledge about the COVID-19 pandemic especially its transmission, role of vaccine, and observing standard operating procedures (SOPs), fear among healthcare providers is mitigated to some extent. Keeping in mind the importance of scientific conferences in the context of sharing knowledge and its impact on the training of faculty members and postgraduate residents, a hybrid conference was planned by the national association of pediatric surgeons. The purpose of this study was to retrospectively review the challenges faced during the organization of this conference as well as to analyze the pattern of registration, number of abstracts received, the gender of the participants and their status, region of the country they represented, type of presentation made, and scientific subject covered. SPSS version 22 was used for data entry. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to present data. Chi square test was applied to find out the association between categorical variables and a p value < 0.05 was considered as significant. RESULTS: A total of 170 pediatric surgeons and postgraduate residents participated from all over the country and abroad. Nearly half (47.1%) of the registrants were postgraduate residents. Most of the participants (90%) opted for in-person attendance. The venue was selected with a capacity to house more than double the number of registrants with provision of safe distance. Availability of face masks, gloves, and sanitizers was ensured by the organizers. Packed meal boxes were arranged and served at the venue site in an open place on the terrace. A total of 97 abstracts were accepted for presentation that included 57 (58.8%) long oral podium and 40 (41.2%) poster presentations. Most of the studies (n=48–49.4%) were related to the subject of gastroenterology including pancreatico-hepatobiliary system and spleen. Majority of the presenters were male (p = 0.046) and postgraduate residents (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: It was possible to organize a hybrid annual medical conference where most of the participants preferred physical presence. A rich scientific program was made to cater the needs for pediatric surgical fraternity. Residents made attractive presentations. It was noted that physical presence during clinical conference produced effective communication and learning.","Patel, Muhammad Haris; Akhtar, Jamshed; Taqvi, Syed Muhammad Raees Hussain; Batool, Tayyaba",Ann Pediatr Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8493362/,475

A continuum mechanical description of the motion of this interface, or phase boundary, takes the form of a kinetic law which relates the thermodynamic driving force across it with its velocity in the reference configuration. For biological macromolecules immersed in a heat bath, thermally activated kinetics described by the Arrhenius law is often a good choice. Here we show that 'stick-slip' kinetics, characteristic of friction, can also arise in an overdamped bistable bar immersed in a heat bath. To mimic a rod-like biomolecule we model the bar as a chain of masses and bistable springs moving in a viscous fluid. We conduct Langevin dynamics calculations on the chain and extract a temperature dependent kinetic relation by observing that the dissipation at a phase boundary can be estimated by performing an energy balance. Using this kinetic relation we solve boundary value problems for a bistable bar immersed in a constant temperature bath and show that the resultant force-extension relation matches very well with the Langevin dynamics results. We estimate the force fluctuations at the pulled end of the bar due to thermal kicks from the bath by using a partition function. We also show rate dependence of hysteresis in cyclic loading of the bar arising from the stick-slip kinetics. Our kinetic relation could be applied to rod-like biomolecules, such as, DNA and coiled-coil proteins which exhibit structural transitions that depend on both temperature and loading rate.","Sun, Chuanpeng; Purohit, Prashant K",International journal of solids and structures,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijsolstr.2019.07.022; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32831392/,475

In this study we investigated the role of the UPS in different steps of the coronavirus (CoV) infection cycle. Inhibition of the proteasome by different chemical compounds (i.e., MG132, epoxomicin, and Velcade) appeared to not only impair entry but also RNA synthesis and subsequent protein expression of different CoVs (i.e., mouse hepatitis virus [MHV], feline infectious peritonitis virus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV). MHV assembly and release were, however, not appreciably affected by these compounds. The inhibitory effect on CoV protein expression did not appear to result from a general inhibition of translation due to induction of a cellular stress response by the inhibitors. Stress-induced phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2alpha (eIF2alpha) generally results in impaired initiation of protein synthesis, but the sensitivity of MHV infection to proteasome inhibitors was unchanged in cells lacking a phosphorylatable eIF2alpha. MHV infection was affected not only by inhibition of the proteasome but also by interfering with protein ubiquitination. Viral protein expression was reduced in cells expressing a temperature-sensitive ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1 at the restrictive temperature, as well as in cells in which ubiquitin was depleted by using small interfering RNAs. Under these conditions, the susceptibility of the cells to virus infection was, however, not affected, excluding an important role of ubiquitination in virus entry. Our observations reveal an important role of the UPS in multiple steps of the CoV infection cycle and identify the UPS as a potential drug target to modulate the impact of CoV infection.","Raaben, Matthijs; Posthuma, Clara C; Verheije, Monique H; te Lintelo, Eddie G; Kikkert, Marjolein; Drijfhout, Jan W; Snijder, Eric J; Rottier, Peter J M; de Haan, Cornelis A M",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00485-10; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20484504/,475

Two different portal techniques were used, namely MPAS (three separate ports) in lions and SPAS (SILS™ port) in cheetahs, using standard straight laparoscopic instruments. Portal access system and first ovary was not randomized. Five different surgery times were compared for the two different procedures as well as evaluating the use and application of MPAS and SPAS. Carbon dioxide volumes for lions were recorded. RESULTS In adult lionesses operative time (OPT) (P = 0.016) and total surgical time (TST) (P = 0.032) were significantly shorter for salpingectomy compared to ovariectomy. Similarly in cheetahs OPT (P = 0.001) and TST (P = 0.005) were also shorter for salpingectomy compared to ovariectomy. In contrast, in lion cubs no difference was found in surgery times for ovariectomy and salpingectomy. Total unilateral procedure time was shorter than the respective bilateral time for both procedures (P = 0.019 and P = 0.001) respectively and unilateral salpingectomy was also faster than unilateral ovariectomy (P = 0.035) in cheetahs. Port placement time, suturing time and TST were significantly shorter for SPAS compared to MPAS (P = 0.008). There was, however, no difference in OPT between SPAS and MPAS. Instrument cluttering with SPAS was found to be negligible. There was no difference in mean volume CO2 required to complete ovariectomy in lions but the correlation between bodyweight and total volume of CO2 in lions was significant (rs = 0.867; P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic salpingectomy was faster than ovariectomy in both adult lions and cheetahs. Using SPAS, both unilateral procedures were faster than bilateral procedures in cheetahs. Placement and suturing of SPAS in cheetahs was easier and faster compared to three separate ports in lions and lion cubs. The use of standard straight instruments during SPAS did not prolong surgery. Surgery was faster in cubs and CO2 required for laparoscopic sterilization in lions could be determined. Predictable surgery times and CO2 volumes will facilitate the accurate planning and execution of surgery in lions and cheetahs.","Hartman, Marthinus Jacobus; Monnet, Eric; Kirberger, Robert Murco; Schoeman, Johan Petrus",Acta veterinaria Scandinavica,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13028-016-0199-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26935755/,475
65859,Brazil threatens Indigenous lands.,2020-05-01,"OBJECTIVE/BACKGROUND The development of new tools capable of targeting Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)-infected cells have potential applications in diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of tuberculosis. In Mtb-infected cells, CD1b molecules present Mtb lipids to the immune system (Mtb lipid-CD1b complexes). Because of the lack of CD1b polymorphism, specific Mtb lipid-CD1b complexes could be considered as universal Mtb infection markers. 2-Stearoyl-3-hydroxyphthioceranoyl-2'-sulfate-α-α'-d-trehalose (Ac2SGL) is specific for Mtb, and is not present in other mycobacterial species. The CD1b-Ac2SGL complexes are expressed on the surface of human cells infected with Mtb. The aim of this study was to generate ligands capable of binding these CD1b-Ac2SGL complexes. METHODS A synthetic human scFv phage antibody library was used to select phage-displayed antibody fragments that recognized CD1b-Ac2SGL using CD1b-transfected THP-1 cells loaded with Ac2SGL. RESULTS One clone, D11-a single, light-variable domain (kappa) antibody (dAbκ11)-showed high relative binding to the Ac2SGL-CD1b complex. CONCLUSION A ligand recognizing the Ac2SGL-CD1b complex was obtained, which is a potential candidate to be further tested for diagnostic and therapeutic applications.","Camacho, Frank; Sarmiento, María E; Reyes, Fatima; Kim, Louise; Huggett, Jim; Lepore, Marco; Otero, Oscar; Gilleron, Martine; Puzo, Germain; Norazmi, Mohd Nor; Rook, Graham; Mori, Lucia; De Libero, Gennaro; Acosta, Armando",International journal of mycobacteriology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijmyco.2015.12.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27242221/,475

Accordingly, PWH are experiencing an increased burden of age-related comorbidities. With this shifting demographic, clinicians and researchers face additional challenges in how to identify, address, and manage the complex intersections of HIV- and aging-related conditions. Established in 2009, the International Workshop on HIV and Aging brings together clinicians and researchers in cross-disciplinary fields along with community advocates and PWH to address the multidisciplinary nature of HIV and aging. This article summarizes plenary talks from the 10th Annual International Workshop on HIV and Aging, which took place in New York City on October 10 and 11, 2019. Presentation topics included: the burdens of HIV-associated comorbidities, aging phenotypes, community engagement, and loneliness; these issues that are especially important for older PWH considering the current COVID-19 pandemic. We also discuss broad questions and potential directions for future research necessary to better understand the interaction between HIV and aging.","Shiau, Stephanie; Bender, Alexis A; O'Halloran, Jane A; Sundermann, Erin; Aggarwal, Juhi; Althoff, Keri N; Baker, Jason V; Deeks, Steven G; Fried, Linda P; Karpiak, Stephen; Karris, Maile; Marcotte, Thomas; Nachega, Jean B; Margolick, Joseph B; Erlandson, Kristine M; Moore, David J",AIDS research and human retroviruses,https://doi.org/10.1089/aid.2020.0128; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32847368/,475

The enhancement to whole-body explosive muscular performance (PE) after heavy-resistance exercise is often attributed to modulations in neuromuscular function that are proposed to reflect PAP, but the evidence to support this is equivocal. We assessed the neuromuscular basis of PE using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the primary motor cortex, and electrical stimulation of the femoral nerve. Eleven male athletes performed heavy-resistance exercise with measures of countermovement jump (CMJ) pre- and 8 min post-exercise. Pre-exercise and after the final CMJ, single- and paired-pulse TMS were delivered during submaximal isometric knee-extensor contractions to measure corticospinal excitability, short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI), and intracortical facilitation (ICF), with motor evoked potentials recorded from rectus femoris. Twitch responses to motor nerve stimulation during and post maximum-knee-extensor contractions were studied to quantify voluntary activation (VA) and potentiated twitch (Qtw,pot ). The experimental protocol successfully induced PE (+4 ± 1% change in CMJ, P = 0.01), but no changes were observed for maximum voluntary force, VA, corticospinal excitability, SICI or ICF (all P > 0.05), and Qtw,pot declined (P < 0.001). An enhancement of muscular performance after heavy-resistance exercise was not accompanied by PAP, or changes in measures of neuromuscular function.","Thomas, K; Toward, A; West, D J; Howatson, G; Goodall, S",Scandinavian journal of medicine & science in sports,https://doi.org/10.1111/sms.12626; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26639349/,475

Here, we report the case of a 27-year-old Japanese woman with a significant weight gain of 50 kg, who was referred to the Kumamoto University Hospital because of gait impairment and dyspnea. Imaging tests revealed an ovarian tumor, 37 cm in diameter, with two solid components. The patient's condition improved after the removal of 31.5 l tumor fluid by using a suprapubic urinary catheter for 3 days. The tumor was subsequently resected without complications, and was diagnosed as a left mucinous ovarian tumor with malignant components, weighing 37 kg (81.5 lb). The patient was discharged after her anasarca improved, and her body weight decreased from 100 to 50 kg with accompanying considerable urination within two weeks. She was in good condition with no evidence of recurrence at 15 months after surgery. Tumor resection after preoperative drainage was effective in the management of a patient with dyspnea induced by a giant ovarian tumor. We suggest the use of a suprapubic urinary catheter for preoperative drainage because of its ease of use in preventing fluid leakage from the possibly malignant tumor.","Yamaguchi, Munekage; Tashiro, Hironori; Takaishi, Kiyomi; Honda, Ritsuo; Katabuchi, Hidetaka",Gynecologic and obstetric investigation,https://doi.org/10.1159/000369389; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25661539/,475

In this paper, we report the first detection of AiV in Piedmont, Italy, in pediatric patients. METHODS A total of 159 fecal specimens (from 96 males and 63 females) previously screened for rotaviruses, adenoviruses, noroviruses, human parechoviruses, saliviruses, and sapoviruses were collected from infants and children with acute gastroenteritis. RESULTS The most commonly detected virus was norovirus GII (33.80%), fol lowed by rotavirus (21.30%), astrovirus (18.87%), boca virus (13.92%), sapovirus (10.90%), parechovirus (8%), norovirus GI (6.70%), adenovirus (1%), and salivirus (0.52%). Real-time polymerase chain reaction detected AiV A in 1 (0.62%) case subjects. AiV A was detected in monoinfection only in January.

METHOD AND MATERIALS Eighty participants were assigned to two groups, namely, those who drank red wine (experimental group), and those who did not drink red wine (control group). The experimental group participants rinsed their mouths with 25 mL of red wine four times a day during the bleaching period. Shade evaluation was assessed visually by using the Vita Classical and Vita Easyshade techniques. Tooth sensitivity was evaluated by the numeric and visual analog scales, and the salivary and gingival crevicular fluids were collected for assessment of nitric oxide (NO) levels, a marker of inflammation. Differences in color change were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). The absolute risks of tooth sensitivity were compared by the Fisher exact test. Tooth sensitivity intensity data sets for both the visual analog scale and the numeric rating scale were compared using the Wilcoxon signed rank test (α = .05). Repeated measures and two-way ANOVA followed by the Bonferroni test were used to assess time-course and differences between groups in NO production. RESULTS The bleaching technique was effective regardless of wine consumption (P > .05). Tooth sensitivity was classified as mild, with no differences between groups (P > .05). Red wine reduced both the gingival crevicular fluid and salivary levels of NO (P < .05). CONCLUSION Red wine does not interfere with the effectiveness and sensitivity of at-home teeth bleaching with 10% carbamide peroxide and protects against bleaching-induced inflammation.","Menezes, Lucas Lage; Lima, Suellen Nogueira Linares; Maia-Filho, Etevaldo Matos; Fernandes, Elizabeth Soares; Mendes, Saulo Jose Figueredo; Gonçalves, Leticia Machado; Bandeca, Matheus Coelho; Reis, Alessandra; Loguercio, Alessandro D; Tavarez, Rudys Rodolfo De Jesus",Quintessence international,https://doi.org/10.3290/j.qi.b1864313; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34369940/,475

This work introduces an innovative and cost-effective approach to detect and quantify plastic substances in teabags by applying near infrared hyperspectral imaging (951-2496 nm) coupled with multivariate analysis. Teabags from 6 popular brands were investigated and categorized into three classes based on spectral unmixing and target detection results: 1) the plastic teabag primarily made of nylon 6/6; 2) those made of a composite with various polypropylene and cellulose ratios; 3) biodegradable teabags free from any plastic traces. Results demonstrated the presence of numerous plastic particles in the beverage obtained after steeping nylon teabags, but the release of particles was further amplified after microwave treatment. Nevertheless, target detection results obtained from Fourier transform infrared imaging (4000-675 cm-1) dataset evidenced that a considerable proportion of particle residues detected were the contaminants obtained from tea granules that adsorbed on the teabag. This work highlights the significant importance of performing rigorous spectral analysis for chemical characterization, which is lacking in most published microplastic studies.","Xu, Jun-Li; Lin, Xiaohui; Hugelier, Siewert; Herrero-Langreo, Ana; Gowen, Aoife A",Journal of hazardous materials,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.126328; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34118538/,475
81122,Pandemic could mark 'turning point' for Chinese science.,2021-01-15,"BACKGROUND Fatigue and mental workload are directly associated with high-complexity tasks. In general, difficult tasks produce a higher mental workload, leaving little opportunity to deal with new/unexpected events and increasing the likelihood of performance errors. The laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) learning curve is considered to be one of the most difficult to complete in laparoscopic surgery. We wished to validate the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) in LRYGB and identify factors that could provoke a higher mental workload for surgeons during the learning curve. METHODS A single surgeon was enrolled to undertake 70 consecutive LRYGB procedures with two internal surgeons mentoring the first 35 cases. Patients were consecutive and ranked from case 35 to case 105 according to the date of the surgical procedure (""case rank""). Self-ratings of satisfaction, performance, and fatigue were measured at the end of surgery using a validated NASA-TLX questionnaire. The procedure was recorded for later viewing by two external evaluators. General data for patients and surgical variables were collected prospectively. RESULTS A moderate correlation between the NASA-TLX score, BMI, operative time, and volumes of blood drainage was observed. There was no correlation between the NASA-TLX score and duration of hospital stay or time of drain removal. BMI ≥50 kg/m(2), male sex, inexperienced first assistant, and type 2 diabetes mellitus were identified as independent predictive factors of a higher NASA-TLX score. CONCLUSIONS The NASA-TLX is a valid tool to gauge mental workload in LRYGB.","Ruiz-Rabelo, Juan Francisco; Navarro-Rodriguez, Elena; Di-Stasi, Leandro Luigi; Diaz-Jimenez, Nelida; Cabrera-Bermon, Juan; Diaz-Iglesias, Carlos; Gomez-Alvarez, Manuel; Briceño-Delgado, Javier",Obesity surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-015-1922-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26459432/,475

At present, the development of BC is accelerating and showing a younger trend, which may be due to the known and/or unknown risk factors (RFs) for BC are increasing. It has been reported that inflammatory factors promote the occurrence and development of BC. No doubt chronic inflammation could trigger a series of molecular events, which will lead to the malignant transformation of differentiated cells, inhibition of anti-tumor immunity, and finally, lead to the occurrence and metastasis of tumors. With the deepening of research, it has been found that pro-inflammatory cytokine-interleukin-17 (IL-17) is closely related to BC. It not only plays an important role in promoting tumor proliferation, invasion and metastasis, but also has a significant correlation with poor prognosis. Recently, it was reported that IL-17 is closely related to programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) in BC. Therefore, starting with the role of IL-17 family cytokines in BC, this paper briefly discusses the potential role and status of IL-17 and seeks to contribute to the development of targeted drugs for BC-related treatments and to the identification of prediction factors for the early detection and prognosis prediction of BC for laying a solid theoretical foundation.","Song, Xuelian; Wei, Changran; Li, Xiangqi",International immunopharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intimp.2021.107544; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33740640/,475

Two mental health measures (depression and anxiety) were regressed on social network variables relevant to the Covid-19 crisis (frequency of face-to-face contact and frequency of contact through electronic means), controlling for confounders. Interactions of age group and social networks were considered. Baseline mental health was controlled, focusing the analysis on post-outbreak mental health change. RESULTS Face-to-face network contact significantly reduced negative mental health changes while electronic contact significantly increased them. The age interactions were insignificant.

84889,Advances in Surgical Telemedicine During the Coronavirus Pandemic.,2020-06-12,"PURPOSE Inflammatory pathways are involved in the pathogenesis of pneumonia. Frequent sauna sessions may reduce the risk of respiratory tract infections including pneumonia independent of inflammation. We aimed to evaluate the independent and joint associations of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and frequency of sauna bathing (FSB) with risk of pneumonia in a prospective cohort study. METHODS Serum hsCRP as an inflammatory marker was measured using an immunometric assay and FSB was assessed by self-reported sauna bathing habits at baseline in 2264 men aged 42-61 yr. Serum hsCRP was categorized as normal and high (≤3 and >3 mg/L, respectively) and FSB as low and high (defined as ≤1 and 2-7 sessions/wk, respectively). Multivariable-adjusted HRs (CIs) were calculated for incident pneumonia. RESULTS A total of 528 cases of pneumonia occurred during a median follow-up of 26.6 yr. Comparing high versus normal hsCRP, the multivariable-adjusted risk for pneumonia was HR = 1.30 (95% CI, 1.04-1.62). The corresponding risk was HR = 0.79 (95% CI, 0.66-0.95) comparing high versus low FSB. Compared with men with normal hsCRP and low FSB, high hsCRP and low FSB was associated with an increased risk of pneumonia in multivariable analysis (HR = 1.67: 95% CI, 1.21-2.29), with no evidence of an association for high hsCRP and high FSB and pneumonia (HR = 0.94: 95% CI, 0.69-1.29).

Only 13.4%-28.6% of patients can be cured by traditional repeated endoscopic debridement. Here, we introduced an innovative curative-intent endoscopic surgery for PRNN patients and evaluated its clinical efficacy. METHODS Clinical data of 72 PRNN patients who underwent radical endoscopic necrectomy, followed by reconstruction using a posterior pedicle nasal septum and floor mucoperiosteum flap were analyzed to determine the efficacy of this surgery. The endpoints were complete re-epithelialization of the nasopharyngeal defect, relief of headache, and overall survival (OS). RESULTS All surgeries were successfully performed without any severe postoperative complications or death. The median value of numeric rating scales of pain decreased from 8 before surgery to 0 after surgery (P < 0.001). Fifty-one patients (70.8%) achieved complete re-epithelialization of the nasopharyngeal defect. The number of cycles of radiotherapy (odds ratio [OR], 7.254; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.035-50.821; P = 0.046), postoperative pathological result (OR, 34.087; 95% CI 3.168-366.746; P = 0.004), and survival status of flap (OR, 261.179; 95% CI 17.176-3971.599; P < 0.001) were independent risk factors of re-epithelialization of the nasopharyngeal defects. Postoperative pathological result (hazard ratio [HR], 5.018; 95% CI 1.970-12.782; P = 0.001) was an independent prognostic factor for OS. The 2-year OS rate of the entire cohort was 77.9%.

89499,News briefs.,2021-06-01,"The interferon-induced transmembrane (IFITM) family of proteins have recently been identified as important host effector molecules of the type I interferon response against viruses. IFITM1 has been identified as a potent antiviral effector against hepatitis C virus (HCV), whereas the related family members IFITM2 and IFITM3 have been described to have antiviral effects against a broad range of RNA viruses. Here, we demonstrate that IFITM2 and IFITM3 play an integral role in the interferon response against HCV and act at the level of late entry stages of HCV infection. We have established that in hepatocytes, IFITM2 and IFITM3 localize to the late and early endosomes, respectively, as well as the lysosome. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that S-palmitoylation of all three IFITM proteins is essential for anti-HCV activity, whereas the conserved tyrosine residue in the N-terminal domain of IFITM2 and IFITM3 plays a significant role in protein localization. However, this tyrosine was found to be dispensable for anti-HCV activity, with mutation of the tyrosine resulting in an IFITM1-like phenotype with the retention of anti-HCV activity and co-localization of IFITM2 and IFITM3 with CD81. In conclusion, we propose that the IFITM proteins act in a coordinated manner to restrict HCV infection by targeting the endocytosed HCV virion for lysosomal degradation and demonstrate that the actions of the IFITM proteins are indeed virus and cell-type specific.","Narayana, Sumudu K; Helbig, Karla J; McCartney, Erin M; Eyre, Nicholas S; Bull, Rowena A; Eltahla, Auda; Lloyd, Andrew R; Beard, Michael R",The Journal of biological chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.m115.657346; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26354436/,475
89692,Effects of liposomal-curcumin on five opportunistic bacterial strains found in the equine hindgut - preliminary study.,2017,"BACKGROUND Over the last 20 years MIS has progressively gained popularity in children with cancer. We therefore aimed at evaluating the safety of Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS) resection in a series of children affected by adrenal neuroblastoma (NB) presenting without Image-Defined Risk Factors (IDRFs). METHODS An Institutional protocol for MIS resection of adrenal NB in pediatric patients without IDRFs has been applied since 2008. Absence of IDRFs represented the main indication for MIS in NB, regardless of tumor size. All pediatric patients who underwent MIS for NB between January 2008 and May 2013 were included. Specific technical considerations, demographic data, and outcome have been recorded. RESULTS Twenty-one patients underwent MIS resection for IDRFs-negative adrenal NB. Nine of these patients experienced preoperative downgrading of IDRFs after chemotherapy. Radiological median diameter of the mass was 30 mm (range 10-83 mm). Median operative time was 90 min. Median hospital stay was 4 days. All patients were treated successfully, without serious intraoperative complications. One mild intraoperative hemorrhage occurred and was treated without the need for conversion to open surgery nor blood transfusion was required. No postoperative complications, including port-site or peritoneal metastases were experienced. CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrated the safety and effectiveness of MIS for the resection of adrenal NB without IDRFs in children. Pediatric surgeons dedicated to oncology should be aware of this alternative approach to open resection.","Mattioli, Girolamo; Avanzini, Stefano; Pini Prato, Alessio; Pio, Luca; Granata, Claudio; Garaventa, Alberto; Conte, Massimo; Manzitti, Carla; Montobbio, Giovanni; Buffa, Piero",Pediatric surgery international,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00383-014-3476-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24477777/,475

90336,"Quiet Anthropocene, quiet Earth.",2020-09-11,"BACKGROUND The longitudinal study, ""Couples Lived Experiences,"" focuses on whether and how relationship characteristics of older couples change with the cognitive decline of one member of the couple, and how these changes affect each individual's emotional and physical health outcomes. Until now, most psychosocial research in dementia has focused either on the person with dementia (PWD) or the caregiver separately. The previous literature examining relationship characteristics and their role in outcomes for the caregiver and PWD is scant and suffers from methodological issues that limit the understanding of which relationship characteristics most influence outcomes for caregivers and care-receivers and what other factors may mitigate or exacerbate their effects. METHODS We will enroll 300 dyads and collect information via online interviews of each member of the couple, every 6 months for 3 years. Relationship characteristics will be measured with a set of short, well-validated, and reliable self-report measures, plus the newly developed ""Partnership Approach Questionnaire."" Outcomes include global quality of life, subjective physical health, mental health (depression and anxiety), and status change (transitions in levels of care; i.e., placement in a nursing home). Longitudinal data will be used to investigate how relationship characteristics are affected by cognitive, functional, and behavioral changes, and the impact of these changes on health outcomes. Qualitative data will also be collected to enrich the interpretation of results of quantitative analyses. DISCUSSION Psychosocial interventions have demonstrated effectiveness in promoting the wellbeing of PWD and their caregivers. The knowledge gained from this study can lead to the development or enhancement of targeted interventions for older couples that consider the impact of cognitive and functional decline on the relationship between members of a couple and thereby improve their wellbeing.

In this review, the literature was searched to make an overview of what is known on the expression of the proline-specific peptidases dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP) 4, 8, 9, prolyl oligopeptidase (PREP) and fibroblast activation protein α (FAP) in the healthy and diseased lung. Search terms included asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lung cancer, fibrosis, ischemia reperfusion injury and pneumonia. Knowledge on the loss or gain of protein expression and activity during disease might tie these enzymes to certain cell types, substrates or interaction partners that are involved in the pathophysiology of the disease, ultimately leading to the elucidation of their functional roles and a potential therapeutic target. Most data could be found on DPP4, while the other enzymes are less explored. Published data however often appear to be conflicting, the applied methods divers and the specificity of the assays used questionable. In conclusion, information on the expression of the proline-specific peptidases in the healthy and diseased lung is lacking, begging for further well-designed research.","Vliegen, Gwendolyn; Raju, Tom K; Adriaensen, Dirk; Lambeir, Anne-Marie; De Meester, Ingrid",Annals of translational medicine,https://doi.org/10.21037/atm.2017.03.36; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28462210/,475
91417,Tuning of Muscle Synergies During Walking Along Rectilinear and Curvilinear Trajectories in Humans.,2017,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE Single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) is a new advance wherein laparoscopic surgery is carried out through a single small incision hidden in the umbilicus. Advantages of this technique over standard laparoscopy are still under investigation. The objective of this study is to describe the short-term outcomes of SILS cholecystectomy in a single community-based institution. METHODS A retrospective review of a prospectively collected database for all patients who underwent SILS cholecystectomy was carried out. Both true single-incision and dual-incision (training) cases were included in the analysis. Operative and perioperative outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS Eighty SILS cholecystectomies (4 dual incision and 76 single incision) were performed from May 30, 2008 to April 23, 2009 (indications: 48 stones, 20 cholecystitis, 11 biliary dyskinesia, and 1 polyp). Mean body mass index (BMI) was 26.5 kg/m(2) (range 17.3-39.1 kg/m(2)), mean operating room (OR) time was 69.5 min (range 29-126 min), mean estimated blood loss (EBL) was 5 cc, and mean incision length was 1.6 cm. There were no open conversions, but there were six conversions to dual-port and three conversions to four-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy due to poor visualization. Complications include three bile leaks managed with endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and percutaneous drainage (3.7%). Two leaks were from accessory ducts and one was from a cystic duct stump. Number of days of postoperative oral narcotic use was described as none in 11 patients (23%), minimal (1 day) in 21 patients (45%), moderate (1-3 days) in 6 patients (13%), and heavy (≥ 4 days) in 9 patients (19%), with mean follow-up of 4.7 months in 60 patients. CONCLUSION SILS cholecystectomy is feasible, with acceptable morbidity. Although not directly compared in this study, postoperative recovery appears shorter than after standard laparoscopy, but more studies are needed.","Edwards, Chris; Bradshaw, Alan; Ahearne, Paul; Dematos, Pierre; Humble, Ted; Johnson, Randy; Mauterer, David; Soosaar, Peeter",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-010-0943-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20198490/,475

The global spread of Bd has led to mass mortality events in many amphibian species, resulting in at least 90 species' extinctions to date. Exposure to Bd metabolites (i.e. non-infectious antigenic chemicals released by Bd) partially protects frogs during subsequent challenges with live Bd, suggesting its use as a prophylactic treatment and potential vaccine. However, we do not know whether Bd metabolite exposure protects against strains beyond the one used for treatment. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a 3 × 2 experiment where we exposed adult Cuban treefrogs, Osteopilus septentrionalis, to one of three treatments (Bd metabolites from California-isolated strain JEL-270, Panamá-isolated strain JEL-419, or an artificial spring water control) and then challenged individuals with live Bd from either strain. We found that exposure to Bd metabolites from the California-isolated strain significantly reduced Bd loads of frogs challenged with the live Panamá-isolated strain, but no other treatments were found to confer protective effects. These findings demonstrate asymmetric cross-protection of a Bd metabolite prophylaxis and suggest that work investigating multiple, diverse strains is urgently needed.","Barnett, K M; Detmering, S E; McMahon, T A; Civitello, D J",Biology letters,https://doi.org/10.1098/rsbl.2021.0207; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34428958/,475

Objectives This study sought to describe antibiotic prescribing practices in three neonatology units in Kigali, Rwanda. Methods A multi-center, cross-sectional study conducted in two tertiary and one urban district hospital in Kigali, Rwanda. Participants were neonates admitted in neonatology who received a course of antibiotics during their admission. Data collected included risk factors for neonatal sepsis, clinical signs, symptoms, investigations for neonatal sepsis, antibiotics prescribed, and the number of deaths in the included cohort. Results 126 neonates were enrolled with 42 from each site. Prematurity (38%) followed by membrane rupture more than 18 hours (25%) were the main risk factors for neonatal sepsis. Ampicillin and Gentamicin (85%) were the most commonly used first-line antibiotics for suspected neonatal sepsis. Most neonates (87%) did not receive a second-line antibiotic. Cefotaxime (11%), was the most commonly used second-line antibiotic. The median duration of antibiotic use was four days in all surviving neonates (m=113). In neonates with negative blood culture and normal C-reactive protein (CRP), the median duration of antibiotics was 3.5 days; and for neonates, with positive blood cultures, the median duration was 11 days. Thirteen infants died (10%) at all three sites, with no significant difference between the sites. Conclusion The median antibiotic duration for neonates with normal lab results exceeded the recommended duration mandated by the national neonatal protocol. We recommend the development of antibiotic stewardship programs in neonatal units in Rwanda to prevent the adverse effects which may be caused by inappropriate or excessive use of antibiotics.","Cartledge, Peter Thomas; Ruzibuka, Fidel Shofel; Rutagarama, Florent; Rutare, Samuel; Rogo, Tanya",African health sciences,https://doi.org/10.4314/ahs.v20i4.17; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34394225/,475

However, users may not be aware of existing guidelines and lack expert design knowledge when composing such multi-view visualizations. In this paper, we present semantic snapping, an approach to help non-expert users design effective multi-view visualizations from sets of pre-existing views. When a particular view is placed on a canvas, it is ""aligned"" with the remaining views-not with respect to its geometric layout, but based on aspects of the visual encoding itself, such as how data dimensions are mapped to channels. Our method uses an on-the-fly procedure to detect and suggest resolutions for conflicting, misleading, or ambiguous designs, as well as to provide suggestions for alternative presentations. With this approach, users can be guided to avoid common pitfalls encountered when composing visualizations.

Methods A meta-analysis of studies that assessed AT outcomes was conducted through December 2018. Primary outcomes were changes in comorbidities at 1 year following AT. Secondary outcomes were the amount of weight loss at up to 4 years and pooled serious adverse events (SAEs). Results Five studies with 590 patients were included. At 1 year, there were improvements in metabolic conditions: mean difference (MD) in systolic blood pressure: -7.8 (-10.7 - -4.9) mm Hg; MD in diastolic blood pressure: -5.1 (-7.0 - 3.2) mm Hg; MD in triglycerides: -15.8 (-24.0 - -7.6) mg/dL; MD in high-density lipoprotein: 3.6 (0.7-6.6) mg/dL; MD in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c): -1.3 (-1.8 - -0.8) %; MD in aspartate transaminase: -2.7 (-4.1 - -1.3) U/L; MD in alanine transaminase: -7.5 (-9.8 - -5.2) U/L. At 1 (n=218), 2 (n=125), 3 (n=46), and 4 (n=27) years, the patients experienced 17.8%, 18.3%, 19.1%, and 18.6% total weight loss (TWL), corresponding to 46.3%, 46.2%, 48.0%, and 48.7% excess weight loss (EWL) (p<0.0001 for all). Subgroup analysis of 2 randomized controlled trials (n=225) showed that AT patients lost more weight than did controls by 11.6 (6.5-16.7) %TWL and 25.6 (16.0-35.3) %EWL and experienced greater improvement in HbA1c and alanine transaminase by 1.3 (0.8-1.8) % and 9.0 (3.9-14.0) U/L.

We sought to investigate body surface temperatures in feedlot wethers supplemented with ractopamine or zilpaterol and exposed to heat stress for 18 d. Corneal and skin temperatures were assessed via infrared thermography at 1 and 2-m distances. Rectal temperatures and circulating leukocytes, metabolites, and electrolytes were also measured. Heat stress increased (P < 0.05) rectal temperatures in unsupplemented and zilpaterol-supplemented lambs but not in ractopamine-supplemented lambs. Heat stress also increased (P < 0.05) surface temperatures of the cornea, nose, ear, and back, regardless of supplement. Observations were comparable between thermography performed at 1 and 2 m, and higher emissivity settings generally produced less variation. Heat stress tended to increase (P = 0.08) blood monocytes in unsupplemented but not ractopamine or zilpaterol-supplemented lambs. Granulocytes were increased (P < 0.05) by heat stress in ractopamine-supplemented lambs but decreased (P < 0.05) in zilpaterol-supplemented lambs. Blood glucose, triglycerides, and cholesterol did not differ among groups, and blood lactate was reduced (P < 0.05) by heat stress in zilpaterol-supplemented lambs only. Blood Na + was reduced (P < 0.05) and Ca 2+ increased (P < 0.05) by heat stress, regardless of supplement. These findings indicate that β1 and β2 adrenergic agonists differentially relieve some but not all heat stress-induced changes in stress indicators.

98748,Image guidance in orthopaedics and traumatology: A historical perspective.,2016,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW Chronic breathlessness is common in patients with advanced illness who require palliative care. Achieving good symptom control can be challenging. More people with advanced illness live in low and middle income than in high-income countries, but they are much less likely to receive palliative care. Most of the emerging evidence for the palliative management of chronic breathlessness is from high-income countries. This review explores the context of chronic breathlessness in low-income settings, how evidence for control of chronic breathlessness might relate to these settings and where further work should be focused. RECENT FINDINGS Systems for control of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) in these low-income contexts are poorly developed and health services are often overwhelmed with high levels both of NCD and communicable disease. Multidisciplinary and holistic approaches to disease management are often lacking in these settings. Developing an integrated primary care approach to NCD management is increasingly recognized as a key strategy and this should include palliative care. Most evidence-based approaches to the control of chronic breathlessness could be adapted for use in these contexts SUMMARY: Hand held fans, breathing techniques, graded exercise and use of low-dose morphine can all be used in low-income settings particularly in the context of holistic care. Research is needed into the most effective ways of implementing such interventions and palliative care needs to be promoted as a fundamental aspect of NCD management.","Leng, Mhoira E F; Daniel, Sunitha; Munday, Daniel",Current opinion in supportive and palliative care,https://doi.org/10.1097/spc.0000000000000287; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28682818/,475

We here describe our preliminary clinical experience with COVID-19 patients treated via an early initiation of extracorporeal blood purification combined with systemic heparinisation and respiratory support. METHODS Fifteen patients were included; several biomarkers associated with COVID-19 severity were monitored. Personalised treatment was tailored according to the levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL- 8, tumour necrosis factor alpha, C-reactive protein (CRP), neutrophilto- lymphocyte ratio, thrombocyte counts, D-dimers, and fibrinogen. Treatment consisted of respiratory support, extracorporeal blood purification using the AN69ST (oXiris®) hemofilter, and 300 U/kg heparin to maintain activation clotting time ≥ 180 seconds. RESULTS Ten patients presented with severe to critical disease (dyspnoea, hypoxia, respiratory rate > 30/min, peripheral oxygen saturation < 90%, or > 50% lung involvement on X-ray imaging). The median intensive care unit length of stay was 9.3 days (interquartile range 5.3-10.1); two patients developed ARDS and died after 5 and 26 days. Clinical improvement was associated with normalisation (increase) of thrombocytes and white blood cells, stable levels of IL-6 (< 50 ng/mL), and a decrease of CRP and fibrinogen. CONCLUSION Continuous monitoring of COVID-19 severity biomarkers and radiological imaging is crucial to assess disease progression, uncontrolled inflammation, and to avert irreversible multiorgan failure. The combination of systemic heparin anticoagulation regimens and extracorporeal blood purification using cytokine-adsorbing hemofilters may reduce hyperinflammation, prevent coagulopathy, and support clinical recovery.","Ugurov, Petar; Popevski, Dijana; Gramosli, Tanja; Neziri, Dashurie; Vuckova, Dragica; Gjorgon, Marko; Stoicovski, Emil; Marinkovic, Sanja; Veljanovska-Kiridjievska, Lidija; Ignevska, Katerina; Mehandziska, Sanja; Ambarkova, Elena; Mitrev, Zan; Rosalia, Rodney Alexander",Brazilian journal of cardiovascular surgery,https://doi.org/10.21470/1678-9741-2020-0403; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33113325/,475

Data from 1766 OTRs were analysed: 1024 (58%) white, 376 (21%) black, 261 (15%) Asian, 57 (3%) Middle Eastern/Mediterranean (ME/M), 48 (2.7%) Hispanic; and 1128 (64%) male. Viral infections affected 45.1% of OTRs, and were more common in white and ME/M patients (p<0.001). Fungal infections affected 28.1% and were more common in ME/M patients (p<0.001). Inflammatory skin disease affected 24.5%, and was most common in black patients (p<0.001). 26.4% of patients developed skin cancer. There was an increased risk of skin cancer in white vs non-white OTRs (HR4.4, 95% CI 3.5-5.7, p <0.001): keratinocyte cancers were more common in white OTRs (p<0.001) and Kaposi sarcoma was more common in black OTRs (p<0.001). These data support the need for programs that promote targeted dermatology surveillance for all OTRs, regardless of race, ethnicity or country of origin.","Kentley, Jonathan; Allawh, Rina; Rao, Swati; Doyle, Alden; Ahmad, Amar; Nadhan, Kumar; Lee Chung, Christina; Harwood, Catherine A",American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.1111/ajt.16210; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32659869/,475

Land-based expansion is possible but may exacerbate climate change and biodiversity loss, and compromise the delivery of other ecosystem services2-6. As food from the sea represents only 17% of the current production of edible meat, we ask how much food we can expect the ocean to sustainably produce by 2050. Here we examine the main food-producing sectors in the ocean-wild fisheries, finfish mariculture and bivalve mariculture-to estimate 'sustainable supply curves' that account for ecological, economic, regulatory and technological constraints. We overlay these supply curves with demand scenarios to estimate future seafood production. We find that under our estimated demand shifts and supply scenarios (which account for policy reform and technology improvements), edible food from the sea could increase by 21-44 million tonnes by 2050, a 36-74% increase compared to current yields. This represents 12-25% of the estimated increase in all meat needed to feed 9.8 billion people by 2050. Increases in all three sectors are likely, but are most pronounced for mariculture. Whether these production potentials are realized sustainably will depend on factors such as policy reforms, technological innovation and the extent of future shifts in demand.","Costello, Christopher; Cao, Ling; Gelcich, Stefan; Cisneros-Mata, Miguel Á; Free, Christopher M; Froehlich, Halley E; Golden, Christopher D; Ishimura, Gakushi; Maier, Jason; Macadam-Somer, Ilan; Mangin, Tracey; Melnychuk, Michael C; Miyahara, Masanori; de Moor, Carryn L; Naylor, Rosamond; Nøstbakken, Linda; Ojea, Elena; O'Reilly, Erin; Parma, Ana M; Plantinga, Andrew J; Thilsted, Shakuntala H; Lubchenco, Jane",Nature,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2616-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32814903/,475

These fungal cupping erosions emit a characteristic fluorescent orange-yellow color when the wing membrane is transilluminated with 385 nm UV light. The purpose of this study was to create and validate the R package, countcolors, for quantifying the distinct orange-yellow ultraviolet (UV) fluorescence in bat-wing membrane lesions caused by P. destructans. Validation of countcolors was completed by first quantifying the percent area of 20, 2.5 cm2 images. These generated images were of two known pixel colors ranging from 0% to 100% of the pixels. The countcolors package accurately measured the known proportion of a given color in each image. Next, 40, 2.5 cm2 sections of UV transilluminated photographs of little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus) wings were given to a single evaluator. The area of fluorescence was both manually measured and calculated using image analysis software and quantified with countcolors. There was good agreement between the two methods (Pearson's correlation=0.915); however, the manual use of imaging software showed a consistent negative bias. Reproducibility of the analysis methods was tested by providing the same images to naive evaluators who previously never used the software; no significant difference (P=0.099) was found among evaluators. Using the R package countcolors takes less time than does manually measuring the fluorescence in image analysis software, and our results showed that countcolors can improve the accuracy when quantifying the area of P. destructans infection in bat wing-membranes.","Hooper, Sarah E; Weller, Hannah; Amelon, Sybill K",Journal of wildlife diseases,https://doi.org/10.7589/2019-09-231; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32609601/,475

The aim of the current study was to analyze the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on older adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI)/dementia and their caregivers as well. Two hundred and four caregivers took part in the study, completing a self-reported questionnaire about the person with MCI/dementia and their own, since the lockdown period which started in February and ended in May of 2020 in Greece. Results indicated a significant overall decline of the people with MCI/dementia. Further, the domains in which people with MCI/dementia were mostly affected were: communication, mood, movement, and compliance with the new measures. Caregivers also reported a great increase in their psychological and physical burden during this period, where the available support sources were limited. The pandemic threatens to disrupt the basic routines that promote mental and physical health of both people with MCI/dementia and their caregivers.

102346,Transfer learning enhanced generative adversarial networks for multi-channel MRI reconstruction.,2021-05-26,"The growing use of therapeutic proteins requires accurate measurement techniques for measuring biophysical and structural changes during manufacturing. This is particularly true for PEGylation of proteins, because characterization of PEGylation reactions and products can often be difficult because of the relatively small impact on protein structure, the lack of an accessible PEG chromophore, and the heterogeneous final product mixtures. Intrinsic fluorescence spectroscopy is one potential solution because of its relatively high sensitivity to small changes in protein structure and its suitability for online or at-line measurements. Here we use PEGylation of lysosome as a model system to determine the efficacy of polarized Excitation Emission Matrix (pEEM) spectroscopy as a rapid tool for characterizing the structural variability of the lysozyme starting materials and PEGylated products with PEG to protein ratio (PPR). Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) showed that as PPR increased from 0 to 2.8, the hydrodynamic radius increased from ~2.2 to 4.8 nm. pEEM measurements provided several sources of information: Rayleigh scatter identified size changes and aggregate/particle formation, and fluorescence emission to assessed chemical and structural change. PEGylation induced sufficient physicochemical changes in lysozyme which produced changes in the pEEM spectra largely due to changes in hydrophobic environment for tryptophan residues close to a PEG attachment site. These significant spectral changes when modelled using conventional multivariate analysis methods were able to easily discriminate the raw product solutions according to degree of PEGylation and were also able to predict PPR with reasonable accuracy (RMSEC ~10%, REP<20%) considering the reference Size Exclusion Chromatography method error of ~7.2%. Variable selection of the pEEM data, suggest that equivalent predictions could be made with faster and simpler 2D spectra making the method a more viable online measurement method.

However, training focused on only one profession ignores the value realized through collaborations among multiple professions for solving health-related problems. This is at the core of inter-professional education (IPE). Effective IPE programs can result in inter-professional collaboration and translation science endeavors across the health sciences and beyond. Recent events such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the opioid crisis highlight the importance of veterinary medicine in advancing One Health through IPE. The prevalence of IPE programs in veterinary curricula, and the process by which these have been established, has not been widely described in the literature. Through an 18-question survey sent to associate deans (ADs) of 50 veterinary schools, we sought to determine the status of IPE in the veterinary curriculum. Thirty-nine schools agreed to participate, representing primarily United States (US) DVM public and private programs with some representation from Canadian, United Kingdom (UK), and Australasian programs. Schools that provide IPE courses developed their programs in collaboration with other health sciences programs across the 4-year curriculum. The perceived barriers for IPE offerings were no different between schools with or without opportunities; however, a lack of faculty and student-perceived value and lack of adequate space in the academic schedule were common threads. Our findings provide a snapshot of the current state of IPE in veterinary medical curricula, with a particular emphasis on the United States, and point to areas of programmatic need for the field.","Estrada, Amara H; Samper, Juan; Stefanou, Candice; Blue, Amy",Journal of veterinary medical education,https://doi.org/10.3138/jvme-2020-0066; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33661086/,475

Unfavorable decisions maintain many symptoms of borderline personality disorder (BPD); therefore, a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying decision-making in BPD is needed. In this review, the current literature comparing decision-making in patients with BPD versus healthy controls is analyzed. Twenty-eight empirical studies were identified through a structured literature search. The effect sizes from studies applying comparable experimental tasks were analyzed. It was found that (1) BPD patients discounted delayed rewards more strongly; (2) reversal learning was not significantly altered in BPD; and (3) BPD patients achieved lower net gains in the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT). Current psychotropic medication, sex and differences in age between the patient and control group moderated the IGT outcome. Altered decision-making in a variety of other tasks was supported by a qualitative review. In summary, current evidence supports the altered valuation of outcomes in BPD. A multifaceted influence on decision-making and adaptive learning is reflected in this literature.","Paret, Christian; Jennen-Steinmetz, Christine; Schmahl, Christian",Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2016.11.019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27914943/,475

MATERIALS AND METHODS The Pipeline was implanted in a total of 45 patients (mean age, 58 years; M:F=10:35) with 47 large/giant or fusiform aneurysms. We retrospectively evaluated the characteristics of the treated aneurysms, the periprocedural events, morbidity and mortality, and the early outcomes after Pipeline implantation. RESULTS The aneurysms were located in the internal carotid artery (ICA) cavernous segment (n=25), ICA intradural segment (n=11), vertebrobasilar trunk (n=8), and middle cerebral artery (n=3). Procedure-related events occurred in 18 cases, consisting of incomplete expansion (n=8), shortening-migration (n=5), transient occlusion of a jailed branch (n=3), and in-stent thrombosis (n=2). Treatment-related morbidity occurred in two patients, but without mortality. Both patients had modified Rankin scale (mRS) scores of 2, but had an improved mRS score of 0 at 1-month follow-up. Of the 19 patients presenting with mass effect, 16 improved but three showed no changes in their presenting symptoms. All patients had excellent outcomes (mRS, 0 or 1) during the follow-up period (median, 6 months; range, 2-30 months). Vascular imaging follow-up (n=31, 65.9%; median, 3 months, range, 1-25 months) showed complete or near occlusion of the aneurysm in 24 patients (77.4%) and decreased sac size in seven patients (22.6%). CONCLUSION In this initial multicenter study in Korea, the Pipeline seemed to be safe and effective for large/giant or fusiform aneurysms.

Consequently, training approaches are shifting towards competency based medical education, which incorporates robust assessment methods and credible standards of physician proficiency. However, current gastroenterology and hepatology training in the US continues to utilize procedural volume and global impressions without standardized criteria as markers of competence. In particular, efforts to optimize competency based training in gastrointestinal (GI) motility are not underway, even though GI motility disorders account for nearly half of outpatient gastroenterology visits. These deficiencies compromise the quality of patient care. Thus, there is a great need and opportunity to shift our focus in GI motility training towards a competency based approach. First, we need to clarify the variable rates of learning for individual diagnostic tests. We must develop integrated systems that standardize training and monitor physician competency for GI motility diagnostics. Finally, as a profession and society, we must create certification processes to credential competent physicians. These advances are critical to optimizing the quality of GI motility diagnostics in practice.","Yadlapati, R; Keswani, R N; Pandolfino, J E",Neurogastroenterology and motility : the official journal of the European Gastrointestinal Motility Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/nmo.12835; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27061311/,475

Decellularized bone matrix (Tutobone) seeded with bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells was used directly orthotopically or combined with a vessel and inserted immediately (1-step) or only after six weeks of subcutaneous ""incubation"" (2-step). After 12 weeks, histological and radiological assessment was performed. Variable callus formation was observed. No bone formation or remodeling of the graft through TRAP positive osteoclasts could be detected. Instead, a variable amount of necrotic tissue formed. Although necrotic area correlated significantly with amount of vessels and the 2-step strategy had significantly more vessels than the 1-step strategy, no significant reduction of necrotic area was found.

Currently, it is not possible to perform these interventions without the help of abdominal wall entryways, so these procedures are hybrids fusing minilaparoscopy and transluminal endoscopic surgery. This report presents a prospective clinical series of 25 patients who underwent transvaginal hybrid cholecystectomy for cholelithiasis. METHODS The study comprised a clinical series of 25 consecutive nonrandomized women who underwent a fusion transvaginal NOTES and minilaparoscopy procedure with two trocars for cholelithiasis: one 5-mm umbilical trocar and one 3-mm trocar in the upper left quadrant. The study had no control group. RESULTS The scheduled surgical intervention was performed for all 25 women. No intraoperative complications occurred. One patient had mild hematuria that resolved in less than 12 h, but no other complications occurred during an average follow-up period of 140 days. Of the 25 women, 20 were discharged in 24 h, and 5 were discharged less than 12 h after the procedure. CONCLUSION Hybrid transvaginal cholecystectomy, combining NOTES and minilaparoscopy, is a good surgical model for minimally invasive surgery. It can be performed in surgical settings where laparoscopy is practiced regularly using the instruments normally used for endoscopy and laparoscopic surgery. Due to the reproducibility of the intervention and the ease of vaginal closure, hybrid transvaginal cholecystectomy will permit further development of NOTES in the future.","Cuadrado-Garcia, Angel; Noguera, Jose F; Olea-Martinez, Jose M; Morales, Rafael; Dolz, Carlos; Lozano, Luis; Vicens, Jose-Carlos; Pujol, Juan José",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-010-1121-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20535500/,475

However, it remains largely unknown about whether dMyc can be involved in Drosophila innate immune response. Here, we have identified dMyc to be a negative regulator of Drosophila Imd pathway via the loss- and gain-of-function screening. We demonstrate that dMyc inhibits Drosophila Imd immune response via directly activating miR-277 transcription, which further inhibit the expression of imd and Tab2-Ra/b. Importantly, dMyc can improve the survival of flies upon infection, suggesting inhibiting Drosophila Imd pathway by dMyc is vital to restore immune homeostasis that is essential for survival. Taken together, our study not only reports a new dMyc-miR-277-imd/Tab2 axis involved in the negative regulation of Drosophila Imd pathway, and provides a new insight into the complex regulatory mechanism of Drosophila innate immune homeostasis maintenance.","Li, Ruimin; Zhou, Hongjian; Jia, Chaolong; Jin, Ping; Ma, Fei",PLoS genetics,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1008989; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32810129/,475

Sildenafil citrate (SC) exhibited a well-documented success for treatment of several types of erectile dysfunction. However, its oral use is limited by serious adverse effects, poor bioavailability, delayed onset, and drug-drug interactions. This work is the first to design and assess sildenafil-loaded bilosomes for topical local treatment of erectile dysfunction. Different sildenafil-loaded bilosomes were prepared and characterized. Permeability of selected formulations was conducted through full-thickness human skin. Optimized bilosomes integrating sodium tauroglycocholate (STGC) showed spherical shape with good particle size (133 nm), high zeta potential (-53.6 mV) and high entrapment efficiency (87.45%). Ex-vivo permeability study revealed that about 39% of the applied dose permeated within 15 min. Furthermore, in-vivo appraisal of therapeutic efficacy was performed using aged male Sprague-Dawley rats. After single application of 2 mg/kg sildenafil loaded in STGC-bilosomes, behavioral and biochemical evaluation was carried out. Behavioral assessment recorded an increased rats' potency manifested as 2 folds increase in intromission frequency and intromission ratio compared to untreated group. That was accompanied by significant increase in cGMP concentration in corpora cavernosa (P < 0.0001) confirming increased potency.

In most instances remote consultation reduced costs and time from referral to assessment and was associated with high patient satisfaction. However, a face-to-face follow up appointment was required in 13-72% of initial consultations, suggesting that remote consultation is only appropriate in selected cases. CONCLUSION Remote consultation is appropriate and preferable for ENT consultation in specific conditions and circumstances. Future research should look to better define those conditions and circumstances, and report using recognised quality standards and outcome measures.","Gupta, Tanya; Gkiousias, Vasileios; Bhutta, Mahmood F",Clinical otolaryngology : official journal of ENT-UK ; official journal of Netherlands Society for Oto-Rhino-Laryngology & Cervico-Facial Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1111/coa.13768; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33754458/,475
109798,Comparison of Feature Extraction Methods for Physiological Signals for Heat-Based Pain Recognition.,2021-07-15,"Although SARS-CoV-2 may primarily enter the cells of the lungs, the small bowel may also be an important entry or interaction site, as the enterocytes are rich in angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-2 receptors. The initial gastrointestinal symptoms that appear early during the course of Covid-19 support this hypothesis. Furthermore, SARS-CoV virions are preferentially released apically and not at the basement of the airway cells. Thus, in the setting of a productive infection of conducting airway epithelia, the apically released SARS-CoV may be removed by mucociliary clearance and gain access to the GI tract via a luminal exposure. In addition, post-mortem studies of mice infected by SARS-CoV have demonstrated diffuse damage to the GI tract, with the small bowel showing signs of enterocyte desquamation, edema, small vessel dilation and lymphocyte infiltration, as well as mesenteric nodes with severe hemorrhage and necrosis. Finally, the small bowel is rich in furin, a serine protease which can separate the S-spike of the coronavirus into two ""pinchers"" (S1 and 2). The separation of the S-spike into S1 and S2 is essential for the attachment of the virion to both the ACE receptor and the cell membrane. In this special review, we describe the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with the cell and enterocyte and its potential clinical implications.","Mönkemüller, Klaus; Fry, Lucia; Rickes, Steffen",Revista espanola de enfermedades digestivas : organo oficial de la Sociedad Espanola de Patologia Digestiva,https://doi.org/10.17235/reed.2020.7137/2020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32343593/,475

Recent research has shown that people's brain activity becomes synchronized with others' (inter-brain synchrony) during social engagement. However, little is known as to whether inter-brain synchrony relates to collective behavior within teams. Here, we merge the nascent field of group neuroscience with the extant literature of team dynamics and collective performance. We recruited 174 participants in groups of 4 and randomly assigned them to complete a series of problem-solving tasks either independently or as a team, while simultaneously recording each person's brain activity using an EEG hyperscanning setup. This design allowed us to examine the relationship between group identification and inter-brain synchrony in explaining collective performance. As expected, teammates identified more strongly with one another, cooperated more on an economic game, and outperformed the average individual on most problem-solving tasks. Crucially, inter-brain synchrony, but not self-reported group identification, predicted collective performance among teams. These results suggest that inter-brain synchrony can be informative in understanding collective performance among teams where self-report measures may fail to capture behavior.","Reinero, Diego A; Dikker, Suzanne; Van Bavel, Jay J",Social cognitive and affective neuroscience,https://doi.org/10.1093/scan/nsaa135; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32991728/,475

Objectives To investigate the habitual smoking effects in heart rate response and heart rate recovery after step test in athletes. Methods Seventy-eight physically healthy active athletes (45 non-smokers and 33 smokers) aging 27±8 years old, participated in this study. All participants completed the International Physical Activity Questionnaire and performed the six-minute step test. Cardiovascular parameters such (resting heart rate, peak heart rate, heart rate at 1 min after testing, heart rate recovery, recovery time, blood pressure at rest, and post-testing blood pressure) were recorded. Results Smoker-athletes had higher resting heart rate (76 ± 9bpm vs. 72 ± 10bpm, p<0.05), maximum heart rate (154 ± 18bpm vs. 147 ± 17bpm, p<0.05) and recovery time (7min 25sec ± 6min 31sec vs. 4min 21sec ± 4min 30sec, p<0.05) than non-smoker athletes. Scores from the IPAQ were approximately the same (M=7927 ± 10303, M= 6380 ± 4539, p<0.05). Conclusion Smoking was found to affect athletes' cardiovascular fitness.

111307,Area-based conservation in the twenty-first century.,2020-10-01,"OBJECTIVES To characterize the current economic burden of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and to determine which services increase the cost of VAP in North American hospitals. DESIGN AND SETTING We performed a retrospective, matched cohort analysis of mechanically ventilated patients enrolled in the North American Silver-Coated Endotracheal Tube (NASCENT) study, a prospective, randomized study conducted from 2002 to 2006 in 54 medical centers, including 45 teaching institutions (83.3%). METHODS Case patients with microbiologically confirmed VAP (n = 30)were identified from 542 study participants with claims data and were matched by use of a primary diagnostic code, and subsequently by the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, to control patients without VAP (n = 90). Costs were estimated by applying hospital-specific cost-to-charge ratios based on all-payer inpatient costs associated with VAP diagnosis-related groups. RESULTS Median total charges per patient were $198,200 for case patients and $96,540 for matched control patients (P < .001); corresponding median hospital costs were $76,730 for case patients and $41,250 for control patients (P = .001). After adjusting for diagnosis-related group payments, median losses to hospitals were $32,140 for case patients and $19,360 for control patients (P = .151). The median duration of intubation was longer for case patients than for control patients (10.1 days vs 4.7 days; P < .001), as were the median duration of intensive care unit stay (18.5 days vs 8.0 days; P < .001) and the median duration of hospitalization (26.5 days vs 14.0 days; P < .001). Examples of services likely to be directly related to VAP and having higher median costs for case patients were hospital care (P < .05) and respiratory therapy (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS VAP was associated with increased hospital costs, longer duration of hospital stay, and a higher number of hospital services being affected, which underscores the need for bundled measures to prevent VAP.

It is not known whether patients who do not fulfil such imaging criteria might benefit from treatment, but studies indicate that treatment based on non-contrast CT criteria may be safe. Tenecteplase has shown promising results in patients with acute ischemic stroke. The aim of the Tenecteplase in Wake-up Ischemic Stroke Trial (TWIST) is to compare the effect of thrombolytic treatment with tenecteplase and standard care versus standard care alone in patients with wake-up ischemic stroke selected by non-contrast CT. METHODS/DESIGN TWIST is an international, investigator-initiated, multi-centre, prospective, randomized-controlled, open-label, blinded end-point trial of tenecteplase (n = 300) versus standard care (n = 300) in patients who wake up with an acute ischemic stroke and can be treated within 4.5 h upon awakening. Seventy-seven centres in 10 countries (Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom) participate.

METHODS We merged by county CDC's SVI and the New York Times data on coronavirus cases. We estimated the association between the SVI and risk of death from COVID-19 per 100,000 people in counties with confirmed cases (n=2,755 U.S. counties) using multivariable Poisson regression. RESULTS The adjusted risk of COVID-19-related death followed a non-linear pattern, with the lowest risk among SVIs from 0.05 to 0.55 (roughly 3.1 to 3.5/100,000 people) and highest risk corresponding to SVI=0.95 (6.5/100,000). Compared with a SVI=0.35, SVIs of 0.85 and 0.95 were associated with 2.3 (2.1, 2.5) and 3.4 (3.1, 3.7) excess deaths per 100,000, respectively.

Cancer is now a major public health issue and one of the leading causes of mortality. Within the framework of an existing national cancer control plan, the National Cancer Centre of Mongolia (NCCM) aimed to implement 3D conformal radiation planning and linac-based treatment delivery. METHODS In 2018, an opportunity arose for collaboration between the Mongolia Society for Radiation Oncology (MOSTRO), the National Cancer Centre Mongolia (NCCM), the Asia-Pacific Radiation Oncology Special Interest Group (APROSIG) of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists (RANZCR) and the Asia-Pacific Special Interest Group (APSIG) of the Australasian College of Physical Scientists and Engineers in Medicine (ACPSEM) and radiation therapists (RTTs) from a range of Australian centres. We describe here the results to date of this collaboration. RESULTS Despite a number of significant technical and practical barriers, successful linac commissioning was achieved in 2019. Key factors for success included a leadership receptive to change management, stable bureaucracy and health systems, as well as a synchronised effort, regional cooperation and mentorship. CONCLUSION Future directions for ongoing collaborative efforts include a continued focus on education, practical training in radiotherapy planning and delivery and postgraduate education initiatives.

115882,A review of mesocosm experiments on heavy metals in marine environment and related issues of emerging concerns.,2020-10-20,"INTRODUCTION With the cessation of non-urgent clinical office visits due to the coronavirus, there has been a rapid shift to telephone and other virtual visits in outpatient practice. We conducted a survey to evaluate patients' perspective of telephone visits during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS Patients receiving a scheduled telephone call as a virtual visit from urologists at our clinic were asked to participate in a three-minute, self-administered, online questionnaire. After verbal permission was obtained, the survey was emailed to each participant. The outcomes evaluated were telephone visit satisfaction and preference for type of appointment. Non-parametric tests were used to analyze the results. The study was approved by the Sunnybrook Research Ethics Board. RESULTS A total of 102 participants were included; 96% of participants assessed the telephone visit as a positive experience in every survey question, while 45% expressed no preference. In those who expressed a preference, this was evenly divided between in-office visits and phone visits (p=0.0614). Participants who lived more than 75 km from the hospital were less likely to prefer an in-office visit compared to those residing locally (U=433, p=0.006; odds ratio 0.29, 95% confidence interval 0.106-0.779, p=0.0142). CONCLUSIONS In this survey, most participants assessed the telephone visit positively. Almost half had no preference and a similar proportion expressed a preference for in-office and telephone visits. Patients who resided farther from the hospital were more likely to prefer the telephone visit. This is the first study that we know of to assess patients' preferences regarding remote encounters in urology.","Locke, Jennifer; Herschorn, Sender; Neu, Sarah; Klotz, Laurence; Kodama, Ron; Carr, Lesley",Canadian Urological Association journal = Journal de l'Association des urologues du Canada,https://doi.org/10.5489/cuaj.6758; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32931728/,475

Our study's purpose was to determine CSF pressures in the myelomeningocele sac during mid-gestation in order to design an in-vitro model for evaluating different surgical methods used for watertight closure during in-utero SB repair. METHODS CSF pressures were measured during in-utero SB repair at mid-gestation. An in-vitro chicken thigh model, simulating fetal tissue, tested watertight closure when attached to the base of a water column. Primary closure methods were evaluated using defect sizes of 20 × 3 mm for minimal traction or 20 × 8 mm for moderate traction. Additionally, 3 common in-utero repair patches were compared using 15 × 15 mm defects. RESULTS Using 6-12.5 cm pre-determined CSF pressures, 165 in-vitro experiments were performed. Regardless of methodology we found that in 66 primary-based closures that minimal versus moderate wound edge traction provided better seals. The locking method was superior to the non-locking technique for watertight closure in 99 patch-based closures. CONCLUSIONS Minimal wound edge traction was best for primary closures, and locking sutures ideal for patch-based closures, however surgical techniques should be individualized to improve upon clinical outcomes.","Vu, Thai; Mann, Lovepreet K; Fletcher, Stephen A; Jain, Ranu; Garnett, Jeannine; Tsao, Kuojen; Austin, Mary T; Moise, Kenneth J; Johnson, Anthony; Shah, Manish N; Papanna, Ramesha",Journal of pediatric surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpedsurg.2019.05.024; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31255327/,475

The lack of detailed knowledge about all the constituents of the tumour microenvironment restricts the design of effective treatments. Nerves have been reported to contribute to the growth and maintenance of numerous tissues. The effects of sensory innervations on tumour growth remain unclear. Here, by using state-of-the-art techniques, including Cre/loxP technologies, confocal microscopy, in vivo-tracing and chemical denervation, we revealed the presence of sensory nerves infiltrating within the melanoma microenvironment, and affecting cancer progression. Strikingly, melanoma growth in vivo was accelerated following genetic ablation or chemical denervation of sensory nerves. In humans, a retrospective analysis of melanoma patients revealed that increased expression of genes related to sensory nerves in tumours was associated with better clinical outcomes. These findings suggest that sensory innervations counteract melanoma progression.

Our aim was to assess the temporal distribution of mortality risk associated with non-culprit CTO over years after STEMI. METHODS AND RESULTS The study included 8679 STEMI patients treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Kaplan-Meier cumulative mortality curves for non-culprit CTO vs. no CTO were compared with log-rank test, with landmarks set at 30 days and 1 year. Adjusted Cox regression models were constructed to assess the impact of non-culprit CTO on mortality over different time intervals. Tests for interaction were pre-specified between non-culprit CTO and acute heart failure and left ventricular ejection fraction. The primary outcome variable was all-cause mortality, and the median follow-up was 5 years. Non-culprit CTO was present in 11.6% of patients (n = 1010). Presence of a CTO was associated with increased early [30-day adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 1.91, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.54-2.36; P < 0.001] and late mortality (5-year adjusted HR 1.66, 95% CI 1.42-1.95; P < 0.001). Landmark analyses revealed an annual two-fold increase in mortality in patients with vs. without a CTO after the first year of follow-up. The observed pattern of mortality increase over time was independent of acute or chronic LV impairment. CONCLUSIONS Non-culprit CTO is independently associated with mortality over 5 years after primary PCI for STEMI, with a constant annual two-fold increase in the risk of death beyond the first year of follow-up.","Milasinovic, Dejan; Mladenovic, Djordje; Zaharijev, Stefan; Mehmedbegovic, Zlatko; Marinkovic, Jelena; Jelic, Dario; Zobenica, Vladimir; Radomirovic, Marija; Dedovic, Vladimir; Pavlovic, Andrija; Dobric, Milan; Stojkovic, Sinisa; Asanin, Milika; Vukcevic, Vladan; Stankovic, Goran",European heart journal.

120180,Benchmarking the in vitro toxicity and chemical composition of plastic consumer products.,2019,"NEW FINDINGS What is the central question of this study? Using human adductor pollicis muscle, we studied how contraction-induced reductions in twitch duration, without changes in twitch force, affects summation of twitch pairs into higher force contractions. What is the main finding and its importance? Abbreviating twitch duration with a brief contraction resulted in enhanced summation of fully fused twitch pairs, but impaired summation in partially-fused twitch pairs even after accounting for the differences in relaxation of the first twitch. An inherent mechanism which enhances relaxation without sacrificing force generation in forceful contractions would benefit cyclic muscle activities, such as locomotion. ABSTRACT During electrically-evoked contractions of skeletal muscle, the interplay between twitch duration and the time between electrical stimuli (inter-pulse interval, IPI) determines how effectively twitch forces summate into high force contractions. A brief muscle contraction can impair summation by abbreviating twitch duration, though it is not clear if these impairments occur at all physiologically relevant IPI. This study was designed to test how a brief contraction affects summation of nominally isometric twitch pairs with IPIs lasting 10-5000 ms. Left adductor pollicis muscles of human participants (n = 9) were electrically activated using stimulus pairs applied both before (Pre) and after (Post) a 10 Hz 1.0 s contraction. Force-time records were mathematically separated into Pulse 1 (single twitch) and Pulse 2 (summated twitch) components. The ratio of Pulse 2 peak force to Pulse 1 peak force was used as our measure of summation effectiveness. Consistent with the observed decline of Pulse 1 duration at Post relative to Pre (4.7 ± 0.6%; P < 0.001; duration was defined as the time from stimulation to the time required for active force to decline by 50%), summation effectiveness was higher at Pre than at Post at IPIs of 100-333 ms. Summation effectiveness was not different between Pre and Post at IPIs of 50-83 ms or 500-5000 ms. Intriguingly, summation effectiveness was higher at Post than at Pre at IPIs of 10-25 ms. In summary, a brief contraction has complex effects on the relationship between inter-pulse interval and summation effectiveness. Future experiments are needed to reveal the mechanisms behind this novel observation. This article is protected by copyright.

121295,Composition and Configuration Patterns in Multiple-View Visualizations.,2020-10-13,"BACKGROUND Pancreatic proteolytic digestive enzymes are a major extracellular barrier to the sucessful systemic delivery of biopharmaceuticals via the oral route, whereas in health in the lungs these powerful proteases are virtually absent from the extracellular fluids. Despite this, the absorption of some (but not all) natural peptides and proteins from the lungs may be poor, and one has to acknowledge that information on the activity and spatial distribution of proteolytic enzymes in the human lung is scarce. Here, we investigated expression patterns of a series of proteolytic enzymes in several human respiratory cell types on mRNA level in an attempt to better understand the fate of inhaled biopharmaceuticals. METHODS The mRNA expression of proteolytic enzymes (i.e., carboxypeptidases: CPA1, CPA2, CPB, CPM; gamma-glutamyltransferases: GGT1, GGT2; angiotensin-converting enzymes: ACE, ACE2; aminopeptidases: APA, APB, APN, APP1, APP2, APP3; endopeptidases: 24.11 (neprilysin), 24.15 (thimet oligopeptidase), 24.18 (meprin A); enteropeptidase; trypsin 1, trypsin 2; neutrophilic elastase; dipeptidyl peptidase 4; gamma-glutamylhydrolase) was investigated by semiquantitative RT-PCR in human bronchial (hBEpC, Calu-3, 16HBE14o-) and alveolar (A549) epithelial cells, respectively. Gastrointestinal Caco-2 cells were used as comparison. RESULTS Obvious differences were observed in proteinases' expression pattern between the investigated cell types. Although considered to be of bronchial epithelial phenotype, neither Calu-3 nor 16HBE14o- cells matched the mRNA expression pattern of hBEpC in primary culture. Of all investigated cell lines, Caco-2 expresses the highest number of proteases and peptidases. CONCLUSIONS Although mRNA expression does not necessarily signify enzyme functionality, our results provide the first comprehensive analysis of peptidase and protease expression and distribution in human lung epithelial cells and are the basis for further investigations.","Baginski, Leonie; Tachon, Gaëlle; Falson, Françoise; Patton, John S; Bakowsky, Udo; Ehrhardt, Carsten",Journal of aerosol medicine and pulmonary drug delivery,https://doi.org/10.1089/jamp.2010.0842; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21410325/,475

In this paper, graphene oxide was used as a template to prepare ZIF-67, and GO/ZIF-67 was successfully prepared. GO/ZIF-67 was used for the first time to remove boron from water. SEM, XRD, and other characterization methods were used to confirm the structure. The adsorption kinetics, adsorption isotherm, adsorption thermodynamics, and adsorption mechanism of boron by GO/ZIF-67 were studied in this paper. The adsorption capacity of GO/ZIF-67 for boron is up to 66.65 mg·g-1 at 25 °C, and adsorption process reaches equilibrium in 400 min. Adsorption kinetics indicates that the adsorption process conforms to the pseudo-first-order kinetic model, and adsorption thermodynamics indicates that the adsorption process is a spontaneous endothermic process controlled by entropy change. The adsorption capacity of boron by GO/ZIF-67 does not decrease significantly after four cycles. The adsorption of boron by GO/ZIF-67 has both chemical and physical adsorption. From Zeta potential and adsorption kinetics, it can be seen that there is physical adsorption during the adsorption process and boron mainly has positive charge on the surface of GO/ZIF-67 and graphene oxide hydroxyl bonding. Based on the adsorption thermodynamics and XPS, it is known that there is chemisorption during the adsorption process, and mainly the combination of boron and cobalt sites.","Hu, Guangzhuang; Zhang, Wei; Chen, Yuantao; Xu, Cheng; Liu, Rong; Han, Zhen",Environmental science and pollution research international,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-08018-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418092/,475

The following databases were systematically searched: CCTR, CDSR, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsycInfo, and Medline through to November 2015, for studies reporting on VAD recipients receiving ≥ 2 sessions of aerobic training. Citations were considered for inclusion, and data were extracted in included studies as well as quality assessed, each by two investigators independently. Random-effects meta-analyses were performed where possible. The meta-analysis showed that compared to usual care, exercise rehabilitation significantly improved peak VO2 (n = 74, mean difference = 1.94 mL kg-1 min-1, 95% CI 0.63-3.26, p = 0.004) and 6-min walk test distance (n = 52, mean difference = 42.46 m, 95% CI 8.45-76.46, p = 0.01). No significant differences were found for the ventilatory equivalent slope (VE/VCO2) or ventilatory anaerobic threshold (VAT). In the six studies which reported QoL, exercise rehabilitation was beneficial in four, with no difference observed in two studies. Exercise rehabilitation is associated with improved outcomes in VAD recipients, and therefore should be more systematically delivered in this population.","Grosman-Rimon, Liza; Lalonde, Spencer D; Sieh, Nina; Pakosh, Maureen; Rao, Vivek; Oh, Paul; Grace, Sherry L",Heart failure reviews,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10741-018-9695-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29623546/,475

MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 66 patients with 264 central incisors in good periodontal health were included in this cross-sectional study. CBCT images were used to assess gingiva and alveolar bone thickness of the maxillary and mandibular incisors at four vertical levels. Cephalometric analysis was used to assess the sagittal profile of the craniofacial structures. Gingival thickness was compared in patients with different craniofacial profiles based on ANB value. Linear regression coefficients adjusted by age and gender were used to evaluate the correlation between gingival thickness and the cephalometric parameters. RESULTS Individuals with a smaller ANB value (ANB< 2) presented with thinner supporting tissue and a keratinized gingiva width in the anterior zone. Labial gingival thickness on the mandibular incisors at the cementoenamel junction (G1) and at the alveolar bone crest (G2) was positively related to cephalometric measures, indicating a maxillae-mandibular sagittal relationship (ANB value, Wits appraisal, A-NPog value). CONCLUSIONS A moderate correlation was found between mandibular gingival thickness and the sagittal craniofacial profile. Patients with a concave craniofacial profile had a smaller keratinized gingiva width and gingival thickness in the aesthetic zone. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Knowledge of these features on supporting tissue and their correlations with craniofacial morphology will help clinicians to develop a reasonable treatment plan and make decisions to achieve the best aesthetic outcome.","Cha, Sa; Lee, Sueng Min; Zhang, Chengxiaoxue; Tan, Zhen; Zhao, Qing",Clinical oral investigations,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00784-020-03444-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32648062/,475

129412,Editorial.,2021-01-27,"INTRODUCTION With an average incidence rate of 11%, chronic pain is considered the most serious complication of inguinal hernioplasty after surgical site infection. One of the proposed solutions to this problem is to use tissue adhesive for mesh fixation, which helps prevent nerve and tissue damage. AIM The goal of this study was to compare mesh fixation with the use of sutures vs. adhesive in Lichtenstein's inguinal hernia repair in a randomized, double-blind one-center study. MATERIAL AND METHODS The study group consisted of 41 males with primary inguinal hernia undergoing Lichtenstein's repair (20 - adhesive; 21 - suture) and remaining in follow-up from July 2008 to November 2010. Randomization took place during the operation. The follow-up was performed by one surgeon (blinded) according to a pre-agreed schedule; the end-of-study unblinding was performed during the last follow-up visit, usually 16 months postoperatively. RESULTS In 1 patient from the ""adhesive"" group, a recurrence was observed one year after the initial repair. The early postoperative pain was less intense in this group. In later postoperative periods the method of mesh fixation had no influence on the pain experienced by the patient. Other complications were not correlated with the method of mesh fixation. CONCLUSIONS In this randomized, one-center double-blind clinical study of males with primary inguinal hernia it has been show during follow-up that the use of Glubran 2 cyanoacrylate adhesive for mesh implant fixation yields similar recurrence and chronic pain rates as the classical suture technique. In the early postoperative period, the pain reported by these patients was relatively weaker; patients undergoing adhesive mesh fixation experienced a quicker return to daily household activities.","Dąbrowiecki, Stanisław; Pierściński, Stanisław; Szczęsny, Wojciech",Wideochirurgia i inne techniki maloinwazyjne = Videosurgery and other miniinvasive techniques,https://doi.org/10.5114/wiitm.2011.27429; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23256009/,475

Cr2, which encodes complement receptors 1 and 2 (CR1/CR2; CD35/CD21), is a strong candidate gene for lupus susceptibility within this interval based on structural and functional alterations in its protein products. CR1-related protein/gene Y (Crry) lies 10 kb from Cr2 and encodes a ubiquitously expressed complement regulatory protein that could also play a role in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus. Crry derived from B6.Sle1c congenic mice migrated at a higher m.w. by SDS-PAGE compared with B6 Crry, as a result of differential glycosylation. A single-nucleotide polymorphism in the first short consensus repeat of Sle1c Crry introduced a novel N-linked glycosylation site likely responsible for this structural alteration. Five additional single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the signal peptide and short consensus repeat 1 of Sle1c Crry were identified. However, the cellular expression of B6 and B6.Sle1c Crry and their ability to regulate the classical pathway of complement were not significantly different. Although soluble Sle1c Crry regulated the alternative pathway of complement more efficiently than B6 Crry, as a membrane protein, it regulated the alternative pathway equivalently to B6 Crry. These data fail to provide evidence for a functional effect of the structural alterations in Sle1c Crry and suggest that the role of Cr2 in the Sle1c autoimmune phenotypes can be isolated in recombinant congenic mice containing both genes.","Tchepeleva, Svetlana N; Thurman, Joshua M; Ruff, Katherine; Perkins, Stephen J; Morel, Laurence; Boackle, Susan A",Journal of immunology,https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.1000783; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20660348/,475

MATERIALS AND METHODS A broad control system consists of information such as (i) the area of the tumour tissue for feedback control, (ii) the set-point temperature and (iii) the control law. The proposed approach has advanced knowledge in (i) and (ii) in particular. RFA is known to be limited by tissue dehydration that occurs around the electrode, which results in impedance such that no further energy can be delivered to the tissues. We proposed the notion of ""energy gate"", an area on the electrode, which is not covered by the dehydrated tissue and through which energy can still be delivered to the surrounding tissues. Given a specific size of energy gate, both (i) the area of the tissue in which the temperature is monitored and (ii) the set-point temperature were determined. A reliable finite element model or simulator for a commercially available electrode was used and the tissue surrounding the RFA electrode was divided into three areas for a comprehensive study of the issues (i) and (ii). Porcine liver tissue (30 specimens in total) and a custom-made RFA device with a RF power generator (100 W and 460 ± 30 kHz) and a Covidien cool-tip electrode (17 gauge and 30 mm exposure) were used to validate the findings regarding the area of the tissue for feedback control and the set-point temperature. RESULTS The size of coagulation zone achieved was maximised when the area of tissue surrounding the middle part of the active tip (i.e. Point 7) was used for feedback control and when the set-point temperature was set to 90 ^ C (this temperature is determined based on the energy gate through a trial-and-error procedure). At both 80 and 90 ^ C, the coagulation zones generated using Area II were significantly larger than that generated using Area I (p = 0.0028 and 0.0003, respectively) and Area III (P = 0.0010 and < 0.0001, respectively). A similar finding regarding the control area and set-point temperature was confirmed by the in-vitro experiment. When compared with Point a (p < 0.0001) and Point c (p < 0.0001), the largest coagulation zone (1066.7 ± 36.1 mm2) was achieved by controlling the temperature of the tissue area surrounding the middle part of the active tip (i.e. Point b) at 90 ^ C. CONCLUSION The judicious selection of the control area within the biological tissue for temperature monitoring and the set-point temperature for feedback control is critical in increasing the size of the coagulation zone in the treatment of RFA.","Zhang, Bing; Moser, Michael A J; Zhang, Edwin M; Luo, Yigang; Zhang, Wenjun","International journal of hyperthermia : the official journal of European Society for Hyperthermic Oncology, North American Hyperthermia Group",https://doi.org/10.1080/02656736.2016.1263365; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27868461/,475

TIPS is not always technically feasible, due to the complete hepatic venous thrombosis. Direct intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (DIPS) is an alternative method for decompression of portal hypertension. This is a retrospective, single-center study aiming to evaluate the outcome of ultrasound (US)-guided DIPS in patients with BCS. MATERIALS AND METHODS Between 2003 and 2016, six patients with BCS were treated with US-guided DIPS. Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)-covered stents were used in two patients and bare-metal stents in four patients. Mean follow-up time was 71.4 months (range: 21-164). Technical/clinical success, technical difficulties, and complications of DIPS were analyzed. RESULTS Technical success without complications was achieved in all patients (100%). In one patient, DIPS was performed through the right femoral vein, without significant amelioration of portal hypertension (clinical success 83.3%). In four out of five patients, ascites and variceal bleeding resolved completely and in the other one ascites was relieved. Six- and 12-month primary patency rates were 100% in PTFE-covered stent group when compared with bare-metal stent group, the rates were 33% and 0%, respectively. CONCLUSION US-guided DIPS is a safe and effective alternative technique for patients with BCS, with significant clinical improvement.","Hatzidakis, Adam; Galanakis, Nikolaos; Kehagias, Elias; Samonakis, Dimitrios; Koulentaki, Mairi; Matrella, Erminia; Tsetis, Dimitrios",Interventional medicine & applied science,https://doi.org/10.1556/1646.9.2017.2.14; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28932502/,475
130987,Factors affecting the chemical composition of precipitation in Syria.,2020-05-16,"The parapoxvirus Orf virus (ORFV), has long been recognized for its immunomodulatory properties in permissive and non-permissive animal species. Here, a new recombinant ORFV expressing the full-length spike (S) protein of Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) was generated and its immunogenicity and protective efficacy were evaluated in pigs. The PEDV S was inserted into the ORFV121 gene locus, an immunomodulatory gene that inhibits activation of the NF-κB signalling pathway and contributes to ORFV virulence in the natural host. The recombinant ORFV-PEDV-S virus efficiently and stably expressed the PEDV S protein in cell culture in vitro. Three intramuscular (IM) immunizations with the recombinant ORFV-PEDV-S in 3-week-old pigs elicited robust serum IgG, IgA and neutralizing antibody responses against PEDV. Additionally, IM immunization with the recombinant ORFV-PEDV-S virus protected pigs from clinical signs of porcine epidemic diarrhoea (PED) and reduced virus shedding in faeces upon challenge infection. These results demonstrate the suitability of ORFV121 gene locus as an insertion site for heterologous gene expression and delivery by ORFV-based viral vectors. Additionally, the results provide evidence of the potential of ORFV as a vaccine delivery vector for enteric viral diseases of swine.

Although personality disorders are common in patients with mood disorders, it remains unknown whether personality disorder affects treatment outcomes in mood disorders. We aim to review currently available evidence regarding the role of personality disorder on pharmacological interventions in randomised controlled trials for adults with mood disorders. METHODS AND ANALYSIS A systematic search of Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Clinical Trials (CENTRAL) via cochranelibrary.com, PubMed via PubMed, EMBASE via embase.com, PsycINFO via Ebsco and CINAHL Complete via Ebsco databases will be conducted to identify randomised controlled trials that have investigated pharmacological interventions in participants aged 18 years or older for mood disorders (ie, depressive disorders and bipolar spectrum disorders) and have also included assessment of personality disorder. One reviewer will screen studies against the predetermined eligibility criteria, and a second reviewer will confirm eligible studies. Data will be extracted by two independent reviewers. Methodological quality and risk of bias will be assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. A systematic review, and if sufficient evidence is identified, a meta-analysis will be completed.

A separate analysis for bacteraemia and PSI 4-5 showed an OR of 17.5 (p = 0.008) and 2.7 (p = 0.092), respectively.

However, a limited theoretical basis underpins how cultural adaptations are believed to augment intervention effectiveness. We undertook a realist review to synthesise existing literature on culturally adapted type 2 diabetes prevention interventions, to develop a framework that shows 'how' cultural adaptation works, for 'whom' and in 'what contexts'. METHODS We followed the stepped methodological approach of realist review. Our work concluded a European-wide project (EuroDHYAN), and core studies were identified from the preceding EuroDHYAN reviews. Data were extracted, coded into themes and synthesised to create 'Context-Mechanism-Outcome' configurations and to generate a refined explanatory framework. RESULTS We identified eight core intervention papers. From this evidence, and supporting literature, we examined the 'Team' domain of cultural adaptation and identified a mechanism of shared cultural identity which we theorised as contributing to strong team-participant relationships. We also identified four key contexts which influenced intervention outcomes: 'research setting' and 'heterogeneous populations' (intrinsic to the intervention) and 'broader environment' and 'socio-cultural stress' (extrinsic barriers). CONCLUSIONS This work instigates research into the mechanisms of cultural adaptation which, if pursued, will allow a more nuanced understanding of how to apply adaptations, and for whom. In practice we recommend greater consideration of heterogeneous and intersecting population characteristics; how intervention design can safeguard sustainability; and how the four key contexts identified influence how, and whether, these interventions work.","Davidson, Emma M; Krasuska, Marta; Jenum, Anne Karen; Gill, Jason M R; Beune, Erik; Stronks, Karien; van Valkengoed, Irene G M; Diaz, Esperanza; Sheikh, Aziz",Diabetic medicine : a journal of the British Diabetic Association,https://doi.org/10.1111/dme.14584; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33838051/,475

However, no study has specifically evaluated the relationship between obesity and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). RESEARCH QUESTION Is obesity associated with increased incidence of VAP? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS Post-hoc analysis of the NUTRIREA-2 open-label RCT, performed in 44 French ICUs. Adults receiving invasive mechanical ventilation and vasopressor support for shock, and parenteral nutrition or enteral nutrition were included. Obesity was defined as body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m2 at ICU admission. VAP diagnosis was adjudicated by an independent blinded committee, based on all available clinical, radiological, and microbiological data. Only first VAP episodes were taken into account. Incidence of VAP was analyzed using Fine and Gray model, with extubation, and death as competing risks. RESULTS 699 (30%) of the 2325 included patients had obesity. 224 first VAP episodes were diagnosed (60, and 164 in obese, and non-obese groups; respectively). The incidence of VAP at day 28 was 8.6% vs 10.1% in the two groups (HR: 0.85, (95% CI 0.63-1.14), p=0.26). After adjustment on gender, McCabe score, age, anti-ulcer treatment, and SOFA at randomization, the incidence of VAP remained non-significant between obese and non-obese patients (HR 0.893 (95% CI 0.66-1.2), p=0.46). Although no significant difference was found in duration of mechanical ventilation, and ICU length of stay; 90-day mortality was significantly lower in obese than in non-obese patients (272 of 692 (39.3%) patients vs 718 of 1605 (44.7%), p=0.02). In a sub-group of patients (n=123) with available pepsin, and alpha-amylase measurements, no significant difference was found in rate of abundant microaspiration of gastric contents, or oropharyngeal secretions between obese and non-obese patients.

In case of an unanticipated difficult airway, the complication rate increases with the number of intubation attempts. Recently, McGrath MAC (McGrath) video laryngoscopy has become a widely accepted method for securing an airway by tracheal intubation because it allows the visualisation of the glottis without a direct line of sight. Several studies and case reports have highlighted the benefit of the video laryngoscope in the visualisation of the glottis and found it to be superior in difficult intubation situations. The aim of this study was to compare the first-pass intubation success rate using the (McGrath) video laryngoscope compared with conventional direct laryngoscopy in surgical patients. METHODS AND ANALYSIS The EMMA trial is a multicentre, open-label, patient-blinded, randomised controlled trial. Consecutive patients requiring tracheal intubation are randomly allocated to either the McGrath video laryngoscope or direct laryngoscopy using the Macintosh laryngoscope. The expected rate of successful first-pass intubation is 95% in the McGrath group and 90% in the Macintosh group. Each group must include a total of 1000 patients to achieve 96% power for detecting a difference at the 5% significance level. Successful intubation with the first attempt is the primary endpoint. The secondary endpoints are the time to intubation, attempts for successful intubation, the necessity of alternatives, visualisation of the glottis using the Cormack & Lehane score and percentage of glottic opening score and definite complications.

135641,Coronavirus diaries: social media in an unsocial age.,2020-06-26,"Susceptibility testing with the use of surrogate agents is common among clinical microbiology laboratories. One such example is oxacillin and cefoxitin for β-lactams against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). This study aimed to assess the surrogate predictive value (SPV) of oxacillin and cefoxitin for the susceptibility of commonly utilized parenteral β-lactams against MSSA as well as to evaluate the concordance between predictive susceptibility testing and the in vivo exposures for ceftriaxone. Broth microdilution MICs were determined for cefazolin, cefoxitin, ceftaroline, ceftriaxone, nafcillin, and oxacillin against a national collection of 1238 MSSA from US hospitals. Pharmacodynamic profiling was utilized to establish a clinical breakpoint for commonly utilized doses of ceftriaxone. Oxacillin had good SPVs for all the β-lactams tested, whereas cefoxitin produced unacceptable major errors for all four agents and thus appears to be an unacceptable susceptibility surrogate. While oxacillin is an adequate surrogate based on the currently defined laboratory criteria, our data also suggest that caution should be exercised when incorporating this testing approach in the clinical setting in view of the fact that the MIC distribution of MSSA coupled with the commonly utilized low doses of ceftriaxone may result in inadequate in vivo exposures against this pathogen.","Kang, Nayon; Housman, Seth T; Nicolau, David P",Pathogens,https://doi.org/10.3390/pathogens4030599; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26264030/,475
136315,Use of routine interventions in labour and birth in Canadian hospitals: comparing results of the 1993 and 2007 Canadian hospital maternity policies and practices surveys.,2011,"BACKGROUND Icodextrin, a glucose polymer with a polydispersity [ratio of weight-average molecular weight (Mw) to number-average molecular weight] of approximately 2.6, has been shown, compared with glucose, to provide superior ultrafiltration (UF) efficiency [ratio of UF to carbohydrate (CHO) absorbed] when used as an osmotic agent during a long-dwell peritoneal dialysis exchange. In an experimental rabbit model, we evaluated the effect of Mw on the UF and UF efficiency of glucose polymers with low polydispersity. METHODS A crossover trial in female New Zealand White rabbits (2.20 - 2.65 kg) with surgically implanted peritoneal catheters evaluated two glucose polymers at nominal concentrations of 7.5 g/dL: a 6K polymer (Mw: 6.4 kDa; polydispersity: 2.3) and a 19K polymer (Mw: 18.8 kDa; polydispersity: 2.0). Rabbits were randomized to receive either the 6K (n = 11) or the 19K (n = 12) solution during the first exchange (40 mL/kg body weight). The alternative solution was evaluated in a second exchange 3 days later. During each 4-hour dwell, the UF and total glucose polymer CHO absorbed were determined. RESULTS The UF was higher for the 6K (p < 0.0001) than for the 19K polymer (mean ± standard deviation: 73.6 ± 30.8 mL vs. 43.0 ± 20.2 mL), as was the amount of CHO absorbed (42.5% ± 9.8% vs. 35.7% ± 11.0%, p = 0.021). In spite of higher CHO absorption, an approximately 50% higher (p = 0.029) UF efficiency was achieved with the 6K polymer (28.3 ± 18.8 mL/g) than with the 19K polymer (19.0 ± 11.3 mL/g). The results were independent of the order of the experimental exchanges. CONCLUSIONS Glucose polymers with low polydispersity are effective osmotic agents in a rabbit model. The low-Mw polymer was more effective at generating UF and had a higher UF efficiency, but those results came at the expense of the polymer being more readily absorbed from the peritoneal cavity.","Leypoldt, John K; Hoff, Catherine M; Piscopo, Dean; Carr, Seraya N; Svatek, Jessica M; Holmes, Clifford J",Peritoneal dialysis international : journal of the International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis,https://doi.org/10.3747/pdi.2012.00009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23123667/,475

There are no widely available licensed therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2, highlighting an urgent need for effective interventions. The virus enters host cells through binding of a receptor-binding domain within its trimeric spike glycoprotein to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. In this article, we describe the generation and characterization of a panel of murine mAbs directed against the receptor-binding domain. One mAb, 2B04, neutralized wild-type SARS-CoV-2 in vitro with remarkable potency (half-maximal inhibitory concentration of <2 ng/ml). In a murine model of SARS-CoV-2 infection, 2B04 protected challenged animals from weight loss, reduced lung viral load, and blocked systemic dissemination. Thus, 2B04 is a promising candidate for an effective antiviral that can be used to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Alsoussi, Wafaa B; Turner, Jackson S; Case, James B; Zhao, Haiyan; Schmitz, Aaron J; Zhou, Julian Q; Chen, Rita E; Lei, Tingting; Rizk, Amena A; McIntire, Katherine M; Winkler, Emma S; Fox, Julie M; Kafai, Natasha M; Thackray, Larissa B; Hassan, Ahmed O; Amanat, Fatima; Krammer, Florian; Watson, Corey T; Kleinstein, Steven H; Fremont, Daved H; Diamond, Michael S; Ellebedy, Ali H",Journal of immunology,https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.2000583; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32591393/,475

In this study, we seek to evaluate the haptic perception evoked from concurrent stimulation trains through multiple channels using transcutaneous nerve stimulation. METHODS A 2x8 electrode grid was used to deliver current to the median and ulnar nerves in the upper arm. Different electrodes were first selected to activate the sensory axons, which can elicit sensations at different locations of the hand. Charge-balanced bipolar stimulation was then delivered to two sets of electrodes concurrently with a phase delay (dual stimulation) to determine whether the evoked sensation can be reconstructed from sensations of single stimulation delivered separately at different locations (single stimulation) along the electrode grid. The temporal delay between the two stimulation locations trains were altered to evaluate potential interference. The short-term stability of the haptic sensation within a testing session was also evaluated. RESULTS The evoked sensation during dual stimulation was largely a direct summation of the sensation from single stimulations. The delay between the two stimulation locations had minimal effect on the evoked sensations, which was also stable in the short-termover repeated testing within a session. CONCLUSION Our results indicated that the haptic sensations at different regions of the hand can be constructed by combining individual the response from multiple stimulation trains locations directly. The interference between stimulations were minimal. SIGNIFICANCE The outcomes will allow us to construct specific haptic sensation patterns when the prosthesis interacts with different objects, which may help improve user embodiment of the prosthesis.","Vargas, Luis; Whitehouse, Graham; Huang, Helen; Zhu, Yong; Hu, Xiaogang",IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering,https://doi.org/10.1109/tbme.2019.2895575; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30703003/,475

METHODS As a proxy for home or in-lab testing, validation of a symptom-based measure of OSA risk is presented, based on an on-going larger prospective study of 156 family medicine patients with OSA (88 women, 68 men; mean age 57) and 60 Control participants (36 women, 24 men; mean age 54) recruited from the community. Participants completed the Sleep Symptom Checklist (SSC) as well as a range of other self-report measures; primary care patients also underwent a polysomnographic sleep study. RESULTS Results show (a) that individuals with OSA reported more symptoms on the SSC related to Insomnia, Daytime Symptoms, Sleep Disorders and Psychological Maladjustment than the Control group (all p<.001), and (b) that their sleep-related symptoms were significantly more severe than those of Controls. In addition, (c) several PSG indices in recently diagnosed, untreated individuals with OSA were significantly correlated with SSC measured Sleep Disorder symptoms, and (d) SSC scores significantly distinguished OSA participants from Controls. CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that family practitioners can effectively pre-screen patients for possible OSA by inquiring about 5 items that form the SSC Sleep Disorders subscale. If OSA is suspected, there are a range of behavioral techniques which we recommend to improve symptoms. The current pandemic causes us to reflect that provisional targeting of symptoms and guidance as to mitigation strategies while waiting for specialist care could serve patients well at any time.","Rizzo, Dorrie; Libman, Eva; Baltzan, Marc; Fichten, Catherine; Bailes, Sally",Journal of clinical sleep medicine : JCSM : official publication of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine,https://doi.org/10.5664/jcsm.8922; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33100266/,475

OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to describe the impact of COVID-19 emergency on pharmaceutical care provided by pharmacists during the first wave of the pandemic. Issues related to pharmacist's involvement in the pandemic management were: changes in activities, support received by authorities and pharmacists' own perceived role in the Health System. METHODS A cross-sectional study based on a web survey was conducted between May and June 2020 collecting information from pharmacists, members of Italian Society of Clinical Pharmacy and Therapeutics. 113 (11.4%) completed the questionnaire. The cohort was divided in 2 arms: pharmacists who worked in severely COVID-19 affected areas (High Spread Regions) and those employed in less affected areas (Low Spread Regions). RESULTS The changes in pharmacy work settings reflected the increase of logistics area and non-sterile clinical galenic, and reduction of clinical tasks. The most demanding challenge was referred to shortages of medical devices and drugs, 61/113 pharmacists reported difficulty in obtaining products compliant to quality standards. National Institutions and Regional Governments provided a greater perceived support. More than 50% of participants felt that their role did not change if compared to other health professionals. CONCLUSIONS Despite some limitations related to their clinical activity, pharmacists played a crucial role in supplying personal protective equipment, medical devices and medications to improve health outcomes during this emergency. The results may guide pharmacists in future actions to improve the management of the pandemic.","Damuzzo, Vera; Bertin, Riccardo; Mengato, Daniele; Chiumente, Marco; Rivano, Melania; Palozzo, Angelo Claudio",Journal of pharmacy practice,https://doi.org/10.1177/08971900211023643; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34126804/,475

Mutations in the gene encoding the CFTR protein cause cystic fibrosis. CFTR is expressed in the epithelial cells of the lungs, pancreas, intestines, and other organs. In the peripheral and central nervous system, CFTR expression has been detected in the neurons of rat brains, ganglion cells of rat hearts, human hypothalamus, human spinal cord, and human spinal and sympathetic ganglia. However, CFTR has not been identified in other parts of the nervous system. In this study, we used immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, and laser-assisted microdissection (LMD) followed by reverse transcriptase (RT) PCR to identify CFTR proteins and messenger RNA in human and rat paracervical ganglion cells. CFTR and its gene expression were both detected in paracervical ganglion cells, a finding that might link this important protein to the neuronal regulation of female urogenital function. These findings could provide new insights into the symptoms related to the reproductive system frequently observed in female cystic fibrosis patients.","Su, Meng; Guo, Yong; Zhao, Yingying; Korteweg, Christine; Gu, Jiang",Biochemistry and cell biology = Biochimie et biologie cellulaire,https://doi.org/10.1139/o10-016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20651848/,475

We successfully isolated two PEDV isolates (strain shxx1902 and shxx1912) from clinical samples in this farm using suspension Vero cells in February and December, respectively. The third PEDV strain (SH1302) tested positive in the other farm of Shanghai in 2013 was also isolated using suspension Vero cells. The three isolates were better adapted to growth in adherent Vero cells through serial passages in the suspension Vero cells. The three isolated strains were detected positive by an immune- fluorescence assay and observed through electron microscopy. Phylogenetic analysis of the complete genomic sequence demonstrated that shxx1902(the 5th passage) and shxx1912(the 5th passage) clustered with a new GII subgroup (GII-c), which consisted of SINDEL strains from America (e.g., OH851), and their S gene belonged to GII-a. Both the strains(the 35th passage) have occurred dramatic changes in their genomes compared with the 5th passage. The 5th and 35th SH1302 belonged to GI-b genotype. The anti-N protein antibody titer of the strain shxx1902 was elevated to the same level as the vaccine strain(CV777) in mice.

Lactobacillus plantarum (L. plantarum) has substantial application potential in the food and medical industries because of its probiotic properties. Alphacoronaviruses, especially porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), cause high morbidity and mortality in piglets resulting in economic loss. The co-infection of the two viruses is becoming increasingly frequent. Therefore, it is particularly important to develop a new drug to prevent diarrhea infected with mixed viruses in piglets. In this study, we first constructed an anchored expression vector with CWA (C-terminal cell wall anchor) on L. plantarum. Second, we constructed two recombinant L. plantarum strains that anchored IFN-λ3 via pgsA (N‑terminal transmembrane anchor) and CWA. Third, we demonstrated that both recombinant strains possess strong antiviral effects against coronavirus infection in the intestinal porcine epithelial cell line J2 (IPEC-J2). However, recombinant L. plantarum with the CWA anchor exhibited a more powerful antiviral effect than recombinant L. plantarum with pgsA. Consistent with this finding, Lb.plantarum-pSIP-409-IFN-λ3-CWA enhanced the expression levels of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) (ISG15, OASL, and Mx1) in IPEC-J2 cells more than did recombinant Lb.plantarum-pSIP-409-pgsA'-IFN-λ3. Our study verifies that recombinant L. plantarum inhibits PEDV and TGEV infection in IPEC-J2 cells, which may offer great potential for use as a novel oral antiviral agent in therapeutic applications for combating porcine epidemic diarrhea and transmissible gastroenteritis. This study was the first study that recombinant L. plantarum suppresses PEDV and TGEV infection of IPEC-J2 cells.","Liu, Yong-Shi; Liu, Qiong; Jiang, Yan-Long; Yang, Wen-Tao; Huang, Hai-Bin; Shi, Chun-Wei; Yang, Gui-Lian; Wang, Chun-Feng",Journal of microbiology and biotechnology,https://doi.org/10.4014/jmb.1909.09041; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31838830/,475

We surveyed persons living with HIV (PLWH) in different countries to investigate whether their medical follow-up and psychosocial well-being had been compromised due to COVID-19 and associated restrictions. METHODS In April 2020, a cross-sectional survey among PLWH was conducted using a web-based multilingual questionnaire. The research tool assessed HIV follow-up, psychosocial well-being, COVID-19 (flu-like) symptoms and prevention measures. Consenting respondents provided answers anonymously. RESULTS 317 PLWH were included (mean age 43.4±11.7; 71.6% male); 60.3% of participants resided in Belgium and Brazil. 140 (44.2%) reported experiencing a cold with at least one flu-like symptom since January 2020. Of the 18 who reported COVID-19 test results, 4 (22.2%) were positive. Seventy-four (23.3%) respondents screened positive for major depressive disorders, while 72 (22.7%) had generalized anxiety disorders. Fifty-six (17.7%) respondents reported difficulties in obtaining antiretroviral medications because of COVID-19-related measures. Adaptations of HIV care during the COVID-19 outbreak included greater quantities of antiretroviral refill in 67 (21.1%), phone consultations in 25 (7.9%), and new refill sites in 12 (3.9%). Factors associated with reduced risk of experiencing flu-like symptoms included flu vaccination during the last 12 months (p=0.005) and adaptations of HIV care during the COVID-19 pandemic (p=0.010).

Although loneliness is increasingly recognized as an important public health concern, no studies have investigated the potential of meaning in life to protect against loneliness. Based on an explorative interdisciplinary research strategy that comprises data from a cohort study, a strategic review of empirical literature and a conceptual analysis of the concept of meaning in life we explore the support for potential links between meaning in life and the protection against loneliness. We propose three different explanatory mechanisms; (i) that meaning in life promotes a positive orientation toward others, (ii) that meaning in life enhances interpersonal appeal and (iii) that meaning in life promotes a better ability to cope with loneliness. Theoretically, we explore the idea that the value of meaning in life ultimately concerns a social need to contribute to the realization of value that, at least in principle, can be shared and recognized by others. When people realize the value of meaning in life, they partake in a community of shared values, which links them to a social world in a way that may protect against the feeling of loneliness. Jointly the analyses point to the need for prospective studies on the role of meaning in life as a protective factor against loneliness and a potential novel focus for loneliness interventions.","Folker, Anna Paldam; Lauridsen, Sigurd Mørk; Hegelund, Emilie Rune; Wimmelmann, Cathrine Lawaetz; Flensborg-Madsen, Trine",Health promotion international,https://doi.org/10.1093/heapro/daaa081; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32830234/,475

Overall survival (OS) was calculated from surgery to death or the last contact. Progression-free survival (PFS) was calculated from surgery to progression. The last follow-up was November 2018. RESULTS The median OS was significantly shorter in PLR>150 patients (p=0.005; 10 vs 17 months). And the median OS was significantly shorter in NLR>4 patients too (p=0.010; 11 vs 17 months). In multivariate analysis, Karnofsky performance score 4 (HR:2.14, 95% CI:1.11-4.14; p=0.023) were statistically significant for OS were found to be independent prognostic factor.

145013,News at a glance.,2021-03-19,"There is currently no curative drug therapy for COVID-19. The spread of the virus seems relentless despite the unprecedented epidemiological measures. Prevention remains the only feasible option to stop the pandemic; without population-level vaccination, we are unlikely to regain the quality of social life and the unrestricted economy/commerce we enjoyed before. Anti-vaxxers and conspiracy theorists are seemingly oblivious to the detrimental effect of COVID-19 both at an individual and societal level. These groups have (and probably will) continue to attempt to undermine efforts to eradicate the virus despite the fact that the major reduction in morbidity/and mortality of infectious diseases of the past century was achieved through the development of vaccines and improved hygiene. Conspiracy theories are directly associated with reduced vaccine uptake and unfortunately neither anti-vaxxers nor vaccine hesitants cannot be persuaded (debunked) with logical arguments; hence, prescribers must not only be aware of the truth underlying the dense web of misinformation but must fully understand the psychological aspects as well to be able to efficiently counsel about the potential benefits and harms. Such knowledge is pivotal to help the lay public to make informed decisions about SARS CoV-2 in general and vaccination in particular; as the COVID-19 situation can probably be best controlled with mass inoculation and novel immune therapies. The lessons learnt regarding the importance of efficient communication and the adherence to the proven epidemiological measures hopefully would be leaving us better prepared for the future if challenged by novel communicable diseases of pandemic potential.","Xantus, Gabor Zoltan; Burke, Derek; Kanizsai, Peter",Postgraduate medical journal,https://doi.org/10.1136/postgradmedj-2021-139835; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33837130/,475

However, the mechanism by which B cell depletion mediates its beneficial effects in MS is still unclear. To better understand how B cell depletion may benefit patients with a disease previously thought to be primarily mediated by CD4 T cells, immune profiles were monitored in 48 patients in a phase II trial of ublituximab, a glycoengineered CD20 monoclonal antibody, at 18 time points over a year. As we previously described there was a significant shift in the percentages of T cells, NK cells, and myeloid cells following the initial dose of ublituximab, but this shift normalized within a week and these populations remained stable for the duration of the study. However, T cell subsets changed with an increase in the percentage of naïve CD4 and CD8 T cells and a decline in memory T cells. Importantly, the percentage of Th1 and CD4+GM-CSF+ T cells decreased, while the percentage of Tregs continued to increase over the year. Ublituximab not only depleted CD20+ B cells, but also CD20+ T cells. The favorable changes in the T cell subsets may contribute to the beneficial effects of B cell depletion therapy.","Lovett-Racke, Amy E; Yang, Yuhong; Liu, Yue; Gormley, Matthew; Kraus, Emma; Graham, Calsey; Wray, Sibyl; Racke, Michael K; Alvarez, Enrique; Bass, Ann; Fox, Edward",Journal of neuroimmunology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jneuroim.2021.577676; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34364105/,475

148450,Seeing beyond 2020: what next for refractive error care?,2021-04-07,"Interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) are restriction factors that inhibit the infectious entry of many enveloped RNA viruses. However, we demonstrated previously that human IFITM2 and IFITM3 are essential host factors facilitating the entry of human coronavirus (HCoV) OC43. In a continuing effort to decipher the molecular mechanism underlying IFITM differential modulation of HCoV entry, we investigated the roles of structural motifs important for IFITM protein posttranslational modifications, intracellular trafficking, and oligomerization in modulating the entry of five HCoVs. We found that three distinct mutations in IFITM1 or IFITM3 converted the host restriction factors to enhance entry driven by the spike proteins of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and/or Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). First, replacement of IFITM3 tyrosine 20 with either alanine or aspartic acid to mimic unphosphorylated or phosphorylated IFITM3 reduced its activity to inhibit the entry of HCoV-NL63 and -229E but enhanced the entry of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Second, replacement of IFITM3 tyrosine 99 with either alanine or aspartic acid reduced its activity to inhibit the entry of HCoV-NL63 and SARS-CoV but promoted the entry of MERS-CoV. Third, deletion of the carboxyl-terminal 12 amino acid residues from IFITM1 enhanced the entry of MERS-CoV and HCoV-OC43. These findings suggest that these residues and structural motifs of IFITM proteins are key determinants for modulating the entry of HCoVs, most likely through interaction with viral and/or host cellular components at the site of viral entry to modulate the fusion of viral envelope and cellular membranes.IMPORTANCE The differential effects of IFITM proteins on the entry of HCoVs that utilize divergent entry pathways and membrane fusion mechanisms even when using the same receptor make the HCoVs a valuable system for comparative investigation of the molecular mechanisms underlying IFITM restriction or promotion of virus entry into host cells. Identification of three distinct mutations that converted IFITM1 or IFITM3 from inhibitors to enhancers of MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV spike protein-mediated entry revealed key structural motifs or residues determining the biological activities of IFITM proteins. These findings have thus paved the way for further identification of viral and host factors that interact with those structural motifs of IFITM proteins to differentially modulate the infectious entry of HCoVs.","Zhao, Xuesen; Sehgal, Mohit; Hou, Zhifei; Cheng, Junjun; Shu, Sainan; Wu, Shuo; Guo, Fang; Le Marchand, Sylvain J; Lin, Hanxin; Chang, Jinhong; Guo, Ju-Tao",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01535-17; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29263263/,475

DESIGN Cohort study with information from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway and the Cerebral Palsy Registry of Norway. SETTING Births in Norway. PARTICIPANTS 294 598 women with their first and second singleton delivery during 1996-2015. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Stillbirth, perinatal mortality, neonatal mortality and cerebral palsy. RESULTS Among 294 598 included women, 42 962 (15%) had a CD in their first pregnancy while 251 636 (85%) had a VD. Compared with the second delivery of mothers with a previous VD, the adjusted OR (adjOR), for stillbirth in the second pregnancy following a previous CD was 1.45, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.73; for perinatal death the adjOR was 1.42 (1.22 to 1.73) and for neonatal death 1.13 (0.86 to 1.49). Among children who survived the neonatal period, the adjOR for cerebral palsy was 1.27 (0.99 to 1.64). Secondary outcomes, including small for gestational age, preterm and very preterm birth, uterine rupture and placental complications (eg, postpartum haemorrhage and pre-eclampsia) were more frequent in the subsequent pregnancy following a previous CD compared with a previous VD, in particular for uterine rupture adjOR 86.7 (48.2 to 156.1). Adjustment for potential confounders attenuated the ORs somewhat, but the excess risk in the second pregnancy persisted for all outcomes. CONCLUSION A previous CD was in this study associated with increased risk for stillbirth and perinatal death compared with a previous VD. Although less robust, we also found that a previous CD was associated with a slightly increased risk of cerebral palsy among children surviving the neonatal period. The aetiology behind these associations needs further investigation.","Bjellmo, Solveig; Andersen, Guro L; Hjelle, Sissel; Klungsøyr, Kari; Krebs, Lone; Lydersen, Stian; Romundstad, Pål Richard; Vik, Torstein",BMJ open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-037717; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32830116/,475

Antibodies could enhance specificity; therefore, procedures were developed for radiolabeling a small ( approximately 1451 Da) hapten peptide with (68)Ga or (18)F to compare their specificity with (18)F-FDG for detecting tumors using a pretargeting procedure. Mice were implanted with carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA; CEACAM5)-expressing LS174T human colonic tumors and a CEA-negative tumor, or an inflammation was induced in thigh muscle. A bispecific monoclonal anti-CEA x anti-hapten antibody was given to mice, and 16 hours later, 5 MBq of (68)Ga- or (18)F-labeled hapten peptides were administered intravenously. Within 1 hour, tissues showed high and specific targeting of (68)Ga-IMP-288, with 10.7 +/- 3.6% ID/g uptake in the tumor and very low uptake in normal tissues (e.g., tumor-to-blood ratio of 69.9 +/- 32.3), in a CEA-negative tumor (0.35 +/- 0.35% ID/g), and inflamed muscle (0.72 +/- 0.20% ID/g). (18)F-FDG localized efficiently in the tumor (7.42 +/- 0.20% ID/g) but also in the inflamed muscle (4.07 +/- 1.13% ID/g) and in several normal tissues; thus, pretargeted (68)Ga-IMP-288 provided better specificity and sensitivity. Positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography images reinforced the improved specificity of the pretargeting method. (18)F-labeled IMP-449 distributed similarly in the tumor and normal tissues as the (68)Ga-labeled IMP-288, indicating that either radiolabeled hapten peptide could be used. Thus, pretargeted immuno-PET does exceptionally well with short-lived radionuclides and is a highly sensitive procedure that is more specific than (18)F-FDG-PET. Mol Cancer Ther; 9(4); 1019-27.

We determined that DENV-2 promoted the cytoplasmic translocation of hnRNP K and to a lesser extent of hnRNP A2, meanwhile, JUNV infection induced an increase in hnRNP K cytoplasmic localization whereas hnRNP A2 remained mainly in the nucleus of infected cells. Both hnRNP K and hnRNP A2 were localized predominantly in the nucleus of JUNV persistently-infected cells even after superinfection with JUNV indicating that persistent infection does not alter nucleo-cytoplasmic transport of these hnRNPs. Total levels of hnRNP K expression were unaffected by DENV-2 or JUNV infection. In addition we determined, using small interfering RNAs, that hnRNP K knockout inhibits DENV-2 and JUNV multiplication. Our results indicate that DENV-2 and JUNV induce hnRNP K cytoplasmic translocation to favor viral multiplication.","Brunetti, Jesús E; Scolaro, Luis A; Castilla, Viviana",Virus research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2015.04.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25865411/,475

Hypercoagulability, thrombosis and hyperinflammation occur in COVID-19 and may contribute to severe complications. Therapeutic anticoagulation may improve clinical outcomes through anti-thrombotic, anti-inflammatory and anti-viral mechanisms. Our primary objective is to evaluate whether therapeutic-dose anticoagulation with low-molecular-weight heparin or unfractionated heparin prevents mechanical ventilation and/or death in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 compared to usual care. METHODS An international, open-label, adaptive randomized controlled trial. Using a Bayesian framework, the trial will declare results as soon as pre-specified posterior probabilities for superiority, futility, or harm are reached. The trial uses response-adaptive randomization to maximize the probability that patients will receive the more beneficial treatment approach, as treatment effect information accumulates within the trial. By leveraging a common data safety monitoring board and pooling data with a second similar international Bayesian adaptive trial (REMAP-COVID anticoagulation domain), treatment efficacy and safety will be evaluated as efficiently as possible. The primary outcome is an ordinal endpoint with three possible outcomes based on the worst status of each patient through day 30: no requirement for invasive mechanical ventilation, invasive mechanical ventilation or death. CONCLUSION Using an adaptive trial design, the Anti-Thrombotic Therapy To Ameliorate Complications of COVID-19 trial will establish whether therapeutic anticoagulation can reduce mortality and/or avoid the need for mechanical ventilation in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Leveraging existing networks to recruit sites will increase enrollment and mitigate enrollment risk in sites with declining COVID-19 cases.","Houston, Brett L; Lawler, Patrick R; Goligher, Ewan C; Farkouh, Michael E; Bradbury, Charlotte; Carrier, Marc; Dzavik, Vlad; Fergusson, Dean A; Fowler, Robert A; Galanaud, Jean-Phillippe; Gross, Peter L; McDonald, Emily G; Husain, Mansoor; Kahn, Susan R; Kumar, Anand; Marshall, John; Murthy, Srinivas; Slutsky, Arthur S; Turgeon, Alexis F; Berry, Scott M; Rosenson, Robert S; Escobedo, Jorge; Nicolau, Jose C; Bond, Lindsay; Kirwan, Bridget-Anne; de Brouwer, Sophie; Zarychanski, Ryan",Clinical trials,https://doi.org/10.1177/1740774520943846; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32815416/,475
151396,What Trump's Supreme Court pick could mean for science.,2020-09-28,"BACKGROUND Clinical examination alone is neither sensitive nor specific for predicting flap necrosis, so several technologies, including indocyanine green angiography, thermal imaging (using the FLIR ONE), and near-infrared spectroscopy, have been developed to supplement perfusion assessment. This study aims to compare the accuracy of these three methods for intraoperatively predicting clinical flap necrosis in a rat perforator flap model. The authors hypothesized that near-infrared spectroscopy, assessing oxygenation rather than direct perfusion, would yield significantly different predictions. METHODS A 10 × 3-cm epigastric perforator flap was elevated in 14 adult male rats weighing 250 ± 50 g. Flap perfusion was assessed immediately after flap elevation using thermal imaging, near-infrared spectroscopy, and indocyanine green angiography. Measurements were correlated to the clinical endpoint and gold standard of flap necrosis on postoperative day 7. RESULTS All three technologies detected significant differences in perfusion along flap length (all p < 0.001), and were associated with significant differences in the odds of developing flap necrosis (all p < 0.001). The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves were 0.948 for indocyanine green angiography as an absolute value, 0.873 for relative changes with thermal imaging, and 0.792 for tissue oxygenation. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for indocyanine green angiography measured as an absolute value were the highest at 97.8, 87.5, and 92 percent, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Indocyanine green angiography most accurately predicted flap necrosis in this study; however, tissue oximetry and thermal imaging were also capable of predicting necrosis and represented potentially less expensive or more readily available alternatives for objective perfusion assessment. Additional research can further delineate their roles and cost-efficacy in clinical practice.","Han, Tinglu; Khavanin, Nima; Wu, Jinlin; Zang, Mengqing; Zhu, Shan; Chen, Bo; Li, Shanshan; Liu, Yuanbo; Sacks, Justin M",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/prs.0000000000007278; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33141531/,475

RECENT FINDINGS Initially, three randomised trials failed to show superiority of PFO closure over antithrombotic therapy in patients with cryptogenic stroke. Three recently performed trials and the prolongation of an earlier trial provided evidence that PFO closure in patients with cryptogenic stroke and an age range of 18-60 years is superior to stroke prevention with antiplatelet therapy. PFO closure was not superior to anticoagulation. Anticoagulation, however, has a higher long-term bleeding risk. PFO closure could result in atrial fibrillation (AF) in a small number of patients. In most patients, AF was transient in duration. Optimal patient selection requires future research. In patients with cryptogenic stroke aged < 60 years, PFO closure is superior to antiplatelet therapy in the prevention of recurrent stroke.","Diener, Hans-Christoph; Gerloff, Christian; Thaler, David E; Wöhrle, Jochen",Current neurology and neuroscience reports,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11910-018-0910-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30328522/,475
152823,Coping with COVID.,2021-01-06,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Acute statin therapy improves neurologic outcome and diminishes infarct growth in animal models of stroke. Clinical studies suggest that premorbid and early statin use is associated with improved outcome after major stroke. We studied the association between statin therapy and radiographic and clinical outcomes in patients with high-risk TIA and minor stroke. MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients with high-risk TIA and minor stroke (NIHSS ≤3) were prospectively enrolled within 24 hours of symptom onset. Patients were followed clinically for 3 months, and a subset had a repeat MR imaging at 90 days. RESULTS Of 418 patients, 23% were prescribed statins before their stroke. Statins were continued in 20% and initiated in 42%. Patients on prior statin therapy were older and more hypertensive, treated with aspirin, and more likely to have symptomatic carotid disease compared with those not on statin. Adjusting for these differences, prior statin treatment was not associated with DWI positivity (adjusted OR = 1.3; 95% CI, 0.77-2.1; P = .32) or smaller median baseline infarct volume, 1.1 mL (interquartile range = 4) versus 1 mL (interquartile range = 2.5; P = .56). Early or continued treatment with statins did not improve the risk of clinical deterioration (adjusted OR = 0.66; 95% CI, 0.27-1.6; P = .35) or poor functional outcome at 3 months (adjusted OR = 0.66; 95% CI, 0.35-1.24; P = .19). CONCLUSIONS Prestroke or early-stroke statin therapy was not associated with a reduction in the number of DWI lesions, infarct volume, or improved clinical or functional outcome at 3 months. The effect of acute statin treatment in patients with ischemic stroke/TIA remains unclear and needs further investigation.","Asdaghi, N; Coulter, J I; Modi, J; Camden, M C; Qazi, A; Goyal, M; Rundek, T; Coutts, S B",AJNR.

With respect to dermatology, vehicle emissions by patients traveling to and from appointments are an important factor influencing climate change. This study was undertaken to determine the greenhouse gas emissions avoided by managing isotretinoin virtually at West Virginia University Hospital. METHODS A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted during the COVID-19 outbreak from March 25 to December 1, 2020, where travel data were acquired and converted to emission data. RESULTS 5,137 kg of GHG emissions in CO2 equivalents were prevented by managing isotretinoin virtually during the study period. 49 400 kg of GHG emissions in CO2 equivalents would be prevented annually. This is the emission load released when 24 690 kg of coal are burned. CONCLUSIONS Environmental impact studies in the field of dermatology remain limited. GHG emissions were significantly reduced by virtually managing isotretinoin at a single institution. The practice of dermatology could reduce its carbon footprint by managing isotretinoin virtually, even in non-pandemic periods. Given that isotretinoin management represents a small percentage of the overall carbon footprint associated with dermatology, dermatologists should identify other conditions amenable to virtual medicine to produce greater environmental impact.","Lee, Justin; Yousaf, Ahmed; Jenkins, Samantha; Zaki, Mohammed Tamim; Napier, Cecelia; Abdul-Aziz, Omar I; Zinn, Zachary",Pediatric dermatology,https://doi.org/10.1111/pde.14600; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33870555/,475

The objective of this systematic review was to identify clinical and laboratory features that differentiate dengue fever (DF) and/or dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) from other febrile illnesses (OFI) in dengue-endemic populations. METHOD Systematic review of the literature from 1990 to 30 October 2007 including English publications comparing dengue and OFI. RESULTS Among 49 studies reviewed, 34 did not meet our criteria for inclusion. Of the 15 studies included, 10 were prospective cohort studies and five were case-control studies. Seven studies assessed all ages, four assessed children only, and four assessed adults only. Patients with dengue had significantly lower platelet, white blood cell (WBC) and neutrophil counts, and a higher frequency of petechiae than OFI patients. Higher frequencies of myalgia, rash, haemorrhagic signs, lethargy/prostration, and arthralgia/joint pain and higher haematocrits were reported in adult patients with dengue but not in children. Most multivariable models included platelet count, WBC, rash, and signs of liver damage; however, none had high statistical validity and none considered changes in clinical features over the course of illness. CONCLUSIONS Several individual clinical and laboratory variables distinguish dengue from OFI; however, some variables may be dependent on age. No published multivariable model has been validated.

BACKGROUND The RYGB resolves T2DM in a high proportion of patients and is considered the standard operation for T2DM resolution in morbidly obese patients. However, no data exist comparing the efficacy of medical management and other bariatric operations to the RYGB for treatment of T2DM in comparable patient populations. METHODS We performed a retrospective case-matched study of morbidly obese patients with T2DM who had undergone medical management (nonsurgical controls [NSC]; N = 29), LAGB (N = 30), or DS (N = 27) and were compared with matched T2DM patients who had undergone RYGB. Matching was performed with respect to age, sex, body mass index, and hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C). Outcomes assessed were changes in body mass index, HbA1C, and diabetes medication scores at 1 year. RESULTS The Roux-en-Y gastric bypass produced greater weight loss, HbA1C normalization, and medication score reduction compared to both NSC and LAGB-matched cohorts. Duodenal switch produced greater reductions in HbA1C and medication score than RYGB, despite no greater weight loss at 1 year. Surgical complications were rarely life threatening. CONCLUSIONS This study provides an important perspective about the comparative efficacy of LAGB, DS, and NSC to the RYGB for treatment of T2DM among obese patients. After 1 year of follow-up, RYGB is superior to NSC and LAGB with respect to weight loss and improvement in diabetes whereas DS is superior to RYGB in reducing HbA1C and medication score.","Dorman, Robert B; Serrot, Federico J; Miller, Christopher J; Slusarek, Bridget M; Sampson, Barbara K; Buchwald, Henry; Leslie, Daniel B; Bantle, John P; Ikramuddin, Sayeed",Annals of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/sla.0b013e318232b033; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21975321/,475

However, the prosthesis is not without complications, including scapular notching, instability, and limited rotational motion. Implants have been modified from the original design in an effort to reduce the risk of these complications. Increasing the offset, or lateralization, of the glenosphere may reduce the rate of scapular notching, reduce impingement, increase stability, and improve rotational motion. However, a more lateralized glenosphere could lead to baseplate loosening, decreased deltoid efficiency, and increased risk of acromial fracture. Increasing the offset on the humeral side, rather than the glenosphere side, may be able to reduce the rate of scapular notching and improve rotational motion without an increased risk of baseplate loosening. Humeral lateralization also improves tension of the rotator cuff and maintains good deltoid efficiency. However, humeral lateralization provides little stability benefit, and acromial fracture remains a risk. Ultimately, the surgeon must be familiar with the implants he or she is using and the options for both glenosphere and humeral lateralization to ensure that risks and benefits can be weighed for each patient.","Wright, Melissa A; Murthi, Anand M",The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.5435/jaaos-d-20-00671; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33264136/,475
161715,Effects of Leachates from UV-Weathered Microplastic in Cell-Based Bioassays.,2019,"Dihydroorotate:quinone oxidoreductases (DHOQOs) are membrane bound enzymes responsible for oxidizing dihydroorotate (DHO) to orotate with concomitant reduction of quinone to quinol. They have FMN as prosthetic group and are part of the monotopic quinone reductase superfamily. These enzymes are also members of the dihydroorotate dehydrogenases (DHODHs) family, which besides membrane bound DHOQOs, class 2, includes soluble enzymes which reduce either NAD+ or fumarate, class 1. As key enzymes in both the de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway as well as in the energetic metabolism, inhibitors of DHOQOs have been investigated as leads for therapeutics in cancer, immunological disorders and bacterial/viral infections. This work is a thorough bioinformatic approach on the structural conservation and taxonomic distribution of DHOQOs. We explored previously established structural/functional hallmarks of these enzymes, while searching for uncharacterized common elements. We also discuss the cellular role of DHOQOs and organize the identified protein sequences within six sub-classes 2A to 2F, according to their taxonomic origin and sequence traits. We concluded that DHOQOs are present in Archaea, Eukarya and Bacteria, including the first recognition in Gram-positive organisms. DHOQOs can be the single dihydroorotate dehydrogenase encoded in the genome of a species, or they can coexist with other DHODHs, as the NAD+ or fumarate reducing enzymes. Furthermore, we show that the type of catalytic base present in the active site is not an absolute criterium to distinguish between class 1 and class 2 enzymes. We propose the existence of a quinone binding motif (""ExAH"") adjacent to a hydrophobic cavity present in the membrane interacting N-terminal domain.","Sousa, Filipe M; Refojo, Patricia N; Pereira, Manuela M",Biochimica et biophysica acta.

Two lessons were designed and tested in two secondary classes (15- to 16-year-old students), using a lesson study approach. Three students from each class were observed more closely when visualizing and reasoning about two complex biological problems. The results, based on student worksheets, peer discussions, classroom observations, and interviews, indicated that students were able to visualize complex problems with the aid of a systems model based on eight system characteristics: boundary, components, interactions, input and output, feedback, hierarchy, dynamics, and emergence. Moreover, explicit scaffolds encouraged students to reason across different levels of biological organization. Based on the findings, four design guidelines were formulated: 1) Start with a central complex problem/question. 2) Let students visualize a complex biological problem using a systems model. 3) Assist students in reasoning step by step within and between the levels of biological organization. 4) Make students explicitly aware of the use of the system characteristics in various contexts. As systems thinking assists students in creating an overview of a system and reasoning about a complex problem systematically, it is also valuable outside the biology classroom.","Gilissen, Melde G R; Knippels, Marie-Christine P J; van Joolingen, Wouter R",CBE life sciences education,https://doi.org/10.1187/cbe.20-05-0088; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34180712/,475

We compared the clinical outcome (3-month modified Rankin Scale, mRS) in hyperacute (<3h from the onset of symptoms) ischemic stroke between an MT and an intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) cohort in proximal (ICA and the proximal M1 segment of the middle cerebral artery) and distal (the distal M1 and the M2 segment) LVOs. Methods We prospectively reviewed 67 patients who underwent MT with newer-generation stent retrievers. The IVT cohort consisted of 98 patients who received IVT without MT. We recorded baseline clinical, procedural and imaging variables, technical outcome, 24-h imaging outcome, and the clinical outcome. Differences between the groups were studied with theoretically appropriate statistical tests and binary logistic regression analysis. Results The proportion of patients who had a proximal LVO and experienced good (mRS ≤2) or excellent (mRS ≤1) clinical outcome was significantly larger in the MT group (62 vs. 7%, p < 0.001; 47 vs. 3%, p < 0.001, respectively). In a regression model including relevant confounding variables, good clinical outcome was seen significantly more often among patients with proximal occlusions (OR = 6.0, CI 95% 1.9-18.3, p = 0.002). In a similar model, no statistically significant differences were observed in patients with more distal occlusions. Conclusions MT is superior to IVT in achieving good clinical outcome in hyperacute anterior circulation stroke in the most proximal occlusions (ICA and proximal M1 segment). In the distal M1 and M2 segments neither of these therapies clearly outperforms the other.","Sillanpää, Niko; Protto, Sara; Saarinen, Jukka T; Pienimäki, Juha-Pekka; Seppänen, Janne; Numminen, Heikki; Rusanen, Harri",Interventional neurology,https://doi.org/10.1159/000475606; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29118798/,475

The goal of this quantitative study was to examine associations between adolescents' attachment to parents and peers, their participation in sports before and during the confinement, and the severity of their psychological distress. A total of 133 adolescents between the ages of 11 and 17 took part in an online survey including the Inventory of Parent and Peer Attachment, the Psychological Distress Index, and questions regarding their involvement in physical activity before and during confinement. Overall, findings highlight participants' high levels of total psychological distress, with girls reporting more severe symptoms. However, results of correlational analyses showed that adolescents reporting greater attachment security to parents and peers showed fewer symptoms of total distress as well as fewer symptoms of depression, anxiety, and irritability. Participation in organized sports prior to confinement and time devoted to physical or sports activities in the last week were not significantly correlated with the Psychological Distress Index subscales. However, results of hierarchical regression analyses revealed that youth participation in sports prior to confinement moderated the association between time devoted by adolescents to physical or sports activities in the last week and symptoms of depression, above and beyond the influence of attachment security to parents and peers. The importance of quality relationships and physical activity for youth adaptation during confinement is discussed.

164122,Deep learning-based real-time detection of novel pathogens during sequencing,2021-06-09,"COVID-19, a novel coronavirus infectious disease, has spread around the world, resulting in a large number of deaths. Due to a lack of physicians, emergency facilities, and equipment, medical systems have been unable to treat all patients in many countries. Deep learning is a promising approach for providing solutions to COVID-19 based on patients’ medical images. As COVID-19 is a new disease, its related dataset is still being collected and published. Small COVID-19 datasets may not be sufficient to build powerful deep learning detection models. Such models are often over-fitted, and their prediction results cannot be generalized. To fill this gap, we propose a deep learning approach for accurately detecting COVID-19 cases based on chest X-ray (CXR) images. For the proposed approach, named COVID-CGAN, we first generated a larger dataset using generative adversarial networks (GANs). Specifically, a customized conditional GAN (CGAN) was designed to generate the target COVID-19 CXR images. The expanded dataset, which contains 84.8% generated images and 15.2% original images, was then used for training five deep detection models: InceptionResNetV2, Xception, SqueezeNet, VGG16, and AlexNet. The results show that the use of the synthetic CXR images, which were generated by the customized CGAN, helped all deep learning models to achieve high detection accuracies. In particular, the highest accuracy was achieved by the InceptionResNetV2 model, which was 99.72% accurate with only ten epochs. All five models achieved kappa coefficients between 0.81 and 1, which is interpreted as an almost perfect agreement between the actual labels and the detected labels. Furthermore, the experiment showed that some models were faster yet smaller compared to the others but could still achieve high accuracy. For instance, SqueezeNet, which is a small network, required only three minutes and achieved comparable accuracy to larger networks such as InceptionResNetV2, which needed about 143 min. Our proposed approach can be applied to other fields with scarce datasets.","Al-Shargabi, Amal A.; Alshobaili, Jowharah F.; Alabdulatif, Abdulatif Alrobah Naseem",Applied Sciences,https://doi.org/10.3390/app11167174,475

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based diagnostic tests use purifi ed nucleic acids (NAs) from clinical samples. The NAs purifi cation step adds time, cost, and aff ects the quality of testing. The objective of this study was to develop a protocol for direct use of saliva in tests for genetic markers, without purifi cation of nucleic acids. Methods. PCR, real-time RT-PCR and isothermal amplifi cation tests were used for direct detection of genetic markers, without purifi cation of nucleic acids. Results. We report a protocol for the direct detection of genetic markers in saliva. The protocol is based on a collection of saliva in a solution containing a detergent and ethanol and is compatible with isothermal amplifi cation (LAMP), real-time RT-PCR and RT-PCR. SARS-CoV-2 and GAPDH markers were used as reference markers. We observed that mild detergents allow effi cient detection of external reference and intracellular endogenous markers, while strong detergent, e.g. sodium dodecyl sulfate, inhibited the PCR reaction. Under these conditions, saliva samples can be stored for 24 h at +4°C or -18°C with the preservation of markers. Storage at room temperature led to the deterioration of marker detection. Snap heating of saliva samples at the time of collection, followed by storage at room temperature, provided partial protection. Conclusion. The protocol presented in this report describes the collection and storage of saliva for direct detection of genetic markers and is compatible with PCR and LAMP tests. © 2021 Croatian Veterinary Institute.

The surveyed students, were exposed to differently structured online courses from different institutes, as well as dynamic developments in each online course, over the semester and thus were able to effectively assess the pros and cons of the different teaching styles. To get the viewpoints of both the involved parties on how a successful online education course needs to be structured, a similar survey was also conducted among manufacturing engineering professors involved in Germany. The survey, a combination of Likert-scale and free-text questions, tackled the aspects of motivation to teach and learn, ensuring effective teaching and learning, and proper assessment of the learning outcomes in an online education system. The results show that both parties initially struggled with the transition, but later adapted quickly to the new style of online teaching that was inspired by the conventional flipped classroom concept. Certain structures and approaches to online teaching, such as pre-recorded lectures;interactive Q&A sessions;quizzes for self-assessment, are preferred by students and teachers alike. Aspects where the viewpoints differed could be explained by the difference in age and the experience in using digital equipment.

During the COVID-19 pandemic variety of digital tools and technologies were demonstrated owing to the global digitalization of education and the total transition to online learning. The purpose of present research is to determine factors of digitalization of education and their effect on transformation of social values among high school students in conditions of the COVID-19. The results of research on social values of students were considered using comparative analysis. It was revealed that the paradigm of values among young people changed from an individual-personal one at the beginning of the XXI century to the social oriented paradigm - tolerance, openness, public recognition through social networks, self-development and contribution to the community. Materials and Methods. The analysis of pedagogical experience in the field of digitalization of education allowed to formulate the main factors of global digitalization of education and to highlight positive and negative aspects of online learning. According to M. Rokich's method, an empirical study of instrumental values transformations was carried out among 137 students of Ural Federal University in the conditions of full-time online learning. A questionnaire method was implemented to determine students' attitude to online learning during COVID-19 pandemic and possibility for further development of this form of learning. Results. It was revealed that only 13.7% of respondents did not notice any decrease in the quality of learning and did not experience discomfort in obtaining knowledge in online form. According to the students' opinion the values that are subjected to transformation are the following: efficiency, self-control, responsibility, honesty. It can be concluded that the era of network personality and new scientific knowledge in pedagogy has begun. Online learning is a fait accompli which requires scientific substantiation of a new didactics and social values system development among students in a digital education environment. Discussion and Conclusion. Achieved results contribute to ecological system of new digital services that change life and educational activities of a human, as well as transform his personality and values system. Thus, for the purpose of health and emotional intelligence preservation in students the continuation of interdisciplinary study of various aspects of education digitalization is required. © Rezer T.

We built a clinically annotated, biologically-interpretable space for precise time-resolved disease monitoring and characterize the temporal dynamics of metabolomic change along the clinical course of COVID-19 patients and in response to therapy. Finally, we leverage joint immuno-metabolic measurements to provide a novel approach for patient stratification and early prediction of severe disease. Our results show that high-dimensional metabolomic and joint immune-metabolic readouts provide rich information content for elucidation of the host response to infection and empower discovery of novel metabolic-driven therapies, as well as precise and efficient clinical action.","Rendeiro, A.

Objectives: To determine the association between occupational asbestos exposure and IPF; to investigate interaction with MUC5B rs35705950 genotype. Methods: Multi-centre, incident case-control study. Cases (n=494) were men diagnosed with IPF at 21 United Kingdom hospitals. Controls (n=466) were age-matched men who attended a hospital clinic in the same period. Asbestos exposure was measured using a validated job exposure matrix and a source-receptor model. The primary outcome was the association between asbestos exposure and IPF, estimated using logistic regression adjusted for age, smoking and centre. Interaction with MUC5B rs3570950 was investigated using a genetic dominant model. Measurements and Main Results: 327 (66%) cases and 293 (63%) controls ever had a high or medium asbestos exposure risk job; 8% of both cases and controls, had cumulative exposure estimates [≥] 25 fibre/ml.years. Occupational asbestos exposure was not associated with IPF, adjusted OR 1.1(95%CI 0.8-1.4; p=0.6) and there was no gene-environment interaction (p=0.2). Ever smoking was associated with IPF, OR 1.4 (95%CI 1-1.9; p=0.04). When stratifying for genotype there was significant interaction between smoking and work in an exposed job (p<0.01) for carriers of the minor allele of MUC5B rs3570950. Conclusions: Occupational asbestos exposure alone, or through interaction with MUC5B rs35705950 genotype, was not associated with IPF. However, exposure to asbestos and smoking interact to increase IPF risk in carriers of the minor allele of MUC5B rs3570950.

Liposome encapsulated catechol was used for LLO detection via LLO pore-forming ability. hly gene was specifically captured by using a thiolated capture probe on nanoporous gold (NPG). As an electroactive label, methylene blue was embedded in double-stranded structures to generate an electrochemical signal for hly detection. Combined with the electrocatalysis of NADH by NPG, the acetoin detection was achieved by measuring the consumption of NADH as a cofactor under acetoin reductase catalysis. Importantly, the L. monocytogenes detection results obtained by detecting three biomarkers using the chip can be mutually verified, which reduces the probability of false positives based on a single marker. Moreover, the detection time was reduced to about 90 min, making it a rapid and reliable tool for L. monocytogenes detection.","Zhang, Yachao; Wang, Huimin; Xiao, Sa; Wang, Xia; Xu, Ping",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.22.348615,475

171032,Development of Air Conditioner Robot Prototype That Follows Humans in Outdoor Applications,2021,"About 50 kinase inhibitors have been approved by the FDA for different indications so far. On the way from target validation to approval, the biochemical characterisation of a novel kinase inhibitor is a challenging, yet absolutely critical task. High resolution, kinetic molecular profiling can enable better data-driven decision making early on in the drug discovery process, not only saving time and resources, but also leading to superior molecular design. Arctoris developed a robotics-enabled process for fully automated kinase inhibitor characterisation, providing an unparalleled depth of data capture, going beyond the current state-of-the-art of biochemical assay setup. We validated our technology platform establishing assays against four members of the Janus Kinase family (JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, TYK2), profiling a set of JAK inhibitors. Of note, several JAK inhibitors with prior FDA approval for other indications entered clinical trials for COVID-19 treatment, making this target class particularly relevant for an in-depth study. Reagent validation, assay development, calibration, and optimization were expedited through systematic multifactorial experimental design, high density assay plate formats and versatile automated liquid handling. The Arctoris Ulysses platform affords 9 orders of magnitude range in liquid volume handling, with picolitre precision and contact-free digital dispensing for true, non-serial, independent experimentation. Fully automated protocols were optimized, validated, versioned, and explicitly encoded. Robust potency measurements of all inhibitors were established against each of the JAK targets, revealing molecules with distinct isoform selectivity. Designing and selecting molecules with specific activity profiles enables the fine tuning of pharmacology and the avoidance of unwanted off-target toxicity. Our unique platform, assay design, and deep expertise enabled the identification of molecules within the JAK inhibitor set that exhibit a range of kinetic properties. Our mechanistic analyses can help to elucidate the mode of inhibition (competitive, allosteric, synergistic etc.) as well as provide information pertaining to the kinetic selectivity that may be present but missed by focusing solely on potency.","Thomas, D.

Yet experimental work in the binary case has shown magnitude sensitive reaction times, and theory shows that this can be explained by switching from linear to geometric time costs, but also by nonlinear subjective utility. Thus disentangling explanations for observed magnitude sensitive reaction times is difficult. Here for the first time we extend the theoretical analysis of geometric time-discounting to ternary choices, and present novel experimental evidence for magnitude-sensitivity in such decisions, in both humans and slime moulds. We consider the optimal policies for all possible combinations of linear and geometric time costs, and linear and nonlinear utility; interestingly, geometric discounting emerges as the predominant explanation for magnitude sensitivity.","Marshall, James A.

However, its ability to conduct has hindered its engineering application. This study prepares a novel microencapsulated phase change material (MEPCM) by suspension polymerization. To improve the adhesion between the shell and the inorganic additive, triethoxyvinylsilane was incorporated copolymerizing with methyl methacrylate. Thermally conductive nanographite particle was added. This MEPCM was then incorporated into high-density polyethylene (HDPE) to form a series of thermally conductive PCM microcapsules that approached sphere shapes with diameters less than 2 μm. Thermal analysis showed that the thermal stability and heat resistance of the microcapsule were improved. The thermal conductivity of HDPE was increased by 39% to 0.6358 W/m ⋅K, and the surface resistivity was lowered to 2.78 × 105 Ω/sq after the addition of MEPCM. The temperature on the top of the composite tested was lower than pristine HDPE. This was close to the onset melting temperature of the MEPCM (38.5∘C), ∼5∘C lower than pure HDPE. The reduction is a significant improvement in temperature regulation. This enables MEPCMs to store and release heat much more effectively, and can thus be applied to medical construction materials to meet the temperature requirements of COVID-19 patients.

Here, we investigated the relationship between prevalence of Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn) and Fusobacteriales, CMS/CRIS subtyping, cell type composition, immune infiltrates and host contexture to refine patients stratification and identify druggable context-specific vulnerabilities. Design We coupled cell culture experiments with characterization of Fn/Fusobacteriales prevalence and host biology/microenviroment in tumours from 2 independent CRC patient cohorts (Taxonomy: n=140; TCGA-COAD-READ: n=605). Results In vitro, Fn infection induced inflammation via NFκB/TNFα in HCT116 and HT29 cancer cell lines. In patients, high Fn/Fusobacteriales were found in CMS1, MSI tumours, with infiltration of macrophages M1, reduced macrophages M2, and high IL6/IL8/IL1β signaling. Analysis of the Taxonomy cohort suggested that Fn was prognostic for CMS4/CRIS-B patients, despite having lower Fn load than CMS1 patients. In the TCGA-COAD-READ cohort, we likewise identified a differential association between Fusobacteriales relative abundance and outcome when stratifying patients in mesenchymal (either CMS4 and/or CRIS-B) vs. non-mesenchymal (neither CMS4 nor CRIS-B). Patients with mesenchymal tumours and high Fusobacteriales had approximately 2-fold higher risk of worse outcome. These associations were null in non-mesenchymal patients. Modelling the 3-way association between Fusobacteriales prevalence, molecular subtyping, and host contexture with logistic models with an interaction term disentangled the pathogen/host-signaling relationship and identified aberrations (including EMT/WNT/NOTCH) as candidate targets. Conclusion This study identifies CMS4/CRIS-B patients with high Fn/Fusobacteriales prevalence as a high-risk subpopulation that may benefit from therapeutics targeting mesenchymal biology. Significance of this study What is already known on this subject? Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn), a commensal Gram-negative anaerobe from the Fusobacteriales order, is an onco-bacterium in CRC as a causal relationship between Fn prevalence and CRC pathogenesis, progression and treatment response has been reported in vivo. Broad spectrum antibiotics has proven moderately successful in reducing tumour growth in preclinical models. However, the use of antibiotics to treat bacterium-positive cases in the clinic is not a viable option as it may further alter the already dysbiotic gut microbiome of CRC patients and may also have limited efficacy against Fn which penetrates and embeds deeply within the tumour. The highly heterogenous CRC patient population can be classified into distinct molecular subtypes (CMS and CRIS) based on gene expression profiles mirroring the underlying transcriptional programs. Patients classified as CMS4 and CRIS-B exhibit a mesenchymal phenotype and have poorer outcome. What are the new findings? Fn/Fusobacteriales prevalence is associated with immune involvement (decrease in macrophages M1 and increase in macrophages M2) and activation of specific signalling programs (inflammation, DNA damage, WNT, metastasis, proliferation, cell cycle) in the host tumours. The prevalence of bacteria from the Fusobacteriales order, largely driven by Fn species, play an active or opportunistic role depending on the underlying host tumour biology and microenvironment. Fn and other species of the Fusobacteriales order are enriched in CMS1 (immuno, microsatellite unstable) patients compared to CMS2-4 cases. Fn/Fusobacteriales prevalence is associated with worse clinical outcome in patients with mesenchymal-rich CMS4/CRIS-B tumours, but not in patients with other molecular subtypes. How might it impact on clinical practice in the foreseeable future? Fn/Fusobacteriales screening and transcriptomic-based molecular subtyping should be considered to identify patients with mesenchymal-rich tumours and high bacterium prevalence and to inform disease management. Fn/Fusobacteriales prevalence may need to be addressed exclusively in patients with mesenchymal-rich high-stromal infiltrating tumours rather than a blanket-approach to treat all pathogen-positive patients. Clinical management of the disease for this subpopulation of high-risk patients with unfavourable clinical outcome could be attained by administering compounds currently in clinical trials that target aberrations in the host signaling pathways (NOTCH, WNT, EMT) and tumour microenviroment (inflammasome, activated T cells, complement system, and macrophage chemotactism and activation).","Salvucci, Manuela; Crawford, Nyree; Stott, Katie; Bullman, Susan; Longley, Daniel B.; Prehn, Jochen H.M.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.17.444326,475

In this paper, this idea is investigated by applying a nonparametric model, namely, a local-linear kernel smoother with the aim of forecasting long-term stock returns where the model and smoothing parameters are chosen by cross-validation. While a wide range of predictive variables are examined, we find that our newly introduced debt-by-price ratio and the third to fourth quarter economic growth are robust predictors of stock returns, beating the well-known predictive variables in the literature by a significant difference. The combination of these two covariates can explain almost 30% variation of stock returns at a one-year horizon.

174176,MULTIMAP: Multilingual picture naming test for mapping eloquent areas during awake surgeries,2020-06-08,"The traditional long-term solutions for epidemic control involve eradication or herd immunity. Neither of them will be attained within a few months for the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we analytically derive the existence of a third, viable solution: a stable equilibrium at low case numbers, where test-trace-and-isolate policies partially compensate for local spreading events, and only moderate contact restrictions remain necessary. Across wide parameter ranges of our complementary compartmental model, the equilibrium is reached at or below 10 daily new cases per million people. Such low levels had been maintained over months in most European countries. However, this equilibrium is endangered (i) if contact restrictions are relaxed, or (ii) if case numbers grow too high. The latter destabilisation marks a novel tipping point beyond which the spread self-accelerates because test-trace-and-isolate capacities are overwhelmed. To reestablish control quickly, a lockdown is required. We show that a lockdown is either effective within a few weeks, or tends to fail its aim. If effective, recurring lockdowns are not necessary --- contrary to the oscillating dynamics previously presented in the context of circuit breakers, and contrary to a regime with high case numbers --- if moderate contact reductions are maintained. Hence, at low case numbers, the control is easier, and more freedom can be granted. We demonstrate that this strategy reduces case numbers and fatalities by a factor of 5 compared to a strategy focused only on avoiding major congestion of hospitals. Furthermore, our solution minimises lockdown duration, and hence economic impact. In the long term, control will successively become easier due to immunity through vaccination or large scale testing programmes. International coordination would facilitate even more the implementation of this solution.","Contreras, S.; Dehning, J.; Mohr, S. B.; Spitzner, F.

However, there is vaccine hesitancy at a greater rate among this group than in the wider community. We aimed to understand barriers and facilitators to getting the COVID-19 vaccine, as well as views on potential mandatory vaccination policies. Design: Semi-structured interviews. Setting: Care home employees in North West England. Interviews conducted in April 2021. Participants: 10 care home employees (aged 25 to 61 years old) in the North West, who had been invited to have, but had not yet received, the COVID-19 vaccine. Results: We analysed the interviews using a framework analysis. Our analysis identified eight themes: perceived risk of COVID-19, efficacy of the vaccine, concerns about the vaccine, mistrust in authorities, facilitators to getting the vaccine, views on potential mandatory COVID-19 vaccination policies, negative experiences of care work during the COVID-19 pandemic, and communication challenges. Conclusions: The care home employees interviewed at the time of this study reported a low perceived risk of COVID-19, alongside concerns over the efficacy of the vaccine, side effects, and speed of vaccine development, which is exacerbated by mistrust in authorities. Facilitators to getting the vaccine included wanting to protect others, perceived severity of COVID-19, and workplace norms. Making COVID-19 vaccination a condition of deployment may not result in increased willingness to get the COVID-19 vaccination, with most care home employees in this study favouring leaving their job rather than getting vaccinated. At a time when many of the workers already had negative experiences of care work during the pandemic due to perceived negative judgment from others and a perceived lack of support facing care home employees, policies that require vaccination as a condition of deployment were not positively received.","Dennis, A.; Robin, C.; Jones, L.; Carter, H.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.08.20.21262101v1?rss=1,475

This has continued to negatively affect the continents’ share of the global leisure tourism market despite the rich and unique natural touristic resources. The continents’ MICE tourism, however, has been on the growth path before COVID 19 pandemic. This study, therefore, investigated the influence of perceived destination image by international MICE visitors on their post-visit behaviour. The study was carried out in the Kenyan capital city, Nairobi. The study followed a convenience sampling method with a total sample of 335 respondents. A model on destination image and post-visit behaviour was developed and tested. A blindfolding procedure in PLS showed the model had predictive relevance. Findings indicated that the cognitive image dimension had a positive and significant influence on affective image, overall image, and post-visit behaviour.

176249,Anomaly detection methods in turning based on motor data analysis,2020-12-31,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has brought heightened attention to the importance of cleaning, sanitizing, and disinfecting in retail food and foodservice establishments. In response, major governmental agencies have emphasized the need to frequently disinfect high-touch surfaces. While this recommendation may seem straightfor-ward and achievable, it is far more nuanced and complex. In the retail food and foodservice industry, sanitization is a routine, common practice defined and recommended in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Food Code. Hence, sanitizers, rather than disinfectants, are the main antimicrobial products used in these settings. It is important to emphasize that sanitizers and disinfectants are not inter-changeable products, so they may be inadvertently misused. Therefore, end users need to understand the differences of when, why, and how both can be used in retail food and foodservice settings. The aim of this paper is to increase end users’ knowledge and awareness about the proper use of sanitizers and disinfectants in retail food and foodservice establishments. This paper is organized into six sections— Antimicrobial Products: Sanitizers and Disinfectants, FDA Food Code, Regulation of Sanitizers and Disinfectants, Understanding EPA-Registered Labels, Emerging Issues, and Current and Future Trends in Sanitizing and Disinfecting. When used properly, sanitizers and disinfectants are powerful tools that can keep retail food and foodservice operations safe from pathogens that cause infectious disease. © 2021, International Association for Food Protection.

The main objective of this paper is to present a review describing the most important approaches, and we monitor their performance under the same dataset. For this review, we focus on the three R-packages that can be used for this purpose, and the different models assessed are representative of the two most widespread methodologies used to analyze spatiotemporal count data: the classical approach and the Bayesian point of view. A COVID-19-related case study is analyzed as an illustration of these different methodologies. Because of the current urgent need for monitoring and predicting data in the COVID-19 pandemic, this case study is, in itself, of particular importance and can be considered the secondary objective of this work. Satisfactory and promising results have been obtained in this second goal. With respect to the main objective, it has been seen that, although the three models provide similar results in our case study, their different properties and flexibility allow us to choose the model depending on the application at hand.","Ibañez, Maria Victoria Martínez-Garcia Marina Simó Amelia",Mathematics,https://doi.org/10.3390/math9131538,475

178075,Experimental investigations into alumina ceramic micromachining by electrochemical discharge machining process,2020-12-31,"International agricultural policies to address hunger and malnutrition in the tropics and sub-tropics have typically been based on approaches to the intensification of farming systems effective in industrialised economies where the social, economic, and environmental conditions and the infrastructure are very different to those in Africa. The consequence of this short-sightedness has been that agricultural productivity, dependent on ecosystem services from natural capital, has declined in Africa due to ecological and environmental collapse. This has undermined the livelihoods of the millions of smallholder farmers living on the brink of the cash economy, leading to severe social injustice. This review summarises advances in smallholder agriculture’s sustainable intensification in the tropics and sub-tropics, leveraging the domestication and commercialisation of wild indigenous tree species that produce nutritious, marketable, and useful food and non-food products. These are grown within diversified and multifunctional farming systems together with conventional food staples and local orphan crops to reduce land degradation, pollution, water extraction, and nutrient mining while promoting services such as pollination and other ecological functions. The benefits arising from this approach simultaneously address hunger, malnutrition, poverty, social injustice, and a stagnant economy, as well as important global issues such as climate change, loss of biodiversity and environmental degradation. Addressing these issues may also reduce the risk of future pandemics of zoonotic diseases, such as COVID-19. This set of serious global issues epitomise our divided and dysfunctional world and calls out for action. Enhancing sustainable smallholder productivity using indigenous and wild foods is an important international policy and business intervention, vital for achieving the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals and the rebalancing of the global economy by restoring natural capital within new African indigenous food industries.","Leakey, Roger R.

A dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model, in which Turkey is defined as an open and small developing country, is built. The model contains eight groups of agents, which are two heterogeneous households, the firms producing intermediate, final and capital goods, the commercial bank, the central bank and the government. Stochastic simulations of the model reveal the propagation of Covid-19 shock, the impacts of fiscal and monetary tools on the selected economic variables. The simulations demonstrate that direct fiscal measures are more effective in mitigating negative economic impacts of Covid-19.

The aim of our study was to assess the incidence of COVID-19 infection among staff involved in surgical tracheostomy on COVID-19 patients Method: A surgical tracheostomy protocol and operation theatre modifications were put in place at our centre, dictated by local resources staff availability and previous tracheostomy experience. Between 26/ 03/2020 and 27/05/2020, staff participating in 71 tracheostomy procedures were sent a questionnaire. The presence of COVID-19 symptoms (new onset continuous cough, fever, loss of taste and/or loss of smell) in tracheostomy staff and patient related data were analysed Result: Among the responders (72/122), compliance with personal prophylaxis equipment use was 100%. Eleven (15%,11/72) reported key COVID-19 symptoms and self-isolated. 10 had a COVID-19 swab test and three tested positive. One staff attended (1/72) hospital for symptomatic treatment, none required hospitalisation. 43/72 staff (60%) underwent a COVID-19 antibody test, 18.6% (8/43) were positive Among the tracheostomised patients, the mean age was 58 years(29- 78) and 65.5% were males. The median time from intubation to ST was 15 days (range 5-33, IQR=9). There were no tracheostomy related deaths and overall mortality was 11%(6/55) Conclusion: Safe delivery of tracheostomy during a pandemic like COVID-19 is possible with strict adherence to personnel protective equipment, surgical protocols and regulation of traffic flow in theatres to mitigate the potential transmission of COVID-19 among surgical staff Take-home Message: Compliance with PPE, adherence to tracheostomy protocol and local modifications can mitigate potential COVID-19 transmission among health care personnel .","Angamuthu, N.; Baker, D.; Tsui, J.; Gagasa, E.; D'Souza, R.

Nonverbal Motion Legibility Cues for Human-Robot Spatial Interaction",2021-04-06,"Background: There is a need for better prediction of disease severity in patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Soluble angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (sACE2) arises from shedding of membrane ACE2 (mACE2) that is known to be a receptor for the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2; however, its value as a biomarker for disease severity is unknown. This study evaluated the predictive value of sACE2 in the context of other known biomarkers of inflammation and tissue damage (C-reactive protein [CRP], growth/differentiation factor-15 [GDF-15], interleukin-6 [IL-6], and soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 [sFlt-1]) in patients with and without SARS-CoV-2 with different clinical outcomes. Methods: For univariate analyses, median differences between biomarker levels were calculated for the following patient groups classified according to clinical outcome: reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive (Groups 1 - 4); RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 negative following previous SARS-CoV-2 infection (Groups 5 and 6); and RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 negative controls (Group 7). Results: Median levels of CRP, GDF-15, IL-6, and sFlt-1 were significantly higher in patients with SARS-CoV-2 who were admitted to hospital compared with patients who were discharged (all p<0.001), whereas levels of sACE2 were significantly lower (p<0.001). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis of sACE2 provided cut-offs for the prediction of hospital admission of [≤]0.05 ng/mL (positive predictive value: 89.1%) and [≥]0.42 ng/mL (negative predictive value: 84.0%). Conclusion: These findings support further investigation of sACE2, either as a single biomarker or as part of a panel, to predict hospitalisation risk and disease severity in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.","Diaz Troyano, N.; Gabriel Medina, P.; Weber, S.; Klammer, M.; Barquin-DelPino, R.; Castillo-Ribelles, L.; Esteban, A.; Hernandez-Gonzalez, M.; Ferrer-Costa, R.; Pumarola, T.; Rodriguez Frias, F.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.10.13.21264901v1?rss=1,475

We observed severe delayed drug hypersensitivity reactions (DHR) in a significant subset. Because alleles of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) loci can mediate DHR, we investigated HLA genotype association with these DHR. We typed subjects treated with these inhibitors: 34 sJIA/DHR/DLD, 11 sJIA/DHR without DLD, 18 drug-tolerant sJIA, and 19 Kawasaki disease (KD) patients in an anti-IL-1(anakinra) trial. We also accessed genotypes from a large sJIA case/control cohort. We first compared White subjects with sJIA/DHR to 550 ancestry-matched sJIA subjects. We found striking enrichments of HLA-DRB1*15:01, HLA-DQA1*01:02, and DQB1*06:02, alleles in near-complete linkage (White individuals). HLA-DRB1*15:01 (as haplotype proxy) was increased in White sJIA subjects with DHR/DLD versus sJIA drug-tolerant controls and was observed upon inclusion of sJIA+DHR-only and KD+DHR White subjects. In our entire cohort regardless of ancestry, 75% carried HLA-DRB1*15:01 or the structurally related DRB1*15:03 and DRB1*15:06, which were absent among drug-tolerant subjects (p=5 x 10-13; Odds Ratio lower bound=20.11). Patients who harbor HLA-DRB1*15 alleles are at high risk of developing DHR to anti-IL-1/IL-6. Our data also suggest DHR maybe a trigger/enhancer of DLD in sJIA patients and support performing prospective HLA screening in sJIA, its adult-onset counterpart, and other inflammatory conditions where these drugs are used, such as KD.","Hollenbach, J.; Ombrello, M.; Tremoulet, A.; Rosa Duque, J.

However, when a substantial portion of the population is vaccinated, natural selection will shift towards favoring variants that can resist the vaccine.

181088,SciLens News Platform: A System for Real-Time Evaluation of News Articles,2020-08-27,"Entrance of coronavirus into cells happens through the spike proteins on the virus surface, for which the spike protein should be cleaved into S1 and S2 domains. This cleavage is mediated by furin, a member of the proprotein convertases family, which can specifically cleave Arg-X-X-Arg down arrow sites of the substrates. Here, folate (folic acid), a water-soluble B vitamin, is introduced for the inhibition of furin activity. Therefore, molecular insight into the prevention of furin activity in the presence of folic acid derivatives is presented. To this aim, molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and binding free energy calculations were performed to clarify the inhibitory mechanism of these compounds. In this regard, molecular docking studies were conducted to probe the furin binding sites of folic acid derivatives. The MD simulation results indicated that these drugs can efficiently bind to the furin active site. While the folic acid molecule tended to be positioned slightly towards the Glu271, Tyr313, Ala532, Gln488, and Asp530 amino acids of furin at short and long ranges, the folinic acid molecule interacted with Glu271, Ser311, Arg490, Gln488, and Lys499 amino acids. Consequently, binding free energy calculations illustrated that folic acid (-27.90 kcal mol(-1)) has better binding in comparison with folinic acid (-12.84 kcal mol(-1)).","Sheybani, Z.; Dokoohaki, M.

There are currently no approved antiviral drugs or vaccine options available for treatment. Patients with severe cases of COVID-19 are receiving supportive care to manage life-threatening symptoms of viral pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Clinical and pathological evidence suggests that patients with severe COVID-19 infections suffer from cytokine storm syndrome, which leads to unfavorable health outcomes. Unfortunately, the conventional pharmacotherapies for cytokine storm syndrome are associated with immunosuppression and various other side effects that may worsen the patients' health status and healing capability. This study is to review the literature on how zinc status may affect susceptibility and outcomes of a viral infection, as well as to explore the possible beneficial effects of supplementing zinc to alleviate COVID-19 duration and severity. We propose zinc supplementation as a viable therapeutic approach when used alone or in combination with other drugs to combat cytokine storm syndrome in COVID-19 patients. The supplementation may be especially effective for elderly patients or patients with co-morbidity already deficient in zinc. More level I randomized controlled studies are needed to determine the clinical efficacy of zinc supplementation as a potential low-cost intervention to reduce morbidity and mortality due to pneumonia and ARDS in COVID-19 patients.","Hoang, BaXuan Han Bo",Reviews in Medical Microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1097/mrm.0000000000000263,475

This study aims to develop a theory that attempts to explain the older adults’ resiliency perspectives during crisis and how it has affected their well-being and quality of life as population group. Deductive theory generation using axiomatic approach was adopted resulting to five axioms that served as basis for the generation of three propositions such as: (1) An older person’s health needs have tendencies to develop into a health threat, (2) when the threat is perceived, older persons developed a sense of internal control and adaptation to the changes it creates known as internal resiliency, and (3) internal resiliency can influence the quality of life in old age. The evolved theory suggests that in times of crisis (e.g., COVID-19 pandemic), health needs develop into a health threat that compels older persons to develop internal resiliency in order to preserve their integrity, wellbeing and quality of life. This study widens the nursing perspectives in addressing older persons’ resiliency by the unique condition at which older clients are placed affecting both the pathological nature of the illness as well as the preventive interventions which the society is forced to implement.","Sadang, Jonaid Mustapha; Palompon, Daisy R; en,",Belitung Nursing Journal,https://doi.org/10.33546/bnj.1300,475

Since COVID-19 spreads mainly via close contact among people, social distancing has become an effective manner to slow down the spread. However, completely forbidding close contact can also lead to unacceptable damage to the society. Thus, a system that can effectively monitor people's social distance and generate corresponding alerts when a high infection probability is detected is in urgent need.In this paper, we propose SmartDistance, a smartphone based software framework that monitors people's interaction in an effective manner, and generates a reminder whenever the infection probability is high. Specifically, SmartDistance dynamically senses both the relative distance and orientation during social interaction with a well-designed relative positioning system. In addition, it recognizes different events (e.g., speaking, coughing) and determines the infection space through a droplet transmission model. With event recognition and relative positioning, SmartDistance effectively detects risky social interaction, generates an alert immediately, and records the relevant data for close contact reporting. We prototype SmartDistance on different Android smartphones, and the evaluation shows it reduces the false positive rate from 33% to 1% and the false negative rate from 5% to 3% in infection risk detection. © 2021 IEEE.","Li, L.; Wang, X.; Zheng, W.; Xu, C.

The spike glycoprotein, S, which mediates receptor binding and membrane fusion, plays a critical role in MHV pathogenesis. However, viral proteins other than S also contribute to pathogenicity. The JHM strain of MHV is highly neurovirulent and expresses a second spike glycoprotein, the hemagglutinin esterase (HE), which is not produced by MHV-A59, a hepatotropic but only mildly neurovirulent strain. To investigate a possible role for HE in MHV-induced neurovirulence, isogenic recombinant MHV-A59 viruses were generated that produced either (i) the wild-type protein, (ii) an enzymatically inactive HE protein, or (iii) no HE at all (A. Lissenberg, M. M. Vrolijk, A. L. W. van Vliet, M. A. Langereis, J. D. F. de Groot-Mijnes, P. J. M. Rottier, and R. J. de Groot, J. Virol. 79:15054-15063, 2005 [accompanying paper]). A second, mirror set of recombinant viruses was constructed in which, in addition, the MHV-A59 S gene had been replaced with that from MHV-JHM. The expression of HE in combination with A59 S did not affect the tropism, pathogenicity, or spread of the virus in vivo. However, in combination with JHM S, the expression of HE, regardless of whether it retained esterase activity or not, resulted in increased viral spread within the central nervous system and in increased neurovirulence. Our findings suggest that the properties of S receptor utilization and/or fusogenicity mainly determine organ and host cell tropism but that HE enhances the efficiency of infection and promotes viral dissemination, at least in some tissues, presumably by serving as a second receptor-binding protein.","Kazi, Lubna; Lissenberg, Arjen; Watson, Richard; de Groot, Raoul J; Weiss, Susan R",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16306577/,475

188937,TRAF3: a novel tumor suppressor gene in macrophages.,2015,"INTRODUCTION The immune system could be affected by a mixture of factors. It is customary to classify factors that affect the immune system into three main groups: hereditary, environmental and hormonal factors. When those factors deviate from their normal physiological effect, in the genetically pre-dispositioned, an autoimmune disease may erupt and a lymphoma may develop as a result. Viruses are a significant part of the environmental factors that affect the immune system. Recent evidence demonstrates the ability of the COVID-19 virus to induce hyper-stimulation of the immune system, thus leading to the formation of autoantibodies in patients. This effect of the COVID-19 virus is caused by two main courses of action: firstly, its ability to induce hyper-stimulation of the immune system; secondly, its molecular similarity to humans. Numerous records demonstrate the tendency of severely ill COVID-19 patients to develop multiple autoantibodies known to be found in common autoimmune diseases, such as antinuclear antibodies, antiphospholipid antibodies, and many more. Additionally, many case reports have been published on COVID-19 infected patients who developed autoimmune diseases.

From personalized medicine to extraterrestrial life.,2003,"In order to investigate the mechanisms involved in the processing of infectious bronchitis virus polyproteins, several candidate regions of the genome have been cloned and expressed in vitro. During these studies it was observed that the translation product encoded by one of these clones (pKT205) was poorly expressed. Biochemical and genetic analyses revealed that the basis for the poor expression was a post-translational event involving ubiquitination of the protein and degradation by an ATP-dependent system operating in the reticulocyte lysate used for the in vitro expression. Two independently acting regions which conferred instability were identified, one of which mapped to the predicted 3C protease domain, contained within the 5' end of the clone, while the other, more C-terminal region, was effective in conferring instability upon a heterologous protein to which it had been transferred. These regions may influence the stability of the authentic viral protein(s) in vivo and hence allow for the control of their expression and/or function at the level of proteolysis by cellular protease(s).","Tibbles, K W; Brierley, I; Cavanagh, D; Brown, T D",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8847511/,475
191140,Funding the global control of bird flu.,2006,"Cough is the most common illness-related reason for ambulatory care visits in the United States. Acute bronchitis is a clinical diagnosis characterized by cough due to acute inflammation of the trachea and large airways without evidence of pneumonia. Pneumonia should be suspected in patients with tachypnea, tachycardia, dyspnea, or lung findings suggestive of pneumonia, and radiography is warranted. Pertussis should be suspected in patients with cough persisting for more than two weeks that is accompanied by symptoms such as paroxysmal cough, whooping cough, and post-tussive emesis, or recent pertussis exposure. The cough associated with acute bronchitis typically lasts about two to three weeks, and this should be emphasized with patients. Acute bronchitis is usually caused by viruses, and antibiotics are not indicated in patients without chronic lung disease. Antibiotics have been shown to provide only minimal benefit, reducing the cough or illness by about half a day, and have adverse effects, including allergic reactions, nausea and vomiting, and Clostridium difficile infection. Evaluation and treatment of bronchitis include ruling out secondary causes for cough, such as pneumonia; educating patients about the natural course of the disease; and recommending symptomatic treatment and avoidance of unnecessary antibiotic use. Strategies to reduce inappropriate antibiotic use include delayed prescriptions, patient education, and calling the infection a chest cold.","Kinkade, Scott; Long, Natalie A",American family physician,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27929206/,475

We aimed to evaluate factors associated with resumption of post-operative chemotherapy in patients with advanced cancer undergoing explorative laparotomy for bowel obstruction. METHODS This retrospective cohort study was conducted between 2009 and 2013 at Herlev Hospital, Denmark. All patients with advanced cancer were identified from a local electronic database containing all emergency laparotomies. Adult patients with mechanical bowel obstruction were included if they had any kind of cancer and had been under active oncological treatment within the last eight weeks prior to surgery. Demographic, clinical, pre-, and post-operative data were collected and reviewed manually. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify predictors for resuming oncological treatment. RESULTS A total of 76 patients admitted with bowel obstruction and undergoing oncological treatment within eight weeks before surgery were included. Post-operatively, cancer treatment was resumed in 58% of patients. An American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score less-than III (odds ratio = 12.6 (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.9-54.6); p = 0.001) and a performance status less-than 3 (odds ratio = 9.7 (95% CI: 1.4-67.2); p = 0.021) were associated with resuming post-operative cancer treatment. CONCLUSIONS We found that ASA score and performance status are associated with resumption of cancer treatment post-operatively and should be taken into consideration when considering the treatment strategy for patients with advanced cancer and malignant bowel obstruction.

MATERIALS AND METHODS In 341 patients with primary and secondary liver cancer, pretreatment hepatic angiograms, as well as single-photon emission computed tomography coregistered with magnetic resonance imaging scans, were obtained. Extrahepatic tracer deposition was identified in 33 patients (9.7%) necessitating repeat assessment. Images were reviewed to correlate the site of MAA accumulation with causative gastrointestinal vessels, and repeat angiograms served as reference standard. RESULTS At repeat angiography, the source of extrahepatic flow was identified and eliminated in 31 of 33 patients (93.9%). In 20 patients (60.6%), successful embolization of nontarget vessels was achieved, in 13 patients (39.4%), MAA was administered more distally. Afterward, extrahepatic MAA deposition was eliminated in 30 patients (90.9%). CONCLUSION The algorithm of repeat assessment in case of extrahepatic MAA accumulation has proven highly effective to eliminate extrahepatic shunting, thus decreasing the risk of postradioembolization complications due to inadvertent visceral microsphere deposition.","Dudeck, Oliver; Wilhelmsen, Skadi; Ulrich, Gerhard; Löwenthal, David; Pech, Maciej; Amthauer, Holger; Ricke, Jens",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21833803/,475
199991,Deep Learning for Novel Antimicrobial Peptide Design,2021,"Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is linked with all clinical forms of Kaposi sarcoma and several lymphoproliferative disorders. Like other herpesviruses, KSHV becomes latent in the infected cells, expressing only a few genes that are essential for the establishment and maintenance of its latency and for the survival of the infected cells. Inhibiting the expression of these latent genes should lead to eradication of herpesvirus infection. All currently available drugs are ineffective against latent infection. Here we show, for the first time to our knowledge, that latent infection with KSHV in B lymphocytes can be terminated by glycyrrhizic acid (GA), a triterpenoid compound earlier shown to inhibit the lytic replication of other herpesviruses. We demonstrate that GA disrupts latent KSHV infection by downregulating the expression of latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) and upregulating the expression of viral cyclin and selectively induces cell death of KSHV-infected cells. We show that reduced levels of LANA lead to p53 reactivation, an increase in ROS, and mitochondrial dysfunction, which result in G1 cell cycle arrest, DNA fragmentation, and oxidative stress-mediated apoptosis. Latent genes are involved in KSHV-induced oncogenesis, and strategies to interfere with their expression might prove useful for eradicating latent KSHV infection and have future therapeutic implications.","Curreli, Francesca; Friedman-Kien, Alvin E; Flore, Ornella",The Journal of clinical investigation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15765147/,475
199992,Deep Learning for Novel Antimicrobial Peptide Design,2021,"Expression of the exceptionally large RNA genomes of CoVs involves multiple regulatory mechanisms, including extensive proteolytic processing of the large replicase polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, by two types of cysteine proteases: the chymotrypsin-like main protease and papain-like accessory proteases (PLpros). Here, we characterized the proteolytic processing of the human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) amino-proximal pp1a/pp1ab region by two paralogous PLpro activities. Reverse-genetics data revealed that replacement of the PL2pro active-site cysteine was lethal. By contrast, the PL1pro activity proved to be dispensable for HCoV-229E virus replication, although reversion of the PL1pro active-site substitution to the wild-type sequence after several passages in cell culture indicated that there was selection pressure to restore the PL1pro activity. Further experiments showed that both PL1pro and PL2pro were able to cleave the nsp1-nsp2 cleavage site, with PL2pro cleaving the site less efficiently. The PL1pro-negative mutant genotype could be stably maintained in cell culture when the nsp1-nsp2 site was replaced by a short autoproteolytic sequence, suggesting that the major driving force for the observed reversion of the PL1pro mutation was the requirement for efficient nsp1-nsp2 cleavage. The data suggest that the two HCoV-229E PLpro paralogs have overlapping substrate specificities but different functions in viral replication. Within the tightly controlled interplay of the two protease activities, PL2pro plays a universal and essential proteolytic role that appears to be assisted by the PL1pro paralog at specific sites. Functional and evolutionary implications of the differential amino-terminal polyprotein-processing pathways among the main CoV lineages are discussed.","Ziebuhr, John; Schelle, Barbara; Karl, Nadja; Minskaia, Ekaterina; Bayer, Sonja; Siddell, Stuart G; Gorbalenya, Alexander E; Thiel, Volker",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17251282/,475
200890,How fake news about coronavirus became a second pandemic,2020,"OBJECTIVES To study the impact of the first COVID-19 pandemic wave state of emergency on qualitative and quantitative indicators of demand for the services of a hospital emergency department. MATERIAL AND METHODS Retrospective cross-sectional analysis of all visits by adults to the department during the Spanish state of emergency. The findings were compared to those for a similar period before the pandemic. We collected data for care variables, triage levels, wait times before triage, triage times, and times to first contact with a physician, discharge diagnostic codes, revisits within 72 hours, among other information. We also analyzed demand for timesensitive emergencies. RESULTS Demand for emergency department care decreased overall by 48.3% (95% CI, 0.48%-0.49%) while the state of emergency was in effect. The decrease was 60.7% (95% CI, 0.60%-0.61%) during phase 0 (lockdown). The decrease was more marked for the lower priority emergencies during lockdown (phase 0), at 60.5% for the lowest (level V) versus 35.1% for the highest priority (level I). The most frequent diagnoses were for respiratory conditions, followed by abdominal pain. There was a decrease in demand for treatment for all time-sensitive conditions. CONCLUSION Overall demand for emergency care for adults fell during the first COVID-19 pandemic wave state of emergency in Spain. Lower priority emergencies for less serious problems saw the greatest decreases. We also saw a decrease in the use of time-dependent procedures.","Montero-Pérez, Francisco Javier; Jiménez Murillo, Luís Manuel",Emergencias : revista de la Sociedad Espanola de Medicina de Emergencias,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34581527/,475

We report here the epidemiological, clinical, radiological and laboratory findings of the first cluster of SARS-CoV-2 infection among the tourists. Methods: Information was collected on demographic details, travel and exposure history, comorbidities, timelines of events, date of symptom onset and duration of hospitalization from the 16 Italian tourists and an Indian with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The clinical, laboratory, radiologic and treatment data was abstracted from their medical records and all tourists were followed up till their recovery or discharge or death. Throat and deep nasal swab specimens were collected on days 3, 8, 15, 18, 23 and 25 to evaluate viral clearance. Results: A group of 23 Italian tourists reached New Delhi, India, on February 21, 2020 and along with three Indians visited several tourist places in Rajasthan. By March 3, 2020, 17 of the 26 (attack rate: 65.4%) had become positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of these 17 patients, nine were symptomatic, while eight did not show any symptoms.

A two-stage triage pathway was used to prioritise lower gastrointestinal (LGI) endoscopy for suspected CRC during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: All patients referred for an LGI endoscopy via a 2ww referral pathway between March 2020 and July 2020 were assessed. The first stage triaged patients to high, standard or low risk of CRC based on symptoms and faecal immunochemical test (FIT), and offered CT scans to those at high risk. The second stage, endoscopy prioritisation (EP), incorporated the CT results, FIT and symptoms to triage into four groups, EP1-EP4;with EP1 being the most urgent and EP4 the least. The primary outcome measure was CRC detection. Results: 514 patients were included. The risk of CRC was triaged as high in 190/514 patients (37%), standard in 274/514 patients (53%) and low in 50/514 (10%) patients. 422/514 patients (82%) underwent endoscopy with triage to EP1 in 52/422 (12%), EP2 in 105/422 (25%), EP3 in 210/422 (50%) and EP4 in 55/422 (13%). CRC was detected in 23 patients (5.4%). CRC was significantly more frequent in the EP1 group (23.1%, relative risk (RR)=16.2) and EP2 group (6.7%, RR=4.7) compared with EP3 group (1.4%). All CRC lesions were identified by CT imaging when performed prior to LGI endoscopy. Conclusion: This triage pathway designated 83% of patients with CRC to either EP1 or EP2. During a period of limited endoscopy provision, this pathway effectively prioritises endoscopy for those at greatest risk of CRC.","Archer, T.; Aziz, I.; Kurien, M.; Knott, V.; Ball, A.",Frontline Gastroenterology,,475

This study aimed to examine the anxiety and depression levels and related factors among health care professionals working in operating theaters (anesthetic technicians and nurses) during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. DESIGN: The universe of this descriptive study consisted of health care professionals working in operating theaters in various health care institutions in Turkey. METHODS: Data were collected online between April 9, 2020 and April 12, 2020 using a SurveyMonkey Questionnaire (SurveyMonkey, San Mateo, CA) and health care workers who volunteered to participate in the study were contacted via the social media platforms Twitter, LinkedIn, and WhatsApp and asked to answer the questionnaire. Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS version 22.0 software. FINDINGS: A total of 702 health care professionals working in operating theaters participated in the study. The mean depression and anxiety scores of the participants were found to be 9.4 ± 4.6 (min 0 to max 21) and 10.0 ± 4.5 (min 0 to max 21), respectively. Depression scores were statistically significantly higher among females, single individuals, those who had children, those living with a person aged 60 years or older (P < .05). Meanwhile, anxiety scores were statistically significantly higher among females, single individuals (including widowed and divorced), university graduates, those with at least one chronic disease, and those whose workload increased (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: The present study showed that anxiety and depression symptoms were high among health care professionals working in operating theaters. To reduce these symptoms, psychological conditions of health care professionals can be followed continuously and regularly via standard procedures, and necessary interventions can be provided in the early period.","Koksal, Ersin; Dost, Burhan; Terzi, Özlem; Ustun, Yasemin B; Özdin, Selçuk; Bilgin, Sezgin",J. perianesth. nurs,,475

The severe response to SARS-CoV-2 appears to include a ""cytokine storm,"" which indicates a state of hyperinflammation and subsequent dysfunction of multiple organs and tissues in the most severe cases. This could be the reason why populations at the highest risk for death from the SARS-CoV-2 infection-induced disease (coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]) are those suffering from chronic low-grade inflammation, but prone to hyperinflammation. This includes individuals of advanced age and those with obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and metabolic syndrome. Inflammation resolution is strongly dependent on lipid mediators, the specialized pro-resolution mediators (SPMs). &#969;-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (&#969;-3 PUFAs) are precursors of very potent SPMs, including resolvins, protectins, and maresins. Additionally, they are associated with a less aggressive inflammatory initiation, after competing with &#969;-6 fatty acids for eicosanoid synthesis. Therefore, it makes sense to consider the use of &#969;-3 PUFAs for clinical management of COVID-19 patients. &#969;-3 PUFAs may be given by oral, enteral, or parenteral routes; however, the parenteral route favors faster incorporation into plasma phospholipids, blood cells, and tissues. Here, we discuss these aspects to propose the parenteral infusion of &#969;-3 PUFAs as adjuvant immunopharmacotherapy for hospitalized patients with COVID-19.","Torrinhas, Raquel S; Calder, Philip C; Lemos, Gabriela O; Waitzberg, Dan L",Nutrition,,475

Despite the availability of a wide range of literature devoted to various aspects of advertising, the investigation of its influence on the processes occurring in society is still relevant. Previous researches in this field focused primarily on consumer behaviour influence techniques, the effectiveness of various marketing channels, and new forms of advertising centred at increasing trust among the target audience. The purpose of this study was to uncover how advertising impacts social processes during the COVID-19 pandemic. The research methodology included system analysis (for comprehensive study of coronavirus-related advertisements) and comparative analysis (to review Russian, Belarusian, and Ukrainian advertising strategies and identify dominant ones). The examination of coronavirus-related advertisements revealed a shift from advertising directed at increasing consumption towards its reduction. A comparative analysis of samples from Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine showed that the advertising market is closely related to the government and often appeals to negative emotions in all countries under consideration. However, their influence strategies are somewhat different. Belarus and Ukraine tend to apply provocative methods to attract the viewer's attention. In contrast, the Russian advertising industry prefers using the TV appeal of socially significant persons and emotionally neutral outdoor advertisements with information on the proper rules of conduct. The results of this study can be applied by officials for developing information policies especially those related to pandemic and other extraordinary circumstances.

This decision problem is closely related to the problem of optimal sensor selection, which is a very active research subject in control engineering. The goal of this paper is to propose a policy to smartly select the individuals to be tested. The main idea is to model the epidemics as a stochastic dynamic system and to select the individual to be tested accordingly to some optimality criteria, e.g. to minimize the probability of undetected asymptomatic cases. Every day, the probability of infection of the different individuals is updated making use of the stochastic model of the phenomenon and of the information collected in the previous days. Simulations for a closed community of 10'000 individuals show that the proposed technique, coupled with a selective confinement policy, can reduce the spread of the disease while limiting the number of individuals confined if compared to the simple contact tracing of positive and to an off-line test selection strategy based on the number of contacts.","Pezzutto, Matthias; Bono Rosselló, Nicolás; Schenato, Luca; Garone, Emanuele",Annual reviews in control,,475

218407,COVID has killed more than one million people. How many more will die?,2020,"Background: The reported number of COVID-19 patients increases on average along with the increased laboratory tests in Bangladesh implying a possibility of the spread of deadly coronavirus being out of control. Contrary to that, the government claims that it controls the spread of coronavirus through undertaking stringent policy measures. This different scenario leads this study on whether these measures have any positive impact on controlling the pandemic. Results: The results show that simulated number of patients (without policy measures) surpassed the actual number of patients (with policy measures) from the first week of July 2020 which may provide a signal about the positive impact of policy measures taken by the government. Conclusion: This study concludes that policy measures taken by the government are useful to some extent in controlling the coronavirus pandemic. As this pandemic lingers, people may lose their patience to stay at home. Consequently, some of the policies need further correction and change.","Akanda, Ayatullah Al Musabi; Ahmed, Redwan",Bull Natl Res Cent,,475

We examined adverse events (AE) following vaccination with 4vHPV from 11 years of post-marketing data, focusing on a period of enhanced surveillance and adverse events of special interest (AESI). METHODS: AE following 4vHPV doses administered between April 2007 and December 2017 reported to Australia's national regulator, the Therapeutic Goods Administration, were examined; reports collected during enhanced surveillance in 2013 and 2014 were analyzed separately. Age and sex-specific rates, using denominator data from the national HPV vaccination register, were determined. Pre-specified AESI were identified using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA®) Preferred Terms and examined in detail. FINDINGS: Following nine million doses of 4vHPV vaccine administered in Australia, 4551 AE reports were identified. The crude reporting rate was 39.8 per 100 000 doses in the funded cohorts, excluding the enhanced surveillance period. The reported rate of syncope in 12 to 13-year-old males and females was 29.6 per 100 000 doses during enhanced surveillance and 7.1 per 100 000 doses during the remaining study period; rates of syncope were higher in younger compared to older adolescents. The rate of anaphylaxis (0.32 per 100 000 doses) was consistent with published rates. Other AESI including autoimmune disease, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, primary ovarian insufficiency, Guillain-Barré syndrome, complex regional pain syndrome and venous thromboembolism, were reported at low rates and analysis did not reveal unexpected patterns that would suggest causal association. INTERPRETATION: AESI, apart from syncope, were reported rarely. The higher rate of syncope among younger adolescents highlights the need for management protocols to prevent syncope-related injury. Analysis of this large, longitudinal dataset in a country with high vaccine uptake, including a period of enhanced surveillance, affirms the safety profile of 4vHPV.","Phillips, Anastasia; Hickie, Megan; Totterdell, James; Brotherton, Julia; Dey, Aditi; Hill, Richard; Snelling, Tom; Macartney, Kristine",Vaccine,,475

222173,Auswirkungen des zweiten Shutdowns,2021,"Influenza-like illness (ILI) is a commonly measured syndromic signal representative of a range of acute respiratory infections. Reliable forecasts of ILI can support better preparation for patient surges in healthcare systems. Although ILI is an amalgamation of multiple pathogens with variable seasonal phasing and attack rates, most existing process-based forecasting systems treat ILI as a single infectious agent. Here, using ILI records and virologic surveillance data, we show that ILI signal can be disaggregated into distinct viral components. We generate separate predictions for six contributing pathogens (influenza A/H1, A/H3, B, respiratory syncytial virus, and human parainfluenza virus types 1-2 and 3), and develop a method to forecast ILI by aggregating these predictions. The relative contribution of each pathogen to the total ILI signal is estimated using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method upon forecast aggregation. We find highly variable overall contributions from influenza type A viruses across seasons, but relatively stable contributions for the other pathogens. Using historical data from 1997 to 2014 at US national and regional levels, the proposed forecasting system generates improved predictions of both seasonal and near-term targets relative to a baseline method that simulates ILI as a single pathogen. The hierarchical forecasting system can generate predictions for each viral component, as well as infer and predict their contributions to ILI, which may additionally help physicians determine the etiological causes of ILI in clinical settings.","Pei, Sen; Shaman, Jeffrey",PLoS Comput Biol,,475

Although insufficient to detect SARS-CoV-2 in the early phase of infection, antibody assays can be of great use for surveillance studies or for some coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients presenting late to the hospital. METHODS: This study evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of four commercial SARS-CoV-2 lateral flow antibody tests using 213 serum specimens from 90 PCR-positive confirmed COVID-19 patients. Of 59 negative control sera, 50 were obtained from patients with other respiratory infectious diseases before COVID-19 pandemic began while nine were from patients infected with other respiratory viruses, including two seasonal coronaviruses. RESULTS: The varied sensitivities for the four commercial kits were 70.9%, 65.3%, 45.1%, and 65.7% for BioMedomics, Autobio Diagnostics, Genbody, and KURABO, respectively, between sick days 1 and 155 in COVID-19 patients. The sensitivities of the four tests gradually increased over time after infection before sick day 5 (15.0%, 12.5%, 15.0%, and 20.0%); from sick day 11-15 (95.7%, 87.2%, 53.2%, and 89.4%); and after sick day 20 (100%, 100%, 68.6%, and 96.1%), respectively. For severe illness, the sensitivities were quite high in the late phase after sick day 15. The specificities were over 96% for all four tests. No cross-reaction due to other pathogens, including seasonal coronaviruses, was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated the large differences in the antibody test performances.

Here, we assess the feasibility of commercial-grade deep learning software for the detection of intracranial aneurysms on whole-brain anteroposterior and lateral 2D digital subtraction angiography images. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Seven hundred and six digital subtraction angiography images were included from a cohort of 240 patients (157 female, mean age 59 years, range 20-92; 83 male, mean age 55 years, range 19-83). Three hundred and thirty-five (47%) single frame anteroposterior and lateral images of a digital subtraction angiography series of 187 aneurysms (41 ruptured, 146 unruptured; average size 7±5.3 mm, range 1-5 mm; total 372 depicted aneurysms) and 371 (53%) aneurysm-negative study images were retrospectively analysed regarding the presence of intracranial aneurysms. The 2D data was split into testing and training sets in a ratio of 4:1 with 3D rotational digital subtraction angiography as gold standard. Supervised deep learning was performed using commercial-grade machine learning software (Cognex, ViDi Suite 2.0). Monte Carlo cross validation was performed. RESULTS: Intracranial aneurysms were detected with a sensitivity of 79%, a specificity of 79%, a precision of 0.75, a F1 score of 0.77, and a mean area-under-the-curve of 0.76 (range 0.68-0.86) after Monte Carlo cross-validation, run 45 times.

METHODS: The American Academy of Family Physicians National Research Network and the Robert Graham Center distributed weekly surveys from March 27, 2020, through June 15, 2020, to a network of more than 1960 physicians. Responses to the question, ""Could you please tell us about any financial impact the COVID-19 pandemic has had on your practice, if any?"" were analyzed using a grounded theory approach of qualitative analysis. The number of unique respondents who answered the financial impact question totaled 461 over the 12 weeks. RESULTS: Severe declines in patient visits, causing drastic revenue reductions, greatly impacted the ability to serve patients. Primary care clinicians and practices experienced significant changes in several areas about financial implications: patient visits, financial strain, staffing and telehealth. DISCUSSION: Preliminary findings revealed that even with Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, also known as CARES Act, funding, business viability remains questionable for some primary care practices. CONCLUSIONS: Low patient visits directly resulted in decreased revenues, which in turn, impacted staffing decisions and fueled telehealth implementation. It is difficult to predict whether patient visits will increase after June. Alternate payment models could provide some financial stability and address business viability.","Filippi, Melissa K; Callen, Elisabeth; Wade, Ann; Coffman, Megan; Westfall, John M; Jabbarpour, Yalda; Hester, Christina M; Carroll, Jennifer",J Am Board Fam Med,,475

This study assesses the impact on a large acute paediatric hospital service in London, evaluating the trends in the acute paediatric orthopaedic trauma referral caseload and operative casemix before (2019) and during (2020) COVID-19 lockdown.Patients and methods - A longitudinal retrospective observational prevalence study of both acute paediatric orthopaedic trauma referrals and operative caseload was performed for the first 6 ""golden weeks"" of lockdown. These data were compared with the same period in 2019. Statistical analyses included median (± median absolute deviation), risk and odds ratios as well as Fisher's exact test to calculate the statistical significance, set at p &#8804; 0.05.Results - Acute paediatric trauma referrals in 2020 were reduced by two-thirds compared with 2019 (n = 302 vs. 97) with a halving risk (RR 0.55) and odds ratios (OR 0.43) of sporting-related mechanism of injuries (p = 0.002). There was a greater use of outpatient telemedicine in the COVID-19 period with more Virtual Fracture Clinic use (OR 97, RR 84, p < 0.001), and fewer patients being seen for consultation and followed up face to face (OR 0.55, RR 0.05, p < 0.001).Interpretation - The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a decline in the number of acute paediatric trauma referrals, admissions, and operations during the COVID period. There has also been a significant change in the patient pathway with more being reviewed via the means of telemedicine to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission and exposure.

235004,Ways to look after yourself and others in 2021,2020,"Emerging data are linking coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with an increased risk of developing new-onset diabetes. The gut has been so far out of the frame of the discussion on the pathophysiology of COVID-19-induced diabetes, with the pancreas, liver, and adipose tissue being under the spotlight of medical research. Sodium-glucose co-transporters (SGLT) 1 represent important regulators of glucose absorption, expressed in the small intestine where they mediate almost all sodium-dependent glucose uptake. Similar to what happens in diabetes and other viral infections, SGLT1 upregulation could result in increased intestinal glucose absorption and subsequently promote the development of hyperglycaemia in COVID-19. Considering the above, the question whether dual SGLT (1 and 2) inhibition could contribute to improved outcomes in such cases sounds challenging, deserving further evaluation. Future studies need to clarify whether putative benefits of dual SGLT inhibition in COVID-19 outweigh potential risks, particularly with respect to drug-induced euglycaemic diabetic ketoacidosis, gastrointestinal side effects, and compromised host response to pathogens.","Koufakis, Theocharis; Metallidis, Symeon; Zebekakis, Pantelis; Kotsa, Kalliopi",,,475

Motivated by the extreme nature of the current global health landscape, which is plagued by the coronavirus pandemic, we seek to better understand and model extreme events. Modeling extreme events is common in practice and plays an important role in time-series prediction applications. Our goal is to (i) compare and investigate the effect of some common extreme events modeling methods to explore which method can be practical in reality and (ii) accelerate the deep learning training process, which commonly uses deep recurrent neural network (RNN), by implementing the asynchronous local Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) framework among multiple compute nodes. In order to verify our distributed extreme events modeling, we evaluate our proposed framework on a stock data set S\&P500, with a standard recurrent neural network. Our intuition is to explore the (best) extreme events modeling method which could work well under the distributed deep learning setting. Moreover, by using asynchronous distributed learning, we aim to significantly reduce the communication cost among the compute nodes and central server, which is the main bottleneck of almost all distributed learning frameworks. We implement our proposed work and evaluate its performance on representative data sets, such as S&P500 stock in $5$-year period. The experimental results validate the correctness of the design principle and show a significant training duration reduction upto $8$x, compared to the baseline single compute node. Our results also show that our proposed work can achieve the same level of test accuracy, compared to the baseline setting.","Nguyen, Nhuong V.; Legitime, Sybille",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.03211v2.pdf,475

238673,Out of reach but never alone easing the pain of visiting restrictions,2020,"Sepsis is a life-threatening condition caused by heightened host immune responses post infection. Despite intensive research, most of the existing diagnostic methods remain non-specific, labour-intensive, time-consuming or are not sensitive enough for rapid and timely diagnosis of the onset and progression of sepsis. The present work was undertaken to explore the potential of Raman spectroscopy to identify the biomarkers of sepsis in a label-free and minimally invasive manner using different mouse models of inflammation. The sera of BALB/c mice infected with Salmonella Typhimurium reveal extensive hemolysis, as indicated by the Raman bands that are characteristic of the porphyrin ring of hemoglobin (668, 743, 1050, 1253 and 1397 cm-1) which increase in a kinetic manner. These markers are also observed in a lipopolysaccharide-induced endotoxic shock model, but not in a thioglycollate-induced sterile peritonitis model. These data demonstrate that hemolysis is a signature of systemic, but not localised, inflammation. To further validate our observations, sepsis was induced in the nitric oxide synthase 2 (Nos2-/-) deficient strain which is more sensitive to infection. Interestingly, Nos2-/- mice exhibit a higher degree of hemolysis than C57BL/6 mice. Sepsis-induced hemolysis was also confirmed using resonance Raman spectroscopy with 442 nm excitation which demonstrated a pronounced increase in the resonant Raman bands at 670 and 1350 cm-1 in sera of the infected mice. This is the first study to identify inflammation-induced hemolysis in mouse models of sepsis using Raman spectral signatures for hemoglobin. The possible implications of this method in detecting hemolysis in different inflammatory pathologies, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, are discussed.","Verma, Taru; Majumdar, Shamik; Yadav, Shikha; Ahmed, Syed Moiz; Umapathy, Siva; Nandi, Dipankar",Analyst,,475
239080,Generating indicator species for bird monitoring within the humid forests of northeast Central America,2021,"SARS-CoV-2, the causing agent of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, is a beta-coronavirus which has 80% genetic homology with SARS-CoV, but displays increased virulence and transmissibility. Initially, SARS-CoV-2 was considered a respiratory virus generally causing a mild disease, only severe and fatal in the elderly and individuals with underlying conditions. Severe illnesses and fatalities were attributed to a cytokine storm, an excessive response from the host immune system. However, with the number of infections over 10 millions and still soaring, the insidious and stealthy nature of the virus has emerged, as it causes a vast array of diverse unexpected symptoms among infected individuals, including the young and healthy. It has become evident that besides infecting the respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can affect many organs, possibly through the infection of the endothelium. This review presents an overview of our learning curve with the novel virus emergence, transmission, pathology, biological properties and host-interactions. It also briefly describes remedial measures taken until an effective vaccine is available, that is non-pharmaceutical interventions to reduce the viral spread and the repurposing of existing drugs, approved or in development for other conditions to eliminate the virus or mitigate the cytokine storm.","Delcuve, Geneviève P; Lakowski, Ted M; Su, Ruey-Chyi; Beacon, Tasnim H; Davie, James R",IUBMB life,,475

243218,Neural Multi-Hop Reasoning With Logical Rules on Biomedical Knowledge Graphs,2021-03-18,"The degeneration of the arterial wall at the basis of the ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm (ATAA) is a complex multifactorial process, which may lead to clinical complications and, ultimately, death. Individual genetic, biological or hemodynamic factors are inadequate to explain the heterogeneity of ATAA development/progression mechanisms, thus stimulating the analysis of their complex interplay. Here the disruption of the hemodynamic environment in the ATAA is investigated integrating patient-specific computational hemodynamics, CT-based in vivo estimation of local aortic stiffness and advanced fluid mechanics methods of analysis. The final aims are (1) deciphering the ATAA spatiotemporal hemodynamic complexity and its link to near-wall topological features, and (2) identifying the existing links between arterial wall degeneration and hemodynamic insult. Technically, two methodologies are applied to computational hemodynamics data, the wall shear stress (WSS) topological skeleton analysis, and the Complex Networks theory. The same analysis was extended to the healthy aorta. As main findings of the study, we report that: (1) different spatiotemporal heterogeneity characterizes the ATAA and healthy hemodynamics, that markedly reflect on their WSS topological skeleton features; (2) a link (stronger than canonical WSS-based descriptors) emerges between the variation of contraction/expansion action exerted by WSS on the endothelium along the cardiac cycle, and ATAA wall stiffness. The findings of the study suggest the use of advanced methods for a deeper understanding of the hemodynamics disruption in ATAA, and candidate WSS topological skeleton features as promising indicators of local wall degeneration.","De Nisco, Giuseppe; Tasso, Paola; Calò, Karol; Mazzi, Valentina; Gallo, Diego; Condemi, Francesca; Farzaneh, Solmaz; Avril, Stéphane; Morbiducci, Umberto",Med Eng Phys,,475

To determine the rapidity of viral clearance and safety of ivermectin among adult SARS-CoV-2 patients we conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of oral ivermectin alone (12 mg once daily for 5 days) or in combination with doxycycline (12 mg ivermectin single dose and 200 mg stat doxycycline day-1 followed by 100 mg 12hrly for next 4 days) compared with placebo among 72 hospitalized patients in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Clinical symptoms of fever, cough and sore throat were comparable among the three treatment arms. Virological clearance was earlier in the 5-day ivermectin treatment arm versus the placebo group (9.7 days vs. 12.7 days; P = 0.02); but not with the ivermectin + doxycycline arm (11.5 days; P = 0.27). There were no severe adverse drug events recorded in the study. A 5-day course of ivermectin was found to be safe and effective in treating mild COVID-19 adult patients.

244607,Sharp U-Net: Depthwise Convolutional Network for Biomedical Image Segmentation,2021-07-27,"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an emerging coronavirus that has resulted in more than 2 000 000 laboratory-confirmed cases including over 145 000 deaths. Although SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV share a number of common clinical manifestations, SARS-CoV-2 appears to be highly efficient in person-to-person transmission and frequently causes asymptomatic or presymptomatic infections. However, the underlying mechanisms that confer these viral characteristics of high transmissibility and asymptomatic infection remain incompletely understood. METHODS: We comprehensively investigated the replication, cell tropism, and immune activation profile of SARS-CoV-2 infection in human lung tissues with SARS-CoV included as a comparison. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 infected and replicated in human lung tissues more efficiently than SARS-CoV. Within the 48-hour interval, SARS-CoV-2 generated 3.20-fold more infectious virus particles than did SARS-CoV from the infected lung tissues (P < .024). SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV were similar in cell tropism, with both targeting types I and II pneumocytes and alveolar macrophages. Importantly, despite the more efficient virus replication, SARS-CoV-2 did not significantly induce types I, II, or III interferons in the infected human lung tissues. In addition, while SARS-CoV infection upregulated the expression of 11 out of 13 (84.62%) representative proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines, SARS-CoV-2 infection only upregulated 5 of these 13 (38.46%) key inflammatory mediators despite replicating more efficiently. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides the first quantitative data on the comparative replication capacity and immune activation profile of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infection in human lung tissues. Our results provide important insights into the pathogenesis, high transmissibility, and asymptomatic infection of SARS-CoV-2.","Chu, Hin; Chan, Jasper Fuk-Woo; Wang, Yixin; Yuen, Terrence Tsz-Tai; Chai, Yue; Hou, Yuxin; Shuai, Huiping; Yang, Dong; Hu, Bingjie; Huang, Xiner; Zhang, Xi; Cai, Jian-Piao; Zhou, Jie; Yuan, Shuofeng; Kok, Kin-Hang; To, Kelvin Kai-Wang; Chan, Ivy Hau-Yee; Zhang, Anna Jinxia; Sit, Ko-Yung; Au, Wing-Kuk; Yuen, Kwok-Yung",Clin Infect Dis,,475

However, two major changes have been observed over time. In the mid-18th century in France and during the 19th century in Europe, the ""first contraceptive revolution"" was characterized by the adoption of ""withdrawal"" by married couples. The ""second contraceptive revolution"" took place from the second half of the 20th century, with the gradual spread of the pill and the Intra-Uterine Device (IUD) among different social groups.

247784,A pandemic in all but name,2020,"BACKGROUND: Coverage rates for immunization have dropped in lower income countries during the COVID-19 pandemic, raising concerns regarding potential outbreaks and premature death. In order to re-invigorate immunization service delivery, sufficient financing must be made available from all sources, and particularly from government resources. This study utilizes the most recent data available to provide an updated comparison of available data sources on government spending on immunization. METHODS: We examined data from WHO/UNICEF's Joint Reporting Form (JRF), country Comprehensive Multi-Year Plan (cMYP), country co-financing data for Gavi, and WHO National Health Accounts (NHA) on government spending on immunization for consistency by comparing routine and vaccine spending where both values were reported. We also examined spending trends across time, quantified underreporting and utilized concordance analyses to assess the magnitude of difference between the data sources. RESULTS: Routine immunization spending reported through the cMYP was nearly double that reported through the JRF (rho = 0.64, 95% 0.53 to 0.77) and almost four times higher than that reported through the NHA on average (rho = 3.71, 95% 1.00 to 13.87). Routine immunization spending from the JRF was comparable to spending reported in the NHA (rho = 1.30, 95% 0.97 to 1.75) and vaccine spending from the JRF was comparable to that from the cMYP data (rho = 0.97, 95% 0.84 to 1.12). Vaccine spending from both the JRF and cMYP was higher than Gavi co-financing by a at least two (rho = 2.66, 95% 2.45 to 2.89) and (rho = 2.66, 95% 2.15 to 3.30), respectively. IMPLICATIONS: Overall, our comparative analysis provides a degree of confidence in the validity of existing reporting mechanisms for immunization spending while highlighting areas for potential improvements. Users of these data sources should factor these into consideration when utilizing the data. Additionally, partners should work with governments to encourage more reliable, comprehensive, and accurate reporting of vaccine and immunization spending.","Ikilezi, Gloria; Bachmeier, Steven D; Cogswell, Ian E; Maddison, Emilie R; Stutzman, Hayley N; Tsakalos, Golsum; Brenzel, Logan; Dieleman, Joseph L; Micah, Angela E",Vaccine,,475

249632,What If Biden Wins?,2020,"BACKGROUND: The proposition that a pregnancy is 40 weeks or 280 days in duration is attributed to the German obstetrician Franz Naegele (1778-1851). His rule adds nine months and seven days to the first day of the last menstrual period. The expected date of confinement from this formula is approximately right in the majority of cases. However, the idea that this rule can apply to every pregnant female - young or old, nulliparous or multigravida, Caucasian, Asian, African, or Indigenous - stretches credulity. In addition, many women regard the 40-week date as a deadline, which if crossed, may then place the baby under stress. Forty weeks is such a simple, round, convenient figure that it has proved difficult to challenge, despite criticism. Nonetheless, what might have been an appropriate formula in Germany in the 19th century deserves to be revisited in the 21st. AIMS: To review the length of pregnancy, in the light of current technology, in particular ultrasound scanning, and assisted reproductive techniques. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A Medline search was performed for variables on the length of pregnancy, the expected date of confinement, and prolonged pregnancy. RESULTS: A number of factors were found to significantly influence the length of a pregnancy, including ethnicity, height, variations in the menstrual cycle, the timing of ovulation, parity and maternal weight. CONCLUSIONS: Naegele's rule should be considered as a guideline for the expected date of confinement, and not a definite date.","Lawson, Gerald Wightman",,,475

The aim of this study is to describe the impact of nonpharmaceutical interventions on ICU admissions of non-coronavirus disease 2019-related patients. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Analysis of all reported adult patient admissions to New Zealand ICUs during Level 3 and Level 4 lockdown restrictions from March 23, to May 13, 2020, in comparison with equivalent periods from 5 previous years (2015-2019). SUBJECTS: Twelve-thousand one-hundred ninety-two ICU admissions during the time periods of interest were identified. MEASUREMENTS: Patient data were obtained from the Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society Adult Patient Database, Australian and New Zealand Intensive Society critical care resources registry, and Statistics New Zealand. Study variables included patient baseline characteristics and ICU resource use. MAIN RESULTS: Nonpharmaceutical interventions in New Zealand were associated with a 39.1% decrease in ICU admission rates (p < 0.0001). Both elective (-44.2%) and acute (-36.5%) ICU admissions were significantly reduced when compared with the average of the previous 5 years (both p < 0.0001). ICU occupancy decreased from a mean of 64.3% (2015-2019) to 39.8% in 2020. Case mix, ICU resource use per patient, and ICU and hospital mortality remained unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: The institution of nonpharmaceutical interventions was associated with a significant decrease in elective and acute ICU admissions and ICU resource use. These findings may help hospitals and health authorities planning for surge capacities and elective surgery management in future pandemics.","Gonzenbach, Tobias P; Mc Guinness, Shay P; Parke, Rachael L; Merz, Tobias M",Crit. care med,,475

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study based on secondary surveillance database analysis. SETTING: Nationwide Brazil. POPULATION OR SAMPLE: 978 Brazilian pregnant and postpartum women notified as COVID-19 Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) cases with complete outcome (death or cure) up to 18 June 2020. METHODS: Data was abstracted from the Brazilian ARDS Surveillance System (ARDS-SS) database. All eligible cases were included. Data on demographics, clinical characteristics, intensive care resources use and outcomes were collected. Risk factors for mortality were examined by multivariate logistic regression. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Case fatality rate. RESULTS: We identified 124 maternal deaths, corresponding to a case fatality rate among COVID-19 ARDS cases in the obstetric population of 12.7%. At least one comorbidity was present in 48.4% of fatal cases compared with 24.9% in survival cases. Among women who died, 58.9% were admitted to ICU, 53.2% had invasive ventilation and 29.0% had no respiratory support. The multivariate logistic regression showed that the main risk factors for maternal death by COVID-19 were being postpartum at onset of ARDS, obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease, whereas white ethnicity had a protective effect. CONCLUSIONS: Negative outcomes of COVID-19 in this population are affected by clinical characteristics but social determinants of health also seem to play a role. It is urgent to reinforce containment measures targeting the obstetric population and ensure high quality care throughout pregnancy and the postpartum period.

258241,Correlation Analysis between the Viral Load and the Progression of COVID-19,2021,"Aging and pre-existing conditions in older patients increase severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) severity and its complications, although the causes remain unclear. Apart from acute pulmonary syndrome, Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) can increasingly induce chronic conditions. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 triggers de novo type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) linked to age-associated cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancers, and neurodegeneration. Mechanistically, SARS-CoV-2 induces inflammation, possibly through damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) signaling and 'cytokine storm,' causing insulin resistance and the adiponectin (APN) paradox, a phenomenon linking metabolic dysfunction to chronic disease. Accordingly, preventing the APN paradox by suppressing APN-related inflammatory signaling might prove beneficial. A better understanding could uncover novel therapies for SARS-CoV-2 and its chronic disorders.","Ho, Gilbert; Ali, Alysha; Takamatsu, Yoshiki; Wada, Ryoko; Masliah, Eliezer; Hashimoto, Makoto",Drug discov. today,,475

Although LMSs with lots of features were developed for universities, the success of those systems is highly related to a detailed understanding of challenges and factors influencing the use of the systems among their users. HELMS (Higher Education Learning Management System) is a countrywide LMS used for teaching and learning during the quarantine period caused by covid-19 in Afghanistan universities. As it was the first experience of Afghan universities in using the learning management systems during the pandemic, challenges were expected to appear. No previous research has been conducted on either studying the challenges of using the HELMS or investigating the factors influencing the use of HELMS during the Covid-19 pandemic in Afghanistan. Hence, there was no unified view of the potential challenges of using HELMS and factors influencing the use of the HELMS among the researchers. This research aims to investigate the challenges that face the use of HELMS and explore the factors influencing the use of HELMS among both lecturers and students. This study employed a qualitative research method by conducting semi-structured interviews with 100 participants including university management, lecturers, and students. Thematic analysis was used as a method for the analysis of qualitative data. The findings of this research will help policymakers, researchers, and practitioners in public and private universities to grasp knowledge on the successful implementation and use of LMSs during covid-19 and afterward.","Mohammadi, Mustafa Kamel; Mohibbi, Abdul Aziz; Hedayati, Mohammad Hadi",Educ Inf Technol (Dordr),,475

The search for functional and healthy foods has increased the seaweed consumption in Europe and the USA. Seaweeds are a source of essential elements such as iodine. However, high intake levels of iodine can cause damages to human health. Red seaweeds like dulse (Palmaria palmata) and Irish moss (Chondrus crispus) are common in shops and large stores. The iodine level in 30 samples of red seaweeds (dulse and Irish moss) has been determined by redox volumetry with sodium thiosulfate to determine the iodine content of both species and to assess the iodine dietary exposure from dulse and Irish moss consumption. Irish moss (3.86 ± 1.49 mg/kg dry weight) has the highest average iodine content. Four grams per day of dehydrated Irish moss seaweeds contributes greatly to the iodine recommended daily intake (DRI) for children (25.7%). The consumption of analyzed seaweeds (4 g/day) does not pose a health risk. However, the consumption of 286 g/day of Irish moss would lead to exceeding the UL for the adult population set at 1100 µg/day.

To understand this crisis, physicians and public health researchers have searched history for insights, especially from a great outbreak approximately a century ago: the 1918 influenza pandemic. However, of the accounts examining the 1918 influenza pandemic and COVID-19, only a notable few discuss race. Yet, a rich, broader scholarship on race and epidemic disease as a ""sampling device for social analysis"" exists. This commentary examines the historical arc of the 1918 influenza pandemic, focusing on black Americans and showing the complex and sometimes surprising ways it operated, triggering particular responses both within a minority community and in wider racial, sociopolitical, and public health structures. This analysis reveals that critical structural inequities and health care gaps have historically contributed to and continue to compound disparate health outcomes among communities of color. Shifting from this context to the present, this article frames a discussion of racial health disparities through a resilience approach rather than a deficit approach and offers a blueprint for approaching the COVID-19 crisis and its afterlives through the lens of health equity.","Krishnan, Lakshmi; Ogunwole, S Michelle; Cooper, Lisa A",Ann Intern Med,,475

The present study design determines the diagnostic value of LUSS in the semi-quantitative assessment of pneumonia in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) neonates. METHODS: Eleven COVID-19 neonates born to mothers with COVID-19 infection and 11 age- and gender-matched controls were retrospectively studied. LUSS was acquired by assessing the lesions and aeration loss in 12 lung regions per subject. RESULTS: Most of the COVID-19 newborns presented with mild and atypical symptoms, mainly involving respiratory and digestive systems. In the COVID-19 group, a total of 132 regions of the lung were examined, 83 regions (62.8%) of which were detected abnormalities by LUS. Compared with controls, COVID-19 neonates showed sparse or confluent B-lines (83 regions), disappearing A-lines (83 regions), abnormal pleural lines (29 regions), and subpleural consolidations (2 regions). The LUSS was significantly higher in the COVID-19 group. In total, 49 regions (37%) were normal, 73 regions (55%) scored 1, and 10 regions (8%) scored 2 by LUSS. All the lesions were bilateral, with multiple regions involved. The majority of the lesions were located in the bilateral inferior and posterior regions. LUS detected abnormalities in three COVID-19 neonates with normal radiological performance. The intra-observer and inter-observer reproducibility of LUSS was excellent. CONCLUSIONS: LUS is a noninvasive, convenient, and sensitive method to assess neonatal COVID-19 pneumonia, and can be used as an alternative to the use of diagnostic radiography. LUSS provides valuable semi-quantitative information on the lesion distribution and severity.","Li, Wei; Fu, Manli; Qian, Chao; Liu, Xin; Zeng, Lingkong; Peng, Xuehua; Hong, Yue; Zhou, Huan; Yuan, Li",Pediatr Pulmonol,,475

Our goal is to transfer the rich set of mathematical foundations from the world of PDEs to neural networks. Besides structural insights we provide concrete examples and experimental evaluations of the resulting architectures. Using the example of generalised nonlinear diffusion in 1D, we consider explicit schemes, acceleration strategies thereof, implicit schemes, and multigrid approaches. We connect these concepts to residual networks, recurrent neural networks, and U-net architectures. Our findings inspire a symmetric residual network design with provable stability guarantees and justify the effectiveness of skip connections in neural networks from a numerical perspective. Moreover, we present U-net architectures that implement multigrid techniques for learning efficient solutions of partial differential equation models, and motivate uncommon design choices such as trainable nonmonotone activation functions. Experimental evaluations show that the proposed architectures save half of the trainable parameters and can thus outperform standard ones with the same model complexity.

Digital solutions seem to be optimal for providing rehabilitation at this time. The aim of this study was to investigate whether it is possible to conduct respiratory physical therapy with the use of telerehabilitation in Duchenne muscular dystrophy. METHODS: The study was conducted during an online conference for families with DMD. During the physical therapy panel we showed the video with the instructions of respiratory exercises. All participants (n = 152) were asked to fill in the online survey evaluating the quality, acceptance, and understanding of the instructions. RESULTS: The survey was filled in by 45 (29.6%) participants. The mean rating of satisfaction was 4.70/5, and for intelligibility was 4.78/5. Thirty-seven (82.2%) patients declared that they had performed the exercises, all caregivers declared that it was possible to perform the proposed exercises a few times a week or daily, and only two respondents replied to invitations to individual online sessions. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from the study show that respiratory telerehabilitation may be implemented for DMD patients; however, the interest in digital rehabilitation among caregivers of DMD boys in Poland is low. The reasons for this situation require further research.","Sobierajska-Rek, Agnieszka; Manski, Lukasz; Jablonska-Brudlo, Joanna; Sledzinska, Karolina; Wasilewska, Eliza; Szalewska, Dominika",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,475

268301,Unknown Knowns,2020,"Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is considered a valuable research topic in the last few decades. Different types of machine learning models are used for this purpose, and this is a part of analyzing human behavior through machines. It is not a trivial task to analyze the data from wearable sensors for complex and high dimensions. Nowadays, researchers mostly use smartphones or smart home sensors to capture these data. In our paper, we analyze these data using machine learning models to recognize human activities, which are now widely used for many purposes such as physical and mental health monitoring. We apply different machine learning models and compare performances. We use Logistic Regression (LR) as the benchmark model for its simplicity and excellent performance on a dataset, and to compare, we take Decision Tree (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Additionally, we select the best set of parameters for each model by grid search. We use the HAR dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository as a standard dataset to train and test the models. Throughout the analysis, we can see that the Support Vector Machine performed (average accuracy 96.33%) far better than the other methods. We also prove that the results are statistically significant by employing statistical significance test methods.","Rabbi, Jakaria; Fuad, Md. Tahmid Hasan; Awal, Md.

We ask the question of whether there is a procedure, computable by hand, which can calculate the appropriate premium tax credit for any household with self-employment income. We motivate current IRS tax guidance, which has had self-employed taxpayers use a fixed point iteration to calculate their premium tax credits since 2014. Then, we give an example showing that the IRS iteration can lead to a divergent sequence of iterates. As a consequence, IRS guidance does not calculate appropriate premium tax credits for tax returns in certain income intervals, adversely affecting eligible beneficiaries. A bisection procedure for calculating premium tax credits is proposed. We prove that this procedure calculates appropriate premium tax credits for a model of simple tax returns. This is generalized to the case where premium tax credits are received in advance, which is the most common one in applications. We outline the problem of calculating appropriate premium tax credits for models of general tax returns. While the bisection procedure will work with the tax code in its current configuration, it could fail, eg, in states which have not expanded Medicaid, if a new deduction with certain properties were to arise.","Ferguson, Samuel J.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.03355v1.pdf,475

We aimed to describe the impact of COVID-19 on children's health, wellbeing, and access to medical care in Portugal. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study through an anonymous online survey via social media. The collected data refers to a period between the 16th of March and the 17th of May 2020. RESULTS: We obtained responses to the survey on 19 745 children. Of the previously scheduled outpatient consultations, 54.2% were postponed by healthcare institutions and 21.6% of planned vaccinations were missed. Parents expressed concerns regarding psychological, social, and physical consequences for their children due to the pandemic. DISCUSSION: The observed reduction of pediatric emergency department visits and the postponement of outpatient consultations and vaccine administrations are potentially harmful for non-COVID patients. The current pandemic and the imposed social distance might have an important negative impact on the mental health of children. CONCLUSION: Further studies are necessary to fully comprehend the outcomes of the decreased access to medical care, as well as the collateral damage for children beyond the clinical aspects of the pandemic. Defining strategies regarding the urge to vaccinate children and not postpone urgent evaluations should be a public health priority.","Poppe, Mariana; Aguiar, Bárbara; Sousa, Rodrigo; Oom, Paulo",Acta Med Port,,475

272200,Pandemic could mark 'turning point' for Chinese science,2021,"Wireless body area network (WBAN) is an emerging technology for remotely monitoring the critically affected patients regularly, which is a utility platform for a medical pandemic like COVID-19. IEEE 802.15.6 medium access control (MAC) defines the communication standard to pillar the quality requirements of the sensor nodes. Most of the existing works are focused on optimizing the conventional MAC by adopting dynamic scheduled access and efficient contention scheme to utilize the superframe structure. However, utilizing the entire slots based on demand from different priority sensor nodes is a challenging task. To address this issue, an efficient time slot allocation method, namely the demand-based dynamic slot allocation (DDSA) algorithm, is proposed. DDSA computes sensor node priority based on the run-time parameters such as critical index, remaining energy, and delivery demand. The slot assignment is proportional to the priority order, and the critical index factor resolves slot conflict. This guarantees data priority preservation with fair allocation for critical and non-critical medical data. The simulation is carried out using the Castalia-OMNeT++ simulator, and the results are shown that the proposed DDSA algorithm outperforms priority-based MAC and the conventional method in terms of packet reception rate, energy efficiency, and latency. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Justin Gopinath, A.; Nithya, B.","4th International Conference on Computing and Network Communications, CoCoNet 2020",,475

In addition, the recent COVID-19 outbreak has been creating challenges for various countries and their respective health care organizations in managing and controlling the pandemic. One of the most important observations during the recent outbreak is the lack of effective eHealth frameworks for managing and controlling pandemics. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study are to review the current National eHealth Strategy of Saudi Arabia and to propose an integrated eHealth framework that can be effective for managing health care operations and services during pandemics. METHODS: A questionnaire-based survey was administered to 316 health care professionals to review the current national eHealth framework of Saudi Arabia and identify the objectives, factors, and components that are key for managing and controlling pandemics. Purposive sampling was used to collect responses from diverse experts, including physicians, technical experts, nurses, administrative experts, and pharmacists. The survey was administered at five hospitals in Saudi Arabia by forwarding the survey link using a web-based portal. A sample population of 350 was achieved, which was filtered to exclude incomplete and ineligible samples, giving a sample of 316 participants. RESULTS: Of the 316 participants, 187 (59.2%) found the current eHealth framework to be ineffective, and more than 50% of the total participants stated that the framework lacked some essential components and objectives. Additional components and objectives focusing on using eHealth for managing information, creating awareness, increasing accessibility and reachability, promoting self-management and self-collaboration, promoting electronic services, and extensive stakeholder engagement were considered to be the most important factors by more than 80% of the total participants. CONCLUSIONS: Managing pandemics requires an effective and efficient eHealth framework that can be used to manage various health care services by integrating different eHealth components and collaborating with all stakeholders.","Alsharif, Abdullah",JMIR Med Inform,,475
287719,Neural Volume Rendering: NeRF And Beyond,2020-12-17,"Almost every dataset these days continually faces the predicament of class imbalance. It is difficult to train classifiers on these types of data as they become biased towards a set of classes, hence leading to reduction in classifier performance. This setback is often tackled by the use of various over-sampling or under-sampling algorithms. But, the method which stood out of all the numerous algorithms was the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE). SMOTE generates synthetic samples of the minority class by oversampling each data-point by considering linear combinations of existing minority class neighbors. Each minority data sample generates an equal number of synthetic data. As the world is suffering from the plight of COVID-19 pandemic, the authors applied the idea to help boost the classifying performance whilst detecting this deadly virus. This paper presents a modified version of SMOTE known as Outlier-SMOTE wherein each data-point is oversampled with respect to its distance from other data-points. The data-point which is farther than the other data-points is given more importance and is oversampled more than the others. Outlier-SMOTE reduces the chances of overlapping of minority data samples which often occurs in the traditional SMOTE algorithm. This method is tested on five benchmark datasets and are eventually tested on a COVID-19 dataset. F-measure, Recall and Precision are used as principle metrics to evaluate the performance of the classifier as is the case for any class imbalanced data set. The proposed algorithm performs considerably better than the traditional SMOTE algorithm for the considered datasets.","Kumar Turlapati, Venkata Pavan; Prusty, Manas Ranjan",Intell Based Med,,475
287916,BDD-Based Algorithm for SCC Decomposition of Edge-Coloured Graphs,2021-08-30,"BACKGROUND: Care homes are vulnerable to widespread transmission of severe acute respiratory coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with poor outcomes for staff and residents. Infection control interventions in care homes need to not only be effective in containing the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) but also feasible to implement in this special setting which is both a healthcare institution and a home. METHODS: We developed an agent-based model that simulates the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 via contacts between individuals, including residents, staff members, and visitors in a care home setting. We explored a representative care home in Scotland in our base case and explore other care home setups in an uncertainty analysis. We evaluated the effectiveness of a range of intervention strategies in controlling the spread of COVID-19. RESULTS: In the presence of the reference interventions that have been implemented in many care homes, including testing of new admissions, isolation of symptomatic residents, and restricted public visiting, routine testing of staff appears to be the most effective and practical approach. Routine testing of residents is no more effective as a reference strategy while routine testing of both staff and residents only shows a negligible additive effect. Modeling results are very sensitive to transmission probability per contact, but the qualitative finding is robust to varying parameter values in our uncertainty analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Our model predictions suggest that routine testing should target staff in care homes in conjunction with adherence to strict hand hygiene and using personal protective equipment to reduce risk of transmission per contact.","Nguyen, Le L K; Howick, Susan; McLafferty, Dennis; Anderson, Gillian H; Pravinkumar, Sahaya J; Van Der Meer, Robert; Megiddo, Itamar",Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,,475

Food systems are complex entities that affect diets, human health, and a range of other outcomes including economic growth, natural resource and environmental resiliency, and sociocultural factors. However, food systems contribute to and are vulnerable to ongoing climate and environmental changes that threaten their sustainability. Although there has been increased focus on this topic in recent years, many gaps in our knowledge persist on the relation between environmental factors, food systems, and nutritional outcomes.

289800,Arab nations first to approve Chinese COVID vaccine - despite lack of public data,2020,"Numerous clinical trials of mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSCs) as a new treatment for coronavirus-induced disease (COVID-19) have been registered recently, most of them based on intravenous (IV) infusion. There is no approved effective therapy for COVID-19, but MSC therapies have shown first promise in the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) pneumonia, inflammation, and sepsis, which are among the leading causes of mortality in COVID-19 patients. Many of the critically ill COVID-19 patients are in a hypercoagulable procoagulant state and at high risk for disseminated intravascular coagulation, thromboembolism, and thrombotic multi-organ failure, another cause of high fatality. It is not yet clear whether IV infusion is a safe and effective route of MSC delivery in COVID-19, since MSC-based products express variable levels of highly procoagulant tissue factor (TF/CD142), compromising the cells' hemocompatibility and safety profile. Of concern, IV infusions of poorly characterized MSC products with unchecked (high) TF/CD142 expression could trigger blood clotting in COVID-19 and other vulnerable patient populations and further promote the risk for thromboembolism. In contrast, well-characterized products with robust manufacturing procedures and optimized modes of clinical delivery hold great promise for ameliorating COVID-19 by exerting their beneficial immunomodulatory effects, inducing tissue repair and organ protection. While the need for MSC therapy in COVID-19 is apparent, integrating both innate and adaptive immune compatibility testing into the current guidelines for cell, tissue, and organ transplantation is critical for safe and effective therapies. It is paramount to only use well-characterized, safe MSCs even in the most urgent and experimental treatments. We here propose three steps to mitigate the risk for these vulnerable patients: (1) updated clinical guidelines for cell and tissue transplantation, (2) updated minimal criteria for characterization of cellular therapeutics, and (3) updated cell therapy routines reflecting specific patient needs.","Moll, Guido; Drzeniek, Norman; Kamhieh-Milz, Julian; Geissler, Sven; Volk, Hans-Dieter; Reinke, Petra",Front Immunol,,475

295736,Praktische Empfehlungen der Deutschen Diabetes Gesellschaft zum Diabetesmanagement bei Patientinnen und Patienten mit einer COVID-19-Erkrankung,2021,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are located in various tissues where these cells show niche-dependent multilineage differentiation and secrete immunomodulatory molecules to support numerous physiological processes. Due to their regenerative and reparative properties, MSCs are extremely valuable for cell-based therapy in tackling several pathological conditions including COVID-19. Iron is essential for MSC processes but iron-loading, which is common in several chronic conditions, hinders normal MSC functionality. This not only aggravates disease pathology but can also affect allogeneic and autologous MSC therapy. Thus, understanding MSCs from an iron perspective is of clinical significance. Accordingly, this review highlights the roles of iron and iron-related proteins in MSC physiology. It describes the contribution of iron and endogenous iron-related effectors like hepcidin, ferroportin, transferrin receptor, lactoferrin, lipocalin-2, bone morphogenetic proteins and hypoxia inducible factors in MSC biology. It summarises the excess-iron-induced alterations in MSC components, processes and discusses signalling pathways involving ROS, PI3K/AKT, MAPK, p53, AMPK/MFF/DRP1 and Wnt. Additionally, it evaluates the endogenous and exogenous saviours of MSCs against iron-toxicity. Lastly, it elaborates on the involvement of MSCs in the pathology of clinical conditions of iron-excess, namely, hereditary hemochromatosis, diabetes, ß-thalassaemia and myelodysplastic syndromes. This unique review integrates the distinct fields of iron regulation and MSC physiology. Through an iron-perspective, it describes both mechanistic and clinical aspects of MSCs and proposes an iron-linked MSC-contribution to physiology, pathology and therapeutics. It advances the understanding of MSC biology and may aid in identifying signalling pathways, molecular targets and compounds for formulating adjunctive iron-based therapies for excess-iron conditions, and thereby inform regenerative medicine.","Mehta, Kosha J",J. cell. physiol,,475

The purpose of this study was to investigate the feasibility of thermoplastic mask immobilization with a surgical mask using an ExacTrac system. Twelve patients each with brain metastases were immobilized using a thermoplastic mask and a surgical mask and only a thermoplastic mask. Two x-ray images were acquired to correct (XC) and verify (XV) the patient's position at a couch angle of 0°. Subsequently, the XC and XV images were acquired at each planned couch angle for non-coplanar beams. When the position errors were detected after couch rotation for non-coplanar beams, the errors were corrected at each planned couch angle until a clinically acceptable tolerance was attained. The position errors in the translational and rotational directions (vertical, lateral, longitudinal, pitch, roll, and yaw) were retrospectively investigated using data from the ExacTrac system database. A standard deviation of XC translational and rotational position errors with and without a surgical mask in the lateral (1.52 vs 2.07 mm), longitudinal (1.59 vs 1.87 mm), vertical (1.00 vs 1.73 mm), pitch (0.99 vs 0.79°), roll (1.24 vs 0.68°), and yaw (1.58 vs 0.90°) directions were observed at a couch angle of 0°. Most of patient positioning errors were less than 1.0 mm or 1.0° after the couch was rotated to the planned angle for non-coplanar beams. The overall absolute values of the translational and rotational XV position errors with and without the surgical mask were less than 0.5 mm and 0.5°, respectively. This study showed that a thermoplastic mask with a surgical mask is a feasible immobilization technique for brain SRS/SRT patients using the ExacTrac system.","Miura, Hideharu; Hioki, Kazunari; Ozawa, Shuichi; Kanemoto, Kenji; Nakao, Minoru; Doi, Yoshiko; Kenjo, Masahiko; Nagata, Yasushi",J. appl. clin. med. phys,,475

Its closest relative, SARS-CoV-1, has a slightly mutated Spike (S) protein, which interacts with ACE2 receptor in human cells to start the infection. So far, there are no vaccines or drugs to treat COVID-19. So, research groups worldwide are seeking new molecules targeting the S protein to prevent infection by SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 establishment. We performed molecular docking analysis of eight synthetic peptides against SARS-CoV-2 S protein. All interacted with the protein, but Mo-CBP3-PepII and PepKAA had the highest affinity with it. By binding to the S protein, both peptides led to conformational alterations in the protein, resulting in incorrect interaction with ACE2. Therefore, given the importance of the S protein-ACE2 interaction for SARS-CoV-2 infection, synthetic peptides could block SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, unlike other antiviral drugs, peptides have no toxicity to human cells. Thus, these peptides are potential molecules to be tested against SARS-CoV-2 and to develop new drugs to treat COVID-19.","Souza, Pedro F N; Lopes, Francisco E S; Amaral, Jackson L; Freitas, Cleverson D T; Oliveira, Jose T A",Int J Biol Macromol,,475
300244,"Lanxess AG, Germany",2020,"The current pandemic has introduced substantial uncertainty to traditional methods for demand planning. These uncertainties stem from the disease progression, government interventions, economy and consumer behavior. While most of the emerging literature on the pandemic has focused on disease progression, a few have focused on consequent regulations and their impact on individual behavior. The contributions of this paper include a quantitative behavior model of fear of COVID-19, impact of government interventions on consumer behavior, and impact of consumer behavior on consumer choice and hence demand for goods. It brings together multiple models for disease progression, consumer behavior and demand estimation-thus bridging the gap between disease progression and consumer demand. We use panel regression to understand the drivers of demand during the pandemic and Bayesian inference to simplify the regulation landscape that can help build scenarios for resilient demand planning. We illustrate this resilient demand planning model using a specific example of gas retailing. We find that demand is sensitive to fear of COVID-19: as the number of COVID-19 cases increase over the previous week, the demand for gas decreases -- though this dissipates over time. Further, government regulations restrict access to different services, thereby reducing mobility, which in itself reduces demand.","Hoda, Shaz; Singh, Amitoj; Rao, Anand; Ural, Remzi; Hodson, Nicholas",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.01036v1.pdf,475

301953,Environmental Engineers and Scientists Have Important Roles to Play in Stemming Outbreaks and Pandemics Caused by Enveloped Viruses,2020,"Consider a microphone array, such as those present in Amazon Echos, conference phones, or self-driving cars. One of the goals of these arrays is to decode the angles in which acoustic signals arrive at them. This paper considers the problem of estimating K angle of arrivals (AoA), i.e., the direct path's AoA and the AoA of subsequent echoes. Significant progress has been made on this problem, however, solutions remain elusive when the source signal is unknown (such as human voice) and the channel is strongly correlated (such as in multipath settings). Today's algorithms reliably estimate the direct-path-AoA, but the subsequent AoAs diverge in noisy real-world conditions. We design SubAoA, an algorithm that improves on the current body of work. Our core idea models signal in a new AoA sub-space, and employs a cancellation approach that successively cancels each AoA to decode the next. We explain the behavior and complexity of the algorithm from the first principles, simulate the performance across a range of parameters, and present results from real-world experiments. Comparison against multiple existing algorithms like GCC-PHAT, MUSIC, and VoLoc shows increasing gains for the latter AoAs, while our computation complexity allows real-time operation. We believe progress in multi-AoA estimation is a fundamental building block to various acoustic and RF applications, including human or vehicle localization, multi-user separation, and even (blind) channel estimation.","Wei, Yu-Lin; Choudhury, Romit Roy",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.13072v1.pdf,475

The prognostic value of GDF-15 in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is unknown. METHODS: Consecutive, hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and symptoms of COVID-19 were enrolled in the prospective, observational COVID Mechanisms Study. Biobank samples were collected at baseline, day 3 and day 9. The primary end point was admission to the intensive care unit or death during hospitalization, and the prognostic performance of baseline and serial GDF-15 concentrations were compared with that of established infectious disease and cardiovascular biomarkers. RESULTS: Of the 123 patients enrolled, 35 (28%) reached the primary end point; these patients were older, more often had diabetes, and had lower oxygen saturations and higher National Early Warning Scores on baseline. Baseline GDF-15 concentrations were elevated (>95th percentile in age-stratified healthy individuals) in 97 (79%), and higher concentrations were associated with detectable SARS-CoV-2 viremia and hypoxemia (both P<0.001). Patients reaching the primary end point had higher concentrations of GDF-15 (median, 4225 [IQR, 3197-5972] pg/mL versus median, 2187 [IQR, 1344-3620] pg/mL, P<0.001). The area under the receiver operating curve was 0.78 (95% CI, 0.70-0.86). The association between GDF-15 and the primary end point persisted after adjusting for age, sex, race, body mass index, estimated glomerular filtration rate, previous myocardial infarction, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation (P<0.001) and was superior and incremental to interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, ferritin, D-dimer, cardiac troponin T, and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide. Increase in GDF-15 from baseline to day 3 was also greater in patients reaching the primary end point (median, 1208 [IQR, 0-4305] pg/mL versus median, -86 [IQR, -322 to 491] pg/mL, P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: GDF-15 is elevated in the majority of patients hospitalized with COVID-19, and higher concentrations are associated with SARS-CoV-2 viremia, hypoxemia, and worse outcome.

Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging and cardiac catheterization showed long-distance ectasia of both coronary arteries after their origins and an origin stenosis of the right coronary artery with a perfusion defect. The patient was treated with oral anticoagulation together with antiplatelet therapy and remains under careful monitoring. Discussion: This rare case demonstrates that also patients with TGA after the arterial switch operation (ASO) can develop coronary artery dilatation in association with MIS-C. The most interesting finding in this patient was that the origins of the reimplanted coronary arteries were not dilated. We speculate that scar tissue formation in the area of coronary artery transfer after ASO has prevented proximal coronary artery dilation.","Sobh, M.; Jensen-Kondering, U.; Voges, I.; Boroni Grazioli, S.

308953,The hunt to find the coronavirus pandemic's patient zero,2020,"Clinical software has become a significant contribution to support clinical management and intra-hospital processes. In this regard, the success or failure of clinical software is mostly yielded on a suitable requirements elicitation process. Although several techniques and approaches address this process, the complexity of clinical services and the variety of clinicians involved in those services make it challenging to elicit requirements. To address this concern, in our previous work, we have proposed the D&I Framework. This collaborative technique translates clinical priorities into guidelines for eliciting software requirements in the healthcare context using implementation and dissemination strategies. This article evaluates the functionalities and tasks implemented in a clinical bed management system whose requirements were elicited using the D&I Framework. We focused on evaluating clinicians' usability expectation levels using a specific questionnaire executed in 2018 and 2020. The results show that, in comparison with the first release (2018) and the last one (2020), clinicians perceive an improvement in the functionalities and tasks implemented in the system. This study introduces the effects of implementation and dissemination strategies to elicit pragmatic clinical requirements.","M'arquez, Gast'on; Taramasco, Carla",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.12687v1.pdf,475

The diagnosis was based on the clinical picture of community-acquired pneumonia, data of chest multispiral computed tomography, and a positive test for COVID-19. ECG was recorded both in 3-6 and in 12 leads. Signs of right ventricular (RV) stress, so-called systolic overload (high R and inverted TV1-3 and TII, III, aVF), and diastolic overload (RV wall hypertrophy and cavity dilatation; complete or incomplete right bundle branch block) were evaluated.Results The most common signs for impaired functioning of the right heart include emergence of the RV P wave phase (41.3â%), incomplete right bundle branch block (42.6â%), ECG of the SIQâIIITIII type (33.3â%) typical for thromboembolic complications, and signs of RV hypertrophy, primarily increased SV5-6 (14.7â%). These changes are either associated with signs of RV myocardial stress (16â%) or appear on the background of signs for diffuse hypoxia evident as tall, positive, sharp-ended T waves in most leads (28â%).Conclusion A conclusive, comprehensive assessment of the reversal of hemodynamic disorders and electrocardiographic dynamics in patients with COVID-19 will be possible later, when more data become available.","Ryabykina, G V",Kardiologiia,,475

To address this, we investigated the effects of four masks (a surgical mask, N95 respirator, and two cloth masks) on recognition of spoken sentences in multi-talker babble. In low levels of background noise, masks had little to no effect, with no more than a 5.5% decrease in mean accuracy compared to a no-mask condition. In high levels of noise, mean accuracy was 2.8-18.2% lower than the no-mask condition, but the surgical mask continued to show no significant difference.

Comprehensive understanding of the pathogenesis of COVID-19-induced ARDS at the cellular and molecular levels is important for developing effective early preventive and therapeutic interventions. Sars-cov-2 utilizes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the surface of the host cell to gain its entry and, in the meantime, suppresses ACE2 expression and function. The decrease in available ACE2 results in excessive production of angiotensin II (Ang II), a potent Gq-linked agonist that can increase cytosolic Ca2+ concentration causing lung vascular endothelial cell barrier disruption, an essential early step in the pathogenesis of ARDS, ultimately leading to pulmonary edema and subsequent respiratory compromise. In the present study, we first established that pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVECs) possess a Ca2+/MLC2 (regulatory myosin light chain 2) signaling pathway that controls endothelial cell barrier function. Ionomycin, a potent Ca2+-selective ionophore, induced a rapid inter-EC gap formation along with a rapid, dose-dependent MLC2 phosphorylation in PMVECs. Chelation of extracellular Ca2+ or direct inhibition of MLC2 phosphorylation abolished the ionomycin-induced inter-EC gap formation. Next, we demonstrated that Ang II also induced inter-EC gap formation and a dose-dependent increase in MLC2 phosphorylation in PMVECs. Thus, Ang II may activate the Ca2+/MLC2 signaling pathway to disrupt lung microvascular endothelial barrier. These findings suggest a potential causative link between sars-cov-2 infection, Ca2+-dependent regulatory myosin light chain activation, and lung vascular endothelial barrier disruption in COVID-19-induced ARDS.","Zheng, Z.; Wang, Y.; Wang, X.; Wu, S.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,,475

In order to get a complete picture, there is a need to use patient generated data to track the long-term impact of COVID-19 on recovered patients in real time. There is a growing need to meticulously characterize these patients experiences, from infection to months post-infection, and with highly granular patient generated data rather than clinician narratives.

Identifying asymptomatic individuals early through serial testing is recommended to control COVID-19 in nursing homes, both in response to an outbreak (""outbreak testing"" of residents and healthcare personnel) and in facilities without outbreaks (""non-outbreak testing"" of healthcare personnel). The effectiveness of outbreak testing and isolation with or without non-outbreak testing was evaluated. METHODS: Using published SARS-CoV-2 transmission parameters, the fraction of SARS-CoV-2 transmissions prevented through serial testing (weekly, every three days, or daily) and isolation of asymptomatic persons compared to symptom-based testing and isolation was evaluated through mathematical modeling using a Reed-Frost model to estimate the percentage of cases prevented (i.e., ""effectiveness"") through either outbreak testing alone or outbreak plus non-outbreak testing. The potential effect of simultaneous decreases (by 10%) in the effectiveness of isolating infected individuals when instituting testing strategies was also evaluated. RESULTS: Modeling suggests that outbreak testing could prevent 54% (weekly testing with 48-hour test turnaround) to 92% (daily testing with immediate results and 50% relative sensitivity) of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Adding non-outbreak testing could prevent up to an additional 8% of SARS-CoV-2 infections (depending on test frequency and turnaround time). However, added benefits of non-outbreak testing were mostly negated if accompanied by decreases in infection control practice. CONCLUSIONS: When combined with high-quality infection control practices, outbreak testing could be an effective approach to preventing COVID-19 in nursing homes, particularly if optimized through increased test frequency and use of tests with rapid turnaround.","See, Isaac; Paul, Prabasaj; Slayton, Rachel B; Steele, Molly K; Stuckey, Matthew J; Duca, Lindsey; Srinivasan, Arjun; Stone, Nimalie; Jernigan, John A; Reddy, Sujan C",Clin. infect. dis,,475

Increasing age increases AAS as linear relation was detected between these variables (P = 0.011, Linear Regression). The questionnaire was also answered by 182 intern DPs (91% response-rate). No significant difference was detected between gender-groups (P = 0.378). Correlation was insignificant between age and AAS (P = 0.933). Conclusions: Occupation is the only variable influencing AAS of DPs. Academicians exhibited superior knowledge regarding SARS-CoV-2. The AASs of DPs and intern DPs were analogous.","Onoral, O; Caymaz, M G",Niger J Clin Pract,,475

Keeping social distancing is an essential public health measure to resist the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODOLOGY: a cross sectional study was conducted among 1,036 Egyptians using an online questionnaire between 5 and 10 May 2020. RESULTS: There was significant association between the practice of social distancing and some sociodemographic factors as sex, age, education, working status, and place of residence at p value < 0.001 and with community of residence at p value 0.021. CONCLUSIONS: Egyptians had good perception for social distancing to prevent transmission of COVID 19, but they were not strictly practicing it.","Bakry, Huny Mohamed; Waly, Eman Hassan",J Infect Dev Ctries,,475
341477,Towards NIR-VIS Masked Face Recognition,2021,"To date, drugs to attenuate cytokine storm in severe cases of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) are not available. In this study, we investigated the effects of intragastric and atomized administration of canagliflozin (CAN) on cytokine storm in lung tissues of lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced mice. Results showed that intragastric administration of CAN significantly and widely inhibited the production of inflammatory cytokines in lung tissues of LPS-induced sepsis mice. Simultaneously, intragastric administration of CAN significantly improved inflammatory pathological changes of lung tissues. Atomized administration of CAN also exhibited similar effects in LPS-induced sepsis mice. Furthermore, CAN significantly inhibited hypoxia inducible factor 1&#945; (HIF-1&#945;) and phosphofructokinase-2/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase 3 (PFKFB3) protein levels in LPS-treated lung tissues. These results indicated that CAN might attenuate cytokine storm and reduce the inflammatory symptoms in critical cases in COVID-19. Its action mechanism might involve the regulation of HIF-1&#945; and glycolysis in vivo. However, further studies about clinical application and mechanism analysis should be validated in the future.","Niu, Yaoyun; Chen, Yang; Sun, Pengbo; Wang, Yangyang; Luo, Jingyi; Ding, Yipei; Xie, Weidong",Int Immunopharmacol,,475
341533,Acoustical Slot Mode Sensor for the Rapid Coronaviruses Detection,2021,"Background: Stress is the physiological and psychological state which could overwhelmed an individual’s capacity to adequately respond to it. The coronavirus disease (COVID 19) outbreak in India had created a sudden shutdown of conventionally designed medical teaching, because of which the medical students were in a stage of dilemma. The new digital e-learning methods psychologically affected these students invariably. Aim and Objective: We hypothesized that significant stress was associated with non-use of digital online e-learning as well as lack of communication between teachers and students. Materials and Methods: After the institutional ethical clearance, this online survey study was done on medical students. A total of 924 students participated in the study. All the students voluntarily participated in the survey based on perceived stress scale (PSS) (ten items). The PSS-10 is used to compare the stress level in between Group I who was using digital e-learning methods and Group II who was not using digital e-learning methods. Results: The PSS-10 score was significantly high in the group who was not using digital online e-learning methods during this COVID 19 pandemic lockdown. Conclusion: The perception of perceived stress is high among the medical students who were not using online digital e-learning approaches. More research is needed to identify potential confounders.","Dwivedi, Deepti; Kaur, Nimarpreet; Shukla, Saurabh; Gandhi, Asha; Tripathi, Saurabh",Natl. J. Physiol. Pharm. Pharmacol.,,475

344102,Review of the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) based on current evidence,2020,"The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 causes the disease COVID-19, a severe acute respiratory syndrome. COVID-19 is now a global pandemic and public health emergency due to rapid human-to-human transmission. The impact is far-reaching, with enforced social distancing and isolation, detrimental effects on individual physical activity and mental wellbeing, education in the young and economic impact to business. Whilst most COVID-19 patients demonstrate mild-to-moderate symptoms, those with severe disease progression are at a higher risk of mortality. As more is learnt about this novel disease, it is becoming evident that comorbid cardiovascular disease is associated with a greater severity and increased mortality. Many patients positive for COVID-19 demonstrate increased concentrations of cardiac troponin, creating confusion in clinical interpretation. While myocardial infarction is associated with acute infectious respiratory disease, the majority of COVID-19 patients demonstrate stable cTn rather than the dynamically changing values indicative of an acute coronary syndrome. Although full understanding of the mechanism of cTn release in COVID-19 is currently lacking, this mini-review assesses the limited published literature with a view to offering insight to pathophysiological mechanisms and reported treatment regimens.","Gaze, David C",Ann Clin Biochem,,475

346249,Pandemic analysis of infection and death correlated with genomic open reading frame 10 mutation in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 victims,2021,"BACKGROUND: Differences between total deaths registered during the Covid-19 pandemic and those registered in a previous reference period is a valid measure of the pandemic effect. However, this does not consider demographic changes and temporal trends in mortality. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the excess mortality in 2020 in Italy considering demographic changes and temporal trends in mortality. METHODS: We used daily mortality and population data for the 2011-2019 period to estimate the expected deaths in 2020. Expected deaths were estimated, separately by sex, through an over-dispersed Poisson regression model including calendar year and age group as covariates, a smooth function of the year's week, and the logarithm of the population as offset. The difference between observed and expected deaths was considered a measure of excess mortality. RESULTS: In 2020, 746,146 deaths occurred in Italy. We estimated an excess mortality of 90,725 deaths (95% CI: 86,503-94,914), which became 99,289 deaths after excluding January and February, when mortality was lower than expected. The excess was higher among men (49,422 deaths) than women (41,303 deaths) and it was mostly detected at ages &#8805;80 (60,224 deaths) and ages 65-79 (25,791 deaths), while among the population aged 25-49 and 50-64 we estimated an excess of 281 and 4764 deaths, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: After considering demographic changes and temporal improvement in mortality the excess deaths in 2020 still remains above 90,000 deaths. More important, considering these factors, the excess at ages <80 years is revised upwards, while the excess at older ages is revised downwards.","Alicandro, Gianfranco; LA Vecchia, Carlo; Remuzzi, Giuseppe; Gerli, Alberto; Centanni, Stefano",Panminerva med,,475

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: To assess the rate at which an infectious disease can spread in a population, the 2 measures, R0 and Re or Rt, are widely used. One of the parameters which influence the calculations is the SI, the period between symptom onset in an infector and an infectee. METHODS: Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, and Science Direct searching up to May 10, 2020, was performed. A continuous random-effect model was applied using the DerSimonian-Laird (inverse variance) method. Heterogeneity and publication bias were assessed. RESULTS: A total of 39 articles met the eligibility criteria. Our results demonstrated the mean SI was 5.45 days, with the 95% confidence interval (CI) of 4.23 to 6.66. Pooled estimates for reproduction rates was 3.14 (95% CI: 2.69-3.59) for R0 and 3.18 (95% CI: 2.89-3.47) for Rt. Subgroup analysis by geographical region and date of publication revealed variations over both time and geography in calculated R0 and Rt values. As time has progressed, predicted R0 and Rt values had decreased globally. CONCLUSIONS: The study findings indicate that one SARS-CoV-2-infected person is likely to infect 3 persons, supporting that COVID-19 is a highly contagious disease. As an essential objective metrics implied in risk assessment for this emerging pandemic, monitoring R0 and Re is necessary to indicate the effectiveness or failures of mitigation efforts.","Hussein, Mohammad; Toraih, Eman; Elshazli, Rami; Fawzy, Manal; Houghton, August; Tatum, Danielle; Killackey, Mary; Kandil, Emad; Duchesne, Juan",Ann. surg,,475

The current study investigated SARS-CoV-2 viral load, biodistribution and anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody formation in patients suffering from severe corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). METHODS: This is a retrospective single-center study in 23 patients with COVID-19-induced ARDS. Data were collected within routine intensive care. SARS-CoV-2 viral load was assessed via reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Overall, 478 virology samples were taken. Anti-SARS-CoV-2-Spike-receptor binding domain (RBD) antibody detection of blood samples was performed with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: Most patients (91%) suffered from severe ARDS during ICU treatment with a 30-day mortality of 30%. None of the patients received antiviral treatment. Tracheal aspirates tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in 100% of the cases, oropharyngeal swabs only in 77%. Blood samples were positive in 26% of the patients. No difference of viral load was found in tracheal or blood samples with regard to 30-day survival or disease severity. SARS-CoV-2 was never found in dialysate. Serologic testing revealed significantly lower concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing IgM and IgA antibodies in survivors compared to non-survivors (p = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 induced ARDS is accompanied by a high viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in tracheal aspirates, which remained detectable in the majority throughout intensive care treatment. Remarkably, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was never detected in dialysate even in patients with RNAemia. Viral load or the buildup of neutralizing antibodies was not associated with 30-day survival or disease severity.","Schlesinger, Tobias; Weißbrich, Benedikt; Wedekink, Florian; Notz, Quirin; Herrmann, Johannes; Krone, Manuel; Sitter, Magdalena; Schmid, Benedikt; Kredel, Markus; Stumpner, Jan; Dölken, Lars; Wischhusen, Jörg; Kranke, Peter; Meybohm, Patrick; Lotz, Christopher",PLoS One,,475

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The study analyzed demographic information of patients with type 1 diabetes seen between 1 January 2018 and 30 June 2020 at a single center. We compared the odds of completing a visit via telemedicine across multiple demographic characteristics. RESULTS: Among 28,977 patient visits, the odds of completing a visit via telemedicine were lower among non-English-speaking (1.7% vs. 2.7%; adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.45, 95% CI 0.26-0.79) and Medicaid-insured (32.0% vs. 35.9%; aOR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72-0.95) pediatric patients. No clinically significant differences were observed for other demographic factors. CONCLUSIONS: Rapid transition to telemedicine did not significantly impact access to diabetes care for most demographic groups. However, disparities in access to care for historically marginalized groups merit close attention to ensure that use of telemedicine does not exacerbate these inequities.","Tilden, Daniel R; Datye, Karishma A; Moore, Daniel J; French, Benjamin; Jaser, Sarah S",Diabetes care,,475

In response, we developed LIFT, a mobile app-based mindfulness intervention. LIFT reduced distress symptoms more than either a telephone-based mindfulness program or education control in a pilot randomized clinical trial (LIFT1). OBJECTIVE: To describe the methods of a factorial experimental clinical trial (LIFT2) being conducted to aid in the development and implementation of the version of the LIFT intervention that is optimized across domains of effect, feasibility, scalability, and costs. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The LIFT2 study is an optimization trial conceptualized as a component of a larger multiphase optimization strategy (MOST) project. The goal of LIFT2 is to use a 2 × 2 × 2 factorial experimental trial involving 152 patients to determine the ideal components of the LIFT mobile mindfulness program for ICU survivors across factors including (1) study introduction by call from a therapist vs. app only, (2) response to persistent or worsening symptoms over time by therapist vs. app only, and (3) high dose vs. low dose. The primary trial outcome is change in depression symptoms 1 month from randomization measured by the PHQ-9 instrument. Secondary outcomes include anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, and physical symptoms; measures of feasibility, acceptability, and usability; as well as themes assessed through qualitative analysis of semi-structured interviews with study participants conducted after follow up completion. We will use general linear models to compare outcomes across the main effects and interactions of the factors.","Cox, Christopher E; Olsen, Maren K; Gallis, John A; Porter, Laura S; Greeson, Jeffrey M; Gremore, Tina; Frear, Allie; Ungar, Anna; McKeehan, Jeffrey; McDowell, Brittany; McDaniel, Hannah; Moss, Marc; Hough, Catherine L",Contemp Clin Trials,,475

We report the fundamental pathological investigation in the lungs and other organs of fatal cases for the mechanistic understanding of severe COVID-19 and the development of specific therapy in these cases. METHODS: The autopsy and pathological investigations of specimens were performed on bodies of two deceased cases with COVID-19. Gross anatomy and histological investigation by Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) stained were reviewed on each patient. Alcian blue/periodic acid-Schiff (AB-PAS) staining and Masson staining were performed for the examinations of mucus, fibrin and collagen fiber in lung tissues. Immunohistochemical staining was performed on the slides of lung tissues from two patients. Real-time PCR was performed to detect the infection of SARS-CoV-2. Flow cytometry analyses were performed to detect the direct binding of S protein and the expression of ACE2 on the cell surface of macrophages. FINDINGS: The main pathological features in lungs included extensive impairment of type I alveolar epithelial cells and atypical hyperplasia of type II alveolar cells, with formation of hyaline membrane, focal hemorrhage, exudation and pulmonary edema, and pulmonary consolidation. The mucous plug with fibrinous exudate in the alveoli and the dysfunction of alveolar macrophages were characteristic abnormalities. The type II alveolar epithelial cells and macrophages in alveoli and pulmonary hilum lymphoid tissue were infected by SARS-CoV-2. S protein of SARS-CoV-2 directly bound to the macrophage via the S-protein-ACE2 interaction. INTERPRETATION: Infection of alveolar macrophage by SARS-CoV-2 might be drivers of the ""cytokine storm"", which might result in damages in pulmonary tissues, heart and lung, and lead to the failure of multiple organs .

362360,How I managed my work and personal life as a sole parent during the pandemic,2020,"The ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, which was officially declared by the World Health Organization. SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the family Coronaviridae that consists of a group of enveloped viruses with single-stranded RNA genome, which cause diseases ranging from common colds to acute respiratory distress syndrome. Although the major transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2 are inhalation of aerosol/droplet and person-to-person contact, currently available evidence indicates that the viral RNA is present in wastewater, suggesting the need to better understand wastewater as potential sources of epidemiological data and human health risks. Here, we review the current knowledge related to the potential of wastewater surveillance to understand the epidemiology of COVID-19, methodologies for the detection and quantification of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater, and information relevant for human health risk assessment of SARS-CoV-2. There has been growing evidence of gastrointestinal symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-2 infections and the presence of viral RNA not only in feces of infected individuals but also in wastewater. One of the major challenges in SARS-CoV-2 detection/quantification in wastewater samples is the lack of an optimized and standardized protocol. Currently available data are also limited for conducting a quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) for SARS-CoV-2 exposure pathways. However, modeling-based approaches have a potential role to play in reducing the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Furthermore, QMRA parameters obtained from previous studies on relevant respiratory viruses help to inform risk assessments of SARS-CoV-2. Our understanding on the potential role of wastewater in SARS-CoV-2 transmission is largely limited by knowledge gaps in its occurrence, persistence, and removal in wastewater. There is an urgent need for further research to establish methodologies for wastewater surveillance and understand the implications of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater.","Kitajima, Masaaki; Ahmed, Warish; Bibby, Kyle; Carducci, Annalaura; Gerba, Charles P; Hamilton, Kerry A; Haramoto, Eiji; Rose, Joan B",Sci Total Environ,,475

364376,Distributed Optimization Design for Computation of Algebraic Riccati Inequalities,2020,"In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, as with other countries across the world, the Central and State Governments of India initiated several measures to slow down the spread of the virus and to 'flatten the curve'. One such measure was a 'total lockdown' for several weeks across the country. A complex and unexpected outcome of the lockdown which has medical, ethical, economic, and social dimensions is related to alcohol consumption. The lockdown and consequent acute non-availability of alcohol resulted in people with alcohol dependence going into withdrawals, black marketing of alcohol, and in extreme cases suicide resulting from the alleged frustration of not having access to alcohol. The health dilemmas around this situation are biological (e.g. pushing people into risky situations-potentially fatal alcohol withdrawal, consumption of illicit or other non-consumable alcohol) and psychosocial (e.g. isolation increasing the risk of relapses, loss of control over the decision to abstain which can be detrimental to recovery, restriction of access to services for alcohol problems). The legal and rights-related dilemmas are centred around whether States have the right to impinge on individual autonomy on the grounds of public health, the capacity of the health systems to provide appropriate services to cope with those who will struggle with the unavailability of alcohol, the constitutionality of the Central government's impinging on jurisdiction of states under the guise of a health emergency caused by the pandemic, and the ability of the State to make unbiased decisions about this issue when it is highly dependent on the revenue from the sale of alcohol and associated industries. The way forward could be a pragmatic and utilitarian approach involving continued access to alcohol, while observing all physical distancing norms necessary during the pandemic, for those who want to continue drinking; and implementing innovative measures such as tele-counselling for those who wish not to return back to drinking.","Nadkarni, Abhijit; Kapoor, Arjun; Pathare, Soumitra",Int J Law Psychiatry,,475

The current study aimed to explore nurses' ethics in the care of patients during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. A descriptive qualitative approach was adopted in order to gain an in-depth understanding of nurses' experiences of caring for patients with coronavirus. A purposive sample of 10 nurses working with patients with COVID-19 was recruited. Interviews were held with the nurses, and content analysis of the interviews was conducted. Each interview was transcribed, and the text was coded into manageable categories on the word, word sense, phrase, sentence, and theme levels before analysis. Three major themes related to the nurses' ethical commitments during the COVID-19 crisis emerged during the data analysis. These themes are as follows: the obligation of nurses to provide care for patients regardless of their medical diagnosis;the ethical dilemma faced by nurses of whether to care for patients or protect themselves from the virus;and finally, the responsibility of nurses to care for themselves.","Alloubani, A.; Khater, W.; Akhu-Zaheya, L.; Almomani, M.; Alashram, S.",Frontiers in Medicine,,475

371538,The PD-1/PD-L1-Checkpoint Restrains T cell Immunity in Tumor-Draining Lymph Nodes,2020,"Pro-inflammatory cytokines like interleukin-1ß (IL-1ß) are upregulated during early responses to tissue damage and are expected to transiently compromise the mechanical microenvironment. Fibroblasts are key regulators of tissue mechanics in the lungs and other organs. However, the effects of IL-1ß on fibroblast mechanics and functions remain unclear. Here we treated human pulmonary fibroblasts from control donors with IL-1ß and used Atomic Force Microscopy to unveil that IL-1ß significantly reduces the stiffness of fibroblasts concomitantly with a downregulation of filamentous actin (F-actin) and alpha-smooth muscle (&#945;-SMA). Likewise, COL1A1 mRNA was reduced, whereas that of collagenases MMP1 and MMP2 were upregulated, favoring a reduction of type-I collagen. These mechanobiology changes were functionally associated with reduced proliferation and enhanced migration upon IL-1ß stimulation, which could facilitate lung repair by drawing fibroblasts to sites of tissue damage. Our observations reveal that IL-1ß may reduce local tissue rigidity by acting both intracellularly and extracellularly through the downregulation of fibroblast contractility and type I collagen deposition, respectively. These IL-1ß-dependent mechanical effects may enhance lung repair further by locally increasing pulmonary tissue compliance to preserve normal lung distension and function. Moreover, our results support that IL-1ß provides innate anti-fibrotic protection that may be relevant during the early stages of lung repair.","Gabasa, Marta; Arshakyan, Marselina; Llorente, Alejandro; Chuliá-Peris, Lourdes; Pavelescu, Irina; Xaubet, Antoni; Pereda, Javier; Alcaraz, Jordi",Int. j. mol. sci.

The disease has been spreading rapidly across the globe, with the largest burden falling on China, Europe, and the United States. COVID-19 is a new clinical syndrome, characterized by respiratory symptoms with varying degrees of severity, from mild upper respiratory illness to severe interstitial pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, aggravated by thrombosis in the pulmonary microcirculation. Three main phases of disease progression have been proposed for COVID-19: an early infection phase, a pulmonary phase, and a hyperinflammation phase. Although current understanding of COVID-19 treatment is mainly derived from small uncontrolled trials that are affected by a number of biases, strong background noise, and a litany of confounding factors, emerging awareness suggests that drugs currently used to treat COVID-19 (antiviral drugs, antimalarial drugs, immunomodulators, anticoagulants, and antibodies) should be evaluated in relation to the pathophysiology of disease progression. Drawing upon the dramatic experiences taking place in Italy and around the world, here we review the changes in the evolution of the disease and focus on current treatment uncertainties and promising new therapies.","Romagnoli, Stefano; Peris, Adriano; De Gaudio, A Raffaele; Geppetti, Pierangelo",Physiol Rev,,475

The majority of infected people presents flu like symptoms and among them 15-20% develops a severe interstitial pneumonitis (IP) that may eventually evolve in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). IP is caused by the viral glycoprotein spike (S) binding to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expressed on the surface of alveolar pneumocytes. The virus is recognized by the ""pattern recognition receptors"" (PRR) of the immune cells that release cytokines activating more immune cells that produce a large number of pro-inflammatory cytokines, tissue factors and vasoactive peptides. Affected patients might develop the ""cytokine storm syndrome,"" a fulminant and fatal hypercytokinaemia with multiorgan failure. In patients infected by SARS-COv-2 increase in T-helper 2 (TH2) cytokines (IL-4 and IL10) are reported in addition to the T-helper 1 (TH1) cytokines (IL1B, IFNÎ³, IP10, and MCP1) previously detected in other coronavirus infections. Cytokines and other molecules involved in immune response and inflammation are conceivable therapeutic targets for IP and ARDS, improving symptoms and decreasing intensive care unit admissions. To this aim off label drugs may be used taking into consideration the window timing for immunosuppressive drugs in virus infected patients. Some off label therapeutic options and preclinical evidence drugs are herein considered.","Scala, Stefania; Pacelli, Roberto",Front Immunol,,475

Turn out in this election was ten percentage points lower than in the general elections that were held a year earlier. The paper draws on a nationally representative survey of adult Malawians (n = 1155). In our main analysis, we use instrumental variables to account for potential endogeneity. We find that nearly two thirds of Malawians thought that they were likely to catch COVID-19 at some point. Notwithstanding the COVID-19 risk, 86% of the country's citizens were willing to vote. Our analysis shows that an individual's perceived risk of catching COVID-19 is associated with a lower likelihood of voting (ß = - 0.096; p < 0.05). This suggests that voter turnout in Malawi's fresh presidential election may have been highly affected by the perceived risk of catching COVID-19. The policy implication is that instituting and enforcing primary preventive measures may help reduce the perceived risk of catching COVID-19 and mitigate voter apathy.","Chirwa, Gowokani Chijere; Dulani, Boniface; Sithole, Lonjezo; Chunga, Joseph J; Alfonso, Witness; Tengatenga, John",Eur J Dev Res,,475

382333,COVID-19 detection in radiological text reports integrating entity recognition,2020,"Introduction Late-life depression (LLD) is associated with psychiatric comorbidities that may worsen mood outcomes in older adults, yet the neural mechanisms that underlie these comorbid conditions remain understudied Anxiety and neuroticism have been independently associated with LLD, and its mood and cognitive outcomes In a preliminary behavioral data analysis we found that anxiety measures correlated with depression measures in older adults We also found that several baseline neuroticism and anxiety traits predicted depression scores over time In this study, we analyzed neuroimaging data in the setting of anxiety and neuroticism measures in LLD and hypothesized that there would be differences in resting state activity patterns in the Salience network (SN), Default-Mode network (DMN) and Executive Control network (ECN) related to severity of: (1) generalized anxiety, (2) state and trait anxiety, and (3) neuroticism Methods This was a cross-sectional secondary data analysis on clinical and MRI data collected from our NBOLD project LLD patients without dementia were included Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) symptoms, state and trait anxiety, neuroticism and depression were assessed using a GAD questionnaire, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), NEO Personality Inventory (NEO PI), and Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), respectively A study psychiatrist confirmed or ruled out diagnosis of depression There were 102 older adults with LLD, and among them, 87 subjects who had measures of STAI-trait, STAI-state anxiety, GAD symptoms and neuroticism as well as usable neuroimaging data were included into our final analyses The neuroimaging data was collected from 3T Siemens Skyra scanner The imaging parameters for T1-weighted images were: TR/TE=2200/2 8ms, flip angle=13o, matrix = 256 × 256 × 169, Voxelsize=1×1×1mm3 The 7-min resting-state fMRI data was collected using EPI sequence with FOV=240mm, flip angle=90o, TR/TE=2000/31ms, matrix=64×64×34, voxelsize = 3 8×3 8×3 75mm3 The fMRI data was preprocessed using the default protocol setting recommend by DPABI software The Amplitude of Low-Frequency Fluctuations (ALFF) was calculated using DPABI Multiple regression model was used to examine the association between ALFF and GAD, state and trait anxiety as well as neuroticism controlled for age, gender and depression severity (MADRS) using SPM12 Significance was set at p&lt;0 05 with FDR correction for multiple comparisons Results Data analyses revealed that trait anxiety was positively correlated with greater ALFF in the ECN (left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex - dlPFC, bilateral inferior parietal cortex - IPS, and precuneus) and lateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) Higher state anxiety was correlated with lower ALFF in bilateral OFC and frontal pole GAD symptom severity was positively correlated with ALFF in the right superior temporal cortex (STG), Heschl's gyrus, and dorsomedial frontal cortex (dMFC) The GAD symptom severity was also negatively correlated with ALFF in the right hippocampus, parahippocampus and temporal pole (TP), whereas there was no significant clusters found between ALFF and neuroticism after regressing out the covariates Conclusions This is one the few studies that examined resting state neural oscillation pattern (ALFF) specific to state and trait anxiety and GAD symptoms in LLD Higher trait anxiety was associated with greater ALFF in the ECN and OFC, all of which are related to emotion regulation, whereas higher state anxiety was correlated with lower ALFF in regions related to emotion regulation Higher GAD was specifically correlated with higher ALFF in brain regions related to sound and social information processing, but with lower ALFF in regions related to memory No significant clusters were found related to neuroticism suggesting that neuroticism might be able explained by trait and state anxiety as well as GAD These results suggests a distinct neural construct that may distinguish state and trait anxiety in LLD Uncovering the brain connectivity changes related to state and trait anxiety would deepen our understanding in the neural mechanisms and mood outcomes of LLD Future studies are needed to determine differences in these networks between depressed and non-depressed individuals Funding The Leo and Anne Albert Charitable Trust, National Institute of Mental Health Grant R01 MH108578, The University of Connecticut Department of Psychiatry","Cuevas, Elisa Gonzalez Wu Rong Manning Kevin Wang Lihong Steffens David",The American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry,,475

We examine how different definitions and thresholds of vaccine efficacy, coupled with different levels of implementation effectiveness and background epidemic severity, translate into outcomes including cumulative infections, hospitalizations, and deaths. Using a mathematical simulation of vaccination, we find that factors related to implementation will contribute more to the success of vaccination programs than a vaccine's efficacy as determined in clinical trials. The benefits of a vaccine will decline substantially in the event of manufacturing or deployment delays, significant vaccine hesitancy, or greater epidemic severity. Our findings demonstrate the urgent need for health officials to invest greater financial resources and attention to vaccine production and distribution programs, to redouble efforts to promote public confidence in COVID-19 vaccines, and to encourage continued adherence to other mitigation approaches, even after a vaccine becomes available.

384424,Controlling Coronavirus Will Mean Keeping People Apart : China Has an APP for That. The Rest of the World Needs a Plan,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Through the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, telemedicine became a necessary entry point into the process of diagnosis, triage and treatment. Racial and ethnic disparities in health care have been well documented in COVID-19 with respect to risk of infection and in-hospital outcomes once admitted, and here we assess disparities in those who access healthcare via telemedicine for COVID-19 . MATERIALS AND METHODS: Electronic health record data of patients at New York University Langone Health between March 19th and April 30, 2020 were used to conduct descriptive and multilevel regression analyses with respect to visit type (telemedicine or in-person), suspected COVID diagnosis and COVID test results. RESULTS: Controlling for individual and community-level attributes, Black patients had 0.6 times the adjusted odds (95%CI:0.58-0.63) of accessing care through telemedicine compared to white patients, though they are increasingly accessing telemedicine for urgent care, driven by a younger and female population. COVID diagnoses were significantly more likely for Black versus white telemedicine patients. DISCUSSION: There are disparities for Black patients accessing telemedicine, however increased uptake by young, female Black patients. Mean income and decreased mean household size of Zip code were also significantly related to telemedicine use. CONCLUSION: Telemedicine access disparities reflect those in in-person healthcare access. Roots of disparate use are complex and reflect individual, community, and structural factors, including their intersection; many of which are due to systemic racism. Evidence regarding disparities that manifest through telemedicine can be used to inform tool design and systemic efforts to promote digital health equity.","Chunara, Rumi; Zhao, Yuan; Chen, Ji; Lawrence, Katharine; Testa, Paul A; Nov, Oded; Mann, Devin M",J. am. med. inform. assoc,,475

In this work, we aimed to evaluate the immunomodulatory effects of D. pigrum 040417 in human respiratory epithelial cells and the potential ability of this immunobiotic bacterium to increase the protection against Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The respiratory commensal bacterium D. pigrum 040417 differentially modulated the production of IFN-β, IL-6, CXCL8, CCL5 and CXCL10 in the culture supernatants of Calu-3 cells stimulated with poly(I:C) or challenged with SARS-CoV-2. The differential cytokine profile induced by the 040417 strain was associated with a significant reduction in viral replication and cellular damage after coronavirus infection. Of note, D. pigrum 030918 was not able to modify the resistance of Calu-3 cells to SARS-CoV-2 infection, indicating a strain-specific immunomodulatory effect for respiratory commensal bacteria. The findings of this work improve our understanding of the immunological mechanisms involved in the modulation of respiratory immunity induced by respiratory commensal bacteria, by demonstrating their specific effect on respiratory epithelial cells. In addition, the results suggest that particular strains such as D. pigrum 040417 could be used as a promising alternative for combating SARS-CoV-2 and reducing the severity of COVID-19.","Islam, Md.

In here, exploiting a large panel of publicly available genome-wide data, we investigated whether the human receptor ACE2 and human proteases TMPRSS2, FURIN and CATHEPSINs (B, L and V), which are involved in SARS-CoV-2 cell entry, are transcriptionally regulated by environmental cues. We report that more than 50 chemicals modulate the expression of ACE2 or human proteases important for SARS-CoV-2 cell entry. We further demonstrate that transcription factor AhR, which is commonly activated by pollutants, binds to the promoter of TMPRSS2 and enhancers and/or promoters of Cathepsin B, L and V encoding genes. Our exploratory study documents an influence of environmental exposures on the expression of genes involved in SARS-CoV-2 cell entry. These results could be conceptually and medically relevant to our understanding of the COVID-19 disease, and should be further explored in laboratory and epidemiologic studies.","Watzky, Manon; de Dieuleveult, Maud; Letessier, Anne; Saint-Ruf, Claude; Miotto, Benoit",Environ Res,,475
388595,Die zweite Welle,2020,"The delivery of bioactive molecules (drugs) with control over spatial distribution remains a challenge. Herein, we demonstrate for the first time an electrofluidic approach to controlled delivery into soft tissue models based on gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) hydrogels. This was achieved using a surgical suture, whereby transport of bioactive molecules, including drugs and proteins, was controlled by imposition of an electric field. Commonly employed surgical sutures or acrylic threads were integrated through the hydrogels to facilitate the directed introduction of bioactive species. The platform consisted of two reservoirs into which the ends of the thread were immersed. The anode and cathode were placed separately into each reservoir. The thread was taken from one reservoir to the other through the gel. When current was applied, biomolecules loaded onto the thread were directed into the gel. Under the same conditions, the rate of movement of the biomolecules along GelMA was dependent on the magnitude of the current. Using 5% GelMA and a current of 100 µA, 2 uL of fluorescein travelled through the hydrogel at a constant velocity of 7.17 ± 0.50 um/s and took less than 8 minutes to exit on the thread. Small molecules such as riboflavin migrated faster (5.99 ± 0.40 µm/s) than larger molecules such as dextran (2.26 ± 0.55 µm/s with 4 kDa) or BSA (0.33 ± 0.07 µm/s with 66.5 kDa). A number of commercial surgical sutures were tested and found to accommodate the controlled movement of biomolecules. Polyester, polyglactin 910, glycolide/lactide copolymer and polyglycolic acid braided sutures created adequate fluid connection between the electrodes and the hydrogel. With a view to application in skin inflammatory diseases and wound treatment, wound healing, slow and controlled delivery of dexamethasone 21-phosphate disodium salt (DSP), an anti-inflammatory prodrug, was achieved using medical surgicryl PGA absorbable suture. After 2 hours of electrical stimulation, still 81.1% of the drug loaded was encapsulated within the hydrogel.","Cabot, Joan M; Daikuara, Luciana Y; Yue, Zhilian; Hayes, Patricia; Liu, Xiao; Wallace, Gordon G; Paull, Brett",Sci Rep,,475

The COVID-19 pandemic has played serious havoc on economic activities throughout the world. Researchers are immensely curious about how to give the best protection to people before a vaccine becomes available. The coronavirus spreads principally through saliva droplets. Thus, it would be a great opportunity if the virus spread could be controlled at an early stage. The face mask can limit virus spread from both inside and outside the mask. This is the first study that has endeavoured to explore the design and fabrication of an antiviral face mask using licorice root extract, which has antimicrobial properties due to glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) and glycyrrhizin (GL). An electrospinning process was utilized to fabricate nanofibrous membrane and virus deactivation mechanisms discussed. The nanofiber mask material was characterized by SEM and airflow rate testing. SEM results indicated that the nanofibers from electrospinning are about 15-30 µm in diameter with random porosity and orientation which have the potential to capture and kill the virus. Theoretical estimation signifies that an 85 L/min rate of airflow through the face mask is possible which ensures good breathability over an extensive range of pressure drops and pore sizes. Finally, it can be concluded that licorice root membrane may be used to produce a biobased face mask to control COVID-19 spread.","Chowdhury, Mohammad Asaduzzaman; Shuvho, Md Bengir Ahmed; Shahid, Md Abdus; Haque, A K M Monjurul; Kashem, Mohammod Abul; Lam, Su Shiung; Ong, Hwai Chyuan; Uddin, Md Alhaz; Mofijur, M",Environ Res,,475
391303,New From CPD Online,2021,"Rotavirus infection is the leading cause of acute diarrhea in children and is preventable with a vaccine. Malnutrition increases the risk for the development of enteric and respiratory diseases, but also diarrhea increases the risk for stunting, having a negative effect in height-for-age Z score (HAZ). Therefore, Rotavirus can be considered as one of the contributing factors to stunting. The objective was to determine if vaccination against rotavirus was associated with changes in HAZ of children aged 6-60 months. We analyzed the data of Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) 2015-2017 for Peru, which is a nationwide representative. We fitted linear regression models controlling for complex sampling. The vaccine coverage was close to 75.5%, and the mean HAZ was -0.76 standard deviations. After adjusting by demographic, health, and household characteristics, children who received rotavirus vaccine, had a mean HAZ 0.06 standard deviations higher than children who did not receive it. Additionally, BCG vaccination, a higher education level of the mother, a higher wealth index, and treating water for drinking were positively associated with HAZ. On the other hand, we found low birth weight, lack of flush toilet, and altitude higher than 2500 m above sea level negatively associated with HAZ.

DESIGN: Single-center, prospective, randomized study. SETTING: Holding area and operating room at a single-center tertiary care hospital. PARTICIPANTS: The study comprised 22 American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status 3 or 4 patients with severe cardiac disease undergoing S-ICD implantation. INTERVENTIONS: Patients received either a combination of serratus anterior plane block and transversus thoracis plane block or surgical infiltration of local anesthetics. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Perioperative analgesic medication in the fascial plane block group versus the surgical wound infiltration group, visual analog pain scale score (0-10), intraoperative vital signs, total procedure time, and length of stay in the intensive care unit were measured. Total intraoperative fentanyl requirements (µg) were significantly less in the truncal block group versus the surgical infiltration group (45 [25-50] v 90 [50-100]; pâ¯=â¯0.026), and no patients had any adverse sequelae related to the study. Median intraoperative propofol use in the surgical infiltration group was 66.48 (47.30-73.73) µg/kg/min, and 65.95 (51.86-104.86) µg/kg/min for the truncal block group. This difference between the groups was not statistically significant (pâ¯=â¯0.293). CONCLUSIONS: The performance of both the serratus anterior plane block and transversus thoracis plane blocks for S-ICD implantation are appropriate and may have the benefit of decreasing intraoperative opioid requirements.","Shariat, Ali; Ghia, Samit; Gui, Jane L; Gallombardo, Joseph; Bracker, Joseph; Lin, Hung-Mo; Mohammad, Asad; Mehta, Davendra; Bhatt, Himani",J. cardiothoracic vasc. anest,,475

400449,Canine arthritis management and the new norm,2021,"The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic shows a marked geographical variation in its prevalence and mortality. The question arises if the host genetic variation may (partly) affect the prevalence and mortality of COVID-19. We postulated that the geographical variation of human polymorphisms might partly explain the variable prevalence of the infection. We investigated some candidate genes that have the potential to play a role in the immune defense against COVID-19: complement component 3 (C3), galactoside 2-alpha-L-fucosyltransferase 2 (FUT2), haptoglobin (Hp), vitamin D binding protein (DBP), human homeostatic iron regulator protein (HFE), cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), and angiotensin-converting enzyme 1 (ACE1). In a univariate approach, ACE1 D/I, C3, CFTR, and HFE polymorphisms correlated significantly with COVID-19 prevalence/mortality, whereas Hp and FUT2 polymorphism did not show any significant correlations. In a multivariate analysis, only ACE1 D/I and C3 polymorphisms were determinants for COVID-19 prevalence/mortality. The other polymorphisms (CFTR, DBP, FUT2, HFE, and Hp) did not correlate with COVID-19 prevalence/mortality. Whereas ACE1 D/I polymorphism shows functional links with ACE2 (which is the receptor for the virus) in COVID-19, C3 can act as a critical step in the virus-induced inflammation. Our findings plead against a bystander role of the polymorphisms as a marker for historical migrations, which comigrate with causal genes involved in COVID-19 infection. Further studies are required to assess the clinical outcome of COVID-19 in C3S and ACE1 D allele carriers and to study the role of C3 and ACE1 D/I polymorphisms in COVID-19 and their potential effects on treatment response.","Delanghe, Joris R; De Buyzere, Marc L; Speeckaert, Marijn M",Adv Exp Med Biol,,475
403068,Drug discovery with explainable artificial intelligence,2020-07-01,"Purpose: We investigate the entrepreneurial intentions of a population under crisis — namely, recent Syrian refugees in Jordan — and Jordanian citizens to start small businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design/methodology/approach: Using a structured two-part survey, data were collected through online self-reported questionnaires in which respondents subjectively reported self-perceptions. The first part dealt with respondents’ characteristics and the second with their entrepreneurial intentions. The survey took place in Jordan, sampling Jordanian citizens and Syrian refugees. A nonprobability sampling technique was used to collect the data. Findings: The results show that net desirability for self-employment, tolerance for risk and self-efficacy are related to entrepreneurial intentions. We find significant differences between the Syrian refugees and the Jordanian citizens in terms of risk-taking and self-efficacy as determinants of engagement in entrepreneurial activities. Originality/value: This study offers guidance to institutions working with refugees during times of crisis. Implications are discussed. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Welsh, D. H.

404920,'The perfect storm': lax social distancing fuelled a coronavirus variant's Brazilian surge,2021,"SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic that has affected millions of people worldwide. Pharmaceutical research against COVID-19 and the most frequently used tests for SARS-CoV-2 both depend on the genomic and peptide sequences of the virus for their robustness. Therefore, understanding the mutation rates and content of the virus is critical. Two key proteins for SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication are the S protein, responsible for viral entry into the cells, and RdRp, the RNA polymerase responsible for replicating the viral genome. Due to their roles in the viral cycle, these proteins are crucial for the fitness and infectiousness of the virus. Our previous findings had shown that the two most frequently observed mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, 14408C>T in the RdRp coding region, and 23403A>G in the S gene, are correlated with higher mutation density over time. In this study, we further detail the selection dynamics and the mutation rates of SARS-CoV-2 genes, comparing them between isolates carrying both mutations, and isolates carrying neither. We find that the S gene and the RdRp coding region show the highest variance between the genotypes, and their selection dynamics contrast each other over time. The S gene displays higher tolerance for positive selection in mutant isolates early during the appearance of the double mutant genotype, and undergoes increasing negative selection over time, whereas the RdRp region in the mutant isolates shows strong negative selection throughout the pandemic.","Koçhan, Necla; Eskier, Doga; Suner, Asli; Karakülah, Gökhan; Oktay, Yavuz",Infect Genet Evol,,475
405182,RespiraConNosotros: A Viable Home-Based Telerehabilitation System for Respiratory Patients,2021,"Malaysia was faced with a life-threatening crisis in combating COVID-19 with a number of positive cases reaching 5305 and 88 deaths by 18th April 2020 (the first detected case was on 25th January 2020). The government rapidly initiated a public health response and provided adequate medical care to manage the public health crisis during the implementation of movement restrictions, starting 18th March 2020, throughout the country. The objective of this study was to investigate the relative efficiency level of managing COVID-19 in Malaysia using network data envelopment analysis. Malaysia state-level data were extracted from secondary data sources which include variables such as total number of confirmed cases, death cases and recovered cases. These variables were used as inputs and outputs in a network process that consists of 3 sub processes i) community surveillance, ii) medical care I and iii) medical care II. A state-level analysis was performed according to low, medium and high population density categories. The efficiency level of community surveillance was highest compared to medical care processes, indicating that the overall inefficiency is greatly influenced by the inefficiency of the medical care processes rather than the community surveillance process. Results showed that high-density category performed well in both community surveillance and medical care II processes. Meanwhile, low-density category performed better in medical care I process. There was a good overall performance of the health system in Malaysia reflecting a strong preparedness and response level to this pandemic. Furthermore, resource allocation for rapid response was distributed effectively during this challenging period.","Md Hamzah, Nurhafiza; Yu, Ming-Miin; See, Kok Fong",Health care manag. sci,,475
405496,News at a glance,2021,"BACKGROUND: Social distancing and shielding measures have been put in place to reduce social interaction and slow the transmission of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). For older people, self-isolation presents particular challenges for mental health and social relationships. As time progresses, continued social distancing could have a compounding impact on these concerns. OBJECTIVE: This project aims to provide a tool for older people and their families and peers to improve their well-being and health during and after regulated social distancing. First, we will evaluate the tool's feasibility, acceptability, and usability to encourage positive nutrition, enhance physical activity, and enable virtual interaction while social distancing. Second, we will be implementing the app to provide an online community to assist families and peer groups in maintaining contact with older people using goal setting. Anonymized data from the app will be aggregated with other real-world data sources to develop a machine learning algorithm to improve the identification of patients with COVID-19 and track for real time use by health systems. METHODS: Development of this project is occurring at the time of publication, and therefore, a case study design was selected to provide a systematic means of capturing software engineering in progress. The app development framework for software design was based on agile methods. The evaluation of the app's feasibility, acceptability and usability shall be conducted using Public Health England's guidance on evaluating digital health products, Bandura's model of health promotion, the Reach Effectiveness Adoption Implementation Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework and the Nonadoption, Abandonment and Challenges to the Scale-up, Spread and Suitability (NASSS) framework. RESULTS: Making use of a pre-existing software framework for health behavior change, a proof of concept was developed, and a multistage app development and deployment for the solution was created. Grant submissions to fund the project and study execution have been sought at the time of publication, and prediscovery iteration of the solution has begun. Ethical approval for a feasibility study design is being sought. CONCLUSIONS: This case study lays the foundations for future app development to combat mental and societal issues arising from social distancing measures. The app will be tested and evaluated in future studies to allow continuous improvement of the app. This novel contribution will provide an evidence-based exemplar for future app development in the space of social isolation and loneliness.","Meinert, Edward; Milne-Ives, Madison; Surodina, Svitlana; Lam, Ching",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,475

406350,Coronapod: How to define rare COVID vaccine side effects,2021,"The etiological agents involved in a bovine respiratory disease (BRD) outbreak were investigated in a dairy heifer calf rearing unit from southern Brazil. A battery of PCR assays was performed to detect the most common viruses and bacteria associated with BRD, such as bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), bovine alphaherpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1), bovine coronavirus (BCoV), bovine parainfluenza virus 3 (BPIV-3), Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, Histophilus somni, and Mycoplasma bovis. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples were taken from 21 heifer calves (symptomatic n = 15; asymptomatic n = 6) that, during the occurrence of the BDR outbreak, were aged between 6 and 90 days. At least one microorganism was detected in 85.7 % (18/21) of the BALF samples. Mixed infections were more frequent (72.2 %) than single infections (27.7 %). The interactions between viruses and bacteria were the most common in coinfections (55.5 %). The frequencies of BRD agents were 38.1 % for BRSV, 28.6 % for BVDV, 33.3 % for BCoV, 42.85 % for P. multocida, 33.3 % for M. bovis, and 19 % for H. somni. BoHV-1, BPIV-3, and M. haemolytica were not identified in any of the 21 BALF samples. Considering that BALF and not nasal swabs were analyzed, these results demonstrate the etiological multiplicity that may be involved in BRD outbreaks in dairy calves.","Oliveira, Victor H S; Dall Agnol, Alais M; Fritzen, Juliana T T; Lorenzetti, Elis; Alfieri, Amauri A; Alfieri, Alice F",Comp Immunol Microbiol Infect Dis,,475

Here, we describe the evolution of a total of five eligible patients diagnosed with COVID-19 who received convalescent plasma (CP) in Romania. Results: In spite of our efforts and convalescent plasma administration, three of the five patients did not survive, while the other two recovered completely. Over the course of our five-day laboratory record, the surviving patients had significantly lower values for C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, and white blood cells. Conclusions: This pilot study provides insufficient evidence to determine the efficacy of convalescent plasma use as a therapeutic option for critically ill COVID-19 patients.","Tirnea, Livius; Bratosin, Felix; Vidican, Iulia; Cerbu, Bianca; Turaiche, Mirela; Timircan, Madalina; Margan, Madalin-Marius; Marincu, Iosif",Medicina (Kaunas),,475

409345,Mentorship at a distance,2020,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, higher education institutions have been faced with a rapid shift to remote digital learning across courses. The resultant proliferation of online learning in traditional, hybrid, and distance higher education courses has enhanced the possibilities for technology-supported student-centered learning design. The prominence of feedback in student-centered teaching could be argued in two ways: (1) instructed learning is based on interaction and communication in which the teacher provides personalized information to students about their progress and (2) feedback is oriented towards students' improvements, which in turn guides student engagement. Therefore, feedback addressing students' personal needs integrates multiple dimensions and profoundly influences learning. In response to J. Borup, R. E. West, and R. Thomas (2015)'s article The Impact of Text Versus Video Communication on Instructor Feedback in Blended Courses we discusses the efforts to prepare higher education for online learning. During the pandemic, teachers rapidly faced requirements for providing feedback to students remotely and performing all teaching roles online. The authors in this section build a strong argument that feedback with a supportive function is essential in a time when students and teacher are working remotely. They argued for personalized learning requiring feedback at different points of the learning process that utilizes a range of feedback functions and forms and, most of all, employs contextualization and a situated approach.","Istenic, Andreja",Educ Technol Res Dev,,475

Children have become susceptible to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) because of their immature immune function. As the outbreak has progressed, more cases of novel coronavirus infection/pneumonia in children have been reported. Compared with adults, the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children is less severe, with a lower incidence and susceptibility in children, which results in fewer children being tested, thereby underestimating the actual number of infections. Therefore, strengthening the diagnosis of the disease is particularly important for children, and early and clear diagnosis can determine treatment strategies and reduce the harm caused by the disease to children. According to the Novel Coronavirus Infection Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Standards (trial version 7) issued by National Health Committee and the latest diagnosis and treatment strategies for novel coronavirus infection pneumonia in children, this review summarizes current strategies on diagnosis and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children.","Miao, Hongjun; Li, Han; Yao, Yinying; Wu, Mingfu; Lu, Chao; Wang, Jun; Tian, Man; Li, Ying; Luo, Peiliang; Gu, Jianhui; Yuan, Bin; Wang, Shouchuan; Zhao, Xia; Gan, Weihua; Zhao, Deyu",Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis,,475

411227,Real-time Mask Detection on Google Edge TPU,2020-10-09,"There are limited proven therapeutic options for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. The role of vitamin and mineral supplementation or ""immunonutrition"" has previously been explored in a number of clinical trials in intensive care settings, and there are several hypotheses to support their routine use. The aim of this narrative review was to investigate whether vitamin supplementation is beneficial in COVID-19. A systematic search strategy with a narrative literature summary was designed, using the Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane Trials Register, WHO International Clinical Trial Registry, and Nexis media databases. The immune-mediating, antioxidant and antimicrobial roles of vitamins A to E were explored and their potential role in the fight against COVID-19 was evaluated. The major topics extracted for narrative synthesis were physiological and immunological roles of each vitamin, their role in respiratory infections, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and COVID-19. Vitamins A to E highlighted potentially beneficial roles in the fight against COVID-19 via antioxidant effects, immunomodulation, enhancing natural barriers, and local paracrine signaling. Level 1 and 2 evidence supports the use of thiamine, vitamin C, and vitamin D in COVID-like respiratory diseases, ARDS, and sepsis. Although there are currently no published clinical trials due to the novelty of SARS-CoV-2 infection, there is pathophysiologic rationale for exploring the use of vitamins in this global pandemic, supported by early anecdotal reports from international groups. The final outcomes of ongoing trials of vitamin supplementation are awaited with interest.","Jovic, Thomas H; Ali, Stephen R; Ibrahim, Nader; Jessop, Zita M; Tarassoli, Sam P; Dobbs, Thomas D; Holford, Patrick; Thornton, Catherine A; Whitaker, Iain S",Nutrients,,475

The disease can be easily prevented through individual and societal combined efforts by keeping the environment safe, effective utilization of long lasting Insecticide Nets and early treatment. However, the factors for poor knowledge and practices of malaria prevention is not well studied in Ethiopia; particularly, in the study area. Hence, this study aimed to provide concrete evidence towards malaria prevention practices and associated factors among Households of Hawassa City Administration, Southern Ethiopia, 2020. METHOD: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among a randomly selected 598 households at Hawassa City Administration from April 1-15, 2020. Multistage sampling technique was employed to recruit the study households. Data were collected by trained data collectors through a face-to-face interview with pretested structured questionnaire, which was adapted from previous peer reviewed articles. Then the data were checked for the completeness and consistencies, then, coded and entered into Epi data 3.1 and it was exported to SPSS IBM version 23 for analysis. Descriptive mean with standard deviation was used to summarize the continuous variables. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression model was used to assess factors affecting prevention and control of Malaria. Finally, adjusted odds ratio together with 95% CI and p-value <0.05 was used to declare the statistical significances. RESULTS: The overall 317 (54.3%) of households practiced good measure of malaria prevention and control measures. Urban residence [AOR = 1.95 (95%CI: 1.17-3.24)], Secondary school completed [AOR = 5.02(95%CI 2.24-12.03)], Tertiary school completed [AOR = 7.27(95%CI: 2.84-18.55)], Positive Attitude [AOR = 8.20(95%CI: 5.31-12.68)] and Good knowledge about malaria [AOR = 2.81(95%CI: 1.78-4.44)] were significantly associated with malaria prevention practices. CONCLUSIONS: Nearly half of the households were still practiced poor measure of malaria prevention and control measures.

The purpose of our study was to predict the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on patient outcomes and use of hospital resources in Ontario, Canada. METHODS: We developed an individual-level simulation to model the flow of patients with COVID-19 through the hospital system in Ontario. We simulated different combined scenarios of epidemic trajectory and hospital health care capacity. Our outcomes included the number of patients who needed admission to the ward or to the intensive care unit (ICU) with or without the need for mechanical ventilation, number of days to resource depletion, number of patients awaiting resources and number of deaths. RESULTS: We found that with effective early public health measures, hospital system resources would not be depleted. For scenarios with late or ineffective implementation of physical distancing, hospital resources would be depleted within 14-26 days, and in the worst case scenario, 13 321 patients would die while waiting for needed resources. Resource depletion would be avoided or delayed with aggressive measures to increase ICU, ventilator and acute care hospital capacities. INTERPRETATION: We found that without aggressive physical distancing measures, the Ontario hospital system would have been inadequately equipped to manage the expected number of patients with COVID-19 despite a rapid increase in capacity. This lack of hospital resources would have led to an increase in mortality. By slowing the spread of the disease using public health measures and by increasing hospital capacity, Ontario may have avoided catastrophic stresses to its hospitals.","Barrett, Kali; Khan, Yasin A; Mac, Stephen; Ximenes, Raphael; Naimark, David M J; Sander, Beate",CMAJ,,475

These deny communities of the plausible supply of resources from FS. This paper assesses the perception underpinning the occurrence of nonfaecal matter in FS in Ghana. Primary data were obtained from 400 respondents in four communities in Brong Ahafo and Greater Accra Regions of Ghana, using a structured questionnaire. Data were analysed by using STATA software version 15. Chi-square test and multiple logistic regression were conducted on all independent variables and statistical significance was accepted at p < 0.05. The study identified the following as the most perceived frequently disposed nonfaecal matter into FS: sanitary pads and diapers (38.5%), fabrics/rags (23.2%), toilet rolls (20.8%), razor/shaving sticks (10.3%), and others (7.2%). Gender, state of toilet facility (roof or unroofed), presence of container for collecting other types of waste in the toilet room, and state of container in toilet room either covered or uncovered were the factors found to be significantly associated with the disposal of solid waste (SW) into FS at 95% confidence level. The fear of exposing used sanitary materials for rituals, the use of fabric as an alternative to toilet rolls, and the desire to conceal aborted pregnancies from the public were some of the reasons alluded to the disposal acts. Education and awareness campaigns on proper SW disposal practices, appropriate use of toilet facilities, and the resource potentials of FS were found to be the best way forward to discourage indiscriminate disposal of SW into FS.","Quarshie, Ama Mbeaba; Gyasi, Samuel Fosu; Kuranchie, Francis Atta; Awuah, Esi; Darteh, Eugene",J Environ Public Health,,475

421048,Wearable Transcutaneous CO2 Monitor Based on Miniaturized Nondispersive Infrared Sensor,2021,"In this paper, we investigate a free terminal time optimal control applied to 6 ordinary differential equations which describe the spread of COVID-19 infection. We propose an extension of the classical Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model, where the infectious patients are divided into unreported (U) and reported cases (I). To have a more realistic model, we estimate the parameters of our model using real Moroccan data. We use Bootstrap as a statistical method to improve the reliability of the parameters estimates. The main goal of this work is to find the optimal control strategy and to determine the optimal duration of a vaccination campaign adequate to eradicate the infection in Morocco. For this, we introduce into the model a saturated vaccination function, which takes into account the limited resources on the COVID-19 vaccine, and we formulate a minimization problem where the final time is considered to be free. The existence of optimal control is investigated. The characterization of the sought optimal control and optimal final time is derived based on Pontryagin's maximum principle. Using Matlab, we solve the optimality system with an iterative method based on the iterative Forward-Backward Sweep Method (FBSM). The numerical simulation results show the efficiency of a vaccination strategy on reducing the number of infectious individuals within an optimal period time which is approximately equal to 44 days.","Elhia, M.; Chokri, K.; Alkama, M.",Communications in Mathematical Biology and Neuroscience,,475

This fast motivated us to analyze publicly available 566 Indian complete or near complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes to find the mutation points as substitution, deletion and insertion. In this regard, we have performed the multiple sequence alignment in presence of reference sequence from NCBI. After the alignment, a consensus sequence is built to analyze each genome in order to identify the mutation points. As a consequence, we have found 933 substitutions, 2449 deletions and 2 insertions, in total 3384 unique mutation points, in 566 genomes across 29.9 K bp. Further, it has been classified into three groups as 100 clusters of mutations (mostly deletions), 1609 point mutations as substitution, deletion and insertion and 64 SNPs. These outcomes are visualized using BioCircos and bar plots as well as plotting entropy value of each genomic location. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis has also been performed to see the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 virus in India. It also shows the wide variation in tree which indeed vivid in genomic analysis. Finally, these SNPs can be the useful target for virus classification, designing and defining the effective dose of vaccine for the heterogeneous population.","Saha, Indrajit; Ghosh, Nimisha; Maity, Debasree; Sharma, Nikhil; Sarkar, Jnanendra Prasad; Mitra, Kaushik",Infect Genet Evol,,475

The purpose of this study was to evaluate transmission potential of COVID-19 by examining viral load with respect to time. METHODS: Health care personnel (HCP) at Cleveland Clinic diagnosed with COVID-19, who recovered without needing hospitalization, were identified. Threshold cycle (Ct) for positive PCR tests were obtained and viral loads calculated. Association of viral load with days since symptom onset was examined in a multivariable regression model, which was reduced by stepwise backward selection to only keep variables significant at a level of 0.05. Viral loads by day since symptom onset were predicted using the model and transmission potential evaluated by examination of a viral load-time curve. RESULTS: Over six weeks, 230 HCP had 528 tests performed. Viral loads declined by orders of magnitude within a few days of symptom onset. The only variable significantly associated with viral load was time since onset of symptoms. Of the area under the curve (AUC) spanning symptom onset to 30 days, 96.9% lay within the first 7 days, and 99.7% within 10 days. Findings were very similar when validated using split-sample and 10-fold cross-validation. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with non-severe COVID-19, viral loads in upper respiratory specimens peak by two or three days from symptom onset and decrease rapidly thereafter. The vast majority of the viral load-time AUC lies within 10 days of symptom onset.","Shrestha, Nabin K; Marco Canosa, Francisco; Nowacki, Amy S; Procop, Gary W; Vogel, Sherilynn; Fraser, Thomas G; Erzurum, Serpil C; Terpeluk, Paul; Gordon, Steven M",Clin. infect. dis,,475
424585,Integration of Virtual Programming into Beef Cattle Producer and Extension Agent Education,2021,"In the fight against the Coronavirus (COVID-19), health workers may experience mental health problems such as stress, anxiety, depressive symptoms, insomnia, denial, anger and fear. In a study in China, anxiety among health workers reached a 23.04%, with higher levels among women than men, and also higher among nurses than doctors. Likewise, in the general Chinese population, there was a moderate to severe psychological impact of 53.8%, with 16.5% of depressive symptoms, 28.8% of anxiety symptoms and 8.1% of stress, all of them between moderate to severe. Factors associated with a high psychological impact and high levels of stress, anxious and depressive symptoms were female sex, being a student, and having specific physical symptoms and a poor perception of their own health. Another study in China detected 35% of psychological distress in the general population, women presenting it more than men as well as the groups of 18-30 and over 60 years of age. The pandemic challenges us to take care of the health workers’ mental health as much as of the general population’s. Thus, the use of brief screening mental health scales, validated in our population, would be very effective to face the current public health challenges in our country.","Lozano-Vargas, Antonio",Rev.

424586,Integration of Virtual Programming into Beef Cattle Producer and Extension Agent Education,2021,"Mechanical ventilation is a known risk factor for delirium, a cognitive impairment characterized by frontal cortex and hippocampal dysfunction. Although interleukin-6 (IL-6) is upregulated in mechanical ventilation-induced lung injury (VILI) and may contribute to delirium, it is not known whether inhibition of systemic IL-6 mitigates delirium-relevant neuropathology. To histologically define neuropathological effects of IL-6 inhibition in an experimental VILI model. VILI was simulated in anesthetized adult mice using a 35cc/kg tidal volume mechanical ventilation model. There were two controls groups: 1) spontaneously breathing, or 2) anesthetized and mechanically ventilated with 10cc/kg tidal volume to distinguish effects of anesthesia from VILI. Two hours prior to inducing VILI, mice were treated with either anti-IL-6 antibody, anti-IL-6 receptor antibody, or saline. Neuronal injury, stress, and inflammation were assessed using immunohistochemistry. Cleaved caspase-3 (CC3), a neuronal apoptosis marker, was significantly increased in the frontal (p<0.001) and hippocampal (p<0.0001) brain regions and accompanied by significant increases in c-Fos and heat shock protein-90 in the frontal cortices of VILI mice compared to controls (p<0.001). These findings were not related to cerebral hypoxia and there was no evidence of irreversible neuronal death. Frontal and hippocampal neuronal CC3 were significantly reduced with anti-IL-6 antibody (p<0.01 and p<0.0001, respectively), anti-IL-6 receptor antibody (p<0.05 and p<0.0001, respectively) compared to saline VILI mice. VILI induces potentially reversible neuronal injury and inflammation in the frontal cortex and hippocampus, which is mitigated with IL-6 inhibition. These data suggest a potentially novel neuroprotective role of systemic IL-6 inhibition that justifies further investigation.","Sparrow, Nicklaus A; Anwar, Faizan; Covarrubias, Ambart E; Rajput, Padmesh S; Rashid, Mohammad Harun; Nisson, Peyton L; Gezalian, Michael M; Toossi, Shahed; Ayodele, Maranatha O; Karumanchi, S Ananth; Ely, E Wesley; Lahiri, Shouri",Am. j. respir. cell mol. biol,,475

426159,Biden's ambitious COVID plan: what scientists think,2021,"On December 12, 2019 a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, China, triggering a pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome in humans (COVID-19). Today, the scientific community is investing all the resources available to find any therapy and prevention strategies to defeat COVID-19. In this context, immunonutrition can play a pivotal role in improving immune responses against viral infections. Immunonutrition has been based on the concept that malnutrition impairs immune function. Therefore, immunonutrition involves feeding enriched with various pharmaconutrients (Omega 3 Fatty Acids, Vitamin C, Arginine, Glutamine, Selenium, Zinc, Vitamin, E and Vitamin D) to modulate inflammatory responses, acquired immune response and to improve patient outcomes. In literature, significant evidences indicate that obesity, a malnutrition state, negatively impacts on immune system functionality and on host defense, impairing protection from infections. Immunonutrients can promote patient recovery by inhibiting inflammatory responses and regulating immune function. Immune system dysfunction is considered to increase the risk of viral infections, such as SARS-CoV-2, and was observed in different pathological situations. Obese patients develop severe COVID-19 sequelae, due to the high concentrations of TNF-&#945;, MCP-1 and IL-6 produced in the meantime by visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue and by innate immunity. Moreover, leptin, released by adipose tissue, helps to increase inflammatory milieu with a dysregulation of the immune response. Additionally, gut microbiota plays a crucial role in the maturation, development and functions of both innate and adaptive immune system, as well as contributing to develop obese phenotype. The gut microbiota has been shown to affect lung health through a vital crosstalk between gut microbiota and lungs, called the ""gut-lung axis"". This axis communicates through a bi-directional pathway in which endotoxins, or microbial metabolites, may affect the lung through the blood and when inflammation occurs in the lung, this in turn can affect the gut microbiota. Therefore, the modulation of gut microbiota in obese COVID-19 patients can play a key role in immunonutrition therapeutic strategy. This umbrella review seeks to answer the question of whether a nutritional approach can be used to enhance the immune system's response to obesity in obese patients affected by COVID-19.","Di Renzo, Laura; Gualtieri, Paola; Pivari, Francesca; Soldati, Laura; Attinà, Alda; Leggeri, Claudia; Cinelli, Giulia; Tarsitano, Maria Grazia; Caparello, Giovanna; Carrano, Elena; Merra, Giuseppe; Pujia, Alberto Maria; Danieli, Roberta; De Lorenzo, Antonino",J Transl Med,,475

OBJECTIVE: In southern Germany, a telephone hotline for psychological first aid for COVID-19-related burdens was set up under the lead of the Baden-Wuerttemberg Ministry of Social Affairs and Integration, opened to the entire population and evaluated in April 2020. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In the period from 22 April to 24 July 2020, 753 volunteer psychotherapeutically trained counselors from different professional groups answered a total of 8096 calls. RESULTS: Depression symptoms (36%), anxiety symptoms (18%) and psychotic symptoms (19%) were most frequently reported. Every second call was related to a previous mental illness. During the counseling sessions, which lasted 25â¯min on average, a variety of psychological acute interventions were conducted. In the presence of unclear symptoms, psychotic symptoms or severe personality disorder symptoms, the counselors were able to help significantly less compared to the remaining calls in which other clearly defined symptoms were present. CONCLUSION: The results point to both the benefits and limitations of hotline services. The major benefits relate to the fast availability and effective professional help for people with clearly characterized symptoms. In the case of unclear or complex symptoms, immediate help by telephone seems to be possible only to a limited extent, but it could initiate access to further help offers. Overall, the results of this study provide a first indication that hotline services for psychological first aid are feasible under pandemic conditions.","Vonderlin, Ruben; Biermann, Miriam; Konrad, Michael; Klett, Martin; Kleindienst, Nikolaus; Bailer, Josef; Lis, Stefanie; Bohus, Martin",Nervenarzt,,475

Good mental health enables people to fulfill their roles in both family and society. When crises affect social life, people should be expected to experience high levels of stress. The COVID-19 pandemic, in addition to the physical health crisis, may also contribute to the exacerbation of stress and the emergence of mental illnesses. Many individuals suffer due to forced isolation or feel socially excluded. Also, many of them fear infection, death and losing family members. Moreover, specific population groups show varying degrees of COVID-19-related psychological stress. The paper presents the psychological problems of the consequences of COVID-19 in society based on a review of the latest articles available in the PubMed and Google Scholar databases. The discussed material points to different needs in terms of psychological support in the society. People in unstable living conditions are at a greater risk of losing their mental health. Moreover, their mental health needs may be completely overlooked. Emotional difficulties may worsen among children and adolescents as a result of both family stress and social isolation.

The present study describes a comprehensive survey of healthcare workers (HCWs) to describe their experiences using PPE in managing COVID-19 patients, with a particular focus on adverse skin reactions. A 24-hour prevalence study and multi-centre prospective survey were designed to capture the impact of PPE on skin health of hospital staff. Questionnaires incorporated demographics of participants, PPE type, usage time, and removal frequency. Participants reported the nature and location of any corresponding adverse skin reactions. The prevalence study included all staff in intensive care from a single centre, while the prospective study used a convenience sample of staff from three acute care providers in the United Kingdom. A total of 108 staff were recruited into the prevalence study, while 307 HCWs from a variety of professional backgrounds and demographics participated in the prospective study. Various skin adverse reactions were reported for the prevalence study, with the bridge of the nose (69%) and ears (30%) being the most affected. Of the six adverse skin reactions recorded for the prospective study, the most common were redness blanching (33%), itchiness (22%), and pressure damage (12%). These occurred predominantly at the bridge of the nose and the ears. There were significant associations (P < .05) between the adverse skin reactions with both the average daily time of PPE usage and the frequency of PPE relief. The comprehensive study revealed that the use of PPE leads to an array of skin reactions at various facial locations of HCWs. Improvements in guidelines are required for PPE usage to protect skin health. In addition, modifications to PPE designs are required to accommodate a range of face shapes and appropriate materials to improve device safety.","Abiakam, Nkemjika; Worsley, Peter; Jayabal, Hemalatha; Mitchell, Kay; Jones, Michaela; Fletcher, Jacqui; Spratt, Fran; Bader, Dan",Int. wound j,,475

Recently, several patients infected with novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were given HCQ, and showed a discrepant response. HCQ inhibits SARS-CoV-2 cell entry, and inflammatory cascade by interfering with lysosomal and endosomal activities, and autophagy, impeding virus-membrane fusion, and inhibiting cytokine production resulted from inflammatory pathways activation. Despite ongoing administration of HCQ in a wide spectrum of disorders, there are some reports about several side effects, especially retinopathy in some patients treated with HCQ. Cytochrome P450 (CYP450) and its isoforms are the main metabolizers of HCQ and CQ. Pharmacokinetic properties of CYP enzymes are influenced by CYP polymorphism, non-coding RNAs, and epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation, and histone acetylation. Accumulating evidence about side effects of HCQ in some patients raise the possibility that different response of patients to HCQ might be due to difference in their genome. Therefore, CYP450 genotyping especially for CYP2D6 might be helpful to refine HCQ dosage. Also, regular control of retina should be considered for patients under HCQ treatment. The major focus of the present review is to discuss about the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of CQ and HCQ that may be influenced by epigenetic mechanisms, and consequently cause several side effects especially retinopathy during SARS-CoV-2 therapy.","Paniri, Alireza; Hosseini, Mohammad Mahdi; Rasoulinejad, Ahmad; Akhavan-Niaki, Haleh",Eur J Pharmacol,,475

Such critical course of coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 is thought to associate with cytokine storm as in macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) or secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH), although these specific data are still lacking. In this study we aimed to directly address the question, whether immune activation in COVID-19 does indeed mimic conditions as in these classical cytokine storm syndromes. METHODS: We quantified levels of 22 biomarkers in serum samples of COVID-19 (n=30, n=83 longitudinal samples in total), sHLH/MAS patients (n=50) as well as healthy controls (n=9) using bead array assay as well as single-marker ELISA and correlated results with disease outcome. RESULTS: In sHLH/MAS we observed dramatic activation of the interleukin(IL)-18-interferon (IFN)-Î³ axis, while increased serum levels of IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and IL-8, as well as strongly reduced levels of soluble Fas ligand (sFasL) in course of SARS-CoV-2 infection discriminate immune dysregulation in critical COVID-19 from the investigated well-recognized cytokine storm conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Serum biomarker profiles clearly separate COVID-19 from MAS or sHLH, which questions the significance of systemic hyperinflammation following SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as the efficacy of drugs targeting key molecules and pathways specifically associated with systemic cytokine storm conditions in the treatment of COVID-19.","Kessel, Christoph; Vollenberg, Richard; Masjosthusmann, Katja; Hinze, Claas; Wittkowski, Helmut; Debaugnies, France; Nagant, Carole; Corazza, Francis; Vély, Frédéric; Kaplanski, Gilles; Girard-Guyonvarc039,; h, Charlotte; Gabay, Cem; Schmidt, Hartmut; Foell, Dirk; Tepasse, Phil-Robin",Arthritis rheumatol.

We argue that the public's perception of urban companion animals during emerging infectious disease outbreaks is related to medical and life science issues and reflects the political, economic, and emotional struggles involved in human-animal multispecies cohabitation. We find that the public has mainly followed and reconstructed medical discourses about the risk of companion animal-to-human transmission and discussed sustainable ethical animal practices in urban public health emergency management during the COVID-19 outbreak. Concerns regarding the risk of companion animal-related infection reflect the increasing prominence of more-than-human families, the pet industry, and multispecies leisure conflicts in public space in Chinese cities. The public's attention to animal ethics has prompted Chinese policy makers to adopt a more morally acceptable model for urban public health emergency management that can be sustained and supported by responsible non-governmental organizations and ethical urban residents.","Yin, Duo; Gao, Quan; Zhu, Hong; Li, Jie",Health Place,,475

This cross-sectional research study aimed to explore the social media use and characteristics of Generation Z in nursing students and to identify what were the most useful and preferred teaching methods during clinical training. Participants were Generation Z nursing degree students from a Spanish Higher Education Institution. A 41-item survey was developed and validated by an expert panel. The consecutive sample consisted of 120 students. Participants used social media for an average of 1.37 h (SD = 1.15) for clinical learning. They preferred, as teaching methods, linking mentorship learning to clinical experiences (x¯ = 3.51, SD = 0.88), online tutorials or videos (x¯ = 3.22, SD = 0.78), interactive gaming (x¯ = 3.09, SD = 1.14), and virtual learning environments (x¯ = 3, SD = 1.05). Regarding generational characteristics, the majority either strongly agreed or agreed with being high consumers of technology and cravers of the digital world (90.1%, n = 108 and 80%, n = 96). The authors consider it essential to expand our knowledge about the usefulness or possible use of teaching methods during clinical learning, which is essential at this moment because of the rapidly changing situation due to the Covid-19 pandemic.","Vizcaya-Moreno, M Flores; Pérez-Cañaveras, Rosa M",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,475

By analyzing the case of COVID-19, we illuminate patterns that may be helpful for understanding public perceptions of the response to a broader range of crises, including the impacts of hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, wildfires, and other hazards. We contribute to the public policy literature on public perceptions of government response to crises and expand it to include consideration of the role of nonstate actors. Drawing on a representative survey of 1200 registered voters in Texas, we find that individuals are more likely to view government as extremely important to respond to the pandemic than nonstate actors. We find that perceptions of the role of state and nonstate actors are shaped by risk perception, political ideology and religion, gender, and race/ethnicity. We do not find evidence that direct impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic consistently shape perceptions of the role of state and nonstate actors.","Sledge, Daniel; Thomas, Herschel F",,,475

458986,Deep Replication of a Runoff Portfolio,2020-09-10,"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to examine associations between smoking and COVID-19 relevant outcomes, taking into account the influence of inequalities and adjusting for potential confounding variables. METHODS: Cross-sectional data were used from an online study of adults in the UK (n=53 002). Main outcome measures were confirmed and suspected COVID-19, worry about catching or becoming seriously ill from COVID-19 and adherence to protective behaviours. Covariates included age, sex, ethnicity, education (post-16 qualifications: yes/no), key worker status and comorbid health conditions. RESULTS: Compared with never smokers (0.26% (95% CI 0.21% to 0.33%)), prevalence of confirmed COVID-19 was higher among current (0.56% (0.41% to 0.75%)) but not ex-smokers (0.19% (0.13% to 0.28%)). Associations were similar before (current: OR=2.14 (1.49-3.08); ex-smokers: OR=0.73 (0.47-1.14)) and after (current: OR=1.79 (1.22-2.62); ex-smokers: OR=0.85 (0.54-1.33)) adjustment. For current smokers, this was moderated by socio-economic position, with higher rates only seen in those without post-16 qualifications (OR=3.53 (2.04-6.10)). After including suspected cases, prevalence was higher among current smokers (11.2% (10.6% to 11.9%), OR=1.11 (1.03-1.20)) and ex-smokers (10.9% (10.4% to 11.5%), OR=1.07 (1.01-1.15)) than never smokers (10.2% (9.9% to 10.6%)), but remained higher only among ex-smokers after adjustment (OR=1.21 (1.13-1.29)). Current and ex-smokers had higher odds than never smokers of reporting significant stress about becoming seriously ill from COVID-19 (current: OR=1.34 (1.27-1.43); ex-smokers: OR=1.22 (1.16-1.28)). Adherence to recommendations to prevent spread of COVID-19 was high (96.3% (96.1% to 96.4%)), but lower among current than never smokers (OR=0.70 (0.62-0.78)). CONCLUSIONS: In a population sample, current smoking was independently associated with self-reported confirmed COVID-19 infection. There were socio-economic disparities, with the association only apparent among those without post-16 qualifications. Smokers reported lower adherence to guidelines despite being more worried than non-smokers about catching or becoming seriously ill from COVID-19.","Jackson, Sarah E; Brown, Jamie; Shahab, Lion; Steptoe, Andrew; Fancourt, Daisy",Tob. control,,475

Using a national survey of Generation Z conducted in late-May of 2020, our study measures attitudes toward the impact of the Coronavirus on personal health, financial and job concerns, views about shelter-in-place laws, and voting intentions in the 2020 presidential election. We find that Gen Z women express greater health and economic concerns and support for shelter-in-place measures than their male counterparts but this gender gap is largely mitigated by party identification and other covariates. Party also mediates the differences between young male and female voters in regard to the influence of the Coronavirus on their vote choice in 2020. Notably, however, women regardless of party affiliation hold significantly greater concern toward the impact of COVID-19 on their personal financial situation. Yet we find that Gen Z men express more concern about their personal health amid COVID-19 in more fully-specified statistical models. This research contributes to the growing literature that examines not only the sorting effect of party on the gender gap, but how different identitiesa-in this case generationa-can help explain the persistent political divides between men and women.","Deckman, Melissa; McDonald, Jared; Rouse, Stella; Kromer, Mileah",Polit.

This article aims to explore some of the challenges that the transplant teams may face with the new law, as well as raising awareness among the junior doctors, especially with the new COVID-19 transplant guidelines. Successful transplantations require immense training of healthcare professionals, fast retrieval services, pre- and postoperative care of patients, intensive care management, life-long follow-up and management of patients. Organ transplant surgery is a life-changing moment for a patient. Ultimately, commissioning groups, clinicians and managers need to work together, evaluate the changes required and enact thorough business plans to ensure the NHS is not overwhelmed. Together with increasing the awareness of organ donation within the public, the government needs to support the NHS to fund, train and manage transplant centres to welcome this much-awaited 'opt-out' organ donation law in England successfully.","Mahenthran, Thakshayene",Clin Med (Lond),,475

This article will review the reasons to consider valproic acid as a potential therapeutic to prevent severe COVID-19. Valproic acid could reduce angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and transmembrane serine protease 2 expression, required for SARS-CoV-2 viral entry, and modulate the immune cellular and cytokine response to infection, thereby reducing end-organ damage. The combined anti-thrombotic, anti-platelet, and anti-inflammatory effects of valproic acid suggest it could be a promising therapeutic target for COVID-19.","Pitt, Bertram; Sutton, Nadia R; Wang, Zhong; Goonewardena, Sascha N; Holinstat, Michael",Eur J Pharmacol,,475

However, the demand for transfusions in a general hospital designated to deal with COVID-19 patients has not been analysed before. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted to evaluate blood transfusion practices from 15 March to 14 April 2020 at Hospital Universitario Infanta Leonor (Madrid, Spain). During this month, with few exceptions, the hospital became a 'COVID-19' centre. In addition, transfusion rates during this time frame and the same period over the last 4 years were compared. RESULTS: From 15 March to 14 April 2020, only 254 blood components were transfused, resulting in a 49·3% reduction over the previous year. Interestingly, in critically ill patients, the red blood cell (RBC) transfusion/bed ratio significantly decreased during this period (0·92) compared to the same ratio over the past 4 years (2·70) (P = 0·02). Of note, 106 blood components (95 RBC; 11 platelet concentrates) were transfused to only 36 out of 1348 COVID-19 patients (2·7%). The main reason for RBC transfusion in COVID-19 patients was a previous underlying disease (44%) followed by bleeding (25%) and inflammatory anaemia (25%). CONCLUSION: This is the first study to report a decrease in blood transfusions during the COVID-19 pandemic in a general hospital and especially in the intensive care unit. The results of this study suggest that COVID-19 does not generally induce transfusion requiring anaemia, being the main causes for transfusion in these patients underlying conditions or bleeding.","Marín-Mori, Karen; González-Gascón Y Marín, Isabel; Foncillas-García, María-Ángeles; Muñoz-Novas, Carolina; Infante, María; Churruca-Sarasqueta, Juan; Landete-Hernández, Elena; Bueno-García, Begoña; Duffort-Falco, Mercedes; Hernández-Rivas, José-Ángel",Vox sang,,475

Additionally, all patients on admission to intensive care units had severe COVID-19 with 56% requiring mechanical ventilation with a pre-tocilizumab median (IQR) Pao2: Fio2 of 84 (69 - 108.6), 19% requiring vasopressor support, and inflammatory markers (CRP, LDH, ferritin, and IL-6) were elevated. The median (IQR) tocilizumab dose was 400 mg (400-600) which correlated with a weight-based mean (± SD) dose of 5.4 mg/kg ± 1.3. Of the 16 patients that received tocilizumab, 8 (50%) were discharged home, 7 (44%) died, and 1 (6%) was still hospitalized at the end of data collection. Patients who died were more likely to be older 62 ± 2 years, female (57%), had a higher rate of mechanical ventilation (86%) and vasopressors (43%) use at baseline, and had a higher median (IQR) IL-6 level prior to tocilizumab administration 550 pg/mL (IQR 83-1924). There were no reported adverse drug reactions reported after the administration of tocilizumab for any patient. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings do not support the effectiveness of tocilizumab in treatment of severe COVID-19 infection in critically ill patients.","McKenzie, Matt G; Lee, Yeunju Michelle; Mathew, Julin; Anderson, Megan; Vo, Alison T; Akinyele, Samuel; Narayanan, Malarvizhi",J Pharm Pract,,475

476648,The long shot,2020,"OBJECTIVES: We evaluated whether implementation of lockdown orders in South Africa affected ambulatory clinic visitation in rural Kwa-Zulu Natal (KZN). DESIGN: Observational cohort SETTING: Data were analysed from 11 primary healthcare clinics in northern KZN. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 46 523 individuals made 89 476 clinic visits during the observation period. EXPOSURE OF INTEREST: We conducted an interrupted time series analysis to estimate changes in clinic visitation with a focus on transitions from the prelockdown to the level 5, 4 and 3 lockdown periods. OUTCOME MEASURES: Daily clinic visitation at ambulatory clinics. In stratified analyses, we assessed visitation for the following subcategories: child health, perinatal care and family planning, HIV services, non-communicable diseases and by age and sex strata. RESULTS: We found no change in total clinic visits/clinic/day at the time of implementation of the level 5 lockdown (change from 90.3 to 84.6 mean visits/clinic/day, 95% CI -16.5 to 3.1), or at the transitions to less stringent level 4 and 3 lockdown levels. We did detect a >50% reduction in child healthcare visits at the start of the level 5 lockdown from 11.9 to 4.7 visits/day (-7.1 visits/clinic/day, 95% CI -8.9 to 5.3), both for children aged <1 year and 1-5 years, with a gradual return to prelockdown within 3 months after the first lockdown measure. In contrast, we found no drop in clinic visitation in adults at the start of the level 5 lockdown, or related to HIV care (from 37.5 to 45.6, 8.0 visits/clinic/day, 95% CI 2.1 to 13.8). CONCLUSIONS: In rural KZN, we identified a significant, although temporary, reduction in child healthcare visitation but general resilience of adult ambulatory care provision during the first 4 months of the lockdown. Future work should explore the impacts of the circulating epidemic on primary care provision and long-term impacts of reduced child visitation on outcomes in the region.","Siedner, Mark J; Kraemer, John D; Meyer, Mark J; Harling, Guy; Mngomezulu, Thobeka; Gabela, Patrick; Dlamini, Siphephelo; Gareta, Dickman; Majozi, Nomathamsanqa; Ngwenya, Nothando; Seeley, Janet; Wong, Emily; Iwuji, Collins; Shahmanesh, Maryam; Hanekom, Willem; Herbst, Kobus",BMJ Open,,475

Case Presentation: A 30-year-old previously healthy female was admitted with generalized tonic-clonic seizure in the neurology emergency room. The patient complained of dry cough five days before the admission. She had seizures (five times) approximately every 8 hours. Brain MRI was normal and chest CT revealed focal ground-glass opacities. The respiratory specimen was positive for COVID-19 using real-time PCR assay. The symptoms of the patient improved with anticonvulsive and antiviral medications. Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case study to report an association between frequent seizures and COVID- 19. In our opinion, there is a hypothesis about this subject that the etiology of seizure may be due to encephalitis and invasion virus to the brain or toxic effect of inflammatory cytokines.","Karimi, Narges; Razavi, Athena Sharifi; Rouhani, Nima",Iran.

484733,In Case You Missed It: Business News from the Field,2020,"The COVID-19 outbreak exposed several problems faced by health systems worldwide, especially concerning the safe and rapid generation and sharing of health data. However, this pandemic scenario has also facilitated the rapid implementation and monitoring of technologies in the health field. In view of the occurrence of the public emergency caused by SARS-CoV-2 in Brazil, the Department of Informatics of the Brazilian Unified Health System created a contingency plan. In this paper, we aim to report the digital health strategies applied in Brazil and the first results obtained during the fight against COVID-19. Conecte SUS, a platform created to store all the health data of an individual throughout their life, is the center point of the Brazilian digital strategy. Access to the platform can be obtained through an app by the patient and the health professionals involved in the case. Health data sharing became possible due to the creation of the National Health Data Network (Rede Nacional de Dados em Saúde, RNDS). A mobile app was developed to guide citizens regarding the need to go to a health facility and to assist in disseminating official news about the virus. The mobile app can also alert the user if they have had contact with an infected person. The official numbers of cases and available hospital beds are updated and published daily on a website containing interactive graphs. These data are obtained due to creating a web-based notification system that uses the RNDS to share information about the cases. Preclinical care through telemedicine has become essential to prevent overload in health facilities. The exchange of experiences between medical teams from large centers and small hospitals was made possible using telehealth. Brazil took a giant step toward digital health adoption, creating and implementing important initiatives; however, these initiatives do not yet cover the entire health system. It is expected that the sharing of health data that are maintained and authorized by the patient will become a reality in the near future. The intention is to obtain better clinical outcomes, cost reduction, and faster and better services in the public health network.","Donida, Bruna; da Costa, Cristiano André; Scherer, Juliana Nichterwitz",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,475

METHODS: From January 2008 to December 2013 patients treated with posterior ICBG and a minimum follow-up of 5 years were included. Clinical outcome of patients operated with a posterior ICBG was analyzed with multiple patient-reported outcome measures included Constant (CS), American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES), Walch-Duplay, and Rowe score, shoulder subjective value (SSV) and pain visual analog score (VAS). Patient satisfaction was assessed by asking the patients their overall level of satisfaction at last follow-up on a 1 to 10 scale. RESULTS: 18 patients (19 shoulders) were included. At a mean follow-up of 7.3 years (range, 5 to 10), patients had significant improvements in their mean CS from 63 (SD 18) to 80 (SD 18; p = 0.005), ASES from 57 (SD 18) to 81 (SD 18; p = 0.003), Walch-Duplay from 34 (SD 31) to 79 (SD 22; p < 0.001) and Rowe score from 37 (SD 23) to 79 (SD 24; p < 0.001). Pain level decreased from 5.6 (SD 2.5) preoperative to 2.3 (SD 2.3; p < 0.001) and SSV improved 58 (SD 20) to 76 (SD 24; p = 0.002). Global satisfaction with the procedure was 8.4 (SD 2.1). Clinical significance was met or exceeded by 84% for CS and 89% of the patients for ASES and 95% met or exceeded satisfaction threshold for CS. There were 7 shoulders (37%) re-operated for symptomatic screw irritation. CONCLUSION: This series reporting on the long-term follow-up after arthroscopic posterior ICBG for recurrent posterior shoulder instability demonstrates despite a high number of reoperation for symptomatic screw irritation its effectiveness with acceptable clinical outcomes and satisfied patients.

494344,Biased Neural Representation of Feature-Based Attention in the Human Frontoparietal Network,2020,"BACKGROUND: Low airway surface pH is associated with many airway diseases, impairs antimicrobial host defense and worsens airway inflammation. Inhaled Optate is designed to safely to raise airway surface pH and is well-tolerated in humans. Raising intracellular pH partially prevents activation of SARS-CoV-2 in primary normal human airway epithelial (NHAE) cells, decreasing viral replication by several mechanisms. METHODS: Here, we grew primary normal human airway epithelial (NHAE) cells from healthy subjects, infected them with SARS-CoV-2 (isolate USA-WA1/2020), and used clinical Optate at concentrations used in humans in vivo to determine whether it would prevent viral infection and replication. Cells were pre-treated with Optate or placebo prior to infection (MOI of 0.1) and viral replication was determined by plaque assay and nucleocapsid (N) protein levels. Healthy human subjects also inhaled Optate as part of a Phase 2a safety trial. RESULTS: Optate almost completely prevented viral replication at each time point between 24 and 120 hours, relative to placebo, both by plaque assay and by N protein expression (p < 0.001). Mechanistically, Optate inhibited expression of major endosomal trafficking genes and raised NHAE intracellular pH. Optate had no effect on NHAE cell viability at any time point. Inhaled Optate was well tolerated in 10 normal subjects, with no change in lung function, vital signs or oxygenation. CONCLUSIONS: Inhaled Optate may be well-suited for a clinical trial in patients with a pulmonary SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, it is vitally important for patient safety that formulations designed for inhalation with regards to pH, isotonicity and osmolality be used. An inhalational treatment that safely prevents SARS-CoV-2 viral replication could be helpful for treating patients with pulmonary SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Davis, Michael D; Clemente, Tatiana M; Giddings, Olivia K; Ross, Kristie; Cunningham, Rebekah S; Smith, Laura; Simpson, Edward; Liu, Yunlong; Kloepfer, Kirsten; Ramsey, I Scott; Zhao, Yi; Robinson, Christopher M; Gilk, Stacey D; Gaston, Benjamin",Respir. care,,475

Is privacy the price?,2020,"As the world went suddenly into lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, sending individuals to their homes and shutting businesses and institutions, the closing of schools posed big problems. The majority of the world's children were out of school, leading to the longest sustained period of school closures in history. We saw educators turning towards responses not aimed at collegial and community-engaged strategies for education in an emergency but at online learning cast as education/business as usual. This study explores the logic driving this global response through analyses of the documents released by three key global education actors: (1) the OECD and its paper A Framework to Guide Education Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic of 2020; (2) UNESCO's Global Education Coalition #LearningNeverStops; and (3) the World Bank's Guidance Note on Education Systems' Response to COVID-19; and Guidance Note: Remote Learning and COVID-19. The authors of this article draw on Carol Bacchi's approach to poststructural policy analysis to make visible the key concepts and binaries used within policy texts and to understand the ""technologies of saving"" that were invoked in each policy response, locating the education programmes, activities and actors within knowledge practices in educational reform. This article explores the World Bank, OECD and UNESCO responses using an analysis of knowledge harmonisation and difference among these institutions as well as their location as key norm-setters and governing actors in the field of education. The authors argue that all three responses privilege private-sector providers of digital technology. The consequence of these responses is that technologies of saving have centred on privatised, corporate edu-business and edu-tech aimed at online education delivery, bringing significant risks for the erasure of local knowledges. The authors' study suggests that local policymakers, including community-based and national actors, must be invited into the discussion to envision other possibilities and to name the potential destructiveness embedded in the international organisations' actions.","Shultz, Lynette; Viczko, Melody",Int Rev Educ,,475
498187,Introduction of new commissioning editor,2020,"The current coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is again reminding us of the importance of using telehealth to deliver care, especially as means of reducing the risk of cross-contamination caused by close contact. For telehealth to be effective as part of an emergency response it first needs to become a routinely used part of our health system. Hence, it is time to step back and ask why telehealth is not mainstreamed. In this article, we highlight key requirements for this to occur. Strategies to ensure that telehealth is used regularly in acute, post-acute and emergency situations, alongside conventional service delivery methods, include flexible funding arrangements, training and accrediting our health workforce. Telehealth uptake also requires a significant change in management effort and the redesign of existing models of care. Implementing telehealth proactively rather than reactively is more likely to generate greater benefits in the long-term, and help with the everyday (and emergency) challenges in healthcare.","Smith, Anthony C; Thomas, Emma; Snoswell, Centaine L; Haydon, Helen; Mehrotra, Ateev; Clemensen, Jane; Caffery, Liam J",J Telemed Telecare,,475
499883,Viral evolution may herald new pandemic phase,2021,"Recently, ISCHEMIA trial was published in order to determine the effect of adding cardiac catheterization and revascularization when feasible to medical therapy in patients with stable CAD and moderate or severe ischemia. Over a median of 3.2 years of follow-up, among patients with stable CAD who had moderate or severe ischemia on stress testing, an initial invasive strategy, as compared with an initial conservative strategy, did not reduce the rates of the primary or key secondary composite outcomes. The primary outcome was the composite of death from cardiovascular causes, myocardial infarction (MI), or hospitalization for unstable angina, heart failure, or resuscitated cardiac arrest. The key secondary outcomes were the composite of death from cardiovascular causes or MI and angina-related quality of life. Patients in the invasive-strategy group had more procedural myocardial MIs, and they had fewer spontaneous infarctions during follow-up. The incidence of death from any cause was low and similar in the two groups. However, the ISCHEMIA trial was challenging to implement, event rates were low and enrollment fell behind initial milestones. Furthermore, power of the study was compromised, composite end-point definition as well as definitions of crucial individual components were changed amid study progression. There was a ""heterobaric"" combined end-point with procedural MIs favoring the conservative arm and spontaneous MIs favoring the invasive arm. Finally, the duration of reported follow-up showed signals that findings may shift in favor of invasive treatment and results were sensitive to definition and type of MIs. Therefore, we believe that it is premature to change clinical practice in view of the results of ISCHEMIA trial. As stable CAD patients is a vastly heterogenous patient group, it may be prudent to apply common clinical judgement and individual decision-making according to current guidelines before changing our management strategies.","Tziakas, Dimitrios; Chalikias, George; Triantis, George; Dagre, Anna",Hell. j. cardiol,,475
499936,Application of Artificial Neural Network for Internal Combustion Engines: A State of the Art Review,2021,"Covid-19 infection is a multisystem disease more frequent in older individuals, especially in those with multiple chronic diseases. This multimorbid and frail population requires attention and a personalized comprehensive assessment in order to avoid the occurrence of adverse outcomes. As other diseases, the COVID-19 presentation in older patients is often atypical with less severe and unspecific symptoms. These subjects both at home and during hospitalization suffer isolation and the lack of support of caregivers. The geriatric care in COVID-19 wards is often missing. The application of additional instruments would be necessary to facilitate and personalize the clinical approach, not only based on diseases but also on functional status. This narrative review starts from diagnostic evaluation, continues with adapted pharmacologic treatment and ends with the recovery phase targeting the nutrition and physical exercise. We developed a check-list of respiratory, gastro-intestinal and other less-specific symptoms, summarized in a table and easily to be filled-up by patients, nurses and general practitioners. As second step, we reported the clinical phases of this disease. Far to be considered just viral infective and respiratory, this disease is also an inflammatory and thrombotic condition with frequent bacterial over-infection. We finally considered timing and selection of treatment, which depend on the disease phase, co-administration of other drugs and require the monitoring of renal, liver and cardiac function. This underlines the role of age not just as a limitation, but also an opportunity to increase the quality and the appropriateness of multidisciplinary and multidimensional intervention in this population.","Lauretani, Fulvio; Ravazzoni, Giulia; Roberti, Maria Federica; Longobucco, Yari; Adorni, Elisa; Grossi, Margherita; De Iorio, Aurelio; La Porta, Umberto; Fazio, Chiara; Gallini, Elena; Federici, Raffaele; Salvi, Marco; Ciarrocchi, Erika; Rossi, Francesca; Bergamin, Marina; Bussolati, Giacomo; Grieco, Ilaria; Broccoli, Federica; Zucchini, Irene; Ielo, Giuseppe; Morganti, Simonetta; Artoni, Andrea; Arisi, Arianna; Tagliaferri, Sara; Maggio, Marcello",Acta Biomed,,475

Governments around the globe have adopted and implemented a series of social distancing strategies. The efficacy of various policies and their comparative influence on mechanisms led by public actions and adoptions have not been examined. The differences in types and effective dates of various social distancing policies in various provinces/territories of Pakistan constitute a pure ground to examine the causal effects of each COVID-19 policy. Using the location trends and population movement data released by Google, a quasi-experimental method was used to measure the impact of the government's various social distancing policies on the people's existence at home and their outside social mobility. Based on the magnitude and importance of policy influences, this research ranked six social distancing policies whose influence exceeded the effect of voluntary behavior. Our research outcomes describe that the trend of staying at home was firmly pushed by state-wide home order rather than necessary business closings and policies that were associated with public gathering restrictions. Strong government policies have a strong causal effect on reducing social interactions.","Shahzad, Fakhar; Du, Jianguo; Khan, Imran; Ahmad, Zeeshan; Shahbaz, Muhammad",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,475

504819,Sharing COVID data? Check these recommendations and guidelines,2021,"Purpose This study aims to explore changes in working capital management (WCM) practices in response to economic downturns, especially during the coronavirus pandemic. Design/methodology/approach This study adopts an interpretative approach. This paper used semi-structured interviews with 2 finance directors and 13 top managers for data collection. This paper used thematic analysis for analysing the interview data. Findings The study findings suggest that the traditional ways of managing working capital may no longer be sufficient during a crisis. Instead, dynamic financing, trade credit policy and continuous staff training to develop new skills are alternative WCM practices to navigate the challenges of a crisis. Further, this paper finds that economic conditions, such as inflation rates, interest rates, exchange rates and government policy, negatively affect WCM. Practical implications The study findings highlight practical issues that may help firms meet their present and future financing needs, manage their day-to-day operational activities and enhance performance, both operational and financial. The study is beneficial for regulators in understanding a firm's constraints during crises and respond appropriately. Originality/value This is the first study, to the best of the knowledge that uses a qualitative approach to investigate the impact of economic downturns on WCM practices of firms. Thus, this study offers new insights into the fundamentals of WCM practices during crises.","Simon, S.; Sawandi, N.; Kumar, S.; El-Bannany, M.",Qualitative Research in Financial Markets,,475
505246,The influence of immune individuals in disease spread evaluated by cellular automaton and genetic algorithm,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Keeping Canadians safe requires a robust public health (PH) system. This is especially true when there is a PH emergency, like the COVID-19 pandemic. Social media, like Twitter and Facebook, is an important information channel because most people use the internet for their health information. The PH sector can use social media during emergency events for (1) PH messaging, (2) monitoring misinformation, and (3) responding to questions and concerns raised by the public. In this study, we ask: what is the Canadian PH risk communication response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the context of social media? METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will conduct a case study using content and sentiment analysis to examine how provinces and provincial PH leaders, and the Public Health Agency of Canada and national public heath leaders, engage with the public using social media during the first wave of the pandemic (1 January-3 September 2020). We will focus specifically on Twitter and Facebook. We will compare findings to a gold standard during the emergency with respect to message content. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Western University's research ethics boards confirmed that this study does not require research ethics board review as we are using social media data in the public domain. Using our study findings, we will work with PH stakeholders to collaboratively develop Canadian social media emergency response guideline recommendations for PH and other health system organisations. Findings will also be disseminated through peer-reviewed journal articles and conference presentations.","Kothari, Anita; Foisey, Lyndsay; Donelle, Lorie; Bauer, Michael",BMJ Open,,475

509314,These methods from psychiatry can help you beat stress during the coronavirus pandemic,2020,"Background: Montefiore Medical Center (MMC) is a large tertiary care center in the Bronx, New York City, with 245 internal medicine residents. Beginning on February 29, 2020, residents became ill with COVID-19-like illness (CLI), which required absence from work. There was initially a shortage of personal protective equipment and delays in SARS-CoV-2 testing, which gradually improved during March and April 2020. Objective: We evaluated the relationship between CLI-related work absence rates of internal medicine residents and MMC's COVID-19 hospital census over time. Methods: Data on resident work absence between February 29 and May 22 were reviewed along with MMC's COVID-19 hospital census data. To determine the effect of patient exposure on resident CLI incidence, we compared the mean incidence of CLI per patient exposure days (PED = daily hospital census × days pre- or post-peak) before and after peak COVID-19 hospital census. Results: Forty-two percent (103 of 245) of internal medicine residents were absent from work, resulting in 875 missed workdays. At the peak of resident work absence, 16% (38 of 245) were out sick. Residents were absent for a median of 7 days (IQR 6-9.5 days). Mean resident CLI incidence per PED (CLI/PED) was 13.9-fold lower post-peak compared to pre-peak (P = .003). Conclusions: At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City, a large portion of internal medicine residents at this single center became ill. However, the incidence of CLI decreased over time, despite ongoing exposure to patients with COVID-19.","Merkin, Ross; Kruger, Ariel; Bhardwaj, Gaurav; Kajita, Grace R; Shapiro, Lauren; Galen, Benjamin T",J Grad Med Educ,,475

514937,Coronavirus and public holidays: what the data say,2020,"Twenty-five years have passed since the first clinical trial utilising mesenchymal stomal/stem cells (MSCs) in 1995. In this time academic research has grown our understanding of MSC biochemistry and our ability to manipulate these cells in vitro using chemical, biomaterial, and mechanical methods. Research has been emboldened by the promise that MSCs can treat illness and repair damaged tissues through their capacity for immunomodulation and differentiation. Since 1995, 31 therapeutic products containing MSCs and/or progenitors have reached the market with the level of in vitro manipulation varying significantly. In this review, we summarise existing therapeutic products containing MSCs or mesenchymal progenitor cells and examine the challenges faced when developing new therapeutic products. Successful progression to clinical trial, and ultimately market, requires a thorough understanding of these hurdles at the earliest stages of in vitro pre-clinical development. It is beneficial to understand the health economic benefit for a new product and the reimbursement potential within various healthcare systems. Pre-clinical studies should be selected to demonstrate efficacy and safety for the specific clinical indication in humans, to avoid duplication of effort and minimise animal usage. Early consideration should also be given to manufacturing: how cell manipulation methods will integrate into highly controlled workflows and how they will be scaled up to produce clinically relevant quantities of cells. Finally, we summarise the main regulatory pathways for these clinical products, which can help shape early therapeutic design and testing.","Childs, Peter G; Reid, Stuart; Salmeron-Sanchez, Manuel; Dalby, Matthew J",Biochem J,,475

On the other hand, the presence of hazardous infectious waste led to the increase of the risk of transmitting the virus by individuals and by hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic. Hence, in this review, we survey previous researches on nanomaterials that can be effective for guiding strategies to deal with the current COVID-19 pandemic and also decrease the hazardous infectious waste in the environment. We highlight the contribution of nanomaterials that possess potential to therapy, prevention, detect targeted virus proteins and also can be useful for large population screening, for the development of environmental sensors and filters. Besides, we investigate the possibilities of employing the nanomaterials in antiviral research and treatment development, examining the role of nanomaterials in antiviral- drug design, including the importance of nanomaterials in drug delivery and vaccination, and for the production of medical equipment. Nanomaterials-based technologies not only contribute to the ongoing SARS- CoV-2 research efforts but can also provide platforms and tools for the understanding, protection, detection and treatment of future viral diseases.","Ghaemi, Ferial; Amiri, Amirhassan; Bajuri, Mohd Yazid; Yuhana, Nor Yuliana; Ferrara, Massimiliano",Sustain Cities Soc,,475

Molnupiravir is a broad-spectrum antiviral that is an orally bioavailable prodrug of the nucleoside analogue ß-D-N4-hydroxycytidine (NHC). Molnupiravir or NHC can increase G to A and C to U transition mutations in replicating coronaviruses. These increases in mutation frequencies can be linked to increases in antiviral effects; however, biochemical data of molnupiravir-induced mutagenesis have not been reported. Here we studied the effects of the active compound NHC 5'-triphosphate (NHC-TP) against the purified severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase complex. The efficiency of incorporation of natural nucleotides over the efficiency of incorporation of NHC-TP into model RNA substrates followed the order GTP (12,841) > ATP (424) > UTP (171) > CTP (30), indicating that NHC-TP competes predominantly with CTP for incorporation. No significant inhibition of RNA synthesis was noted as a result of the incorporated monophosphate in the RNA primer strand. When embedded in the template strand, NHC-monophosphate supported the formation of both NHC:G and NHC:A base pairs with similar efficiencies. The extension of the NHC:G product was modestly inhibited, but higher nucleotide concentrations could overcome this blockage. In contrast, the NHC:A base pair led to the observed G to A (G:NHC:A) or C to U (C:G:NHC:A:U) mutations. Together, these biochemical data support a mechanism of action of molnupiravir that is primarily based on RNA mutagenesis mediated via the template strand.","Gordon, Calvin J; Tchesnokov, Egor P; Schinazi, Raymond F; Götte, Matthias",J Biol Chem,,475

In this study we aimed to construct machine-learning (ML) models to predict severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection based on the clinical features of patients visiting an ED during the early COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We retrospectively collected the data of all patients who received reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing for SARS-CoV-2 at the ED of Baylor Scott & White All Saints Medical Center, Fort Worth, from February 23-May 12, 2020. The variables collected included patient demographics, ED triage data, clinical symptoms, and past medical history. The primary outcome was the confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 (or SARS-CoV-2 infection) by a positive RT-PCR test result for SARS-CoV-2, and was used as the label for ML tasks. We used univariate analyses for feature selection, and variables with P<0.1 were selected for model construction. Samples were split into training and testing cohorts on a 60:40 ratio chronologically. We tried various ML algorithms to construct the best predictive model, and we evaluated performances with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) in the testing cohort. RESULTS: A total of 580 ED patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2 during the study periods, and 98 (16.9%) were identified as having the SARS-CoV-2 infection based on the RT-PCR results. Univariate analyses selected 21 features for model construction. We assessed three ML methods for performance: of the three methods, random forest outperformed the others with the best AUC result (0.86), followed by gradient boosting (0.83) and extra trees classifier (0.82). CONCLUSION: This study shows that it is feasible to use ML models as an initial screening tool for identifying patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further validation will be necessary to determine how effectively this prediction model can be used prospectively in clinical practice.","Chou, Eric H; Wang, Chih-Hung; Hsieh, Yu-Lin; Namazi, Babak; Wolfshohl, Jon; Bhakta, Toral; Tsai, Chu-Lin; Lien, Wan-Ching; Sankaranarayanan, Ganesh; Lee, Chien-Chang; Lu, Tsung-Chien",West J Emerg Med,,475

It alleviates childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus cSLE skin and musculoskeletal disease, decreasing disease activity and flares. HCQ concentration–effect relationships in children remains unknown. This study aimed to investigate the pharmacokinetics of HCQ and possible concentration–effect relationships. Methods: HCQ blood concentrations and effects were obtained during clinical follow-up on different occasions. cSLE flares were defined using the SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI); flare was denoted by a SLEDAI score > 6. Blood concentration was measured using high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorometric detection. Statistical analysis was performed using a nonlinear mixed-effect approach with the Monolix software. Results: A total of 168 blood samples were obtained from 55 pediatric patients. HCQ apparent blood clearance (CL/F) was dependent on patients’ bodyweight and platelet count. Patients with active cSLE had a lower mean blood HCQ concentration compared with inactive cSLE patients (536 ± 294 vs. 758 ± 490 ng/mL, p = 5 × 10(−6)). Among patients with HCQ blood concentration ≥750 ng/mL, 87.6% had inactive cSLE. Moreover, HCQ blood concentration was a significant predictor of disease status. Conclusion: We developed the first HCQ blood concentration–effect relationship for cSLE associated with active or non-active disease status. A prospective randomized study is necessary to confirm these results.","Zahr, Noël; Urien, Saik; Funck-Brentano, Christian; Vantomme, Hélène; Garcelon, Nicolas; Melki, Isabelle; Boistault, Margaux; Boyer, Olivia; Bader-Meunier, Brigitte",Pharmaceuticals (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33802811/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ph14030273,475

However, there has been not analyzed its capability to predict primary bloodstream infection (PBSI), that include CRBSI and bloodstream infection of unknown origin (BSIUO). The novel objective of our study was to determine the capability of insertion skin site culture to predict CRBSI and primary bloodstream infection (PBSI), that include CRBSI and bloodstream infection of unknown origin (BSIUO). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Observational and prospective study in one Intensive Care Unit. Patients with some central venous catheter (CVC) at least during 7 days and suspected catheter-related infection (CRI) (new episode of fever or sepsis) were included. Cultures of insertion skin site, paired blood samples, catheter-tip, and other clinical samples were taken. Capability of insertion skin site culture to predict CRBSI and PBSI was determined. RESULTS: We included 108 CVC from 96 CRI suspicion episodes. The causes that motivated CRI suspicion were 20 (18.5%) PBSI, 44 (40.7%) other infections, and 44 (40.7%) unknown. Among the 20 PBSI, 11 (55%) were CRBSI and 9 (45%) were BSIUO. Negative predictive value of insertion skin site culture to predict CRBSI was 95% (87–98%) and to predict PBSI was 85% (76–91%). CONCLUSIONS: The new finding of our study was that skin insertion site culture had a good negative predicted valued for the prediction of CRBSI and PBSI.","Lorente, Leonardo; Lecuona, María; Pérez-Llombet, Alejandra; González-Mesa, Adriana; Callejon, Manuel; Jiménez, Alejandro; Mora, María Luisa; Madueño, Ana",Ir J Med Sci,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11845-021-02685-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34121133/,475

Telehealth systems that include health coaching and remote monitoring are making inroads in managing chronic conditions and may be especially suited for older populations. OBJECTIVE: This literature review aimed to investigate the current status of health coaching interventions incorporating telehealth technology and the associated effectiveness of this intervention to deliver health care with an emphasis on older adults (aged 65 and older). METHODS: A literature review was conducted to identify the research conducted on health coaching combined with remote monitoring for delivering health care to older adults. The Ovid MEDLINE and CINAHL databases were queried using a combination of relevant search terms (including middle aged, aged, older adult, elderly, health coaching, and wellness coaching). The search retrieved 196 papers published from January 2010 to September 2019 in English. Following a systematic review process, the titles and abstracts of the papers retrieved were screened for applicability to health coaching for older adults to define a subset for further review. Papers were excluded if the studied population did not include older adults. The full text of the 42 papers in this subset was then reviewed, and 13 papers related to health coaching combined with remote monitoring for older adults were included in this review. RESULTS: Of the 13 studies reviewed, 10 found coaching supported by telehealth technology to provide effective outcomes. Effectiveness outcomes assessed in the studies included hospital admissions/re-admissions, mortality, hemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) level, body weight, blood pressure, physical activity level, fatigue, quality of life, and user acceptance of the coaching program and technology. CONCLUSIONS: Telehealth systems that include health coaching have been implemented in older populations as a viable intervention method for managing chronic conditions with mixed results. Health coaching combined with telehealth may be an effective solution for providing health care to older adults. However, health coaching is predominantly performed by human coaches with limited use of technology to augment or replace the human coach. The opportunity exists to expand health coaching to include automated coaching.","Markert, Carl; Sasangohar, Farzan; Mortazavi, Bobak J; Fields, Sherecce",JMIR Hum Factors,https://doi.org/10.2196/23796; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33512322/,475

In the global pandemic continues, the education environment is forced to change from traditional classroom or blended teaching mode to online learning teaching model. With the outbreak of COVID-19, China was the first to announce that online courses are to be implemented in February 2020. In China, whether online learning can replace traditional offline teaching has become a topic worth discussing. Therefore, this study investigates university students in China by questionnaires and discussions of this topic. The study is based on the Push–Pull Mooring model. Based on 854 valid responses collected from an online survey questionnaire, structural equation modeling was employed to examine the research model. The results show that push effects (Perceived security risk, Learning convenience, and Service quality), pull effects (Usefulness, Ease of use, Teacher's Teaching Attitude, Task-technology Fit), and mooring effects (habit) all significantly influence users' switching intentions from offline to online learning platform. Finally, this study explores whether push–pull–mooring can be a reference for promoting and implementing online learning courses in Chinese colleges and universities in the future after the pandemic.","Jin, Yuan Qing; Lin, Chien-Liang; Zhao, Qun; Yu, Sung-Wen; Su, Yu-Sheng",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33776854/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.632787,475
594383,Real-Time Locating System in Production Management,2020-11-26,"Caring for older patients with breast cancer presents unique clinical considerations due to preexisting and competing comorbidity, the potential for treatment-related toxicity, and the consequent impact on functional status. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, treatment decision making for older patients is especially challenging and encourages us to refocus our treatment priorities. While we work to avoid treatment delays and maintain therapeutic benefit, we also need to minimize the risk for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) exposures, myelosuppression, general chemotherapy toxicity, and functional decline. Herein, we propose multidisciplinary care considerations for the aging patient with breast cancer, with the goal to promote a team-based, multidisciplinary treatment approach during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. These considerations remain relevant as we navigate the “new normal” for the approximately 30% of breast cancer patients age 70 years and older who are diagnosed in the United States annually and for the thousands of older patients living with recurrent and/or metastatic disease.","Freedman, Rachel A; Sedrak, Mina S; Bellon, Jennifer R; Block, Caroline C; Lin, Nancy U; King, Tari A; Minami, Christina; VanderWalde, Noam; Jolly, Trevor A; Muss, Hyman B; Winer, Eric P",J Natl Cancer Inst,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32449757/; https://doi.org/10.1093/jnci/djaa079,475

Despite all efforts for finding drugs or vaccines, the key role for the survival of patients is still related to the immune system. Therefore, improving the efficacy and the functionality of the immune system of COVID-19 patients is very crucial. The potential new, non-invasive, FDA-approved biophysical technology that could be considered in this regard is tumor treating fields (TTFields) based on an alternating electric field has great biological effects. TTFields have significant effects in improving the functionality of dendritic cell, and cytotoxic T-cells, and these cells have a major role in defense against viral infection. Hence, applying TTFields could help COVID-19 patients against infection. Additionally, TTFields can reduce viral genomic replication, by reducing the expressions of some of the vital members of DNA replication complex genes from the minichromosome maintenance family (MCMs). These genes not only are involved in DNA replication but it has also been proven that they have a crucial role in viral replication. Also, TTFields suppress the formation of the network of tunneling nanotubes (TNTs) which is knows as filamentous (F)-actin-rich tubular structures. TNTs have a critical role in promoting the spread of viruses through improving viral entry and acting as a protective agent for viral components from immune cells and even pharmaceuticals. Moreover, TTFields enhance autophagy which leads to apoptosis of virally infected cells. Thus, it can be speculated that using TTFields may prove to be a promising approach as a subsidiary treatment of COVID-19.

599788,Short k-mer abundance profiles yield robust machine learning features and accurate classifiers for RNA viruses,2020-09-18,"In the present study, I propose a novel fitting method to describe the outbreak of 2019-nCoV in China. The fitted data were selected carefully from the non-Hubei part and Hubei Province of China respectively. For the non-Hubei part, the time period of data collection corresponds from the beginning of the policy of isolation to present day. But for Hubei Province, the subjects of Wuhan City and Hubei Province were included from the time of admission to the Huoshenshan Hospital to present day in order to ensure that all or the majority of the confirmed and suspected patients were collected for diagnosis and treatment. The employed basic functions for fitting are the hyperbolic tangent functions [Formula: see text] since in these cases the 2019-nCoV is just an epidemic. Subsequently, the 2019-nCoV will initially expand rapidly and tend to disappear. Therefore, the numbers of the accumulative confirmed patients in different cities, provinces and geographical regions will initially increase rapidly and subsequently stabilize to a plateau phase. The selection of the basic functions for fitting is crucial. In the present study, I found that the hyperbolic tangent functions [Formula: see text] could satisfy the aforementioned properties. By this novel method, I can obtain two significant results. They base on the conditions that the rigorous isolation policy is executed continually. Initially, I can predict the numbers very accurately of the cumulative confirmed patients in different cities, provinces and parts in China, notably, in Wuhan City with the smallest relative error estimated to [Formula: see text] , in Hubei Province with the smallest relative error estimated to [Formula: see text] and in the non-Hubei part of China with the smallest relative error of [Formula: see text] 0.195% in the short-term period of infection. In addition, perhaps I can predict the times when the plateau phases will occur respectively in different regions in the long-term period of infection. Generally for the non-Hubei part of China, the plateau phase of the outbreak of the 2019-nCoV will be expected this March or at the end of this February. In the non-Hubei region of China it is expected that the epidemic will cease on the 30th of March 2020 and following this date no new confirmed patient will be expected. The predictions of the time of Inflection Points and maximum NACP for some important regions may be also obtained. A specific plan for the prevention measures of the 2019-nCoV outbreak must be implemented. This will involve the present returning to work and resuming production in China. Based on the presented results, I suggest that the rigorous isolation policy by the government should be executed regularly during daily life and work duties. Moreover, as many as possible the confirmed and suspected cases should be collected to diagnose or treat.","Pei, Lijun",Cogn Neurodyn,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11571-020-09588-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32341718/,475

The assessment and management of these patients constitute a key element to stop dissemination. AIM: To describe the assessment and treatment of asymptomatic infection in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. METHODS: We searched five databases and search engines for preprints/preproofs, up to August 22, 2020. We included cohort, cross-sectional, and case series studies, reporting the assessment and management of asymptomatic individuals. We extracted data on total discharges with negative PCR, length of hospitalization, treatment, and number of patients who remained asymptomatic. A random-effects model with inverse variance method was used to calculate the pooled prevalence. RESULTS: 41 studies (nine cross-sectional studies, five retrospective studies and 27 reports/case series; 647 asymptomatic individuals), were included, of which 47% were male (233/501). The age of patients was between 1month and 73 years. In patients who became symptomatic, length of hospitalization mean was 13.6 days (SD 6.4). Studies used lopinavir/ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine plus ritonavir/lopinavir, hydroxychloroquine with and without azithromycin, ribavirin plus interferon and interferon alfa. The proportion of individuals who remained asymptomatic was 91% (463/588 patients; 95%CI: 78.3%–98.7%); and asymptomatic individuals discharged with negative PCR was 86% (102/124 individuals; 95%CI: 58.4%–100%). CONCLUSIONS: There is no standard treatment for asymptomatic COVID-19 individuals. There are no studies of adequate design to make this decision. It has been shown that most asymptomatic individuals who were followed have recovered, but this cannot be attributed to standard treatment.","Barboza, Joshuan J.; Chambergo-Michilot, Diego; Velasquez-Sotomayor, Mariana; Silva-Rengifo, Christian; Diaz-Arocutipa, Carlos; Caballero-Alvarado, Jose; Garcia-Solorzano, Franko O.; Alarcon-Ruiz, Christoper A.; Albitres-Flores, Leonardo; Malaga, German; Schlagenhauf, Patricia; Rodriguez-Morales, Alfonso J.",Travel Med Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tmaid.2021.102058; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33838319/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1477893921000995; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1477893921000995?v=s5,475

Although evidence is accumulating that climate conditions may positively or negatively influence the scale of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreaks, uncertainty remains concerning the real impact of climate factors on viral transmission. Methods. The number of new daily cases of COVID-19 diagnosed in Verona (Italy) was retrieved from the official website of Veneto Region, while information on daily weather parameters in the same area was downloaded from IlMeteo website, a renowned Italian technological company specialized in weather forecasts. The search period ranged between March 1 to November 11, 2020. The number of new daily COVID-19 cases and meteorological data in Verona were correlated using both univariate and multivariate analysis. Results. The number of daily COVID-19 diagnoses in Verona was positively associated with the number of days in lockdown and humidity, and inversely correlated with mean, min and max temperature, mean wind speed and number of days with rainfall. Days of lockdown, mean air temperature, humidity, mean wind speed and number of days with rainfall remained significantly associated in multivariate analysis. The four weather parameters contributed to explaining 61% of variance in new daily COVID-19 diagnoses. Each 1% increase in air temperature, 1% decrease in humidity, 1 km/h increase in wind speed and day with rainfall were independently associated with 1.0%, 0.3%, 1.2% and 5.4% reduction in new COVID-19 daily diagnoses. A significant difference was observed in values of all-weather parameters recorded in Verona between days with <100 or [≥]100 new daily COVID-19diagnoses. Conclusions. Climate conditions may play an essential role in conditions of viral transmission, and influence the likelihood or course of local outbreaks. Preventive measures, testing policies and hospital preparedness should be reinforced during periods of higher meteorological risk and in local environments with adverse climate conditions.","Mattiuzzi, C.; Henry, B.

This study of influenza‐confirmed hospitalized pediatric patients compared clinical characteristics and complications by age‐group and differences between influenza A and B. METHODS: This was a retrospective study of pediatric inpatients from January 2013 to December 2014. Patients were grouped into: <6 months, 6 months to <5 years, 5‐ to <10‐year and ≥10 years. Complications were classified into neurologic, pulmonary, and other. We also calculated the incidence of hospitalized influenza cases per 100 000 age‐related population. RESULTS: There were a total of 1272 patients with a median age of 37 months. The highest hospitalization rates were in the <6 months age‐group. Majority (75.2%) had no comorbidity; 25.6% had complications: neurologic 11.9%, pulmonary 9.6%, other 4.1%. Patients with other complications were older, male, and had the highest influenza B rates and the longest length of stay. Influenza A comprised 76.9% of cases and had higher complication rates especially neurologic, compared to influenza B. Influenza B patients were older and were more likely to develop other complications. The 6‐month to <5‐year‐age‐group had the highest complication rate (30.6%), especially neurologic. However, ≥10 years old had the highest other complications, ICU/ high‐dependency admissions and influenza B Victoria rates. CONCLUSIONS: Infants <6 months had the highest hospitalization rates for influenza. The 6‐month to <5‐year‐age‐group had the highest complication rate especially neurologic. Influenza A patients were younger, had higher seizure rates and complications compared to influenza B.","Chong, Chia‐Yin; Yung, Chee‐Fu; Gan, Cherie; Thio, Szu‐Tien; Tan, Natalie Woon‐Hui; Tee, Nancy Wen‐Sim; Lin, Cui; Lin, Raymond Tze‐Pin; Thoon, Koh‐Cheng",Influenza Other Respir Viruses,https://doi.org/10.1111/irv.12692; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31608598/,475

As this occupational group treats ever-increasing mental health problems, it is essential to appraise key factors for their mental health. Accordingly, this study aimed to explore burnout of professional psychotherapists. A total of 110 participants completed self-report measures regarding burnout, self-compassion, work–life balance and telepressure. Correlation, regression and moderation analyses were conducted. Both of the burnout components—emotional exhaustion and depersonalisation—were positively associated with weekly working hours and telepressure, and negatively associated with age, self-compassion and work–life balance. Weekly working hours and work–life balance were significant predictors of emotional exhaustion and depersonalisation. Lastly, self-compassion partially mediated the relationship between work–life balance and emotional exhaustion but did not mediate the relationship between work–life balance and depersonalisation. The findings suggest that maintaining high work–life balance is particularly important for the mental health of psychotherapists, protecting them from burnout. Moreover, self-compassion needs to be cultivated to mitigate emotional exhaustion. Mental health care for this occupational group needs to be implemented to achieve sustainable mental health care for workers and the public.","Kotera, Yasuhiro; Maxwell-Jones, Robert; Edwards, Ann-Marie; Knutton, Natalie",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18105308; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34067641/,475

But less is known about the knowledge, protection behavior and anxiety regarding the outbreak among the general population. METHODS: A cross-sectional, population-based online survey was conducted in China and abroad from January 28 to February 1, 2020. Socio-demographic information was collected and knowledge scores, practice scores, anxiety scores and perceived risk were calculated. General linear model and binary logistic regression were used to identify possible associations. RESULTS: We included 9,764 individuals in this study, and 156 (1.6%) were from Hubei Province. The average knowledge score was 4.7 (standard deviation, 1.0) (scored on a 6-point scale); 96.1% maintained hand hygiene, and 90.3% of participants had varying levels of anxiety. People in Hubei Province were the most anxious, followed by those in Beijing and Shanghai. People who had experienced risk behaviors did not pay more attention to wearing masks and hand hygiene. CONCLUSIONS: The public had high awareness on knowledge of COVID-19 outbreak, and a high proportion of people practiced good hand hygiene behavior. Many people claimed anxiety, especially in heavily affected areas during pandemic, suggesting the importance of closing the gap between risk awareness and good practice and conduct psychological counseling to public and patients.","Han, Bingfeng; Zhao, Tianshuo; Liu, Bei; Liu, Hanyu; Zheng, Hui; Wan, Yongmei; Qiu, Jiayi; Zhuang, Hui; Cui, Fuqiang",J Epidemiol,https://doi.org/10.2188/jea.je20200148; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32830167/,475

We fitted a two-strain mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to observed COVID-19 hospital admissions, hospital and ICU bed occupancy, and deaths; SARS-CoV-2 PCR prevalence and seroprevalence; and the relative frequency of VOC 202012/01 in the three most heavily affected NHS England regions (South East, East of England, and London). We estimate that VOC 202012/01 is 56% more transmissible (95% credible interval across three regions 50-74%) than preexisting variants of SARS-CoV-2. We were unable to find clear evidence that VOC 202012/01 results in greater or lesser severity of disease than preexisting variants. Nevertheless, the increase in transmissibility is likely to lead to a large increase in incidence, with COVID-19 hospitalisations and deaths projected to reach higher levels in 2021 than were observed in 2020, even if regional tiered restrictions implemented before 19 December are maintained. Our estimates suggest that control measures of a similar stringency to the national lockdown implemented in England in November 2020 are unlikely to reduce the effective reproduction number Rt to less than 1, unless primary schools, secondary schools, and universities are also closed. We project that large resurgences of the virus are likely to occur following easing of control measures. It may be necessary to greatly accelerate vaccine roll-out to have an appreciable impact in suppressing the resulting disease burden.","Davies, N. G.; Barnard, R. C.; Jarvis, C. I.; Kucharski, A.

One remarkable feature that occurs after (+) RNA virus entry into cells is the remodeling of host endomembranes, leading to the formation of viral replication factories. Recently, rapid progress in three-dimensional (3D) imaging technologies, such as electron tomography (ET) and focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM), has enabled researchers to visualize the novel membrane structures induced by viruses at high resolution. These 3D imaging technologies provide new mechanistic insights into the viral infection cycle.

615001,Artificial intelligence and computational pathology,2021-01-16,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the level of medication adherence and associated factors among Syrian refugees with hypertension in Jordan. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 180 randomly selected Syrian refugees diagnosed with hypertension residing in Zaatari camp, Jordan. The Adherence to Refills and Medications Scale (ARMS) was used to assess adherence to antihypertensive medications. Additional data were collected on sociodemographics, therapy-related factors, patients’ behaviors and knowledge of hypertension disease and therapy, and health system-related factors. Multivariate linear regression was used to assess the association between adherence scores and other variables. RESULTS: The mean (SD) of ARMS scores was 15.7 (2.9). Based on ARMS scores, 22.8% of patients were adherents and 77.2% were non-adherents. Multivariate analysis showed that newly initiated therapy (≤2 years) and illiteracy were both strong predictors of lower adherence with p < 0.001 and p = 0.012, respectively. Other variables that were significantly associated with lower adherence included discontinuation of antihypertensive medications due to side effects (p = 0.032), reporting irregular availability of free antihypertensive medications dispensed by non-governmental organizations (NGOs) (p = 0.024), and dissatisfaction with health services (p = 0.022). CONCLUSION: Suboptimal adherence to antihypertensive medications remains a substantial unmet need among Syrian refugees with hypertension. As illiteracy appears to have a negative impact on adherence levels, educational interventions that promote medication adherence and favorable health behaviors through auditory and visual aids are needed to better reach and engage people with limited literacy skills. Strengthening the pharmaceutical supply chain at various levels is strongly recommended to respond quickly to changes in demand and prevent an indirect negative impact on adherence levels.","Abu Khudair, Sara; Khader, Yousef S; Morrissey, Hana; El-Khatib, Ziad; Sandor, Janos",Patient Prefer Adherence,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34584406/; https://doi.org/10.2147/ppa.s327903,475

Kinetic model of process development",2020-10-10,"Widely available and easily accessible testing for COVID-19 is a cornerstone of pandemic containment strategies. Nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) are the currently accepted standard for sample collection but are limited by their need for collection devices and sampling by trained healthcare professionals. The aim of this study was to compare the performance of saliva to NPS in an outpatient setting. This was a prospective study conducted at three centers, which compared the performance of saliva and NPS samples collected at the time of assessment center visit. Samples were tested by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and sensitivity and overall agreement determined between saliva and NPS. Clinical data was abstracted by chart review for select study participants. Of the 432 paired samples, 46 were positive for SARS-CoV-2, with seven discordant observed between the two sample types (four individuals testing positive only by NPS and three by saliva only). The observed agreement was 98.4% (kappa coefficient 0.91) and a composite reference standard demonstrated sensitivity of 0.91 and 0.93 for saliva and NPS samples, respectively. On average, the Ct values obtained from saliva as compared to NPS were higher by 2.76. This study demonstrates that saliva performs comparably to NPS for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. Saliva was simple to collect, did not require transport media, and could be tested with equipment readily available at most laboratories. The use of saliva as an acceptable alternative to NPS could support the use of widespread surveillance testing for SARS-CoV-2.","Kandel, Christopher; Zheng, Jennifer; McCready, Janine; Serbanescu, Mihaela Anca; Racher, Hilary; Desaulnier, Melissa; Powis, Jeff E; Vojdani, Kyle; Finlay, Laura; Sheldrake, Elena; Vermeiren, Christie; Katz, Kevin; McGeer, Allison; Kozak, Robert; Goneau, Lee W",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v12111314; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33212817/,475

Pyometra was exacerbated during CCRT, and after her first brachytherapy, she presented at our hospital with fever and decreased consciousness level. After admission to the Intensive Care Unit, the patient lost consciousness and experienced frequent seizures; tracheal intubation was required. Whole-body computed tomography revealed pyometra; therefore, transvaginal removal of the abscess was performed. Laboratory tests and vital signs indicated septic shock, and meropenem was administered. L. monocytogenes was detected in the abscess from the uterine cavity and the blood cultures on the third day of hospitalization. A lumbar puncture was performed on the same day to investigate whether the patient had meningitis. A FilmArray meningitis/encephalitis panel test of the spinal fluid revealed L. monocytogenes. After the diagnosis of meningitis with L. monocytogenes, ampicillin and gentamicin were started, and the blood test results gradually improved. Five months after the initial episode, her consciousness recovered, however she still received mechanical ventilatory support.

617972,"GEA Group, Germany",2020-06-30,"It is known that aging decreases natural resistance to viral diseases due to dysfunctional innate and adaptive immune responses, but the nature of these dysfunctions, particularly in regard to innate immunity, is not well understood. We have previously shown that C57BL/6J (B6) mice lose their natural resistance to footpad infection with ectromelia virus (ECTV) due to impaired maturation and recruitment of natural killer (NK) cells to the draining popliteal lymph node (dLN). More recently, we have also shown that in young B6 mice infected with ECTV, the recruitment of NK cells is dependent on a complex cascade whereby migratory dendritic cells (mDCs) traffic from the skin to the dLN, where they produce CCL2 and CCL7 to recruit inflammatory monocytes (iMOs). In the dLN, mDCs also upregulate NKG2D ligands to induce interferon gamma (IFN‐γ) expression by group 1 innate lymphoid cells (G1‐ILCs), mostly NK in cells but also some ILC1. In response to the IFN‐γ, the incoming uninfected iMOs secret CXCL9 to recruit the critical NK cells. Here, we show that in aged B6 mice, the trafficking of mDCs to the dLN in response to ECTV is decreased, resulting in impaired IFN‐γ expression by G1‐ILCs, reduced accumulation of iMOs, and attenuated CXCL9 production by iMOs, which likely contributes to decrease in NK cell recruitment. Together, these data indicate that defects in the mDC response to viral infection during aging result in a reduced innate immune response in the dLN and contribute to increased susceptibility to viral disease in the aged.","Stotesbury, Colby; Wong, Eric B.; Tang, Lingjuan; Montoya, Brian; Knudson, Cory J.; Melo‐Silva, Carolina R.; Sigal, Luis J.",Aging Cell,https://doi.org/10.1111/acel.13170; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32657004/,475

HIF prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors are known to boost endogenous erythropoietin (Epo) and activate erythropoiesis by stabilizing and activating the hypoxia inducible factor (HIF). Recombinant Epo treatment has anti-inflammatory and healing properties, and thus, very likely, will be beneficial for moderate to severe cases of COVID-19. However, HIF PHD inhibition may have a significantly broader effect, in addition to stimulating the endogenous Epo production. The analysis of HIF target genes reveals that some HIF-targets, such as furin, could play a negative role with respect to viral entry. On the other hand, HIF prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors counteract ferroptosis, the process recently implicated in vessel damage during the later stages of COVID-19. Therefore, HIF prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors may serve as a promising treatment of COVID-19 complications, but they are unlikely to aid in the prevention of the initial stages of infection.","Poloznikov, Andrey A.; Nersisyan, Stepan A.; Hushpulian, Dmitry M.; Kazakov, Eliot H.; Tonevitsky, Alexander G.; Kazakov, Sergey V.; Vechorko, Valery I.; Nikulin, Sergey V.; Makarova, Julia A.; Gazaryan, Irina G.",Front Pharmacol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2020.621054; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33584306/,475

Age, pre-existing comorbidities, severity of respiratory failure and the absence of antiviral therapy on admission were identified as independent predictors of 28-day outcome. CONCLUSION: Severity of hypoxaemia on admission, older age (> 70 years), cardiovascular and renal comorbidities were associated with worse outcome in COVID-19 patients. Antiviral treatment on admission was identified as a protective factor for 28-day mortality. Ascertaining the outcomes of critically ill COVID-19 patients is crucial to optimise hospital and ICU resources and provide the appropriate intensity level of care.","Roger, Claire; Collange, Olivier; Mezzarobba, Myriam; Abou-Arab, Osama; Teule, Lauranne; Garnier, Marc; Hoffmann, Clément; Muller, Laurent; Lefrant, Jean-Yves; Guinot, Pierre Grégoire; Novy, Emmanuel; Abraham, Paul; Clavier, Thomas; Bourenne, Jérémy; Besch, Guillaume; Favier, Laurent; Fiani, Michel; Ouattara, Alexandre; Joannes-Boyau, Olivier; Fischer, Marc-Olivier; Leone, Marc; Ait Tamlihat, Younes; Pottecher, Julien; Cordier, Pierre-Yves; Aussant, Philippe; Moussa, Mouhamed Djahoum; Hautin, Etienne; Bouex, Marine; Julia, Jean-Michel; Cady, Julien; Danguy Des Déserts, Marc; Mayeur, Nicolas; Mura, Thibault; Allaouchiche, Bernard",Anaesth Crit Care Pain Med,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352556821001351?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.accpm.2021.100931; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352556821001351; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34256165/,475

However, there are no natural or synthetic compounds currently available that can inhibit SARS-CoV. We examined the inhibitory effects of 64 purified natural compounds against the activity of SARS helicase, nsP13, and the hepatitis C virus (HCV) helicase, NS3h, by conducting fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based double-strand (ds) DNA unwinding assay or by using a colorimetry-based ATP hydrolysis assay. While none of the compounds, examined in our study inhibited the DNA unwinding activity or ATPase activity of human HCV helicase protein, we found that myricetin and scutellarein potently inhibit the SARS-CoV helicase protein in vitro by affecting the ATPase activity, but not the unwinding activity, nsP13. In addition, we observed that myricetin and scutellarein did not exhibit cytotoxicity against normal breast epithelial MCF10A cells. Our study demonstrates for the first time that selected naturally-occurring flavonoids, including myricetin and scultellarein might serve as SARS-CoV chemical inhibitors.","Yu, Mi-Sun; Lee, June; Lee, Jin Moo; Kim, Younggyu; Chin, Young-Won; Jee, Jun-Goo; Keum, Young-Sam; Jeong, Yong-Joo",Bioorg Med Chem Lett,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22578462/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bmcl.2012.04.081; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0960894X12005318; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960894X12005318,475

Despite its paramount significance for the human immune system, many aspects of how the BM enables decade-long immunity against pathogens are still poorly understood. In this review, we discuss the relationship between BM survival niches and long-lasting humoral immunity, how intrinsic and extrinsic factors define memory cell longevity and show that the BM is also capable of adopting many responsibilities of a secondary lymphoid organ. Additionally, with more and more data on the differentiation and maintenance of memory T-cells and plasma cells upon vaccination in humans being reported, we discuss what factors determine the establishment of long-lasting immunological memory in the BM and what we can learn for vaccination technologies and antigen design. Finally, using these insights, we touch on how this holistic understanding of the BM is necessary for the development of modern and efficient vaccines against the pandemic SARS-CoV-2.","Slamanig, Stefan A.; Nolte, Martijn A.",Cells,https://doi.org/10.3390/cells10061508; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34203839/,475

Here, we analyzed over 700 lung transcriptome samples of patients with comorbidities associated with severe COVID-19 and found that ACE2 was highly expressed in these patients, compared to control individuals. This finding suggests that patients with such comorbidities may have higher chances of developing severe COVID-19. Correlation and network analyses revealed many potential regulators of ACE2 in the human lung, including genes related to histone modifications, such as HAT1, HDAC2, and KDM5B.

Drug repurposing screening is regarded as one of the most practical and rapid approaches for the discovery of such therapeutics. The 3C like protease (3CL(pro)), or main protease (M(pro)) of SARS-CoV-2 is a valid drug target as it is a specific viral enzyme and plays an essential role in viral replication. We performed a quantitative high throughput screening (qHTS) of 10,755 compounds consisting of approved and investigational drugs, and bioactive compounds using a SARS-CoV-2 3CL(pro) assay. Twenty-three small molecule inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 3CL(pro) have been identified with IC(50)s ranging from 0.26 to 28.85 μM. Walrycin B (IC(50) = 0.26 μM), Hydroxocobalamin (IC(50) = 3.29 μM), Suramin sodium (IC(50) = 6.5 μM), Z-DEVD-FMK (IC(50) = 6.81 μM), LLL-12 (IC(50) = 9.84 μM), and Z-FA-FMK (IC(50) = 11.39 μM) are the most potent 3CL(pro) inhibitors. The activities of anti-SARS-CoV-2 viral infection was confirmed in 7 of 23 compounds using a SARS-CoV-2 cytopathic effect assay. The results demonstrated a set of SARS-CoV-2 3CL(pro) inhibitors that may have potential for further clinical evaluation as part of drug combination therapies to treating COVID-19 patients, and as starting points for chemistry optimization for new drug development.","Zhu, Wei; Xu, Miao; Chen, Catherine Z.; Guo, Hui; Shen, Min; Hu, Xin; Shinn, Paul; Klumpp-Thomas, Carleen; Michael, Samuel G.; Zheng, Wei",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.17.207019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32803196/,475

The clinical severity of COVID-19 ranges from asymptomatic to critical disease and, eventually, death in smaller subsets of patients. The first case of COVID-19 was declared at the end of 2019 and it has since spread worldwide and remained a challenge in 2021, with the emergence of variants of concern. In fact, new concerns were the still unclear situation of SARS-CoV-2 immunity during the ongoing pandemic and progress with vaccination. If maintained at sufficiently high levels, the immune response could effectively block reinfection, which might confer long-lived protection. Understanding the protective capacity and the duration of humoral immunity during SARS-CoV-2 infection or after vaccination is critical for managing the pandemic and would also provide more evidence about the efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. However, the exact features of antibody responses that govern SARS-CoV-2 infection or after vaccination remain unclear. This review summarizes the main knowledge that we have about the humoral immune response during COVID-19 disease or after vaccination.

631326,"Pregnancy outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada, March to August 2020.",2021-07-28,"While bats are often viewed as carriers of infectious disease agents, little research has been conducted on the effects these potential pathogens may have on the bat populations themselves. The southern bent-winged bat (Miniopterus orianae bassanii) is a critically endangered subspecies endemic to south-eastern Australia. Population numbers of this bat have been declining for the past 50 years, but the reasons for this are unclear. As part of a larger study to determine if disease could be a contributing factor to this decline, 351 southern bent-winged bats from four locations were captured, and oral swabs were collected and tested for the presence of potentially pathogenic viruses. Results were compared with those obtained from 116 eastern bent-winged bats (Miniopterus orianae oceanensis) from three different locations. The eastern bent-winged bat is a related but more common and widespread subspecies whose geographical range overlaps partly with southern bent-winged bats. Herpesviruses were detected in bent-winged bats from all seven locations. At least six novel herpesviruses (five betaherpesviruses and one gammaherpesvirus) were identified. The prevalence of herpesvirus infection was higher in eastern bent-winged bats (44%, 51/116), compared to southern bent-winged bats (27%, 95/351), although this varied across the locations and sampling periods. Adenoviruses and a range of different RNA viruses (lyssaviruses, filoviruses, coronaviruses and henipaviruses) were also tested for but not detected. The detected herpesviruses did not appear to be associated with obvious ill health, and may thus not be playing a role in the population decline of the southern bent-winged bat. The detection of multiple novel herpesviruses at a high prevalence of infection is consistent with our understanding of bats as hosts to a rich diversity of viruses.","Holz, Peter H.; Lumsden, Linda F.; Druce, Julian; Legione, Alistair R.; Vaz, Paola; Devlin, Joanne M.; Hufschmid, Jasmin",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29795610/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0197625,475

634528,Optimal test-kit based intervention strategy of epidemic spreading in heterogeneous complex networks,2020-10-15,"BACKGROUND: Systematic reviews involve searching multiple bibliographic databases to identify eligible studies. As this type of evidence synthesis is increasingly pursued, the use of various electronic platforms can help researchers improve the efficiency and quality of their research. We examined the accuracy and efficiency of commonly used electronic methods for flagging and removing duplicate references during this process. METHODS: A heterogeneous sample of references was obtained by conducting a similar topical search in MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and PsycINFO databases. References were de-duplicated via manual abstraction to create a benchmark set. The default settings were then used in Ovid multifile search, EndNote desktop, Mendeley, Zotero, Covidence, and Rayyan to de-duplicate the sample of references independently. Using the benchmark set as reference, the number of false-negative and false-positive duplicate references for each method was identified, and accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were determined. RESULTS: We found that the most accurate methods for identifying duplicate references were Ovid, Covidence, and Rayyan. Ovid and Covidence possessed the highest specificity for identifying duplicate references, while Rayyan demonstrated the highest sensitivity. CONCLUSION: This study reveals the strengths and weaknesses of commonly used de-duplication methods and provides strategies for improving their performance to avoid unintentionally removing eligible studies and introducing bias into systematic reviews. Along with availability, ease-of-use, functionality, and capability, these findings are important to consider when researchers are selecting database platforms and supporting software programs for conducting systematic reviews.","McKeown, Sandra; Mir, Zuhaib M",Syst Rev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33485394/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13643-021-01583-y,475

Although neurons of the PFC are generated before birth, the differentiation of its neurons and development of synaptic connections in humans extend to the 3rd decade of life. During this period, synapses as well as neurotransmitter systems including their receptors and transporters, are initially overproduced followed by selective elimination. Advanced methods applied to human and animal models, enable investigation of the cellular mechanisms and role of specific genes, non-coding regulatory elements and signaling molecules in control of prefrontal neuronal production and phenotypic fate, as well as neuronal migration to establish layering of the PFC. Likewise, various genetic approaches in combination with functional assays and immunohistochemical and imaging methods reveal roles of neurotransmitter systems during maturation of the PFC. Disruption, or even a slight slowing of the rate of neuronal production, migration and synaptogenesis by genetic or environmental factors, can induce gross as well as subtle changes that eventually can lead to cognitive impairment. An understanding of the development and evolution of the PFC provide insight into the pathogenesis and treatment of congenital neuropsychiatric diseases as well as idiopathic developmental disorders that cause intellectual disabilities.","Kolk, Sharon M.; Rakic, Pasko",Neuropsychopharmacology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34645980/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41386-021-01137-9,475

Our survey found that in addition to porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV), PDCoV has also been a causative enteric pathogen of diarrhoeic outbreaks occurring at swine farms around Japan since late 2013. Phylogenetic analysis using the complete genomes of PDCoVs detected in Japan in 2014 demonstrated that the PDCoVs from Japan may be closely related to the PDCoVs from the U.S. and Korea during 2013 to 2014 but not the PDCoVs from China and Hong Kong during 2004 to 2016 and from Thailand, Vietnam and Laos during 2015 to 2016. To investigate the pathogenicity of a representative Japanese PDCoV, we performed an experimental infection using hysterectomy-produced colostrum-deprived piglets. The PDCoV-inoculated piglets showed acute, watery diarrhoea, but all recovered and survived. In addition, all piglets inoculated with the Japanese PDCoV exhibited virus shedding at high level in faeces and viremia corresponding to their clinical symptoms. In the PDCoV-inoculated group, viruses were mainly detected from jejunums to colons by a quantitative PDCoV-specific PCR and microscopic observation. These findings would provide useful information for establishing a diagnostic methodology for distinguishing diarrhoea caused by PDCoV from that caused by other enteric pathogens, such as PEDV.","Suzuki, Tohru; Shibahara, Tomoyuki; Imai, Naoto; Yamamoto, Takehisa; Ohashi, Seiichi",Infect Genet Evol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567134818301722; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2018.03.030; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134818301722; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29621617/,475

Although stimulated by physiological hypoxia, pulmonary hypoxic patients usually develop anemia, which may ultimately complicate the outcome. To characterize this non-adaptive response, we dissected the interplay among the redox state, iron regulation, and inflammation in patients challenged by either acute (ARDS and COVID-19) or chronic (COPD) hypoxia. To this purpose, we evaluated a panel of redox state biomarkers that may integrate the routine iron metabolism assays to monitor the patients’ inflammatory and oxidative state. We measured redox and hematopoietic regulators in 20 ARDS patients, 20 ambulatory COPD patients, 9 COVID-19 ARDS-like patients, and 10 age-matched non-hypoxic healthy volunteers (controls). All the examined pathological conditions induced hypoxia, with ARDS and COVID-19 depressing the hematopoietic response without remarkable effects on erythropoietin. Free iron was higher than the controls in all patients, with higher levels of hepcidin and soluble transferrin receptor in ARDS and COVID-19. All markers of the redox state and antioxidant barrier were overexpressed in ARDS and COVID-19. However, glutathionyl hemoglobin, a candidate marker for the redox imbalance, was especially low in ARDS, despite depressed levels of glutathione being present in all patients. Although iron regulation was dysfunctional in all groups, the depressed antioxidant barrier in ARDS, and to a lesser extent in COVID-19, might induce greater inflammatory responses with consequent anemia.","Duca, Lorena; Ottolenghi, Sara; Coppola, Silvia; Rinaldo, Rocco; Dei Cas, Michele; Rubino, Federico Maria; Paroni, Rita; Samaja, Michele; Chiumello, Davide Alberto; Motta, Irene",Antioxidants (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/antiox10091460; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34573092/,475

Healthcare providers, community activists, politicians, members of faith-based organizations, professional athletes, and Black families are asking crucial questions about why Black and Brown people are disproportionately infected by, and dying from, the COVID-19. Evidence in healthcare and social sciences literature demonstrates that historically, systemic racism and injustices play a large role in the health and well-being of Blacks living in the USA. For decades, the National Black Nurses Association has been on the forefront, engaging our people using a collaborative community-based practice model. The healthcare goal in the USA should center on health protection, promotion, and prevention, moving toward a wellness model and away from treatment of illnesses that contribute to healthcare waste. Finally, awareness of social determinants of health has taken center stage, demonstrating how laws, policies, and practice affect health outcomes and the well-being of Black and Brown communities. In order to address social determinants of health and healthcare inequity, the National Black Nurses Association has called for an increase in the number of Black registered nurses and licensed vocational and practical nurses. The healthcare goal in the USA should center on health protection, promotion, and preventions moving toward a wellness model and away from treatment of illnesses that contributes to healthcare waste.","Dawson, Martha A.",J Racial Ethn Health Disparities,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40615-021-00987-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33580471/,475

Remdesivir is the only COVID-19 treatment approved by U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA); however, its effectiveness is still under questioning as raised by the results of a large WHO Solidarity Trial. Herein, we report that the parent nucleotide of remdesivir, GS-441524, potently inhibits the replication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Vero E6 and other cells. It exhibits good plasma distribution and longer half-life (t1/2=4.8h) in rat PK study. GS-441524 is highly efficacious against SARS-CoV-2 in AAV-hACE2 transduced mice and murine hepatitis virus (MHV) in mice, reducing the viral titers in CoV-attacked organs, without noticeable toxicity. Given that GS-441524 was the predominant metabolite of remdesivir in the plasma, the anti-COVID-19 effect of remdesivir may partly come from the effect of GS-441524. Our results also supported that GS-441524 as a promising and inexpensive drug candidate in the treatment of COVID-19 and future emerging CoVs diseases.","Li, Yingjun; Cao, Liu; Li, Ge; Cong, Feng; Li, Yunfeng; Sun, Jing; Luo, Yinzhu; Chen, Guijiang; Li, Guanguan; Wang, Ping; Xing, Fan; Ji, Yanxi; Zhao, Jincun; Zhang, Yu; Guo, Deyin; Zhang, Xumu",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.26.353300,475

An important part of this research has been focused on randomized controlled clinical trials to evaluate potential therapies for COVID-19. The results from this research need to be obtained as rapidly as possible. This presents a number of challenges associated with considerable uncertainty over the natural history of the disease and the number and characteristics of patients affected, and the emergence of new potential therapies. These challenges make adaptive designs for clinical trials a particularly attractive option. Such designs allow a trial to be modified on the basis of interim analysis data or stopped as soon as sufficiently strong evidence has been observed to answer the research question, without compromising the trial’s scientific validity or integrity. In this article, we describe some of the adaptive design approaches that are available and discuss particular issues and challenges associated with their use in the pandemic setting.

One of the most significant impacts to people is the fear of contacting the SARS virus while engaging daily routine activity. Here we use data from daily underground ridership in Taipei City and daily reported new SARS cases in Taiwan to model the dynamics of the public fear of the SARS virus during the wax and wane of the SARS period. We found that for each reported new SARS case there is an immediate loss of about 1200 underground ridership (the fresh fear). These daily loss rates dissipate to the following days with an e-folding time of about 28 days, reflecting the public perception on the risk of contacting SARS virus when traveling with the underground system (the residual fear). About 50% of daily ridership was lost during the peak of the 2003 SARS period, compared with the loss of 80% daily ridership during the closure of the underground system after Typhoon Nari, the loss of 50–70% ridership due to the closure of the governmental offices and schools during typhoon periods, and the loss of 60% daily ridership during Chinese New Year holidays.","Wang, Kuo-Ying",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24647278/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0089405,475
641683,Mixed-Stable Models: An Application to High-Frequency Financial Data,2021-06-11,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 outbreak has induced negative emotions among people. These emotions are expressed by the public on social media and are rapidly spread across the internet, which could cause high levels of panic among the public. Understanding the changes in public sentiment on social media during the pandemic can provide valuable information for developing appropriate policies to reduce the negative impact of the pandemic on the public. Previous studies have consistently shown that the COVID-19 outbreak has had a devastating negative impact on public sentiment. However, it remains unclear whether there has been a variation in the public sentiment during the recovery phase of the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aim to determine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in mainland China by continuously tracking public sentiment on social media throughout 2020. METHODS: We collected 64,723,242 posts from Sina Weibo, China’s largest social media platform, and conducted a sentiment analysis based on natural language processing to analyze the emotions reflected in these posts. RESULTS: We found that the COVID-19 pandemic not only affected public sentiment on social media during the initial outbreak but also induced long-term negative effects even in the recovery period. These long-term negative effects were no longer correlated with the number of new confirmed COVID-19 cases both locally and nationwide during the recovery period, and they were not attributed to the postpandemic economic recession. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic induced long-term negative effects on public sentiment in mainland China even as the country recovered from the pandemic. Our study findings remind public health and government administrators of the need to pay attention to public mental health even once the pandemic has concluded.","Tan, Hao; Peng, Sheng-Lan; Zhu, Chun-Peng; You, Zuo; Miao, Ming-Cheng; Kuai, Shu-Guang",J Med Internet Res,https://doi.org/10.2196/29150; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34280118/,475

The author explains why pastoral visitation should be considered essential care—especially at a time of crisis—and encourages hospital administrators across the country to clarify policies to welcome community clergy as essential personnel, but to do so with prudent procedures that mitigate risk to the community and to the visiting clergy. Given the fact that most hospitals in this country were founded by religious organizations and still carry the imprint of that founding in their names, it would be tragic for these very same hospitals to cut patients off from their religious communities precisely at the time they need them most.

644030,A Novel Crowdsourcing Model for Micro-Mobility Ride-Sharing Systems,2021-07-06,"BACKGROUND: Office blood pressure (OBP) measurement is the most common method of blood pressure measurement. However, it is associated with several pitfalls as white coat effect and masked hypertension. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) is usually used for diagnosis of hypertension and elimination of white coat effect. This study aimed to assess the correlation and degree of agreement of the automated sequential blood pressure (ASqBP) with OBP and ABPM. Patients presented to hypertension clinic were included. Each patient had his blood pressure recorded by three methods: OBP using a digital sphygmomanometer device, unattended ASqBP using sequential BP devices with recording of the readings over 30 min, and ABPM that was performed within 48 h of office visit using portable BP devices with BP recording over 24 h. RESULTS: We recruited 64 patients (age 50.0 ± 15.0 years and female gender 53.1%). We found a strong positive correlation between ASqBP and OBP readings (r 0.81 for SBP and 0.83 for DBP, p < 0.001). We also found a strong positive correlation between ASqBP and ABPM readings (r 0.74, p < 0.001). The ASqBP readings were lower than OBP (137.0 ± 16.8/86.4 ± 13.8 vs. 142.7 ± 15.5/88.5 ± 12.3) and close to ABPM readings (average 24 h, 134.0 ± 15.4/88.5 ± 12.3, and daytime, 135.8 ± 15.7/82.1 ± 13.7). For SBP readings, there was moderate agreement between ASqBP and AMBP (both average and daytime). For DBP readings, there was fair agreement between ASqBP and AMBP (both average and daytime). CONCLUSION: ASqBP measurement has good correlation with OBP and ABPM readings. Unattended automated office pressure has moderate degree of agreement with ABPM for the SBP& fair degree of agreement for the DBP. It can be used in the hypertension clinics to eliminate the problems of white coat effect and marked BP variability.","Mahmoud, Kareem; ElAroussy, Ayah; Baghdady, Yasser; ElAroussy, Wafaa; ElDeeb, Heba",Egypt Heart J,https://doi.org/10.1186/s43044-020-00087-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32804322/,475

This has been invaluable in deciphering the normal and disease states in cell biology; the key shortcomings of it being suitability for translational or clinical correlations. The past decade has seen several major advances in organoid culture technologies and this has enhanced our understanding of mimicking organ reconstruction. The term organoid has generally been used to describe cellular aggregates derived from primary tissues or stem cells that can self-organize into organotypic structures. Organoids mimic the cellular microenvironment of tissues better than 2D cell culture systems and represent the tissue physiology. Human organoids of brain, thyroid, gastrointestinal, lung, cardiac, liver, pancreatic and kidney have been established from various diseases, healthy tissues and from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs). Advances in patient-derived organoid culture further provides a unique perspective from which treatment modalities can be personalized. In this review article, we have discussed the current strategies for establishing various types of organoids of ectodermal, endodermal and mesodermal origin. We have also discussed their applications in modeling human health and diseases (such as cancer, genetic, neurodegenerative and infectious diseases), applications in regenerative medicine and evolutionary studies.","Shankaran, Abhijith; Prasad, Keshava; Chaudhari, Sima; Brand, Angela; Satyamoorthy, Kapaettu",3 Biotech,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33977021/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s13205-021-02815-7,475

The results show that different sets of neighborhood characteristics were independently associated with COVID-19 testing, case, and death rates. For example, the proportions of Blacks and Hispanics in a ZCTA were positively associated with COVID-19 case rate. Contrary to the conventional hypothesis, neighborhoods with low-density housing experienced higher COVID-19 case rates. In addition, demographic changes (e.g. out-migration) during the pandemic may bias the estimates of COVID-19 rates. Future research should further investigate these neighborhood-level factors and their interactions over time to better understand the mechanisms by which they affect COVID-19.","Kim, Byoungjun; Rundle, Andrew G.; Goodwin, Alicia T.Singham; Morrison, Christopher N.; Branas, Charles C.; El-Sadr, Wafaa; Duncan, Dustin T.",Health Place,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healthplace.2021.102539; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1353829221000356; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33639446/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1353829221000356?v=s5,475

This systematic review aimed to summarize the evidence on COVID-19 patients with HBV or HCV co-infections. Methods: We searched multiple electronic databases and preprint servers from December 1, 2019 to August 9, 2020. Studies were included if they reported quantitative empirical data on COVID- 19 patients with HBV or HCV co-infections. Descriptive analyses were reported and data were narratively synthesized. Quality assessments was completed using the Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tools. Results: Out of the 941 identified records, 28 studies were included. Of the eligible studies, 235 patients with COVID-19 were infected with HBV and 22 patients with HCV. Most patients were male and mean age was 49.8 and 62.8 in patients with HBV and HCV, respectively. Death proportion was 6% among COVID-19-HBV and 13% among COVID-19-HCV co-infected patients. Among COVID-19 patients, 34.1% and 76.2% reported at least one comorbidity besides HBV and HCV infections, mainly hypertension and diabetes mellites type 2. The most common COVID-19-related symptoms in both HBV and HCV groups were fever, cough and dyspnea. ICU admission was reported in 14.1% and 21.4% of individuals with HBV and HCV, respectively. Conclusions: Our findings suggest a considerable risk of morbidity and mortality among COVID-19 patients with HBV and HCV.

652945,A two diffusion stochastic model for the spread of the new corona virus SARS-CoV-2,2021-04-30,"Fungal infections represent a global problem, notably for immunocompromised patients in hospital, COVID-19 patient wards and care home settings, and the ever-increasing emergence of multidrug resistant fungal strains is a sword of Damocles hanging over many healthcare systems. Azoles represent the mainstay of antifungal drugs, and their mode of action involves the binding mode of these molecules to the fungal lanosterol 14α-demethylase target enzyme. In this study, we have prepared and characterized four novel organometallic derivatives of the frontline antifungal drug fluconazole (1a–4a). Very importantly, enzyme inhibition and chemogenomic profiling demonstrated that lanosterol 14α-demethylase, as for fluconazole, was the main target of the most active compound of the series, (N-(ferrocenylmethyl)-2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-2-hydroxy-N-methyl-3-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)propan-1-aminium chloride, 2a). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies suggested that 2a induced a loss in cell wall integrity as well as intracellular features ascribable to late apoptosis or necrosis. The impressive activity of 2a was further confirmed on clinical isolates, where antimycotic potency up to 400 times higher than fluconazole was observed. Also, 2a showed activity towards azole-resistant strains. This finding is very interesting since the primary target of 2a is the same as that of fluconazole, emphasizing the role played by the organometallic moiety. In vivo experiments in a mice model of Candida infections revealed that 2a reduced the fungal growth and dissemination but also ameliorated immunopathology, a finding suggesting that 2a is active in vivo with added activity on the host innate immune response.","Rubbiani, Riccardo; Weil, Tobias; Tocci, Noemi; Mastrobuoni, Luciano; Jeger, Severin; Moretto, Marco; Ng, James; Lin, Yan; Hess, Jeannine; Ferrari, Stefano; Kaech, Andres; Young, Luke; Spencer, John; Moore, Anthony L.; Cariou, Kevin; Renga, Giorgia; Pariano, Marilena; Romani, Luigina; Gasser, Gilles",RSC chemical biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34458840/; https://doi.org/10.1039/d1cb00123j,475

654844,Home-Use and Real-Time Sleep-Staging System Based on Eye Masks and Mobile Devices with a Deep Learning Model,2021-09-04,"OBJECTIVES: Rates of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) infections have rapidly increased worldwide and reached pandemic proportions. A suite of preventive behaviours have been recommended to minimize risk of COVID‐19 infection in the general population. The present study utilized an integrated social cognition model to explain COVID‐19 preventive behaviours in a sample from the Iranian general population. DESIGN: The study adopted a three‐wave prospective correlational design. METHODS: Members of the general public (N = 1,718, M (age) = 33.34, SD = 15.77, male = 796, female = 922) agreed to participate in the study. Participants completed self‐report measures of demographic characteristics, intention, attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioural control, and action self‐efficacy at an initial data collection occasion. One week later, participants completed self‐report measures of maintenance self‐efficacy, action planning and coping planning, and, a further week later, measures of COVID‐19 preventive behaviours. Hypothesized relationships among social cognition constructs and COVID‐19 preventive behaviours according to the proposed integrated model were estimated using structural equation modelling. RESULTS: The proposed model fitted the data well according to multiple goodness‐of‐fit criteria. All proposed relationships among model constructs were statistically significant. The social cognition constructs with the largest effects on COVID‐19 preventive behaviours were coping planning (β = .575, p < .001) and action planning (β = .267, p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Current findings may inform the development of behavioural interventions in health care contexts by identifying intervention targets. In particular, findings suggest targeting change in coping planning and action planning may be most effective in promoting participation in COVID‐19 preventive behaviours. STATEMENT OF CONTRIBUTION: What is already known on this subject? Curbing COVID‐19 infections globally is vital to reduce severe cases and deaths in at‐risk groups. Preventive behaviours like handwashing and social distancing can stem contagion of the coronavirus. Identifying modifiable correlates of COVID‐19 preventive behaviours is needed to inform intervention. What does this study add? An integrated model identified predictors of COVID‐19 preventive behaviours in Iranian residents. Prominent predictors were intentions, planning, self‐efficacy, and perceived behavioural control. Findings provide insight into potentially modifiable constructs that interventions can target. Research should examine if targeting these factors lead to changes in COVID‐19 behaviours over time.","Lin, Chung‐Ying; Imani, Vida; Majd, Nilofar Rajabi; Ghasemi, Zahra; Griffiths, Mark D.; Hamilton, Kyra; Hagger, Martin S.; Pakpour, Amir H.",Br J Health Psychol,https://doi.org/10.1111/bjhp.12465; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32780891/,475

656812,Machine Learning Methods in Drug Discovery,2020-11-12,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: This work assesses milk and meat price fluctuations from small ruminants during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) crisis in Spain, using official data provided by the Interprofessional Dairy Organization (InLaC) and a representative sample of agricultural markets fixing prices per kilogram of lamb and goat kid meat. Data showed a drop in meat and goat milk prices during the period of confinement, which is only maintained for goat milk over the three following months. Similarly, analysis of data from the most important production areas, involving three protected geographical indications (PGI) of lamb meat, suggested that this quality label had a beneficial effect on sales and price stability in times of crisis. On the other hand, despite the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Spanish labor market, the small ruminant sector did not seem to be affected in terms of the number of workers when comparing the period before and after the pandemic. All these factors are of interest for producers when making decisions regarding the management of flocks and adapting their marketing strategies for a down market or unexpected volatile circumstances. ABSTRACT: Official milk prices in the Spanish small ruminant sector were used for 5 years (2015–2019) to analyze the effect caused by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) crisis in 2020. Meat price fluctuations were also studied using the weekly prices officially provided by some of the main agrarian markets of the country (n = 6) in 2019 and 2020. Moreover, the sales and prices of three protected geographical indications (PGI) of lamb meat served to study the marketability when the products are sold or not under these quality labels in a crisis context. According to Spanish Government’s official communications, 2020 was divided in three periods of study (pre-COVID-19, total confinement and post-confinement). The evolution of employment in this subsector in 2020, as a direct consequence of this crisis, was also analyzed considering data provided by producers. Results showed an intra-annual seasonal effect for milk prices in 2020 for both livestock species, as observed in previous years. However, a negative economic impact on goat milk prices due to the pandemic was checked during the confinement and post-confinement months. Sheep milk prices remained stable. Lamb and goat kid meat prices showed a similar trend in comparison with 2019 during the pre-COVID-19 period. The total confinement period recorded a short interval of 1–2 weeks in which the prices declined, before the suspension of quotations in many markets. In contrast, once confinement was completed, meat prices for both ruminant species rapidly reached levels that existed before the coronavirus crisis. Overall data suggested the protective effect of the PGI marks on lamb meat. Lambs with a PGI had better 2020 prices than non-PGI lambs (+8%), regardless of the period analyzed. Moreover, with fewer lambs sold in 2020, there was a relevant drop in sales of non-PGI lambs vs. PGI (−19% vs. −2%) during the first 7 months. Finally, there was little or no readjustment of the workforce in the small ruminant flocks.","Vidaurreta, Irene; Orengo, Juan; de la Fe, Christian; González, José María; Gómez-Martín, Ángel; Benito, Bernardino",Animals (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33256168/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ani10122221,475

However, an information-based solution for industry reopening is ineffective when the necessary operational information is locked up in disparate real-time data silos. There is a lot of ongoing effort to combat the COVID-19 pandemic using different combinations of low-cost, location-based contact tracing, and sensing technologies. These ad hoc Internet of Things (IoT) solutions for COVID-19 were developed using different data models and protocols without an interoperable way to interconnect these heterogeneous systems and exchange data on people and place interactions. This research aims to design and develop an interoperable Internet of COVID-19 Things (IoCT) architecture that is able to exchange, aggregate, and reuse disparate IoT sensor data sources in order for informed decisions to be made after understanding the real-time risks in workplaces based on person-to-place interactions. The IoCT architecture is based on the Sensor Web paradigm that connects various Things, Sensors, and Datastreams with an indoor geospatial data model. This paper presents a study of what, to the best of our knowledge, is the first real-world integrated implementation of the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) and IndoorGML standards to calculate the risk of COVID-19 online using a workplace reopening case study. The proposed IoCT offers a new open standard-based information model, architecture, methodologies, and software tools that enable the interoperability of disparate COVID-19 monitoring systems with finer spatial-temporal granularity. A workplace cleaning use case was developed in order to demonstrate the capabilities of this proposed IoCT architecture. The implemented IoCT architecture included proximity-based contact tracing, people density sensors, a COVID-19 risky behavior monitoring system, and the contextual building geospatial data.","Liang, Steve H.

The QSAR analysis developed on multivariate GA–MLR (Genetic Algorithm–Multilinear Regression) model with acceptable statistical performance (R(2) = 0.898, Q(2)loo = 0.859, etc.). QSAR analysis attributed the good correlation with different types of atoms like non-ring Carbons and Nitrogens, amide Nitrogen, sp(2)-hybridized Carbons, etc. Thus, the QSAR model has a good balance of qualitative and quantitative requirements (balanced QSAR model) and satisfies the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) guidelines. After that, a QSAR-based virtual screening of 26,467 food compounds and 360 heterocyclic variants of molecule 1 (benzotriazole–indole hybrid molecule) helped to identify promising hits. Furthermore, the molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of Mpro with molecule 1 recognized the structural motifs with significant stability. Molecular docking and QSAR provided consensus and complementary results. The validated analyses are capable of optimizing a drug/lead candidate for better inhibitory activity against the main protease of SARS-CoV-2.","Zaki, Magdi E.

The cellular regulation of IBV pathogenesis and the host immune responses involved remain to be fully elucidated. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as a class of crucial regulators of numerous cellular processes, including responses to viral infections. Here, we employed a high-throughput sequencing approach to analyze the miRNA composition of the spleen and the lungs of chicken embryos upon IBV infection. Compared to healthy chicken embryos, 13 and six miRNAs were upregulated in the spleen and the lungs, respectively, all predicted to influence viral transcription, cytokine production, and lymphocyte functioning. Subsequent downregulation of NFATC3, NFAT5, SPPL3, and TGFB2 genes in particular was observed only in the spleen, demonstrating the biological functionality of the miRNAs in this lymphoid organ. This is the first study that describes the modulation of miRNAs and the related host immune factors by IBV in chicken embryos. Our data provide novel insight into complex virus-host interactions and specifically highlight components that could affect the host’s immune response to IBV infection.

To explain this phenomenon, this study aims to test the predictions of the Compensation Related Utilization of Neural Circuits Hypothesis (CRUNCH) focusing on task demands in aging as a possible framework. The CRUNCH effect would manifest itself in semantic tasks through a compensatory increase in neural activation in semantic control network regions but only up to a certain threshold of task demands. This study will compare 40 young (20–35 years old) with 40 older participants (60–75 years old) in a triad-based semantic judgment task performed in an fMRI scanner while manipulating levels of task demands (low vs. high) through semantic distance.

666047,Pflege Perspektiven,2020-07-06,"There is strong interest globally amidst the current COVID-19 pandemic in tracing contacts of infectious patients using mobile technologies, both as a warning system to individuals and as a targeted intervention strategy for governments. Several governments, including India, have introduced mobile apps for this purpose, which give a warning when the individual's phone establishes bluetooth contact with the phone of an infected person. We present a methodology to probabilistically evaluate risk of infection given the network of contacts that individuals are likely to encounter in real life. Instead of binary ""infected"" or ""uninfected"" statuses, an infection risk probability is maintained which can be efficiently calculated based on probabilities of recent contacts, and updated when a recent contact is diagnosed with a disease. We demonstrate on realistic networks that this method sharply outperforms a naive immediate-contact method even in an ideal circumstance that all infected persons are known to the naive method. We demonstrate robustness to missing contact information (such as when phones fail to make bluetooth contact or the app is not installed). We show, within our model, a strong flattening of the infectious peak when even a small fraction of cases are identified, tested and isolated. In the real world, where most known-infected persons are isolated or quarantined and where many individuals may not carry their mobiles in public, we believe the improvement offered by our method warrants consideration. Importantly, in view of widespread concerns on privacy and contact-tracing, our method relies mainly on direct contact data that can be stored locally on users' phones, and uses limited communication via intermediary servers only upon testing, mitigating privacy concerns.","Guttal, V.; Krishna, S.; Siddharthan, R.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.26.20080648v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.26.20080648,475

Few studies on this subject are found in the municipal nursing home setting, and causes need to be identified. The aim of this study was to explore perceptions of errors connected to medication management in nursing homes by exploring the perspective of first-line registered nurses, registered nurses, and non-licensed staff involved in the care of older persons. METHODS: A qualitative research approach was applied based on semi-structured interviews with 21 participants at their workplaces: Seven in each of the occupational categories of first-line registered nurses, registered nurses, and non-licensed staff. Subcategories were derived from transcribed interviews by content analysis and categorized according to the Man, Technology, and Organization concept of error causation, which is as a framework to identify errors. RESULTS: Mistakes in medication management were commonly perceived as a result of human shortcomings and deficiencies in working conditions such as the lack of safe tools to facilitate and secure medication management. The delegation of drug administration to non-licensed staff, the abandonment of routines, carelessness, a lack of knowledge, inadequate verbal communication between colleagues, and a lack of understanding of the difficulties involved in handling the drugs were all considered as risk areas for errors. Organizational hazards were related to the ability to control the delegation, the standard of education, and safety awareness among staff members. Safety issues relating to technology involved devices for handling prescription cards and when staff were not included in the development process of new technological aids. A lack of staff and the lack of time to act safely in the care of the elderly were also perceived as safety hazards, particularly with the non-licensed staff working in nursing homes. CONCLUSIONS: The staff working in nursing homes perceive that the risks due to medication management are mainly caused by human limitations or technical deficiencies. Organizational factors, such as working conditions, can often facilitate the occurrence of malpractice. To minimize mistakes, care managers need to have a systemwide perspective on safety issues, where organizational issues are essential.","Bengtsson, Mariette; Ekedahl, Ann-Britt Ivarsson; Sjöström, Karin",BMC Nurs,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12912-021-00587-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33926436/,475

This and the challenging environment onboard (boat movements, limited space) might influence Basic Life Support (BLS) performance. The primary objective of this study was to assess the impact of the protective gear on single-rescuer BLS-quality. Material and Methods: Sixty-five active KNRM crewmembers who had recently undergone a BLS-refresher course were randomized to wear either their protective gear (n = 32) or their civilian clothes (n = 33; control group) and performed five 2-min sessions of single rescuer BLS on a mannequin on dry land. BLS-quality was assessed according to Dutch and European Resuscitation guidelines. A between group analysis (Mann-Whitney U) and a repeated within group analysis of both groups (Friedman test) were performed. Results: There were no major demographic differences between the groups. The protective gear did not significant impair BLS-quality. It was also not associated with a significant increase in the perceived exertion of BLS (Borg's Rating scale). Compression depth, compression frequency, the percentage of correct compression depth and of not leaning on the thorax, and ventilation volumes in both groups were suboptimal when evaluated according to the BLS-guidelines. Conclusions: The protective gear worn by KNRM lifeboat-crewmembers does not have a significant influence on BLS-quality under controlled study conditions. The impact and significance on outcome in real life situations needs to be studied further. This study provides valuable input for optimizing the BLS-skills of lifeboat crewmembers.","Venema, Allart M.; Sahinovic, Marko M.; Ramaker, Albert J. D. W.

However, the therapeutic effect of remdesivir is controversial. METHODS We searched PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, from inception to June 11, 2020 for randomized controlled trials on the clinical efficacy of remdesivir. The main outcomes were discharge rate, mortality, and adverse events. This study is registered at INPLASY (INPLASY202060046). RESULTS Data of 1075 subjects showed that remdesivir significantly increased the discharge rate of patients with COVID-19 compared with the placebo (50.4% vs. 45.29%; relative risk [RR] 1.19 [95% confidence interval [CI], 1.05-1.34], I2 = 0.0%, P = 0.754). It also significantly decreased mortality (8.18% vs. 12.70%; RR 0.64 [95% CI, 0.44-0.92], I2 = 45.7%, P = 0.175) compared to the placebo.

Whether the effectiveness of corticosteroids differs according to serum ferritin level in COVID-19 has not been reported. Objective: To examine the association between admission serum ferritin level and methylprednisolone treatment outcomes in nonintubated patients with severe COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study included patients with severe COVID-19 admitted to an academic referral center in Stony Brook, New York, from March 1 to April 15, 2020, receiving high-flow oxygen therapy (fraction of inspired oxygen, ≥50%). The outcomes of treatment with methylprednisolone were estimated using inverse probability of treatment weights, based on a propensity score comprised of clinical and laboratory variables. Patients were followed up for 28 days. Data were analyzed from December 19, 2020, to July 22, 2021. Exposures: Systemic methylprednisolone administered per the discretion of the treating physician. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was mortality, and the secondary outcome was a composite of death or mechanical ventilation at 28 days. Results: Among 380 patients with available ferritin data (median [IQR] age, 60 years [49-72] years; 130 [34.2%] women; 250 [65.8%] men; 310 White patients [81.6%]; 47 Black patients [12.4%]; 23 Asian patients [6.1%]), 142 patients (37.4%) received methylprednisolone (median [IQR] daily dose, 160 [120-240] mg).

672486,The other crisis,2020-05-16,"The heart releases natriuretic peptides (NPs) which represent an important hormonal axis with cardiorenal protective effects. In view of their properties, NPs have pathophysiologic, diagnostic and prognostic implications in several cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Severe pulmonary inflammation, as induced by the SARS-COV2, may increase pulmonary pressure with potential influence on NPs release, whereby normal cardiovascular integrity becomes impaired. Moreover, pre-existing CVDs are strong negative prognostic factors since they exacerbate the effects of the viral infection and lead to worse outcomes. In this context, it may be expected that NPs exert a key protective role toward the virus infection whereas an impairment of NPs release contributes to the virus deleterious effects. In this review article we explore the potential involvement of NPs in the COVID-19 disease. To this aim, we will first focus on the interactions between NPs and the Ang II/ATIR arm of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) as well as with the protective ACE2/Ang (1-7) arm of the RAAS. Subsequently, we will review evidence that strongly supports the role of increased NT-proBNP level as a marker of cardiac damage and of worse prognosis in the COVID-19 affected patients. Finally, we will discuss the potential therapeutic benefits of these protective hormones toward the viral infection through their endothelial protective function, anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic effects.

The ACE2 sequence is similar (sequence identities 43% and 35%, and similarities 61% and 55%, respectively) to those of the testis-specific form of ACE (tACE) and the Drosophila homolog of ACE (AnCE). The high level of sequence similarity allowed us to build a robust homology model of the ACE2 structure with a root-mean-square deviation from the aligned crystal structures of tACE and AnCE less than 0.5 Å. A prominent feature of the model is a deep channel on the top of the molecule that contains the catalytic site. Negatively charged ridges surrounding the channel may provide a possible binding site for the positively charged receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S-glycoprotein, which we recently identified [Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 312 (2003) 1159]. Several distinct patches of hydrophobic residues at the ACE2 surface were noted at close proximity to the charged ridges that could contribute to binding.

METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of 16,416 people covering three risk groups was conducted between 3–16 September 2020 using the state of Karnataka’s infrastructure of 290 healthcare facilities across all 30 districts. Participants were further classified into risk subgroups and sampled using stratified sampling. All participants were subjected to simultaneous detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgG using a commercial ELISA kit, SARS-CoV-2 antigen using a rapid antigen detection test (RAT) and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for RNA detection. Maximum-likelihood estimation was used for joint estimation of the adjusted IgG, active and total prevalence (either IgG or active or both), while multinomial regression identified predictors. RESULTS: The overall adjusted total prevalence of COVID-19 in Karnataka was 27.7% (95% CI 26.1–29.3), IgG 16.8% (15.5–18.1) and active infection fraction 12.6% (11.5–13.8). The case-to-infection ratio was 1:40 and the infection fatality rate was 0.05%. Influenza-like symptoms or contact with a COVID-19-positive patient were good predictors of active infection. RAT kits had higher sensitivity (68%) in symptomatic people compared with 47% in asymptomatic people. CONCLUSION: This sentinel-based population survey was the first comprehensive survey in India to provide accurate estimates of the COVID-19 burden. The findings provide a reasonable approximation of the population immunity threshold levels. Using existing surveillance platforms coupled with a syndromic approach and sampling framework enabled this model to be replicable.","Babu, Giridhara R.; Sundaresan, Rajesh; Athreya, Siva; Akhtar, Jawaid; Pandey, Pankaj Kumar; Maroor, Parimala S.; Padma, M.

The performance of the multiplex assay, compared to the single assay was assessed for the standard calibration curve, required for absolute quantification, and then, for the real environmental samples to detect SARS-CoV-2. For this latter, four environmental samples were collected at a local wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). The results showed that the cycle threshold (Ct) values of the multiplex were comparable to the values obtained by the singleplex PCR. The amplification of the three target genes indicated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the four water samples with an increasing trend in February and these results were confirmed in the multiplex approach, showing the robustness of this method and its applicability for the relative abundance analysis among the samples. Overall, both the laboratory and field work results demonstrated that the multiplex PCR assay developed in this study could provide a method for SARS-CoV-2 detection as robust as the single qPCR, but faster and cost-effective, reducing by three times the number of reactions, and consequently the handling time and reagents.","Navarro, Anna; Gómez, Livia; Sanseverino, Isabella; Niegowska, Magdalena; Roka, Eszter; Pedraccini, Rosalba; Vargha, Marta; Lettieri, Teresa",Sci Total Environ,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.148890; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34298359/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969721039620; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969721039620?v=s5,475

Notably, similar complications are being observed during severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. We conducted a prospective, single-center, observational study in a tertiary university hospital (CUB-Hôpital Erasme, Brussels) to address the zinc status, the association between the plasma zinc concentration, development of CRS, and the clinical outcomes in PCR-confirmed and hospitalized COVID-19 patients. One hundred and thirty-nine eligible patients were included between May 2020 and November 2020 (median age of 65 years [IQR = 54, 77]). Our cohort's median plasma zinc concentration was 57 µg/dL (interquartile range [IQR] = 45, 67) compared to 74 µg/dL (IQR = 64, 84) in the retrospective non-COVID-19 control group (N = 1513; p < 0.001). Markedly, the absolute majority of COVID-19 patients (96%) were zinc deficient (<80 µg/dL). The median zinc concentration was lower in patients with CRS compared to those without CRS (-5 µg/dL; 95% CI = -10.5, 0.051; p = 0.048). Among the tested outcomes, zinc concentration is significantly correlated with only the length of hospital stay (rho = -0.19; p = 0.022), but not with mortality or morbidity. As such, our findings do not support the role of zinc as a robust prognostic marker among hospitalized COVID-19 patients who in our cohort presented a high prevalence of zinc deficiency. It might be more beneficial to explore the role of zinc as a biomarker for assessing the risk of developing a tissue-damaging CRS and predicting outcomes in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 at the early stage of the disease.","Verschelden, Gil; Noeparast, Maxim; Noparast, Maryam; Goossens, Mathijs Christiaan; Lauwers, Maïlis; Cotton, Frédéric; Michel, Charlotte; Goyvaerts, Cleo; Hites, Maya",Int Immunopharmacol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34583122/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567576921007992?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intimp.2021.108163; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567576921007992,475

It has been sufficiently shown that sex differences have a critical influence on the shaping of immune response, which then leads to different pathogenesis in infectious diseases.

From a single city, it spread to 188 countries across the world and infected 30 million people by September 18, 2020. Decades of modeling pandemics predicted potential consequences, but COVID-19's impact on the food supply chain, and specifically livestock production was unexpected. Clusters of cases among workers in meat processing plants evolved quickly to affect human, animal, and environmental welfare in several countries. In processing plants, the hygiene focus is on product quality and food safety. Because of their close proximity to one another, COVID-19 spread rapidly between workers and the lack of sick leave and health insurance likely resulted in workers continuing to work when infectious. In the United States (U.S.) many processing plants shut down when they identified major outbreaks, putting pressure especially on pig and poultry industries. At one point, there was a 45% reduction in pig processing capacity meaning about 250,000 pigs per day were not slaughtered. This resulted in longer transport distances to plants in operation with extra capacity, but also to crowding of animals on farm. Producers were encouraged to slow growth rates, but some had to cull animals on farm in ways that likely included suffering and caused considerable upset to owners and workers. Carcass disposal was also associated with potential biosecurity risks and detrimental effects on the environment. Hence, this is a One Welfare issue, affecting human, animal, and environmental welfare and highlighting the fragility of intensive, high-throughput livestock production systems. This model needs to be re-shaped to include the animal, human, and environmental elements across the farm to fork chain. Such a One Welfare approach will ensure that food production systems are resilient, flexible, and fair in the face of future challenges.","Marchant-Forde, Jeremy N.; Boyle, Laura A.",Front Vet Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33195613/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fvets.2020.585787,475
680491,Identifying individuals with recent COVID-19 through voice classification using deep learning,2021-09-27,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Critical care registries are synonymous with measurement of outcomes following critical illness. Their ability to provide longitudinal data to enable benchmarking of outcomes for comparison within units over time, and between units, both regionally and nationally is a key part of the evaluation of quality of care and ICU performance as well as a better understanding of case-mix. This review aims to summarise literature on outcome measures currently being reported in registries internationally, describe the current strengths and challenges with interpreting existing outcomes and highlight areas where registries may help improve implementation and interpretation of both existing and new outcome measures. RECENT FINDINGS: Outcomes being widely reported through ICU registries include measures of survival, events of interest, patient reported outcomes and measures of resource utilisation (including cost). Despite its increasing adoption, challenges with quality of reporting of outcomes measures remain. Measures of short-term survival are feasible, but those requiring longer follow-ups are increasingly difficult to interpret given the evolving nature of critical care in the context of acute and chronic disease management. Furthermore, heterogeneity in patient populations and in healthcare organisations in different settings makes use of outcome measures for international benchmarking at best complex, requiring substantial advances in their definitions and implementation to support those seeking to improve patient care. SUMMARY: Digital registries could help overcome some of the current challenges with implementing and interpreting ICU outcome data through standardisation of reporting and harmonisation of data. In addition, ICU registries could be instrumental in enabling data for feedback as part of improvement in both patient centred outcomes and in service outcomes; notably resource utilisation and efficiency.","Beane, Abi; Salluh, Jorge I.F.; Haniffa, Rashan",Curr Opin Crit Care,https://doi.org/10.1097/mcc.0000000000000865; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34393177/,475

RESULTS: We discuss that comprehensive strategies must face multifactorial consequences since the pandemic becomes syndemic due to interactions with noncommunicable diseases, climate changes and iniquities. The lockdown experience, on the other hand, demonstrates that it is rapidly possible to reverse epidemiologic trends and to reduce pollution. The worst outcome is evident in eight highly industrialized nations, where 12% of the world population experienced about one-third of all COVID-19-deaths worldwide. Thus, a great economic power has not been fully protective, and a change of policy is obviously needed to avoid irreversible consequences. CONCLUSIONS: We are accumulating unhealthy populations living in unhealthy environments and generating unhealthy offspring. The winning policy should tackle structural inequities through a syndemic approach, to protect vulnerable populations from present and future harms.","Di Ciaula, Agostino; Krawczyk, Marcin; Filipiak, Krzysztof J; Geier, Andreas; Bonfrate, Leonilde; Portincasa, Piero",Eur J Clin Invest,https://doi.org/10.1111/eci.13682; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34551123/,475

In particular, the increasing generation of plastic waste at home may pose a problem for these groups, as this type of waste accumulates very rapidly and occupies a considerable amount of space. This paper proposes a collaborative infrastructure to monitor household plastic waste. It consists of simple smart bins using a weight scale and a smart application that forecasts the amount of plastic generated for each bin at different time horizons out of the data provided by the smart bins. The application generates optimal routes for the waste-pickers collaborating in the system through a route-planning algorithm. This algorithm takes into account the predicted amount of plastic of each bin and the waste-picker’s location and means of transport. This proposal has been evaluated by means of a simulated scenario in Quezon City, Philippines, where severe problems with plastic waste have been identified. A set of 176 experiments have been performed to collect data that allow representing different user behaviors when generating plastic waste. The results show that our proposal enables waste-pickers to collect more than the 80% of the household plastic-waste bins before they are completely full.","Sidhu, Navjot; Pons-Buttazzo, Alberto; Muñoz, Andrés; Terroso-Saenz, Fernando",Sensors (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/s21134534; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34282802/,475

In Brazil, about 35 million Brazilians still do not have treated water and more than 100 million do not have basic sanitation. These people, already exposed to a range of diseases, are among the most vulnerable to COVID-19. According to studies, places that have poor sanitation allow the proliferation of the coronavirus, been observed a greater number of infected people being found in these regions. This social problem is strongly related to the lack of effective management of water resources, since they are the sources for the population's water supply and the recipients of effluents stemming from sanitation services (household effluents, urban drainage and solid waste). In this context, studies are needed to develop technologies and methodologies to improve the management of water resources. The application of tools such as artificial intelligence and hydrometeorological models are emerging as a promising alternative to meet the world's needs in water resources planning, assessment of environmental impacts on a region's hydrology, risk prediction and mitigation. The main model of this type, WRF-Hydro Weather Research and Forecasting Model), represents the state of the art regarding water resources, as well as being the object of study of small and medium-sized river basins that tend to have less water availability. hydrometeorological data and analysis.

This research are in development and represents a preliminary results with future perspectives.","Dantas da Silva Júnior, José Roberto; Pedruzzi, Rizzieri; de Souza, Filipe Milani; Ferraz, Patrick Silva; Silva, Daniel Guimarães; Vieira, Carolina Sacramento; de Moraes, Marcelo Romero; Nascimento, Erick Giovani Sperandio; Moreira, Davidson Martins",AI Perspect,https://doi.org/10.1186/s42467-021-00011-0,475
682686,Beurteilung des neuen Masernschutzgesetzes in Deutschland: Ergebnisse einer deutschlandweiten Befragung,2020-11-20,"In an effort to effectively control coal dust pollution and thereby reduce the harm of coal dust to human health, we prepared a highly efficient composite dust suppressant. First, dynamic contact angle and zeta potential measurements were used to select sodium dodecyl sulfonate (SDS) over sodium carboxymethyl cellulose and trisodium methyl silicon as the complementary additive to soy protein isolate for the dust suppressant. We employed viscosity and wind erosion resistance tests to compare the performance of the composite dust suppressant with three common, commercially available suppressants. As the concentration of the composite dust suppressant was increased, the viscosity increased, reaching a maximum value of 22.7 mPa·s at a concentration of 5 wt%. The 5 wt% concentration of the composite dust suppressant provided the lowest wind erosion rate (20.62%) at a wind speed of 12 m/s. The composite dust suppressant also had good bonding performance and wind erosion resistance. Scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and thermogravimetric analysis were used to characterize the properties of the dust suppressants. The dust suppressant, which had a crystal-like structure, could easily capture coal dust and form an effective package. In addition, the density of the dust suppressant film increased as its crystallinity increased. The increased density was beneficial in that it enabled the dust suppressant to form a hard, solidified shell on the surface of coal dust, which improved dust suppression. The composite dust suppressant also had good thermal stability.","Jin, Hu; Zhang, Yansong; Chen, Kun; Niu, Kuo; Wu, Guangan; Wei, Xiangrui; Wang, Houwang",Polymers (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33317125/; https://doi.org/10.3390/polym12122942,475
682934,International beachtet: Das Heidelberger Corona-Taxi,2020-07-21,"A number of RT-qPCR assays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 have been published and are listed by the WHO as recommended assays. Furthermore, numerous commercial assays with undisclosed primer and probe sequences are on the market. As the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic progresses, the virus accrues mutations, which in some cases – as seen with the B.1.1.7 variant – can outperform and push back other strains of SARS-CoV-2. If mutations occur in primer or probe binding sites, this can impact RT-qPCR results and impede SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics. Here we tested the effect of primer mismatches on RT-qPCR performance in vitro using synthetic mismatch in vitro transcripts. The effects of the mismatches ranged from a shift in ct values from −0.13 to +7.61. Crucially, we found that a mismatch in the forward primer has a more detrimental effect for PCR performance than a mismatch in the reverse primer. Furthermore, we compared the performance of the original Charité RdRP primer set, which has several ambiguities, with a primer version without ambiguities and found that without ambiguities the ct values are ca. 3 ct lower. Finally, we investigated the shift in ct values observed with the Seegene Allplex kit with the B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 variant and found a three-nucleotide mismatch in the forward primer of the N target.","Zimmermann, Fee; Urban, Maria; Krüger, Christian; Walter, Mathias; Wölfel, Roman; Zwirglmaier, Katrin",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.07.447338,475
683800,Enabling new mindsets and transformative skills for negotiating and activating climate action: Lessons from UNFCCC conferences of the parties,2020-07-01,"The study’s objective is to examine the relationship between COVID-19 cases, environmental sustainability ratings, and mineral resource rents in a large cross section of 97 countries. The emergence of novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) enlarges its magnitude across the international borders and damages social, economic, and environmental infrastructure with a high rate of human death tolls. The mineral resources are also devastated, which served as a primary raw input into the production system. The adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the environment and mineral resources are studied in a large panel of countries and found that mineral resource rents and population growth improve environmental sustainability rating (ESR). In contrast, an increase in coronavirus cases decreases the rating scale across countries. Further, mineral resources first decrease along with increased COVID-19 cases due to strict government policies, including the mandatory shutdown of economic institutions. Further, mineral resource rents increase later because of resuming economic activities in many parts of the world. The high rate of population growth is another important factor that negatively affects mineral resources across countries. Through impulse response and variance decomposition estimates, an exacerbated coronavirus cases and population growth would likely negatively affect ESR and mineral resources. In contrast, COVID-19 recovered cases will likely play a more significant role in securing mineral resources over time. Therefore, the global mineral resource conservation policies and improving ESR are highly needed during the COVID-19 to keep the significant economic gains in unprecedented times.","Anser, Muhammad Khalid; Nassani, Abdelmohsen A.; Zaman, Khalid; Abro, Muhammad Moinuddin Qazi",Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-16259-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34519987/,475

688463,Virus detection using nanosensors,2020-02-14,"Zimbabwe is among the countries affected with the coronavirus disease (COVID‐19) and implemented several infection control and measures such as social distancing, contact tracing, regular temperature checking in strategic entry and exit points, face masking among others. The country also implemented recursive national lockdowns and curfews to reduce the virus transmission rate and its catastrophic impact. These large‐scale measures are not easy to implement, adhere to and subsequently difficult to practice and maintain which lead to imperfect public compliance, especially if there is a significant impact on social and political norms, economy, and psychological wellbeing of the affected population. Also, emerging COVID‐19 variants, porous borders, regular movement of informal traders and sale of fake vaccination certificates continue to threaten impressive progress made towards virus containment. Therefore, several emerging technologies have been adopted to strengthen the health system and health services delivery, improve compliance, adherence and maintain social distancing. These technologies use health data, symptoms monitoring, mobility, location and proximity data for contact tracing, self‐isolation, and quarantine compliance. However, the use of emerging technologies has been debatable and contentious because of the potential violation of ethical values such as security and privacy, data format and management, synchronization, over‐tracking, over‐surveillance and lack of proper development and implementation guidelines which impact their efficacy, adoption and ultimately influence public trust. Therefore, the study proposes ethical framework for using emerging technologies to contain the COVID‐19 pandemic. The framework is centered on ethical practices such as security, privacy, justice, human dignity, autonomy, solidarity, beneficence, and non‐maleficence.","Mbunge, Elliot; Fashoto, Stephen G.; Akinnuwesi, Boluwaji; Metfula, Andile; Simelane, Sakhile; Ndumiso, Nzuza",Hum Behav Emerg Technol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34518816/; https://doi.org/10.1002/hbe2.277,475

689669,"A TRANSPARENT, OPEN-SOURCE SIRD MODEL FOR COVID19DEATH PROJECTIONS IN INDIA",2020-06-04,"The need to forecast COVID-19 related variables continues to be pressing as the epidemic unfolds. Different efforts have been made, with compartmental models in epidemiology and statistical models such as AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Exponential Smoothing (ETS) or computing intelligence models. These efforts have proved useful in some instances by allowing decision makers to distinguish different scenarios during the emergency, but their accuracy has been disappointing, forecasts ignore uncertainties and less attention is given to local areas. In this study, we propose a simple Multiple Linear Regression model, optimised to use phone call data to forecast the number of daily confirmed cases. Moreover, we produce a probabilistic forecast that allows decision makers to better deal with risk. Our proposed approach outperforms ARIMA, ETS, Seasonal Naive, Prophet and a regression model without call data, evaluated by three point forecast error metrics, one prediction interval and two probabilistic forecast accuracy measures. The simplicity, interpretability and reliability of the model, obtained in a careful forecasting exercise, is a meaningful contribution to decision makers at local level who acutely need to organise resources in already strained health services. We hope that this model would serve as a building block of other forecasting efforts that on the one hand would help front-line personal and decision makers at local level, and on the other would facilitate the communication with other modelling efforts being made at the national level to improve the way we tackle this pandemic and other similar future challenges.","Rostami-Tabar, Bahman; Rendon-Sanchez, Juan F.",Appl Soft Comput,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S156849462030870X?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S156849462030870X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.asoc.2020.106932; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33269029/,475
