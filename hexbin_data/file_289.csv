1354,1354,1354,A SYBR Green I based real time RT-PCR assay for specific detection and quantitation of Peste des petits ruminants virus,10.090733,8.414053,2014-01-14,"BACKGROUND: Peste des petits ruminants (PPR) is an economically important disease of small ruminants such as sheep and goats. The disease is characterized by severe pyrexia, oculo-nasal discharge, pneumonia, necrosis and ulceration of the mucous membrane and inflammation of the gastro-intestinal tract leading to severe diarrhea. A SYBR Green I based real time RT-PCR targeting the N gene of PPRV has not been established for PPRV detection. Thus, the objective of present study was to develop highly sensitive N gene target SYBR Green I real time RT-PCR for specific detection and quantification of PPRV in clinical samples. A set of primers was designed to detect the nucleocapsid (N) gene of PPRV. RESULTS: The assay exhibited high specificity as all the viruses which have clinical and structural similarities to PPRV including Canine distemper virus (CDV), Measles virus (MV), Bluetongue virus (BTV) and Newcastle disease virus (NDV) failed to show an amplification signal. The lower detection limit of the assay was 5.11 copies/μl (Ct value of 33.67 ± 0.5) and 0.001 TCID(50)/ml (Ct value of 34.7 ± 0.5) based on plasmid copy number and tissue culture infectivity titre. The assay was 3-log more sensitive than the conventional RT-PCR. The coefficient of variation (CV) values for intra- and inter-assay variability were low, ranging from 0.32% - 2.31%, and 0.71% - 5.32%, respectively. To evaluate the performance of the newly developed assay, a total of 36 clinical samples suspected of PPR were screened for the presence of PPRV in parallel with conventional RT-PCR. The real time RT-PCR assay detected PPRV in 30 (83.3%) of clinical samples compared to 16 (44.4%) by conventional RT-PCR. CONCLUSIONS: The two-step SYBR Green I based real time RT-PCR assay reported here is highly sensitive, specific, reproducible and rapid for detection and quantification of PPRV nucleic acids.","Abera, Tsegalem; Thangavelu, Ardhanary; Joy Chandran, Navamani Daniel; Raja, Angamuthu",BMC Vet Res,289,28
1863,1863,1863,Recombinase Polymerase Amplification Assay for Rapid Diagnostics of Dengue Infection,10.026216,8.568056,2015-06-15,"BACKGROUND: Over 2.5 billion people are exposed to the risk of contracting dengue fever (DF). Early diagnosis of DF helps to diminish its burden on public health. Real-time reverse transcription polymerase amplification assays (RT-PCR) are the standard method for molecular detection of the dengue virus (DENV). Real-time RT-PCR analysis is not suitable for on-site screening since mobile devices are large, expensive, and complex. In this study, two RT-recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA) assays were developed to detect DENV1-4. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using two quantitative RNA molecular standards, the analytical sensitivity of a RT-RPA targeting the 3´non-translated region of DENV1-4 was found to range from 14 (DENV4) to 241 (DENV1-3) RNA molecules detected. The assay was specific and did not cross detect other Flaviviruses. The RT-RPA assay was tested in a mobile laboratory combining magnetic-bead based total nucleic acid extraction and a portable detection device in Kedougou (Senegal) and in Bangkok (Thailand). In Kedougou, the RT-RPA was operated at an ambient temperature of 38°C with auxiliary electricity tapped from a motor vehicle and yielded a clinical sensitivity and specificity of 98% (n=31) and 100% (n=23), respectively. While in the field trial in Bangkok, the clinical sensitivity and specificity were 72% (n=90) and 100%(n=41), respectively. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: During the first 5 days of infection, the developed DENV1-4 RT-RPA assays constitute a suitable accurate and rapid assay for DENV diagnosis. Moreover, the use of a portable fluorescence-reading device broadens its application potential to the point-of-care for outbreak investigations.","Abd El Wahed, Ahmed; Patel, Pranav; Faye, Oumar; Thaloengsok, Sasikanya; Heidenreich, Doris; Matangkasombut, Ponpan; Manopwisedjaroen, Khajohnpong; Sakuntabhai, Anavaj; Sall, Amadou A.; Hufert, Frank T.; Weidmann, Manfred",PLoS One,289,1

Following viral internalization into endosomes, GP is cleaved by host cysteine proteases to expose a receptor-binding site (RBS) that is otherwise hidden from immune surveillance. Here, we present the crystal structure of proteolytically cleaved Ebola virus GP to a resolution of 3.3 Å. We use this structure in conjunction with functional analysis of a large panel of pseudotyped viruses bearing mutant GP proteins to map the Ebola virus GP endosomal RBS at molecular resolution. Our studies indicate that binding of GP to its endosomal receptor Niemann-Pick C1 occurs in two distinct stages: the initial electrostatic interactions are followed by specific interactions with a hydrophobic trough that is exposed on the endosomally cleaved GP(1) subunit. Finally, we demonstrate that monoclonal antibodies targeting the filovirus RBS neutralize all known filovirus GPs, making this conserved pocket a promising target for the development of panfilovirus therapeutics.","Bornholdt, Zachary A.; Ndungo, Esther; Fusco, Marnie L.; Bale, Shridhar; Flyak, Andrew I.; Crowe, James E.; Chandran, Kartik; Saphire, Erica Ollmann",mBio,289,28
2856,2856,2856,Model of the pathway of −1 frameshifting: Long pausing,9.74392,8.415154,2016-01-29,"It has been characterized that the programmed ribosomal −1 frameshifting often occurs at the slippery sequence on the presence of a downstream mRNA pseudoknot. In some prokaryotic cases such as the dnaX gene of Escherichia coli, an additional stimulatory signal—an upstream, internal Shine–Dalgarno (SD) sequence—is also necessary to stimulate the efficient −1 frameshifting. However, the molecular and physical mechanism of the −1 frameshifting is poorly understood. Here, we propose a model of the pathway of the −1 translational frameshifting during ribosome translation of the dnaX −1 frameshift mRNA. With the model, the single-molecule fluorescence data (Chen et al. (2014) [29]) on the dynamics of the shunt either to long pausing or to normal translation, the tRNA transit and sampling dynamics in the long-paused rotated state, the EF-G sampling dynamics, the mean rotated-state lifetimes, etc., are explained quantitatively. Moreover, the model is also consistent with the experimental data (Yan et al. (2015) [30]) on translocation excursions and broad branching of frameshifting pathways. In addition, we present some predicted results, which can be easily tested by future optical trapping experiments.","Xie, Ping",Biochem Biophys Rep,289,1

Compounds discontinued from clinical development since 2016 and new antibacterial pharmacophores are also reviewed. There has been an increase in the number of early stage clinical candidates, which has been fueled by antibiotic-focused funding agencies; however, there is still a significant gap in the pipeline for the development of new antibacterials with activity against β-metallolactamases, orally administered with broad spectrum G−ve activity, and new treatments for MDR Acinetobacter and gonorrhea.","Butler, Mark S.; Paterson, David L.",J Antibiot (Tokyo),289,1

It has gained increasing attention due to its negative correlation with Staphylococcus aureus, which is one of the most successful modern pathogens causing severe infections with tremendous morbidity and mortality due to its multiple resistances. As the possible mechanisms behind its inhibition of S. aureus remain unclear, a genome-scale metabolic model (GEM) is of enormous interest and high importance to better study its role in this fight. This article presents the first GEM of D. pigrum, which was curated using automated reconstruction tools and extensive manual curation steps to yield a high-quality GEM. It was evaluated and validated using all currently available experimental data of D. pigrum. With this model, already predicted auxotrophies and biosynthetic pathways could be verified. The model was used to define a minimal medium for further laboratory experiments and to predict various carbon sources’ growth capacities. This model will pave the way to better understand D. pigrum’s role in the fight against S. aureus.","Renz, Alina; Widerspick, Lina; Dräger, Andreas",Metabolites,289,28

To date, a comprehensive review of jockeys’ mental health has yet to be conducted. OBJECTIVES: To examine the existing literature related to jockeys’ mental health, including the prevalence of symptoms associated with mental health difficulties and help-seeking. DESIGN: A narrative review of the literature was conducted with articles screened from inception until January 2021. RESULTS: Sixteen studies were included in the narrative review. Studies covered a range of mental health difficulties which included mood (depression), anxiety, distress, disordered eating and substance misuse. Rates of help-seeking among jockeys were also explored. Results indicated that jockeys reported higher levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms compared with other elite athletes. Substance misuse, in particular adverse alcohol use, also appears greater among jockeys than other elite athletes. Distress symptoms appear comparable with other elite athletes. Risk factors for mental health difficulties included injury, perceived stress, athlete burnout, career dissatisfaction and the contemplation of retirement. Weight-making negatively impacts jockeys’ mood and attitudes towards eating, with lower competitive riding weights associated with more disordered eating attitudes. Moreover, help-seeking from mental health professionals appears low. CONCLUSION: The review identifies a high prevalence of symptoms of mental health difficulties among professional jockeys. Applied recommendations and future research considerations are proposed throughout the review article.","King, Lewis; Cullen, Sarah Jane; McGoldrick, Adrian; Pugh, Jennifer; Warrington, Giles; Woods, Gary; Losty, Ciara",BMJ Open Sport Exerc Med,289,11

The HCV outbreak was not detected, while that of HIV was identified in 2011. The integrated HIV-interventions, launched in early 2012, managed to reduce directly the HIV incidence and indirectly the HCV incidence. This study aims to assess what would have been the course of the HIV outbreak and its associated economic consequences if the 2009 HCV outbreak had been detected and integrated interventions had been initiated 1- or 2-years earlier. METHODS: The model was calibrated to reproduce the observed HIV epidemiological and clinical parameters among PWID of Athens, Greece. We examined the effect of the 1- or 2-years earlier detection scenarios, the 1-year later detection, the non-detection scenario, and compared them to the status quo scenario. RESULTS: Cumulative HIV cases, under the status-quo scenario during 2009‐2019, were 1360 (90% Credible intervals: 290, 2470). If the HCV outbreak had been detected 1- or 2- years earlier, with immediate initiation of integrated interventions, 740 and 1110 HIV cases could be averted by 2019, respectively. Regarding the costs, if there was an efficient notification system to detect the HCV outbreak 1 or 2 years earlier, 35.2–53.2 million euros could be saved compared to the status quo by 2019. CONCLUSIONS: If the HCV outbreak had been detected and promptly addressed, the HIV outbreak would have been prevented and 35.2–53.2 million euros could have been saved.","Gountas, Ilias; Nikolopoulos, Georgios; Touloumi, Giota; Fotiou, Anastasios; Souliotis, Kyriakos",PLoS One,289,33

Our paper expands theory within this literature in two new directions. First, we look at the controlling image of the “illegal” as well as the conventional controlling images of the immigrant described in the literature. Second, we investigate whether controlling images of Latinx immigrants remain prevalent outside of newspapers aimed at a predominantly White audience by comparing controlling images of immigrants in Atlanta’s mainstream press to the city’s Black press. We find that controlling images of immigrants are prevalent in the mainstream press but seldom appear in the Black news media. We also find that the “illegal” represents the predominant controlling image of immigrants in both. Few controlling images are explicitly gendered. We argue that the lack of gendering in the controlling images of immigrants may serve to dehumanize all immigrants, complicating and expanding extant research.","Delia Deckard, Natalie; Browne, Irene; Rodriguez, Cassaundra; Martinez-Cola, Marisela; Gonzalez Leal, Sofia",Lat Stud,289,16

The purpose of this study is to compile all the available literature and published guideline to facilitate the patient management. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PubMed, Scopus, and Google scholar database were systematically searched using the search terms “COVID-19” AND “pediatric” AND “urology”. All published papers retrieved from this search were considered for this review based on PRISMA guidelines. In addition to this, World Wide Web search was conducted for guidelines, and recommendations published by scientific societies and their websites were searched for the desired information. RESULTS: Total eight articles and society recommendations met the inclusion criteria and included in the study. The general level of agreement was found on need to postpone the elective cases and ensuring the safety of hospital staff. The organ and life-threatening conditions like acute and symptomatic obstructive uropathy and testicular torsion should be treated on an emergent basis irrespective of COVID status. There is no evidence that any modality either open or laparoscopic has any advantage over the other. The protocols need to be modified based on stage of pandemic, availability of resources, and local guidelines. The restart of work once the pandemic is over should also be prioritised.

The objective of this study is to examine the current status of the heavy mineral industry of Sri Lanka. The present study also examines the economic viability of potential heavy mineral placer deposits, based on geochemical data. Field investigations suggested the occurrence of heavy minerals as beach-placers, and inland/raised beach deposits along the coastline of Sri Lanka. Geochemical results showed the enrichment of TiO(2), Fe(2)O(3), Al(2)O(3), and trace elements, and depletion of other major oxides such as Na(2)O, K(2)O, MnO, MgO, CaO, and P(2)O(5). Consequently, it suggests the abundance of ilmenite, leucoxene, rutile, sillimanite, garnet, and rare earth element (REE)-bearing heavy minerals in potential placer deposits. In contrast, this study illustrates the exported quantity (in the weight ratio of 35:3:1) of ilmenite, rutile, and zircon minerals during the last decade. Ilmenite is the dominant heavy mineral in Sri Lanka, and thus, its production and price volatilisations are essential to understand the current status and predict the future behaviour of the heavy mineral industry. Statistical observations suggest that the global production and unit price variations of ilmenite have increased gradually from 1950 to 2015. Besides, the forecasted variations in annual global production and unit price changes of ilmenite indicate healthy compound annual growth rates of 1.27% and 1.43%, respectively. However, Sri Lanka has less contribution (< 1%) to global ilmenite production. Consequently, the value addition of ilmenite must be highly encouraged with at least an immediate stage (e.g. synthetic rutile). The present study also highlights possible value addition stages of available heavy mineral resources (low-, intermediate-, or high-level value addition), and discusses action plans to improve the quality of the heavy mineral industry of Sri Lanka. In recommendations, imposing sustainable regulations and policies would uplift the heavy mineral industry of Sri Lanka. For example, value addition to local heavy minerals and terminating raw commodity export are highly recommended.","Subasinghe, H. C. S.; Ratnayake, Amila Sandaruwan; Sameera, K. A.

Identifying the precise origin will help in determining the optimal surgical approach. We retrospectively analyzed the preoperative vestibular function test according to VS origin to determine whether the test is a valuable indicator of tumor origin. Forty-seven patients with VS (male:female = 18:29, mean age: 54.06 ± 13.50 years) underwent the cochleovestibular function test (pure-tone audiometry, caloric test, video head impulse test (vHIT), cervical and ocular vestibular-evoked myogenic potential, and posturography). All patients then underwent surgical removal of VS, and the schwannoma origin was confirmed. The tumor originated from the superior vestibular nerve (SVN group) in 21 patients, the inferior vestibular nerve (IVN group) in 26 patients, and an undetermined site in eight patients. The only value that differed significantly among the groups was the gain of the vestibular-ocular reflex (VOR) in the ipsilesional posterior canal (iPC) during the vHIT. Our results indicate that VOR gain in the iPC may be used to predict the nerve origin in patients with VS. Other cochleovestibular function tests have limited value to discriminate nerve origins, especially in cases of medium to large VS.","Nam, Gi-Sung; Bae, Seong-Hoon; Kim, Hye-Jeen; Cho, Ji-Woong; Moon, In-Seok",J Clin Med,289,20

Oral care research and knowledge about prerequisites and obstacles is extensive. However, there is a lack of knowledge about how nursing staff in short-term care units describe their satisfaction about provided oral care in order to maintain older people's oral health. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to describe how nursing staff perceive their satisfaction of oral care provided for older people in short-term care units and to identify oral care improvements. METHODS: This study reports on the results of two open-ended questions that were part of a larger study. Informants (n = 54) were nursing staff working in the involved short-term care units in municipalities from both densely and sparsely populated regions in central and northern Sweden. The answers to the open-ended questions were analyzed using content analysis. RESULTS: The analysis yielded one main category; “Working together to improve satisfaction with older people's oral care” and four subcategories: “Older people's oral health,” “Consideration and respect for the older person's autonomy,” “Having access to adequate products,” and “Working together in the same direction.” CONCLUSION: Identification of older people's oral health problems together with adequate nursing intervention will increase older people's health outcomes and quality of life. However, regardless of work role, the nursing staff might have difficulty changing their behavior or transforming intentions into actions. Oral care is a complicated and proactive practice that requires nursing staff's attention as well as both educational and organizational initiatives. Working in a supportive and collaborative relationship provides prerequisites for optimal oral care in short-term care units.","Andersson, Maria; Persenius, Mona",SAGE Open Nurs,289,1

However, ruptured aneurysms are underrepresented in existing studies. This retrospective multicenter study describes the use of the WEB in patients with a ruptured intracranial aneurysm. MATERIALS AND METHODS Ten centers contributed to this study. Clinical and procedural data of 47 patients with 52 aneurysms were analyzed retrospectively together with follow-up angiographies. RESULTS There were 37 anterior and 15 posterior circulation aneurysms with a neck size of ≥4 mm in 49 of 52 (94%) aneurysms; 45 (87%) aneurysms were <10 mm, and 2 were partially thrombosed. Successful placement of the WEB was possible in every case. Adjunctive devices were used in 8 of 52 (15%) aneurysms. Thromboembolic events were observed in 4 of 52 (8%) patients. Adverse events occurred in 15 patients with 16 aneurysms, 9 of which were potentially related to the WEB procedure (3 thromboembolic events, 5 protrusions, and 1 perforations; 2 perforations were caused by the wire or catheter), but none had a clinical impact. Four patients were retreated. Short-term follow-up in 25 of 39 patients revealed complete occlusion in 15 of 25 (60%), 5 of 25 (20%) with residual neck, and 5 of 25 (20%) with residual aneurysm filling. Short- to midterm imaging in 9 of 25 patients revealed complete occlusion in 5 (55.6%), residual neck in 2 (22%), and residual aneurysm filling in 2 (22%).

The primary outcome was the representation quotient, the ratio of the proportion of a racial/ethnic group in the guideline studies relative to the estimated proportion of that group in the U.S. POPULATION Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and Pearson χ test. RESULTS There were 387 studies included, 35% of which reported participants' race. Of the studies that included U.S. participants, 111 (61%) reported race and 44 (24%) reported Hispanic ethnicity. The representation quotient for White and Asian participants was 1.06 and 1.62, indicating overrepresentation relative to the U.S. population, respectively. The representation quotient for Black, Hispanic, and American Indian/Alaska Native participants was 0.85, 0.56, and 0.02, respectively, indicating underrepresentation for these groups. Evaluation of the representation quotients over time revealed no meaningful change in representation from 1990 to 2019 for any racial/ethnic group. CONCLUSIONS The evidence based on the overactive bladder guidelines is derived from studies that frequently failed to report race/ethnicity and is not reflective of the U.S. POPULATION Black, Hispanic, and American Indian/Alaska Native participants that are underrepresented in U.S.-based studies, highlighting the need for more inclusive recruitment strategies in overactive bladder research.","Brown, Oluwateniola; Siddique, Moiuri; Mou, Tsung; Boniface, Emily R; Volpe, Katherine A; Cichowski, Sara",Female pelvic medicine & reconstructive surgery,289,1

METHODS An electronic health record observational study of linked primary care data in England from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink and the Office for National Statistics deaths data from 2000 to 2019 was undertaken. All-cause and cause-specific mortality for people with intellectual disabilities were calculated by gender and deprivation status (index of multiple deprivation quintile) using direct age-standardised mortality rates (all years) and ratios (SMR; 2000-2009 vs 2010-2019). RESULTS Among 1.0 million patients (n=33 844 with intellectual disability; n=980 586 general population without intellectual disability), differential mortality was consistently higher in people with intellectual disabilities and there was no evidence of attenuation over time. There was a dose-response relationship between all-cause mortality and lower deprivation quintile in the general population which was not observed in people with intellectual disabilities. Cause-specific SMR were consistent in both the 2000-2009 and 2010-2019 calendar periods, with a threefold increased risk of death in both males and females with intellectual disabilities (SMR ranges: 2.91-3.51). Mortality was highest from epilepsy (SMR ranges: 22.90-52.74) and aspiration pneumonia (SMR ranges: 19.31-35.44). SMRs were disproportionately high for people with intellectual disabilities living in the least deprived areas. CONCLUSIONS People with intellectual disabilities in England continue to experience significant mortality disparities and there is no evidence that the situation is improving. Deprivation indicators may not be effective for targeting vulnerable individuals.","Tyrer, Freya; Morriss, Richard; Kiani, Reza; Gangadharan, Satheesh K; Rutherford, Mark J",Journal of epidemiology and community health,289,30

OBJECTIVE This study evaluates the patient-reported Health Related Quality of Life outcomes and radiographic parameters of patients who underwent a single level transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion with either a polyetheretherketone (PEEK) or titanium interbody cage. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA Spinal stenosis with instability is a common diagnosis that is often treated with interbody fusion, in particular transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion. Titanium and PEEK interbody cage properties have been extensively studied to understand their effect on fusion rates and subsidence. MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective cohort study was conducted from a single, high volume, academic hospital. Health Related Quality of Life outcomes were obtained from Outcomes Based Electronic Research Database and electronic medical record chart review. Subsidence was defined as a loss of 2 mm or more in the anterior or posterior disk height. Spinopelvic alignment parameters measured were sacral slope, pelvic tilt, pelvic incidence, lumbar lordosis, segmental lordosis, and pelvic incidence-lumbar lordosis mismatch. Fusion rates were assessed by the Brantigan-Steffee criteria. RESULTS The study included a total of 137 patients (108 PEEK, 29 titanium). Overall, no significant changes were noted between the 2 groups at 3 month or 1-year follow-up. Perioperatively, patients did report improvement in all outcome parameters within the PEEK and titanium groups. No significant difference was noted in subsidence rate between the 2 groups. Segmental lordosis significantly increased within the PEEK (+4.8 degrees; P<0.001) and titanium (+4.6 degrees; P=0.003) cage groups, however no difference was noted between groups. No significant difference was noted in fusion between the PEEK and titanium cage cohorts (92.6% vs. 86.2%; P=0.36). CONCLUSION Overall, while PEEK and titanium cages exhibit unique biomaterial properties, our study shows that there were no significant differences with respect to patient-reported outcomes or radiographic outcomes between the 2 groups at the 1-year follow-up time point.

A total of 120 fish, being 60 fish for species (30 in the warm season and 30 in the cold season) were examined. Water quality was measured weekly to evaluate the interaction between environmental conditions and parasitism. Fifteen species of parasites were found: Ichthyophthirius multifiliis, Chilodonella hexasticha e Trichodina sp. (Protozoa), Henneguya piaractus, Myxobolus colossomatis and Myxobolus cuneus (Myxozoa); Anacanthorus penilabiatus, Mymarothecium boegeri, Mymarothecium viatorum, and Notozothecium janauachensis (Monogenoidea), Goezia spinulosa and Goezia sp.

METHODS In a rat model, one mesh (2 × 2 cm) was implanted subcutaneously in n = 60 rats. Animals were euthanized after 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, or 24 weeks (n = 5/mesh/time point), and implant sites were assessed for host inflammatory response and overall fibrotic repair thickness. In a rabbit model, meshes (3.8 cm diameter) were bilaterally implanted in subcutaneous pockets in n = 20 rabbits (n = 10 rabbits/mesh) and inoculated with 108 CFU clinically isolated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). One mesh type was implanted per animal. Animals were euthanized after 7 days, and implants were assessed for abscess formation, bacterial colonization, and mechanical strength. RESULTS In the rat study, Phasix™ and Bio-A® exhibited similar biocompatibility, although Bio-A® demonstrated a significantly greater inflammatory response at 4 weeks compared to Phasix™ (p < 0.01). Morphometric analysis demonstrated rapid resorption of Bio-A® implants with initially thicker repair sites at 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks (p < 0.0001), which transitioned to significantly thinner sites compared to Phasix™ at 16 and 24 weeks (p < 0.0001). In the rabbit bacterial inoculation study, Phasix™ exhibited significantly lower abscess score (p < 0.001) and bacterial colonization (p < 0.01), with significantly greater mechanical strength than Bio-A® (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Host response, resorption, repair thickness, strength, and bacterial colonization suggest a more stable and favorable outcome for monofilament, macroporous devices such as Phasix™ relative to multifilament, microporous devices such as Bio-A® over time.","Stoikes, N F N; Scott, J R; Badhwar, A; Deeken, C R; Voeller, G R",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,289,7

AIM To evaluate the most common bacterial and viral agents in CAP using a fast responsive PCR method and investigate the relationship between clinical/laboratory features and aetiology, thereby contributing to empirical antibiotic selection and reduction of treatment failure. METHODS In children aged 4-15 years consecutively admitted with a diagnosis of CAP, the 10 most commonly detected bacterial and 12 most commonly detected viral agents were investigated by induced sputum using bacterial culture and multiplex PCR methods. Clinical and laboratory features were compared between bacterial and viral pneumonia. RESULTS In 78 patients, at least one virus was detected in 38 (48.7%) and at least one bacterium in 32 (41%). In addition, both bacteria and viruses were detected in 16 (20.5%) patients. Overall, the agent detection rate was 69.2%. The most common viruses were respiratory syncytial virus and influenza and the most frequently detected bacteria were S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae. PCR was superior to culture for bacterial isolation (41% vs 13%, respectively). Fever, wheezing and radiological features were not helpful in differentiating between bacterial and viral CAP. White blood cell count, CRP and ESR values were significantly higher in the bacterial/mixed aetiology group than in the viral aetiology group. CONCLUSION In CAP, multiplex PCR is highly reliable, superior in detecting multiple pathogens and rapidly identifies aetiological agents. Clinical features are poor for differentiation between bacterial and viral infections. The use of PCR methods allow physicians to provide more appropriate antimicrobial therapy, resulting in a better response to treatment, and it may be possible for use as a routine service if costs can be reduced.","Aydemir, Yusuf; Aydemir, Özlem; Pekcan, Sevgi; Özdemir, Mehmet",Paediatrics and international child health,289,24

The objective of this study was to identify the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the opioid epidemic in the state of Ohio by describing the changes in the quarterly opioid overdose deaths (OOD) over the last 10 years. METHODS This longitudinal study included OOD data from death records obtained through the Ohio Department of Health. Temporal trend analysis and visualizations were performed on the OOD death rate per 100,000 quarterly from 2010 to 2020. Age, sex, and ethnicity were also analyzed. RESULTS The OOD rate of 11.15 in Q2 of 2020 was statistically equivalent to the previous peak level of 10.87 in Q1 of 2017. There was a significant increase in the OOD rate from Q1 to Q2 of 2020 and a significant difference between the actual Q2 of 2020 OOD rate and the predicted OOD rate. The poisoning indicator fentanyl was present in 94% of OOD during Q2 of 2020. The total number of OOD remains highest in the White population. There was no significant difference between the actual and predicted OOD rates in the Black population of Q2 of 2020 based on the trend line. However, the OOD rate of 14.29 in Q2 of 2020 was significantly higher than the previous peak level of 8.34 in Q2 of 2017. The Q2 of 2020 OOD rates for 18 to 39 and 40+ age groups were significantly higher from what would be expected from the trend predictions. CONCLUSIONS Based on these findings, Ohio has entered a COVID19 pandemic mediated fourth wave in the opioid epidemic. These findings further suggest that as efforts are made to address the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic, states need to maintain their vigilance toward combating the local opioid epidemic.","Vieson, Jamie; Yeh, Arthur B; Lan, Qizhen; Sprague, Jon E",Journal of addiction medicine,289,12

The study aimed to analyze the profile of COVID-19 symptoms and related aspects in Brazil. The author analyzed the sample of participants from the Brazilian National Household Sample Survey (PNAD-COVID19) conducted in May 2020. Latent class analysis (LCA) was performed with sociodemographic covariables and 11 symptoms reported by 346,181 individuals. Rao-Scott test and standardized residual analysis were used to measure the association with the pattern of health services use. Spatial scan analysis was performed to identify areas at risk of COVID-19 cases. LCA showed six classes of symptoms based on the pattern of answers by participants: (1) all the symptoms; (2) high prevalence of symptoms; (3) predominance of fever; (4) predominance of cough/sore throat; (5) mild symptoms with predominance of headache; and (6) absence of symptoms. Female sex, brown skin color, the North and Northeast regions of Brazil, and all three older age brackets showed stronger association with the class with all the symptoms (class 1). Most use of health services was also by this group of individuals, but with different profiles of use. Spatial analysis showed juxtaposition of this class with areas at greater risk of COVID-19. These finding underline the importance of investigating symptoms for the epidemiological identification of possible cases in a scenario with low population testing rates.","Moreira, Rafael da Silveira",Cadernos de saude publica,289,1

However, such effect and risk are still needed to be examined during indoor sports/exercises. The current study investigated the diurnal relationships between thermoregulatory strain and environmental heat stress during regular judo training in a judo training facility without air conditioning on a clear day in the heat of summer. METHODS Eight male high school judokas completed two 2.5-h indoor judo training sessions. The sessions were commenced at 09:00 h (AM) and 16:00 h (PM) on separate days. RESULTS During the sessions, indoor and outdoor heat stress progressively increased in AM but decreased in PM, and indoor heat stress was less in AM than PM (mean ambient temperature: AM 32.7±0.4°C; PM 34.4±1.0°C, P<0.01). Mean skin temperature was higher in AM than PM (P<0.05), despite greater dry and evaporative heat losses in AM than PM (P<0.001). Infrared tympanic temperature, heart rate and thermal sensation demonstrated a trial by time interaction (P<0.001) with no differences at any time point between trials, showing relatively higher responses in these variables in PM compared to AM during the early stages of training and in AM compared to PM during the later stages of training. There were no differences between trials in body mass loss and rating of perceived exertion. CONCLUSIONS This study indicates a greater thermoregulatory strain in the morning from 09:00 h than the late afternoon from 16:00 h during 2.5-h regular judo training in no air conditioning facility on a clear day in the heat of summer. This observation is associated with a progressive increase in indoor and outdoor heat stress in the morning, despite a less indoor heat stress in the morning than the afternoon.","Otani, Hidenori; Goto, Takayuki; Kobayashi, Yuki; Shirato, Minayuki; Goto, Heita; Hosokawa, Yuri; Tokizawa, Ken; Kaya, Mitsuharu",PloS one,289,1

Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is one of the most serious complications of cardiac surgery. Permissive hypercapnia (PHC), an important lung-protective ventilation strategy, has protective effects on vital organs, including the heart, lungs, and central nervous system (CNS). The main objective of this study is to assess the effect of the PHC ventilation strategy on rSO2 and postoperative cognitive function in patients undergoing CVR. METHODS A total of 66 patients undergoing CVR were included and randomly divided into the PHC ventilation group (Group H, n=33) and conventional ventilation group (Group C, n=33). Patients of both groups were subjected to conventional ventilation before cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). patients in Group H were subjected to the PHC ventilation strategy to keep the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) at 46-60 mmHg. RESULTS (I) Group H had a lower HR at T0 and T1 (P<0.05) and higher CO at T3 and T4 (P<0.05) than Group C. (II) Group H had higher rSO2 at T4 (P<0.05), lower pH and lactate (Lac) at T4 (P<0.05), higher PaCO2 at T3 and T4 (P<0.05), and lower PaO2 at T3 and T4 (P<0.05). (III) Compared to 1 d before surgery, the MMSE scores of both groups were lower 24 h after surgery (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS PHC can increase the rSO2 of patients undergoing CVR, increase cerebral blood flow, improve the cerebral oxygen supply/consumption balance, and play a protective role in the brain. It has no significant impact on the incidence of POCD.","Zhu, Longchang; Shi, Hongwei; Zhu, Cheng; Liu, Hanyu; Su, Zhonghong; Zhao, Yamei",Annals of palliative medicine,289,25

Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is readily available from routine blood testing of patients diagnosed with cancer. METHODS Peer-reviewed publications from PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science and EMBASE were identified according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Hazard ratios (HR) for overall survival (OS) and surrogate endpoints (SE; comprising disease-, recurrence- and progression-free survival) were pooled using a random effects model. Additional analysis was carried out to further investigate NLR as an independent prognostic factor and account for heterogeneity. RESULTS Seventy-one eligible papers comprising 32,788 patients were identified. High NLR was associated with poor clinical outcomes. Significant publication bias was observed, and larger studies also adjusted for more covariates. Correcting for publication bias in multivariate studies brought our best estimate for true effect size to HR = 1.57 (95% CI 1.39-1.78; p < 0.0001) for OS and to HR = 1.38 (95% CI 1.16-1.64; p = 0.0003) for SE. CONCLUSIONS NLR is confirmed as an easily available prognostic biomarker in colorectal cancer, despite the limitations of some studies previously reporting this finding. As such, it should be routinely collected in prospective clinical trials. While more standardised and rigorous large-scale studies are needed before high NLR can be fully assessed as an independent predictor of CRC progression and outcome, the data suggest that it may be used to highlight individuals with tumour-promoting inflammatory context.","Naszai, Mate; Kurjan, Alina; Maughan, Timothy S",Cancer medicine,289,17

Diarrhoeal faecal samples were collected from 590 calves (<3 months old) throughout the country from November 2013 through March 2015. Data were analysed according to the region of collection, season, and type of diarrhoea. Of the 590 collected faecal samples, 77 (13.1 per cent) and 78 (13.2 per cent; true prevalence 9.1 per cent) tested positive by PCR and ELISA, respectively. The results from both testing methods were in agreement in 501 (84.9 per cent) samples, with a κ value of 0.34, which suggests fair agreement. The PCR results showed a higher prevalence in summer and in cases of haemorrhagic diarrhoea (P<0.05), while the ELISA results showed a lower prevalence in cases of pasty diarrhoea (P<0.05). Phylogenetic analysis of the β-giardin gene sequences of G duodenalis showed that the sequences detected in this study belonged to assemblage E, which is specific to cattle and livestock. The higher prevalence of giardiasis in calves with haemorrhagic diarrhoea found in this study differed from previous studies. Therefore, researchers and veterinarians should be aware of the possible involvement of giardiasis in haemorrhagic diarrhoea.","Lee, S H; VanBik, D; Kim, H Y; Cho, A; Kim, J W; Byun, J W; Oem, J K; Oh, S I; Kwak, D",The Veterinary record,289,16

MATERIALS AND METHODS Twenty-four different combinations of a total of 120 miniscrews of two different diameters (2.0mm and 2.3mm) and five different lengths (9mm, 11mm, 13mm and 15mm) were tested at different angles of insertion (90° and 45°) and distances from a synthetic bone block (3mm, 5mm, 7mm). Samples were fixed in an Instron Universal Testing Machine and a load was applied in single cantilever mode to the neck of each miniscrew. The stiffness and maximum load before permanent deformation were recorded. Model-based recursive partitioning testing (CART) was used to evaluate differences between groups. RESULTS Significantly higher forces were necessary to deform miniscrews of diameter 2.3mm than those of 2.0mm, those inserted at an angle of 45° with respect to 90°, and at smaller distances between the miniscrew neck and block; in addition, the maximum load and stiffness increased with increasing screw length. CONCLUSION This in vitro experimental study showed strong correlations between deformation load and miniscrew geometry, insertion angle and distance from the synthetic block, results that should be considered when planning miniscrew insertion in order to reduce the risk of unwanted fracture.","Colonna, Anna; Drudi, Margherita; Spedicato, Giorgio Alfredo; Mollica, Francesco; Mazzanti, Valentina; Paoletto, Emanuele; Maino, Giuliano; Siciliani, Giuseppe; Lombardo, Luca",International orthodontics,289,4

This included patient demographic data, intraoperative, and postoperative outcomes. RESULTS Thirty-three patients underwent conventional laparoscopic appendicectomy and 40 patients underwent SILS appendicectomy between January 26, 2008 and July 14, 2009. Operative time was shorter with SILS appendicectomy compared with conventional laparoscopic appendicectomy (p < 0.05). No patients in the SILS appendicectomy group required conversion to open surgery compared with two patients in the conventional laparoscopic appendicectomy group. Patients stayed an average of 1.36 days after SILS appendicectomy, and 2.36 days after conventional laparoscopic appendicectomy.

METHODS Seventeen physically active men (24.6 ± 4.3 years) completed 2 30-minute submaximal exercise tests (conditions: upright and recumbent cycle ergometry). Executive function was assessed using the ""color"" and ""word"" Stroop task, preexercise (resting) and postexercise. Regional oxygen saturation (rSO2) to the prefrontal cortex was continuously monitored using near-infrared spectroscopy. RESULTS Significant improvements in executive function (Stroop color and word tasks) were observed after 30 minutes of exercise for both upright and recumbent cycling (P < .05). However, there were no differences in executive function between cycling conditions (P > .05). A significant increase in rSO2 was recorded immediately postexercise compared with preexercise for both conditions (P < .05), with a trend (P = .06) for higher peak rSO2 following recumbent cycling compared with upright cycling (81.9% ± 6.5% cf 79.7% ± 9.3%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS Although submaximal cycling exercise acutely improves cognitive performance and prefrontal oxygenation, changes in cognition are not perceived to be dependent on body posture in young, healthy men.","Faulkner, James; Lambrick, Danielle; Kaufmann, Sebastian; Stoner, Lee",Journal of physical activity & health,289,20

We aimed to evaluate the incidence of PVT after hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma and identify coagulation and fibrinolytic factors that could predict early-stage postoperative PVT. METHODS A retrospective analysis was conducted on 65 hepatocellular carcinoma patients who underwent radical hepatectomy. The risk factors for postoperative PVT were identified based on univariate and multivariate analyses, and the levels of coagulation and fibrinolytic factors were measured during the perioperative period. RESULTS The incidence of PVT after hepatectomy was 20.0%. The patients were divided into two groups: those with PVT (n=13; PVT group) and those without PVT (n=52; no-PVT group). The frequency of the use of the Pringle maneuver during surgery was higher in the PVT group than in the no-PVT group, and the postoperative/preoperative ratios of thrombin-antithrombin III complex (TAT) and of D-dimer were significantly higher in the PVT group. CONCLUSION A high incidence of PVT was found in hepatocellular carcinoma patients after hepatectomy. The frequency of the Pringle maneuver is a potential risk factor for postoperative PVT, and the postoperative/preoperative TAT and D-dimer ratios may be used as early predictors of PVT after hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma.","Takata, Hideyuki; Hirakata, Atsushi; Ueda, Junji; Yokoyama, Tadashi; Maruyama, Hiroshi; Taniai, Nobuhiko; Takano, Ryotaro; Haruna, Takahiro; Makino, Hiroshi; Yoshida, Hiroshi",Langenbeck's archives of surgery,289,19

Here we employed the continuous constant pH molecular dynamics (CpHMD) simulations to decipher the acid/base roles of renin’s catalytic dyad and the conformational dynamics of the flap, which is a common structural feature among aspartyl proteases. The calculated pKa’s suggest that the catalytic Asp38 and Asp226 serve as the general base and acid, respectively, in agreement with experiment and supporting the hypothesis that renin’s neutral optimum pH is due to the substrate-induced pKa shifts of the aspartic dyad. The CpHMD data confirmed our previous hypothesis that hydrogen bond formation is the major determinant of the dyad pKa order. Additionally, our simulations showed that renin’s flap remains open regardless of pH, although a Tyr-inhibited state is occasionally formed above pH 5. These findings are discussed in comparison to the related aspartyl proteases, including β-secretases 1 and 2, capthepsin D, and plasmepsin II. Our work represents a first step towards a systematic understanding of the pH-dependent structure-dynamics-function relationships of pepsin-like aspartyl proteases that play important roles in biology and human disease states.","Ma, Shuhua; Henderson, Jack A.; Shen, Jana",bioRxiv,289,24

Such massively univariate analysis typically requires an adjustment for multiple testing in an attempt to maintain the family-wise error rate at a nominal level of 5%. First, we examine three sources of substantial information loss that are associated with the common practice under the massively univariate framework: (a) the hierarchical data structures (spatial units and trials) are not well maintained in the modeling process; (b) the adjustment for multiple testing leads to an artificial step of strict thresholding; (c) information is excessively reduced during both modeling and result reporting. These sources of information loss have far-reaching impacts on result interpretability as well as reproducibility in neuroimaging. Second, to improve inference efficiency, predictive accuracy, and generalizability, we propose a Bayesian multilevel modeling framework that closely characterizes the data hierarchies across spatial units and experimental trials. Rather than analyzing the data in a way that first creates multiplicity and then resorts to a post hoc solution to address them, we suggest directly incorporating the cross-space information into one single model under the Bayesian framework (so there is no multiplicity issue). Third, regardless of the modeling framework one adopts, we make four actionable suggestions to alleviate information waste and to improve reproducibility: 1) abandon strict dichotomization, 2) report full results, 3) quantify effects, and 4) model data hierarchies. We provide examples for all of these points using both demo and real studies, including the recent NARPS investigation.","Chen, Gang; Taylor, Paul A.; Stoddard, Joel; Cox, Robert W.; Bandettini, Peter A.; Pessoa, Luiz",bioRxiv,289,24

Students were removed from clinical experiences, barred from away rotations, left struggling to obtain Standard Letters of Evaluation (SLOE), and forced to interview virtually and make rank lists without visiting programs. Advisors struggled to provide effective advice with constantly evolving institutional and national guidelines while living through and working in the public health crisis. The primary objective of this study was to analyze advising patterns of EM advisors for EM-bound students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A 31-item survey with quantitative and qualitative questions was designed using an iterative process by a varied group of student advisors in the Council of Residency Directors (CORD) Advising Students Committee for EM (ASC-EM). This survey was distributed via the CORD list-serve during March 2021 to EM advisors (including program directors, assistant/associate program directors, clerkship directors and faculty advisors). Results: We analyzed 97 unique responses. Despite the need to convert to virtual learning, a majority of advisors (73.3%) did not recommend taking an online virtual EM away rotation. The majority of EM bound students obtained one SLOE (75%). 20% of advisors reported that compared to prior years they recommended more students to dual apply. 31% of respondents reported being unsure how many interviews their lower-third candidates received, while only 17% were unsure how many their upper-third candidates received. Respondents providing qualitative responses on the challenges of advising reported significant stressors of the novel uncertainty of the process (43.2%), the challenges of decreased in-person time with advisees (27%), the stress of balancing personal and professional responsibilities (16.2%), and SLOE-related stress (13.5%). 100% of advisors reported that EM educational blogs such as EMRA (Emergency Medicine Residents’ Association), SAEM (Society of Academic Emergency Medicine), and CORD guided how they advised students and all recommended students use those resources. Conclusion: The pandemic created unique advising challenges. Despite uncertainty in how to guide students, advisors were able to provide largely cohesive recommendations aligned with national consensus recommendations from EM organizations. Students also seemed to adhere to these recommendations, particularly in terms of obtaining a single SLOE. Advisors reported variation on clarity about how many interviews their students had received, specifically knowing less about their less competitive students. Our survey raises some concern for significant stressors faced by advisors, but most respondents were able to draw on a unified larger EM community for support in their advising roles. This study highlights just one aspect of a unique year faced by our specialty.","Camejo, M.; Estes, M.; Shandro, J.; Chandra, S.; Moffett, S.",Annals of Emergency Medicine,289,1

Using Sendai virus to model natural infection in mice, we combine 3D imaging, lineage-tracing, and single-cell genomics to show that AT1 cells have an intermediary role by persisting in areas depleted of alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells, mounting an interferon response, and receding from invading airway cells. Sendai virus infection mobilizes airway cells to form alveolar SOX2+ clusters without differentiating into AT1 or AT2 cells, as shown in influenza models. Intriguingly, large AT2-cell-depleted areas remain covered by AT1 cells, which we name “AT2-less regions”, and are replaced by SOX2+ clusters spreading both basally and luminally around AT1 cell extensions. AT2 cell proliferation and differentiation are largely confined to topologically distal regions – the end of airspace that could be in the periphery or middle of the lung – and form de novo alveolar surface, with limited contribution to in situ repair of AT2-less regions. Time course single-cell RNA-seq and AT1-cell interactome analyses suggest enhanced recognition of AT1 cells by immune cells and altered growth signals. Our comprehensive spatiotemporal and genome-wide study highlights the hitherto unappreciated role of AT1 cells during Sendai virus infection and possibly other injury-repair processes.","Hernandez, Belinda J; Cain, Margo P; Flores, Jose R; Tuvim, Michael J; Dickey, Burton F; Chen, Jichao",bioRxiv,289,1

Previous acute challenge studies suggested that short pulse widths might increase the therapeutic window while maintaining motor symptom control. Objectives: To investigate in patients with Parkinson`s disease and nucleus subthalamicus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) whether short pulse width stimulation with 30s maintains equal motor control as conventional 60s stimulation over a period of 4 weeks. Methods: In this monocentric, double-blinded, randomized crossover trial, 30 patients with Parkinson`s disease and STN-DBS were enrolled and assigned to 4 weeks of stimulation with 30s and 4 weeks of stimulation with 60s in randomized order (German Clinical Trials Register No. DRKS00017528). The primary outcome was the difference in motor symptom control as assessed by a motor diary. Secondary outcomes included energy consumption measures, non-motor effects, side-effects, and quality of life. Results: A total of 24 patients were included in the final analysis. There was no difference in motor symptom control between the two treatment conditions. Concerning secondary outcomes there was no difference in energy consumption, non-motor symptoms, side-effects, or quality of life. On the individual level, patients preferring 30s tended to be more dyskinetic in the 60s setting, whereas patients preferring 60s experienced more off-time in the 30s setting. Conclusions: Short pulse width settings (30s) provide equal motor symptom control as conventional (60s) stimulation without significant differences in energy consumption. Future studies are warranted to evaluate a potential benefit of short pulse width settings in patients with pronounced dyskinesia.","Petry-Schmelzer, J. N.; Schwarz, L.

PIVOT partnered with the Ministry of Public Health to pilot a new two-pronged approach for care delivery in rural Madagascar: one CHW provided care at a stationary CH site while 2-5 additional CHWs provided care via proactive household visits. The pilot included professionalization of the CHW workforce (i.e. recruitment, training, financial incentive) and twice monthly supervision of CHWs. We evaluated the impact of the CH pilot on utilization and quality of integrated community case management (iCCM) in the first six months of implementation (October 2019-March 2020). We compared utilization and proxy measures of quality of care (defined as adherence to the iCCM protocol for diagnosis, classification of disease severity, treatment) in the intervention commune and five comparison communes, using a quasi-experimental study design and relying on routinely collected programmatic data. Average per capita monthly under-five visits were 0.28 in the intervention commune and 0.22 in the comparison communes.

This unplanned redeployment raised concerns among various health care workers. The objective of the current study is to explore working dynamics and experience of junior and middle grade doctors during current pandemic. Methods: We organised a nationwide cross-sectional survey of junior and middle grade doctors working in the United Kingdom. The survey was aimed to study their level of participation during coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and its impact on their clinical practices and well-being. Results: In total, 1564 completed questionnaires with representations from all regions of the United Kingdom were included. The mean age of respondents was 30.64 years (95% confidence interval +1.025;standard deviation = 9.9057). There were 51.5% females with significantly more participants from Black, Asian, and minority ethnic group (n = 835, p = 0.0073);963 (61.6%, p ⩽ 0.0001) doctors were redeployed outside their primary speciality. The major redeployments were from other specialities to Intensive Therapy Units (41.8%, p ⩽ 0.001);63.3% of respondents spend more than 8 weeks in redeployed speciality (p ⩽ 0.0001). There was a significant impact of coronavirus disease 2019 on personal, mental, and physical well-being of doctors. The major areas requiring immediate attention include proper leadership and clinical support (64.1%), pre-redeployment planning and induction (48.5%), redeployment according to the skills and/or in familiar specialities (44.6%), and regular mental and physical well-being checks (37%). Conclusion: The outcome of the survey concluded with four major recommendations, including the need to have a named supervisor for these doctors, structured induction program, regular well-being checks, and involving them in crisis planning. These recommendations will help to shape future health care policies and management particularly when it is related to redeployment of doctors during any crisis or pandemic.","Abbas, M.; Ghazanfar, A.",SAGE Open Medicine,289,22

There were no statistically significant differences in citizens' knowledge by age and gender, but citizens with higher educational attainment had better knowledge scores. Participants equate the terms virus, bacteria and microorganisms, an error that can lead to misconceptions. We found that between 15.0 and 20.0% of citizens experience fear of microorganisms. Regarding gender, age and degree level, there were statistically significant differences in participants' opinions about microorganisms. 45.5% of the participants agreed that the topic of microorganisms is underrepresented in school. This is probably the reason why 44.2% of the participants are not interested in microbiology, although 74.6% are aware that knowledge about microorganisms is important and useful. Conclusion It would be good to strengthen the content and ways of working in the education system, because in case of a pandemic like SARS-CoV-2 there would be more understanding of what we are dealing with and less fear of the ignorant.","Spernjak, A.; Puhmeister, A.

Every critical investigation of how to defend our field thus proves to be highly valuable, but we in the humanities must also develop specific points concerning the importance of our research that will convince both students, parents, administrators, and politicians in concrete, pragmatic terms regarding the supreme relevance of college education. Fortunately, the current COVID-19 crisis has also profiled in a dramatic fashion what proves to be of fundamental importance for human life, both past and present, reminding us of the critical importance of the humanities. An existence without virtues, a completely narcissistic or egoistical concept of life, or a society entirely predicated on materialistic interests would cut us off from our own future.

Genetic analyses show that all known genetic variants of DBSV, including the ones identified in this study, are distinct from other Murinae-associated hantaviruses. DBSV variants show geographic clustering and high intraspecies diversity. The data suggest that DBSV is a distinct species in the genus Hantavirus. Interestingly, DBSV shows the highest sequence identity to Hantaan virus (HTNV), with a >7% difference in the sequences of the N, GPC, and L proteins, while N. confucianus is more closely related to Rattus norvegicus (the host of Seoul virus [SEOV]) than to Apodemus agrarius (the host of HTNV and Saaremaa virus [SAAV]). Further genetic analyses of all known Murinae-associated hantaviruses (both established and tentative species) show that many of them, including DBSV, may have originated from host switching. The estimation of evolutionary rates and divergence time supports the role of cross-species transmission in the evolution of Murinae-associated hantaviruses. The detection of positive selection suggests that genetic drift may contribute to the speciation of Murinae-associated hantaviruses and that adaptation has a role as well.","Lin, Xian-Dan; Wang, Wen; Guo, Wen-Ping; Zhang, Xiao-He; Xing, Jian-Guang; Chen, Sheng-Ze; Li, Ming-Hui; Chen, Yi; Xu, Jianguo; Plyusnin, Alexander; Zhang, Yong-Zhen",Journal of virology,289,19

Preventive measures such as hygiene, social distancing, and isolation, essential to stop the spread of coronavirus, are difficult to accomplish for vulnerable populations due to their living conditions. Seroepidemiological surveys are assets to measure the transmission for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Until July 1st, the incidence rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Barrio Padre Mugica, one of the largest slums in Buenos Aires City, was 5.9%. This study aimed to establish the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies immunoglobulin G (IgG) immediately after the outbreak, and to identify neighbourhood, household and individual factors associated with seroconversion. The prevalence based on IgG was 53.4% (95% CI 52.8% to 54.1%). For each polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) confirmed case, nine people tested IgG positive, indicating a high rate of undetected (probably asymptomatic) infections. Hence, the high rate of undiagnosed people suggests that clinical criteria and epidemiological nexus should be considered. The high seroprevalence observed in the context of an intense epidemic in a vulnerable area might serve as a reference to other countries. This study contributes to future decision making by understanding population immunity against SARS-CoV2 and its relation to living conditions and foccus that comprehensive biosocial, household-level interventions are needed.","Figar, Silvana; Pagotto, Vanina; Luna, Lorena; Salto, Julieta; Wagner Manslau, Magdalena; Mistchenko, Alicia S; Gamarnik, Andrea; Gómez Saldaño, Ana María; González Bernaldo de Quirós, Fernán",Medicina,289,31

In this study we evaluated the potential of vectors based on several of these novel AAVs as vaccine carriers for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Gag. Studies with mice indicated that vectors based on AAV type 7 (AAV7), AAV8, and AAV9 demonstrate improved immunogenicity in terms of Gag CD8(+) T-cell and Gag antibody responses. The quality of these antigen-specific responses was evaluated in detail for AAV2/8 vectors and compared to results with an adenovirus vector expressing Gag (AdC7). AAV2/8 produced a vibrant CD8(+) T-cell effector response characterized by coexpression of gamma interferon and tumor necrosis factor alpha as well as in vivo cytolytic activity. No CD8(+) T-cell response generated by any of the AAVs was effectively boosted with AdC7, a result consistent with the finding of a relative lack of cells expressing interleukin-2 (IL-2) or a central memory phenotype at 3 months after the prime. The primary response to an AdC7 vaccine differed from that generated by AAVs in that the peak effector response evolved into populations of Gag-specific T cells expressing high levels of cytokines, including IL-2, and with effector memory and central memory phenotypes. A number of mechanisms could be considered to explain the aberrant activation of CD8(+) T cells by AAV, including insufficient inflammatory responses, CD4 help, and/or chronic antigen expression and T-cell exhaustion. Interestingly, the B-cell response to AAV-encoded Gag was quite vibrant and easily boosted with AdC7.","Lin, Jianping; Zhi, Yan; Mays, Lauren; Wilson, James M",Journal of virology,289,5

These studies have lent support to both immune and viral mediated (independent of an immune response) cardiac damage. Acute myocarditis can present in various ways, and it may be a cause of sudden death in an otherwise healthy young adult. New treatments for viral heart disease are awaited. In the meanwhile, the haemodynamic support of patients with acute left ventricular failure caused by myocarditis should be aggressive, to allow for the possibility of spontaneous recovery. Contemporary trials of treatment in chronic heart failure secondary to dilated cardiomyopathy support the use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, beta adrenoceptor blockers, and spironolactone in such patients.","Kearney, M T; Cotton, J M; Richardson, P J; Shah, A M",Postgraduate medical journal,289,16

DESIGN Comparison of two samples from a case series at different time-points. SETTING General Outpatient Clinic, Hong Kong. PATIENTS Non-acute stroke patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria and regularly followed up in a local General Outpatient Clinic during the audit cycle were recruited. Evidence-based audit criteria and performance standards were established after thorough literature review. A sample from this case series was compared retrospectively at two time-points. First-phase evaluation was performed in October 2009 and deficiencies were identified. After 9 months of active intervention, second-phase evaluation was performed in July 2010. Chi squared test and student's t test were used to compare the significance of relevant changes noted. RESULTS First-phase data showed marked deficiencies in proper assessment of cardiovascular risk factors. Satisfactory blood pressure, glucose and lipid control was evident only in 47% of the hypertensive, 45% of the diabetic, and 37% of the dyslipidaemic stroke patients, respectively. After 9 months of implementing changes, significant improvements were noted with respect to standard targets being achieved. In the second phase, more comprehensive tackling of cardiovascular risk factors was noted, with satisfactory blood pressure control in 73% of hypertensive patients, and adequate metabolic control in 62% diabetic patients (P<0.01 for both). Only 59% of the dyslipidaemic stroke patients had optimal lipid control, though their mean low-density lipoprotein concentration was significantly reduced (P<0.05).

Accordingly, many studies on modeling the SARS epidemic have been reported, whereas deficiencies were still lying in those models because of their separate space/time methodology. In this paper, we propose novel comprehensive stochastic spatio-temporal models from both of the macro aspect and individual aspect for characterizing transmission and control of the SARS disease. Based on a new SARS spread process in consideration of ""suspicious"" population, we firstly establish the stochastic temporal models from two different aspects: the macro model is described with birth-death process and the individual Markov model is described with probability transition matrix (PTM). And then, we amalgamate the deterministic/stochastic population-flow model with the stochastic temporal models together to set up the comprehensive stochastic spatio-temporal models. Simulations on computer have evaluated the effect of various realistic parameters and control policies, and also have testified the accuracy and efficacy of the new models. Additionally, particular studies on the cases of Tsinghua University and Beijing City are presented. The comprehensive stochastic spatio-temporal models have considerably reduced the complexity plus errors as compared with previous works and will be able to characterize other various epidemics, e.g. Avian Flu.","Liu, Zihong; He, Ku; Yang, Lei; Bian, Chao; Wang, Zhihua",Conference proceedings : ...

However, there are few reports regarding the details of the procedure for LSPDP, and its safety remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and safety of LSPDP. METHODOLOGY Six patients underwent LSPDP from March 2009 to February 2013 in our center, and their clinical data and outcomes were reviewed retrospectively. RESULTS A total of six laparoscopic distal pancreatic resections were attempted in four female and two male patients. All of the operations were successful, with an average operative time of 290.7 min (range: 211-377 min) and an average blood loss of 43.5 g (range: 0-142 g). The mean hospital stay was 11.8 days (range: 9-17days). No obvious pancreatic fistulas occurred, although pseudocysts at the stump of the pancreas were recognized in three patients on CT scans performed at 7 days postoperatively. Postoperative pathological examinations revealed two cases of serous cystadenoma in the body and tail of the pancreas, one case of serous oligocystic adenoma, one case of mucinous cystadenoma, one case of neuroendocrine tumor, and one case of solid-pseudopapillary neoplasm.

It is shown that Remdesivir, a nucleoside drug that was originally invented for the Ebola virus, is effective in suppressing the replication of SARS-CoV-2 that causes COVID-19. Similarly, Galidesivir, Favipiravir, Ribavirin, N4-hydroxycytidine (EIDD-1931), and EIDD-2801 (a prodrug of EIDD-1931) were also found to be effective against COVID-19. However, the mechanisms of action of these drugs are not yet fully understood. For example, in some experimental studies, these drugs were proposed to act as a RNA-chain terminator, while in other studies, these were proposed to induce base-pair mutations above the error catastrophe limit to stall the replication of the viral RNA. To understand the mutagenic effects of these drugs, the role of different tautomers in their base-pairing abilities is studied here in detail by employing a reliable dispersion-corrected density functional theoretic method. It is found that Remdesivir and Galidesivir can adopt both amino and imino tautomeric conformations to base-pair with RNA bases. While the insertions of G and U are preferred against the amino tautomers of these drugs, the insertion of C is mainly possible against the imino tautomers. However, although Favipiravir and Ribavirin can make stable base pair interactions by using their keto and enol tautomers, the formation of the latter pairs would be less probable due to the endothermic nature of the products. Interestingly, the insertions of all of the RNA bases are found to be possible against the keto tautomer of Favipiravir, while the keto tautomer of Ribavirin has a clear preference for G. Remarkably, due to the negligible difference in the stability of EIDD-2801 and EIDD-1931, these tautomers would coexist in the biological environment. The insertion of G is found to be preferred against EIDD-1931 and the incorporations of U, A, and G are preferred opposite EIDD-2801. These findings suggest that base-pair mutations are the main causes of the antiviral properties of these drugs.","Jena, N R",PCCP. Phys. chem. chem. phys. (Print),289,20

Programs that do provide a teleneurology curriculum have demonstrated increased proficiency, accuracy, and post-training utilization among their trainees. With the current changes in healthcare, broad incorporation of teleneurology education in resident and fellow training after this pandemic dissipates will only serve to improve trainee preparedness for independent practice.The current COVID-19 pandemic is forcing a reckoning of current healthcare delivery and expediting a rapid transition to telemedicine-based care.

AIM: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of short-wave diathermy (SWD) treatment for moderate COVID-19 patients. DESIGN: A prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled clinical study. SETTING: Inpatients unit of a COVID-19 specialized hospital. POPULATION: Forty-two patients with moderate COVID-19 were randomly allocated at a 2:1 ratio to two groups: the SWD group and the control group. METHODS: Participants of the SWD group received SWD treatment, and participants of the control group received placebo SWD treatment for one session per day, 10 minutes per session, for no more than 14 days. Both groups were given standard care treatment. Primary outcome was the rate of clinical improvement according to a sevencategory ordinal scale. Secondary outcomes included the rate of computed tomography (CT) improvement and the rate of potential adverse events. RESULTS: Clinical improvement occurred in 92.6% of patients in the SWD group by day 14 compared with 69.2% of patients in the control group (P = 0.001). The Cox model indicated that the SWD group had a higher clinical improvement probability than the control group (Hazard Ratio, 3.045; 95% CI, 1.391-6.666; P = 0.005). Similarly, CT improvement occurred in 85.2 % of patients in the SWD group and 46.2 % of patients in the control group respectively by day 14 (P = 0.001). The Cox model indicated SWD group had a higher CT improvement probability than control group (Hazard Ratio, 3.720; 95% CI, 1.486-9.311; P = 0.005). There was no significant difference in adverse events between the SWD group and the control group (2 of 27 [7.4%] SWD vs. 1 of 13 [7.7%] control, P = 1.000), the most frequent of which were headache (1 of 27 [3.7%] SWD vs. 1 of 13 [7.7%] control patients) and dizziness (1 of 27 [3.7%] SWD vs. 0 of 13 [0%] control patients). CONCLUSIONS: SWD is a valid and reliable adjuvant therapy with a favorable safety profile for moderate COVID-19 patients. CLINICAL REHABILITATION IMPACT: Clinically relevant information is lacking regarding the efficacy and safety of SWD for patients with COVID-19. This study provides the first evidence that SWD is a promising adjuvant therapy for COVID-19.","Tian, Fei; Wang, Jin; Xi, Xiao; He, Miao; Zhao, Chenguang; Feng, Feng; Wang, Hongbin; Sun, Wei; Mao, Li; Hu, Xu; Sun, Xiaolong; Yuan, Hua",Eur. j. phys. rehabil. med.

This study aims to perform a survey of their knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) associated with COVID-19. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was designed to gather information regarding the COVID-19 related KAP among undergraduates during the home isolation in the outbreak. Subjects were recruited from 10 universities in Shaanxi Province, China. Enrollees voluntarily submitted their answers to a pre-designed questionnaire online. RESULTS: A total of 872 subjects (female, 534; male, 338) were enrolled with ages from 17 to 25 years old. This cohort included 430 medical and 442 non-medical students, 580 freshmen and 292 higher school year students. There were 453 from public schools and 442 from private school, residing in 28 regions and provinces at the time of study. Results showed that appropriate knowledge was acquired by 82.34% subjects; the levels were significantly higher in undergraduates from public universities and medical majors than those from private schools and non-medical majors (p<0.05). 73.81% subjects reported positive attitudes; females showed significantly higher levels of positive attitudes than males (p<0.05). Proactive practice was found in 87.94% subjects. Using a common scoring method, the overall scores for Knowledge, Attitude and Practice were 4.12 ± 0.749 (range: 0 ~ 5), 8.54 ± 1.201 (range: 0 ~ 10), and 8.91 ± 1.431 (range: 0 ~ 10), respectively. There was a positive correlation between attitude and practice (r = 0.319, p < 0.05) in the whole study group. Total KAP score was 21.57 ± 2.291 (range: 0 ~ 25), which was significantly different between gender groups and major groups. CONCLUSIONS: Most undergraduates acquired necessary knowledge, positive attitude and proactive practice in response to COVID-19 outbreak; but their KAP scores significantly varied by gender, major and school types.","Peng, Yaling; Pei, Chenchen; Zheng, Yan; Wang, Juan; Zhang, Kui; Zheng, Zhaohui; Zhu, Ping",BMC Public Health,289,16

METHODS: Clinical characteristics and outcomes were retrospectively analysed of patients - with laboratory-confirmed bilateral COVID-19 pneumonia, hyperinflammation (C-reactive protein (CRP) &#8805;20 mg/dL), no hypoxaemia (oxygen saturation >90%), and no contraindications to TCZ - who were treated with subcutaneous TCZ (324 mg) administered within 48 h from hospitalization on top of standard of care (SOC). They were compared with matched controls treated with SOC only before TCZ was available at the institution. Clinical data were available for all patients until death or until day 35 for those discharged from hospital. FINDINGS: Ten consecutive patients (six males, median age 55 years) treated with TCZ on top of SOC, and ten patients (six males, median age 56 years) treated with SOC only were included. TCZ was well-tolerated with no clinically relevant adverse events. TCZ was associated with a reduction in CRP at day 1 (-50%, IQR -28 to -80) and day 3 (-89%, IQR -79 to -96; p = 0.005 for within-group), whereas there was no significant change in CRP values in the SOC group (p < 0.001 for between-group comparisons at both time points). TCZ resulted in a parallel improvement in oxygenation, as assessed by the ratio of partial pressure of oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen (P/F) ratio, which increased at day 1 (+11%, IQR +6 to +16; p = 0.005 for within-group and p = 0.006 for between-group comparisons), and day 3 (+23%, IQR +16 to +34; p = 0.005 for within-group and p = 0.003 for between-group comparisons). None of the TCZ-treated patients had disease progression, defined as requirement of oxygen therapy or mechanical ventilation, whereas progression occurred in five (50%) patients among the SOC group. CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose subcutaneous TCZ may be a safe and promising therapeutic option administered on top of SOC to prevent disease progression in hospitalised patients with moderate COVID-19 and hyperinflammation.","Potere, Nicola; Di Nisio, Marcello; Rizzo, Giulia; La Vella, Matteo; Polilli, Ennio; Agostinone, Adriana; Spacone, Antonella; Di Carlo, Silvio; Costantini, Alberto; Abbate, Antonio; Porreca, Ettore; Parruti, Giustino",Int J Infect Dis,289,16

Healthcare workers in particular have experienced increased levels of psychological distress, depression and anxiety. Any perceived stress to an individual can provoke psychological defence mechanisms. Using psychoanalytic theory, a defence mechanism is described as an unconscious psychological strategy, with or without resulting behaviour, which aims to reduce or eliminate anxiety arising from unacceptable or potentially harmful stimuli. This paper aims to describe a range of psychological defence mechanisms encountered within colleagues in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Using the methodology of a case series, specific defence mechanisms are explored with reference to further literature in the field. Results: The author has encountered varying psychological defence mechanisms, both within himself and in other members of the multidisciplinary team. These have been illustrated in the attached clinical vignettes, relating to the specific psychological coping mechanisms of; denial, hypochondriasis, altruism, sublimation and humour. Conclusion: We encourage acknowledgement of psychological defence mechanisms and their implications on day to day practice. Whilst defence mechanisms can have a number of negative consequences as described in this article, they also have an important role, particularly in the case of mature defence mechanisms, as protective factors against psychological distress and symptom formation. Deeper understanding of the gold-standard hierarchical organization of defence mechanisms could help increase utilisation of specific therapeutic interventions for enhancing changes from immature to mature defensive responses to stressful experiences as the COVID-19 pandemic progresses.","Walker, Graham; McCabe, Thomas",European journal of psychiatry,289,32

We aim to investigate the dynamic changes of immune status in COVID-19 patients with clinical evolution. METHODS: Sixty-one COVID-19 patients (42 mild cases and 19 severe cases, 51 cases without secondary infection as non-infection group and 10 cases with secondary bacterial/fungal infection as infection group) and 52 healthy controls (HCs) were enrolled from our hospital. Leucocyte classification, lymphocyte subsets and cytokines were detected by full-automatic blood cell analyzer and flow cytometer, respectively. RESULTS: Upon admission, eosinophils and lymphocyte subsets decreased significantly, while neutrophils, monocytes, basophils, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10 and IFN-Î³ increased significantly in COVID-19 patients compared to HCs. CD3+ T and DN (CD3+CD4-CD8-) cells appeared sustained decline, leucocytes, neutrophils and IL-10 showed sustained increase in severe group compared to mild group. Compared with the non-infection group, we observed a depletion of eosinophils, CD3+ T and CD4+ T cells, but leucocytes, neutrophils, IL-6 and IL-10 on the contrary in the infection group. Besides, in severe group of COVID-19 patients, DN cells were negatively correlated with IL-10, and DP (CD3+CD4+CD8+) cells were negatively correlated with IL-6. Lymphocytes, eosinophils, CD3+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, IL-6 and IL-10 all had great diagnostic efficacy (AUC, 0.905-0.975) for COVID-19. The laboratory indicators of COVID-19 patients with improved condition also showed a recovery trend with time. CONCLUSIONS: The immune status of COVID-19 patients is different in each stage, and dynamic monitoring of related indicators can help predict the disease and may avoid cytokine storms.","Guan, Jingjing; Wei, Xin; Qin, Shuang; Liu, Xiaoyuan; Jiang, Yujie; Chen, Yingxiao; Chen, Yanfan; Lu, Hong; Qian, Jingjing; Wang, Zhongyong; Lin, Xiangyang",Int Immunopharmacol,289,16

The most established mechanism of viral entry into the body is considered to be via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) acting as a receptor for viral spike protein thereby facilitating its entry in the cell. However, ACE2 is also involved in providing the protection from severe pathological changes. This article provides a computational and bioinformatics-based analysis of ACE2 with an objective of providing further insight into the earnest efforts to determine its true position in COVID-19 pathology. The results of this study show that ACE2 has strikingly low expression in healthy human lung tissue and was absent from the list of differentially expressed genes. However, when transcription factors were analyzed, we found a significant upregulation of FOS and downregulation of FOXO4 and FOXP2. Moreover, the miRNA prediction analysis revealed that miR-1246, whose upregulation has been experimentally established to be a cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), was found to be targeting the coding DNA sequence (CDS) of ACE2. This study presents a wide range of potentially important transcription factors as well as miRNA targets associated with ACE2 which can be potentially used for drug designing amid this challenging pandemic situation.

This deficit has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, as the need for social distancing and the introduction of hybrid staffing models have decreased the critical educational interactions at the reading room workstations between staff and trainees. By leveraging interactive, case-based learning, educators have the opportunity to bridge the substantial gap between basic pattern recognition and successfully making a diagnosis in independent practice. For the educator, this signals a shift away from perfect case selection and presenter authority, and toward the role of a guide facilitating an active case-based learning experience. This form of learning is best accompanied by guided interpretation and iterative feedback with the goal of developing similar levels of mastery and autonomy among graduating trainees.

Electronic nose (eNose) technology is an emerging diagnostic tool for diagnosis and phenotyping of a wide variety of respiratory diseases. Hence, the accuracy of exhaled breath analysis by eNose was assessed for the discrimination between individuals with and without a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: This was a prospective real-world study of individuals (≥18 years of age) presenting to a public testing center in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, August 2020 for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Baseline breath profiles were obtained using the SpiroNose [1,2], a cloud-connected eNose, after sampling of a combined throat and nasopharyngeal swab. A SARS-CoV-2 infection was defined as a positive molecular amplification test at baseline and/or ≤7 days after inclusion. Data-analysis involved advanced signal processing, ambient correction and statistics based on independent t-tests followed by linear discriminant and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis [2]. The accuracy of the diagnostic model based on eNose sensor data was subsequently assessed in an independent validation set and in a replication set including newly presented individuals to the testing facilities in November 2020. Results: 1808 individuals with (n=68) and without (n=1760) SARS-CoV-2 infection were included, divided in a training (n=904) and validation (n=904) set. The eNose sensors were combined into a composite biomarker with an ROC-area under the curve (AUC) of 0.948 (95% Confidence Interval (CI):0.929-0.967) in the training set. These results were confirmed in the validation set (0.957;CI:0.942-0.971) and externally validated in a replication set with newly presented individuals (n=1089) with (n=151) and without (n=938) SARS-CoV-2 infection (0.935;CI:0.921-0.952) (Figure 1). A SARS-CoV-2 infection percentage score of 0.30 selected from the training set resulted in 100% sensitivity and 78% specificity in the validation set indicating that in 75% of individuals SARS-CoV-2 infection could have been reliably ruled out (0% false negative). In the replication set, the score resulted in 100% sensitivity and 80% specificity. Conclusions: Exhaled breath analysis by eNose can reliably distinguish between individuals with and without a SARS-CoV-2 infection in public health setting. This quick and non-invasive method can therefore be used as a screening instrument, eliminating the need for additional time-consuming, stressful, and expensive diagnostic tests. Thereby the number of required SARS-CoV-2 molecular amplification tests can be reduced by more than 70-75%. [1]de Vries R, Sterk PJ. J Allergy Clin Immunol. 2020 [2]de Vries R, Muller M, et al.

Many school districts would decide on a program and then change their decision based on the COVID-19 situation in their area. These changes caused education and personal issues for the students, teachers, parents, and others who worked in their school system. This paper explores how the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), a well-regarded, multi-criteria decision analysis approach, can be used to analyze this situation by developing two prototype versions of the AHP and illustrating these versions of the AHP with a detailed example. The team approach for analyzing this issue is also described. Additionally, the current situation of this problem in the United States and elsewhere is discussed. Finally, Professor Bodin is making software that he has developed available (at no cost) for carrying out many of the computations for the AHP versions described in this paper.","Bodin, Lawrence Frieman Barry",Urban Science,289,1

The disease associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection is named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). To date, real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the only test able to confirm this infection. However, the accuracy of RT-PCR depends on several factors; variations in these factors might significantly lower the sensitivity of detection. METHODS: In this study, we developed a peptide-based luminescent immunoassay that detected immunoglobulin (Ig)G and IgM. The assay cutoff value was determined by evaluating the sera from healthy and infected patients for pathogens other than SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: To evaluate assay performance, we detected IgG and IgM in the sera from confirmed patients. The positive rate of IgG and IgM was 71.4% and 57.2%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, combining our immunoassay with real-time RT-PCR might enhance the diagnostic accuracy of COVID-19.","Cai, Xue-Fei; Chen, Juan; Li Hu, Jie-; Long, Quan-Xin; Deng, Hai-Jun; Liu, Ping; Fan, Kai; Liao, Pu; Liu, Bei-Zhong; Wu, Gui-Cheng; Chen, Yao-Kai; Li, Zhi-Jie; Wang, Kun; Zhang, Xiao-Li; Tian, Wen-Guang; Xiang, Jiang-Lin; Du, Hong-Xin; Wang, Jing; Hu, Yuan; Tang, Ni; Lin, Yong; Ren, Ji-Hua; Huang, Lu-Yi; Wei, Jie; Gan, Chun-Yang; Chen, Yan-Meng; Gao, Qing-Zhu; Chen, A-Mei; He, Chang-Long; Wang, Dao-Xin; Hu, Peng; Zhou, Fa-Chun; Huang, Ai-Long; Wang, De-Qiang",J Infect Dis,289,20

The virus is now pandemic and widely disseminated to almost every continent and nation with globally over twenty-seven million infections and over ninety-thousand reported deaths attributed to the COVID-19 disease. SARS-CoV-2 is a single stranded RNA virus, similar in structure to that of other coronaviruses and comprising three main viral proteins; membrane (M), spike (S) and envelope (E). The clinical features of COVID-19 disease can be classified according to different degrees of severity, with some patients, particularly those of older age and with long-standing chronic illnesses, developing progressive respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring mechanical ventilation. In these severe cases, the disease can frequently be fatal. In addition, many infections are asymptomatic or only cause mild symptoms. As there is no specific treatment for COVID-19 there is considerable scientific endeavor globally to raise a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, in addition to engineering neutralizing antibody interventions. In the absence of an effective vaccine, interim measures involving movement control and lock downs of varying stringencies have been imposed, in order to control the spread of the virus. Whilst early enforced lockdown measures have been effective in reducing the spread of infection, these measures may prove to be less effective against the current and predominant strain of SARS-CoV-2, the G614 clade. Conversely, other mutations of the virus, such as the &#916;382 variant could reduce the clinical relevance of infection, and therefore may reduce the need for stringent movement control, particularly once vaccines become widely available. The front runners in the race to develop an effective vaccine focus on the SARS-Co-V-2 Spike protein. However, vaccines that produce a CD4 and CD8 response to a wider range of SARS-Co-V-2 viral proteins, may be more effective. Lastly, population based studies that determine the level of innate immunity to SARS-CoV-2 existing in the community, from prior exposure to the virus or to other coronaviruses, will have important implications for the stringencies of government imposed movement control and upon the strategic delivery of vaccination programmes.","Salvamani, S; Tan, H Z; Thang, W J; Ter, H C; Wa, M Shafiq; Gunasekaran, B; Rhodes, A",Br. j. biomed. sci,289,1

Matériels et méthodes Tous les patients adultes ayant eu un diagnostic par PCR d’infection à SARS-CoV-2 de mars à mai 2020 dans un hôpital français ont été inclus. Les femmes enceintes et les cas nosocomiaux ont été exclus. Les données des dossiers médicaux ont été recueillies de manière anonymisée via un e-CRF. L’adresse du patient a été utilisée pour obtenir l’IRIS du domicile et la correspondance avec deux indicateurs socioéconomiques validés : FDEP et French EDI. Les traitements empiriques utilisés par les praticiens ont été recueillis. Les facteurs associés à une forme grave, définie par la survenue du décès ou la nécessité d’une ventilation mécanique, ont été étudiés à l’aide de modèles de Cox. Résultats Parmi 399 patients inclus à partir des urgences, 78 patients sont retournés au domicile et 25 ont été transférés dans un autre hôpital.

Globally, case fatality rates have been linked to the strains/clades of circulating severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) within a specific country. Here we present 46 whole genomes of SARS-CoV-2 circulating in Ghana, from two separate sequencing batches: 15 isolates from the early epidemic (March 12-April 1 2020) and 31 from later time-points ( 25-27 May 2020). Sequencing was carried out on an Illumina MiSeq system following an amplicon-based enrichment for SARS-CoV-2 cDNA. After genome assembly and quality control processes, phylogenetic analysis showed that the first batch of 15 genomes clustered into five clades: 19A, 19B, 20A, 20B, and 20C, whereas the second batch of 31 genomes clustered to only three clades 19B, 20A, and 20B. The imported cases (6/46) mapped to circulating viruses in their countries of origin, namely, India, Hungary, Norway, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America. All genomes mapped to the original Wuhan strain with high similarity (99.5-99.8%). All imported strains mapped to the European superclade A, whereas 5/9 locally infected individuals harbored the B4 clade, from the East Asian superclade B. Ghana appears to have 19B and 20B as the two largest circulating clades based on our sequence analyses. In line with global reports, the D614G linked viruses seem to be predominating. Comparison of Ghanaian SARS-CoV-2 genomes with global genomes indicates that Ghanaian strains have not diverged significantly from circulating strains commonly imported into Africa. The low level of diversity in our genomes may indicate lower levels of transmission, even for D614G viruses, which is consistent with the relatively low levels of infection reported in Ghana.","Ngoi, Joyce M; Quashie, Peter K; Morang039,; a, Collins M; Bonney, Joseph Hk; Amuzu, Dominic Sy; Kumordjie, Selassie; Asante, Ivy A; Bonney, Evelyn Y; Eshun, Miriam; Boatemaa, Linda; Magnusen, Vanessa; Kotey, Erasmus N; Ndam, Nicaise T; Tei-Maya, Frederick; Arjarquah, Augustina K; Obodai, Evangeline; Otchere, Isaac D; Bediako, Yaw; Mutungi, Joe K; Amenga-Etego, Lucas N; Odoom, John K; Anang, Abraham K; Kyei, George B; Adu, Bright; Ampofo, William K; Awandare, Gordon A",Exp Biol Med (Maywood),289,1

Prophylaxis with palivizumab may reduce RSV infection, but its prescription is restricted to high-risk groups. The aim of the study is to retrospectively determine acute hospitalization costs of bronchiolitis. Materials and methods: Infants aged 1 month−1 year, admitted to Bambino Gesù Children Hospital, Rome, Italy, with a diagnosis of bronchiolitis from January 1 till December 31, 2017, were included in the study. Results: A total of 531 patients were enrolled in the study, and the mean age was 78.75 days. The main etiologic agent causing bronchiolitis was RSV, accounting for 58.38% of infections. The total cost of bronchiolitis hospitalization was 2,958,786 euros. The mean cost per patient was significantly higher in the case of RSV (5,753.43 ± 2,041.62 euros) compared to other etiology (5,395.15 ± 2,040.87 euros) (p = 0.04). Discussion: The study confirms the high hospitalization cost associated with bronchiolitis. In detail, in the case of RSV etiology, the cost was higher compared to other etiology, which is likely due to the longer hospitalization and the more frequent admission to the intensive cure department. Conclusion: This study highlights that bronchiolitis is an important cost item even in a tertiary hospital and that cost-effective interventions targeting RSV are increasingly urgent.","Bozzola, E.; Ciarlitto, C.; Guolo, S.; Brusco, C.; Cerone, G.; Antilici, L.; Schettini, L.; Piscitelli, A.

Data were collected between 9 June and 18 July 2020 during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, when the country was under a partial lockdown. COVID-19-related psychological distress was assessed using the Kessler 6-item Psychological Distress Scale (K6). We performed weighted modified Poisson regression analyses to identify significant predictors of moderate/severe psychological distress (K6 scores: &#8805;5). The weighted prevalences of moderate (K6 scores: 5-12) and severe psychological distress (K6 scores: &#8805;13) were 41.7% and 5.4%, respectively. Participants reported several perceived COVID-19-related stressors, including worries and fears of the contagion-specific death, serious need for food and money, and concerns about loss of income or business. The weighted prevalence of suicidal ideation was 1.5%. Statistically significant predictors of increased risk for moderate/severe psychological distress included living in the Hhohho and Manzini regions; feeling not well informed about COVID-19; feeling lonely; having received COVID-19 food or financial relief from the government; feeling burdened by the lockdown; being married; and being youth (18-24 years). The results call for the government to urgently augment the provision of mental health services during the pandemic. Mental health practitioners and programs may use several stressors and risk factors identified in this study to inform interventions and government policies aimed at reducing psychological distress induced by the pandemic.","Shongwe, Mduduzi Colani; Huang, Song-Lih",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),289,32

DESIGN: Retrospective, observational before-and-after study METHODS: Review and characterization of each emergent/urgent procedure performed during April 2020 and April 2019 at a single tertiary ophthalmology referral center. Information collected included the details of patient presentation, diagnosis, surgical procedure, and preoperative COVID-19 testing. RESULTS: In total, 117 surgical procedures were performed on 114 patients during the month of April 2020 compared with 1,107 performed in April 2019 (p< 0.0001). Retinal detachment repair was the most common procedure (37, 31.6%) in April 2020 while elective cataract surgery (481, 47.3%) was most common in April 2019. The mean age of patients was 50.0 years in April of 2020 compared to 59.0 years (p<0.0001) the year prior. During April 2020, the mean age of surgeons performing procedures was 42.3 years compared to 48.4 years (p<0.0001) during April 2019. In April 2020, all but 5 patients (96%) had RT-PCR based COVID-19 testing prior to their procedure. One patient (0.88%) had a positive COVID-19 test. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic decreased our institution's surgical volume in April 2020 to approximately 10% of the usual volume. The pandemic changed the type of cases performed and led to a statistically significant decrease in both the age of our surgeons and patients relative to the same interval in the year prior.

We propose a stochastic-based model-called Co-Wish-to understand how competition between two viruses over a shared niche can affect the spread of each virus in infected tissue. To demonstrate the co-infection of two viruses, we first simulate the characteristics of two virus growth processes separately. Then, we examine their interactions until one can dominate the other. We use Co-Wish to explore how the model varies as the parameters of each virus growth process change when two viruses infect the host simultaneously. We will also investigate the effect of the delayed initiation of each infection. Moreover, Co-Wish not only examines the co-infection at the cell level but also includes the innate immune response during viral infection. The results highlight that the waiting times in the five stages of the viral infection of a cell in the model-namely attachment, penetration, eclipse, replication, and release-play an essential role in the competition between the two viruses. While it could prove challenging to fully understand the therapeutic potentials of viral co-infection, we discuss that our theoretical framework hints at an intriguing research direction in applying co-infection dynamics in controlling any viral outbreak's speed.","Vafadar, Safar; Shahdoust, Maryam; Kalirad, Ata; Zakeri, Pooya; Sadeghi, Mehdi",PLoS One,289,24

Able to address the multi-factorial and dynamic pathophysiology of SCI, cells present various advantages over standard pharmacological approaches. However, the use of live cells is also severely hampered by logistical and practical considerations. These include specialized equipment and expertise, standardisation of cell stocks, sustained cell viability post-thawing and cryopreservation-induced delayed-onset cell death (CIDOCD). For this reason, we suggest a novel and clinically translatable alternative to live cell systemic infusion, which retains the efficacy of the latter whilst overcoming many of its limitations. This strategy involves the administration of concentrated cell secretome and exploits the trophic mechanism by which stromal cells function. Here, we compare the efficacy of intravenously delivered concentrated conditioned media (CM) from human umbilical cord matrix cells (HUCMCs), bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (BMSCs), as well as newborn and adult fibroblasts in a rat model of moderately severe cervical clip compression/contusion injury (C7-T1, 35-gram). This is further paired with a thorough profile of the CM cytokines, chemokines and angiogenic factors. The HUCMC-derived CM was most effective at limiting acute (48 hours post-SCI) vascular pathology, specifically lesion volume and functional vascularity. PCA, hierarchical clustering, and interaction analysis of proteins highly expressed in the HUCMC secretome, suggest involvement of the MAPK/ERK, JAK/STAT, and immune cell migratory pathways. This 'secretotherapeutic' strategy represents a novel and minimally invasive method to target multiple organ systems and several pathologies shortly after traumatic SCI.","Vawda, Reaz; Badner, Anna; Hong, James; Mikhail, Mirriam; Dragas, Rachel; Xhima, Kristiana; Jose, Alejandro; Fehlings, Michael G",Stem cells dev,289,1

Although measures to control SARS-CoV-2, namely, vaccination, medication, and chemical disinfectants are being investigated, there is an increase in the demand for auxiliary antiviral approaches using natural compounds. Here we have focused on hydroxytyrosol (HT)-rich aqueous olive pulp extract (HIDROX®) and evaluated its SARS-CoV-2-inactivating activity in vitro. We showed that the HIDROX solution exhibits time- and concentration-dependent SARS-CoV-2-inactivating activities, and that HIDROX has more potent virucidal activity than pure HT. The evaluation of the mechanism of action suggested that both HIDROX and HT induced structural changes in SARS-CoV-2, which changed the molecular weight of the spike proteins. Even though the spike protein is highly glycosylated, this change was induced regardless of the glycosylation status. In addition, HIDROX or HT treatment disrupted the viral genome. Moreover, the HIDROX-containing cream applied on film showed time- and concentration-dependent SARS-CoV-2-inactivating activities. Thus, the HIDROX-containing cream can be applied topically as an antiviral hand cream.

Prior studies have not investigated the reliability of different fluorescent tracers for the purpose of studying aerosols and small droplets. Objectives include (1) comparing vitamin B2, fluorescein, and a commercial fluorescent green dye in terms of particle dispersion pattern, suspension into aerosols and small droplets, and fluorescence in aerosolized form and (2) determining the utility of vitamin B2 as a fluorescent tracer coating the aerodigestive tract mucosa in otolaryngology contamination models. METHODS: Vitamin B2, fluorescein, and a commercial fluorescent dye were aerosolized using a nebulizer and passed through the nasal cavity from the trachea in a retrograde-intubated cadaveric head. In another scenario, vitamin B2 was irrigated to coat the nasal cavity and nasopharyngeal mucosa of a cadaveric head for assessment of aerosol and droplet generation from endonasal drilling. A cascade impactor was used to collect aerosols and small droplets &#8804;14.1 µm based on average aerodynamic diameter, and the collection chambers were visualized under UV light. RESULTS: When vitamin B2 was nebulized, aerosols &#8804;5.4 µm were generated and the collected particles were fluorescent. When fluorescein and the commercial water tracer dye were nebulized, aerosols &#8804;8.61 µm and &#8804;2.08 µm respectively were generated, but the collected aerosols did not appear visibly fluorescent. Endonasal drilling in the nasopharynx coated with vitamin B2 irrigation yielded aerosols &#8804;3.30 µm that were fluorescent under UV light. CONCLUSION: Vitamin B2's reliability as a fluorescent tracer when suspended in aerosols and small droplets &#8804;14.1 µm and known mucosal safety profile make it an ideal compound compared to fluorescein and commercial water-based fluorescent dyes for use as a safe fluorescent tracer in healthcare contamination models especially with human subjects.","Sim, Edward S; Dharmarajan, Harish; Boorgu, Devi Sai Sri Kavya; Goyal, Lindsey; Weinstock, Michael; Whelan, Rachel; Freiser, Monika E; Corcoran, Timothy E; Jabbour, Noel; Wang, Eric; Chi, David H",Ann Otol Rhinol Laryngol,289,6

Therefore, a laboratory developed test (LDT) comprising a multiplexed RT-PCR protocol that detects and differentiates the four hCoV NL63, 229E, HKU1 and OC43 was adapted on the PF. The novel CE marked Aptima SARS-CoV-2 TMA and the LDT for hCoV were validated with 321 diagnostic specimens from the upper and lower respiratory tract in comparison to two SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCRs (PF E-gene RT-PCR and genesig RT-PCR, 157 specimens) or the R-GENE hCoV/hParaFlu RT-PCR (164 specimens), respectively. For the endemic hCoV, results were 96.3 % concordant with two specimens discordantly positive in the PF and four specimens discordantly positive in the R-GENE assay. All discordantly positive samples had Ct values between 33 and 39. The PF hCoV LDT identified 23 hCoV positive specimens as NL63, 15 as 229E, 15 as HKU1 and 25 as OC43. The Aptima SARS-CoV-2 TMA gave 99.4 % concordant results compared to the consensus results with a single specimen discordantly positive.

This is an extremely challenging task given the constraints in small-scale manufacturing for clinical trials, clinical testing timelines involving multiple phases and large-scale drug substance and drug product manufacturing. To tackle these challenges, regulatory processes are fast-tracked, and rapid-response manufacturing platform technologies are used. Here, we evaluate the current progress, challenges ahead and potential solutions for providing vaccines for pandemic response at an unprecedented scale and rate. Emerging rapid-response vaccine platform technologies, especially RNA platforms, offer a high productivity estimated at over 1 billion doses per year with a small manufacturing footprint and low capital cost facilities. The self-amplifying RNA (saRNA) drug product cost is estimated at below 1 USD/dose. These manufacturing processes and facilities can be decentralized to facilitate production, distribution, but also raw material supply. The RNA platform technology can be complemented by an a priori Quality by Design analysis aided by computational modeling in order to assure product quality and further speed up the regulatory approval processes when these platforms are used for epidemic or pandemic response in the future.","Kis, Zoltán; Kontoravdi, Cleo; Dey, Antu K.; Shattock, Robin; Shah, Nilay",J.

However, there is a lack of comprehensive study that investigates the relationships between multiple weather factors and the development of COVID-19 pandemic while excluding the impact of social factors. In this paper, we study the relationships between six main weather factors and the infection statistics of COVID-19 on 250 cities in Mainland China. Our correlation analysis using weather and infection statistics indicates that all the studied weather factors are correlated with the spread of COVID-19, where precipitation shows the strongest correlation. We also build a weather-aware predictive model that forecasts the number of infected cases should there be a second wave of the outbreak in Mainland China. Our predicted results show that cities located in different geographical areas are likely to be challenged with the second wave of COVID-19 at very different time periods and the severity of the outbreak varies to a large degree, in correspondence with the varying weather conditions.","Huang, Siyu; Liu, Ji; Xiong, Haoyi; Huang, Jizhou; An, Haozhe; Dou, Dejing",,289,24

Corn-fed, animal-derived proteins were more common in the diets of lower socioeconomic status populations than were plant-derived proteins, with individual estimates of animal-derived protein diets as high as 75%; United States towns and cities averaged 57%. Similar patterns were seen across the socioeconomic status spectrum in the Salt Lake Valley. It is likely that corn-fed animal proteins were associated with concentrated animal-feeding operations, a common practice for industrial animal production in the United States today. Given recent studies highlighting the negative impacts of animal-derived proteins in our diets, hair carbon isotope ratios could provide an approach for scaling assessments of animal-sourced foods and health risks in communities across the United States.","Ehleringer, James R; Covarrubias Avalos, Stephannie; Tipple, Brett J; Valenzuela, Luciano O; Cerling, Thure E",Proc.

This was accompanied by the suspension of all elective operations. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of the SARS-CoV­2 pandemic on general and visceral surgery in university hospitals in Germany. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was based on an anonymous survey, which was accessible online from 3 April 2020 to 17 April 2020 for the surgical departments of university hospitals in Germany. In total 73% (nâ¯= 29/40) of the hospitals participated in the survey. RESULTS: Cooperation with the authorities and the hospital administration was generally considered adequate; however, only 3% (1/29) and 7% (2/29) fully agreed with the statement that the health authorities at the federal and state level, respectively, were supportive of general and visceral surgery. The hospital directors expect an average loss of revenues of 28â¯± 16%. There was an average reduction in beds or operating room capacity of 38% and 45%, respectively. In addition, 11% of the medical personnel in general and visceral surgery were reallocated to other departments. CONCLUSION: The SARS-CoV­2 pandemic has a significant impact on academic general and visceral surgery in Germany. The reduction in beds and operating room capacity can lead to considerable delays in urgent surgical interventions and financial burdens in 2020 and subsequent years.","Stöß, Christian; Haffer, Henryk; Steffani, Marcella; Pergolini, Ilaria; Hartmann, Daniel; Nitsche, Ulrich; Novotny, Alexander; Friess, Helmut; Müller, Michael W",Chirurg,289,16

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Population-based longitudinal analysis of electronic health records from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink, linked to hospital admissions and the mortality registry (1998-2017). We included 100 722 adult patients without diabetes history, diagnosed with giant cell arteritis or polymyalgia rheumatica (n=32 593), inflammatory bowel disease (n=29 272), rheumatoid arthritis (n=28 365), vasculitis (n=6082), or systemic lupus erythematosus (n=4410). We estimated risks and HRs of type 2 diabetes associated with time-variant daily and total cumulative prednisolone-equivalent glucocorticoid dose using Cox regression methods. RESULTS: Average patient age was 58.6 years, 65 469 (65.0%) were women and 8858 (22.6%) had a body mass index (BMI) &#8805;30 kg/m2. Overall, 8137 (8.1%) people developed type 2 diabetes after a median follow-up of 4.9 years. At 1 year, the cumulative risk of diabetes increased from 0.9% during periods of non-use to 5.0% when the daily prednisolone-equivalent dose was &#8805;25.0 mg. We found strong dose-dependent associations for all immune-mediated diseases, BMI levels and underlying disease duration, even after controlling for periods of active systemic inflammation. Adjusted HR for a <5.0 mg daily dose versus non-use was 1.90, 95% CI 1.44 to 2.50; range 1.70 for rheumatoid arthritis to 2.93 for inflammatory bowel disease. CONCLUSIONS: We report dose-dependent risks of type 2 diabetes associated with glucocorticoid use for six common immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. These results underline the need for regular diabetic risk assessment and testing during glucocorticoid therapy in these patients.","Wu, Jianhua; Mackie, Sarah L; Pujades-Rodriguez, Mar",,289,13

Design and methods: In this exploratory study, we prospectively included adult patients (aged &#8805; 18 years) admitted between February 26 and April 30, 2020 to a tertiary care hospital in Switzerland. We assessed the association of an underlying SARS-CoV-2 infection and equilibrium serum levels of RAAS peptides in hospitalized COVID-19 patients 1:1 propensity-score matched with patients suffering from SARS-CoV-2-negative respiratory infections. Subgroup analyses involved stratification for taking RAAS inhibitors. Results: COVID-19 patients had about 50% lower equilibrium serum RAAS peptide levels as compared with matched controls (angiotensin I: 31.6 vs 66.8 pmol/L, -52.7% (95%CI: -68.5% to -36.9%); angiotensin II: 37.7 vs 92.5 pmol/L, -59.2% (95%CI: -72.1% to -46.3%); angiotensin (1-5): 3.3 vs 6.6 pmol/L, -49.7% (95%CI: -59.2% to -40.2%); angiotensin (1-7): 4.8 vs 7.6 pmol/L, -64.9% (95%CI: -84.5% to -45.3%)). While the plasma renin activity was lower in COVID-19 patients (88.6 vs 207.9 pmol/L, -58.5% (95%CI: -71.4% to -45.6%)), there was no difference of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and ACE2 plasma activity between the groups. Subgroup analyses revealed a pronounced RAAS peptide profile depression in COVID-19 patients among those not on RAAS inhibitors. Conclusions: As compared with SARS-CoV-2-negative patients, we found a downregulated RAAS in presence of a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Whether the lower levels of the protective angiotensin (1-5) and (1-7) are linked to adverse outcomes in COVID-19 warrants further investigation.","Kutz, Alexander; Conen, Anna; Gregoriano, Claudia; Haubitz, Sebastian; Koch, Daniel; Domenig, Oliver; Bernasconi, Luca; Mueller, Beat; Schuetz, Philipp",Eur J Endocrinol,289,22

The disease has rapidly spread from Wuhan to other regions. OBJECTIVES: To describe the clinical manifestations and epidemiological characteristics of patients with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in Hunan Province in 2020. STUDY DESIGN: From January 19 to February 7, 2020, 33 patients with positive in nucleic acid test of pharyngeal swab were retrospectively collected and analyzed. RESULTS: There are 33 COVID-19 patients (16 male, 17 female), and the median age was 46 years. Nineteen patients (48 %) were associated with a family cluster outbreak. Seventeen patients (52 %) had traveled or lived in Hubei Province. These patients are early mild cases, most common symptoms are fever [23 (70 %)] and cough [13 (39 %)]. Most patients' white blood cell counts are normal, while they manifest as significant reduction in lymphocytes [17/28 (61 %)]. The levels of c-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate suggest a typical viral infection. Procalcitonin did not increase and D-dimer increased slightly. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels have elevated in most patients. CT images of these patients showed bilateral multiple plaques or nodular ground-glass opacities (68.4 %). Fecal nucleic acid results were positive in eight COVID-19 patients accompanied with diarrhea. Tear nucleic acid results were negative in six COVID-19 patients. And four asymptomatic patients were infected with SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical symptoms, laboratory results and imaging reports of patients with COVID-19 in Hunan area are significantly different from those in Wuhan area. For non-Wuhan epidemic areas, more attention should be paid to nucleic acid test results of throat swabs and stools, and it is not easily to diagnose based on clinical symptoms and CT results. Reduced whole blood lymph count can be used as an adjuvant diagnosis of early SARS-CoV-2 infection. Attention should be paid to asymptomatic carriers, which is of great significance for the control of the global epidemic.","Yin, Sheng; Peng, Yizhi; Ren, Yaping; Hu, Min; Tang, Lingli; Xiang, Zhongyuan; Li, Xianping; Wang, Min; Wang, Wenlong",J Clin Virol,289,16

While the majority of transgender and gender diverse (TGD) youth are healthy, many experience suicidal thoughts and behavior (STB). Due to discrimination and stigma, TGD youth attempt suicide at higher rates then heterosexual, cisgender and even cisgender, LGBQ youth. Despite this vulnerability to suicide, few treatments have been developed and tested for this population. One treatment, attachment-based family therapy (ABFT) has been adapted to work with LGBQ youth and may be promising for TGD adolescents at risk for suicide. This article provides an overview of our ABFT modifications for TGD youth with thoughts of suicide. Specifically, we illustrate how treatment outcomes, in a single case study, relate to processes within clinical treatment tasks. The case study demonstrates the application of these ABFT modifications with a self-identified, gender nonconforming adolescent (who had recently attempted suicide) and his caregivers. Treatment evaluation measures were collected over the course of 24 weeks to illustrate the youth's clinical progress. The youth's suicidal symptoms diminished markedly by the end of treatment.

Accurate detection of infection with SARS-CoV-2 is an essential component of efforts to treat individual patients and to contain spread of the virus in the community. The purpose of this review is to describe current diagnostic modalities for SARS-CoV-2 and outline their use. Special considerations for pediatric age groups are included. RECENT FINDINGS: RNA PCR from the upper respiratory tract remains the gold standard for detection of infection with SARS-CoV-2. Antigen testing is being widely deployed as a faster and more convenient alternative to PCR, but is less sensitive and should only be used for diagnosis early after symptom onset. Serologic assays can document prior infection and are helpful in diagnosing multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. Serologic testing should not be used to diagnose acute or active infection. Immune assays are likely to provide a useful measure of protection against COVID19 in the future as knowledge of protective responses improves. SUMMARY: A variety of SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics have recently been developed and deployed. Clinicians should understand the appropriate use and interpretation of RNA PCR, antigen testing and immune assays for SARS-CoV-2 in order to diagnose and treat patients in this evolving pandemic.","Spearman, Paul",Curr. opin. pediatr,289,16

While influenza virus shows seasonality, it is unknown if COVID-19 has any weather-related affect. In this work, we analyze the patterns in local weather of all the regions affected by COVID-19 globally. Our results indicate that approximately 85% of the COVID-19 reported cases until 1 May 2020, making approximately 3 million reported cases (out of approximately 29 million tests performed) have occurred in regions with temperature between 3 and 17 °C and absolute humidity between 1 and 9 g/m3. Similarly, hot and humid regions outside these ranges have only reported around 15% or approximately 0.5 million cases (out of approximately 7 million tests performed). This suggests that weather might be playing a role in COVID-19 spread across the world. However, this role could be limited in US and European cities (above 45 N), as mean temperature and absolute humidity levels do not reach these ranges even during the peak summer months. For hot and humid countries, most of them have already been experiencing temperatures >35 °C and absolute humidity >9 g/m3 since the beginning of March, and therefore the effect of weather, however little it is, has already been accounted for in the COVID-19 spread in those regions, and they must take strict social distancing measures to stop the further spread of COVID-19. Our analysis showed that the effect of weather may have only resulted in comparatively slower spread of COVID-19, but not halted it. We found that cases in warm and humid countries have consistently increased, accounting for approximately 500,000 cases in regions with absolute humidity >9 g/m3, therefore effective public health interventions must be implemented to stop the spread of COVID-19. This also means that 'summer' would not alone stop the spread of COVID-19 in any part of the world.","Bukhari, Qasim; Massaro, Joseph M; D039,; Agostino, Ralph B; Khan, Sheraz",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),289,16

One course affected included the first-year, 4-week Respiratory System course which began on March 9. Methods: On the final day of the course, students were sent surveys which assessed how they adjusted academically and personally to the campus shutdown. Results: The response rate was 137/159 (86%). Students' learning adjustments took into account changes to spaces and daily routine, their cohabitants, need for accountability, new learning resources, and anxiety. Most students were concerned about public health, the economy, and health of family and loved ones; fewer were concerned about their professional futures, restrictions on personal freedoms, and own health. Most students adjusted personally by connecting more with family, entertainment and sleep, and studying less. While a large majority of students made changes to connecting with friends and physical activity, students did not adjust uniformly.","Slivkoff, Mark D; Johnson, Catherine; Tackett, Sean",Med Sci Educ,289,25

As a consequence nutritional requirements are not met, resulting in weight- and muscle loss, and malnutrition. The aim of the present study is to delineate nutritional complaints, the (course of the) nutritional status and risk of sarcopenia of COVID-19 patients, during hospitalisation and after discharge. METHODS: In this prospective observational study in 407 hospital admitted COVID-19 patients in four university and peripheral hospitals, data were collected during dietetic consultations. Presence of nutrition related complaints (decreased appetite, loss of smell, changed taste, loss of taste, chewing and swallowing problems, nausea, vomiting, feeling of being full, stool frequency and consistency, gastric retention, need for help with food intake due to weakness and shortness of breath and nutritional status (weight loss, BMI, risk of sarcopenia with SARC-F &#8805;4 points) before, during hospital stay and after discharge were, where possible, collected. RESULTS: Included patients were most men (69%), median age of 64.8 ± 12.4 years, 60% were admitted to ICU at any time point during hospitalisation with a median LOS of 15 days and an in-hospital mortality rate of 21%. The most commonly reported complaints were: decreased appetite (58%), feeling of being full (49%) and shortness of breath (43%). One in three patients experienced changed taste, loss of taste and/or loss of smell. Prior to hospital admission, 67% of the patients was overweight (BMI >25 kg/m2), 35% of the patients was characterised as malnourished, mainly caused by considerable weight loss. Serious acute weight loss (>5 kg) was showed in 22% of the patents during the hospital stay; most of these patients (85%) were admitted to the ICU at any point in time. A high risk of sarcopenia (SARC-F &#8805; 4 points) was scored in 73% of the patients during hospital admission. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, one in five hospital admitted COVID-19 patients suffered from serious acute weight loss and 73% had a high risk of sarcopenia. Moreover, almost all patients had one or more nutritional complaints. Of these complaints, decreased appetite, feeling of being full, shortness of breath and changed taste and loss of taste were the most predominant nutrition related complaints. These symptoms have serious repercussions on nutritional status. Although nutritional complaints persisted a long time after discharge, only a small group of patients received dietetic treatment after hospital discharge in recovery phase. Clinicians should consider the risks of acute malnutrition and sarcopenia in COVID-19 patients and investigate multidisciplinary treatment including dietetics during hospital stay and after discharge.","Wierdsma, Nicolette J; Kruizenga, Hinke M; Konings, Lotte Aml; Krebbers, Daphne; Jorissen, Jolein Rmc; Joosten, Marie-Helene I; van Aken, Loes H; Tan, Flora M; van Bodegraven, Ad A; Soeters, Maarten R; Weijs, Peter Jm",Clin Nutr ESPEN,289,24

As COVID-19 cases and deaths continue to increase in the USA, aging Black and Hispanic populations have emerged as especially at-risk for increased exposure to COVID-19 and susceptibility to severe health outcomes. The current review discusses the weathering hypothesis and the influence of social inequality on the identified health disparities. Recent Findings: Aging minoritized populations have endured structural and social inequality over the lifecourse. Consequently, these populations experience weathering, a process that results in physiological dysregulation due to stress associated with persistent disadvantage. Through weathering and continued inequity, aging minoritized populations have an increased risk of exposure and poor health outcomes from COVID-19. Summary: Current literature and available data suggests that aging minoritized persons experience high rates of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. The current review hypothesizes and supports that observed disparities are the result of inequalities that especially affect Black and Hispanic populations over the lifecourse. Future efforts to address these disparities should emphasize research that supports governments in identifying at-risk groups, providing accessible COVID-19-related information to those groups, and implementing policy that addresses the structural and social inequities that perpetuate current COVID-19 disparities.","Walubita, Tubanji; Beccia, Ariel; Boama-Nyarko, Esther; Goulding, Melissa; Herbert, Carly; Kloppenburg, Jessica; Mabry, Guadalupe; Masters, Grace; McCullers, Asli; Forrester, Sarah",Curr Epidemiol Rep,289,19

Although the focus of public health systems must lie on patients' care and treatment, SARS-COV­2 infection has also affected surgical trainees in their academic and professional development, causing significant disruption in all forms of their training. Methods: The aims of this study were firstly to assess the impact of SARS-CoV­2 on core surgical training, regarding operative, educational and academic skills, as well as the general effect on psychological status and well-being of surgical trainees at a tertiary center in Greece. All core surgical trainees (17) in the general surgery department at the University Hospital of Patras were invited to participate in a voluntary anonymous survey via printed questionnaires. Results: Junior trainees and senior surgical trainees performed or assisted in almost 50% fewer cases in the COVID era when compared with the period reported before the virus. As far as courses, conferences and exams attended by trainees are concerned, a significant reduction in numbers (six vs 35) before and after the start of COVID-19 pandemic was apparent. In all, 10 (62.5%) trainees felt that their confidence in the operating theatre had been negatively impacted by the pandemic, while four (25%) trainees felt significant stress levels as a result of the national lockdown. Conclusions: It is imperative for surgical educators to design and implement new alternative ways to assist surgical trainees in their education and also avoid their undertraining during the pandemic.","Vailas, Michail; Sotiropoulou, Maria; Mulita, Francesk; Drakos, Nikolaos; Ambalov, Elina; Maroulis, Ioannis",Eur Surg,289,14

Some of them contributed to social welfare services to assist Iranians. However, others engaged in improper activities, such as calling the COVID-19 pandemic a hoax, standing against the quarantine rules, questioning the scientific methods of preventing COVID-19, and offering incorrect strategies that affected prevention and treatment. Yet, clerics are powerful social assets in Iranian society who have the status to help minimize the spread and effects of pandemics upon Iranian people. As a result, their assistance and influence must be used to combat the COVID-19 crisis. This paper argues that clerics in Iran should motivate people to uphold and obey health norms in four ways: (1) health promotion and encouragement, (2) material and instrumental support, (3) spiritual support, and (4) the mobilization of people to combat the disease. Conversely, it highlights the negative roles of clerics, such as (1) opposing social restrictions and opposing the closure of religious places, (2) countering the scientific-hygienic principles appropriate to COVID-19 prevention, and (3) opposing vaccination.","Yoosefi Lebni, Javad; Ziapour, Arash; Mehedi, Nafiul; Irandoost, Seyed Fahim",,289,20

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate whether customizing of public service announcements (PSAs) providing health guidelines to match individuals' identities increases their compliance. METHODS: We conducted a within- and between-subjects, randomized controlled cross-sectional, web-based study in July 2020. Participants viewed two PSAs: one advocating wearing a mask in public settings and one advocating staying at home. The control PSA only provided information, and the treatment PSAs were designed to appeal to the identities held by individuals; that is, either a Christian identity or an economically motivated identity. Participants were asked about their identity and then provided a control PSA and treatment PSA matching their identity, in random order. The PSAs were of approximately 100 words. RESULTS: We recruited 300 social media users from Amazon Mechanical Turk in accordance with usual protocols to ensure data quality. In total, 8 failed the data quality checks, and the remaining 292 were included in the analysis. In the identity-based PSA, the source of the PSA was changed, and a phrase of approximately 12 words relevant to the individual's identity was inserted. A PSA tailored for Christians, when matched with a Christian identity, increased the likelihood of compliance by 12 percentage points. A PSA that focused on economic values, when shown to individuals who identified as economically motivated, increased the likelihood of compliance by 6 points. CONCLUSIONS: Using social media to deliver COVID-19 public health announcements customized to individuals' identities is a promising measure to increase compliance with public health guidelines.

METHODS: Remnant serum samples for routine bloodwork from 2,338 pediatric patients at UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh were assessed using the EUROIMMUN Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA IgG (EuroIGG) assay. Reactive cases with sufficient volume were also tested using 3 additional commercial assays. RESULTS: Eighty-five specimens were reactive according to the EuroIGG, yielding 3.64% (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.91%-4.48%) seropositivity, of which 73 specimens had sufficient remaining volume for confirmation by orthogonal testing. Overall, 19.18% (95% CI, 10.18%-28.18%) of samples were positive on a second and/or third orthogonal assay. This 80.82% false positivity rate is disproportionate to the expected false positivity rate of 50% given our pediatric population prevalence and assay performance. CONCLUSIONS: In pediatric populations, false-positive SARS-CoV-2 serology may be more common than assay and prevalence parameters would predict, and further studies are needed to establish the performance of SARS-CoV-2 serology in children.","Geisler, Daniel; Freeman, Megan Culler; Rapsinski, Glenn J; Wheeler, Sarah E",Am J Clin Pathol,289,22

The purpose of the study was to evaluate the association between initial dosing strategy of thromboprophylaxis in critically ill COVID-19 patients and the risk of death, thromboembolism, and bleeding. METHOD: In this retrospective study, all critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted to two intensive care units in March and April 2020 were eligible. Patients were categorized into three groups according to initial daily dose of thromboprophylaxis: low (2500-4500 IU tinzaparin or 2500-5000 IU dalteparin), medium (> 4500 IU but < 175 IU/kilogram, kg, of body weight tinzaparin or > 5000 IU but < 200 IU/kg of body weight dalteparin), and high dose (&#8805; 175 IU/kg of body weight tinzaparin or &#8805; 200 IU/kg of body weight dalteparin). Thromboprophylaxis dosage was based on local standardized recommendations, not on degree of critical illness or risk of thrombosis. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate hazard ratios with corresponding 95% confidence intervals of death within 28 days from ICU admission. Multivariable models were adjusted for sex, age, body mass index, Simplified Acute Physiology Score III, invasive respiratory support, and initial dosing strategy of thromboprophylaxis. RESULTS: A total of 152 patients were included: 67 received low-, 48 medium-, and 37 high-dose thromboprophylaxis. Baseline characteristics did not differ between groups. For patients who received high-dose prophylaxis, mortality was lower (13.5%) compared to those who received medium dose (25.0%) or low dose (38.8%), p = 0.02. The hazard ratio of death was 0.33 (95% confidence intervals 0.13-0.87) among those who received high dose, and 0.88 (95% confidence intervals 0.43-1.83) among those who received medium dose, as compared to those who received low-dose thromboprophylaxis. There were fewer thromboembolic events in the high (2.7%) vs medium (18.8%) and low-dose thromboprophylaxis (17.9%) groups, p = 0.04. CONCLUSIONS: Among critically ill COVID-19 patients with respiratory failure, high-dose thromboprophylaxis was associated with a lower risk of death and a lower cumulative incidence of thromboembolic events compared with lower doses.

This pandemic is caused by a novel virus, but the vulnerabilities that it reveals, including those produced by or associated with urban contexts, and the responses that we as local and global communities have mounted in the face of this crisis are not entirely new. This chapter draws on examples from the current pandemic and examines the urban-rural divide with respect to health that exists today, the actions people took during past pandemics in both urban and rural contexts to prevent the spread of disease, and ongoing international efforts to improve human health and well-being. Though much of the world’s attention is justifiably focused currently on the COVID-19 pandemic, there are important lessons to be learned about how crises, structural inequalities, and variations in health were produced by and affected past populations. The chapters in this volume amply demonstrate how much we can learn about these phenomena through bioarchaeological research in and near urban settings and how much work still remains to be done. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Roberts, C.

Governments are facing an urgent mandate to mobilize quickly and comprehensively in response, drawing not only on public resources and coordination capabilities but also on the cooperation and buy-in of civil society. Political and institutional legitimacy are crucial determinants of effective crisis management, and low-trust states lacking such legitimacy suffer a profound disadvantage. Social and economic crises attending the COVID-19 pandemic thus invite scholarly reflection about public attitudes, social leadership, and the role of social and institutional memory in the context of systemic disruption. This article examines Hong Kong as a case where failure to respond effectively could have been expected due to low levels of public trust and political legitimacy, but where, in fact, crisis response was unexpectedly successful. The case exposes underdevelopment in scholarly assumptions about the connections among political legitimacy, societal capacity, and crisis response capabilities. As such, this calls for a more nuanced understanding of how social behaviours and norms are structured and reproduced amidst existential uncertainties and policy ambiguities caused by sudden and convergent crises, and how these can themselves generate resources that bolster societal capacity in the fight against pandemics.","Hartley, Kris; Jarvis, Darryl S.

However, there has not yet been a review of the status of medical cannabis curriculum for medical and allied healthcare trainees worldwide, even though future healthcare workers will be placed on the forefront of patient care and must be prepared to counsel patients. This study was designed to address this gap in knowledge.DesignA search syntax was generated and databases PubMed, ERIC, CINAHL, and Web of Science were searched for relevant articles. A grey literature search of Google Scholar, MedEd, Medline, and the Proquest Dissertations and Theses section was also performed. All titles and abstracts were screened. Selected articles were subsequently screened using predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria.ResultsAllied healthcare trainees lacked sufficient knowledge about medical cannabis and did not feel prepared to counsel patients on this subject. Additionally, they expressed a growing interest in medical cannabis and would like more standardized education on the topic. Finally, faculty and deans in various institutions agreed on the need to educate students on the subject, and aimed to implement courses on medical cannabis or expand their existing curricula.ConclusionsWhile the medical cannabis landscape is developing, medical and allied health students are not properly educated and knowledgeable on this emerging field of clinical care. The findings suggest that the implementation of competencies-based curricula on medical cannabis is essential for medical and allied healthcare trainees to have the appropriate level of knowledge to counsel and educate their patients.","Zolotov, Yuval Metri Samer Calabria Emily Kogan Mikhail",Complementary Therapies in Medicine,289,17

Analysis of the cloned sequence revealed the presence of Walker A, Walker B and the ABC signature motifs at the nucleotide binding domains. Molecular docking resulted in predicting the most stable complex between the gene-encoding protein and cycloheximide. The southern blot results indicate that the gene is present as a single copy in the P. occitanis genome.

The variants associated with the H1a (GR) and H1b (GH) haplotypes were most prevalent, indicating a significant change in infection pattern with passage of time. The most important findings were that recombinant genomes and co-infection, respectively, were surmised in 44.7% and 12.9% of the samples extensively genotyped. Partners of many of the recombinations were relatively common strains. Co-existing viruses were among those currently circulating in Iran. In addition to random mutations, co-infection with different existing strains and recombination between their genomes may significantly contribute to the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 strains.","Taghizadeh, Peyman; Salehi, Sadegh; Heshmati, Ali; Houshmand, Seyed Massoud; InanlooRahatloo, Kolsoum; Mahjoubi, Forouzandeh; Sanati, Mohammad Hossein; Yari, Hadi; Alavi, Afagh; Jamehdar, Saeid Amel; Dabiri, Soroosh; Galehdari, Hamid; Haghshenas, Mohammad Reza; Hashemian, Amir Masoud; Heidarzadeh, Abtin; Jahanzad, Issa; Kheyrani, Elham; Piroozmand, Ahmad; Mojtahedi, Ali; Nikoo, Hadi Razavi; Rahimi Bidgoli, Mohammad Masoud; Rezvani, Nayebali; Sepehrnejad, Mehdi; Shakibzadeh, Arash; Shariati, Gholamreza; Seyyedi, Noorossadat; MohammadSaleh Zahraei, Seyed; Safari, Iman; Elahi, Elahe",Virology,289,30

This study investigates the socio-economic impact of the situation of the closed-loop system of solid waste recycling. Several recommendations for tackling this problem are presented in this research. Primary data collection for the waste bank and informal recycling sector was carried out in the eastern part of Surabaya during large-scale social restrictions. In-depth interviews were conducted with waste bank customers, waste bank unit representatives and the informal recycling sector to understand the pandemic's socio-economic impact on the closed-loop system. Results show that this pandemic has significant impacts on individuals and stakeholders engaged in waste recycling activities. Customers of waste banks, who mostly belong to low-income communities, mentioned that the waste bank closure gave rise to social and economic problems, such as increasing unmanaged solid waste and decreasing income. This result also applied to the informal recycling sector. The government can use the recommendations in this study to generate related policies, such as enforcing the health protocol within solid waste management to keep the recycling system in place and the business alive.","Warmadewanthi, Idaa; Wulandari, Dwi; Cahyadi, Mokhamad Nur; Pandebesie, Ellina Sitepu; Anityasari, Maria; Dwipayanti, Ni Made Utami; Purnama, I Gede Herry; Nisaa, Ainul Firdatun",Waste Manag Res,289,26

More recently, novel SARS-CoV-2 variants have been spreading around the world, and there is growing concern that they may have higher transmissibility and that the protective efficacy of vaccines may be weaker against them. Immediate measures are needed to reduce human exposure to the virus. In this study, the antiviral efficacy of deep-ultraviolet light-emitting diode (DUV-LED) irradiation (280 ± 5 nm, 3.75 mW/cm2) against three SARS-CoV-2 variants was evaluated. For the B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1 variant strains, irradiation of the virus stocks for 1 s resulted in infectious titer reduction rates of 96.3%, 94.6%, and 91.9%, respectively, and with irradiation for 5 s, the rates increased to 99.9%, 99.9%, and 99.8%, respectively. We also tested the effect of pulsed DUV-LED irradiation (7.5 mW/cm2, duty rate: 50%, frequency: 1 kHz) under the same output conditions as for continuous irradiation and found that the antiviral efficacy of pulsed and continuous irradiation was the same. These findings suggest that by further developing and optimizing the DUV-LED device to increase its output, it may be possible to instantly inactivate SARS-CoV-2 with DUV-LED irradiation.","Inagaki, Hiroko Saito Akatsuki Kaneko Chiho Sugiyama Hironobu Okabayashi Tamaki Fujimoto Shouichi",Pathogens,289,16

While socioeconomic factors were suggested to contribute to this trend, they arguably do not explain the range of the differences observed, allowing for possible genetic implications. Almost concurrently, the analysis of a cohort in Chinese COVID-19 patients proposed an association between the severity of the disease and the presence of the minor allele of rs12252 of the Interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) gene. This SNP, together with rs34481144, are the two most studied polymorphisms of IFITM3 and have been associated in the past with increased severity in Influenza, Dengue, Ebola, and HIV viruses. IFITM3 is an immune effector protein that is pivotal for the restriction of viral replication, but also for the regulation of cytokine production. Following up on these two developments in the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the present study investigates a possible association between the differences in mortality of ethnic groups in England and the combined haplotypes of rs12252 and rs34481144. The respective allele frequencies were collected for 26 populations from the 1000 Genomes Project and subgroups were pooled wherever possible to create correspondences with ethnic groups in England. A significant correlation (r = 0.9687, p = 0.0003) and a striking agreement was observed between the reported Standardized Mortality Ratios and the frequency of the combined haplotype of both reference alleles, suggesting that the combination of the reference alleles of the specific SNPs may be implicated in more severe outcomes of COVID-19. This study calls for further focus on the role of IFITM3 variants in the mechanism of cellular invasion of SARS-CoV-2, their impact in COVID-19 severity and their possible implications in vaccination efficacy.","Nikoloudis, Dimitris; Kountouras, Dimitrios; Hiona, Asimina",PeerJ,289,20

During the epidemic peak, in March 2020, patients needing intensive care unit treatments were approximately 10% of those infected. This fraction decreased to approximately 2% in the second part of April, and to 0.4% at the beginning of July. COVID-19 is characterized by several biochemical abnormalities whose discrepancy from normal values was associated to the severity of the disease. The aim of this retrospective study was to compare the biochemical patterns of patients during and after the pandemic peak in order to verify whether later patients were experiencing a milder COVID-19 course, as anecdotally observed by several clinicians of the same Hospital. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The laboratory findings of two equivalent groups of 84 patients each, admitted at the emergency department of the San Raffaele Hospital (Milan, Italy), during March and April respectively, were analyzed and compared. Results. White blood cell, platelets, lymphocytes and lactate dehydrogenase showed a statistically significant improvement (i.e. closer or within the normal clinical range) in the April group compared to March. Creatinine, C-reactive protein, Calcium and liver enzymes, were also pointing in that direction, although the differences were not significant. DISCUSSION: The laboratory findings analyzed in this study were consistent with a milder COVID-19 course in the April group. After excluding several hypotheses, we concluded that our observation was likely the consequence of the lockdown strategy enforcement, which, by imposing social distancing and the use of respiratory protective devices, reduced viral loads upon infection.","Ferrari, Davide; Carobene, Anna; Campagner, Andrea; Cabitza, Federico; Sabetta, Eleonora; Ceriotti, Daniele; Di Resta, Chiara; Locatelli, Massimo",Acta Biomed,289,16

METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included 160 patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to the National Center for Global Health and Medicine between January 26, 2020 and July 25, 2020. We searched PubMed for prognostic models for COVID-19. The predicted outcome was initiation of respiratory support or death. Performance of the candidate models was evaluated according to discrimination and calibration. We recalibrated the intercept of each model with our data. We also updated each model by adding ß2-microglobulin (ß2MG) to the model and recalculating the intercept and the coefficient of ß2MG. RESULTS: Mean patient age was 49.8 years, 68% were male, 88.7% were Japanese. The study outcomes occurred in 15 patients, including two deaths. Two-hundred sixty-nine papers were screened, and four candidate prognostic models were assessed. The model of Bartoletti et al. had the highest area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) (0.88; 95% confidence interval 0.81-0.96). All four models overestimated the probability of occurrence of the outcome. None of the four models showed statistically significant improvement in AUCs by adding ß2MG. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the existing prediction models for COVID-19 overestimate the probability of occurrence of unfavorable outcomes in a Japanese cohort. When applying a prediction model to a different cohort, it is desirable to evaluate its performance according to the prevalent health situation in that region.","Yamada, Gen; Hayakawa, Kayoko; Asai, Yusuke; Matsunaga, Nobuaki; Ohtsu, Hiroshi; Hojo, Masayuki; Hashimoto, Masao; Kobayashi, Kentaro; Sasaki, Ryo; Okamoto, Tatsuya; Yanagawa, Yasuaki; Katagiri, Daisuke; Terada, Mari; Suzuki, Michiyo; Sato, Lubna; Miyazato, Yusuke; Ishikane, Masahiro; Morioka, Shinichiro; Saito, Sho; Ohmagari, Norio",J Infect Chemother,289,14

While real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has performed as the main method for virus detection, other methods are becoming available, including transcription mediated amplification (TMA). The Hologic Aptima SARS-CoV-2 Assay utilizes TMA as a target amplification mechanism, and it has only recently received Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). OBJECTIVES: We sought to compare the sensitivity and specificity of the Aptima SARS-CoV-2 Assay to RTPCR as a means of SARS-CoV-2 detection in a diagnostic setting. STUDY DESIGN: We performed a limit-of-detection study (LoD) to assess the analytical sensitivity of TMA and RT-PCR. This preceded a comparison of the methods using previously evaluated clinical specimens (nasopharyngeal swabs) using 116 human specimens tested by both methodologies. Specimens included sixty-one (61) specimens found reactive by real-time PCR, fifty-one (51) found non-reactive, and four (4) deemed inconclusive. RESULTS: The Aptima SARS-CoV-2 Assay showed a markedly higher analytical sensitivity than RT-PCR by LoD study. Evaluation of clinical specimens resulted in fewer inconclusive results by the SARS-CoV-2 assay, leading to potentially higher clinical sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: Higher analytical sensitivity may explain TMA's ability to ascertain for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 genome in human specimens deemed inconclusive by real-time PCR. TMA provides an effective, highly sensitive means of detection of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal specimens.","Gorzalski, Andrew J; Tian, Honglin; Laverdure, Chris; Morzunov, Sergey; Verma, Subhash C; VanHooser, Stephanie; Pandori, Mark W",J Clin Virol,289,1

However, the therapeutic mechanism of the effect of HSBDF on COVID-19 remains unclear. METHODS: The components and action targets of HSBDF were searched in the TCMSP, YaTCM, PubChem, and TargetNet databases. Disease targets related to ACE2 were screened in single-cell sequence data of colon epithelial cells from other reports. The therapeutic targets of HSBDF for COVID-19 were obtained by integrated analysis, and the protein-protein interaction was analyzed using the STRING database. The Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) processes were analyzed using the OmicsBean and Metascape databases. The communication between networks [component-target (C-T) network, component-target-pathway (C-T-P) network, herb-target (H-T) network, target-pathway (T-P) network, and meridian-tropism (M-T) network] was constructed by Cytoscape software. The Cloud computing molecular docking platform was used to verify the molecular docking. RESULTS: The obtained 223 active ingredients and 358 targets of HSBDF. The 5,555 COVID-19 disease targets related to ACE2 were extracted, and 84 compound-disease common targets were found, of which the principal targets included ACE, ESR1, ADRA1A, and HDAC1. A total of 3,946 items were seized by GO enrichment analysis, mainly related to metabolism, protein binding, cellular response to the stimulus, and receptor activity. The enriched KEGG pathways screened 46 signaling pathways, including the renin-angiotensin system, the renin secretion, NF-kappa B pathway, the arachidonic acid metabolism, and the AMPK signaling pathway. The molecular docking results showed that the bioactive components of HSBDF have an excellent binding ability with main proteins related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

Influenza virus due to its wide host range and zoonotic potential poses such a significant threat to public health. Swine serve as a “mixing vessel” for influenza virus reassortment and evolution which as a result may facilitate the emergence of new strains or subtypes of zoonotic potential. In this context, the currently available scientific data hold a high significance to unravel influenza virus epidemiology and evolution. With this objective, the current systematic review summarizes the original research articles and case reports of all the four types of influenza viruses reported in swine populations worldwide. A total of 281 articles were found eligible through screening of PubMed and Google Scholar databases and hence were included in this systematic review. The highest number of research articles (n = 107) were reported from Asia, followed by Americas (n = 97), Europe (n = 55), Africa (n = 18), and Australia (n = 4). The H1N1, H1N2, H3N2, and A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were the most common influenza A virus subtypes reported in swine in most countries across the globe, however, few strains of influenza B, C, and D viruses were also reported in certain countries. Multiple reports of the avian influenza virus strains documented in the last two decades in swine in China, the United States, Canada, South Korea, Nigeria, and Egypt provided the evidence of interspecies transmission of influenza viruses from birds to swine. Interspecies transmission of equine influenza virus H3N8 from horse to swine in China expanded the genetic diversity of swine influenza viruses. Additionally, numerous reports of the double and triple-reassortant strains which emerged due to reassortments among avian, human, and swine strains within swine further increased the genetic diversity of swine influenza viruses. These findings are alarming hence active surveillance should be in place to prevent future influenza pandemics.","Chauhan, Ravendra P.; Gordon, Michelle L.",Pathogens,289,14

In this context, flow and image cytometry emerge as powerful technologies to investigate the mechanism of therapeutic candidates, as well as for the identification of the immune response and prognostics of disease severity. Data from the large randomized trials support the conclusion that CQ and HCQ do not provide any clinical improvements in disease severity and progression of SARS-CoV-2 patients, as well as they do not present any solid evidence of increased serious side effects.

это пандемия коронавирусной инфекции COVID-19 В результате пострадали многие отрасли мировой экономики, не стало исключением и международное судоходство Поскольку морские суда в процессе своей деятельности посещают иностранные порты, то «цепная реакция» их закрытия прибрежными государствами вызвала существенные проблемы как для судовладельцев, так и для людей, находящихся на борту (членов экипажа и пассажиров) Особенно тяжкие последствия настоящей «блокады» иностранных портов ощутили на себе пассажирские круизные суда, которым власти иностранных портов стали отказывать в заходе и высадке пассажиров В статье анализируется практика иностранных и российских портов в условиях пандемии, которая может в значительной степени отличаться даже в пределах одного прибрежного государства В одних морских портах введен относительно либеральный режим, предусматривающий, в частности, заблаговременную подачу судном дополнительной санитарно-эпидемиологической информации, осуществление бесконтактной термометрии членов экипажа и пассажиров, требование обязательного ношения медицинских масок и т п Другие порты вообще отказывают в заходе иностранным судам, в лучшем случае суда помещаются на карантин, а членам экипажа и пассажирам запрещено сходить на берег в течение инкубационного периода, длящегося около двух недель Автор отмечает, что большинство российских портов в период пандемии коронавируса COVID-19 ограничились введением бесконтактной термометрии членов экипажа и пассажиров и/или соблюдения масочного режима В целях обоснования правомерности предпринимаемых прибрежными государствами ограничительных мер исследуются концепция свободы доступа судов в иностранные порты и право вынужденного захода Правовой режим морских портов как составной части внутренних морских вод прибрежного государства определяется его законодательством, однако с учетом норм международного права Каждое государство вправе самостоятельно принимать решение об открытии тех или иных своих портов для захода иностранных судов Вместе с тем современная практика свидетельствует о том, что в интересах развития экономики и поддержания торговых связей прибрежные государства держат свои порты открытыми для международного судоходства Концепция свободы доступа судов в иностранные порты получила достаточно широкое отражение как в доктрине международного права, представленной трудами видных отечественных и зарубежных ученых, так и в национальном законодательстве По мнению автора, принятые портовыми властями в период пандемии ограничительные меры являются оправданными с точки зрения санитарно-эпидемиологической защиты населения Если государство вводит режим самоизоляции в отношении собственных граждан, то, видимо, аналогичные меры будут правомерными и для иностранных граждан, прибывающих в порты на морских судах Концепция свободы доступа морских судов в иностранные порты вовсе не означает, что прибрежное государство не может объявлять некоторые свои порты закрытыми для международного судоходства Вместе с тем такое закрытие портов должно быть мотивированным, заблаговременно доведенным до заинтересованных лиц, юридически обоснованным и осуществляться на недискриминационной основе Важное практическое значение имеет вывод, что иностранномусудну, имеющему на борту больных коронавирусной инфекцией COVID-19 и осуществляющему вынужденный заход в порт, не может быть отказано в таком праве Причем необходимость вынужденного захода не обязательно должна быть обусловлена наличием на борту больных коронавирусом, которым требуется срочная медицинская помощь, которую невозможно оказать в судовых условиях Речь может идти о вынужденном заходе в связи с отсутствием продовольствия, воды, топлива и т п В заключение приводятся основные выводы по статье","Gutsulyak, V.",State and Law,289,16

Therefore, it is essential to evaluate the overall magnitude and direction of the grazing effects on soils. This global meta-analysis was conducted using the mixed model method to address the overall effects of grazing intensities (heavy, moderate, and light) on 15 soil properties based on 287 papers published globally from 2007 to 2019. Our findings showed that heavy grazing significantly increased the soil BD (11.3% relative un-grazing) and PR (52.5%) and reduced SOC (-10.8%), WC (-10.8%), NO3- (-23.5%), and MBC (-27.9%) at 0-10 cm depth, and reduced SOC (-22.5%) and TN (-19.9%) at 10-30 cm depth. Moderate grazing significantly increased the BD (7.5%), PR (46.0%), and P (18.9%) (0-10 cm), and increased pH (4.1%) and decreased SOC (-16.4%), TN (-10.6%), and P (-23.9%) (10-30 cm). Light grazing significantly increased the SOC (10.8%) and NH4+ (28.7%) (0-10 cm). Heavy grazing showed much higher mean probability (0.70) leading to overgrazing than the moderate (0.14) and light (0.10) grazing. These findings indicate that, globally, compared to un-grazing, heavy grazing significantly increased soil compaction and reduced SOC, NO3-, and soil moisture. Moderate grazing significantly increased soil compaction and alkalinity and reduced SOC and TN. Light grazing significantly increased SOC and NH4+. Cattle grazing impacts on soil compaction, SOC, TN, and available K were higher than sheep grazing, but lower for PR. Climate significantly impacted grazing effects on SOM, TN, available P, NH4+, EC, CEC, and PR. Heavy grazing can be more detrimental to soil quality based on BD, SOC, TN, C: N, WC, and K than moderate and light grazing. However, global grazing intensities did not significantly impact most of the 15 soil properties, and the grazing effects on them had insignificant changes over the years.","Lai, Liming; Kumar, Sandeep",PLoS One,289,24

We assess the efficacy of the cordon sanitaire to delay the introduction and onset of local transmission of COVID-19 in other major cities in mainland China. METHODS: We estimated the number of infected travellers from Wuhan to other major cities in mainland China from November 2019 to February 2020 using previously estimated COVID-19 prevalence in Wuhan and publicly available mobility data. We focused on Beijing, Chongqing, Hangzhou, and Shenzhen as four representative major cities to identify the potential independent contribution of the cordon sanitaire and holiday travel. To do this, we simulated outbreaks generated by infected arrivals in these destination cities using stochastic branching processes. We also modelled the effect of the cordon sanitaire in combination with reduced transmissibility scenarios to simulate the effect of local non-pharmaceutical interventions. RESULTS: We find that in the four cities, given the potentially high prevalence of COVID-19 in Wuhan between December 2019 and early January 2020, local transmission may have been seeded as early as 1-8 January 2020. By the time the cordon sanitaire was imposed, infections were likely in the thousands. The cordon sanitaire alone did not substantially affect the epidemic progression in these cities, although it may have had some effect in smaller cities. Reduced transmissibility resulted in a notable decrease in the incidence of infection in the four studied cities. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that sustained transmission was likely occurring several weeks prior to the implementation of the cordon sanitaire in four major cities of mainland China and that the observed decrease in incidence was likely attributable to other non-pharmaceutical, transmission-reducing interventions.","Quilty, Billy J; Diamond, Charlie; Liu, Yang; Gibbs, Hamish; Russell, Timothy W; Jarvis, Christopher I; Prem, Kiesha; Pearson, Carl A B; Clifford, Samuel; Flasche, Stefan; Klepac, Petra; Eggo, Rosalind M; Jit, Mark",BMC Med,289,16

However, the best methods still fail in many real-world fitness scenarios, suggesting that there is a domain gap between current datasets and real-world fitness data. To enable the field to address fitness-specific vision problems, we created InfiniteForm, an open-source synthetic dataset of 60k images with diverse fitness poses (15 categories), both single- and multi-person scenes, and realistic variation in lighting, camera angles, and occlusions. As a synthetic dataset, InfiniteForm offers minimal bias in body shape and skin tone, and provides pixel-perfect labels for standard annotations like 2D keypoints, as well as those that are difficult or impossible for humans to produce like depth and occlusion. In addition, we introduce a novel generative procedure for creating diverse synthetic poses from predefined exercise categories. This generative process can be extended to any application where pose diversity is needed to train robust computer vision models.","Weitz, Andrew; Colucci, Lina; Primas, Sidney; Bent, Brinnae",,289,24

We report on the development and implementation of an internet-based COVID-19 participatory surveillance tool in rural Appalachia. METHODS: A regional collaboration among public health partners culminated in the design and implementation of the COVID-19 Self-Checker, a local online symptom tracker. The tool collected data on participant demographic characteristics and health history. County residents were then invited to take part in an automated daily electronic follow-up to monitor symptom progression, assess barriers to care and testing, and collect data on COVID-19 test results and symptom resolution. RESULTS: Nearly 6500 county residents visited and 1755 residents completed the COVID-19 Self-Checker from April 30 through June 9, 2020. Of the 579 residents who reported severe or mild COVID-19 symptoms, COVID-19 symptoms were primarily reported among women (n = 408, 70.5%), adults with preexisting health conditions (n = 246, 70.5%), adults aged 18-44 (n = 301, 52.0%), and users who reported not having a health care provider (n = 131, 22.6%). Initial findings showed underrepresentation of some racial/ethnic and non-English-speaking groups. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: This low-cost internet-based platform provided a flexible means to collect participatory surveillance data on local changes in COVID-19 symptoms and adapt to guidance. Data from this tool can be used to monitor the efficacy of public health response measures at the local level in rural Appalachia.","Runkle, Jennifer D; Sugg, Maggie M; Graham, Garrett; Hodge, Bryan; March, Terri; Mullendore, Jennifer; Tove, Fletcher; Salyers, Martha; Valeika, Steve; Vaughan, Ellis",Public Health Rep,289,24

Unconditional quantile regressions indicate that lower levels of financial wellbeing are present across the entire distribution, except at the very top. Distribution analyses indicate that the labour market shocks are also associated with higher levels of inequality in financial wellbeing.

Targeting the interaction between S1 and ACE2 is a practical strategy against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Herein, we show encouraging results indicating that human cathelicidin LL37 can simultaneously block viral S1 and cloak ACE2. LL37 binds to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S1 with high affinity (11.2 nM) and decreases subsequent recruitment of ACE2. Owing to the RBD blockade, LL37 inhibits SARS-CoV-2 S pseudovirion infection, with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration of 4.74 µg/mL. Interestingly, LL37 also binds to ACE2 with an affinity of 25.5 nM and cloaks the ligand-binding domain (LBD), thereby decreasing S1 adherence and protecting cells against pseudovirion infection in vitro.

To make matters worse, an upcoming and alarming trend that is increasingly being noticed as a post-COVID sequel is that of pulmonary fibrosis. Given the scale of the pandemic, the magnitude of this problem is likely to be high. Extrapolated conclusions from previous studies discussing the beneficial role of antifibrotics in progressive fibrosing interstitial lung diseases provide some hope that these medicines might have a potentially useful role in COVID-19 related lung fibrosis as well. Increased serum levels of inflammatory and pro-fibrotic mediators in COVID-19 patients, similar cytokine profiles in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and COVID-19, and broad anti-fibrotic activity of approved antifibrotics irrespective of the underlying etiology, are some of the proposed mechanisms favoring the argument. However, no studies currently support or refute the use of antifibrotics in patients developing post-COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis. In view of such uncertainties, it is critically important for lung fibrosis networks to conduct well-designed prospective clinical trials addressing this issue to find conclusive answers.","Mishra, Mayank; Sindhwani, Girish",Adv Respir Med,289,16

These viruses spread mainly via the droplet route. However, during the pandemic of COVID-19 other reservoirs, i.e., water (surface and ground), sewage, garbage, or soil, should be considered. As the infectious SARS-CoV-2 particles are also present in human excretions, such a non-droplet transmission is also possible. A significant problem is the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the hospital environment, including patients' rooms, medical equipment, everyday objects and the air. Relevant is selecting the type of equipment in the COVID-19 hospital wards on which the virus particles persist the shortest or do not remain infectious. Elimination of plastic objects/equipment from the environment of the infected person seems to be of great importance. It is particularly relevant in water reservoirs contaminated with raw discharges. Wastewater may contain coronaviruses and therefore there is a need for expanding Water-Based Epidemiology (WBE) studies to use obtained values as tool in determination of the actual percentage of the SARS-CoV-2 infected population in an area. It is of great importance to evaluate the available disinfection methods to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the environment. Exposure of SARS-CoV-2 to 65-70% ethanol, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, or 0.1% sodium hypochlorite has effectively eliminated the virus from the surfaces. Since there are many unanswered questions about the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the research on this topic is still ongoing. This review aims to summarize current knowledge on the SARS-CoV-2 transmission and elucidate the viral survival in the environment, with particular emphasis on the possibility of non-droplet transmission.","Wiktorczyk-Kapischke, Natalia; Grudlewska-Buda, Katarzyna; Walecka-Zacharska, Ewa; Kwiecinska-Piróg, Joanna; Radtke, Laura; Gospodarek-Komkowska, Eugenia; Skowron, Krzysztof",Sci Total Environ,289,20

The paper highlights the importance of policies and the surrounding circumstances when it comes to negotiating pedagogical beliefs. This paper challenges the long-established assumption that age and much experience make it difficult for teachers to adapt their face-to-face educational activities to online platforms. We argue that institutional policies play a crucial role in shaping and reshaping teachers' assumptions and practices when the following conditions are met: sound IT infrastructure, technological support, and continuous training.","Alhawsawi, Sajjadllah Jawhar Sabria Salama",Heliyon,289,29

In vitro models of surface-attached biofilms do not always accurately mimic these processes. Here, we tested a new approach to create in vitro non-attached bacterial aggregates using the principle of magnetic levitation of biological objects placed into a magnetic field gradient. Bacteria grown under magnetic levitation conditions formed non-attached aggregates that were studied with CLSM and SEM and characterized quantitatively. Non-attached aggregates consisted of bacteria submerged into an extracellular matrix and demonstrated features characteristic of biofilms, such as polymeric matrix that binds Ruby Red and Congo red dyes, prerequisite of bacterial growth, and increased resistance to gentamicin. Three quantitative methods were explored to characterize strain-specific potential to form non-attached aggregates: geometric sizes, relative quantities of aggregated and free-swimming bacteria, and Congo red binding. A comparison of three E. coli strains demonstrated that the strain weakly forming non-attached aggregates differed from strains that formed aggregates based on all three parameters (p<0.05). Further, we characterized biofilm formation on plastic and agar surfaces by these strains and found that good biofilm formation ability does not necessarily indicate good non-attached aggregate formation ability, and vice versa. The model and quantitative methods can be applied for in vitro studies of non-attached aggregates and modeling bacterial behavior in chronic infections, as it is important to increase understanding of the role that non-attached bacterial aggregates play in the pathogenesis of chronic diseases.Importance paragraphAn increasing amount of evidence indicates that chronic infections are associated with non-attached biofilm-like aggregates formed by pathogenic bacteria. These aggregates differ from biofilms because they form under low-shear conditions within the volume of biological fluids and they do not attach to surfaces. Here, we describe an in vitro model that provides non-attached aggregate formation within the liquid volume due to magnetic levitation. Using this model, we demonstrated that despite morphological and functional similarities of non-attached aggregates and biofilms, strains that exhibit good biofilm formation might exhibit poor non-attached aggregate formation, suggesting that mechanisms underlying the formation of biofilms and non-attached aggregates are not identical. The magnetic levitation approach can be useful for in vitro studies of non-attached aggregate formation and simulation of bacterial behavior in chronic infections.","Domnin, Pavel; Arkhipova, Anastasiya; Petrov, Stanislav; Sysolyatina, Elena; Parfenov, Vladislav; Karalkin, Pavel; Mukhachev, Andrey; Gusarov, Alexey; Moisenovich, Mikhail; Khesuani, Yusef; Ermolaeva, Svetlana",,289,16

Due to the hand&#39;s complex structures located in a small area, surgeons must evaluate constantly the balance of inadequate surgery against functional and cosmetic aspects. Thus, a multidisciplinary approach is recommended for a correct diagnosis and treatment design. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 2006 and 2017, 354 consecutive patients with basal and squamous cell carcinomas, and melanoma of the hand were retrospectively analysed at the Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery at the University of Palermo, treatment was surgical for all of them; also radio- and chemotherapy were necessary based on the histological diagnosis. RESULTS: The most common tumour was basal cell carcinoma (BCCs), followed by squamous cell carcinoma (SCCs). Melanoma was the most frequent lesion diagnosed in the digits. Radical excision was the main treatment of choice. In 29 cases (11 with SCC, 18 with melanoma) axillary lymphadenectomy was performed, because of lymph nodes metastases. In the follow up, the spread of cancer to distant organs caused the death in three cases. Recurrence rate was higher in case of infiltrative SCCs and BCCs. CONCLUSIONS: The major references provide only limited information on malignant soft-tissue tumours of the hand. Our retrospective study aims to present the most commonly observed malignant soft-tissue tumours of the hand, analysing their causes, their objective and instrumental evaluation, and their treatments.","Tripoli, M; Franza, M; Cordova, A",Acta Chir Plast,289,16

This mimicry may pose a challenge, as the management of both diseases is quite different. Furthermore, the temporal association of initiating treatment affects prognosis. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) mainly infects the pulmonary system. However, in a patient with concomitant pulmonary tuberculosis, it can be a diagnostic challenge. CASE REPORT A 28-year-old man of Indian origin presented with headache and vomiting. He had a brain mass on imaging suggestive of a glioma. He also had lung infiltrates and was diagnosed with a co-infection by SARS-CoV-2, by a reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using the GeneXpert system. The mass was excised and was found to be a tuberculoma, diagnosed by Xpert MTB. He received first-line anti-TB and treatment for COVID-19 pneumonia based on local guidelines. CONCLUSIONS This report highlights that COVID-19 can co-exist with other infectious diseases, such as TB. A high degree of clinical suspicion is required to detect TB with atypical presentation. A co-infection of pulmonary and CNS TB with COVID-19 can present a diagnostic challenge, and appropriate patient management relies on an accurate and rapid diagnosis. Surgery may be necessary if there are compressive signs and symptoms secondary to CNS TB. A diagnosis of COVID-19 should not delay urgent surgeries. Further studies are needed to understand the effects of COVID-19 on the clinical course of TB.","Ata, Fateen; Yousaf, Qudsum; Veliyankodan Parambil, Jessiya; Parengal, Jabeed; Mohamedali, Mohamed G; Yousaf, Zohaib",Am J Case Rep,289,26

Modern high-throughput sequencing technology has led to the deposition of vast numbers of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences in curated repositories, which have been useful in mapping the spread of the virus around the globe. They also provide a unique opportunity to observe virus evolution in real time. Here, we evaluate two sets of SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences to identify emerging variants within structured cis-regulatory elements of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Overall, 20 variants are present at a minor allele frequency of at least 0.5%. Several enhance the stability of Stem Loop 1 in the 5ʹ untranslated region (UTR), including a group of co-occurring variants that extend its length. One appears to modulate the stability of the frameshifting pseudoknot between ORF1a and ORF1b, and another perturbs a bi-ss molecular switch in the 3ʹUTR. Finally, 5 variants destabilize structured elements within the 3ʹUTR hypervariable region, including the S2M (stem loop 2 m) selfish genetic element, raising questions as to the functional relevance of these structures in viral replication. Two of the most abundant variants appear to be caused by RNA editing, suggesting host-viral defense contributes to SARS-CoV-2 genome heterogeneity. Our analysis has implications for the development of therapeutics that target viral cis-regulatory RNA structures or sequences.

AIM: To understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on migrants and their access to primary healthcare, and implications for COVID-19 vaccine roll out. DESIGN AND SETTING: Primary care professionals, administrative staff, and migrants (foreign born; >18 years; <10 years in UK), were recruited in three phases using purposive, convenience and snowball sampling from urban, suburban and rural settings. METHODS: In-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted by telephone. Data were analysed iteratively, informed by thematic analysis. RESULTS: 64 clinicians were recruited in Phase 1 (25 GPs, 15 nurses, 7 HCAs, 1 Pharmacist); Phase 2 comprised 16 administrative staff; and Phase 3, 17 migrants (88% asylum seekers; 65% female; mean time in UK 4 years). Digitalisation has amplified existing inequalities in access to healthcare for many migrants due to lack of digital literacy and access to technology, compounded by language barriers and challenges building trust. Participants highlighted challenges registering and accessing healthcare due to physical closure of surgeries. Migrants reported specific beliefs around COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccines, from acceptance to mistrust, often influenced by misinformation. Innovative opportunities suggested included translated digital health advice using text templates and YouTube.

MAIN TEXT: This commentary describes current challenges in preventing social isolation among older adults and proposes pathways to develop inclusive approaches to intervention in this vulnerable population. Building interventions that take account of structural inequities among older persons, as well as their subjective experiences, expectations and perspectives, appears fundamental to improve their health and quality of life in pandemic and post-pandemic contexts.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A combined prospective and retrospective, multicentre, cohort study was conducted at 10 sites in Austria in 247 people with diabetes or newly diagnosed prediabetes who were hospitalized with COVID-19. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality and the predictor variables upon admission included clinical data, co-morbidities of diabetes or laboratory data. Logistic regression analyses were performed to identify significant predictors and to develop a risk score for in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: The mean age of people hospitalized (n = 238) for COVID-19 was 71.1 ± 12.9 years, 63.6% were males, 75.6% had type 2 diabetes, 4.6% had type 1 diabetes and 19.8% had prediabetes. The mean duration of hospital stay was 18 ± 16 days, 23.9% required ventilation therapy and 24.4% died in the hospital. The mortality rate in people with diabetes was numerically higher (26.7%) compared with those with prediabetes (14.9%) but without statistical significance (P = .128). A score including age, arterial occlusive disease, C-reactive protein, estimated glomerular filtration rate and aspartate aminotransferase levels at admission predicted in-hospital mortality with a C-statistic of 0.889 (95% CI: 0.837-0.941) and calibration of 1.000 (P = .909). CONCLUSIONS: The in-hospital mortality for COVID-19 was high in people with diabetes but not significantly different to the risk in people with prediabetes. A risk score using five routinely available patient variables showed excellent predictive performance for assessing in-hospital mortality.","Sourij, Harald; Aziz, Faisal; Bräuer, Alexander; Ciardi, Christian; Clodi, Martin; Fasching, Peter; Karolyi, Mario; Kautzky-Willer, Alexandra; Klammer, Carmen; Malle, Oliver; Oulhaj, Abderrahim; Pawelka, Erich; Peric, Slobodan; Ress, Claudia; Sourij, Caren; Stechemesser, Lars; Stingl, Harald; Stulnig, Thomas; Tripolt, Norbert; Wagner, Michael; Wolf, Peter; Zitterl, Andreas; Kaser, Susanne",Diabetes obes. metab,289,22

APPROACH AND RESULTS: This was a territory-wide retrospective cohort study in Hong Kong. Patients with COVID-19 between January 23, 2020, and January 1, 2021, were identified. Patients with hepatitis C or no HBsAg results were excluded. The primary outcome was mortality. Acute liver injury was defined as alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase &#8805;2 × upper limit of normal (ULN; i.e., 80 U/L), with total bilirubin &#8805;2 × ULN (i.e., 2.2 mg/dL) and/or international normalized ratio &#8805;1.7. Of 5,639 patients included, 353 (6.3%) and 359 (6.4%) had current and past HBV infection, respectively. Compared to patients without known HBV exposure, current HBV-infected patients were older and more likely to have cirrhosis. Past HBV-infected patients were the oldest, and more had diabetes and cardiovascular disease. At a median follow-up of 14 (9-20) days, 138 (2.4%) patients died; acute liver injury occurred in 58 (1.2%), 8 (2.3%), and 11 (3.1%) patients with no, current, and past HBV infection, respectively. Acute liver injury (adjusted HR [aHR], 2.45; 95% CI, 1.52-3.96; P < 0.001), but not current (aHR, 1.29; 95% CI, 0.61-2.70; P = 0.507) or past (aHR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.56-1.46; P = 0.681) HBV infection, was associated with mortality.

Methods: A total of 108 COVID-19-positive medical staff patients were included in the study from March 23, 2020 to June 15, 2020. Patients were analyzed for demographic data, clinical presentations, and in-hospital outcomes and compared against 661 COVID-19-infected patients of non-medical personel. Results: Mean age of medical staff patients was 44.05±13.9 years, most of whom were women (63.9%). The infected medical staff members consisted of 63 nurses (58.3%), 37 physicians (34.3%), 5 technicians (4.6%), and 3 pharmacists (2.8%). Smoking (60.2%) was the most frequent, followed by diabetes mellitus (37%). Of 108 COVID-19 infected medical staff, 18 (16.6%) were isolated in the intensive care unit (ICU), of which 14 (77.8%) were male, 16 (88.9%) were smokers, and 16 (88.9%) presented with pneumonia.

OBJECTIVE: Using a patient-centered approach, we explored the experiences and needs of people living with dementia and their care partners during the COVID-19 pandemic as part of an ongoing evaluation of dementia support services in British Columbia, Canada. METHODS: A survey instrument was developed around the priorities identified in the context of the COVID-19 and Dementia Task Force convened by the Alzheimer Society of Canada. RESULTS: A total of 417 surveys were analyzed. Overall, respondents were able to access information that was helpful for maintaining their own health and managing a period of social distancing. Care partners reported a number of serious concerns, including the inability to visit the person that they care for in long-term or palliative care. Participants also reported that the pandemic increased their levels of stress overall and that they felt lonelier and more isolated than they did before the pandemic. The use of technology was reported as a way to connect socially with their loved ones, with the majority of participants connecting with others at least twice per week. CONCLUSION: Looking at the complex effects of a global pandemic through the experiences of people living with dementia and their care partners is vital to inform healthcare priorities to restore their quality of life and health and better prepare for the future.","Tam, Mallorie T; Dosso, Jill A; Robillard, Julie M",J Alzheimers Dis,289,20

We aim to change the drug shortage management strategy from a reactive process to a more proactive approach using predictive data analytics. By doing so, we can drive our decision-making to more efficiently manage drug shortages. METHODS: Internal purchasing, formulary, and drug shortage data were reviewed to identify drugs subject to a high shortage risk (""shortage drugs"") or not subject to a high shortage risk (""nonshortage drugs""). Potential candidate predictors of drug shortage risk were collected from previous literature. The dataset was trained and tested using 2 methods, including k-fold cross-validation and a 70/30 partition into a training dataset and a testing dataset, respectively. RESULTS: A total of 1,517 shortage and nonshortage drugs were included. The following candidate predictors were used to build the dataset: dosage form, therapeutic class, controlled substance schedule (Schedule II or Schedules III-V), orphan drug status, generic versus branded status, and number of manufacturers. Predictors that positively predicted shortages included classification of drugs as intravenous-only, both oral and intravenous, antimicrobials, analgesics, electrolytes, anesthetics, and cardiovascular agents. Predictors that negatively predicted a shortage included classification as an oral-only agent, branded-only agent, antipsychotic, Schedule II agent, or orphan drug, as well as the total number of manufacturers. The calculated sensitivity was 0.71; the specificity, 0.93; the accuracy, 0.87; and the C statistic, 0.93.

However, the existence, unique phenotype and function of so-called tissue Tregs in the heart remain unclear. Methods: In mouse models of myocardial infarction (MI), myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury (I/R injury) or cardiac cryoinjury, the dynamic accumulation of Tregs in the injured myocardium was monitored. The bulk RNA-sequencing was performed to analyze the transcriptomic characteristics of Tregs from the injured myocardium after MI or I/R injury. Photoconversion, parabiosis, single-cell TCR sequencing and adoptive transfer were applied to determine the source of heart Tregs. The involvement of the interleukin (IL)-33/ST2 axis and secreted acidic cysteine rich glycoprotein (Sparc), a molecule upregulated in heart Tregs, was further evaluated in functional assays. Results: We showed that Tregs were highly enriched in the myocardium of MI, I/R injury and cryoinjury mice. Transcriptomic data revealed that Tregs isolated from the injured hearts had plenty of differentially expressed transcripts compared to their lymphoid counterparts including heart draining lymphoid nodes, with a phenotype of promoting infarct repair, indicating a unique characteristic. The heart Tregs were accumulated mainly due to recruitment from circulating Treg pool, while local proliferation also contributed to their expansion. Moreover, a remarkable case of repeatedly detected TCR of heart Tregs, more than that of spleen Tregs, suggests a model of clonal expansion. Besides, HelioshighNrp-1high phenotype proved the mainly thymic origin of heart Tregs, with a small contribution of phenotypic conversion of conventional CD4+ T cells (Tconvs), proved by the analysis of TCR repertoires and Tconvs adoptive transfer experiments. Notably, the IL-33/ST2 axis was essential for sustaining heart Treg populations. Finally, we demonstrated that Sparc, which was highly expressed by heart Tregs, acted as a critical factor to protect the heart against MI by increasing collagen content and boosting maturation in the infarct zone. Conclusions: We identified and characterized a phenotypically and functionally unique population of heart Tregs, which may lay the foundation to harness Tregs for cardioprotection in MI and other cardiac diseases.","Xia, Ni; Lu, Yuzhi; Gu, Muyang; Li, Nana; Liu, Meilin; Jiao, Jiao; Zhu, Zhengfeng; Li, Jingyong; Li, Dan; Tang, Tingting; Lv, Bingjie; Nie, Shaofang; Zhang, Min; Liao, Mengyang; Liao, Yuhua; Yang, Xiangping; Cheng, Xiang",Circulation,289,1

METHODS: Our data stem from an adult cohort created to prospectively investigate the relationship between diet and morbidity and mortality from chronic non-communicable diseases in Brazil. For this study, we selected the first participants (n = 10,116) who answered twice to a simplified questionnaire on their diet the day before, the first time when entering the study, between January 26 and February 15, 2020, and the second between May 10 and 19, 2020. The questionnaire inquiries about the consumption of healthy (vegetables, fruits and legumes) and unhealthy (ultra-processed foods) eating markers. Comparisons of indicators based on the consumption of these markers before and during the pandemic are presented for the study population and according to gender, age group, macro-region of residence and schooling. Chi-square tests and t-tests were used to compare proportions and means, respectively, adopting p < 0.05 to identify significant differences. RESULTS: For all participants, we found a modest but statistically significant increase in the consumption of healthy eating markers and stability in the consumption of unhealthy food markers. This favorable pattern of dietary changes during the pandemic occurred in most sociodemographic strata. We observed a less favorable changing pattern, with a tendency to increasing consumption of healthy and unhealthy food markers, in the Northeast and North macro-regions and among people with less schooling, suggesting social inequalities in the response to the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: If confirmed, the trend of increased consumption of ultra-processed foods in underdeveloped regions and by people with less schooling is concerning, as eating these foods increases the risk of obesity, hypertension and diabetes, whose presence increases the severity and lethality of covid-19.","Steele, Eurídice Martínez; Rauber, Fernanda; Costa, Caroline Dos Santos; Leite, Maria Alvim; Gabe, Kamila Tiemann; Louzada, Maria Laura da Costa; Levy, Renata Bertazzi; Monteiro, Carlos Augusto",Rev Saude Publica,289,16

ObjectiveWe aim to predict mental disorder (anxiety and depression) symptoms of managers across countries using country-level COVID-19 statistics. MethodsA two-wave online survey of 406 managers from 26 countries was finished in May and July 2020. We used logistic panel regression models for our main analyses and performed robustness checks using ordinary least squares regressions. In the sample of 406 managers from 26 countries, 26.5% of managers reached the cut-off levels for anxiety (General Anxiety Disorder-7; GAD-7) and 43.5% did so for depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9; PHQ-9) symptoms. FindingsWe found that cumulative COVID-19 statistics (e.g., cumulative cases, cumulative cases per million, cumulative deaths, and cumulative deaths per million) predicted managers anxiety and depression symptoms positively, whereas daily COVID-19 statistics (daily new cases, smoothed daily new cases, daily new deaths, smoothed daily new deaths, daily new cases per million, and smoothed daily new cases per million) predicted anxiety and depression symptoms negatively. In addition, the reproduction rate was a positive predictor, while stringency of governmental lockdown measures was a negative predictor. Individually, we found that the cumulative count of deaths is the best single predictor of both anxiety and depression symptoms. ConclusionsCumulative COVID-19 statistics predicted managers anxiety and depression symptoms positively, while non-cumulative daily COVID-19 statistics predicted anxiety and depression symptoms negatively. Cumulative count of deaths is the best single predictor of both anxiety and depression symptoms. Reproduction rate was a positive predictor, while stringency of governmental lockdown measures was a negative predictor.","Li, Lun; Zhang, Stephen X.; Graf-Vlachy, Lorenz",,289,12

MethodsWe assess viral acceleration using a novel indicator introduced in Baunez et al. (2021). The acceleration index relates the percentage change of tests that have been performed on a given day to the percentage change in the associated positive cases that same day. We compare viral acceleration among vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals in France over the period May 31st - August 29, 2021. ResultsOnce the state of the epidemic within each groups is accounted for, it turns out that viral acceleration has since mid-July converged to similar levels among vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals in France, even though viral speed is larger for the latter group compared to the former. ConclusionOur results call for an increasing testing effort for both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, in view of the fact that viral circulation is currently accelerating at similar levels for both groups in France.

When admitting patients to the hospital, it is desirable to isolate patients with COVID-19 from those without the disease. However, reliably identifying patients with COVID-19 in the emergency department before hospital admission is often limited by the speed and availability of testing. Previous studies determined a low lymphocyte count is commonly found in patients with COVID-19. We sought to explore the sensitivity of absolute lymphocyte count in patients presenting to the emergency department requiring subsequent hospitalization who were found to have COVID-19. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed on 312 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to the hospital from the emergency department. The absolute lymphocyte count for these patients was used to calculate sensitivities at various cut-off values. The relationships between absolute lymphocyte count and variables, including age, sex, need for intubation, and mortality, were also explored. RESULTS: Cut-off values for absolute lymphocyte count ranged from 1.1 K/uL to 2.0 K/uL, with sensitivities of 72% and 94%, respectively. Additionally, lower mean absolute lymphocyte counts were identified in males, patients who required intubation, and patients who died. CONCLUSION: Knowing the sensitivity of absolute lymphocyte count in patients with COVID-19 may help identify patients who are unlikely to have the disease. Additionally, absolute lymphocyte count can be used as a marker of disease severity in patients with COVID-19.","Illg, Zachary; Muller, Gregory; Mueller, Matthew; Nippert, Justin; Allen, Brian",Am J Emerg Med,289,16

In this study, we attempted to explain the clinical and laboratories characteristics of non-surviving patients, to identify the probable factors affecting disease progression. METHODS: In a retrospective study, we assessed the data from dead adult patients who were hospitalized and laboratory diagnosed with COVID-19 during March 2020. The data were obtained from electronic medical records. Moreover, a checklist including demographic, clinical, laboratorial, imaging, and treatment data was completed for each one of the patients. In case of lack of information, a member of the research team contacted the first-degree relatives via phone. RESULTS: Totally, 50 patients were enrolled in this study. The mean age was 68.0 ± 14.1 years. Of them, 29 (58%) patients were male. Notably, the median (IQR) hospitalization time was 4.0 (2.7-6.2) days and the duration between the first symptoms to death was 10.0 (5.0-14.5) days. Also, pre-existing morbidity was reported in 42 (84%) patients, and hypertension was the most common one with 28 (54%) patients. Interestingly, body temperature more than 37.5°C was reported in only 20 (40%) patients. Nevertheless, neutrophilia (&#8805;7109/L) and lymphopenia (<1.0 109/L) were observed in 27 (54%) and 29 (58%) patients, respectively. Also, elevated levels of creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and C-reactive protein (CRP) were common, which may be indicators of aggravation of the patients' status. CONCLUSION: Besides age and underlying diseases, elevated creatinine level, neutrophil count, and the inflammatory indices along with the reduced lymphocyte count can be considered as indicators of disease progression. Hence, they should be considered for admission and surveillance of patients.","Hormati, Ahmad; Foroghi Ghomi, Seyed Yaser; Sohrabi, Masoudreza; Jafari, Saeedeh; Jabbari, Amir; Aminnejad, Reza; Afifian, Mahboubeh; RakhshanKhah, Elham; Ahmadpour, Sajjad",Arch Iran Med,289,22

However, physical distancing between clinicians and patients with spine-related symptoms is not solely limited to restrictions imposed by pandemic-related lockdowns. In most low- and middle-income countries, as well as many underserved marginalized communities in high-income countries, there is little to no access to clinicians trained in evidence-based care for people experiencing spinal pain. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to describe the development and present the components of evidence-based patient and clinician guides for the management of spinal disorders where in-person care is not available. METHODS: Ultimately, two sets of guides were developed (one for patients and one for clinicians) by extracting information from the published Global Spine Care Initiative (GSCI) papers. An international, interprofessional team of 29 participants from 10 countries on 4 continents participated. The team included practitioners in family medicine, neurology, physiatry, rheumatology, psychology, chiropractic, physical therapy, and yoga, as well as epidemiologists, research methodologists, and laypeople. The participants were invited to review, edit, and comment on the guides in an open iterative consensus process. RESULTS: The Patient Guide is a simple 2-step process. The first step describes the nature of the symptoms or concerns. The second step provides information that a patient can use when considering self-care, determining whether to contact a clinician, or considering seeking emergency care. The Clinician Guide is a 5-step process: (1) Obtain and document patient demographics, location of primary clinical symptoms, and psychosocial information. (2) Review the symptoms noted in the patient guide. (3) Determine the GSCI classification of the patient's spine-related complaints. (4) Ask additional questions to determine the GSCI subclassification of the symptom pattern. (5) Consider appropriate treatment interventions. CONCLUSIONS: The Patient and Clinician Guides are designed to be sufficiently clear to be useful to all patients and clinicians, irrespective of their location, education, professional qualifications, and experience. However, they are comprehensive enough to provide guidance on the management of all spine-related symptoms or disorders, including triage for serious and specific diseases. They are consistent with widely accepted evidence-based clinical practice guidelines. They also allow for adequate documentation and medical record keeping. These guides should be of value during periods of government-mandated physical or social distancing due to infectious diseases, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic. They should also be of value in underserved communities in high-, middle-, and low-income countries where there is a dearth of accessible trained spine care clinicians. These guides have the potential to reduce the overutilization of unnecessary and expensive interventions while empowering patients to self-manage uncomplicated spinal pain with the assistance of their clinician, either through direct in-person consultation or via telehealth communication.","Haldeman, Scott; Nordin, Margareta; Tavares, Patricia; Mullerpatan, Rajani; Kopansky-Giles, Deborah; Setlhare, Vincent; Chou, Roger; Hurwitz, Eric; Treanor, Caroline; Hartvigsen, Jan; Schneider, Michael; Gay, Ralph; Moss, Jean; Haldeman, Joan; Gryfe, David; Wilkey, Adam; Brown, Richard; Outerbridge, Geoff; Eberspaecher, Stefan; Carroll, Linda; Engelbrecht, Reginald; Graham, Kait; Cashion, Nathan; Ince, Stefanie; Moon, Erin",JMIR Public Health Surveill,289,20

In this work we propose an AI-powered pipeline, based on the deep-learning paradigm, for automated COVID-19 detection and lesion categorization from CT scans. We first propose a new segmentation module aimed at identifying automatically lung parenchyma and lobes. Next, we combined such segmentation network with classification networks for COVID-19 identification and lesion categorization. We compare the obtained classification results with those obtained by three expert radiologists on a dataset consisting of 162 CT scans. Results showed a sensitivity of 90\% and a specificity of 93.5% for COVID-19 detection, outperforming those yielded by the expert radiologists, and an average lesion categorization accuracy of over 84%. Results also show that a significant role is played by prior lung and lobe segmentation that allowed us to enhance performance by over 20 percent points. The interpretation of the trained AI models, moreover, reveals that the most significant areas for supporting the decision on COVID-19 identification are consistent with the lesions clinically associated to the virus, i.e., crazy paving, consolidation and ground glass. This means that the artificial models are able to discriminate a positive patient from a negative one (both controls and patients with interstitial pneumonia tested negative to COVID) by evaluating the presence of those lesions into CT scans. Finally, the AI models are integrated into a user-friendly GUI to support AI explainability for radiologists, which is publicly available at http://perceivelab.com/covid-ai.","Pennisi, Matteo; Kavasidis, Isaak; Spampinato, Concetto; Schinina, Vincenzo; Palazzo, Simone; Rundo, Francesco; Cristofaro, Massimo; Campioni, Paolo; Pianura, Elisa; Stefano, Federica Di; Petrone, Ada; Albarello, Fabrizio; Ippolito, Giuseppe; Cuzzocrea, Salvatore; Conoci, Sabrina",,289,16

A strong response was induced in monocytes and B cells, with a SARS-CoV2-specific inflammatory gene cluster distinct from that seen in influenza-A or Ebola virus-infected co-cultures, and which reproduced deviations reported in blood or lung myeloid cells from COVID-19 patients. A substantial fraction of the effect could be reproduced after individual transfection of several SARS-CoV2 proteins (Spike and some non-structural proteins), mediated by soluble factors, but not via transcriptional induction. This response was greatly muted in monocytes from healthy children, perhaps a clue to the age-dependency of COVID-19.

However, poor interlayer network formation can limit a VP-printed part's tensile strength along the build axis. We demonstrate that the incorporation of carbamate bonds capable of undergoing dissociative exchange reactions provides improved interlayer network formation in VP-printed urethane acrylate polymers. In the presence of dibutyltin dilaurate catalyst, the exchange of these carbamate bonds enables rapid stress relaxation with an activation energy of 133 kJ/mol, consistent with a dissociative bond exchange process. Annealed XY tensile samples containing a catalyst demonstrate a 25% decrease in Young's modulus, attributed to statistical changes in network topology, while samples without a catalyst show no observable effect. Annealed ZX tensile samples printed with layers perpendicular to tensile load demonstrate an increase in elongation at break, indicative of self-healing. The strain at break for samples containing a catalyst increases from 33.9 to 56.0% after annealing but decreases from 48.1 to 32.1% after annealing in samples without a catalyst. This thermally activated bond exchange process improves the performance of VP-printed materials via self-healing across layers and provides a means to change Young's modulus after printing. Thus, the incorporation of carbamate bonds and appropriate catalysts in the VP-printing process provides a robust platform for enhancing material properties and performance.","Hamachi, Leslie S; Rau, Daniel A; Arrington, Clay B; Sheppard, Daylan T; Fortman, David J; Long, Timothy E; Williams, Christopher B; Dichtel, William R",ACS appl. mater. interfaces (Online),289,20

COVID-19 is a novel viral disease causing worldwide pandemia. The aim of this study was to describe the effect of adjunctive individualized homeopathic treatment delivered to hospitalized patients with confirmed symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. PATIENT PRESENTATION: Thirteen patients with COVID-19 were admitted. Mean age was 73.4 ± 15.0 (SD) years. Twelve (92.3%) were speedily discharged without relevant sequelae after 14.4 ± 8.9 days. A single patient admitted in an advanced stage of septic disease died in hospital. A time-dependent improvement of relevant clinical symptoms was observed in the 12 surviving patients. Six (46.2%) were critically ill and treated in the intensive care unit (ICU). Mean stay at the ICU of the 5 surviving patients was 18.8 ± 6.8 days. In six patients (46.2%) gastrointestinal disorders accompanied COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The observations suggest that adjunctive homeopathic treatment may be helpful to treat patients with confirmed COVID-19 even in high - risk patients especially since there is no conventional treatment of COVID-19 available at present.,"Takacs, Michael; Frass, Michael; Walder, Gernot; Fibert, Philippa; Rottensteiner, Maria; Glück, Walter; Lechleitner, Peter; Oberbaum, Menachem; Leisser, Ilse; Chandak, Kavita; Panhofer, Peter; Weiermayer, Petra",Complement Ther Clin Pract,289,29

In this randomized clinical trial, the efficacy and safety of IFN ß-1a were evaluated in patients with severe COVID-19. Forty-two patients in the interferon group received IFN ß-1a in addition to the national protocol medications (hydroxychloroquine plus lopinavir-ritonavir or atazanavir-ritonavir). Each 44-µg/ml (12 million IU/ml) dose of interferon ß-1a was subcutaneously injected three times weekly for two consecutive weeks. The control group consisted of 39 patients who received only the national protocol medications. The primary outcome of the study was time to reach clinical response. Secondary outcomes were duration of hospital stay, length of intensive care unit stay, 28-day mortality, effect of early or late administration of IFN on mortality, adverse effects, and complications during the hospitalization. Between 29 February and 3 April 2020, 92 patients were recruited, and a total of 42 patients in the IFN group and 39 patients in the control group completed the study. As the primary outcome, time to the clinical response was not significantly different between the IFN and the control groups (9.7 ± 5.8 versus 8.3 ± 4.9 days, respectively, P = 0.95). On day 14, 66.7% versus 43.6% of patients in the IFN group and the control group, respectively, were discharged (odds ratio [OR], 2.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.05 to 6.37). The 28-day overall mortality was significantly lower in the IFN than the control group (19% versus 43.6%, respectively, P = 0.015). Early administration significantly reduced mortality (OR, 13.5; 95% CI, 1.5 to 118). Although IFN did not change the time to reach the clinical response, adding it to the national protocol significantly increased discharge rate on day 14 and decreased 28-day mortality.

The general public construed the pandemic threat as being 'far away' and associated it with foreign practices and behaviours. Social media discourse was initially replete with indifference about the perceived risk. Conflicting views about the possibility of the pandemic spreading to Africa and the complexity of explaining its causes delayed the desired understanding of the reality of the global public health concern. The popular public response to the COVID-19 control discourse is therefore characterised by ambivalence about embracing the pandemic control protocols. Drawing on content and discourse analysis of musical and poetic compositions on COVID-19 by artists in East Africa and shared among WhatsApp users in Kenya, this article describes local perspectives on COVID-19 risk and their health promotion implications. It explores local construction of the meaning of the COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences for effective health promotion. The article considers the spontaneous musical and poetic performances by experienced and amateur artists as local attempts to enhance compliance with the global COVID-19 control protocols and popular participation in local health promotion. The basic premise is that artists' creation and sharing of digital COVID-19 lyrics denote their attempt to go beyond the medical logic of health promotion by including broad aspects of a cultural logic of care. This approach would establish an integrated and sustainable health promotion framework to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and its impact on local societal wellbeing.","Mulemi, Benson A",Glob Health Promot,289,16

The objective of this study is to examine this change and draw useful conclusions. Methods: We collected data retrospectively of all patients who attended outpatient clinics and who were operated at our institute under the department of neurosurgery from October 23, 2019, to August 23, 2020. These data were then divided into two groups (pre-COVID period and during the COVID pandemic) and compared. Results: Out of the 388 surgeries performed, 284 surgeries were performed during the pre-COVID period, and 104 surgeries were performed during the COVID pandemic. During this ongoing COVID pandemic, the total number of surgeries performed by the department of neurosurgery decreased significantly by 63.38%, the proportion of routine surgeries performed decreased from 50.35% to 19.23% and the proportion of minor cases increased from 19.72% to 30.77%. The Outpatient Clinic Workflow decreased by 72.3% as compared to the pre-COVID period, and the perioperative COVID-19 reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction positive incidence in our neurosurgical patients was 11.71%.

The seriousness of the disease has led many healthcare professionals plagued by stigma as well as discrimination. In this study, depressive symptomatology, levels of anxiety, and related psychosocial and occupational factors experienced by healthcare professionals in Sri Lanka during COVID -19 were investigated. METHODS: A total of 512 healthcare professionals were surveyed using an online survey. The Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale, the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale-Revised-10, and psychosocial and occupational factors predictive of depression and anxiety were included in the survey questionnaire. Logistic regression determined the factors associated with the presence of depressive symptoms and anxiety. RESULTS: Results showed that elevated depressive symptoms and anxiety were experienced by 53.3% and 51.3%, respectively, of the participants. No differences in the prevalence of elevated depressive symptoms and anxiety were found between those who were exposed and non-exposed to COVID-19 confirmed or suspected patients. Having a fear of being infected with COVID-19 and spreading it among family members were associated with increased risk of depression. Among those exposed to COVID-19 confirmed or suspected patients, poor occupational safety (OR = 2.06, 95% CI 1.25-3.39), stigmatization (OR = 2.19, 95% CI 1.29-3.72), and heavy workload (OR = 2.45, 95% CI 1.53-3.92) were associated with increased risk of elevated depressive symptoms, whilst poor self-confidence (OR = 2.53, 95% CI 1.56-4.09) and heavy workload (OR = 1.94. 95% CI 1.22-3.12) were associated with increased risk of anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: Fear of being infected and distress caused by fear of spreading it among family members, stigmatization, poor self-confidence, poor occupational safety and heavy workload are vital risk factors that need to be considered in future psychological support services designed for the healthcare professionals in unprecedented outbreaks like COVID-19.","Perera, Bilesha; Wickramarachchi, Bimba; Samanmalie, Champika; Hettiarachchi, Manjula",BMC Psychol,289,24

These disruptions signi_cantly impact the consumer demands, which in turn a_ect the capacity and pro_tability of a supply chain network. Economic survivability is the ability to maintain a net positive economic worth, or at least keeping it above a certain threshold, in the presence of sudden and prolonged disruptions that drastically reduce the product demands, prices, resource availability or others. We address the economic survivability of geographically distributed interconnected networks under demand disruptions. We formulate and incorporate the necessary conditions for ensuring economic survivability in supply chain design. The overall problem is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP). Increasing the economic survivability in general also increases the return-on-investment (ROI) and profitability. However, for multi-regional, distributed and interdependent supply chains, a more balanced distribution of investment portfolio is important to improve the local survivability of each region, but it comes at the expense of overall or global profitability. We also observe that the economic survivability is negatively impacted by over-designing a supply chain to meet excess demands (typically from spot markets). Decision-makers should balance the trade-offs between survivability and excess demand satisfaction by thoroughly assessing the probability of positive and negative demand uctuations.","Tsolas, Spyridon D.; Hasan, M.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective cross-sectional analysis of all visits by adults to the department during the Spanish state of emergency. The findings were compared to those for a similar period before the pandemic. We collected data for care variables, triage levels, wait times before triage, triage times, and times to first contact with a physician, discharge diagnostic codes, revisits within 72 hours, among other information. We also analyzed demand for timesensitive emergencies. RESULTS: Demand for emergency department care decreased overall by 48.3% (95% CI, 0.48%-0.49%) while the state of emergency was in effect. The decrease was 60.7% (95% CI, 0.60%-0.61%) during phase 0 (lockdown). The decrease was more marked for the lower priority emergencies during lockdown (phase 0), at 60.5% for the lowest (level V) versus 35.1% for the highest priority (level I). The most frequent diagnoses were for respiratory conditions, followed by abdominal pain. There was a decrease in demand for treatment for all time-sensitive conditions.

Evidence implies that individuals’ levels of death anxiety, anxiety sensitivity, and difficulties in emotion regulation may contribute to their peritraumatic stress symptomatology in the aftermath of trauma exposure. OBJECTIVE: The current study aimed to explore these hypotheses in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: An online survey was conducted among a convenience sample of 846 Israeli adults from April 2 to 19 April 2020. COVID-19-related stressors, death anxiety, anxiety sensitivity, difficulties in emotion regulation, and peritraumatic stress symptoms were assessed via self-report questionnaires. RESULTS: Analyses indicated significant relations between death anxiety, anxiety sensitivity, and emotion regulation difficulties, on the one hand, and peritraumatic stress symptoms, on the other. Three distinct profiles were identified. Furthermore, profile type – namely having low, medium, and high levels of death anxiety, anxiety sensitivity, and emotion dysregulation – had a significant effect in explaining peritraumatic stress symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that during the pandemic, levels of death anxiety, anxiety sensitivity, and emotion dysregulation may explain heterogeneity in individuals’ trauma-related symptomatology.","Siegel, Alana; Mor, Inbar; Lahav, Yael",European journal of psychotraumatology,289,24

On 2 March 2020, the Moroccan Ministry of Health confirmed the first COVID-19 case in Morocco. The new virus SARS-CoV-2 was identified in the sample of a Moroccan expatriate residing in Italy. Without a therapeutic vaccine or specific antiviral drugs, early detection and isolation become essential against novel Coronavirus. This study aims to analyze the epidemiological profile of the SARS-CoV-2 in Moroccan cases and to investigate the dynamic of RdRp gene, N gene, and E gene in patients from diagnosis until the recovery. Among 859 Covid-19 RT-PCR tests realized for 285 patients, 133 cases had positive results Covid-19. 9 % of these cases present the 3 genes RdRp, N, and E, 47% only the RdRp gene, 2% with RdRp and N gene, 26% cases are positives with N gene, and 16 % with N and E gene. The analysis of the Covid-19 genes (RdRp, N, and E) dynamic reveal that more than 6% stay positive with detection of the N and E gene, and 14% with the N gene after 12 days of treatment. The median period from positive to the first negative Covid-19 RT-PCR tests was 6.8{+/-}2.24 days for 44% cases, 14.31 {+/-} 2.4 days for 30%, and 22.67 {+/-} 1.21 days for 4%.

We assessed temporal changes and geographical differences in risk perceptions and precautionary behaviors in response to H1N1 influenza. METHODS: 1,290 US adults completed an online survey on risk perceptions, interests in pharmaceutical interventions (preventive intervention and curative intervention), and engagement in precautionary activities (information seeking activities and taking quarantine measures) in response to H1N1 influenza between April 28 and May 27 2009. Associations of risk perceptions and precautionary behaviors with respondents' sex, age, and household size were analyzed. Linear and quadratic time trends were assessed by regression analyses. Geographic differences in risk perception and precautionary behaviors were evaluated. Predictors of willingness to take pharmaceutical intervention were analyzed. RESULTS: Respondents from larger households reported stronger interest in taking medications and engaged in more precautionary activities, as would be normatively predicted. Perceived risk increased over time, whereas interest in pharmaceutical preventive interventions and the engagement in some precautionary activities decreased over time. Respondents who live in states with higher H1N1 incidence per population perceived a higher likelihood of influenza infection, but did not express greater interests in pharmaceutical interventions, nor did they engage in a higher degree of precautionary activities. Perceived likelihood of influenza infection, willingness to take medications and engagement in information seeking activities were higher for women than men. CONCLUSIONS: Perceived risk of infection and precautionary behavior can be dynamic in time, and differ by demographic characteristics and geographical locations. These patterns will likely influence the effectiveness of disease control measures.","Ibuka, Yoko; Chapman, Gretchen B; Meyers, Lauren A; Li, Meng; Galvani, Alison P",BMC Infect Dis,289,16

Data on subclinical infections are even totally absent, although asymptomatic persons might act as a source of respiratory infections. METHODS: In a 1-year community-based study, we prospectively investigated the possible virologic cause of acute respiratory infections in 107 symptomatic case episodes and 91 symptom-free control periods. Participants, persons ⩾60 years, reported daily the presence of respiratory symptoms in a diary. Virologic assessment was performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and serology. RESULTS: In 58% of the case episodes a pathogen was demonstrated, the most common being rhinoviruses (32%), coronaviruses (17%), and influenzaviruses (7%). The odds ratio for demonstrating a virus in cases with symptoms vs. controls without symptoms was 30.0 (95% confidence interval 10.2–87.6). In 4% of the symptom-free control periods a virus was detected. CONCLUSION: This study supports the importance of rhinovirus infections in community-dwelling elderly persons, whereas asymptomatic elderly persons can also harbor pathogens as detected by PCR, and thus might be a source of infection for their environment.","Graat, Judith M; Schouten, Evert G; Heijnen, Marie-Louise A; Kok, Frans J; Pallast, Esther G.M; de Greeff, Sabine C; Dorigo-Zetsma, J.Wendelien",J Clin Epidemiol,289,9

Recent developments in disease-modifying therapies provide hope that therapy may become available soon. The high disease prevalence and complex evaluation process will create challenges for the healthcare system already burdened by the current pandemic. This study examined the preparedness of the South Korean healthcare system to identify and treat patients when such a therapy becomes available. METHODS: We used a Markov model to simulate a stylized patient’s journey. Based on national data and expert input, we presented projections of the diagnosis and treatment wait times and respective queues of patients under treatment and no-treatment scenarios and further simulated the possible option of adopting a blood-based biomarker test. RESULTS: Under the current system, we estimated a peak waiting time of 14 months when a treatment became available, largely because of the limited number of dementia specialists. Adopting a blood-based biomarker test dramatically reduced the initial wait times by more than half. A disease-modifying therapy was estimated to avert 575,000 incident cases in the first 10 years after the treatment entered the market, and a blood-based test further avoided 86,000 additional cases. CONCLUSION: South Korea’s healthcare infrastructure requires more preparation for the introduction of a disease-modifying therapy, with the primary capacity limitation being the low number of dementia specialists. The utilization of a blood-based test for Alzheimer’s disease biomarkers may be an effective solution.","Jun, Hankyung; Cho, Sang Kyu; Yoong, Joanne; Mattke, Soeren",Ann Geriatr Med Res,289,1

A total of 80,389 cases, hospitalized from 2017 to 2019 at a tertiary care hospital (University of Leipzig Medical Center (ULMC)) and two primary care hospitals (Muldentalkliniken (MTL)) in Germany, were enrolled. AKI was defined and staged according to the Kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines. Clinical and laboratory data was automatically collected from electronic patient records using the frameworks of the CDSS. In our cohort, we found an overall AKI incidence proportion of 12.1%. We identified 6,393/1,703/1,604 cases as AKI stage 1/2/3 (8.0%/2.1%/2.0%, respectively). Administrative coding with N17 (ICD-10-GM) was missing in 55.8% of all AKI cases with the potential for additional diagnosis related groups (DRG) reimbursement of 1,204,200  in our study. AKI was associated with higher hospital mortality, increased length of hospitalisation and more frequent need of renal replacement therapy. A total of 19.1% of AKI cases (n = 1,848) showed progression to higher AKI stages (progressive AKI) during hospitalization. These cases presented with considerably longer hospitalization, higher rates of renal replacement therapy and increased mortality (p<0.001, respectively). Furthermore, progressive AKI was significantly associated with sepsis, shock, liver cirrhosis, myocardial infarction, and cardiac insufficiency. AKI, and especially its progression during hospitalization, is strongly associated with adverse outcomes.

India is the fourth most COVID-19 affected country at present (as on July 10, 2020). With limited medical facilities and high transmission rate, study of COVID-19 progression and its subsequence trajectory need to be analyzed in India. Epidemiologic mathematical models have the potential to predict the epidemic peak of COVID-19 under different scenario. Lockdown is one of the most effective mitigation policy adapted worldwide to control the transmission rate of COVID-19 cases. In this study, we use an improvised five compartment mathematical model i.e. Susceptible (S) - exposed (E)- infected (I)- recovered (R)- death (D) (SEIRD) to investigate the progression of COVID-19 and predict the epidemic peak under the impact of lockdown in India. The aim of this study to provide the most accurate prediction of epidemic peak and to evaluate the impact of lockdown on epidemic peak shift in India. For this purpose, we examine most recent data (up to July 10, 2020) to enhance the accuracy of outcomes from the proposed model. The obtained results indicate that COVID-19 epidemic peak would appear on around mid-August 2020 in India and corresponding estimated cases would be 2.5X10^6 under current scenario. In addition, our study indicates that existence of under-reported cases (~10^5) during post-lockdown period in India. It is expected that nationwide lockdown would lead to epidemic peak suppression in India.

To help alleviate this strain, we have designed and tested the accessible low-barrier in vivo-validated economical ventilator (ALIVE Vent), a COVID-19-inspired, cost-effective, open-source, in vivo-validated solution made from commercially available components. The ALIVE Vent operates using compressed oxygen and air to drive inspiration, while two solenoid valves ensure one-way flow and precise cycle timing. The device was functionally tested and profiled using a variable resistance and compliance artificial lung and validated in anesthetized large animals. Our functional test results revealed its effective operation under a wide variety of ventilation conditions defined by the American Association of Respiratory Care guidelines for ventilator stockpiling. The large animal test showed that our ventilator performed similarly if not better than a standard ventilator in maintaining optimal ventilation status. The FiO(2), respiratory rate, inspiratory to expiratory time ratio, positive-end expiratory pressure, and peak inspiratory pressure were successfully maintained within normal, clinically validated ranges, and the animals were recovered without any complications. In regions with limited access to ventilators, the ALIVE Vent can help alleviate shortages, and we have ensured that all used materials are publicly available. While this pandemic has elucidated enormous global inequalities in healthcare, innovative, cost-effective solutions aimed at reducing socio-economic barriers, such as the ALIVE Vent, can help enable access to prompt healthcare and life saving technology on a global scale and beyond COVID-19.

The prevalence of respiratory viruses in adults is largely underestimated, and relevant data mostly concern infants and children. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the prevalence of respiratory viruses in adults hospitalized in Italy. STUDY DESIGN: During April 2004–May 2005, 510 consecutive lower respiratory tract samples were prospectively collected. These were evaluated with a molecular panel that detected 12 respiratory viruses. RESULTS: Two hundred and fifteen samples were positive for at least one viral pathogen, with an overall sample prevalence of 42.2%. Human rhinoviruses (HRVs) were the most commonly detected viruses (32.9%), followed by influenza virus (FLU)-A (9.0%); the other viruses were 2% or less. Multiple agents were detected in 30 samples from 29 patients, resulting in a co-infection rate of 6.7%. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows a high prevalence of viruses in the lower respiratory tract samples of hospitalized adults, mostly HRV and FLU-A. It is not possible to establish the role of viruses detected at low frequency, but our findings suggest the necessity to consider them as potential causes or precursors of lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs).","Minosse, C.; Selleri, M.; Zaniratti, M.S.; Cappiello, G.; Longo, R.; Schifano, E.; Spanò, A.; Petrosillo, N.; Lauria, F.N.; Puro, V.; Capobianchi, M.R.",J Clin Virol,289,24

The lockdown in response to COVID-19 may have resulted in lifestyle changes that affected sleep quality. For this reason, the objective of this study is to determine the difference in nursing students’ sleep quality before and during the lockdown, put in place in response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. To meet this objective, we conducted a longitudinal observational study on 207 nursing students, with two cut-off points (February and April). The main dependent variable was sleep quality, measured using the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) and its seven components. Parametric and nonparametric tests were used for paired and unpaired data, as well as group-stratified analysis. The mean time students spent in bed was 7.6 h (standard deviation (SD) = 1.1 h) before lockdown and 8.5 h (SD = 1.2 h) during lockdown. The PSQI score got 0.91 points worse during lockdown (95% CI, −0.51, −1.31). Of the five components, five were statistically significantly affected (p ≤ 0.05), and of these, the most changed were sleep latency, sleep duration, and sleep efficiency. When stratified by group, we observed differences in women, first-year students, second-year students, alcohol consumers, those of normal weight, and those that live with family. The main conclusion is that although students spent more time in bed, overall sleep quality was worse during lockdown, as well as being worse in five of the seven components.","Romero-Blanco, Cristina; Rodríguez-Almagro, Julián; Onieva-Zafra, María Dolores; Parra-Fernández, María Laura; Prado-Laguna, María del Carmen; Hernández-Martínez, Antonio",Int J Environ Res Public Health,289,18

In recent years there has been significant shifts in incidence of this disease due to changes in vaccination and prevention for human papilloma virus (HPV) and its related pathology. This review will highlight the epidemiology, prevention and treatment of RRP. METHODS: The PubMed database was searched using relevant MeSH terms including “recurrent respiratory papillomatosis.” The titles and abstracts were reviewed to assess relevance and unrelated articles were excluded. A full‐text review for select articles was performed, the data and discussions were interpreted and synthesized to create a concise update on the management of RRP. RESULTS: With the increasing utilization of the 9‐valent and quadrivalent HPV vaccine in Australia, we have seen a significant decrease in the incidence of RRP. Preliminary data in the US shows a similar trend of decreased incidence after implementation of vaccination. Single dose Gardasil in developing countries has shown sustained immunization for at least 7 years. Preliminary clinical trials and retrospective studies have shown the HPV vaccine may have benefit as a treatment method in addition to prevention for HPV related diseases. Bevacizumab (Avastin), a VEGF monoclonal antibody, has shown promise as a systemic treatment for RRP. The Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic has affected perioperative management of RRP.

However, it is unclear whether diverse racial/ethnic populations have experienced a disproportionate rise in heart disease and cerebrovascular disease deaths. METHODS: We used the National Center for Health Statistics to identify heart disease and cerebrovascular disease deaths for non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, non-Hispanic Asian, and Hispanic individuals from March to August 2020 (pandemic period), as well as for the corresponding months in 2019 (historical control). We determined the age- and sex-standardized deaths per million by race/ethnicity for each year. We then fit a modified Poisson model with robust SEs to compare change in deaths by race/ethnicity for each condition in 2020 versus 2019. RESULTS: There were a total of 339 076 heart disease and 76 767 cerebrovascular disease deaths from March through August 2020, compared with 321 218 and 72 190 deaths during the same months in 2019. Heart disease deaths increased during the pandemic in 2020, compared with the corresponding period in 2019, for non-Hispanic White (age–sex standardized deaths per million, 1234.2 versus 1208.7; risk ratio for death [RR], 1.02 [95% CI, 1.02–1.03]), non-Hispanic Black (1783.7 versus 1503.8; RR, 1.19 [95% CI, 1.17–1.20]), non-Hispanic Asian (685.7 versus 577.4; RR, 1.19 [95% CI, 1.15–1.22]), and Hispanic (968.5 versus 820.4; RR, 1.18 [95% CI, 1.16–1.20]) populations. Cerebrovascular disease deaths also increased for non-Hispanic White (268.7 versus 258.2; RR, 1.04 [95% CI, 1.03–1.05]), non-Hispanic Black (430.7 versus 379.7; RR, 1.13 [95% CI, 1.10–1.17]), non-Hispanic Asian (236.5 versus 207.4; RR, 1.15 [95% CI, 1.09–1.21]), and Hispanic (264.4 versus 235.9; RR, 1.12 [95% CI, 1.08–1.16]) populations. For both heart disease and cerebrovascular disease deaths, Black, Asian, and Hispanic populations experienced a larger relative increase in deaths than the non-Hispanic White population (interaction term, P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, Black, Hispanic, and Asian populations experienced a disproportionate rise in deaths caused by heart disease and cerebrovascular disease, suggesting that these groups have been most impacted by the indirect effects of the pandemic.

With lockdown measures now easing in some areas, many laboratories are preparing to reopen. This is particularly challenging for clinical research laboratories due to the dual risk of patient samples carrying the virus that causes COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, and the risk to patients being exposed to research staff during clinical sampling. To date, no confirmed transmission of the virus has been confirmed within a laboratory setting; however, operating processes and procedures should be adapted to ensure safe working of samples of positive, negative, or unknown COVID-19 status. OBJECTIVE: In this paper, we propose a framework for reopening a clinical research laboratory and resuming operations with the aim to maximize research capacity while minimizing the risk to research participants and staff. METHODS: This framework was developed by consensus among experienced laboratory staff who have prepared to reopen a clinical research laboratory. RESULTS: Multiple aspects need to be considered to reopen a clinical laboratory. We describe our process to stratify projects by risk, including assessment of donor risk and COVID-19 clinical status, the COVID-19 status of the specific sample type, and how to safely process each sample type. We describe methods to prepare the laboratory for safe working including maintaining social distancing through signage, one-way systems and access arrangements for staff and patients, limiting staff numbers on site and encouraging home working for all nonlaboratory tasks including data analysis and writing.

We sought to assess how neurosurgical training has been affected across Africa in April 2020. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was distributed to African Neurosurgical trainees seeking to review demographics and effects of COVID on training. RESULTS: A total of 123 neurosurgery trainees responded from 23 African countries and a further 6 were abroad. A total of 91.80% were men, and 96.70% were training in public institutions. Only 41% had received training in COVID-19 with 61.79% worried that they would contract COVID-19 while performing their clinical duties. There was a marked reduction in clinical activities including a median reduction of elective surgery (−80%), clinics (−83%), and emergency surgery (−38.50%). A total of 23.58% of residents did not receive a formal salary, with 50% on less than $1000 USD gross per month. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first continental survey of neurosurgery trainees in Africa. COVID-19 has significantly affected clinical and learning opportunities. There are concerns of the long-term effects on their training activities for an uncertain period of time during this pandemic. Although there has been a global increase in e-learning, there is need to evaluate if this is accessible to all trainees.","Cheserem, Jebet Beverly; Esene, Ignatius N.; Mahmud, Muhammad Raji; Kalangu, Kazadi; Sanoussi, Samuila; Musara, Aaron; El-Ghandour, Nasser M.F.; Fieggen, Graham; Qureshi, Mahmood",World Neurosurg,289,26

Independent of virulence variations they are separated into two different types, type I, the original FCoV, and type II, which is closely related to canine coronavirus (CCV). The prevalence of FCoV types in Austrian cat populations without FIP has been surveyed recently indicating that type I infections predominate. The distribution of FCoV types in cats, which had succumbed to FIP, however, was fairly unknown. PCR assays have been developed amplifying parts of the spike protein gene. Type-specific primer pairs were designed, generating PCR products of different sizes. A total of 94 organ pools of cats with histopathologically verified FIP was tested. A clear differentiation was achieved in 74 cats, 86% of them were type I positive, 7% type II positive, and 7% were positive for both types. These findings demonstrate that in FIP cases FCoV type I predominates, too, nonetheless, in 14% of the cases FCoV type II was detected, suggesting its causative involvement in cases of FIP.","Benetka, Viviane; Kübber-Heiss, Anna; Kolodziejek, Jolanta; Nowotny, Norbert; Hofmann-Parisot, Margarete; Möstl, Karin",Vet Microbiol,289,22

MethodsWe used data from two nationwide sources covering the whole of Brazil. Data from the Information System of the National Immunization Program (SIPNI) on the monthly number of vaccine doses administered to young children were analyzed. The second source was a survey in 133 large cities in the 27 states in the country, carried out from August 24-27. Respondents answered a question on whether children under the age of three years had missed any scheduled vaccinations during the pandemic, and available vaccination cards were photographed for later examination. ResultsSIPNI data showed that, relative to January and February 2020, there was a decline of about 20% in vaccines administered to children aged two months or older during March and April, when social distancing was at the highest level in the country. After May, vaccination levels returned to pre-pandemic values. Survey data, based on the interviews and on examination of the vaccine cards, showed that 19.0% (95% CI 17.0;21.1%) and 20.6% (95% CI 19.0;23.1%) of children, respectively, had missed immunizations. Missed doses were most common in the North (Amazon) region and least common in the South and Southeast, and also more common among children from poor than from wealthy families. InterpretationOur results show that the pandemic was associated with a reduction of about 20% in child vaccinations, but this was reverted in recent months. Children from poor families and from the least developed regions of the country were most affected. There is an urgent need to booster immunization activities in the country to compensate for missed doses, and to reduce geographic and socioeconomic inequalities.","Silveira, Mariangela Freitas; Tonial, Cristian T; Maranhao, Ana Goretti Kalume; Teixeira, Antonia MS; Hallal, Pedro; Menezes, Ana Maria Baptista; Horta, Bernardo L; Hartwig, Fernando Pires; Barros, Aluisio JD; Victora, Cesar G",,289,3

Its high transmission rate makes it difficult to control. To date, no specific treatment has been found as a cure for the disease. Therefore, prediction of COVID-19 cases provides a useful insight to mitigate the disease. This study aims to model and predict COVID-19 cases. Eight countries: Italy, New Zealand, the USA, Brazil, India, Pakistan, Spain, and South Africa which are in different phases of COVID-19 distribution as well as in different socioeconomic and geographical characteristics were selected as test cases. The Alpha-Sutte Indicator approach was utilized as the modelling strategy. The capability of the approach in modelling COVID-19 cases over the ARIMA method was tested in the study. Data consist of accumulated COVID-19 cases present in the selected countries from the first day of the presence of cases to September 26, 2020. Ten percent of the data were used to validate the modelling approach. The analysis disclosed that the Alpha-Sutte modelling approach is appropriate in modelling cumulative COVID-19 cases over ARIMA by reporting 0.11%, 0.33%, 0.08%, 0.72%, 0.12%, 0.03%, 1.28%, and 0.08% of the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) for the USA, Brazil, Italy, India, New Zealand, Pakistan, Spain, and South Africa, respectively. Differences between forecasted and real cases of COVID-19 in the validation set were tested using the paired t-test. The differences were not statistically significant, revealing the effectiveness of the modelling approach. Thus, predictions were generated using the Alpha-Sutte approach for each country. Therefore, the Alpha-Sutte method can be recommended for short-term forecasting of cumulative COVID-19 incidences. The authorities in the health care sector and other administrators may use the predictions to control and manage the COVID-19 cases.","Attanayake, A. M. C. H.; Perera, S. S. N.",Biomed Res Int,289,20

STING is also a hub for activation of NF-κB and autophagy. The present review details the striking similarities between T and B cell responses in severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and both animal or human models of STING gain of function (SAVI syndromes: STING-associated vasculopathy with onset in infancy). Those similarities may be further clues for a delayed activation of STING in severe COVID-19 patients, due to DNA damages following severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2) infection and unusual role of STING in SARS-CoV-2 control. In early stages, Th2 differentiation are noticed in both severe COVID-19 and SAVI syndromes; then, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells functional exhaustion/senescent patterns due to TCR hyper-responsiveness are observed. T cell delayed over-responses can contribute to pneumonitis and delayed cytokine secretion with over-production of IL-6. Last, STING over-activation induces progressive CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphopenia in SAVI syndromes, which parallels what is observed in severe COVID-19. ACE2, the main receptor of SARS-CoV-2, is rarely expressed in immune cells, and it has not been yet proven that some human lymphocytes could be infected by SARS-CoV-2 through CD147 or CD26. However, STING, expressed in humans T cells, might be triggered following excessive transfer of cGAMP from infected antigen presenting cells into activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells lymphocytes. Indeed, those lymphocytes highly express the cGAMP importer SLC19A1. Whereas STING is not expressed in human B cells, B cells counts are much less affected, either in COVID-19 or SAVI syndromes. The recognition of delayed STING over-activation in severe COVID-19 patients could prompt to target STING with specific small molecules inhibitors already designed and/or aspirin, which inhibits cGAS.","Berthelot, Jean-Marie; Lioté, Frédéric; Maugars, Yves; Sibilia, Jean",Front Immunol,289,26

In this perspective, technologies are seen as an end in themselves, and there is no arrangement between the technical and the social values of innovation. This vision prevails in sanitary crises, in which management is carried out based on the search for punctual, reactive, and technical solutions to remedy a specific problem without a systemic/holistic, sustainable, or proactive approach. This paper attempts to contribute to the literature on the epistemological orientation of innovations in the field of public health. Taking the Covid-19 and Ebola crises as examples, the primary objective is to show how innovation in health is oriented towards a techno-economic paradigm. Second, we propose a repositioning of public health innovation towards a social paradigm that will put more emphasis on the interaction between social and health dimensions in the perspective of social change. We will conclude by highlighting the roles that public health could play in allowing innovations to have more social value, especially during sanitary crises.","Niang, Marietou; Dupéré, Sophie; Alami, Hassane; Gagnon, Marie-Pierre",Global Health,289,24

The probe cross-hybridized in the dot blot assay with nucleic acid of a closely related feline coronavirus, feline enteric coronavirus (FECV)-79-1683. To construct the probe, a 2.5 kilobase cDNA, prepared from FIPV-DF2 genomic RNA, was molecularly cloned. The recombinant cDNA clone was digested with the restriction endonuclease Rsa I, and an 870 basepair Rsa I fragment was isolated from vector DNA by agarose electrophoresis and glassmilk purification. This fragment was complementary to the 3′ three fourths of the nucleocapsid gene. The hybridization probe was prepared by random primed labeling in the presence of biotin-11-dUTP. Using an avidin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate and chemiluminescent substrate detection system, virus could be detected in as few as 3000 infected cells. In an in vivo study, the probe was used to detect FIPV RNA in peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes (PBML) isolated at various post-infection days (PID) from cats experimentally infected with the FIP-producing coronavirus isolate FIPV-79-1146 or FIPV-DF2. Viral RNA could be detected in as few as 12 000 PBML isolated from cats at PID 7 and in 50 000 PBML at PID 22. There was no consistent pattern, however, between hybridization results and prognosis or severity of disease at the time of sampling. Despite some cross-hybridization with FECV RNA, this probe should be useful for diagnosis of FIP, because cats infected with FECV most likely do not become viremic.","Martinez, Mitzi L.; Weiss, Richard C.",Veterinary Microbiology,289,16

The outbreak and spread of COVID-19 worldwide, highlights the critical need for developing rapid and accurate diagnostic testing methods for emerging human coronavirus (CoV) infections. Testing is crucial to track the spread of disease during a pandemic, and to swiftly permit public health interventions including isolation, quarantine, and appropriate clinical management of afflicted individuals. The key components of viral diagnostic tests are (1) collection of the appropriate sample (blood, nasal swab, and throat swab), (2) availability of the genetic and proteomic sequences of the novel virus for analysis, and (3) rapid and accurate laboratory testing methods. The current gold standard for the molecular diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is the real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the qualitative and quantitative detection of viral nucleic acids. Other relevant laboratory methods include enzyme-linked immunoassays (EIA) for viral antibody and antigen detection, and serum viral neutralization (SVN) assays for antibody neutralization determination. The challenges faced in developing a diagnostic test for a novel pathogen are the ability to measure low viral loads for early detection, to provide low or no cross-reactivity with other viral strains and to deliver results rapidly. Several point-of-care molecular devices are currently being integrated for fast and accurate diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infections.

The shortage in the supply of personal protective equipment (PPE) due to the surging demand in conjuncture with the disposal of an unprecedented quantity of contaminated PPEs into the landfill, led to an interest for alternative platforms for the management of PPEs. In this study, we evaluated the potential of re-using gloves after repeated disinfection cycles using six readily available and common sterilization methods: UV, ethanol, heat, steam, bleach, and Quats (Quaternary ammonium compounds) for the inactivation of SARS-CoV-2. For this, two commercially available medical grade gloves, i.e. nitrile and vinyl (polyvinyl chloride) gloves were tested. Both types of gloves showed deterioration in mechanical and thermal performance with the use of quats as sterilization treatment while no remarkable change in properties was observed up to 20 cycles of disinfection for the other sterilization methods. The exceptions were that the vinyl and nitrile gloves did not tolerate steam/dry heat and UV treatment over 10 cycles due to likely dehydrochlorination and thermal degradation, respectively. Subsequent rounds of sterilization caused no significant change in the glass transition temperature (T g ) of either medical gloves, however quats caused a slight reduction in T g due to its plasticizing effect. Overall, the physical sterilization treatments including steam, dry heat, and UV allowed the gloves to retain their thermomechanical performance up to ten cycles of sterilization.","Esmizadeh, Elnaz; Chang, Boon Peng; Jubinville, Dylan; Seto, Curtis; Ojogbo, Ewomazino; Tzoganakis, Costas; Mekonnen, Tizazu H.",,289,10

Applications in real-world time series should consider two factors for achieving reliable predictions: modeling dynamic dependencies among multiple variables and adjusting the model's intrinsic hyperparameters. A still open gap in that literature is that statistical and ensemble learning approaches systematically present lower predictive performance than deep learning methods. They generally disregard the data sequence aspect entangled with multivariate data represented in more than one time series. Conversely, this work presents a novel neural network architecture for time-series forecasting that combines the power of graph evolution with deep recurrent learning on distinct data distributions; we named our method Recurrent Graph Evolution Neural Network (ReGENN). The idea is to infer multiple multivariate relationships between co-occurring time-series by assuming that the temporal data depends not only on inner variables and intra-temporal relationships (i.e., observations from itself) but also on outer variables and inter-temporal relationships (i.e., observations from other-selves). An extensive set of experiments was conducted comparing ReGENN with dozens of ensemble methods and classical statistical ones, showing sound improvement of up to 64.87% over the competing algorithms. Furthermore, we present an analysis of the intermediate weights arising from ReGENN, showing that by looking at inter and intra-temporal relationships simultaneously, time-series forecasting is majorly improved if paying attention to how multiple multivariate data synchronously evolve.","Spadon, Gabriel; Hong, Shenda; Brandoli, Bruno; Matwin, Stan; Rodrigues-Jr, Jose F.; Sun, Jimeng",IEEE transactions on pattern analysis and machine intelligence,289,16

The 5 specimens from Case A, Case B, Case C, Case D, and Case E were tentatively designated as XG5138-Case A-GZ-2021-05-21, XG5370-Case B-GZ-2021-05-23, XG5571-Case C-MM-2021-05-24, XG5647-Case D-GZ-2021-05-26, and XG5645-Case E-GZ-2021-05-26, respectively, in this study. Compared with the reference genome sequence Wuhan-Hu-1 (2-3), the genome sequences coverage of these 5 strains were 99.89%, 99.85%, 99.86%, 99.86%, and 99.87%, respectively. Based on the “Pango lineages” rule, the 5 virus strains from this study were assigned to delta (B.1.617.2), which was also known as variant of concern (VOC) Delta (Figure 1) (4-6). Compared with the reference genome sequence Wuhan-Hu-1, 5 strains shared 35 nucleotide variation sites (G210T, C241T, C1191T, C1267T, C3037T, C5184T, T6023C, C9598T, C9891T, T11418C, T12946C, C14408T, G15451A, C16466T, C18176T, A20262G, A21137G, C21618G, G21987A, T22917G, C22995A, A23403G, C23604G, G24410A, G25088T, C25469T, A25562G, T26767C, T27638C, C27739T, C27752T, A28461G, G28881T, G29402T, and G29742T) and 7 deletion mutations (22029–22035, 28248–28254, and 28274). Except for the mutations above, another variation site (C27092T) was observed in genome of the strain XG5571-Case C-MM-2021-05-24, XG5647-Case D-GZ-2021-05-26, and XG5645-Case E-GZ-2021-05-26. XG5370-Case B-GZ-2021-05-23 had a unique variation site (T21673C), but not the C27092T variation. By comparing deduced amino acid sequences, the 5 strains displayed 29 AA variation sites (M:I82T;N:D63G, R203M, D377Y;ORF1a:P309L, P1640L, Y1920H, A3209V, V3718A;ORF1b:P314L, G662S, P1000L, P1570L, K2557R;ORF3a:S26L, Q57R;ORF7a:V82A, L116F, T120I;ORF9b:T60A;S:T19R, G142D, R158G, L452R, T478K, D614G, P681R, D950N, and V1176F) and 4 deletion mutations (ORF8:D119del, F120del;S:F156del, and R157del). The delta (B.1.617.2) was first identified in India in October 2020 and its spike protein had 9–10 characteristic mutations: T19R, (G142D), 156del, 157del, R158G, L452R, T478K, D614G, P681R, and D950N (4-5,7). According to the current data of the World Health Organization (WHO), the delta (B.1.617.2) spread rapidly to 74 countries, areas, or territories (December 2019–June 8, 2021) (5). The epidemiological investigation showed that Case A was the index case and Case B (husband) was a close contact of Case A. Furthermore, Case C and Case E were at high risk of exposure due to Case A’ s activities (Case C as a waiter served Case A in a restaurant, and Case E went to same restaurant for dinner at the same time). Lastly, Case D was the grandson of Case E and was therefore a close contact. The whole gene sequencing results showed that Case C, Case D, and Case E added a common mutation site (C27092T) based on the sequence of Case A, and Case B possessed a new mutation site (T21673C) compared with Case A’s sequence. This Guangzhou outbreak is the first local transmission caused by delta (B.1.617.2) in China. The transmissibility and pathogenicity of these mutant variants urgently need more attention.","Li, Zhencui; Nie, Kai; Li, Kuibiao; Hu, Yao; Song, Yang; Kang, Min; Zhang, Meng; Deng, Xiaoling; Yuan, Jun; Xu, Wenbo; Li, Baisheng",China CDC Wkly,289,4

Little is known about impacts on pediatric orthopaedic surgeons during this time. We aimed to investigate COVID-19-related changes in practice, training, and research among pediatric orthopaedic surgeons globally. METHODS: An online survey was administered to orthopaedic surgeons with interest in pediatrics in April 2020 and a follow-up was administered in February 2021. The surveys captured demographics and surgeons’ self-reported experiences during the pandemic. Participants were recruited from web media and available email lists of orthopaedic societies over a 2-month period. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze results, stratified by the severity of local COVID-19-related measures. RESULTS: A total of 460 responses from 45 countries were collected for initial survey. Of these, 358 (78.5%) respondents reported lockdown measures in their region at time of survey. Most (n=337, 94.4%) reported pausing all elective procedures. Surgeons reported a reduction in the average number of surgeries per week, from 6.89 (SD=4.61) prepandemic to 1.25 (SD=2.26) at time of survey (mean difference=5.64; 95% confidence interval=5.19, 6.10). Average number of elective outpatient appointments per week decreased from 67.89 (SD=45.78) prepandemic to 11.79 (SD=15.83) at time of survey (mean difference=56.10, 95% confidence interval=5.61, 60.58). In total, 177 (39.4%) surgeons reported using virtual modes of outpatient appointments for the first time. Of 290 surgeons with trainees, 223 (84.5%) reported implementation of systems to continue training such as webinars or virtual rounds. Of 192 respondents with research, 149 (82.8%) reported continuing research activities during the pandemic with most reporting either cessation (n=75, 64.15%), or reduction (n=25, 29.9%) in participant recruitment. A total of 111 responses from 28 countries were collected during follow-up. Surgeons described policy and circumstantial changes that facilitated resumption of clinical work. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic and its related counter measures have had significant impacts on pediatric orthopaedic practice and increased uptake of technology to provide care continuity. Rigorous epidemiological studies are needed to assess impacts of delayed and virtual care on patient outcomes.","Gibbard, Marissa; Ponton, Ethan; Sidhu, Bernita V.; Farrell, Sarah; Bone, Jeffrey N.; Wu, Luke A.; Schaeffer, Emily; Cooper, Anthony; Aroojis, Alaric; Mulpuri, Kishore",J Pediatr Orthop,289,20

Although many children who wheeze with respiratory viruses during infancy outgrow the problem, most children with asthma and reductions in lung function at school age begin wheezing during the first several years of life. Whether symptomatic viral infections of the lower respiratory tract are causal in asthma development or simply identify predisposed children remains a controversial issue. Wheezing illnesses caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), particularly those severe enough to lead to hospitalization, have historically been associated with an increased risk of asthma at school age. However, with the development of molecular diagnostics, human rhinovirus (HRV) wheezing illnesses have been recognized more recently as a stronger predictor of school-age asthma than RSV. In this article, the authors review the impact of virus infections during early life, focusing primarily on RSV and HRV, and their potential roles in asthma inception.","Jackson, Daniel J.; Lemanske, Robert F.",Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America,289,24

A retrospective analysis of data concerning THA and TKA collected by the National Health Fund in Poland in 2019 and in 2020 has been conducted. The number of primary hip or knee arthroplasties in 2020 was around 71% and 67% of the number registered in 2019, respectively. There was also a decline in the volume of revision arthroplasties observed, with 65% and 63% of THA and TKA revisions performed in 2019. The most significant decrease was observed in April and May, and during the second wave of the pandemic in November 2020, with a decline of 87%, 55% and 56%, respectively. The results of this study show the significant impacts that the COVID-19 pandemic had on the volume of elective hip and knee arthroplasties in Poland in 2020. In comparison with 2019, a decrease of around 30% for primary and of 40% for revision arthroplasties was observed.

Yet, the information provided by analyzing data from population-wide testing is critical to understand the infection dynamics and devise control strategies. We described clinical features and assessed antibody response in people screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection. We analyzed data from a cohort of 3464 people that we molecularly screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection in our routine activity. We recorded people SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, age, gender, blood types, white blood cells (WBC), symptoms, chronic disease status and time to SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR conversion from positive to negative. We calculated the age-based distribution of SARS-CoV-2 infection, analyzed the proportion and the spectrum of COVID-19 severity. Furthermore, in a nested sub-study, we screened 83 COVID-19 patients and 319 contact-cases for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Males and females accounted for respectively 51% and 49% of people screened. The studied population median and mean age were both 39 years. 592 out of 3464 people (17.2%) were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection with males and females representing, respectively, 53% and 47%. The median and mean ages of SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects were 37 and 38 years respectively. The lowest rate of infection (8%) was observed in the elderly (aged > 60). The rate of SARS-Cov-2 infection in both young (18–35 years old) and middle-aged adults (36–60 years old) was around 20%. The analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infection age distribution showed that middle-aged adults accounted for 54.7% of SARS-CoV-2 positive persons, followed respectively by young adults (33.7%), children (7.7%) and elderly (3.8%). 68% (N = 402) of SARS-CoV-2 infected persons were asymptomatic, 26.3% (N = 156) had influenza-like symptoms, 2.7% (N = 16) had influenza-like symptoms associated with anosmia and ageusia, 2% (N = 11) had dyspnea and 1% (N = 7) had respiratory failure, which resulted in death. Data also showed that 12% of SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects, had chronic diseases. Hypertension, diabetes, and asthma were the top concurrent chronic diseases representing respectively 58%, 25% and 12% of recorded chronic diseases. Half of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive patients were cured within 14 days following the initiation of the anti-COVID-19 treatment protocol. 78.3% of COVID-19 patients and 55% of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR confirmed negative contact-cases were positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Patients with severe-to-critical illness have higher leukocytes, higher neutrophils and lower lymphocyte counts contrarily to asymptomatic patients and patients with mild-to-moderate illness. Neutrophilic leukopenia was more prevalent in asymptomatic patients and patients with mild-to-moderate disease for 4 weeks after diagnosis (27.1–42.1%). In Patients with severe-to-critical illness, neutrophilic leukocytosis or neutrophilia (35.6–50%) and lymphocytopenia (20–40%) were more frequent. More than 60% of participants were blood type O. It is also important to note that infection rate was slightly higher among A and B blood types compared with type O. In this African setting, young and middle-aged adults are most likely driving community transmission of COVID-19. The rate of critical disease is relatively low. The high rate of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies observed in SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR negative contact cases suggests that subclinical infection may have been overlooked in our setting.","Mveang Nzoghe, Amandine; Padzys, Guy-Stephan; Maloupazoa Siawaya, Anicet Christel; Kandet Yattara, Marisca; Leboueny, Marielle; Avome Houechenou, Rotimi Myrabelle; Bongho, Eliode Cyrien; Mba-Mezeme, Cedrick; Mvoundza Ndjindji, Ofilia; Biteghe-Bi-Essone, Jean Claude; Boulende, Alain; Essone, Paulin N.; Ndong Sima, Carene Anne Alene; Minkobame, Ulysse; Zang Eyi, Carinne; Ndeboko, Bénédicte; Voloc, Alexandru; Meye, Jean-François; Ategbo, Simon; Djoba Siawaya, Joel Fleury",Sci Rep,289,20

Although the diagnostic protocols were established only 2 years ago, mismatches between the sequences of primers/probes and viruses were found for several of the assays. Such mismatches could lead to a lower sensitivity of the assay, thereby leading to false-negative diagnosis. A slight modification in the primer design is suggested.

Melatonin, an antioxidant was used in the present study to evaluate its effectiveness on skin carcinogenesis induced by DMBA both with and without chronic restraint stress (CRS). Fifty Swiss albino young male rats were divided into five groups of 10 rats each as controls, topical DMB alone, Pre CRS-DMBA, melatonin DMBA and Pre-CRS-DMBA-melatonin treated groups. After 18 weeks blood was collected along with liver and skin samples. These were used for antioxidant enzyme assay, DNA damage and fluorescent spectra analysis. Melatonin showed antioxidant potential in combatting DMBA induced skin carcinogenesis measured by free radical scavenging enzymes and in vivo antioxidant status, DNA damage. Sensitive detection of the DMBA induced micro biochemical changes was possible by fluorescent spectroscopy from the transformed ratio of fluorescent intensity (F1 530 nm/630 nm) otherwise found constant for normal tissues. By melatonin treatment this ratio was similar to control values. The decreased antioxidant biochemical parameters depicting oxidative stress were comparable to comet assay and fluorescent studies, endorsing the chemo-preventive efficacy of melatonin against skin carcinogenesis caused by DMBA. CRS pre-exposure diminished the chemo-preventive/antioxidant ability of melatonin and the results were same as DMBA alone treatment, showing stress affected both cancer development and chemoprevention. CRS decreased the antioxidant potential of melatonin. Hence, managing stress could be perceived in cancer chemoprevention.

Longitudinal studies evaluated the severity of the disease and the number of cases. Respondents (447) were divided into “working group” and “risk group” (retirees with chronic diseases). During the lockdown period (in mid-2020), accelerated aging was observed in the group of workers (by 3.9–8 years for men and an increase at the tendency level for women). However, the respondents began to feel subjectively younger (by 3.3–7.2 years). In the risk group, there were no deviations from the expected biopsychological aging. The number of cases at the end of 2020 was 31% in workers and 0% in the risk group. Reasonably, the risk group followed the quarantine rules more strictly by 1.5 times. In working men, indicators of relative biological and relative subjective aging (measured in both 2019 and mid-2020) significantly influenced the incidence at the end of 2020. In women, only the indicators obtained in mid-2020 had a significant impact. The relative biological aging of an individual tested in the middle of 2020 had a direct impact on the risk of infection (p < 0.05) and on the probability of death (p < 0.0001). On the contrary, an increase in the relative subjective (psychological) aging index reduced the risk of infection (at the tendency level, p = 0.06) and the risk of death (p < 0.0001). Both the risk of infection and the risk of death increased with calendar age at the tendency level. Conclusions: Indicators of individual relative biological and subjective aging affect the probability of getting COVID-19 and its severity. The combination of high indicators of biological aging and underestimated indicators of subjective aging is associated with increased chances of developing severe forms of the disease.","Berezina, Tatiana N.; Rybtsov, Stanislav",Biomedicines,289,16

But while biology played a crucial role in triggering the pandemic, the resulting crisis developed through a social process. In this paper, I argue that the coronavirus pandemic in Britain was successfully framed as a crisis, but that the ritualization of solidarity normally generated by this meaning was compromised. Through an analysis of media coverage and official statements from the government, I trace the discursive construction of the crisis through the deployment of battle metaphors. Building on this discourse analysis, I show how the symbolic alignment of the pandemic and the Second World War revived symbols and tropes that informed the cultural construction of pandemic heroes. To explain why the intensity of the crisis framing was not matched in ritual performance, I consider how the government’s ambiguous policies and erratic social performance produced a state of indefinite liminality, subverting solidarity processes in lockdown. The paper offers insight into the experience of anomie during the pandemic and contributes to the strong program in cultural sociology by incorporating the crisis approach in disaster studies into the social drama framework.","McCormick, Lisa",Am J Cult Sociol,289,21

This study aimed to document attitudes of the general population toward a future vaccine against COVID-19. We used the national COCONEL surveys conducted during the lockdown to identify factors associated with vaccine refusal, in the whole population, and separately among men and women. We investigate the role of socioeconomic and demographic factors as well as exposure to COVID-19. Among the 5,018 participants, 24.0% reported their intention to refuse the vaccine. Thinking this vaccine would not be safe, being against vaccination in general, and perceiving COVID-19 to be harmless were the three main reasons given to explain vaccine refusal. Women were more likely to refuse the vaccine, especially due to a reluctance toward vaccination in general or the perception that a COVID-19 vaccine would not be safe. Some factors associated with the intention to refuse the vaccine were the same among men and women such as a lack of prior vaccination against influenza, and concern over being infected with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), while others differed slightly according to gender such as age, and high prevalence of COVID-19 in their region of residence. Authorities should therefore guarantee that all the necessary precautions are taken before marketing the vaccine and communicate transparently on the process of its development, and on the coverage rate required to reach herd immunity.Abbreviation: EHI: Equivalized Household Income per month; SARS-CoV-2: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.","Alleaume, Caroline; Verger, Pierre; Dib, Fadia; Ward, Jeremy K; Launay, Odile; Peretti-Watel, Patrick",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,289,18

The mtDNA reference sequences were established on the basis of the complete sequences of two diseased and two nondiseased animals as well as partial sequences of 26 further individuals. The A. jubatus mitochondrial genome is 17,047-bp long and shows a high sequence similarity (91%) to the domestic cat. Based on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the control region (CR) and pedigree information, the 18 myelopathic and 12 non-myelopathic cheetahs included in this study were classified into haplotypes I, II and III. In view of the phenotypic comparability of the neurodegenerative disease observed in cheetahs and human mtDNA-associated diseases, specific coding regions including the tRNAs leucine UUR, lysine, serine UCN, and partial complex I and V sequences were screened. We identified a heteroplasmic and a homoplasmic SNP at codon 507 in the subunit 5 (MTND5) of complex I. The heteroplasmic haplotype I-specific valine to methionine substitution represents a nonconservative amino acid change and was found in 11 myelopathic and eight non-myelopathic cheetahs with levels ranging from 29% to 79%. The homoplasmic conservative amino acid substitution valine to alanine was identified in two myelopathic animals of haplotype II. In addition, a synonymous SNP in the codon 76 of the MTND4L gene was found in the single haplotype III animal. The amino acid exchanges in the MTND5 gene were not associated with the occurrence of neurodegenerative disease in captive cheetahs.","Burger, Pamela A; Steinborn, Ralf; Walzer, Christian; Petit, Thierry; Mueller, Mathias; Schwarzenberger, Franz",Gene,289,20

We have shown that infection with RbCV results in the development of myocarditis and congestive heart failure and that some survivors of RbCV infection go on to develop dilated cardiomyopathy in the chronic phase. Serial ECGs were recorded on 31 RbCV-infected rabbits. Measurements of heart rate; P-R interval; QRS duration; QTc interval; and P-, QRS-, and T-wave voltages were taken. The recordings were also examined for disturbances of conduction, rhythm, and repolarization. The acute and subacute phases were characterized by sinus tachycardia with depressed R- and T-wave voltages as well as disturbances of conduction, rhythm, and repolarization. In most animals in the chronic phase, the sinus rate returned to near-baseline values with resolution of the QRS voltage changes. The ECG changes observed during RbCV infection are similar to the spectrum of interval/segment abnormalities, rhythm disturbances, conduction defects, and myocardial pathology seen in human myocarditis, heart failure, and dilated cardiomyopathy. Because animals often died suddenly in the absence of severe clinical signs of congestive heart failure during the acute phase, RbCV infection may increase ventricular vulnerability, resulting in sudden cardiac death. RbCV infection may provide a rare opportunity to study sudden cardiac death in an animal model in which the ventricle is capable of supporting ventricular fibrillation, and invasive techniques monitoring cardiac function can be performed.","Alexander, Lorraine K.; Keene, Bruce W.; Yount, Boyd L.; Geratz, Joachim Dieter; Small, J.David; Baric, Ralph S.",Journal of Electrocardiology,289,24

When the outbreak of this apparently novel infectious disease termed severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) came to an end in July 2003, it had caused over 8000 probable cases worldwide and more than 700 deaths. Starting in March 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) organised an unprecedented international effort by leading laboratories working together to find the causative agent. Little more than one week later, three research groups from this WHO-coordinated network simultaneously found evidence of a hitherto unknown coronavirus in SARS patients, using different approaches. After Koch’s postulates had been fulfilled, WHO officially declared on 16 April 2003 that this virus never before seen in humans is the cause of SARS. Ever since, progress around SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has been swift. Within weeks of the first isolate being obtained, its complete genome was sequenced. Diagnostic tests based on the detection of SARS-CoV RNA were developed and made available freely and widely; nevertheless the SARS case definition still remains based on clinical and epidemiological criteria. The agent’s environmental stability, methods suitable for inactivation and disinfection, and potential antiviral compounds have been studied, and development of vaccines and immunotherapeutics is ongoing. Despite its grave consequences in humanitarian, political and economic terms, SARS may serve as an example of how much can be achieved through a well-coordinated international approach, combining the latest technological advances of molecular virology with more “traditional” techniques carried out to an excellent standard.","Berger, A.; Drosten, Ch.; Doerr, H.W.; Stürmer, M.; Preiser, W.",J Clin Virol,289,16

We investigated its interactions with 3 chlorine disinfectants to determine if the additive would adversely affect the disinfectants' antimicrobial efficacy or skin safety. METHODS: We tested 0.5% sodium hypochlorite, 0.2% calcium hypochlorite, and 0.5% sodium dichloroisocyanurate (NaDCC) alone versus with color additive. An independent laboratory tested efficacy against Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Vibrio cholerae, and human coronavirus 229E. An independent laboratory also tested direct skin irritation. RESULTS: Chlorine disinfectants with and without color additive achieved equal levels of efficacy against the tested pathogens. Against S. aureus, 0.5% sodium hypochlorite with and without color additive met Environmental Protection Agency criteria for disinfection success. Against human coronavirus 229E, 0.5% sodium hypochlorite alone failed disinfection success criteria, whereas 0.5% sodium hypochlorite with color additive achieved full viral inactivation (≥4.50 log(10) reduction). Against V. cholerae, 0.2% calcium hypochlorite alone and with color additive achieved 5.99 log(10) and >6.03 log(10) reductions, respectively. Against S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, 0.5% NaDCC with and without color additive achieved >4.9 log(10) and >3.54 log(10) reductions, respectively.

The vaccine shows high efficacy in preventing infection against HPV types 16 and 18 responsible for 70% of cervical cancer. However, to be most effective, the vaccine needs to be administered before exposure to the viruses and therefore, ideally, before young people become sexually active. The introduction of any new vaccine, and perhaps particularly one given to young teenage girls to prevent a sexually transmitted cancer-causing virus, has the potential to attract a great deal of media attention. This paper reports on content analysis of 344 articles published between January 2005 and December 2008 in 15 UK newspapers. It includes both manifest and latent analysis to examine newsprint media coverage of the introduction of the HPV vaccination programme and its role in HPV advocacy. We concluded that the newspapers were generally positive towards the new HPV vaccination and that over the 4 years period the newsworthiness of the HPV vaccination programme increased. In 2008 two events dominated coverage, firstly, the introduction of the HPV programme in September 2008 and secondly, in August 2008 the diagnosis on camera of cervical cancer given to Jade Goody, a 27 year old mother of two, who gained fame and notoriety in the UK through her participation in several reality television shows. There are two conclusions from this study. Firstly, the positive media coverage surrounding the introduction of the HPV vaccination programme is to be welcomed as it is likely to contribute towards influencing public perceptions about the acceptability and need for HPV vaccination. Secondly, the focus on prevalence rates of HPV infection among women and on women's sexual behaviours, in relation to HPV vaccination ‘encouraging’ promiscuity, is an unhelpful aspect of media coverage.","Hilton, Shona; Hunt, Kate; Langan, Mairi; Bedford, Helen; Petticrew, Mark",Social Science & Medicine,289,20

In medical imaging research, image processing techniques tend to be vital in analyzing and resolving diseases with a high degree of accuracy. This paper establishes a new image classification and segmentation method through simulation techniques, conducted over images of COVID-19 patients in India, introducing the use of Quantum Machine Learning (QML) in medical practice. METHODS: This study establishes a prototype model for classifying COVID-19, comparing it with non-COVID pneumonia signals in Computed tomography (CT) images. The simulation work evaluates the usage of quantum machine learning algorithms, while assessing the efficacy for deep learning models for image classification problems, and thereby establishes performance quality that is required for improved prediction rate when dealing with complex clinical image data exhibiting high biases. RESULTS: The study considers a novel algorithmic implementation leveraging quantum neural network (QNN). The proposed model outperformed the conventional deep learning models for specific classification task. The performance was evident because of the efficiency of quantum simulation and faster convergence property solving for an optimization problem for network training particularly for large-scale biased image classification task. The model run-time observed on quantum optimized hardware was 52 min, while on K80 GPU hardware it was 1 h 30 min for similar sample size. The simulation shows that QNN outperforms DNN, CNN, 2D CNN by more than 2.92% in gain in accuracy measure with an average recall of around 97.7%. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that quantum neural networks outperform in COVID-19 traits’ classification task, comparing to deep learning w.r.t model efficacy and training time.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the rate of ischemic stroke between patients with Covid-19 and patients with influenza, a respiratory viral illness previously linked to stroke. DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Two academic hospitals in New York City. PARTICIPANTS: We included adult patients with emergency department visits or hospitalizations with Covid-19 from March 4, 2020 through May 2, 2020. Our comparison cohort included adult patients with emergency department visits or hospitalizations with influenza A or B from January 1, 2016 through May 31, 2018 (calendar years spanning moderate and severe influenza seasons). EXPOSURES: Covid-19 infection confirmed by evidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the nasopharynx by polymerase chain reaction, and laboratory-confirmed influenza A or B. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: A panel of neurologists adjudicated the primary outcome of acute ischemic stroke and its clinical characteristics, etiological mechanisms, and outcomes. We used logistic regression to compare the proportion of Covid-19 patients with ischemic stroke versus the proportion among patients with influenza. RESULTS: Among 2,132 patients with emergency department visits or hospitalizations with Covid-19, 31 patients (1.5%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.0%-2.1%) had an acute ischemic stroke. The median age of patients with stroke was 69 years (interquartile range, 66-78) and 58% were men. Stroke was the reason for hospital presentation in 8 (26%) cases. For our comparison cohort, we identified 1,516 patients with influenza, of whom 0.2% (95% CI, 0.0-0.6%) had an acute ischemic stroke. After adjustment for age, sex, and race, the likelihood of stroke was significantly higher with Covid-19 than with influenza infection (odds ratio, 7.5; 95% CI, 2.3-24.9). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Approximately 1.5% of patients with emergency department visits or hospitalizations with Covid-19 experienced ischemic stroke, a rate 7.5-fold higher than in patients with influenza. Future studies should investigate the thrombotic mechanisms in Covid-19 in order to determine optimal strategies to prevent disabling complications like ischemic stroke.","Merkler, Alexander E.; Parikh, Neal S.; Mir, Saad; Gupta, Ajay; Kamel, Hooman; Lin, Eaton; Lantos, Joshua; Schenck, Edward J.; Goyal, Parag; Bruce, Samuel S.; Kahan, Joshua; Lansdale, Kelsey N.; LeMoss, Natalie M.; Murthy, Santosh B.; Stieg, Philip E.; Fink, Matthew E.; Iadecola, Costantino; Segal, Alan Z.; Campion, Thomas R.; Diaz, Ivan; Zhang, Cenai; Navi, Babak B.",medRxiv,289,21

We used a masked repetition priming paradigm to find out whether words retain their readability when viewed in atypical orientations. Subjects had to read out upright target words that were preceded by rotated prime words of the same or different identity. Priming duration was varied in Experiment 1 to assess the temporal emergence of a rotated priming effect. In Experiment 2, the letter order of the prime words was reversed in order to differentiate the processing stage where priming occurs. The orientational pattern of the priming effects seen in our results mostly confirms earlier word recognition models, but also serves a more detailed view about the effects of orientation on word form processing.","Benyhe, András; Csibri, Péter",Mem Cognit,289,20

One of the most effective strategies in reducing the severity of the pandemic is social distancing, where members of the population systematically reduce their interactions with others to limit the transmission rate of the virus. However, the implementation of social distancing can be difficult and costly, making it imperative that both policy makers and the citizenry understand the potential benefits if done correctly and the risks if not. In this work, a mathematical model is developed to study the effects of social distancing on the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in Canada. The model is based upon a standard epidemiological SEIRD model that has been stratified to directly incorporate the proportion of individuals who are following social distancing protocols. The model parameters characterizing the disease are estimated from current epidemiological data on COVID-19 using machine learning techniques. The results of the model show that social distancing policies in Canada have already saved thousands of lives and that the prolonged adherence to social distancing guidelines could save thousands more. Importantly, our model indicates that social distancing can significantly delay the onset of infection peaks, allowing more time for the production of a vaccine or additional medical resources. Furthermore, our results stress the importance of easing social distancing restrictions gradually, rather than all at once, in order to prevent a second wave of infections. Model results are compared to the current capacity of the Canadian healthcare system by examining the current and future number of ventilators available for use, emphasizing the need for the increased production of additional medical resources.","Eastman, Brydon; Meaney, Cameron; Przedborski, Michelle; Kohandel, Mohammad",,289,20

Some variability was seen on T2*GRE and on T1W images with masses being isointense to hyperintense. Four ependymomas were small and homogeneous, and one was centrally cavitated. All cats had obstructive hydrocephalus, transtentorial herniation, and foramen magnum herniation. Perilesional edema was identified in most cats but was questionable in one. Intraventricular ependymoma should be considered as a differential diagnosis for cats with this combination of MRI signs.","DeJesus, Antonia; Cohen, Eli B.; Galban, Evelyn; Suran, Jantra Ngosuwan",Vet Radiol Ultrasound,289,16

In Pakistan, until 5th September 2020, a total of 6342 deaths have been reported, of which 1255 were from the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) province. To understand the disease progression and control and also to produce vaccines and therapeutic efforts, whole genome sequence analysis is important. In the current investigation, we sequenced a single sample of SARS-CoV-2 genomes (accession no. MT879619) from a male suspect from Peshawar, the KPK capital city, during the first wave of infection. The local SARS-CoV-2 strain shows some unique characteristics compared to neighboring Iranian and Chinese isolates in phylogenetic tree and mutations. The circulating strains of SARS-CoV-2 represent an intermediate evolution from China and Iran. Furthermore, eight complete whole genome sequences, including the current Pakistani isolates which have been submitted to Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GSAID), were also investigated for specific mutations and characters. Some novel mutations [NSP2 (D268del), NSP5 (N228K), and NS3 (F105S)] and specific characters have been detected in the coding regions, which may affect viral transmission, epidemiology, and disease severity. The computational modeling revealed that a majority of these mutations may have a stabilizing effect on the viral protein structure. In conclusion, the genome sequencing of local strains is important for better understanding the pathogenicity, immunogenicity, and epidemiology of causative agents.","Khan, Muhammad Tahir; Ali, Sajid; Khan, Anwar Sheed; Muhammad, Noor; Khalil, Faiza; Ishfaq, Muhammad; Irfan, Muhammad; Al-Sehemi, Abdullah G.; Muhammad, Shabbir; Malik, Arif; Khan, Taj Ali; Wei, Dong Qing",ACS Omega,289,29

METHODS: We report a case series of 5 young male patients with cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR)-confirmed acute myocarditis within 72 h after receiving a dose of an mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine. RESULTS: Our case series suggests that myocarditis in this setting is characterized by myocardial edema and late gadolinium enhancement in the lateral wall of the left ventricular (LV) myocardium, reduced global LV longitudinal strain, and preserved LV ejection fraction. All patients in our series remained clinically stable during a relatively short inpatient hospital stay. CONCLUSIONS: In conjunction with other recently published case series and national vaccine safety surveillance data, this case series suggests a possible association between acute myocarditis and COVID-19 vaccination in young males and highlights a potential pattern in accompanying CMR abnormalities.","Patel, Yash R.; Louis, David W.; Atalay, Michael; Agarwal, Saurabh; Shah, Nishant R.",J Cardiovasc Magn Reson,289,1

Patients with Cystic fibrosis are considered of major risk, as respiratory tract infections are more severe than in the general population, with a higher risk of complications and a negative impact on lung function. The performance of physical exercise is considered as key for its well‐known general benefits and also as a complementary method to help airway clearance. Therefore, physical exercise is also considered as key in the therapeutic strategy during the quarantine period. However, the impossibility to perform exercise with appropriate prescription and monitoring is of considerable worry to health care professionals. Thus, alternative strategies, such as online measures to monitor this therapy and, consequently, to achieve a safe and effective dose are highly needed. Exercise regimens should include strength and endurance, as well as balance and flexibility exercises. Patients are highly encouraged to participate in exercise programs to maintain fitness and exercise should be continued during the quarantine period.

Objectives: To assess outcomes following COVID-19 in patients with ILD versus those without in a contemporaneous age, sex and comorbidity matched population. Methods: An international multicentre audit of patients with a prior diagnosis of ILD admitted to hospital with COVID-19 between 1 March and 1 May 2020 was undertaken and compared with patients, without ILD obtained from the ISARIC 4C cohort, admitted with COVID-19 over the same period. The primary outcome was survival. Secondary analysis distinguished IPF from non-IPF ILD and used lung function to determine the greatest risks of death. Measurements and Main Results: Data from 349 patients with ILD across Europe were included, of whom 161 were admitted to hospital with laboratory or clinical evidence of COVID-19 and eligible for propensity-score matching. Overall mortality was 49% (79/161) in patients with ILD with COVID-19. After matching ILD patients with COVID-19 had higher mortality (HR 1.60, Confidence Intervals 1.17-2.18 p=0.003) compared with age, sex and co-morbidity matched controls without ILD. Patients with a Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) of <80% had an increased risk of death versus patients with FVC [≥]80% (HR 1.72, 1.05-2.83). Furthermore, obese patients with ILD had an elevated risk of death (HR 1.98, 1.13-3.46). Conclusions: Patients with ILD are at increased risk of death from COVID-19, particularly those with poor lung function and obesity. Stringent precautions should be taken to avoid COVID-19 in patients with ILD.","Jenkins, G.; Drake, T.; Docherty, A.

The declaration of COVID-19 as a global pandemic by the World Health Organisation ignited widespread pronouncements of national state of disasters in various countries around the globe including Zimbabwe. Subsequently, like other countries, Zimbabwe followed the precautionary measures outlined by the WHO and pronounced its national lockdown to curtail the transmission of the virus. This paper intends to demonstrate how convergence of the COVID-19 pandemic and climate change impacts serves as a double injustice for rural women in Nyanga communities, Zimbabwe. The study was qualitative in nature guided by the descriptive research design. Twenty participants comprising rural women and social workers were selected using purposive and convenience sampling techniques. Data were collected using focus group discussions and key informant interviews. The Thematic Content Analysis was followed to analyse the data from which the findings were derived. This study established that the COVID-19 pandemic is enhancing the catastrophic implications created by climate change on rural women whose food security systems are shattered, livelihood strategies maimed, caregiving roles burgeoning, and access to healthcare systems compromised. This daunting double impact is aggravated by gender inequalities, social exclusion and patriarchal dominance. The centrality of social justice to social work connotes that the profession has a tendentious responsibility to stand in the gap and liberate women from the jaws of these double catastrophes (climate change and COVID-19).","Nyahunda, Louis; Chibvura, Shyleen; Tirivangasi, Happy Mathew",J Hum Rights Soc Work,289,30

However, early detection of clinical specimens for SARS-CoV2 remains a challenge due to false-negative results with viral RNA and host antibodies based testing. In this manuscript, a microfluidic chip with femtoliter-sized wells was fabricated for the sensitive digital detection of N protein. Briefly, β-galactosidase (β-Gal)-linked antibody/N protein/aptamer immunocomplexes were formed on magnetic beads (MBs). Afterwards, the MBs and β-Gal substrate fluorescein-di-β-d-galactopyranoside (FDG) were injected into the chip together. Each well of the chip would only hold one MB as confined by the diameter of the wells. The MBs in the wells were sealed by fluorocarbon oil, which confines the fluorescent (FL) product generated from the reaction between β-Gal and FDG in the individual femtoliter-sized well and creates a locally high concentration of the FL product. The FL images of the wells were acquired using a conventional inverted FL microscope. The number of FL wells with MBs (FL wells number) and the number of wells with MBs (MBs wells number) were counted, respectively. The percentage of FL wells was calculated by dividing (FL wells number) by (MBs wells number). The higher the percentage of FL wells, the higher the N protein concentration. The detection limit of this digital method for N protein was 33.28 pg/mL, which was 300 times lower than traditional double-antibody sandwich based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).","Ge, Chenchen; Feng, Juan; Zhang, Jiaming; Hu, Kai; Wang, Dou; Zha, Ling; Hu, Xuejuan; Li, Rongsong",Talanta,289,1

A total of 14 ACPA mAbs were evaluated for predicted N-linked glycosylation motifs in silico and compared to 452 highly-mutated mAbs from RA patients and controls. Variable region N-linked motifs (N-X-S/T) were strikingly prevalent within ACPA (100%) compared to somatically hypermutated (SHM) RA bone marrow plasma cells (21%), and synovial plasma cells from seropositive (39%) and seronegative RA (7%). When normalized for SHM, ACPA still had significantly higher frequency of N-linked motifs compared to all studied mAbs including highly-mutated HIV broadly-neutralizing and malaria-associated mAbs. The Fab glycans of ACPA-mAbs were highly sialylated, contributed to altered charge, but did not influence antigen binding.

To understand the determinant for this situation, we constructed a mathematical model describing the transmission dynamics and natural history of COVID-19 and analyzed the dataset of fatal cases of COVID-19 in Italy, Spain, and Japan. We estimated the parameter which describes the age-dependency of susceptibility by fitting the model to reported data, taking into account the effect of change in contact patterns during the outbreak of COVID-19, and the fraction of symptomatic COVID-19 infections. Our modelling study revealed that if the mortality rate or the fraction of symptomatic infections among all COVID-19 cases does not depend on age, then unrealistically different age-dependencies of susceptibilities against COVID-19 infections between Italy, Japan, and Spain are required to explain the similar age distribution of mortality but different basic reproduction numbers (R0). Variation of susceptibility by age itself cannot explain the robust age distribution in mortality by COVID-19 in those three countries, however it does suggest that the age-dependencies of i) the mortality rate and ii) the fraction of symptomatic infections among all COVID-19 cases determine the age distribution of mortality by COVID-19.","Omori, R.; Matsuyama, R.; Nakata, Y.",,289,1

Arginine vasopressin (AVP) which is involve in the regulation of body osmotic system, body water content, blood pressure and plasma volume, that are highly disturbed in Covid-19 and linked with poor clinical outcomes. Therefore, this present study aimed to find the potential association between AVP serum level and inflammatory disorders in Covid-19. It has been observed by different recent studies that physiological response due to fever, pain, hypovolemia, dehydration, and psychological stress is characterized by activation release of AVP to counter-balance high blood viscosity in Covid-19 patients. In addition, activated immune cells mainly T and B lymphocytes and released pro-inflammatory cytokines stimulate discharge of stored AVP from immune cells, which in a vicious cycle trigger release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Vasopressin receptor antagonists have antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects that may inhibit AVP-induced hyponatremia and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines in Covid-19. In conclusion, release of AVP from hypothalamus is augmented in Covid-19 due to stress, high pro-inflammatory cytokines, high circulating AngII and inhibition of GABAergic neurons. In turn, high AVP level leads to induction of hyponatremia, inflammatory disorders, and development of complications in Covid-19 by activation of NF-κB and NLRP3 inflammasome with release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Therefore, AVP antagonists might be novel potential therapeutic modality in treating Covid-19 through mitigation of AVP-mediated inflammatory disorders and hyponatremia.","Al-kuraishy, Hayder M.; Al-Gareeb, Ali I.; Qusti, Safaa; Alshammari, Eida M.; Atanu, Francis O.; Batiha, Gaber El-Saber",Biomed Pharmacother,289,16

METHODS: We employed an explanatory sequential mixed methods design. First, we conducted a cross-sectional survey in patients (n=101) and professionals (n=47). Next, we conducted three focus groups with patients, family members and professionals (n=17). RESULTS: Of patients, 89.1% used ICT at least weekly for private communication. Patients reported relatively high comprehension of eHealth information ([Formula: see text] =6.7, 95% CI: 6.2 to 7.3, range 1–10), yet were less confident evaluating information reliability ([Formula: see text] =5.8, 95% CI: 5.1 to 6.4) and finding eHealth apps ([Formula: see text] =4.8, 95% CI: 4.2 to 5.4).

Focus groups revealed ‘considering non-ICT-accessible groups’ and ‘fitting patients’ and professionals’ technology’ as crucial for acceptability. In relation to understanding/appraising eHealth, participants highlighted that general SSc information is not tailored to individual’s disease course. Recommendations included ‘providing timely, understandable and safe information’ and ‘empowering end-users in ICT and health decision-making skills’. Professionals expressed concerns about lacking resources. Patients were concerned about data security and person-centredness. Key eHealth drivers included ‘addressing end-user perceptions’ and ‘putting people at the centre of technology’.

As such, it is unlikely to reflect the transcriptional complexity of the mouse species. Gene transcription is dynamic and condition-specific; therefore, to better understand the mouse transcriptional response to respiratory virus infection, we infected the eight founder strains of the Collaborative Cross with either influenza A virus or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and sequenced lung RNA samples at 2 and 4 days after infection. We found numerous instances of transcripts that were not present in the C57BL/6J reference annotation, indicating that a nontrivial proportion of the mouse genome is transcribed but poorly annotated. Of these novel transcripts, 2150 could be aligned to human or rat genomes, but not to existing mouse genomes, suggesting functionally conserved sequences not yet recorded in mouse genomes. We also found that respiratory virus infection induced differential expression of 4287 splicing junctions, resulting in strain-specific isoform expression. Of these, 59 were influenced by strain-specific mutations within 2 base pairs of key intron–exon boundaries, suggesting cis-regulated expression. Our results reveal the complexity of the transcriptional response to viral infection, previously undocumented genomic elements, and extensive diversity in the response across mouse strains.

The aim of this study was to determine the influence of saw blade frequency and contact load, bone condition, test environment, and saw blade type, on the production of aerosol particles. A custom test setup was designed, manufactured and used in 8 bone sawing experiments, using a particle counter to determine the production of aerosol particles while varying the 5 chosen parameters. The number of counted particles was highest with higher saw blade frequencies, lower saw blade contact loads, in dry completely skeletonized bone compared to fresh bone, and using an electrical oscillating saw compared to hand-sawing. Under all conditions, the high amount of aerosol counted posed potential health risks. The ventilation system that we tested was adequate in removing the produced particles, but these high-tech systems are not always available in developing countries or emergency situations. The production of aerosols can be reduced by optimizing the sawing parameters. However, even the lowest number of aerosol particles counted during the current study was high enough to cause potential health risks to practitioners. Safety precautions should be taken, such as external ventilation, proper breathing gear, and adequate protocols, to truly minimize the risk in all bone sawing scenarios.","Pluim, Jip M.

In the fight against this novel disease, there is a pressing need for rapid and effective screening tools to identify patients infected with COVID-19, and to this end CT imaging has been proposed as one of the key screening methods which may be used as a complement to RT-PCR testing, particularly in situations where patients undergo routine CT scans for non-COVID-19 related reasons, patients have worsening respiratory status or developing complications that require expedited care, or patients are suspected to be COVID-19-positive but have negative RT-PCR test results. Early studies on CT-based screening have reported abnormalities in chest CT images which are characteristic of COVID-19 infection, but these abnormalities may be difficult to distinguish from abnormalities caused by other lung conditions. Motivated by this, in this study we introduce COVIDNet-CT, a deep convolutional neural network architecture that is tailored for detection of COVID-19 cases from chest CT images via a machine-driven design exploration approach. Additionally, we introduce COVIDx-CT, a benchmark CT image dataset derived from CT imaging data collected by the China National Center for Bioinformation comprising 104,009 images across 1,489 patient cases. Furthermore, in the interest of reliability and transparency, we leverage an explainability-driven performance validation strategy to investigate the decision-making behavior of COVIDNet-CT, and in doing so ensure that COVIDNet-CT makes predictions based on relevant indicators in CT images. Both COVIDNet-CT and the COVIDx-CT dataset are available to the general public in an open-source and open access manner as part of the COVID-Net initiative. While COVIDNet-CT is not yet a production-ready screening solution, we hope that releasing the model and dataset will encourage researchers, clinicians, and citizen data scientists alike to leverage and build upon them.","Gunraj, Hayden; Wang, Linda; Wong, Alexander",Front Med (Lausanne),289,20

Owing to the current COVID-19 crisis, the value of telemedicine via videoconferencing is more recognized, particularly in allowing immobile patients to continue receiving care. However, the efficacy of telemedicine in home care settings in Japan remains to be fully appraised. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify the use and impact of telemedicine in a singular home care delivery setting in Japan. METHODS: A retrospective observational study was conducted using patient and other administrative records from a home care clinic. We considered patients who were involved in videoconferencing with home care physicians and telepresenters serving patients during 2018 and 2019. We extracted sociodemographic data of the patients and details of the videoconferencing and descriptively illustrated some specific cases. RESULTS: In a home care clinic in Japan, videoconferencing was conducted in 17 cases (involving 14 patients) over a 2-year period. Of all the cases, 12% (2/17) required emergency transfers and were hospitalized. A total of 88% (15/17) of cases remained; 71% (12/17) of cases were found to need extra medication or to go to a medical facility for consultation, whereas 18% (3/17) of cases were found not to be in need of urgent attention and were asked to rest. Problematic symptoms subsequently improved in 82% (14/17) of cases, and only 6% (1/17) of cases were later hospitalized. CONCLUSIONS: Telemedicine was deemed effective for assessing patients’ conditions in the home care setting in situations where home visits by a physician cannot be carried out. Our findings indicate that consultations via videoconferencing are safe and effective, suggesting more active use of videoconferencing in other clinical contexts.","Miyatake, Hirotomo; Kosaka, Makoto; Arita, Satoshi; Tsunetoshi, Chie; Masunaga, Hidehisa; Kotera, Yasuhiro; Nishikawa, Yoshitaka; Ozaki, Akihiko; Beniya, Hiroyuki",J Med Internet Res,289,17

Based on an ultrathin substrate, the biosensor offers a high level of mechanical durability and consistent sensing responses, while conforming to non-planar surfaces such as the human body and withstanding large deformations (e.g., bending and stretching). Moreover, a nonionic surfactant is employed to minimize the nonspecific adsorption of the biosensor, hence enabling cytokine detection (TNF-α and IFN-γ, significant inflammatory cytokines, are used as representatives) in artificial tears (used as a biofluid representative). The experimental results demonstrate that the biosensor very consistently and sensitively detects TNF-α and IFN-γ, with limits of detection down to 2.75 and 2.89 pM, respectively. The biosensor, which undergoes large deformations, can thus potentially provide a consistent and sensitive detection of cytokines in the human body.","Wang, Ziran; Hao, Zhuang; Yu, Shifeng; Huang, Cong; Pan, Yunlu; Zhao, Xuezeng",Nanomaterials (Basel),289,1

The objective of this study is to report the results from patients at Wuhan Children’s Hospital, located within the initial center of the outbreak. METHODS: Clinical, imaging, and laboratory data of 76 children were collected retrospectively and analyzed with the Fisher exact test and Cox regression statistical methods. RESULTS: Among 50 children with a positive COVID-19 real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR), five had negative PCR results initially but showed positive results in subsequent tests. Eight (16%) patients had lymphopenia, seven (14%) with thrombocytopenia, four (8%) with lymphocytosis, two (4%) with thrombocytosis, ten (20%) with elevated C-reactive protein, four (8%) with hemoglobin above, and six (12%) with below standard reference values. Seven (14%) of the 50 had no radiologic evidence of disease on chest CT. For the 43 patients who had abnormal CT findings, in addition to previously reported patterns of ground-glass opacity (67%), local patchy shadowing (37%), local bilateral patchy shadowing (21%), and lesion location of lower lobes (65%), other CT features include that an overwhelming number of pediatric patients had lesions in the subpleural area (95%) and 22 of the 28 lower lobe lesions were in the posterior segment (78%). Lesions in most of the 15 patients (67%) who received chest CT at discharge were not completely absorbed, and 26% of these pediatric patients had CT lesions that were either unchanged or worse. CONCLUSIONS: There were a few differences between COVID-19 children and COVID-19 adults in terms of laboratory findings and CT characteristics. CT is a powerful tool to detect and characterize COVID-19 pneumonia but has little utility in evaluating clinical recovery for children. These results oppose current COVID-19 hospital discharge criteria in China, as one requirement is that pulmonary imaging must show significant lesion absorption prior to discharge. These differences between pediatric and adult cases of COVID-19 may necessitate pediatric-specific discharge criteria.","Ma, Huijing; Hu, Jiani; Tian, Jie; Zhou, Xi; Li, Hui; Laws, Maxwell Thomas; Wesemann, Luke David; Zhu, Baiqi; Chen, Wei; Ramos, Rafael; Xia, Jun; Shao, Jianbo",BMC Med,289,16

In this article, a modified version of the well known mathematical epidemic model Susceptible (S)- Infected (I)- Recovered (R) is used to analyze the epidemic's course of COVID-19 in eight different countries of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC). To achieve this goal, the parameters of the SIR model are identified by using publicly available data for the corresponding countries: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Based on the prediction model we estimated the epidemic trend of COVID-19 outbreak in SAARC countries for 20 days, 90 days, and 180 days respectively.

The maximum and minimum basic reproduction number (R0 = 1.33 and 1.07) for SAARC countries are predicted to be in Pakistan and Bhutan. We equate simulation results with real data in the SAARC countries on the COVID-19 outbreak, and model potential countermeasure implementation scenarios.

Those who develop persistent post-concussion symptoms often benefit from early recognition and referral to multi-disciplinary concussion clinics that have the personnel and resources to meet their complex needs. Youth who live in remote and isolated communities within Canada’s North, a significant proportion of whom are Indigenous, face unique barriers and obstacles to accessing primary and specialised concussion care. Although telemedicine has recently emerged as a tool that can help address these gaps in care, there are presently no clinical guidelines or tools available to assist multi-disciplinary concussion clinics in providing remote concussion care to these medically underserved patients. Here we incorporate literature from a scoping review and our early institutional experience to present an evidence-informed preliminary clinical algorithm and resources to help guide and optimise remote paediatric concussion care delivery in Canada’s North.

The S protein is the Trojan horse of coronaviruses, mediating their entry into the host cells. While SARS-CoV-2 was becoming a global threat, scientists have been accumulating data on the virus at an impressive pace, both in terms of genomic sequences and of three-dimensional structures. On April 21st, the GISAID resource had collected 10,823 SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences. We extracted from them all the complete S protein sequences and identified point mutations thereof. Six mutations were located on a 14-residue segment (929-943) in the “fusion core” of the heptad repeat 1 (HR1). Our modeling in the pre- and post-fusion S protein conformations revealed, for three of them, the loss of interactions stabilizing the post-fusion assembly. On May 29th, the SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences in GISAID were 34,805. An analysis of the occurrences of the HR1 mutations in this updated dataset revealed a significant increase for the S929I and S939F mutations and a dramatic increase for the D936Y mutation, which was particularly widespread in Sweden and Wales/England. We notice that this is also the mutation causing the loss of a strong inter-monomer interaction, the D936-R1185 salt bridge, thus clearly weakening the post-fusion assembly.","Cavallo, Luigi; Oliva, Romina",bioRxiv,289,16

Design. Secondary data analysis Using county-level data for 3,142 US counties was conducted in 2020. Hierarchical linear regression and concentration curve analyses were performed. The combined association of COVID-19 cases and deaths was examined separately by sociodemographic and economic characteristics of the county population. Data from the American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year estimates (2014-2018), Area Health Resources File (AHRF) 2018-2019, and 2020 COVID-19 data from Johns Hopkins University were used in this study. Results. After adjusting for covariates, US counties with a higher proportion of the black population, and a higher proportion of adults with less than high school diploma had disproportionately higher COVID-19 cases and deaths ({beta}>0, p<0.05). A higher proportion of the Hispanic population was associated with higher confirmed cases ({beta}= 1.03, 95% CI= 0.57-1.5), and higher housing cost to household income ratio was associated with higher deaths ({beta}= 3.74, 95% CI= 2.14-5.37).

Environ Microbiol 21: 1513‐1528). The current coronavirus pandemic is a stark example of why microbiology literacy is such a crucial enabler of informed policy decisions, particularly those involving preparedness of public‐health systems for disease outbreaks and pandemics. However, a significant barrier to attaining widespread appreciation of microbial contributions to our well‐being and that of the planet is the fact that microbes are seldom visible: most people are only peripherally aware of them, except when they fall ill with an infection. And it is disease, rather than all of the positive activities mediated by microbes, that colours public perception of ‘germs’ and endows them with their poor image. It is imperative to render microbes visible, to give them life and form for children (and adults), and to counter prevalent misconceptions, through exposure to imagination‐capturing images of microbes and examples of their beneficial outputs, accompanied by a balanced narrative. This will engender automatic mental associations between everyday information inputs, as well as visual, olfactory and tactile experiences, on the one hand, and the responsible microbes/microbial communities, on the other hand. Such associations, in turn, will promote awareness of microbes and of the many positive and vital consequences of their actions, and facilitate and encourage incorporation of such consequences into relevant decision‐making processes. While teaching microbiology topics in primary and secondary school is key to this objective, a strategic programme to expose children directly and personally to natural and managed microbial processes, and the results of their actions, through carefully planned class excursions to local venues, can be instrumental in bringing microbes to life for children and, collaterally, their families. In order to encourage the embedding of microbiology‐centric class excursions in current curricula, we suggest and illustrate here some possibilities relating to the topics of food (a favourite pre‐occupation of most children), agriculture (together with horticulture and aquaculture), health and medicine, the environment and biotechnology. And, although not all of the microbially relevant infrastructure will be within reach of schools, there is usually access to a market, local food store, wastewater treatment plant, farm, surface water body, etc., all of which can provide opportunities to explore microbiology in action. If children sometimes consider the present to be mundane, even boring, they are usually excited with both the past and the future so, where possible, visits to local museums (the past) and research institutions advancing knowledge frontiers (the future) are strongly recommended, as is a tapping into the natural enthusiasm of local researchers to leverage the educational value of excursions and virtual excursions. Children are also fascinated by the unknown, so, paradoxically, the invisibility of microbes makes them especially fascinating objects for visualization and exploration. In outlining some of the options for microbiology excursions, providing suggestions for discussion topics and considering their educational value, we strive to extend the vistas of current class excursions and to: (i) inspire teachers and school managers to incorporate more microbiology excursions into curricula; (ii) encourage microbiologists to support school excursions and generally get involved in bringing microbes to life for children; (iii) urge leaders of organizations (biopharma, food industries, universities, etc.) to give school outreach activities a more prominent place in their mission portfolios, and (iv) convey to policymakers the benefits of providing schools with funds, materials and flexibility for educational endeavours beyond the classroom.","McGenity, Terry J.; Gessesse, Amare; Hallsworth, John E.; Garcia Cela, Esther; Verheecke‐Vaessen, Carol; Wang, Fengping; Chavarría, Max; Haggblom, Max M.; Molin, Søren; Danchin, Antoine; Smid, Eddy J.; Lood, Cédric; Cockell, Charles S.; Whitby, Corinne; Liu, Shuang‐Jiang; Keller, Nancy P.; Stein, Lisa Y.; Bordenstein, Seth R.; Lal, Rup; Nunes, Olga C.; Gram, Lone; Singh, Brajesh K.; Webster, Nicole S.; Morris, Cindy; Sivinski, Sharon; Bindschedler, Saskia; Junier, Pilar; Antunes, André; Baxter, Bonnie K.; Scavone, Paola; Timmis, Kenneth",Microb Biotechnol,289,16

However, current studies on respiration flow and the resulted exhaled pollutant dispersion are limited, because different head postures, respiration mode, breath rate, room ventilation and so on, can exert profound impacts that are not understood very clearly. To evaluate the role of head postures on transmission of human exhaled pollutants, this study uses a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) program to study the exhalation flow of a sitting adult in a calm indoor office. Four different head postures are considered: sitting upright viewing front, sitting upright but head tilted viewing upward, sitting upright but head turned viewing the lateral, and sitting but pillowing head on a table. Based on the decay percentage of a gas concentration, the impacted scope of expired air is identified. The common posture by sitting upright viewing front is selected to investigate the change of impacted scope with increasing exhalation rates. The experimental test is also carried out using a breathing thermal manikin. This study finds out that the impacted scope of expired air under different head postures is different. The horizontal impacted distance is highly dependent on the specified threshold concentration. If a person sits around at a table and makes a deep exhalation, other people shall be apart from him/her with a larger distance to be free from the exhaled pollutant exposure, once his/her thermal plume is blocked by the table.","Zhang, Tengfei (Tim); Yin, Shi; Wang, Shugang",Build Environ,289,16

We present seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and correlates of seropositivity immediately after the first wave. METHODS: From a serosurvey of adult NYC residents (May 13-July 21, 2020), we calculated the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies stratified by participant demographics, symptom history, health status, and employment industry. We used multivariable regression models to assess associations between participant characteristics and seropositivity. RESULTS: Seroprevalence among 45,367 participants was 23.6% (95% CI, 23.2%-24.0%). High seroprevalence (>30%) was observed among Black and Hispanic individuals, people from high poverty neighborhoods, and people in health care or essential worker industry sectors. COVID-19 symptom history was associated with seropositivity (adjusted relative risk=2.76; 95% CI, 2.65-2.88). Other risk factors included sex, age, race/ethnicity, residential area, employment sector, working outside the home, contact with a COVID-19 case, obesity, and increasing numbers of household members. CONCLUSIONS: Based on a large serosurvey in a single U.S. jurisdiction, we estimate that just under one-quarter of NYC adults were infected in the first few months of the COVID-19 epidemic. Given disparities in infection risk, effective interventions for at-risk groups are needed during ongoing transmission.","Pathela, Preeti; Crawley, Addie; Weiss, Don; Maldin, Beth; Cornell, Jennifer; Purdin, Jeff; Schumacher, Pamela K; Marovich, Stacey; Li, Joyce; Daskalakis, Demetre",J Infect Dis,289,16

An uncontrolled fire in an adjacent warehouse ignited ~2,750 tons of Ammonium Nitrate (AN), producing one of the most devastating blasts in recent history. The blast supersonic pressure and heat wave claimed the lives of 220 people and injured more than 6,500 instantaneously, with severe damage to the nearby dense residential and commercial areas. This review represents one of the in-depth reports to provide a detailed analysis of the Beirut blast and its health and environmental implications. It further reviews prior AN incidents and suggests actionable recommendations and strategies to optimize chemical safety measures, improve emergency preparedness, and mitigate the delayed clinical effects of blast and toxic gas exposures. These recommended actionable steps offer a starting point for government officials and policymakers to build frameworks, adopt regulations, and implement chemical safety protocols to ensure safe storage of hazardous materials as well as reorganizing healthcare system disaster preparedness to improve emergency preparedness in response to similar large-scale disasters and promote population safety. Future clinical efforts should involve detailed assessment of physical injuries sustained by blast victims, with systemic mitigation and possible treatment of late blast effects involving individuals, communities and the region at large.","Al-Hajj, Samar; Dhaini, Hassan R.; Mondello, Stefania; Kaafarani, Haytham; Kobeissy, Firas; DePalma, Ralph G.",Front Public Health,289,26

This study aimed to describe the clinical features of COVID-19 in rheumatic patients and provide information for handling this situation in clinical practice. METHODS: This is a retrospective case series study. Deidentified data, including gender, age, laboratory and radiological results, symptoms, signs, and medication history, were collected from 2326 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, including 21 cases in combination with rheumatic disease, in Tongji Hospital between 13 January and 15 March 2020. RESULTS: Length of hospital stay and mortality rate were similar between rheumatic and non-rheumatic groups, while the presence of respiratory failure was more common in rheumatic cases (38% vs 10%, p<0.001). Symptoms of fever, fatigue and diarrhoea were seen in 76%, 43% and 23% of patients, respectively. There were four rheumatic patients who experienced a flare of rheumatic disease during hospital stay, with symptoms of muscle aches, back pain, joint pain or rash. While lymphocytopaenia was seen in 57% of rheumatic patients, only one patient (5%) presented with leucopenia in rheumatic cases. Rheumatic patients presented with similar radiological features of ground-glass opacity and consolidation. Patients with pre-existing interstitial lung disease showed massive fibrous stripes and crazy-paving signs at an early stage. Five rheumatic cases used hydroxychloroquine before the diagnosis of COVID-19 and none progressed to critically ill stage. CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory failure was more common in rheumatic patients infected with COVID-19. Differential diagnosis between COVID-19 and a flare of rheumatic disease should be considered.

However, depending on the assay system, cross-reactivity between viruses that share a high sequence homology as well as detection of rare virus isolates with sequence variations can be problematic. Virus sequence-independent metagenomic high-throughput sequencing allows for accurate detection of all virus species in a given sample, as we demonstrate here for human Enterovirus and Rhinovirus in a lung transplant patient. While early in infection a commercial PCR assay recorded Rhinovirus, high-throughput sequencing correctly identified human Enterovirus C104 as the source of infection, highlighting the potential of the technology and the benefit of applying open assay formats in complex diagnostic situations.","Lewandowska, Dagmara W.; Zagordi, Osvaldo; Zbinden, Andrea; Schuurmans, Macé M.; Schreiber, Peter; Geissberger, Fabienne-Desirée; Huder, Jon B.; Böni, Jürg; Benden, Christian; Mueller, Nicolas J.; Trkola, Alexandra; Huber, Michael",Diagnostic Microbiology and Infectious Disease,289,28

Fomsgaard et al 2020 recently presented results using heat-processing of respiratory samples prior to RT-qPCR as an economical method enabling an extremely fast streamlining of the processes at virtually no cost. Here, we present our results using this method and highlight some major pitfalls that diagnostics laboratories should be aware of before proceeding with this technique. We first investigated various treatments using different temperatures, incubation times and sample volumes based on the above study to optimise the heat-treatment conditions. Although the initial data confirmed the published results, further investigations revealed unexpected inhibitory properties of some commonly used virus transport media (VTMs) on some commercially available RT-qPCR mixes, emphasising the critical importance of a thorough validation process to determine the most adapted reagents to be used depending on the sample types to be tested. In conclusion, although the method works, with very consistent Ct values and an excellent sensitivity when compared to a conventional RNA extraction method, it is critical to include an internal control to check each sample for potential inhibition.","Calvez, R.

This research seeks to understand how the COVID-19 event leads to impacts, lessons, and proposed solutions for the operations of global supply chains. This study is based on a structured review of publications released on or before 31 December 2020. It includes established academic publications but also those emerging primarily from academic institutions in trade magazines and on the wider internet. Specifically, four research questions are addressed: How and where are disruptions caused by COVID-19 understood to impact global supply chains? How does the literature portray supply chain lessons from the COVID-19-related disruptions? How does the literature portray the suggested resilience-driven solutions for the future operation of global supply chains? Finally, how are digital technologies proposed as part of resilience-driven solutions to the future operation of global supply chains? Concerning the findings, the study contributes by developing a new theoretical understanding of the ongoing collective supply chain lessons of the COVID-19 disruption. Six supply chain vulnerabilities, six solutions or resilience capabilities and seven technology clusters deemed particularly useful in mitigating future pandemic disruptions are identified. In addition, the interrelationships between the different elements are explored and understood as an ongoing learning process comprising a process of evoking vulnerabilities, a process of reacting and devising change and a process of implementing change. Based on these findings, a set of managerial implications and avenues for future research are proposed.","Hald, Kim Sundtoft; Coslugeanu, Paula",Oper Manag Res,289,24

Typically, these models use statistical predictive methods to capture the structure of the underlying stochastic process without taking into consideration estimation errors and model misspecification. In this context, we propose a data-driven prescriptive analytics framework aiming to integrate the machine learning and dynamic optimization machinery in a consistent and efficient way to build a bridge from data to decisions. The proposed framework tackles a relevant class of dynamic decision problems comprising many important practical applications. The basic building blocks of our proposed framework are: (1) a Hidden Markov Model as a predictive (machine learning) method to represent uncertainty; and (2) a distributionally robust dynamic optimization model as a prescriptive method that takes into account estimation errors associated with the predictive model and allows for control of the risk associated with decisions. Moreover, we present an evaluation framework to assess out-of-sample performance in rolling horizon schemes. A complete case study on dynamic asset allocation illustrates the proposed framework showing superior out-of-sample performance against selected benchmarks. The numerical results show the practical importance and applicability of the proposed framework since it extracts valuable information from data to obtain robustified decisions with an empirical certificate of out-of-sample performance evaluation.","Silva, Thuener; Valladão, Davi; Homem-de-Mello, Tito",Comput Optim Appl,289,1

Despite its worldwide occurrence, little is known on the pathogenesis of HBoV infections. In addition, few systematic studies of HBoV in ARI have been conducted in Latin America. Therefore, in order to test whether active viral replication of human bocavirus is associated with respiratory diseases and to understand the clinical impact of this virus in patients with these diseases, we performed a 3-year retrospective hospital-based study of HBoV in outpatients and inpatients with symptoms of Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI) in Brazil. Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) from 1015 patients with respiratory symptoms were tested for HBoV DNA by PCR. All samples positive for HBoV were tested by PCR for all other respiratory viruses, had HBoV viral loads determined by quantitative real time PCR and, when possible, were tested by RT-PCR for HBoV VP1 mRNA, as evidence of active viral replication. HBoV was detected in 4.8% of patients, with annual rates of 10.0%, 3.0% and 3.0% in 2005, 2006 and 2007, respectively. The range of respiratory symptoms was similar between HBoV-positive and HBoV-negative ARI patients. However, a higher rate of diarrhea was observed in HBoV-positive patients. High HBoV viral loads (>10(8) copies/mL) and diarrhea were significantly more frequent in patients with exclusive infection by HBoV and in patients with detection of HBoV VP1 mRNA than in patients with viral co-infection, detected in 72.9% of patients with HBoV. In summary, our data demonstrated that active HBoV replication was detected in a small percentage of patients with ARI and was correlated with concurrent diarrhea and lack of other viral co-infections.","Proença-Modena, José Luiz; Gagliardi, Talita Bianca; Escremim de Paula, Flávia; Iwamoto, Marisa Akiko; Criado, Miriã Ferreira; Camara, Ataíde A.; Acrani, Gustavo Olszanski; Cintra, Otávio Augusto Leite; Cervi, Maria Célia; de Paula Arruda, Luisa Karla; Arruda, Eurico",PLoS One,289,32

Here, we describe a screening pipeline for the discovery of efficacious SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors. We screen a best-in-class drug repurposing library, ReFRAME, against two high-throughput, high-content imaging infection assays: one using HeLa cells expressing SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 and the other using lung epithelial Calu-3 cells. From nearly 12,000 compounds, we identify 49 (in HeLa-ACE2) and 41 (in Calu-3) compounds capable of selectively inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 replication. Notably, most screen hits are cell-line specific, likely due to different virus entry mechanisms or host cell-specific sensitivities to modulators. Among these promising hits, the antivirals nelfinavir and the parent of prodrug MK-4482 possess desirable in vitro activity, pharmacokinetic and human safety profiles, and both reduce SARS-CoV-2 replication in an orthogonal human differentiated primary cell model. Furthermore, MK-4482 effectively blocks SARS-CoV-2 infection in a hamster model.

At the end of February, the outburst of the pandemic has hit hard on northern Italian's hospitals. As of today, no data have been published regarding the severity of respiratory failure of patients presenting to the Emergency Departments. Moreover, the outcome the patients forced to undergo Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) or Non-Invasive Positive Pressure Ventilation (NIPPV) due to lack of Intensive Care resources is unknown. “Papa Giovanni XXIII” hospital (HPG23) of Bergamo is one of the largest hospitals in the Country, with an Emergency Department (ED) managing over 100,000 patients per year. METHODS: This is a retrospective observational study based on chart review of patients presenting to the Emergency Department of HPG23 from 29/02/2020 to 10/03/2020 with a clinical condition highly suspicious for COVID-19 infection. Registration of admission rates, severity of respiratory failure (ARDS classification), need of respiratory support, SARS-CoV-2 PCR test and outcome of patients treated with a ventilatory support were registered on 10th of May 2020. FINDINGS: From 29/02 to 10/03 611 patients with a suspected diagnosis of COVID-19 infection were evaluated in our ED; 320 (52%) met the criteria for hospital admission and 99 (31%) needed to be immediately started on ventilatory support (81% CPAP, 7% NIPPV, 12% Invasive Mechanical Ventilation). Eighty-five (86%) of the 99 patients needing a ventilatory support eventually had SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by PCR test on nasal-pharyngeal swab. Their median PO2/FiO2 ratio was 128 (IQR 85–168), with 23 patients (29.5%) classified as severe ARDS. Mortality rate as of 10th of May was 76.5%, ranging from 44.4% within patients <60 years old to 85% within those older than 60 years (p = 0.001). NIPPV/CPAP failure occurred in 91.5% of patients. INTERPRETATION: The population of patients suspected for COVID-19 infection presenting at our ED showed a very high rate of severe respiratory failure, with urgent need of a large amount of intensive care resources. Mortality rates of critically ill patients with confirmed COVID-19 (76.5%) are similar to previously reported studies with similar population.

Cytokine storm is a major cause of new coronavirus death. The purpose of this study was to explore the effects of antiviral drug arbidol on cytokine storm and pulmonary fibrosis. Here, we use a mouse model of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis and a mouse model of fecal dilution-induced sepsis to evaluate the effects of arbidol on pulmonary fibrosis and cytokine storm. The results showed that arbidol significantly reduced the area of pulmonary fibrosis and improved lung function (reduced inspiratory resistance, lung dynamic compliance and forced vital capacity increased). Treatment with arbidol promoted reduced sepsis severity 48 h after sepsis induction, based on weight, murine sepsis score and survival rate. Arbidol observably alleviates inflammatory infiltrates and injury in the lungs and liver. Finally, we also found that arbidol reduced serum levels of pro-inflammatory factors such as TNF-α and IL-6 induced by fecal dilution. In conclusion, our results indicate that arbidol can alleviate the severity of pulmonary fibrosis and sepsis, and provide some reference for the treatment of cytokine storm and sequelae of pulmonary fibrosis in patients with COVID-19.","Li, Hailong; Liu, Rui; Zhang, Ruotong; Zhang, Shanshan; Wei, Yiying; Zhang, Liang; Zhou, Honggang; Yang, Cheng",Front Pharmacol,289,1

The pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus-2 (SARS COV-2)(COVID-19) is transmitted by aerosol and droplet spread. Due to its virulence, there is a risk of transmission to healthcare workers if appropriate preventive measures are not taken. COVID-19 patients may show no clinical signs at the early stages of the disease or even remain asymptomatic for the whole course of the disease. Despite the lack of symptoms, they may be able to transfer the virus. Unfortunately, current COVID-19 testing procedures around 30% of tests are associated with a false negative result.

Live attenuated vaccines are traditionally generated by serial passage of a virulent strain in embryonated chicken eggs; however, the molecular mechanism of attenuation is unknown. M41-CK, a virulent lab-adapted strain of IBV, was egg passaged over 100 times in four parallel independent replicates. All four final egg-passaged viruses were attenuated in vivo and exhibited similar growth phenotypes in adult chicken kidney cells and ex vivo tracheal organ cultures. The virus populations were sequenced by 454 pyrosequencing at the end of passaging, and the results showed that overall sequence diversity in the IBV population increased but the four replicates only had between 11 and 17 consensus-level single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Although hot spots of variation were identified in spike and nucleocapsid structural proteins as well as the 3ʹ untranslated region, each attenuated virus possessed a different pattern of genomic variation. Overall, only a small number of consensus-level SNPs were acquired during egg passage, leaving a potentially short route back to virulence. These results highlight the unpredictable nature of attenuation by serial egg passage and the need to develop mechanisms to rationally attenuate IBV for the next generation of effective vaccines. IMPORTANCE Infectious bronchitis remains a major problem in the global poultry industry, despite the existence of many different vaccines. IBV vaccines are currently developed by serial passage of a virulent strain on embryonated hen’s eggs until attenuation; however, little is known about the evolution of the viral population during the process of attenuation. High-throughput sequencing of four replicates of a serially egg-passaged IBV revealed a different pattern of genomic variation in each attenuated replicate and few consensus-level SNPs. This raises concerns that only a small number of genomic mutations are required to revert to a virulent phenotype, which may result in vaccine breakdown in the field. The observed hot spots of variation in the attenuated viruses have the potential to be used in the rational attenuation of virulent IBV for next-generation vaccine design.","Oade, Michael S.; Keep, Sarah; Freimanis, Graham L.; Orton, Richard J.; Britton, Paul; Hammond, John A.; Bickerton, Erica",J Virol,289,1

Overall, we find that municipalities in the Midwest and South on average out-performed those in the Northeast and West in terms of both efficiency and productivity, and both before and after the financial crisis.","O’Loughlin, Caitlin T.; Wilson, Paul W.",Empir Econ,289,20

In the smartphone era a population can be immune to epidemics even if not a single one of its members is immune to the disease - a notion we propose to call ""digital herd immunity"", which is similarly an emergent characteristic of the population. This immunity arises because contact-tracing protocols based on smartphone capabilities can lead to highly efficient quarantining of infected population members and thus the extinguishing of nascent epidemics. When the disease characteristics are favorable and smartphone usage is high enough, the population is in this immune phase. As usage decreases there is a novel ""contact tracing"" phase transition to an epidemic phase. We present and study a simple branching-process model for COVID-19 and show that digital immunity is possible regardless of the proportion of non-symptomatic transmission. We believe this is a promising strategy for dealing with COVID-19 in many countries such as India, whose challenges of scale motivated us to undertake this study in the first place and whose case we discuss briefly.","Bulchandani, Vir Bannerjee; Shivam, Saumya; Moudgalya, Sanjay; Sondhi, S L",,289,20

A major priority is to distinguish transient and self-limited demyelinating syndromes like disseminated encephalomyelitis (DEM), from life-long diseases like multiple sclerosis (MS). However, the term DEM has been inconsistently applied across studies due to the lack of clear clinical and neuroimaging diagnostic criteria. The present review summarizes the available literature on DEM in children, outlines the main clinical and neuroimaging features at presentation, pathogenesis and outcome, and its differentiation from other conditions with acute impact in the CNS. The recently proposed clinical definitions for monophasic disseminated encephalomyelitis and its relapsing variants are discussed, and controversies surrounding the diagnosis of MS in children are addressed.","Tenembaum, Silvia N.",Clin Neurol Neurosurg,289,1

International preparedness to manage imported cases Ebola virus infection was inadequate, highlighted by cases of nosocomial transmission. Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a re-emerging tick-borne VHF centred in the Eurasian region, affecting a large geographical area and with human-to-human transmission reported, especially in the healthcare setting. OBJECTIVES: To systematically review the characteristics of travel associated Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever. METHODS: A systematic review of travel-associated cases of CCHF was performed following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement protocol. PubMed, SCOPUS, Science Citation Index (SCI) and ProMED databases were searched for reports published between January 1960 and January 2016. Three independent reviewers selected and reviewed studies and extracted data. RESULTS: 21 cases of travel associated CCHF were identified, of which 12 died (3 outcome unknown) and 4 secondary (nosocomial) infections were reported. Risk occupations or activities for CCHF infection were reported in 8/12 cases when data were available. Travel from Asia to Asia occurred in 9 cases, Africa to Africa occurred in 5 cases, Africa to Europe in 3 cases, Asia to Europe in 2 cases and Europe to Europe in 2 cases. CONCLUSION: CCHF related to travel is rare, is generally associated with at risk activities/occupation and is frequently fatal. Key to early diagnosis and prevention of nosocomial transmission is an understanding of CCHF risk factors and the geographical distribution of CCHF. International travel to CCHF endemic areas is increasing and clinicians and laboratory personnel managing returning travellers should maintain a high index of suspicion.","Leblebicioglu, Hakan; Ozaras, Resat; Fletcher, Tom E.; Beeching, Nick J.",Travel Med Infect Dis,289,3

The ability to control and regulate these processes is therefore important for analysis of infection process. Viruses are also useful tools in bio- and gene technology; they can efficiently kill cancer cells and trigger immune responses to tumors. However, the methods for constructing tissue- or cell-type specific viruses typically suffer from low target-cell specificity and a high risk of reversion. Therefore novel and universal methods of regulation of viral infection are also important for therapeutic application of virus-based systems. METHODS: Aberrantly spliced introns were introduced into crucial gene-expression units of adenovirus vector and alphavirus DNA/RNA layered vectors and their effects on the viral gene expression, replication and/or the release of infectious genomes were studied in cell culture. Transfection of the cells with splice-switching oligonucleotides was used to correct the introduced functional defect(s). RESULTS: It was demonstrated that viral gene expression, replication and/or the release of infectious genomes can be blocked by the introduction of aberrantly spliced introns. The insertion of such an intron into an adenovirus vector reduced the expression of the targeted gene more than fifty-fold. A similar insertion into an alphavirus DNA/RNA layered vector had a less dramatic effect; here, only the release of the infectious transcript was suppressed but not the subsequent replication and spread of the virus. However the insertion of two aberrantly spliced introns resulted in an over one hundred-fold reduction in the infectivity of the DNA/RNA layered vector. Furthermore, in both systems the observed effects could be reverted by the delivery of splice-switching oligonucleotide(s), which corrected the splicing defects. CONCLUSIONS: Splice-switch technology, originally developed for genetic disease therapy, can also be used to control gene expression of viral vectors. This approach represents a novel, universal and powerful method for controlling gene expression, replication, viral spread and, by extension, virus-induced cytotoxic effects and can be used both for basic studies of virus infection and in virus-based gene- and anti-cancer therapy.","Viru, Liane; Heller, Gregory; Lehto, Taavi; Pärn, Kalle; El Andaloussi, Samir; Langel, Ülo; Merits, Andres",Virol J,289,32

Targeted detection methods have a limited ability to detect unknown viruses and often provide insufficient data to detect coinfections or identify antigenic variants. Random, deep sequencing is a method that can more fully detect and characterize RNA viruses and is often coupled with molecular techniques or culture methods for viral enrichment. Viral culture coupled with third-generation sequencing were tested for the ability to detect and characterize RNA viruses. Cultures of bovine viral diarrhea virus, canine distemper virus, epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus, infectious bronchitis virus, two influenza A viruses, and porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus were sequenced on the MinION platform using a random, reverse primer in a strand-switching reaction, coupled with PCR-based barcoding. Reads were taxonomically classified and used for reference-based sequence building using a stock personal computer. This method accurately detected and identified complete coding sequence genomes with a minimum of 20× coverage depth for all seven viruses, including a sample containing two viruses. Each lineage-typing region had at least 26× coverage depth for all viruses. Furthermore, analyzing the canine distemper virus sample through a pipeline devoid of canine distemper virus reference sequences modeled the ability of this protocol to detect unknown viruses. These results show the ability of this technique to detect and characterize dsRNA, negative- and positive-sense ssRNA, nonsegmented, and segmented RNA viruses.","Young, Kelsey T.; Lahmers, Kevin K.; Sellers, Holly S.; Stallknecht, David E.; Poulson, Rebecca L.; Saliki, Jerry T.; Tompkins, S.

Herein, we analyzed differences in the antibody response elicited by inoculation of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine through a peptide-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) that utilizes synthetic peptides derived from the spike protein in the immuno-adsorbent phase. Immunoreactivity against synthetic peptides was measured at different time points from vaccination and was also correlated with the SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing capacity. Our results indicate that all vaccinated subjects except one show reactive antibodies to at least one peptide at both 30 and 60 days after injection of the first dose. Only one of the 19 analyzed subjects showed no antibody response toward any of the selected peptides, consistently with a lower neutralizing capacity. More importantly, our data showed that the antibody response elicited by inoculation of the two doses of the Pfizer vaccine appears to be qualitatively individual, both in the type of recognized peptides and in the temporal persistence of the antibody response. Together with previous published data, our findings suggest that for effective pandemic control, it is important to constantly monitor the antibody protection in the population, and the assay described here could be a valid tool for this purpose.","Polvere, Immacolata; Voccola, Serena; Parrella, Alfredina; Cardinale, Gaetano; Zerillo, Lucrezia; Varricchio, Romualdo; Madera, Jessica Raffaella; Stilo, Romania; Vito, Pasquale; Zotti, Tiziana",Vaccines (Basel),289,29

Antibody detection plays an important role in the diagnosis of COVID‐19. Here, we established a new time‐resolved fluorescence immunoassay (TRFIA) to determine COVID‐19 total antibodies. A double‐antigen sandwich TRFIA was optimized and established: recombinant nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (N protein) and spike protein (S protein) of COVID‐19 immobilized on 96‐well plates captured human COVID‐19 antibodies and then banded together with the N/S proteins labeled with europium(III) (Eu(3+)) chelates, and finally, time‐resolved fluorometry was used to measure the fluorescence values. We successfully established a TRFIA method for the detection of human COVID‐19 total antibodies, and the cutoff value was 2.02. There was no cross‐reactivity with the negative reference of the National Reference Panel for IgM and IgG antibodies to COVID‐19. The CV of the precision assay was 3.19%, and the assay could be stored stably for 15 days at 37°C. Compared with that of the colloidal gold method and chemiluminescence method, the sensitivity of the TRFIA method was higher, and the false positive/negative rate was lower. This established TRFIA has high sensitivity, accuracy, and specificity, which indicates that this method provides a new detection method for the high‐throughput routine diagnosis of COVID‐19.","Xu, Yunjian; Chen, Cuicui; Lai, Hongrui; He, Ying; Guo, Guiling; Feng, Jianming; Li, Laiqing",Biotechnol Appl Biochem,289,29

The neurorehabilitation centres of the Fundacio Esclerosi Multiple (FEM) provide care for people diagnosed with neuroprogressive diseases with significant health deficits. We look at how lockdown can affect their way of life. AIMS: To assess and manage the impact of lockdown on persons with multiple sclerosis (MS) and other neurodegenerative diseases. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Analytical observational study. An anonymous questionnaire was administered to all the patients undergoing comprehensive rehabilitation treatment at two of the FEM centres; the survey included questions on the demographic and clinical characteristics of the subjects, and an assessment of the impact of the pandemic on the physical, social and psychological spheres. RESULTS: A total of 202 surveys were analysed. The average age of the participants was 49.09 years and 77.8% had MS, while 22.2% had other conditions. The most frequently reported physical symptoms were muscle weakness, loss of balance and fatigue. The study population remained active during lockdown. More than half of them did not report any increase in cognitive symptoms, but they did mention an increased sense of worry on an emotional level. CONCLUSIONS: We can state that the actions deployed by the FEM to reduce the consequences of lockdown have been effective and have minimised the occurrence of maladaptive behaviours. The study has also opened the door for us to add new lines of intervention.","Zabay-Neiro, M C; Nieves-Collado, M; Carrés-Gonzalez, G; Curto-Estupiñà, G; Gargallo-Noval, M; Martínez-Lerín, N; Torres-Calvo, S; Yaya-Tur, G",Rev Neurol,289,32

Management of severe acute asthma in ICUs is less well studied, and variations in management may delay escalation and/or deescalation of therapies and increase length of stay. In order to standardize the management of severe acute asthma in our PICU, a nurse- and respiratory therapist–driven critical care asthma pathway was designed, implemented, and tested. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study of severe acute asthma at baseline followed by implementation of a critical care asthma pathway. SETTING: Twenty-six–bed urban quaternary PICU within a children’s hospital. PATIENTS: Patients 24 months to 18 years old admitted to the PICU in status asthmaticus. Patients with severe bacterial infections, chronic lung disease, heart disease, or immune disorders were excluded. INTERVENTIONS: Implementation of a nurse- and respiratory therapist–driven respiratory scoring tool and critical care asthma pathway with explicit escalation/deescalation instructions. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Primary outcome was PICU length of stay. Secondary outcomes were time to resolution of symptoms and hospital length of stay. Compliance approached 90% for respiratory score documentation and critical care asthma pathway adherence. Severity of illness at admission and clinical baseline characteristics were comparable in both groups. Pre intervention, the median ICU length of stay was 2 days (interquartile range, 1–3 d) with an overall hospital length of stay of 4 days (interquartile range, 3–6 d) (n = 74). After implementation of the critical care asthma pathway, the ICU length of stay was 1 day (interquartile range, 1–2 d) (p = 0.0013; n = 78) with an overall length of stay of 3 days (interquartile range, 2–3.75 d) (p < 0.001). The time to resolution of symptoms was reduced from a median of 66.5 hours in the preintervention group to 21 hours in the postintervention compliant group (p = 0.036). CONCLUSIONS: The use of a structured critical care asthma pathway, driven by an ICU nurse and respiratory therapist, is associated with faster resolution of symptoms, decreased ICU, and overall hospital lengths of stay in children admitted to an ICU for severe acute asthma.","Miksa, Michael; Kaushik, Shubhi; Antovert, Gerald; Brown, Sakar; Ushay, H.

Currently, diagnosis is based on molecular techniques, which detect the viral nucleic acids when present at detectable levels. The serum IgG response against SARS-CoV-2 was examined by using an ELISA-based assay. Serum samples, along with nasopharyngeal specimens were collected from various cohorts and analyzed by ELISA and rRT-PCR, respectively. A total of 167 serum samples were tested for serum IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in outpatient cohorts, 15 (8.9%) were positive by rRT-PCR and the remaining 152 (91%) were negative. We used these data to generate two different assay cutoffs for serum IgG assay and investigated percent concordance with rRT-PCR test results. The emergency department data revealed, out of 151 nasopharyngeal swabs, 4 (2.6%) were positive by rRT-PCR and 18 (11.9%) were positive for serum IgG assay.

Peri-urban settings in Kenya have been reported to exhibit higher rates of maternal death during labor and childbirth as compared to the general Kenyan population. Although research indicates that women in Kenya have increased access to facility-based birth in recent years, a small percentage still give birth outside of the health facility due to access challenges and poor maternal health service quality. Most studies assessing facility-based births have focused on the sociodemographic determinants of birthing location. Few studies have assessed women’s user experiences and perceptions of quality of care during childbirth. Understanding women’s experiences can provide different stakeholders with strategies to structure the provision of maternity care to be person-centered and to contribute to improvements in women’s satisfaction with health services and maternal health outcomes. METHODS: A qualitative study was conducted, whereby 70 women from the peri-urban area of Embakasi in the East side of Nairobi City in Kenya were interviewed. Respondents were aged 18 to 49 years and had delivered in a health facility in the preceding six weeks. We conducted in-depth interviews with women who gave birth at both public and private health facilities. The interviews were recorded, transcribed, and translated for analysis. Braune and Clarke’s guidelines for thematic analysis were used to generate themes from the interview data. RESULTS: Four main themes emerged from the analysis. Women had positive experiences when care was person-centered—i.e. responsive, dignified, supportive, and with respectful communication. They had negative experiences when they were mistreated, which was manifested as non-responsive care (including poor reception and long wait times), non-dignified care (including verbal and physical abuse lack of privacy and confidentiality), lack of respectful communication, and lack of supportive care (including being denied companions, neglect and abandonment, and poor facility environment).

In order to identify long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that may be involved in the development of CTEPH, comprehensive lncRNA and messenger RNA (mRNA) profiling of endothelial tissues from the pulmonary arteries of CTEPH patients was conducted with microarray analysis. Differential expression of 185 lncRNAs was observed in the CTEPH tissues compared with healthy control tissues. Further analysis identified 464 regulated enhancer-like lncRNAs and overlapping, antisense or nearby mRNA pairs. Coexpression networks were subsequently constructed and investigated. The expression levels of the lncRNAs, NR_036693, NR_027783, NR_033766 and NR_001284, were significantly altered. Gene ontology and pathway analysis demonstrated the potential role of lncRNAs in the regulation of central process, including inflammatory response, response to endogenous stimulus and antigen processing and presentation. The use of bioinformatics may help to uncover and analyze large quantities of data identified by microarray analyses, through rigorous experimental planning, statistical analysis and the collection of more comprehensive data regarding CTEPH. The results of the present study provided evidence which may be helpful in future studies on the diagnosis and management of CTEPH.","GU, SONG; LI, GUANGHUI; ZHANG, XITAO; YAN, JUN; GAO, JIE; AN, XIANGGUANG; LIU, YAN; SU, PIXIONG",Mol Med Rep,289,23

Despite the need to research the relationship between cultural and linguistic diversity and health literacy, CALD participants are often cited as hard-to-reach or hidden. This paper evaluates the approach used by researchers to attract and retain hard-to-reach CALD research participants for a study investigating health communication barriers between CALD health care users and health care professionals in regional Australia. As the study was taking place in 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent restrictions emerged. Thus, recruitment and retention methods were adapted. This evaluation considers the effectiveness of recruitment and data collection methods used throughout pre-COVID and during-COVID periods. OBJECTIVE This evaluation sought to determine the effectiveness of recruitment and retention efforts of researchers, during a study which targeted regional-dwelling, hard-to-reach CALD participants. METHODS In this paper, recruitment and retention methods have been categorized into five phases: recruitment, pre-intervention data collection, intervention, post-intervention data collection and interviews. To compare the methods used by researchers, recruitment and retention rates have been dissected into pre-COVID and during-COVID periods. Thereafter in-depth reflections of the methods employed within this study are presented. RESULTS This paper provides results relating to participant recruitment and retainment over the course of five research phases which occurred pre- and during-COVID. During the pre-COVID recruitment phase 22 participants were recruited. Of those, 15 (68.2%) of participants transitioned to the next phase and completed the initial data collection phase. By contrast, 18 participants completed the during-COVID recruitment phase, with 13 (72.2%) continuing to the next phase. The success rate of the intervention phase in the pre-COVID period was 93.3% (14 of 15) versus 84.6% (11 of 13) during-COVID. Lastly, 92.9% (13 of 14) of participants completed the post-intervention data collection in the pre-COVID period, compared with 90.9% (10 of 11) during-COVID. In total, 40 participants took part in the initial data collection phase, with 23 (57.5%) completing the five research phases. Due to a small sample size, it was not determined if there was any statistical significance between the groups (pre-COVID and during-COVID). CONCLUSIONS The success of this program in recruiting and maintaining regional-dwelling, hard-to-reach CALD populations was preserved over pre and during-COVID periods. The pandemic required researchers adjust study methods, thereby inadvertently contributing to the recruitment and retention success of the project. The maintenance of participants during this period was due to flexibility offered by researchers through adaptive methods, such as the use of cultural gatekeepers, increased visibility of CALD researchers, use of digital platforms and more. The major findings of this evaluation are twofold. Firstly, increased diversity in the research sample requires a high level of flexibility from researchers, meaning that such projects may be more resource intensive. Secondly, community organizations present a valuable opportunity to connect with potential hard-to-reach research participants.

METHODS: The prospective database of the Division of Thyroid Surgery, China-Japan Union Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China was used for this study. Covid19 emergency levels were stratified according to the World Health Organization: phase I (January 25–February 25, 2020), phase II (February 26–March 19), phase III (March 20–April 20). RESULTS: There were fewer outpatient FNAs and surgeries in 2020 than in 2019. There were no thyroid surgeries during phase I. There were also fewer surgeries for cancer with a significant reduction of advanced stage cancer treatments, mainly stage T1b N1a in phase II and T3bN1b in phase III. Operative times and postoperative stays were significantly shorter during the pandemic compared to our institutional baseline. In phase III, vocal cord paralysis (VCP) increased to 4.3% of our baseline numbers (P = 0.001). There were no cases of Covid19-related complications during the perioperative period. No patients required re-admission to the hospital. CONCLUSION: The Covid19 outbreak reduced thyroid surgery patient volumes. The decrease of Covid19 emergency plans contributed to unexpected outcomes (reduction of early stage cancer treatment, decreased operative times and hospital stays, increased VCP rate).

From May 2008 to September 2010, 443 nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) from hospitalized pediatric patients (age from 1 to 93 months) in Beijing were collected and screened for HPIVs and other common respiratory viruses by real-time RT-PCR. Sixty-two of 443 samples were positive for HPIVs with 4 positive for HPIV-2 and 58 positive for HPIV-3, indicating that HPIV-3 was the predominant virus present during the study period. A phylogenetic tree based on all the available HN (hemagglutinin-neuraminidase) sequences of HPIV-3 indicated that three distinct clusters (A,B, and C) were circulating with some temporal and regional clustering. Cluster C was further divided into sub-clusters, C1, C2, C3 and C4. HPIV-3 from Beijing isolates belonged to sub-cluster C3, and were grouped with the isolates from two Provinces of China and the neighboring country of Japan. Genetic analysis based on entire HN gene revealed that the HPIV-3 isolates from Beijing were highly similar with 97.2%–100% identity at the nucleotide level and these could be divided into two closely related lineages, C3a and C3b. These findings suggested that there was co-circulation of multiple lineages of HPIV-3 in the Beijing region during the study period. This is the first study to describe the epidemiology and molecular characterization of HPIVs in China.","Mao, Naiying; Ji, Yixin; Xie, Zhengde; Wang, Huanhuan; Wang, Huiling; An, Junjing; Zhang, Xinxin; Zhang, Yan; Zhu, Zhen; Cui, Aili; Xu, Songtao; Shen, Kunling; Liu, Chunyan; Yang, Weizhong; Xu, Wenbo",PLoS One,289,16

The virus responsible for this disease is called SARS-CoV-2. It affects its victims respiratory system and causes severe lung inflammation, making it harder for them to breathe. The virus is airborne, and so has a high infection rate. Originated in China last December, the virus has spread across seven continents, affecting the population of over 210 countries, making it one of the fiercest pandemics ever recorded. Despite multiple independent and collaborative attempts to develop a vaccine or a cure, an effective solution is yet to come out. While the disease has put the world in a standstill, detecting the positive subjects and isolating them from the others as soon as possible is the only way to minimize its spread. However, many countries are currently experiencing a massive shortage of diagnostic equipment and medical personals. This insufficiency inspired us to work on a computer-based automatic method for the diagnosis of COVID-19. In this paper, we proposed a sequential Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based model to detect COVID-19 through analyzing Computed Tomography (CT) scan images. The model is capable of identifying the disease with almost 92.5% accuracy. We believe the implementation of this model will help the physicians and pathologists all over the world to single out the victims quickly and thus reduce the prevalence of COVID-19.","Jaid Jim, A.

It could be a newly developed pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) or a pre-existing hypertension developing into superimposed pre-eclamptic toxaemia. PIH affects approximately 10% of pregnancies and can have a serious impact on both maternal and fetal well-being; hence requires frequent monitoring and timely intervention. National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines recommends once or twice weekly monitoring of blood pressure for such patients. The required frequent monitoring comes with certain implications for patients and healthcare services. An average patient with PIH would need to see her healthcare provider once or twice a week until delivery and 6 weeks thereafter. This certainly increases pressure on limited National Health Service (NHS) resources. Home-based monitoring using Telehealth technology can represent a potential solution for achieving good-quality care for the patient without increasing the workload for healthcare providers. We used ‘Florence’, a text-based technology platform to support home monitoring. We tested its acceptability, feasibility and safety to replace face-to-face appointments for blood pressure monitoring in selected patients with PIH. We implemented our project in three progressive phases using a plan, do, study, act methodology. Florence, telehealth technology was used for blood pressure monitoring instead of face-to-face appointments, and the effect of this innovative technology on the services and the patient experience was studied and necessary modifications were made before progression into the next phase. We recruited 75 patients over 12 months through the progressive phases and replaced around 800 face-to-face appointments by remotely supervised monitoring sessions with Florence successfully, with improved care and patient satisfaction. We also achieved better compliance with the NICE guidelines for blood pressure monitoring in PIH. Our project concluded that Telehealth can be a potential solution for improving care in maternity services, with lesser burden on NHS resources.","Fazal, Nusrat; Webb, Anne; Bangoura, Jo; El Nasharty, Mohamed",BMJ Open Qual,289,32

Same-day procedures using conscious sedation carry significant benefits to patients/healthcare providers but data are limited. We evaluated the safety and cost-effectiveness of same-day complex left-atrial arrhythmia ablation. METHOD: Multi-centre retrospective cohort study of all consecutive complex elective left-atrial ablation procedures performed between January 2011 and December 2019. Data were collected on planned same-day discharge versus overnight stay, baseline parameters, procedure details/success, ablation technology, post-operative complications, unplanned overnight admissions/outcomes at 4-months and mortality up to April 2020. A cost analysis of potential savings was also performed. RESULTS: A total of 967 consecutive patients underwent complex left-ablation using radiofrequency (point-by-point ablation aided by 3D-mapping or PVAC catheter ablation with fluoroscopic screening) or cryoballoon-ablation (mean age: 60.9 ± 11.6 years, range 23-83 yrs., 572 [59%] females). The majority of patients had isolation of pulmonary veins alone (n = 846, 87%) and most using conscious-sedation alone (n = 921, 95%). Of the total cohort, 414 (43%) had planned same-day procedure with 35 (8%) admitted overnight due to major (n = 5) or minor (n = 30) complications. Overall acute procedural success-rate was 96% (n = 932). Complications in planned overnight-stay/same-day cohorts were low. At 4-month follow-up there were 62 (6.4%) readmissions (femoral haematomas, palpitation, other reasons); there were 3 deaths at mean follow-up of 42.0 ± 27.6 months, none related to the procedure. Overnight stay costs £350; the same-day ablation policy over this period would have saved £310,450. CONCLUSIONS: Same-day complex left-atrial catheter ablation using conscious sedation is safe and cost-effective with significant benefits for patients and healthcare providers. This is especially important in the current financial climate and Covid-19 pandemic.","He, Hejie; Datla, Sushma; Weight, Nicholas; Raza, Sidra; Lachlan, Thomas; Aldhoon, Bashar; Panikker, Sandeep; Dhanjal, Tarv; Yusuf, Shamil; Foster, William; Hayat, Sajad; Osman, Faizel",Int J Cardiol,289,6

Monitoring of infection rates and seroprevalence can guide public health measures to combat the pandemic. This depends on reliable tests on active and former infections. Here, we set out to develop and validate a specific and sensitive enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels. METHODS: In our ELISA, we used SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) and a stabilized version of the spike (S) ectodomain as antigens. We assessed sera from patients infected with seasonal coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 and controls. We determined and monitored IgM-, IgA- and IgG-antibody responses towards these antigens. In addition, for a panel of 22 sera, virus neutralization and ELISA parameters were measured and correlated. RESULTS: The RBD-based ELISA detected SARS-CoV-2-directed antibodies, did not cross-react with seasonal coronavirus antibodies and correlated with virus neutralization (R(2) = 0.89). Seroconversion started at 5 days after symptom onset and led to robust antibody levels at 10 days after symptom onset. We demonstrate high specificity (99.3%; N = 1000) and sensitivity (92% for IgA, 96% for IgG and 98% for IgM; > 10 days after PCR-proven infection; N = 53) in serum. CONCLUSIONS: With the described RBD-based ELISA protocol, we provide a reliable test for seroepidemiological surveys. Due to high specificity and strong correlation with virus neutralization, the RBD ELISA holds great potential to become a preferred tool to assess thresholds of protective immunity after infection and vaccination.

Reductions in PET scan time or radiotracer dosage typically degrade diagnostic image quality (DIQ). Deep-learning-based reconstruction may improve DIQ, but such methods have not been clinically evaluated in a realistic multicenter, multivendor environment. In this study, we evaluated the performance and generalizability of a deep-learning-based image-quality enhancement algorithm applied to fourfold reduced-count whole-body PET in a realistic clinical oncologic imaging environment with multiple blinded readers, institutions, and scanner types. We demonstrate that the low-count-enhanced scans were noninferior to the standard scans in DIQ (p < 0.05) and overall diagnostic confidence (p < 0.001) independent of the underlying PET scanner used. Lesion detection for the low-count-enhanced scans had a high patient-level sensitivity of 0.94 (0.83–0.99) and specificity of 0.98 (0.95–0.99). Interscan kappa agreement of 0.85 was comparable to intrareader (0.88) and pairwise inter-reader agreements (maximum of 0.72). SUV quantification was comparable in the reference regions and lesions (lowest p-value=0.59) and had high correlation (lowest CCC = 0.94). Thus, we demonstrated that deep learning can be used to restore diagnostic image quality and maintain SUV accuracy for fourfold reduced-count PET scans, with interscan variations in lesion depiction, lower than intra- and interreader variations. This method generalized to an external validation set of clinical patients from multiple institutions and scanner types. Overall, this method may enable either dose or exam-duration reduction, increasing safety and lowering the cost of PET imaging.","Chaudhari, Akshay S.; Mittra, Erik; Davidzon, Guido A.; Gulaka, Praveen; Gandhi, Harsh; Brown, Adam; Zhang, Tao; Srinivas, Shyam; Gong, Enhao; Zaharchuk, Greg; Jadvar, Hossein",NPJ Digit Med,289,22

It is uncertain if a similar association exists in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients with acute respiratory failure. METHODS: We aimed to investigate the impact of intensity of ventilation on patient outcome. The PRoVENT-COVID study is a national multicenter observational study in COVID-19 patients receiving invasive ventilation. Ventilator parameters were collected a fixed time points on the first calendar day of invasive ventilation. Mean dynamic ΔP and MP were calculated for individual patients at time points without evidence of spontaneous breathing. A Cox proportional hazard model, and a double stratification analysis adjusted for confounders were used to estimate the independent associations of ΔP and MP with outcome. The primary endpoint was 28-day mortality. RESULTS: In 825 patients included in this analysis, 28-day mortality was 27.5%. ΔP was not independently associated with mortality (HR 1.02 [95% confidence interval 0.88–1.18]; P = 0.750). MP, however, was independently associated with 28-day mortality (HR 1.17 [95% CI 1.01–1.36]; P = 0.031), and increasing quartiles of MP, stratified on comparable levels of ΔP, had higher risks of 28-day mortality (HR 1.15 [95% CI 1.01–1.30]; P = 0.028). CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of critically ill invasively ventilated COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory failure, we show an independent association of MP, but not ΔP with 28-day mortality. MP could serve as one prognostic biomarker in addition to ΔP in these patients. Efforts aiming at limiting both ΔP and MP could translate in a better outcome.

A group of 9 newborn, colostrum-deprived calves was used; two calves were inoculated with attenuated virus, four calves were infected with virulent virus (including one naturally infected calf), and three calves were uninfected controls. Calves inoculated with virulent virus produced higher titers of BCV antibodies in the intestines than those inoculated with the attenuated virus. The failure of the calves to respond to the attenuated virus was apparently due to the inability of the virus to replicate to high titers. Spiral colon, ileum, and jejunum were found to be immunologically distinct; the highest anti-BCV antibody responses were detected in spiral colon, the primary site of infection, and involved all four isotypes of bovine immunoglobulins. The antibody response in ileum was lower than in spiral colon. The immune responses developed slowly in jejunum and were associated primarily with the IgG subtypes.","Kapil, Sanjay; Trent, Ava M.; Goyal, Sagar M.","Comparative Immunology, Microbiology and Infectious Diseases",289,16

We conduct a long-term analysis of spatiotemporal traffic congestion patterns in Madrid (Spain), comparing two urban realms: the 2008 economic crisis and the following post-crisis situation. We apply TomTom Speed Profiles data to assess daily variations in traffic congestion and their changes between both periods, and Twitter data to capture spatial patterns of the daily pulse of the city. Increased traffic, a by-product of economic recovery, resulted in higher congestion, particularly during peak hours. Nevertheless, these changes are spatially uneven. In the city core, an increase in congestion is relatively temporally homogeneous, while in the peripheral suburban zones, there has been only a marginal increase in travel times. On the other hand, in the urban outskirts, increased traffic congestion is more severe but visibly different between north and south. These differences have strong social connotations: over 40% of the population experienced a dramatic increase in travel times (more than 25%) during peak hours. Moreover, low-income groups are more likely to live in the more affected southern districts, suffering most the negative consequences of increased congestion.","Moyano, Amparo; Stępniak, Marcin; Moya-Gómez, Borja; García-Palomares, Juan Carlos",Transportation (Amst),289,20

Rationales behind these two strategies, however, were debated, especially regarding quantitative recommendations. The answers to “what is the safe distance” and “what is sufficient ventilation” are crucial to the upcoming reopening of businesses and schools, but rely on many medical, biological, and engineering factors. This study introduced two new indices into the popular while perfect-mixing-based Wells-Riley model for predicting airborne virus related infection probability – the underlying reasons for keeping adequate social distance and space ventilation. The distance index P(d) can be obtained by theoretical analysis on droplet distribution and transmission from human respiration activities, and the ventilation index E(z) represents the system-dependent air distribution efficiency in a space. The study indicated that 1.6-3.0 m (5.2-9.8 ft) is the safe social distance when considering aerosol transmission of exhaled large droplets from talking, while the distance can be up to 8.2 m (26 ft) if taking into account of all droplets under calm air environment. Because of unknown dose response to COVID-19, the model used one actual pandemic case to calibrate the infectious dose (quantum of infection), which was then verified by a number of other existing cases with short exposure time (hours). Projections using the validated model for a variety of scenarios including transportation vehicles and building spaces illustrated that (1) increasing social distance (e.g., halving occupancy density) can significantly reduce the infection rate (20-40%) during the first 30 minutes even under current ventilation practices; (2) minimum ventilation or fresh air requirement should vary with distancing condition, exposure time, and effectiveness of air distribution systems.","Sun, Chanjuan; Zhai, John Z.",Sustain Cities Soc,289,33

Gunshot injuries in a COVID-19 affected individual increases the chances of post-operative morbidity and mortality. Such cases require multidisciplinary approach with an advanced COVID care for the satisfactory outcome. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a case of 30-year-old male with an alleged history of an accidental fire arm injury. His rapid antigen for COVID was positive. Contrast enhanced computed tomogram (CECT) abdomen was suggestive of multiple bowel injuries. Emergency exploratory laparotomy confirmed multiple bowel perforations with no associated solid organ injury. Perforated sites were sealed by primary repair and loop ileostomy was performed. Patient was discharged on post-operative Day 17 with satisfactory clinical improvement. DISCUSSION: Deleterious effects of COVID –19 has questioned the reliance on health care system across the globe. Pulmonary complications affect the post-operative course in patients undergoing surgery. However not every patient with peri operatively detected COVID – 19 will have complicated post-operative course. Managing such patients with perioperative COVID –19 is an uphill task. Hemodynamic instability and clinical signs of peritonitis mandates the operative management. Multidisciplinary approach with advanced post-operative COVID care is required for satisfactory outcome CONCLUSION: Management of patients undergoing emergency procedure with peri- operative COVID 19 is challenging for the attending surgeon. Consider all surgical emergencies as COVID positive unless proved otherwise. Multidisciplinary approach for management of COVID- 19 infection along with good post-operative care is required.,"Rohita, Gupta; Hariprasad, Chinniahnapalaya Pandurangaiah; Kumar, Anil; Kishor, Shiv; Kumar, Deepak; Paswan, Shiv Shankar",Int J Surg Case Rep,289,28

Limited availability of human pathologic specimens during early RSV-induced lung disease and ethical restrictions for RSV challenge studies in the lower airways of human volunteers has slowed our understanding of how RSV causes airway disease and greatly limited the development of therapeutic strategies for reducing RSV disease burden. Our current knowledge of RSV infection and pathology is largely based on in vitro studies using nonpolarized epithelial cell-lines grown on plastic or in vivo studies using animal models semipermissive for RSV infection. Although these models have revealed important aspects of RSV infection, replication, and associated inflammatory responses, these models do not broadly recapitulate the early interactions and potential consequences of RSV infection of the human columnar airway epithelium in vivo. In this chapter, the pro et contra of in vitro models of human columnar airway epithelium and their usefulness in respiratory virus pathogenesis and vaccine development studies will be discussed. The use of such culture models to predict characteristics of RSV infection and the correlation of these findings to the human in vivo situation will likely accelerate our understanding of RSV pathogenesis potentially identifying novel strategies for limiting the severity of RSV-associated airway disease.","Pickles, Raymond J.",Challenges and Opportunities for Respiratory Syncytial Virus Vaccines,289,32

This study compared outcome measures of a synchronous virtual delivery of MIM, necessitated by COVID-19, to traditional in-person delivery of MIM. Outcome measures from the virtual COVID (AU20, WI21, SP21) MIM cohorts (n = 99) were compared with the in-person Pre-COVID (SP19, AU19, WI20) MIM cohorts (n = 124). Both Pre-COVID and COVID cohorts had similar attendance rates with an average attendance of 84 and 80%, respectively. Qualitative analysis of COVID cohorts reported community support during COVID as a substantial intervention benefit, which was important at a time when isolation dominated the healthcare professional experience. Total burnout was determined by scores on the subscales of the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI). There were no significant differences in depersonalization (p = 0.3876) and personal accomplishment (p = 0.1519) changes between Pre-COVID and COVID cohorts, however there was a significant difference in emotional exhaustion (p = 0.0315), with COVID cohorts improving more. In both Pre, and COVID cohorts, the percentage of people meeting burnout criteria from pre to post between groups were similar, yielding a non-significant difference (p = 0.2950). The Connor Davidson Resiliency Scale (CDRS) and Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (UWES) also produced no significant differences between groups (p = 0.4259, p = 0.1984, respectively). The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) though yielded significant differences in reduction between groups (p = 0.0405), again with COVID cohorts showing greater improvement. Results of the first synchronous, virtually delivered MIM cohorts reflect that participants achieved very similar results and that MIM created a community in a time when it was greatly needed due to pandemic healthcare professional stress.","Klatt, Maryanna; Bawa, Rani; Gabram, Olivia; Westrick, Alexis; Blake, Amanda",Front Psychol,289,16

The current study sought to examine differences in direct, indirect, and intangible costs among Canadian families with and without a food-allergic child. METHODS: Families with a child with a specialist-diagnosed food allergy (cases) were recruited from two tertiary pediatric allergy clinics in the Province of Manitoba, Canada, and matched, based on age and sex, to families without a food-allergic child (controls). Cost data for the two groups were collected via an adapted version of the Food Allergy Economic Questionnaire (FA-EcoQ). Consideration was given to income, defined as above vs. below the provincial annual median income. RESULTS: Results from 35 matched case/control pairs revealed that while total household costs did not significantly differ between cases and controls, food-allergic families did incur higher direct costs ($12,455.69 vs. $10,078.93, p = 0.02), which were largely attributed to spending on food. In contrast, cases reported lower, but not statistically significant, total indirect costs compared to controls ($10,038.76 vs. $12,294.12, p = 0.06). Families also perceived their food-allergic child as having poorer quality of life relative to their healthy peers. Lastly, stratification of the analyses by annual income revealed several differences between the higher and lower income groups. CONCLUSIONS: Relative to families without a food-allergic child, food-allergic families incurred higher direct costs across a number of different areas.

The preparation included the identification of a person under investigation (PUI) room, converting short stay wards into COVID-19 isolation areas, and relocating the paediatric section to an area outside the emergency centre. Finally, we had to divide the emergency centre into a respiratory and non-respiratory side by utilising part of the hospital’s main reception. We are positive that the preparation and reorganization of the emergency centre will limit nosocomial transmission during the expected COVID-19 surge.

At the time of the COVID-19 outbreak and lockdown measures, six of the seven organizations had begun implementing their chosen innovation (peer workers, wellness recovery action planning facilitator training, staff training and a family support group). This mid-implementation study used the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) to identify contextual factors that influenced organizations to continue or postpone implementation of recovery-oriented innovations in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Twenty-seven semi-structured 45-min interviews were conducted between May and June 2020 (21 implementation team members and six providers of the innovation (trainers, facilitators, peer workers). Interview guides and analysis were based on the CFIR. Content analysis combined deductive and inductive approaches. Summaries of coded data were given ratings based on strength and valence of the construct’s impact on implementation. Ratings were visualized by mid-implementation outcome and recovery innovation to identify constructs which appear to distinguish between sites with a more or less favorable mid-implementation outcomes. RESULTS: Four mid-implementation outcomes were observed at this snapshot in time (from most to least positive): continued implementation with adaptation (one site), postponement with adaptation and estimated relaunch date (four sites), indefinite postponement with no decision on relaunch date (one site), and no implementation of innovation yet (one site). Two constructs had either a negative influence (external policies and incentives—renamed COVID-19-related external policy for this study) or a positive influence (leadership engagement), regardless of implementation outcome. Four factors appeared to distinguish between more or less positive mid-implementation outcome: adaptability, implementation climate and relative priority, available resources, and formally appointed internal implementation leaders (renamed “engaging implementation teams during the COVID-19 pandemic” for this study). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented outer setting factor. Studies that use the CFIR at the mid-implementation stage are rare, as are studies focusing on the outer setting. Through robust qualitative analysis, we identify the key factors that shaped the course of implementation of recovery innovations over this turbulent time.

The SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro), a key coronavirus enzyme, which is a potential drug target, has been successfully crystallised. There is evidence suggesting that statins exert anti-viral activity and may block the infectivity of enveloped viruses. The aim of this study was to assess whether statins are potential COVID-19 Mpro inhibitors, using a molecular docking study. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Molecular docking was performed using AutoDock/Vina, a computational docking program. SARS-CoV-2 Mpro was docked with all statins, while antiviral and antiretroviral drugs – favipiravir, nelfinavir, and lopinavir – were used as standards for comparison. RESULTS: The binding energies obtained from the docking of 6LU7 with native ligand favipiravir, nelfinavir, lopinavir, simvastatin, rosuvastatin, pravastatin, pitavastatin, lovastatin, fluvastatin, and atorvastatin were –6.8, –5.8, –7.9, –7.9, –7.0, –7.7, –6.6, –8.2, –7.4, –7.7, and –6.8 kcal/mol, respectively. The number of hydrogen bonds between statins and amino acid residues of Mpro were 7, 4, and 3 for rosuvastatin, pravastatin, and atorvastatin, respectively, while other statins had two hydrogen bonds. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate, based upon the binding energy of pitavastatin, rosuvastatin, lovastatin, and fluvastatin, that statins could be efficient SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors. This is supported by the fact that the effects of some statins, especially pitavastatin, have a binding energy that is even greater than that of protease or polymerase inhibitors. However, further research is necessary to investigate their potential use as drugs for COVID-19.","Reiner, Željko; Hatamipour, Mahdi; Banach, Maciej; Pirro, Matteo; Al-Rasadi, Khalid; Jamialahmadi, Tannaz; Radenkovic, Dina; Montecucco, Fabrizio; Sahebkar, Amirhossein",Arch Med Sci,289,29

During the COVID-19 pandemic, patients taking clozapine will be self-isolating to reduce the risk of infection, not least because these patients are at high risk of serious illness and fatality because of high rates of diabetes, obesity and pulmonary disease and an increased risk of pneumonia. Problems may also arise because both clozapine-induced myocarditis and neutropenic sepsis share signs and symptoms with COVID-19 (fever, chest pain, dyspnoea, etc.). We recommend decreasing the frequency of physical contacts by extending the blood monitoring interval to 12 weeks in those patients taking clozapine for more than 1 year. To distinguish COVID-19 from clozapine-related physical adverse effects, we suggest an urgent antigen test alongside a full blood count. In those taking clozapine who develop COVID-19, we suggest continuing with clozapine whenever possible (even during ventilation), reducing the dose if necessary in line with blood assay results. Blood monitoring should continue but clozapine should only cease if there is a significant fall in neutrophils (COVID-19 is linked to lymphopenia but not neutropenia). To protect against the likelihood and severity of respiratory infection, we recommend the use of vitamin D in all clozapine patients. Initiation of clozapine is likely to remain problematic while the risk of infection remains, given the degree of physical contact required to assure safety.","Gee, Siobhan; Gaughran, Fiona; MacCabe, James; Shergill, Sukhi; Whiskey, Eromona; Taylor, David",Ther Adv Psychopharmacol,289,5

In both children and kittens there is a significant association between aEPEC burden and diarrheal disease, however the infection can be found in individuals with and without diarrhea. It remains unclear to what extent, under what conditions, or by what mechanisms aEPEC serves as a primary pathogen in individuals with diarrhea. It seems likely that a combination of host and bacterial factors enable aEPEC to cause disease in some individuals and not in others. The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of aEPEC on intestinal function and diarrhea in kittens following experimentally-induced carriage and the influence of a disrupted intestinal microbiota on disease susceptibility. Results of this study identify aEPEC as a potential pathogen in kittens. In the absence of disruption to the intestinal microbiota, kittens are resistant to clinical signs of aEPEC carriage but demonstrate significant occult changes in intestinal absorption and permeability. Antibiotic-induced disruption of the intestinal microbiota prior to infection increases subsequent intestinal water loss as determined by % fecal wet weight. Enrichment of the intestinal microbiota with a commensal member of the feline mucosa-associated microbiota, Enterococcus hirae, ameliorated the effects of aEPEC experimental infection on intestinal function and water loss. These observations begin to unravel the mechanisms by which aEPEC infection may be able to exploit susceptible hosts.","Watson, Victoria E.; Jacob, Megan E.; Bruno-Bárcena, José M.; Amirsultan, Sophia; Stauffer, Stephen H.; Píqueras, Victoria O.; Frias, Rafael; Gookin, Jody L.",Veterinary Microbiology,289,16
