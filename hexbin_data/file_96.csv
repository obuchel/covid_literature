163,163,163,Oct-4 Expression Maintained Cancer Stem-Like Properties in Lung Cancer-Derived CD133-Positive Cells,14.267107,7.9698076,2008-07-09,"CD133 (prominin-1), a 5-transmembrane glycoprotein, has recently been considered to be an important marker that represents the subset population of cancer stem-like cells. Herein we report the isolation of CD133-positive cells (LC-CD133(+)) and CD133-negative cells (LC-CD133(−)) from tissue samples of ten patients with non-small cell lung cancer (LC) and five LC cell lines. LC-CD133(+) displayed higher Oct-4 expressions with the ability to self-renew and may represent a reservoir with proliferative potential for generating lung cancer cells. Furthermore, LC-CD133(+), unlike LC-CD133(−), highly co-expressed the multiple drug-resistant marker ABCG2 and showed significant resistance to chemotherapy agents (i.e., cisplatin, etoposide, doxorubicin, and paclitaxel) and radiotherapy. The treatment of Oct-4 siRNA with lentiviral vector can specifically block the capability of LC-CD133(+) to form spheres and can further facilitate LC-CD133(+) to differentiate into LC-CD133(−). In addition, knock-down of Oct-4 expression in LC-CD133(+) can significantly inhibit the abilities of tumor invasion and colony formation, and increase apoptotic activities of caspase 3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Finally, in vitro and in vivo studies further confirm that the treatment effect of chemoradiotherapy for LC-CD133(+) can be improved by the treatment of Oct-4 siRNA. In conclusion, we demonstrated that Oct-4 expression plays a crucial role in maintaining the self-renewing, cancer stem-like, and chemoradioresistant properties of LC-CD133(+). Future research is warranted regarding the up-regulated expression of Oct-4 in LC-CD133(+) and malignant lung cancer.","Chen, Yu-Chih; Hsu, Han-Shui; Chen, Yi-Wei; Tsai, Tung-Hu; How, Chorng-Kuang; Wang, Chien-Ying; Hung, Shih-Chieh; Chang, Yuh-Lih; Tsai, Ming-Long; Lee, Yi-Yen; Ku, Hung-Hai; Chiou, Shih-Hwa",PLoS One,96,1
241,241,241,Increased expression levels of the pvcrt-o and pvmdr1 genes in a patient with severe Plasmodium vivax malaria,14.383339,7.879304,2009-04-02,"BACKGROUND: There are increasing reports of severe clinical cases exclusively associated with Plasmodium vivax infections. Notably, this severity has been recently suggested to be associated with chloroquine resistance. PATIENTS: Two different patients presented at the Hospital Clinic in Barcelona with P. vivax malaria episodes. One patient had severe symptoms and the other mild symptoms. Both patients traveled through the Brazilian Amazon (Manaus) in 2007. For both patients the current diagnosis of malaria was the first. Two other patients with mild symptoms presented to the ""Centro de Pesquisa em Medicina Tropical"", also in the Brazilian Amazon (Rondônia) in 2000. METHODS: To exclude the possibility that the patient's severe symptoms were due to Plasmodium falciparum, a nested PCR was performed. A magnetic method was used to purify P. vivax free of human leukocytes. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed to compare the transcript levels of two main transporters likely to be involved in chloroquine resistance in P. vivax, namely the P. vivax chloroquine resistance transporter, pvcrt-o, and the P. vivax multidrug resistance transporter, pvmdr 1. RESULTS: Results demonstrated that the severe clinical symptoms were exclusively due to P. vivax. The patient presented acute respiratory conditions requiring admission to the intensive care unit. The magnetic method showed highly purified infected-reticulocytes with mature stages. In addition, it was found that parasites obtained from the severe patient had up to 2.9-fold increase in pvmdr1 levels and up to 21.9-fold increase in pvcrt-o levels compared to expression levels of parasites from the other patients with mild symptoms. CONCLUSION: This is the first clinical case of severe disease exclusively associated with vivax malaria in Spain. Moreover, these findings suggest that clinical severity could be associated with increased expression levels of parasite genes likely involved in chloroquine resistance. It is necessary to further explore the potential of pvmdr1 and particularly pvcrt-o expression levels as molecular markers of severe disease in P. vivax.","Fernández-Becerra, Carmen; Pinazo, Maria Jesús; González, Ana; Alonso, Pedro L; del Portillo, Hernando A; Gascón, Joaquim",Malar J,96,1
417,417,417,Isolation and characterization of microparticles in sputum from cystic fibrosis patients,14.628017,8.08116,2010-07-09,"BACKGROUND: Microparticles (MPs) are membrane vesicles released during cell activation and apoptosis. MPs have different biological effects depending on the cell from they originate. Cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease is characterized by massive neutrophil granulocyte influx in the airways, their activation and eventually apoptosis. We investigated on the presence and phenotype of MPs in the sputum, a rich non-invasive source of inflammation biomarkers, of acute and stable CF adult patients. METHODS: Spontaneous sputum, obtained from 21 CF patients (10 acute and 11 stable) and 7 patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), was liquefied with Sputasol. MPs were counted, visualized by electron microscopy, and identified in the supernatants of treated sputum by cytofluorimetry and immunolabelling for leukocyte (CD11a), granulocyte (CD66b), and monocyte-macrophage (CD11b) antigens. RESULTS: Electron microscopy revealed that sputum MPs were in the 100-500 nm range and did not contain bacteria, confirming microbiological tests. CF sputa contained higher number of MPs in comparison with PCD sputa. Levels of CD11a(+)-and CD66b(+)-, but not CD11b(+)-MPs were significantly higher in CF than in PCD, without differences between acute and stable patients. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, MPs are detectable in sputa obtained from CF patients and are predominantly of granulocyte origin. This novel isolation method for MPs from sputum opens a new opportunity for the study of lung pathology in CF.","Porro, Chiara; Lepore, Silvia; Trotta, Teresa; Castellani, Stefano; Ratclif, Luigi; Battaglino, Anna; Di Gioia, Sante; Martínez, Maria C; Conese, Massimo; Maffione, Angela B",Respir Res,96,1
452,452,452,Urine Peptidomic and Targeted Plasma Protein Analyses in the Diagnosis and Monitoring of Systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis,14.569105,8.313073,2010-09-30,"PURPOSE: Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis is a chronic pediatric disease. The initial clinical presentation can mimic other pediatric inflammatory conditions, which often leads to significant delays in diagnosis and appropriate therapy. SJIA biomarker development is an unmet diagnostic/prognostic need to prevent disease complications. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We profiled the urine peptidome to analyze a set of 102 urine samples, from patients with SJIA, Kawasaki disease (KD), febrile illnesses (FI), and healthy controls. A set of 91 plasma samples, from SJIA flare and quiescent patients, were profiled using a customized antibody array against 43 proteins known to be involved in inflammatory and protein catabolic processes. RESULTS: We identified a 17-urine-peptide biomarker panel that could effectively discriminate SJIA patients at active, quiescent, and remission disease states, and patients with active SJIA from confounding conditions including KD and FI. Targeted sequencing of these peptides revealed that they fall into several tight clusters from seven different proteins, suggesting disease-specific proteolytic activities. The antibody array plasma profiling identified an SJIA plasma flare signature consisting of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP1), interleukin (IL)-18, regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES), P-Selectin, MMP9, and L-Selectin. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The urine peptidomic and plasma protein analyses have the potential to improve SJIA care and suggest that SJIA urine peptide biomarkers may be an outcome of inflammation-driven effects on catabolic pathways operating at multiple sites.

894,894,894,Analysis on the Pathogenesis of Symptomatic Pulmonary Embolism with Human Genomics,14.484462,8.145216,2012-07-11,"BACKGROUND: In the present study, the whole human genome oligo microarray was employed to investigate the gene expression profile in symptomatic pulmonary embolism (PE). METHODS: Twenty patients with PE and 20 age and gender matched patients without PE as controls were enrolled into the present study in the same period. The diagnosis of PE was based on the clinical manifestations and findings on imaging examinations. Acute arterial and/or venous thrombosis was excluded in controls. The whole human genome oligo microarray was employed for detection. Statistical analysis was performed with t test following analysis of very small samples of repeated measurements and Gene Ontology (GO) analysis. RESULTS: Genomic data showed no damage to vascular endothelial cells in PE patients. Genomic data only found increased mRNA expression of a small amount of coagulation factors in PE patients. In the PE group, anticoagulant proteins, Fibrinolytic system and proteins related to platelet functions only played partial roles in the pathogenesis of PE. In addition, the mRNA expressions of a fraction of adhesion molecules were markedly up-regulated. Gene Ontology analysis showed the genes with down-regulated expressions mainly explain the compromised T cell immunity. Symptomatic VTE patients have compromised T cell immunity. CONCLUSION: The damage to vascular endothelial cells is not necessary in the pathogenesis of VTE, and only a fraction of factors involved in the shared coagulation cascade are activated. Genomic results may provide a new clue for clinical diagnosis, treatment and prevention of VTE.","Wang, Hao; Duan, Qianglin; Wang, Lemin; Gong, Zhu; Liang, Aibin; Wang, Qiang; Song, Haoming; Yang, Fan; Song, Yanli",Int J Med Sci,96,11
2145,2145,2145,"Perception, Price and Preference: Consumption and Protection of Wild Animals Used in Traditional Medicine",14.388736,7.930136,2016-03-01,"A wide array of wildlife species, including many animals, are used in traditional medicines across many medicinal systems, including in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). Due to over-exploitation and habitat loss, the populations of many animals commonly used in TCM have declined and are unable to meet market demand. A number of measures have been taken to try to reduce the impact that this large and growing market for TCM may have on wild animal species. Consumer preferences and behavior are known to play an important role in the consumption and protection of wild animals used in traditional medicine, and thus are likely to be an important factor in the success of many of these mechanisms—particularly given the significant percentage of TCMs that are over-the-counter products (access to which is not mediated by practitioners). In this study we conducted questionnaires and designed stated preference experiments embodying different simulation scenarios using a random sample of the population in Beijing to elicit individuals’ knowledge, perceptions and preferences toward wild or farmed animal materials and their substitutes used in traditional Chinese medicine. We found that respondents had a stated preference for wild materials over farm-raised and other alternatives because they believe that the effectiveness of wild-sourced materials is more credible than that of other sources. However, we also found that, although respondents used TCM products, they had a poor understanding of the function or composition of either traditional Chinese medicines or proprietary Chinese medicines (PCM), and paid little attention to the composition of products when making purchasing decisions. Furthermore, awareness of the need for species protection, or “conservation consciousness” was found to play an important role in willingness to accept substitutions for wild animal materials, while traditional animal medicinal materials (TAMs) derived from well-known endangered species, such as bear bile and tiger bone, show relatively higher substitutability. These results suggest that there is still hope for conservation measures which seek to promote a transition to farmed animal, plant and synthetic ingredients and provide clear directions for future social marketing, education and engagement efforts.","Liu, Zhao; Jiang, Zhigang; Fang, Hongxia; Li, Chunwang; Mi, Aizi; Chen, Jing; Zhang, Xiaowei; Cui, Shaopeng; Chen, Daiqiang; Ping, Xiaoge; Li, Feng; Li, Chunlin; Tang, Songhua; Luo, Zhenhua; Zeng, Yan; Meng, Zhibin",PLoS One,96,19
2453,2453,2453,Neural Control of Blood Pressure in Chronic Intermittent Hypoxia,14.415013,8.28445,2016-02-02,"Sleep apnea (SA) is increasing in prevalence and is commonly comorbid with hypertension. Chronic intermittent hypoxia is used to model the arterial hypoxemia seen in SA, and through this paradigm, the mechanisms that underlie SA-induced hypertension are becoming clear. Cyclic hypoxic exposure during sleep chronically stimulates the carotid chemoreflexes, inducing sensory long-term facilitation, and drives sympathetic outflow from the hindbrain. The elevated sympathetic tone drives hypertension and renal sympathetic activity to the kidneys resulting in increased plasma renin activity and eventually angiotensin II (Ang II) peripherally. Upon waking, when respiration is normalized, the sympathetic activity does not diminish. This is partially because of adaptations leading to overactivation of the hindbrain regions controlling sympathetic outflow such as the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS), and rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM). The sustained sympathetic activity is also due to enhanced synaptic signaling from the forebrain through the paraventricular nucleus (PVN). During the waking hours, when the chemoreceptors are not exposed to hypoxia, the forebrain circumventricular organs (CVOs) are stimulated by peripherally circulating Ang II from the elevated plasma renin activity. The CVOs and median preoptic nucleus chronically activate the PVN due to the Ang II signaling. All together, this leads to elevated nocturnal mean arterial pressure (MAP) as a response to hypoxemia, as well as inappropriately elevated diurnal MAP in response to maladaptations.","Shell, Brent; Faulk, Katelynn; Cunningham, J.

3399,3399,3399,Polymorphisms in AURKA and AURKB are associated with the survival of triple-negative breast cancer patients treated with taxane-based adjuvant chemotherapy,14.575516,7.8046083,2018-09-21,"PURPOSE: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is more than a single disease. Identifying biomarkers to further subdivide TNBC patients with distinct outcome is of great importance. It has been reported that single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in Aurora kinase A (AURKA) or Aurora kinase B (AURKB) are associated with the risk and survival of several cancers. But till now, there is no research about these polymorphisms in TNBC patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, we investigated the association between polymorphisms in AURKA or AURKB gene and prognosis of TNBC patients treated with taxane-based adjuvant chemotherapy. A total of 273 TNBC patients were enrolled. Haploview 4.2 software was used to identify Tag SNPs. Genotyping was conducted using the MassARRAY MALDI-TOF system. RESULTS: We found that AURKA rs6099128 GG genotype carriers had significantly worse overall survival (OS) than TT+ TG genotype carriers (P = 0.003, HR = 12.499, 95% CI = 2.357–66.298). AURKB rs11651993 TT genotype carriers had better disease-free survival (DFS) than TC + CC genotype carriers (P = 0.018, HR = 1.876, 95% CI = 1.116–3.154). AURKB rs2289590 CC genotype carriers had worse DFS than CA + AA genotype carriers (P = 0.021, HR = 0.536, 95% CI = 0.315–0.912). After subgroup analysis, rs11651993 TC + CC genotype predicted worse DFS in subgroups of age ≤ 50, post-menopausal, grade unknown (UK), tumor size >2 cm, and lymph node negative. Rs2289590 CA + AA genotype could predict favorable DFS in pre-menopausal, grade 3 and lymph node-positive patients. CONCLUSION: We first demonstrated that polymorphisms in AURKA or AURKB gene might predict the OS or DFS of TNBC patients treated with taxane-based adjuvant chemotherapy.","Liao, Yuqian; Liao, Yulu; Li, Jun; Li, Junyu; Fan, Ying; Xu, Binghe",Cancer Manag Res,96,1

Design: Prospective case series. Setting: Walk-in medical clinic of a university hospital. Patients: 507 patients with cold or flu symptoms, sore throat, or recent cough; 21 control subjects without symptoms of upper respiratory infection. Measurements and main results: After thorough history and physical examination, the patients underwent nasopharyngeal aspiration and throat culture. Nasopharyngeal specimens were cultured for both bacteria and viruses; antigens for influenza, parainfluenza, and respiratory syncytial virus were sought by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); serum antibodies to viral respiratory pathogens were determined. Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci grew from the throat specimens of 39 of the 507 patients (8%) or 38 of 3 34 patients (11%) who had clinical diagnoses of pharyngitis. Thirty-three cases of influenza A, 20 cases of influenza B, and seven cases of parainfluenza infections were diagnosed. Bacteria were cultured from the nasopharyngeal secretions of 284 patients (56%). In contrast to pharyngeal culture, commensal mixed flora were rarely found in nasopharyngeal culture. Nasopharyngeal culture of bacteria usually considered to be respiratory pathogens was significantly associated with the presence of leukocytes.Streptococcus pneumoniae (odds ratio 6.0, 95% confidence interval 2.6–14.2),Moraxella catarrbalis (odds ratio 12.9, 95% confidence interval 3.1–79.5), andHemophilus influenzae (odds ratio 3.0, 95% confidence interval 1.2–7.4) were all associated with the presence of leukocytes. In contrast, nasophaiyngeal culture of coagulase-negative staphylococci, mixed flora, and the documentation of a viral infection were not associated with the presence of leukocytes. For none of 21 control subjects were “pathogenic” bacteria found. Conclusions: These data suggest that potentially pathogenic bacteria may have a causal role in adult nasopharyngitis, although further data are needed to confirm this hypothesis.","Heald, Alison; Auckenthaler, Raymond; Borst, Francois; Delaspre, Olca; Cermann, Daniel; Matter, Lukas; Kaiser, Laurent; Stalder, Hans",J Gen Intern Med,96,11

METHODS: The author reviewed Standard Precautions, including two new elements introduced by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2007: safe injection practices and respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette. Standard Precautions sometimes are referred to as the first tier of precautions because for some diseases and circumstances, transmission cannot be interrupted completely with Standard Precautions alone and it is necessary to use second-tier Transmission-Based Precautions. The author reviewed the three categories of Transmission-Based Precautions—Airborne, Droplet and Contact—with an emphasis on their use in dental health care outpatient settings. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Dental health care personnel (DHCP) should update their infection control programs to ensure that safe injection practices and respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette measures are used routinely. In addition, with the emergence of new pathogens, re-emergence of variant organisms and more patients seeking care in ambulatory care facilities, DHCP need to be aware of additional measures to take when treating patients in their offices who are actively infected with certain organisms to protect fully other patients, their staff members and themselves.","Harte, Jennifer A.",J Am Dent Assoc,96,22

This report focuses on both the acute and chronic effects on respiratory function of these ubiquitous infections. Infant airways are particularly vulnerable due to the relatively low conductance in immature peripheral airways. Bronchiolitis, caused predominantly by respiratory syncytial virus, is the most important of these viral illnesses and is emerging as a major risk factor for the subsequent development of obstructive airway disease in adults, possibly by interference with normal alveolar proliferation. The basic pathogenic mechanism involved in adult respiratory viral infection is bronchial hyperreactivity, presumably secondary to epithelial damage and resultant sensitization of rapidly adapting airway receptors. In addition, there may be virus-related alterations in the autonomic and humoral regulation of airway tone. Viral infections may alter the effects of common air pollutants on respiratory function.","Hall, William J.; Hall, Caroline B.",Chest,96,22

The disease is spread worldwide and is usually benign but, in some groups of population like pregnant women, can have a severe outcome. Due to a not optimal vaccination coverage, a relatively high number of childbearing-aged women in a European country such as Italy tested seronegative for VZV and so are currently at risk of acquiring chickenpox during pregnancy, especially if they live in contact with children for family or work reasons. Only few data are available about the risk of infection in this setting: the incidence of chickenpox may range from 1.5 to 4.6 cases/1000 childbearing females and from 1.21 to 6 cases/10,000 pregnant women, respectively. This review is aimed to focus on the epidemiology and the clinical management of exposure to chickenpox during pregnancy. Particular emphasis is given to the accurate screening of childbearing women at the time of the first gynecological approach — the females who tested susceptible to infection can be counseled about the risks and instructed on procedure should contact occur — and to the early prophylaxis of the at-risk exposure.

Radiographs were evaluated for consolidation, ground-glass opacities, interstitial patterns, distribution, and extent of findings. Eighty-seven (83.7%) of the patients were managed in the ward, and 17 (16.3%) patients eventually required admission to the ICU. All patients admitted to the ICU showed abnormalities on the initial radiograph. The presence of consolidation, multifocal, diffuse, and bilateral involvement on the initial radiograph was associated with a statistically higher risk of requiring ICU admission (p < 0.001). There were no significant differences regarding age, sex, and presence of underlying comorbidities. Evolution to ARDS was found in eight cases that necessitated ICU care. All of them had on the initial radiograph patchy multifocal consolidations (p < 0.001) with bilateral lesions in six cases. A higher number of lung zones involved and consolidation on the initial chest radiograph as well as a rapid progression of the radiological abnormalities were identified in patients requiring ICU admission and development of ARDS.

Evidence suggests that infants with meconium aspiration syndrome and children with acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome may benefit, while no positive effect of surfactant is seen in infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia. However, more research is needed to establish potential beneficial effects of surfactant administration in children with lung diseases other than RDS. Furthermore, genetic disorders of surfactant metabolism have recently been linked to respiratory diseases of formerly unknown origin. It is important to consider these disorders in the differential diagnosis of unexplained respiratory distress although no established treatment is yet available besides lung transplantation for the most severe cases. Conclusion: Research around surfactant is evolving and recent developments include further evolution of synthetic surfactants, evaluation of surfactant as a therapeutic option in lung diseases other than RDS and the discovery of genetic disorders of surfactant metabolism. Ongoing research is essential to continue to improve therapeutic prospects for children with serious respiratory disease involving disturbances in surfactant.","Been, Jasper V.; Zimmermann, Luc J.

It is important to be acquainted with new causes of infection which include Legionella species, Chlamydia pneumoniae, diphtheroids in certain instances (Corynebacterium pseudodiphtheriticum), and viruses such as the Hanta strains. Infections with Bordetella pertussis are increasing. However, the ever present and most common cause of CAP, Streptococcus pneumoniae, continues to present problems because of increasing antibiotic resistance, the high case fatality rate when bacteremia accompanies pneumonia, and the inability to give prophylactic immunization to all people with risk factors for this infection.","Reynolds, H.

These mAbs were successfully used for detection and quantification of ACE by ELISA, Western blotting, flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. In all these applications mainly single mAbs were used. We hypothesized that we can obtain a completely new kind of information about ACE structure and function if we use the whole set of mAbs directed to different epitopes on the ACE molecule. When we finished epitope mapping of all mAbs to ACE (and especially, those recognizing conformational epitopes), we realized that we had obtained a new tool to study ACE. First, we demonstrated that binding of some mAbs is very sensitive to local conformational changes on the ACE surface—due to local denaturation, inactivation, ACE inhibitor or mAbs binding or due to diseases. Second, we were able to detect, localize and characterize several human ACE mutations. And, finally, we established a new concept—conformational fingerprinting of ACE using mAbs that in turn allowed us to obtain evidence for tissue specificity of ACE, which has promising scientific and diagnostic perspectives. The initial goal for the generation of mAbs to ACE 30 years ago was obtaining mAbs to organ-specific endothelial cells, which could be used for organ-specific drug delivery. Our systematic work on characterization of mAbs to numerous epitopes on ACE during these years has lead not only to the generation of the most effective mAbs for specific drug/gene delivery into the lung capillaries, but also to the establishment of the concept of conformational fingerprinting of ACE, which in turn gives a theoretical base for the generation of mAbs, specific for ACE from different organs. We believe that this concept could be applicable for any glycoprotein against which there is a set of mAbs to different epitopes.","Danilov, S. M.",Mol Biol,96,8
7097,7097,7097,Abstract,14.543341,7.78814,2005,"The known cysteine peptidases have been classified into 35 sequence families. We argue that these have arisen from at least five separate evolutionary origins, each of which is represented by a set of one or more modern-day families, termed a clan. Clan CA is the largest, containing the papain family, C1, and others with the Cys/His catalytic dyad. Clan CB (His/Cys dyad) contains enzymes from RNA viruses that are distantly related to chymotrypsin. The peptidases of clan CC are also from RNA viruses, but have papain-like Cys/His catalytic sites. Clans CD and CE contain only one family each, those of interleukin-1β-converting enzyme and adenovirus L3 proteinase, respectively. A few families cannot yet be assigned to clans. In view of the number of separate origins of enzymes of this type, one should be cautious in generalising about the catalytic mechanisms and other properties of cysteine peptidases as a whole. In contrast, it may be safer to generalise for enzymes within a single family or clan.","Barrett, Alan J.; Rawlings, Neil D.",Perspect Drug Discov Des,96,1

One RNA replicon contained an internal direct repeat of 476 nucleotides from the 3′ end of the 30-kDa ORF. Although this RNA was replicated, most of the progeny were heterogeneous in size and smaller than the original transcript. A second TMV-derived RNA replicon, without any internally repeated sequences and containing a deletion of the 5′ portion of the 30-kDa ORF as well as most of the 126/183-kDa ORF, was created and coinoculated with wild type TMV as helper. This RNA also was replicated efficiently and systemically invaded tobacco plants. An examination of the sequences of cDNA clones obtained after PCR amplification of the progeny population of this RNA replicon demonstrated that the observed size heterogeneity was due to deletions and insertions adjacent to the artificially created deletion junction. These data demonstrate that a TMV infection is capable of supporting an artificially created RNA replicon, similar to defective interfering RNAs or satellites. However, these dependent RNAs were replicated without noticeably interfering with wild type TMV symptoms or replication.","Raffo, Anthony J.; Dawson, William O.",Virology,96,17

As part of a wider study examining regeneration pathways in monsoon rain forest vegetation in northern Australia, a one‐off, dry season census of saplings was undertaken along transects sampled at each of 33 relatively undisturbed sites broadly representative of the range of regional monsoon rain forest vegetation. Four floristic quadrat groups were derived through TWINSPAN classification. Subsequent analyses involved: (1) comparison of mean dry season stockings of juveniles occurring in different rain forest types, and their structural and environmental correlates; (2) comparison of the contributions of different life forms, and the influence of clonal reproduction in the sapling regeneration banks of different forest types; and (3) exploration of relationships between the distributions of saplings of common tree species with respect to seed bank, floristic, structural, and environmental variables. While data presented here require cautious interpretation given that processes of seedling/sapling recruitment and mortality are highly dynamic, sapling banks were found to be most dense on coarse‐textured, moist soils, and least dense on coarse‐textured, seasonally dry soils. Canopy cover and fire impact were shown to be highly influential on sapling distribution, especially for saplings of tree species and those growing on seasonally dry sites. Sapling densities were little influenced by proximity to rain forest margins, except for shrubs. The potential for clonal reproduction was significantly greater on dry sites, especially for trees. The majority of saplings sampled were derived from relatively few common, non‐clonal, canopy tree species. Sapling distributions of 20 out of 23 common tree species were clumped in the vicinity of conspecific adults; for most species the strength of this relationship was greater than that for any other variable. These data support observations in the literature concerning the distribution of sapling banks in moist and dry tropical forests.","Jeremy, Russell‐Smith",J Veg Sci,96,22

Although the phagocytic functions of isolated Mθ from kittens and adults were equivalent, the mean FeLV susceptibility of Mθ from kittens was five times that of Mθ from adult cats, thus establishing a direct correlation between the age-related susceptibility of cats and Mθ from cats to FeLV. Mθ of viremic cats were found to be infected with FeLV in vivo; virus titers were slightly higher than those obtained after in vitro infection of Mθ. Mθ from cats that had experienced regressive FeLV infection were not significantly more resistant to FeLV infection in vitro than were Mθ from naive adult specific-pathogen-free cats. HC, which has been shown to enhance the in vivo FeLV susceptibility of cats, also enhanced the permissiveness of Mθ from cats to FeLV in vitro (600-fold for Mθ from adult cats and 200-fold for Mθ) from kittens. Mθ permissiveness to FeLV was highly sensitive to HC and occurred in Mθ infected in vivo or in vitro. In parallel with the effect of HC on the natural resistance of cats to FeLV, administration of silica before virus inoculation also markedly enhanced the FeLV susceptibility of adult cats. Silica was toxic for isolated Mθ but not for lymphocytes in vitro, and silica produced monocytopenia and neutrophilia, delayed skin allograft rejection, and augmented feline oncovirus-associated cell membrane antigen antibody responses in vivo. These experiments indicate that Mθ were linked to the natural resistance of cats to FeLV and that the temporary elimination of Mθ functions (e.g., by silica) and/or the conversion of the Mθ-FeLV relationship from a nonpermissive to a permissive state (e.g., by corticosteroids) resulted in failure of early virus containment, in persistent virus amplification in hemolymphatic tissues, and in subsequent FeLV-related proliferative or antiproliferative disease.","Hoover, Edward A.; Rojko, Jennifer L.; Wilson, Pamela L.; Olsen, Richard G.",J Natl Cancer Inst,96,28

However, comparable dosages for haplo-HSCT remain unclear. We compared and evaluated the effects of ATG-T (7.5 mg/kg) or ATG-F (20 mg/kg) dosages in a relatively homogenous population in haplotype HSCT settings. Patients administered ATG-T 7.5 mg/kg (n = 81) or ATG-F 20 mg/kg (n = 35) as part of GVHD prophylaxis during haplo-HSCT were enrolled. Incidence and severity of GVHD, Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) infection, and immune cell recovery were compared using the Mann-Whitney U rank test and chi-square test. Cumulative incidences of GVHD, EBV infection and its subgroups, and relapse mortality were computed; overall survival (OS) was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method, with the log-rank test used for univariate comparison. Risk factors for OS were analyzed by the Cox proportional hazards model. Incidence and cumulative incidence of all grades of acute GVHD and subgroups were comparable in both groups (all p > 0.05); however, cumulative incidence of any grade and limited chronic GVHD was significantly higher in the ATG-T group (p = 0.002, p = 0.007, respectively). Cumulative incidences of EBV infections, EBV-DNAemia, and EBV-related diseases were similar; relapse mortality and OS rates were comparable between both groups (all p > 0.05). ATG-T dosage (7.5 mg/kg) appeared comparable to ATG-F dosage (20 mg/kg) for haplo-HSCT. Currently approved ATG-T and ATG-F doses appear efficient to balance the risk–benefit ratio of GVHD, OS, relapse mortality, and EBV infection in haplo-HSCT.","Zhou, Ling; Gao, Zhi-yong; Lu, Dao-pei",Ann Hematol,96,1

In Uruguay, BVDV seroprevalence at the farm level is >80%. In this work, 2546 serum, blood or tissue samples collected from animals suspected of being affected by BVD between 2015 and 2017 were analyzed by reverse transcription PCR and sequencing. Analysis of the BVDV genomic regions 5’UTR/N(pro), N(pro) and E2 revealed that BVDV-1a, 1i and 2b circulate in the country, with BVDV-1a being the most prevalent subtype. Population dynamics studies revealed that BVDV-1a has been circulating in our herds since ~1990. This subtype began to spread and evolve, accumulating point mutations at a rate of 3.48 × 10(−3) substitutions/site/year, acquiring specific genetic characteristics that gave rise to two local genetic lineages of BVDV-1a. These lineages are divergent from those circulating worldwide, as well as the vaccine strain currently used in Uruguay. The most notable differences between field and vaccine strains were found in the E2 glycoprotein, suggesting that the amino acid substitutions could result in failure of cross-protection/neutralization after vaccination. This is the first study that compares Uruguayan BVDV field and vaccine strains with other BVDV strains from throughout the world. The results obtained in this study will be very useful for developing a suitable immunization program for BVDV in Uruguay by identifying local field strains as candidates for vaccine development.

Annually, around 200 million fall ill, and around 500,000 persons die as a result of this infection. Mainly children are the victims. In order to control and eventually prevent any new infection, the development of effective vaccines is pivotal. In this review, background information about the history of vaccine development and malaria disease as well as possibilities for therapy and control is given. In the main part of the article, an update on the development of vaccines against Plasmodium falciparum is provided followed by an extensive discussion. Malaria is a parasitic infectious disease caused by the single cell organism Plasmodium. Five different Plasmodium species can induce disease in humans with P. falciparum being the origin for more than 99% of infections in Africa. The vector is the Anopheles mosquito. The life cycle of Plasmodium offers several approaches for vaccines to have an impact. Out of around 70 candidates, pre-erythrocytic vaccine candidates interfering with the liver phase of the parasite are the most developed. However, a vaccine with more than 75% efficacy, as required by the World Health Organization (WHO), is not yet in sight. Currently, for the first time, a moderately efficacious vaccine (RTS,S/AS01) is being applied in large-scale operations. But it is obvious that malaria can only be controlled in combination with concurring measures. For example, the use of impregnated mosquito nets, indoor residual spraying, elimination of vector breeding sites, rapid diagnosis, and therapy of the infection as well as a functioning health system are important elements, which can hardly be guaranteed in areas characterized by poverty.","Metzger, Wolfram Gottfried; Sulyok, Zita; Theurer, Antje; Köhler, Carsten",Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz,96,1

DNA methylation markers have been demonstrated to provide accurate age estimation in forensics, but there is growing evidence that DNA methylation can be modified by various factors including diseases. We analyzed DNA methylation profile in five markers from five different genes (ELOVL2, C1orf132, KLF14, FHL2, and TRIM59) used for forensic age prediction in three groups of individuals with diagnosed medical conditions. The obtained results showed that the selected age-related CpG sites have unchanged age prediction capacity in the group of late onset Alzheimer’s disease patients. Aberrant hypermethylation and decreased prediction accuracy were found for TRIM59 and KLF14 markers in the group of early onset Alzheimer’s disease suggesting accelerated aging of patients. In the Graves’ disease patients, altered DNA methylation profile and modified age prediction accuracy were noted for TRIM59 and FHL2 with aberrant hypermethylation observed for the former and aberrant hypomethylation for the latter.

In this review we consider the gaps in our knowledge in the use of BoNT-A and reasons why muscle morphology and function in children with cerebral palsy are impaired. We review limitations in our knowledge regarding the mechanisms underlying the development of contractures and the difficulty in preventing them. It is clear from this review that injection of BoNT-A in the large muscles of both the upper and lower limbs of children with cerebral palsy will result in a predictable decrease in muscle activity, which is usually reported as a reduction in spasticity, for between 3 and 6 months. These changes are noted by the use of clinical tools such as the Modified Ashworth Scale and the Modified Tardieu Scale. Decreased muscle over-activity usually results in improved range of motion in distal joints. Injection of the gastrocnemius muscle for toe-walking in a child with hemiplegia or diplegia usually has the effect of increasing the passive range of dorsiflexion at the ankle. In our review, we found that this may result in a measurable improvement in gait by the use of observational gait scales or gait analysis, in some children. However, improvements in gait function are not always achieved and are small in magnitude and short lived. We found that some of the differences in outcomes in clinical trials may relate to the use of adjunctive interventions such as serial casting, orthoses, night splints and intensive therapy. We note that the majority of clinical trials of the use of BoNT-A in children with cerebral palsy have focussed on a single injection cycle and this is insufficient to understand the balance between benefit and harm. Most outcomes were reported in terms of changes in muscle tone and there were fewer studies with robust methodology that reported improvements in function. Changes in the domains of activities and participation have rarely been reported in studies to date. There were no clinical reviews to date that consider the findings of studies in human volunteers and in experimental animals and their relevance to clinical protocols. In this review we found that studies in human volunteers and in experimental animals show muscle atrophy after an injection of BoNT-A for at least 12 months. Muscle atrophy was accompanied by loss of contractile elements in muscle and replacement with fat and connective tissue. It is not currently known if these changes, mediated at a molecular level, are reversible. We conclude that there is a need to revise clinical protocols by using BoNT-A more thoughtfully, less frequently and with greatly enhanced monitoring of the effects on injected muscle for both short-term and long-term benefits and harms.","Multani, Iqbal; Manji, Jamil; Hastings-Ison, Tandy; Khot, Abhay; Graham, Kerr",Paediatr Drugs,96,11

If lethality is complete, releasing this strain should only reduce population size and not affect the genetics of the target populations. Approximately 450 thousand males of this strain were released each week for 27 months in Jacobina, Bahia, Brazil. We genotyped the release strain and the target Jacobina population before releases began for >21,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Genetic sampling from the target population six, 12, and 27–30 months after releases commenced provides clear evidence that portions of the transgenic strain genome have been incorporated into the target population. Evidently, rare viable hybrid offspring between the release strain and the Jacobina population are sufficiently robust to be able to reproduce in nature. The release strain was developed using a strain originally from Cuba, then outcrossed to a Mexican population. Thus, Jacobina Ae. aegypti are now a mix of three populations. It is unclear how this may affect disease transmission or affect other efforts to control these dangerous vectors. These results highlight the importance of having in place a genetic monitoring program during such releases to detect un-anticipated outcomes.","Evans, Benjamin R.; Kotsakiozi, Panayiota; Costa-da-Silva, Andre Luis; Ioshino, Rafaella Sayuri; Garziera, Luiza; Pedrosa, Michele C.; Malavasi, Aldo; Virginio, Jair F.; Capurro, Margareth L.; Powell, Jeffrey R.",Sci Rep,96,11

Although the beneficial effects of healthy lifestyle have been described, the beneficial epigenetic modifications induced by dietary and exercise intervention in BC patients have not been elucidated yet. On these bases, the aim of the present study was to computationally identify microRNAs (miRNAs) strictly associated with BC progression and with dietary and exercise interventions. Through several computational approaches, a set of miRNAs modulated by diet and exercise and useful as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for BC was identified. The results obtained represent the starting point for further validation analyses performed on BC patients undergoing lifestyle interventions to propose the miRNAs here identified as novel biomarkers for BC management. ABSTRACT: Background: Several studies have shown that healthy lifestyles prevent the risk of breast cancer (BC) and are associated with better prognosis. It was hypothesized that lifestyle strategies induce microRNA (miRNA) modulation that, in turn, may lead to important epigenetic modifications. The identification of miRNAs associated with BC, diet, and physical activity may give further insights into the role played by lifestyle interventions and their efficacy for BC patients. To predict which miRNAs may be modulated by diet and physical activity in BC patients, the analyses of different miRNA expression datasets were performed. Methods: The GEO DataSets database was used to select miRNA expression datasets related to BC patients, dietary interventions, and physical exercise. Further bioinformatic approaches were used to establish the value of selected miRNAs in BC development and prognosis. Results: The analysis of datasets allowed the selection of modulated miRNAs associated with BC development, diet, and physical exercise. Seven miRNAs were also associated with the overall survival of BC patients. Conclusions: The identified miRNAs may play a role in the development of BC and may have a prognostic value in patients treated with integrative interventions including diet and physical activity. Validation of such modulated miRNAs on BC patients undergoing lifestyle strategies will be mandatory.","Falzone, Luca; Grimaldi, Maria; Celentano, Egidio; Augustin, Livia S.

A MenB vaccine directed against the polysaccharide capsule remains elusive due to poor immunogenicity and safety concerns. The vaccines licensed for the prevention of MenB disease, 4CMenB (Bexsero) and MenB-fHbp (Trumenba), are serogroup B ‘substitute’ vaccines, comprised of subcapsular proteins and are designed to provide protection against most MenB disease-causing strains. In many high-income countries, such as the UK, adolescents are at increased risk of IMD and have the highest rates of meningococcal carriage. Beginning in the late 1990s, immunisation of this age group with the meningococcal group C conjugate vaccine reduced asymptomatic carriage and disrupted transmission of this organism, resulting in lower group C IMD incidence across all age groups. Whether vaccinating teenagers with the novel ‘MenB’ protein-based vaccines will prevent acquisition or reduce duration of carriage and generate herd protection was unknown at the time of vaccine introduction and could not be inferred from the effects of the conjugate vaccines. 4CMenB and MenB-fHbp may also impact on non-MenB disease-causing capsular groups as well as commensal Neisseria spp. This study will evaluate the impact of vaccination with 4CMenB or MenB-fHbp on oropharyngeal carriage of pathogenic meningococci in teenagers, and consequently the potential for these vaccines to provide broad community protection against MenB disease. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The ‘Be on the TEAM’ (Teenagers Against Meningitis) Study is a pragmatic, partially randomised controlled trial of 24 000 students aged 16–19 years in their penultimate year of secondary school across the UK with regional allocation to a 0+6 month schedule of 4CMenB or MenB-fHbp or to a control group. Culture-confirmed oropharyngeal carriage will be assessed at baseline and at 12 months, following which the control group will be eligible for 4CMenB vaccination. The primary outcome is the carriage prevalence of potentially pathogenic meningococci (defined as those with genogroups B, C, W, Y or X), in each vaccine group compared separately to the control group at 12 months post-enrolment, that is, 12 months after the first vaccine dose and 6 months after the second vaccine dose. Secondary outcomes include impact on carriage of: genogroup B meningococci; hyperinvasive meningococci; all meningococci; those meningococci expressing vaccine antigens and; other Neisseria spp. A sample size of 8000 in each arm will provide 80% power to detect a 30% reduction in meningococcal carriage, assuming genogroup B, C, W, Y or X meningococci carriage of 3.43%, a design effect of 1.5, a retention rate of 80% and a significance level of 0.05. Study results will be available in 2021 and will inform the UK and international immunisation policy and future vaccine development. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study is approved by the National Health Service South Central Research Ethics Committee (18/SC/0055); the UK Health Research Authority (IRAS ID 239091) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency.

Long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) has been implicated in tumorigenesis. The aim of the present study was to elucidate the potential diagnostic and prognostic values of lncRNA FRGCA in COAD. The data of 438 COAD patients were retrieved for analysis. Diagnostic significance was evaluated using tumor and nontumor tissues. Prognostic significance was evaluated using a Cox proportional regression model. Stratified analysis was performed to identify associations between clinical factors and lncRNA FRGCA expression. A nomogram was constructed using the clinical factors and lncRNA FRGCA for survival prediction. Enrichment analysis identified gene ontologies and metabolic pathways of mRNAs with high Pearson correlation coefficients with lncRNA FRGCA. lncRNA FRGCA was highly expressed in tumor tissues of COAD and demonstrated diagnostic value (area under curve = 0.763, P < .0001). Prognostic significance analysis indicated that lncRNA FRGCA had prognostic value in COAD [adjusted P < .001, hazard ratio (HR) = 0.444, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 0.288–0.685] and high expression of lncRNA FRGCA indicated better survival in COAD. A nomogram was evaluated for prediction of survival at 1, 3, and 5 years. Enrichment analysis revealed many mRNAs involved in the structural constituents of the mitochondrial inner membrane and translational termination, protein binding, translation, ribosome, oxidative phosphorylation, and metabolic pathways, especially the nucleoplasm. Differentially expressed in tumor vs nontumor tissues, lncRNA FRGCA had both diagnostic and prognostic implications in COAD, which may be associated with ribosome metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, and nucleoplasm-related metabolic pathways.","Liao, Cun; Guo, Yun; Gong, Yizhen; Huang, Xue; Liao, Xiwen; Wang, Xiangkun; Ruan, Guotian; Gao, Feng",Medicine (Baltimore),96,8

Cannabis use has been tied to schizophrenia-like symptoms, indicating that dysregulated endogenous cannabinoid signaling may be causally linked to schizophrenia. Previously, we reported that glutamatergic neuron-selective ablation of Lmo4, an endogenous inhibitor of the tyrosine phosphatase PTP1B, impairs endocannabinoid (eCB) production from the metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR5. These Lmo4-deficient mice display anxiety-like behaviors that are alleviated by local shRNA knockdown or pharmacological inhibition of PTP1B that restores mGluR5-dependent eCB production in the amygdala. Here, we report that these Lmo4-deficient mice also display schizophrenia-like behaviors: impaired working memory assessed in the Y maze and defective sensory gating by prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startle response. Modulation of inhibitory inputs onto layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons of the prefrontal cortex relies on eCB signaling from the brain-derived neurotrophic factor receptor trkB, rather than mGluR5, and this mechanism was defective in Lmo4-deficient mice. Genetic ablation of PTP1B in the glutamatergic neurons lacking Lmo4 restored tyrosine phosphorylation of trkB, trkB-mediated eCB signaling, and ameliorated schizophrenia-like behaviors. Pharmacological inhibition of PTP1B with trodusquemine also restored trkB phosphorylation and improved schizophrenia-like behaviors by restoring eCB signaling, since the CB1 receptor antagonist 1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-5-(4-iodophenyl)-4-methyl-N-1-piperidinyl-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxamide blocked this effect. Thus, activation of PTP1B in pyramidal neurons contributes to schizophrenia-like behaviors in Lmo4-deficient mice and genetic or pharmacological intervention targeting PTP1B ameliorates schizophrenia-related deficits.","Qin, Zhaohong; Zhang, Li; Cruz, Shelly A.; Stewart, Alexandre F.

METHODS: AAU patients and healthy individuals were recruited from October 2016 to August 2017 at the Department of Uveitis, in the Eye Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University. Related demographic, clinical characteristics, and therapeutic data were analyzed. RESULTS: One hundred and eight AAU patients and 18 healthy controls were included in this study. Serum SAA levels in AAU patients were significantly higher than those of healthy controls (p all < 0.0001). Significantly higher SAA levels were found in AS(+)AAU patients than those in AS(−)AAU patients (p < 0.05). SAA levels were also significantly higher in patients with HLA-B27(+)AAU compared with those with HLA-B27(−)AAU (p < 0.05). Furthermore, in each of the AAU subgroups, higher SAA levels were observed in the active state than those in the inactive state (p all < 0.05). In addition, SAA levels were positively correlated to anterior chamber cell counts (r = 0.492, p < 0.0001). ROC curve analysis revealed that SAA had an AUC value of 0.727 for detecting active inflammation (Youden’s index = 0.38). SAA decreased with effective treatments (p = 0.0002). CONCLUSION: Serum levels of SAA were elevated in AAU patients. The increased levels of SAA were correlated with AS and HLA-B27 status. SAA levels were also positively correlated to disease activity and decreased with effective treatments. These findings suggest that SAA is associated with AAU, with a potential role in monitoring inflammatory processes and assessing the efficacy of therapy.","Dai, Ma-Li; Fan, Shipei; Li, Zhuoran; Yu, Xuewen; Lin, Dan; Huang, Xiu-Feng; Wang, Yuqin",Eye (Lond),96,1

The engagement of TLR4, a canonical pattern recognition receptor, has been proposed to trigger inflammatory responses with different magnitudes and durations depending on TLR4 cellular compartmentalization. In the present study, we identify an unexpected role of Lamtor5, a newly identified component of the amino acid-sensing machinery, in modulating TLR4 signaling and controlling inflammation. Specifically, Lamtor5 associated with TLR4 via their LZ/TIR domains and facilitated their colocalization at autolysosomes, preventing lysosomal tethering and the activation of mTORC1 upon LPS stimulation and thereby derepressing TFEB to promote autophagic degradation of TLR4. The loss of Lamtor5 was unable to trigger the TFEB-driven autolysosomal pathway and delay degradation of TLR4, leading to sustained inflammation and hence increased mortality among Lamtor5 haploinsufficient mice during endotoxic shock. Intriguingly, nutrient deprivation, particularly leucine deprivation, blunted inflammatory signaling and conferred protection to endotoxic mice. This effect, however, was largely abrogated upon Lamtor5 deletion. We thus propose a homeostatic function of Lamtor5 that couples pathogenic insults and nutrient availability to optimize the inflammatory response; this function may have implications for TLR4-associated inflammatory and metabolic disorders.","Zhang, Wei; Zhuang, Ningtong; Liu, Xiaoyi; He, Long; He, Yan; Mahinthichaichan, Paween; Zhang, Hang; Kang, Yanhua; Lu, Yin; Wu, Qinan; Xu, Dakang; Shi, Liyun",Cell Mol Immunol,96,1

Here, we show that the selective T cell expression of CMIP, a new adapter protein, by targeted transgenesis drives T cells toward a naïve phenotype. We found that CMIP inhibits activation of the Src kinases Fyn and Lck after CD3/CD28 costimulation and the subsequent localization of Fyn and Lck to LRs. Video microscopy analysis showed that CMIP blocks the recruitment of LAT and the lipid raft marker cholera toxin B at the site of TCR engagement. Proteomic analysis identified several protein clusters differentially modulated by CMIP and, notably, Cofilin-1, which is inactivated in CMIP-expressing T cells. Moreover, transgenic T cells exhibited the downregulation of GM3 synthase, a key enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of gangliosides. These results suggest that CMIP negatively impacts proximal signaling and cytoskeletal rearrangement and defines a new mechanism for the negative regulation of T cells that could be a therapeutic target.","Oniszczuk, Julie; Sendeyo, Kelhia; Chhuon, Cerina; Savas, Berkan; Cogné, Etienne; Vachin, Pauline; Henique, Carole; Guerrera, Ida Chiara; Astarita, Giuseppe; Frontera, Vincent; Pawlak, Andre; Audard, Vincent; Sahali, Dil; Ollero, Mario",Cell Mol Immunol,96,1

In this work the mechanism of formation of cell membrane nanovesicles (CNVs) was studied experimentally and theoretically. CNVs were isolated by centrifugation and washing of blood cells and observed by optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The shape of the biological membrane in the budding process, as observed in phospholipid vesicles, in erythrocytes and in CNVs, was described by an unifying model. Taking the mean curvature h and the curvature deviator d of the membrane surface as the relevant parameters, the shape and the distribution of membrane constituents were determined theoretically by minimization of membrane free energy. Considering these results and previous results on vesiculation of red blood cells it was interpreted that the budding processes may lead to formation of different types of CNVs as regards the compartment (exo/endovesicles), shape (spherical/tubular/torocytic) and composition (enriched/depleted in particular kinds of molecules). It was concluded that the specificity of pinched off nanovesicles derives from the shape of the membrane constituents and not primarily from their chemical identity, which explains evidences on great heterogeneity of isolated extracellular vesicles with respect to composition.","Kralj-Iglič, Veronika; Pocsfalvi, Gabriella; Mesarec, Luka; Šuštar, Vid; Hägerstrand, Henry; Iglič, Aleš",PLoS One,96,22

The assessment of detailed infectious profiles is an important part of this effort. Household transmission data play a key role in estimating such profiles. We used diagnostic and questionnaire-based data on influenza patients at a Japanese clinic to estimate the detailed infectious period (as well as incubation period, symptomatic and infectious periods, and extended infectious period after recovery) and the secondary attack ratio (SAR) of influenza for households of various sizes based on a modified Cauchemez-type model. RESULTS: The data were from enrolled patients with confirmed influenza who were treated at the Hirotsu Clinic (Kawasaki, Japan) with a neuraminidase inhibitor (NAI) during six northern hemisphere influenza seasons between 2010 and 2016. A total of 2342 outpatients, representing 1807 households, were included. For influenza type A, the average incubation period was 1.43 days (95% probability interval, 0.03–5.32 days). The estimated average symptomatic and infective period was 1.76 days (0.33–4.62 days); the extended infective period after recovery was 0.25 days. The estimated SAR rose from 20 to 32% as household size increased from 3 to 5. For influenza type B, the average incubation period, average symptomatic and infective period, and extended infective period were estimated as 1.66 days (0.21–4.61), 2.62 days (0.54–5.75) and 1.00 days, respectively. The SAR increased from 12 to 21% as household size increased from 3 to 5. CONCLUSION: All estimated periods of influenza type B were longer than the corresponding periods for type A. However, the SAR for type B was less than that for type A. These results may reflect Japanese demographics and treatment policy.

Here, in three experiments, we built on previous interactive tasks to create an online foraging game for studying divided attention in human participants exposed to the (simulated) risk of predation. Participants used a “sheep” icon to collect items from different target categories randomly distributed across the display. Each trial also contained “wolf” objects, whose movement was inspired by classic studies of multiple object tracking. When participants needed to physically avoid the wolves, foraging patterns changed, with an increased tendency to switch between target categories and a decreased ability to prioritise high reward targets, relative to participants who could safely ignore them. However, when the wolves became dangerous by periodically changing form (briefly having big eyes) instead of by approaching the sheep, foraging patterns were unaffected. Spatial disruption caused by the need to rapidly shift position—rather the cost of reallocating attention—therefore appears to influence foraging in this context. These results thus confirm that participants can efficiently alternate between target selection and tracking moving objects, replicating earlier single-target search findings. Future studies may need to increase the perceived risk or potential costs associated with simulated danger, in order to elicit the extended run behaviour predicted by animal models of foraging, but absent in the current data.","Thornton, Ian M.; Tagu, Jérôme; Zdravković, Sunčica; Kristjánsson, Árni",Cogn Res Princ Implic,96,1

While amplicon methods are fast, low-cost, and have curated reference databases, they can suffer from amplification bias and are limited in genomic scope. In contrast, shotgun metagenomic methods sample more genomic regions with fewer sequence acquisition biases, but are much more expensive (even with moderate sequencing depth) and computationally challenging. Here, we develop a set of 16S rRNA sequence capture baits that offer a potential middle ground with the advantages from both approaches for investigating microbial communities. These baits cover the diversity of all 16S rRNA sequences available in the Greengenes (v. 13.5) database, with no sequence having <78% sequence identity to at least one bait for all segments of 16S. The use of our baits provide comparable results to 16S amplicon libraries and shotgun metagenomic libraries when assigning taxonomic units from 16S sequences within the metagenomic reads. We demonstrate that 16S rRNA capture baits can be used on a range of microbial samples (i.e., mock communities and rodent fecal samples) to increase the proportion of 16S rRNA sequences (average > 400-fold) and decrease analysis time to obtain consistent community assessments. Furthermore, our study reveals that bioinformatic methods used to analyze sequencing data may have a greater influence on estimates of community composition than library preparation method used, likely due in part to the extent and curation of the reference databases considered. Thus, enriching existing aliquots of shotgun metagenomic libraries and obtaining modest numbers of reads from them offers an efficient orthogonal method for assessment of bacterial community composition.","Beaudry, Megan S.; Wang, Jincheng; Kieran, Troy J.; Thomas, Jesse; Bayona-Vásquez, Natalia J.; Gao, Bei; Devault, Alison; Brunelle, Brian; Lu, Kun; Wang, Jia-Sheng; Rhodes, Olin E.; Glenn, Travis C.",Front Microbiol,96,1

There is a well-recognised link between the ADAM17 substrate tumour necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and obesity, inflammation and diabetes. In addition, knocking out ADAM17 in mice leads to an extremely lean phenotype. Importantly, ADAM17-deficient mice exhibit one of the most pronounced examples of hypermetabolism in rodents to date. It is vital to further understand the mechanistic role that ADAM17 plays in the metabolic syndrome. Such studies will demonstrate that ADAM17 is a valuable therapeutic target to treat obesity and diabetes.","Matthews, Jennifer; Villescas, Sofia; Herat, Lakshini; Schlaich, Markus; Matthews, Vance",Biosci Rep,96,1

Despite the impact of social expectations on toilet usage, few programs and studies have developed theoretically grounded norm-centric behavior change interventions to increase toilet use in low-income settings. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper is to detail the rationale and design of an ex ante, parallel cluster-randomized trial evaluating the impact of a demand-side, norm-centric behavior change intervention on exclusive toilet use and maintenance in peri-urban Tamil Nadu, India. METHODS: Following formative research, we developed an evidence-based norm-centric behavior change intervention called Nam Nalavazhvu (Tamil for “our well-being”). The multilevel intervention aims to improve toilet usage by shifting empirical expectations or beliefs about other relevant people’s sanitation practices. It also provides action-oriented information to aid individuals to set goals and overcome barriers to own, consistently use, and maintain their toilets. This trial includes 76 wards in the Pudukkottai and Karur districts, where half were randomly assigned to receive the intervention and the remaining served as counterfactuals. RESULTS: We enrolled wards and conducted a baseline survey among randomly selected individuals in all 76 wards. The 1-year behavior change intervention is currently ongoing. At the endline, we will collect relevant data and compare results between study arms to determine the impacts of the Nam Nalavazhvu intervention on sanitation-related behavioral, health, and well-being outcomes and potential moderators. This study is powered to detect differences in the prevalence of exclusive toilet use between study arms. We are also conducting a process evaluation to understand the extent to which the intervention was implemented as designed, given the special pandemic context. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this trial will inform norm-centric behavior change strategies to improve exclusive toilet usage.

It is of great significance for epidemic monitoring and prevention and control of infectious diseases by the development of a rapid, specific, and sensitive quantitative PCR method to detect two pathogens simultaneously. METHODS: Primers and TaqMan probes were designed according to highly conserved sequences of these viruses. Sensitivity, specificity, linear range, limit of detection, and the effects of hemolysis and lipid on real‐time qPCR were evaluated. RESULTS: The linearity of the curve allowed quantification of nucleic acid concentrations in range from 10(3) to 10(9) copies/ml per reaction (MARV and EBOV). The limit of detection of EBOV was 40 copies/ml, and MARV was 100 copies/ml. It has no cross‐reaction with other pathogens such as hepatitis b virus (HBV), hepatitis c virus (HCV), human papillomavirus (HPV), Epstein‐Barr virus (EBV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Repeatability analysis of the two viruses showed that their coefficient of variation (CV) was less than 5.0%. The above results indicated that fluorescence quantitative PCR could detect EBOV and MARV sensitively and specifically. CONCLUSIONS: The TaqMan probe‐based multiplex fluorescence quantitative PCR assays could detect EBOV and MARV sensitively specifically and simultaneously.","Yu, Zhikang; Wu, Heming; Huang, Qingyan; Zhong, Zhixiong",J Clin Lab Anal,96,1

The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant (FDNPP) disaster resulted in public anxiety toward nuclear power and radiation worldwide. YouTube is an important source of information about the FDNPP disaster for the world. OBJECTIVE: This study's objectives were to examine the characteristics of YouTube videos related to the FDNPP disaster, analyze the content and comments of videos with a quantitative method, and determine which features contribute to making a video popular with audiences. This study is the first to examine FDNPP disaster–related videos on YouTube. METHODS: We searched for the term “Fukushima nuclear disaster” on YouTube on November 2, 2019. The first 60 eligible videos in the relevance, upload date, view count, and rating categories were recorded. ﻿Videos that were irrelevant, were non-English, had inappropriate words, were machine synthesized, and were <3 minutes long were excluded. In total, 111 videos met the inclusion criteria. Parameters of the videos, including the number of subscribers, length, the number of days since the video was uploaded, region, video popularity (views, views/day, likes, likes/day, dislikes, dislikes/day, comments, comments/day), the tone of the videos, the top ten comments, affiliation, whether Japanese people participated in the video, whether the video recorder visited Fukushima, whether the video contained theoretical knowledge, and whether the video contained information about the recent situation in Fukushima, were recorded. By using criteria for content and ﻿technical design, two evaluators scored videos and grouped them into the useful (score: 11-14), slightly useful (score: 6-10), and useless (score: 0-5) video categories. RESULTS: Of the 111 videos, 43 (38.7%) videos were useful, 43 (38.7%) were slightly useful, and 25 (22.5%) were useless. Useful videos had good visual and aural effects, provided vivid information on the Fukushima disaster, and had a mean score of 12 (SD 0.9). Useful videos had more views per day (P<.001), likes per day (P<.001), and comments per day (P=.02) than useless and slightly useful videos. The popularity of videos had a significant correlation with clear sounds (likes/day: P=.001; comments/day: P=.02), vivid information (likes/day: P<.001; comments/day: P=.007), understanding content (likes/day: P=.001; comments/day: P=.04). There was no significant difference in likes per day (P=.72) and comments per day (P=.11) between negative and neutral- and mixed-tone videos. Videos about the recent situation in Fukushima had more likes and comments per day. Video recorders who personally visited Fukushima Prefecture had more subscribers and received more views and likes. CONCLUSIONS: The possible features that made videos popular to the public included ﻿video quality, videos made in Fukushima, and information on the recent situation in Fukushima.

Candidate screening for subunit vaccines contributes to the prevention of this disease. Therefore, in this study, the inactivated G. parasuis reference serovar 5 strain (G. parasuis-5) was used to generate specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to screen subunit vaccine candidates. Six mAbs (1A12, 3E3, 4C6, 2D1, 3E6, and 4B2) were screened, and they all reacted with the G. parasuis serovar 5 strain according to laser confocal microscopy and flow cytometry (FCM). Indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) showed that one mAb 2D1, can react with all 15 reference serovars of G. parasuis. Protein mass spectrometry and Western blot analysis demonstrated that mAb 2D1 specifically reacts with Fe (3+) ABC transporter substrate-binding protein. A complement killing assay found that the colony numbers of bacteria were significantly reduced in the G. parasuis-5 group incubated with mAb 2D1 (p < 0.01) in comparison with the control group. Opsonophagocytic assays demonstrated that mAb 2D1 significantly enhanced the phagocytosis of 3D4/21 cells by G. parasuis (p < 0.05). RAW264.7 cells with stronger phagocytic ability were also used for the opsonophagocytic assay, and the difference was highly significant (p < 0.01). Passive immunization of mice revealed that mAb 2D1 can eliminate the bacteria in the blood and provide protection against G. parasuis-5. Our study found one mAb that can be used to prevent and control G. parasuis infection in vivo and in vitro, which may suggest that Fe (3+) ABC transporter substrate-binding protein is an immunodominant antigen and a promising candidate for subunit vaccine development.

Once the patients are admitted, they are more susceptible to further complications like sepsis and resultant increase in in-hospital mortality. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate risk factors associated with sepsis after trauma and death in trauma patients. METHODS: A total of 397 trauma patients were divided into 2 groups according to HbA1c level, HbA1c: <6.5% (n = 259), HbA1c: >6.5% (n = 138), and baseline clinical characteristics were collected. The independent risk factors of sepsis associated with trauma were screened using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to investigate risk factors for 30-day all-cause mortality. RESULTS: The sepsis incidence (76.1% vs 35.9%, P<0.001) and mortality rate (29.7% vs 7.3%, P<0.001) were significantly higher in HbA1c>6.5% group. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that the independent risk factors of sepsis after trauma were diabetes (OR: 3.1, 95% CI: 1.41–6.79), hypertension (OR: 2.55, 95% CI: 1.35–4.82), coagulation disorder (OR: 3.45, 95% CI: 1.23–9.67), creatinine (OR: 3.71, 95% CI: 1.66–8.31), urea nitrogen (OR: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.92–0.99), HbA1c%>6.5 (OR: 2.05, 95% CI: 1.65–2.54), increase in body mass index (OR: 1.08, 95% CI: 1.03–1.13) and lower initial GCS score (OR: 0.93, 95% CI: 0.88–0.99). Multivariable Cox proportional hazard analysis revealed that male (HR: 1.94, 95% CI: 1.21–3.12), HbA1c >6.5% (HR: 1.45, 95% CI: 1.32–1.6), albumin (HR: 0.54, 95% CI: 0.34–0.86), creatinine (HR: 1.02, 95% CI: 1.01–1.03), APTT (HR: 1.02, 95% CI: 1.01–1.03), SOFA score (HR: 1.2, 95% CI: 1.1–1.31), age >65 years (HR: 3.21, 95% CI: 1.95–5.3) were independent risk factor for trauma patients’ mortality.

However, estimating this value is particularly challenging owing to the characteristics of epidemic data, including non-reproducibility and incompleteness. METHODS: In this study, we propose mathematical models with different population structures; each of these models can produce data on the number of cases of the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 epidemic in South Korea. These structured models incorporating the heterogeneity of age and region are used to estimate the reproduction numbers at various terminal times. Subsequently, the age- and region-specific reproduction numbers are also computed to analyze the differences illustrated in the incidence data. RESULTS: Incorporation of the age-structure or region-structure allows for robust estimation of parameters, while the basic SIR model provides estimated values beyond the reasonable range with severe fluctuation. The estimated duration of infectious period using age-structured model is around 3.8 and the reproduction number was estimated to be 1.6. The estimated duration of infectious period using region-structured model is around 2.1 and the reproduction number was estimated to be 1.4. The estimated age- and region-specific reproduction numbers are consistent with cumulative incidence for corresponding groups. CONCLUSIONS: Numerical results reveal that the introduction of heterogeneity into the population to represent the general characteristics of dynamics is essential for the robust estimation of parameters.","Lee, Yunjeong; Lee, Dong Han; Kwon, Hee-Dae; Kim, Changsoo; Lee, Jeehyun",BMC Infect Dis,96,1

Based on SHA 2011, this study analysed the distribution of beneficiary groups of curative care expenditure (CCE) in Xinjiang, to present suggestions for developing health policies. METHODS: A total of 160 health institutions were selected using the multistage stratified random sampling method. An analysis of the agewise CCE distribution, institutional flow, and disease distribution was then performed based on the SHA 2011 accounting framework. RESULTS: In 2016, the CCE in Xinjiang was ¥50.05 billion, accounting for 70.18% of current health expenditure and 6.66% of the gross domestic product. The per capita CCE was ¥2366.56. The CCE was distributed differently across age groups, with the highest spending on people over the age of 65 years. The CCE was highest for diseases of the circulatory, respiratory and digestive systems. Most of the expenditure was incurred in hospitals and, to a lesser extent, in primary healthcare institutions. Family health expenditure, especially on children aged 14 years and below, accounted for a relatively high proportion of the CCE. CONCLUSION: SHA 2011 was used to capture data, which was then analysed according to the newly added beneficiary dimension. The findings revealed that the use of medical resources is low, the scale of primary medical institutions needs to be significantly expanded and there is a need to optimise the CCE financing scheme.

As eosinophils are involved in host defense, regulate immune responses, generate pruritus, induce remodeling and fibrosis, and can cause tissue damage, they have the capacity to actively contribute to the pathogenesis of diseases. Recent research provided deeper insights in the mechanisms, e.g., bacterial and viral clearance, blister formation, recruitment of cytotoxic T cells, and generation of pruritus, by which eosinophils might come into action. This review aims at providing an overview on the clinical presentations of eosinophil-associated dermatoses and the current understanding of their pathogenic role in these diseases.

Moreover, the controllability and automation offered by the microfluidic chips in combination with the unique capabilities of the magnetic nanoparticles and their ability to be remotely controlled and detected, have recently provided tremendous advances in biotechnology. In particular, microfluidic chips with magnetic nanoparticles serve as sensitive, high throughput, and portable devices for contactless detecting and manipulating DNAs, RNAs, living cells, and viruses. In this work, we review recent fundamental advances in the field with a focus on biomedical applications. First, we study novel microfluidic-based methods in synthesizing magnetic nanoparticles as well as microparticles encapsulating them. We review both continues-flow and droplet-based microreactors, including the ones based on the cross-flow, co-flow, and flow-focusing methods. Then, we investigate the microfluidic-based methods for manipulating tiny magnetic particles. These manipulation techniques include the ones based on external magnets, embedded micro-coils, and magnetic thin films. Finally, we review techniques invented for the detection and magnetic measurement of magnetic nanoparticles and magnetically labeled bioparticles. We include the advances in anisotropic magnetoresistive, giant magnetoresistive, tunneling magnetoresistive, and magnetorelaxometry sensors.

Temperature is a major driver for many vector-borne diseases including Bluetongue viral (BTV) disease, a midge-borne febrile disease of ruminants, notably livestock, whose etiology ranges from mild or asymptomatic to rapidly fatal, thus threatening animal agriculture and the economy of affected countries. Using modeling tools, we seek to predict where the transmission can occur based on suitable temperatures for BTV. We fit thermal performance curves to temperature-sensitive midge life-history traits, using a Bayesian approach. We incorporate these curves into S(T), a transmission suitability metric derived from the disease’s basic reproductive number, [Formula: see text] This suitability metric encompasses all components that are known to be temperature-dependent. We use trait responses for two species of key midge vectors, Culicoides sonorensis and Culicoides variipennis present in North America. Our results show that outbreaks of BTV are more likely between 15[Formula: see text] C and [Formula: see text] , with predicted peak transmission risk at 26 [Formula: see text] C. The greatest uncertainty in S(T) is associated with the following: the uncertainty in mortality and fecundity of midges near optimal temperature for transmission; midges’ probability of becoming infectious post-infection at the lower edge of the thermal range; and the biting rate together with vector competence at the higher edge of the thermal range. We compare three model formulations and show that incorporating thermal curves into all three leads to similar BTV risk predictions. To demonstrate the utility of this modeling approach, we created global suitability maps indicating the areas at high and long-term risk of BTV transmission, to assess risk and to anticipate potential locations of disease establishment.

Following the use of J-Cloth impregnated with medium (negative control wipes) or the use of activated hydrogen peroxide (AHP)-, ethanol-, sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl)-, or single or dual quaternary ammonium compound (QAC)-based DPW, virus recovery from the carriers was assayed by titration assay and by two passages on Vero E6 cells in 6-well plates. The Wiperator also enabled the measurement of potential transfer of the virus from the inoculated carrier to a secondary carrier by the DPW or control wipes. The J-Cloth wipes wetted with medium alone (no microbicidal active) removed 1.9–3.5 log(10) of virus from inoculated carriers but transferred ~4 log(10) of the wiped virus to secondary carriers.

In multivariable analyses, sNfL percentile levels were higher in PRLs ≥2 cases (β(add), 16.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.6–28.0; p < 0.01), whereas disease-modifying treatment (DMT), Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score, and T2 lesion load did not affect sNfL. In a similar model, sNfL percentile levels were highest in cases with ≥4 PRLs (n = 30; β(add), 30.4; 95% CI, 15.6–45.2; p < 0.01). Subsequent multivariable analysis revealed that PRLs ≥2 cases also had higher MSSS (β(add), 1.1; 95% CI, 0.3–1.9; p < 0.01), whereas MSSS was not affected by DMT or T2 lesion load. On histopathology, both chronic active and smoldering lesions exhibited more severe acute axonal damage at the lesion edge than in the lesion center (edge vs center: p = 0.004 and p = 0.0002, respectively). CONCLUSION: Chronic white matter inflammation was associated with increased levels of sNfL and disease severity in nonacute MS, suggesting that PRL contribute to clinically relevant, inflammation-driven neurodegeneration.","Maggi, Pietro; Kuhle, Jens; Schädelin, Sabine; van der Meer, Franziska; Weigel, Matthias; Galbusera, Riccardo; Mathias, Amandine; Lu, Po-Jui; Rahmanzadeh, Reza; Benkert, Pascal; La Rosa, Francesco; Bach Cuadra, Meritxell; Sati, Pascal; Théaudin, Marie; Pot, Caroline; van Pesch, Vincent; Leppert, David; Stadelmann, Christine; Kappos, Ludwig; Du Pasquier, Renaud; Reich, Daniel S.; Absinta, Martina; Granziera, Cristina",Neurology,96,1

The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intranasal (IN) ketamine for adult acute pain in the emergency setting. We searched and identified studies up to 21 May 2021 via PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Database, and Google Scholar. The random-effects model with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) was used to estimate mean differences (MDs) and odds ratios (ORs). The I(2) statistic and Cochran’s Q test were used to determine heterogeneity. The protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42020213391). Seven randomised controlled trials were included with a total of 1760 patients. There was no significant difference in pain scores comparing IN ketamine with IV analgesics or placebo at 5 (MD 0.94, p = 0.26), 15 (MD 0.15, p = 0.74), 25 (MD 0.24, p = 0.62), 30 (MD −0.05, p = 0.87), and 60 (MD −0.42, p = 0.53) minutes. There was also no significant difference in the need for rescue analgesics between IN ketamine and IV analgesics (OR 1.66, 95% CI: 0.57−4.86, p = 0.35, I(2) = 70%). Only mild adverse effects were observed in patients who received IN ketamine. Our results suggest that IN ketamine is non-inferior to IV analgesics and may have a role in acute pain management among adults in the ED.","Seak, Yee Sin; Nor, Junainah; Tuan Kamauzaman, Tuan Hairulnizam; Arithra, Ariff; Islam, Md Asiful",J Clin Med,96,1

Equity challenges for the future of cystic fibrosis care - commentary,14.272022,8.202922,2021-09-08,"BACKGROUND: Entamoeba histolytica (E. histolytica) is rarely identified as a cause of amebic pericarditis. We report a case of amebic pericarditis complicated by cardiac tamponade, in which the diagnosis was missed initially and was made retrospectively by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of a stored sample of pericardial fluid. Furthermore, we performed a systematic review of the literature on amebic pericarditis. CASE PRESENTATION: A 71-year-old Japanese man who had a history of sexual intercourse with several commercial sex workers 4 months previously, presented to our hospital with left chest pain and cough. He was admitted on suspicion of pericarditis. On hospital day 7, he developed cardiac tamponade requiring urgent pericardiocentesis. The patient’s symptoms temporarily improved, but 1 month later, he returned with fever and abdominal pain, and multiple liver lesions were found in the right lobe. Polymerase chain reaction of the aspiration fluid of the liver lesion and pericardial and pleural fluid stored from the previous hospitalization were all positive for E. histolytica. Together with the positive serum antibody for E. histolytica, a diagnosis of amebic pericarditis was made. Notably, the diagnosis was missed initially and was made retrospectively by performing PCR testing. The patient improved with metronidazole 750 mg thrice daily for 14 days, followed by paromomycin 500 mg thrice daily for 10 days. CONCLUSIONS: This case suggests that, although only 122 cases of amebic pericarditis have been reported, clinicians should be aware of E. histolytica as a potential causative pathogen. The polymerase chain reaction method was used to detect E. histolytica in the pericardial effusion and was found to be useful for the diagnosis of amebic pericarditis in addition to the positive results for the serum antibody testing for E. histolytica. Because of the high mortality associated with delayed treatment, prompt diagnosis should be made.","Matsuo, Takahiro; Saito, Akira; Kawai, Fujimi; Ishikawa, Kazuhiro; Hasegawa, Ryo; Suzuki, Takahiro; Fujino, Takahisa; Kinoshita, Katsuhito; Asano, Taku; Mizuno, Atsushi; Yagita, Kenji; Komiyama, Nobuyuki; Uehara, Yuki; Mori, Nobuyoshi",BMC Infect Dis,96,12

The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors criteria for authorship (ICMJEc) are intended to prevent abuses of authorship and are used by more than 5500 medical journals. However, the binary ICMJEc have not yet been quantified. AIM: To develop a numeric scoring rubric for the ICMJEc to corroborate the authenticity of authorship claims. METHODS: The four ICMJEc were separated into the nine authorship components of conception, design, data acquisition, data analysis, interpretation of data, draft, revision, final approval and accountability. In spring 2021, members of an international association of medical editors rated the importance of each authorship component using an 11-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (no importance) to 10 (most important). The median component scores were used to calibrate the pairwise comparisons in an analytic hierarchy process (AHP). The AHP priority weights were multiplied against a four-level perceived effort/capability grade to calculate an authorship score. RESULTS: Sixty-six decision-making medical editors completed the survey. The components had the median scores/AHP weights: conception 7.5/5.3%; design 8/8.9%; data acquisition 7/3.6%; data analysis 7/3.6%; interpretation of data 8/8.9%; draft 8/8.9%; revision 8/8.9%; final approval 9/20.1%; and accountability 10/31.8%, with Kruskal–Wallis Chi(2) = 65.11, p < 0.001. CONCLUSION: The editors rated accountability as the most important component of authorship, followed by the final approval of the manuscript; data acquisition had the lowest median importance score for authorship. The scoring rubric (https://tinyurl.com/eyu86y96) transforms the binary tetrad ICMJEc into 9 quantifiable components of authorship, providing a transparent method to objectively assess authorship contributions, determine authorship order and potentially decrease the abuse of authorship. If desired, individual journals can survey their editorial boards and use the AHP method to derive customized weightings for an ICMJEc-based authorship index.","Ing, Edsel B",Adv Med Educ Pract,96,1

Absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) was reported to be associated with immunosuppression and the development of IPN. The aim of this study was to describe the trajectory of ALC during the early phase of AP and assess its association with IPN. METHODS: We retrospectively screened patients with AP admitted to our center between January 2016 and July 2019. The ALC levels for the first 7 days after admission were collected. Group-based trajectory modeling was performed to detect the trajectories. Cox proportional hazards regression model was adopted to identify potential risk factors of IPN. RESULTS: Overall, 292 patients were enrolled for analysis. A triple-group trajectory model was developed, assigning 116 patients to the low-level ALC group, 133 to the medium-level ALC group, and 43 to the high-level ALC group. There was no overall significant difference regarding the incidence of IPN among the 3 groups (P = 0.066). In pairwise comparison, patients in the low-level ALC group had significantly higher incidence of IPN than those in the high-level ALC group (hazard ratio: 3.50; 95% confidence interval: 1.22–10.00, P = 0.020). Length of hospital stay and intensive care unit stay differed significantly among patients with different trajectories (P = 0.042 and 0.033, respectively). DISCUSSION: Despite the fact that the trajectories of ALC is overall insignificant for the development of IPN, patients with persistent low ALC trajectories during the early phase of AP are more likely to develop IPN when compared with patients with high ALC trajectories.","Zhou, Jing; Chen, Wensong; Liu, Yang; Qu, Cheng; Jiang, Wendi; Yin, Jiangtao; Lin, Jiajia; Mao, Wenjian; Ye, Bo; Zhou, Jing; Ke, Lu; Tong, Zhihui; Liu, Yuxiu; Li, Weiqin",Clin Transl Gastroenterol,96,22

This process is mainly mediated through cytokines, which amplify graft immunogenicity. We investigated the immunological response in a brain death liver donor model and analysed the effects of thalidomide, a drug with powerful immunomodulatory properties. Brain death was induced in male Lewis rats. We studied three groups: Control (sham-operated rats in which trepanation was performed without inserting the balloon catheter), BD (rats subjected to brain death by increasing intracranial pressure) and BD + Thalid (BD rats receiving thalidomide after brain death). After 6 h, serum levels of AST, ALT, LDH, and ALP as well as systemic and hepatic levels of TNF-α, IL1-β, IL-6, and IL-10 were analysed. We also determined the mRNA expression of MHC Class I and Class II, NF-κB, and macrophage infiltration. NF-κB was also examined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Thalidomide treatment significantly reduced serum levels of hepatic enzymes and TNF-α, IL-1-β, and IL-6. These cytokines were evaluated at either the mRNA expression or protein level in liver tissue. In addition, thalidomide administration resulted in a significant reduction in macrophages, MHC Class I and Class II, and NF-κB activation. This study reveals that thalidomide significantly inhibited the immunologic response and graft immunogenicity, possibly through suppression of NF-κB activation.","Santana, Alexandre Chagas; Andraus, Wellington; Silva, Filipe Miranda Oliveira; Dellê, Humberto; Pepineli, Rafael; de Moraes, Edvaldo Leal; Scavone, Cristoforo; de Sá Lima, Larissa; Degaspari, Sabrina; Brasil, Sergio; Solla, Davi Jorge Fontoura; Ruiz, Liliane Moreira; de Oliveira-Braga, Karina Andrighetti; Nepomuceno, Natalia Aparecida; Pêgo-Fernandes, Paulo Manuel; Tullius, Stefan Gunther; Figueiredo, Eberval Gadelha",Sci Rep,96,1

This discrepancy was studied in a differentiated manner in order to gear the further development and implementation of VR towards the target group. Methods: From January 2020 to July 2020, medical students (N=318) were asked to watch ten videos online and rate them on the basis of acceptance indicators (e.g., fun and fairness). Using obstetrics as an example, the videos demonstrated five levels of VR technology functionality (e.g., haptic and adaptive feedback), some of which were visionary, in two use scenarios (teaching and the OSCE). The individual and aggregate indicators were compared with non-parametric testing procedures across application scenarios, functional levels and genders. In addition, correlations between the acceptance and the factors of semester, age, computer affinity, and previous VR experience were analyzed. Results: Across all functional levels, VR was more likely to be accepted in the classroom than in the OSCE. Comparisons across functional levels also revealed that the VR ready to be marketed was significantly more accepted than the visionary functions. This skepticism toward advancing VR technology was most pronounced with regard to the vision of autonomous VR examinations and among female students with a low computer affinity. Conclusion: The results suggest that the students’ reservations are due to a lack of experience with the VR technology. In order for young physicians to become familiar with the technology and to be able to use it competently in the everyday clinical practice in the future, VR should not only be used as a teaching tool but also be part of the curriculum. Practical examinations using VR, on the other hand, are only recommended once the technology has become established in teaching and has been proven to be reliable.","Walter, Steffen; Speidel, Robert; Hann, Alexander; Leitner, Janine; Jerg-Bretzke, Lucia; Kropp, Peter; Garbe, Jakob; Ebner, Florian",GMS J Med Educ,96,22

Perspectives for the field at both the basic research and the industrial level are emphasized. Perspectives considered of relevance in terms of basic research include (1) advancing the development of oral formulations, (2) expanding the modalities of expression of immunogens, (3) diversifying production platforms, particularly those performed under full containment, and (4) targeting a broader number of diseases. These goals are expected to multiply the expectations for benefits derived from plant-based vaccine-production technology. On the other hand, technology transfer and regulatory issues represent a critical hurdle to this technology becoming a reality. It is also critical to achieve social acceptance as well as implement initiatives for the exploitation of the technology for humanitarian purposes and for the benefit of poor countries. This overview predicts considerable potential for plant-based vaccines to positively impact the field of vaccinology in the near future.","Govea-Alonso, Dania O.; Rybicki, Edward; Rosales-Mendoza, Sergio",Genetically Engineered Plants as a Source of Vaccines Against Wide Spread Diseases,96,1

Cats vaccinated with TGE virus developed neutralizing antibodies against TGE virus and low titer antibody against FIP virus detected by an indirect fluorescent antibody technique but were not protected against a virulent FIP virus challenge. Baby pigs and pregnant gilts vaccinated with FIP virus did not develop detectable antibodies to TGE virus. Nevertheless, it appeared that vaccination of swine with FIP virus conferred some immunity against TGE virus infection. Seventeen-day-old pigs vaccinated with two doses of FIP virus had a 67% survival rate following a virulent TGE virus challenge, and 75% of the 3-day-old pigs suckling either FIP or TGE-virus-vaccinated gilts survived virulent TGE virus infection in contrast to 0% survival of baby pigs suckling unvaccinated gilts.","Woods, R.D.; Pedersen, N.C.",Vet Microbiol,96,17

CT permits the detection of the main infectious pattern and associated findings with high confidence and allows for the precise assessment of all involved structures, to potentially guide a bronchoalveolar lavage or another diagnostic procedure, and to ensure a reliable follow-up. It may be performed at a carefully chosen dose, which may nearly reach that of a chest X-ray in specific situations. The importance of post-processing tools is undeniable in some conditions, in particular for the evaluation of micronodules in the immunocompromised population. The wide spectrum of features of specific organisms according to the immune status, such as in aspergillosis or tuberculosis, must be known, as well as the potential of atypical presentations in case of Pneumocystis jirovecii (PCP) pneumonia when occurring in non-HIV immunocompromised patients. In all cases, underlying disorders must be considered as well as all the differential diagnoses.

The part of the signal of the NDT which is demographically identifiable, based on the proportion of the immature skeletons in cemeteries, shows that a baby-boom occurred and, beyond that, with the onset of the change in the economic system, a fertility transition towards high values also occurred. What was the biodemographic cause of this fertility explosion, beyond the proxy variable represented by sedentarism? The cause is a major shift in the maternal energetics of farming communities relative to mobile foragers. In the energy balance there was (i) on the intake side, an underlying trend towards a reduction in low-calorie food from hunting and fishing, and a correlative increase in high-calorie food from agriculture, (ii) on the expenditure side, a reduction in the physical energy devoted to mobility and the maternal stress of child transportation. 2. The NDT is detectable from a signal representing a fertility transition, but the transition relating to mortality is missing and must be inferred. If, during the fertility transition, mortality had remained the same as in the preceding forager period, then the population would have grown infinitely. The assumption of unchanged mortality during the entire fertility transition is therefore not realistic. Mortality, in its turn, must have begun to rise well before the end of the fertility transition. But when? Why? One of the answers consists of a model where, except at the start of the process, birth and mortality rates rise more or less simultaneously, bringing about a typical rate of increase for pre-industrial populations of slightly above zero. 3. According to the level and speed of the population growth, what should we expect in terms of population structure? What are the expected effects of this growth, not only on the population in numbers but also on age distribution, the distribution and structure of families, the distribution of households and on family systems?","Bocquet-Appel, Jean-Pierre",The Neolithic Demographic Transition and its Consequences,96,1

Zn and Se are essential trace elements that play a pivotal role in immune functions and antioxidant defense and, consequently, are claimed to play also a role in successful aging trajectories. Consistently with their nature of essential trace elements, a plethora of data obtained “in vitro” and “in vivo” (in humans and animal models) support the relevance of Zn and Se for both the innate and adoptive immune response. Moreover, Zn and Se are strictly involved in the synthesis and regulation of activity of proteins and enzymes, e.g., metallothioneins (MT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPX), that are necessary for our endogenous antioxidant response. This is clearly important to protect our cells from oxidative damage and to slow the decline of our immune system with aging. Age-related changes affecting tissue levels of Zn and Se may indicate that the risk of Zn and Se deficiency increases with aging. However, it is still unclear which of these changes can be the consequence of a “real deficiency” and which can be part of our physiological compensatory response to the accumulating damage occurring in aging. Furthermore, the upregulation of antioxidant proteins (Zn and Se dependent) may be a manifestation of self-induced oxidative stress. By the way, Zn and Se dependent proteins are modulated not only by nutritional status, but also by well-known hallmarks of aging that play antagonistic functions, such as the deregulated nutrient sensing pathways and cellular senescence. Thus, it is not an easy task to conduct Zn or Se supplementation in elderly and it is emerging consistent that these kind of supplementation requires an individualized approach. Anyway, there is consistent support that supplementation with Zn using doses around 10 mg/day is generally safe in elderly and may even improve part of immune performances in those subjects with a baseline deficiency. Regarding Se supplementation, it may induce both beneficial and detrimental effects on cellular immunity depending on the form of Se, supplemental dose, and delivery matrix. The nutritional association of supplements based on “Zn plus Se” is hypothesized to provide additional benefits, but this will likely need a more complex individualized approach. The improvement of our knowledge around screening and detection of Zn and Se deficiency in aging could lead to substantial benefits in terms of efficacy of nutritional supplements aimed at ameliorate performance and health in aging.","Mocchegiani, Eugenio; Malavolta, Marco",Handbook of Immunosenescence,96,12

As a natural phenomenon, scientists tend to concentrate on the beneficial uses of scientific research, but each of them should also concentrate on the potential destructive misuses, in as far as is known, assumed or reasonably predicted. Considering the fast accumulation of sophisticated scientific and biotechnological information, it is upon the scientist and his community to inform and warn the public about the potential destructive misuses of biotechnological research and findings. It is instrumental for the public to be aware of the risks posed by certain dangerous biological agents that are used, manipulated or developed in the course of biotechnological research. The public must be aware of and be reminded that certain biological agents can be used as biological lethal weapons for mass-destruction, or misused for deliberately inflicting infectious diseases. This can be done either by directly spreading common pathogens or by indirectly contaminating food-products, water resources, crops, animal food and feed, etc. It is known that certain lethal biological agents can be transformed into more lethal forms or may even be specifically engineered as such. It is upon the public at large, in applying its collective moral conscience, guided by relevant knowledge and information, to choose what scientific research and advanced technologies should be furthered, banned, or temporarily withheld.

Features of this concept such as its defeasibility make it well suited to reasoning in contexts of uncertainty. However, in order to achieve any purchase in reasoning, presumption must find a logical home. It is argued that that home is as part of a group of arguments known as the informal fallacies.

Given the high complexity many issues have to be taken into account. Simplification is urgently warranted not to loose focus of the important things to be done. METHODS: To look at phase 3 from the endpoint—in this case hospital admission—should facilitate the focus on key variables upstream. Based on a simplified model of approximated and plausible parameters for the overall attack rate (AR), the AR(hospitalization) and the AR(ICU admission), the resources needed are compared with the available resources i.e. number of beds available in general and beds in ICU in particular. The calculations are carried out population-based for Ploen County as well as regionally together with the Kiel metropolitan area. RESULTS: Since the ARs in the up do date available cohorts are overestimated, considerably lower AR(hospitalization) and AR(ICU) should be expected. An AR(hospitalization) of 10% could not be materialized in Ploen County; one with 5% could. In the regional analysis together with the University Hospital Kiel (UKSH) an AR(hospitalization) of up to 10% is feasible, as also an AR(ICU) of 3%. The kinetics of hospital admissions is, however, dependent from countermeasures in public health as well as admission habits of the family physicians. The available number of beds is determined by beds made available and by the mean duration of hospitalization. The latter depends from the age and underlying conditions of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: System failure has to be averted by clarity in regard to the key parameters and their independent variables. The regional management is crucial and should be coordinated by a so-called bed-coordinator. Close cooperation allover the health care system is needed in alliance with the local health departments.","Weigl, Josef",,96,1

The combination of these two determines the population trend called fitness. Species interact by competition for resources (predation or symbiosis); individuals of the same species influence one another socially, and the individuals themselves may be composed of large numbers of specialized cells, all containing the same genetic information, that have to cooperate with one another for the organism they compose to survive and reproduce. Evolution is a dynamic self-organization process in which causal correlations between the performance of the process as a whole and its component subprocesses are not identifiable. In Darwinian evolution, selection is complemented by mutation. Mutation can be studied quantitatively if selection is excluded by restricting amplification to a single replication round. Mutation rates can be measured and is defined as the probability of incorporating a noncognate base per incorporation event. Many quantitative insights into the nature of evolution have been gained from studying the model system provided by Qβ replicase. For quantitative studies of natural selection under controlled conditions, amplification of RNA by Qβ replicase is still unsurpassed.","Biebricher, Christof K.",Origin and Evolution of Viruses,96,1

Most cases of DAH are caused by capillaritis associated with systemic autoimmune diseases. In BAL specimen, there are red blood cells as well as hemosiderin-laden macrophages—it is essential to differentiate DAH from artificial bleeding induced by bronchoscopy or biopsy, as well as from aspiration from the upper respiratory tract. DAH may also occur as an idiopathic condition. It should be distinguished from focal pulmonary hemorrhage secondary to infections, arteriovenous malformation or pulmonary embolism. Early bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage is usually the first approach to exclude infections.

Initial witness validators used model checkers that were amended to benefit from guidance information provided by the witness. This approach comes with substantial overhead. Second-generation execution-based validators traded speed for reduced strength in case of incomplete and non-exact witnesses. This was done by extracting test harnesses and compiling them with the original program. We present the nitwit tool, a new interpretation-based violation witness validator for C programs that is trimmed to be fast and memory efficient. It verifies a record number of witnesses of SV-COMP’20 in the ReachSafety category. Our novel tool exchanges initial compilation overhead and optimized execution for rapid startup performance. nitwit borrows C semantics from the compiler used for compilation.

However, there has been a turnaround in its growth performance and has now come to occupy a high rank in terms of per capita income among Indian States. This has been largely through a high growth performance facilitated by significant remittances from abroad. However, there have not been consistent time-series data on annual remittances. This paper is an attempt to fulfil this gap by estimating foreign remittances to Kerala for a period of 47 years that is close to half a century. Using these data, the paper has presented a Modified State Income for Kerala and calculated its impact on consumption and savings. The significance of the sizeable emigration to the labour market situation has also been highlighted. Given the fact that remittances come as household income confined to a small segment of the total households, the impact of annual remittances on income and consumption inequality has also been highlighted. The results show an increasing trend in inequality. Despite a high growth performance aided by remittances, Kerala has not been able to address its longstanding problem of educated unemployment, especially for its women. In this context, the state’s inability to take advantage of the enhanced per capita income to maintain its tax–income ratio, let alone enhance it, assumes great significance as an area of concern.","Kannan, K.

By noting the positive aspects of parasocial interaction and implementing them, individuals can improve their well-being. For instance, while parasocial interaction should not replace real relationships, the behavior can supplement them in filling social needs and decreasing loneliness. Such interaction is helpful for individuals when socialization is not attractive or possible due to a variety of causes. While this type of supplementation has typically been studied in the context of internal shortcomings, it likely also occurs when social deficits are invoked externally, such as through long-term work in remote areas. With the explosion of digital media in the last 25 years, opportunities to augment the fulfillment provided by real relationships with parasocialization have never been so great. Moreover, the recent COVID-19 quarantine greatly restricted real socialization. Those who live alone had e-mail and video calls to sustain them, but virtually no physical contact if they abided quarantine rules. During this time, people appear to have relied on social media and binge-watching streamed series to give themselves a feeling of connection with others more than ever before. The effect of such social surrogacy during the quarantine is only one of many parasocial interaction topics that emerge in the wake of the first wave. This paper will review the relevant digital era literature on parasocial interaction and suggest several areas of exploration into the phenomenon contributed uniquely by the quarantine.","Jarzyna, Carol Laurent",Hu Arenas,96,12

While empirical research on deliberative democracy tends to focus on the role of mini-publics in giving low-income households the opportunity in small-scale, carefully designed forums to characterise, justify, and reflect on their views, such conception of deliberative agency gets lost in the picture once deliberative theory begins thinking in systemic terms. This article proposes a remedy to this theoretical and analytical gap by characterising the hypermediated character of the deliberative system and identifying possibilities for communities experiencing poverty to maximise the affordances of digital media for them to make an appearance in the public sphere, speak in their own voice, and carry the embodied and storied character of their arguments. I present two illustrative cases drawing on the experiences of families with low income directly affected by the bloody war on drugs in the Philippines who utilise photojournalism and online music streaming to break in the public sphere and engage in systemic deliberations about the drug war. These examples demonstrate how communities experiencing poverty express their deliberative agency amidst fear, trauma and deprivation and democratise a media-saturated deliberative system under an increasingly authoritarian regime. Overall, this article hopes to strengthen the link between normative media studies and democratic theory and offering possibilities for reforming the public sphere that recognises the poor’s deliberative agency.","Curato, Nicole",Theory Soc,96,1

This unprecedented, previously unplanned redeployment occurred in a rapidly changing environment. This paper describes the process of redeployment at a teaching hospital and assessment of this by the redeployed doctors and redeployment team. OBJECTIVE: Identify key lessons from the redeployment process to inform resilience and future planning for further COVID-19 peaks. METHODS: Redeployment team experiences and challenges were documented in real time and formal structured feedback obtained. All redeployed doctors were asked for quantitative and qualitative feedback regarding their experiences in two distinct acute areas with different approaches to staffing. RESULTS: 63 redeployed staff and five members of the redeployment team completed feedback questionnaires. Most redeployed doctors (76%) were satisfied and had adequate support and training. Redeployment was associated with self-reported stress and anxiety in 95% with 59% describing this as moderate or greater. This was reduced by adequate communication, supervision and a sense of belonging to a firm with access to simple information making a significant difference. Awareness of and satisfaction with well-being support services was also high (71%). The redeployment team identified having a well-mixed team who met daily, an online portal and engagement with leads as the key factors for being successful. CONCLUSION: Redeployment in response to COVID-19 was associated with reported stress and anxiety in most redeployed doctors. Communication, local induction and feeling valued and being part of a team helped reduce this.","Sykes, Anny; Pandit, Meghana",,96,24

Therefore, it is significant to discover the efficient agents and components to treat HF, thus restraining the further progression of hepatopathy. Astragalus membranaceus (Fisch.) Bunge [also called Astragali Radix (AR)] is a famous herb in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), which possesses a variety of biological activities and exerts good therapeutic effects in the treatment of HF. Flavonoids account for the major active ingredients related to the AR pharmacological effects. Total AR flavonoids have been proved to exert inhibitory effects on hepatic fibrosis. This study aimed to further undertake network pharmacology analysis coupled with experimental validation and molecular docking to investigate the effects and mechanism of multiple flavonoid components from AR against liver fibrosis. The results of the network pharmacology analysis showed that the flavonoids from AR exerted their pharmacological effects against liver fibrosis by modulating multiple targets and pathways. The experimental validation data showed that the flavonoids from AR were able to suppress transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1)-mediated activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and reduce extracellular matrix deposition in HSC-T6 cells via regulating the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signal transduction pathway. The results of the molecular docking study further showed that the flavonoids had a strong binding affinity for IκB kinase (IKKβ) after docking into the crystal structure. The above results indicated that, flavonoids possibly exerted the anti-inflammatory effect on treating HF by mediating inflammatory signaling pathways. The potential mechanism of these flavonoids against liver fibrosis may be related to suppression of the NF-κB pathway through effective inhibition of IKKβ. This study not only provides a scientific basis for clarifying the effects and mechanism of AR flavonoids against liver fibrosis but also suggests a novel promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of liver fibrosis.","An, Lin; Lin, Yuefang; Li, Leyan; Kong, Muyan; Lou, Yanmei; Wu, Jinjun; Liu, Zhongqiu",Front Pharmacol,96,1

The viral fusion glycoprotein (RSV F) plays an essential role in the infection process, and it is a primary target of neutralizing antibodies, making it an attractive site for vaccine development. With this in view, there is a persistent need to identify selective antiviral drugs against RSV, targeting the major antigenic sites on the F protein. We aimed to conduct a robust in silico high-throughput drug screening of one million compounds to explore potential inhibitors that bind the major antigenic site Ø and site II on RSV F protein, which are the main target of neutralizing antibodies (NAb). We utilized the three-dimensional crystallographic structure of both antigenic site Ø on pre-F and antigenic II on post-F to screen for potential anti-RSV inhibitors. A library of one million small compounds was docked to explore lead binders in the major antigenic sites by using virtual lab bench CLC Drug Discovery. We also performed Quantitative Structure-Activity and Relationship (QSAR) for the lead best binders known for their antiviral activity. Among one million tested ligands, seven ligands (PubChem ID: 3714418, 24787350, 49828911, 24802036, 79824892, 49726463, and 3139884) were identified as the best binders to neutralizing epitopes site Ø and four ligands (PubChem ID: 865999, 17505357, 24802036, and 24285058) to neutralizing epitopes site II, respectively. These binders exhibited significant interactions with neutralizing epitopes on RSV F, with an average of six H bonds, docking energy of − 15.43 Kcal·mol(−1), and minimum interaction energy of − 7.45 Kcal·mol(−1). Using in silico virtual screening, we identified potential RSV inhibitors that bind two major antigenic sites on the RSV F protein. Using structure-based design and combination-based drug therapy, identified molecules could be modified to generate the next generation anti-RSV drugs.

Results showed that during COVID-19, students generally held positive attitudes towards online WCF and teachers offered more tutorials and feedback that could be reviewed indefinitely, which created a comfortable learning space for students. Findings demonstrate that students used fewer social behaviour strategies than other strategies and the effectiveness of peer interaction was limited by peers’ relatively low writing proficiency, tendency to give compliments, and the inconveniences of online communication. Students’ feedback-seeking orientation was found to be positively associated with SRL writing strategies; the online interactions between teachers and students in relation to teachers’ feedback motivated students to engage more in their subsequent writing practices.

We built a web-based machine learning application that incorporated clinical measurements to predict the postoperative ICL vault and select the optimal ICL size. METHODS: We applied the stacking ensemble technique based on eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and a light gradient boosting machine to pre-operative ocular data from two eye centers to predict the postoperative vault. We assigned the Korean patient data to a training (N = 2756 eyes) and internal validation (N = 693 eyes) datasets (prospective validation). Japanese patient data (N = 290 eyes) were used as an independent external dataset from different centers to validate the model. RESULTS: We developed an ensemble model that showed statistically better performance with a lower mean absolute error for ICL vault prediction (106.88 µm and 143.69 µm in the internal and external validation, respectively) than the other machine learning techniques and the classic ICL sizing methods did when applied to both validation datasets. Considering the lens size selection accuracy, our proposed method showed the best performance for both reference datasets (75.9% and 67.4% in the internal and external validation, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Applying the ensemble approach to a large dataset of patients who underwent ICL implantation resulted in a more accurate prediction of vault size and selection of the optimal ICL size.

METHOD: We performed a retrospective analysis of all patients who underwent cardiac surgery at our institution since March 2020 post intervention (new COVID-19 peri-operative guidelines). A retrospective analysis of all patients who underwent cardiac surgery in the 12 months preceding the lockdown was also performed as a baseline cohort group. RESULTS: A total of 2,600 patients (493 during the COVID-19 pandemic) were included in this study. Urgent/emergency procedures accounted for more than 60% of procedures performed during the lockdown compared to 39% previously. 67 (2.6%) surgical wound infections occurred in the study population. During the COVID pandemic, there were 4 SWIs with an overall incidence rate of 0.8%. Patients who underwent cardiac surgery during the COVID pandemic had a lower than expected rate of surgical wound infections (P = 0.006). Other significant predictors of surgical wound infections included a diagnosis of diabetes and being a smoker. CONCLUSIONS: This report suggests that a significant proportion of SWI’s are iatrogenic related and can be avoided through a rigorous attention to detail in the peri-operative setting.","Ike, I D; Durand-Hill, M; Hussain, A",Br J Surg,96,1

Differentiating between local food systems and short supply chains, a review of the literature on the environmental, social and economic dimensions of sustainability is carried out. “Local food” cannot simply be equated with “sustainable food”; in most cases, it neither can ensure food security nor does it necessarily have a lower carbon footprint. For the environmental sustainability of food systems, many more factors matter than just transportation, not least consumers’ dietary choices. In terms of social sustainability, local food systems are not necessarily more resilient, but they can contribute to rural development and a sense of community. In terms of economic sustainability, selling via short supply chains into local markets can benefit certain farmers, while for other producers it can be more profitable to supply international markets.","Stein, Alexander J.; Santini, Fabien",Rev Agric Food Environ Stud,96,0

The young population of Bangladesh is rapidly embracing social media through the internet and afflicted with the malaise of countering violent extremism (CVE), often through Facebook. Given the increasing connectedness that the internet and social media offer, it is crucial that the fight against CVE shift to the digital space. Extremists are increasingly adopting novel ways and means based on technology to draw unsuspecting youth to their cause. It is essential to establish effective implementable strategies to stop the CVE activities using social media in Bangladesh. This study aims to identify existing initiatives globally in the space of disruptive online technologies that have yielded some success in preventing CVE. Various publications such as journal and news articles, TV news, and blogs have been used as data sources for this study. Also, fifteen expert interviews have been conducted to identify the most effective strategies for CVE in Bangladesh. Through the content analysis, the study highlights successful efforts and explores technology-based initiatives that can be deployed in Bangladesh to minimize the impact of VE activities through online technology. Finally, recommendations for strategies to restrict VE activities through technologies have been suggested that can be potentially implemented by the Bangladesh government by coordinating with international donor agencies and CVE practitioners. The research output recommends that Bangladesh and other less developed countries can concurrently deal with CVE by successfully using cutting-edge online/digital technologies.","Amit, Sajid; Barua, Lumbini; Kafy, Abdulla - Al",Heliyon,96,13

Reduced bioavailability, elevated toxicity, increased side effects, and resistance of multiple first-line and second-line TB medications, including isoniazid, ethionamide necessitate studies of new drugs. The method of computational biology and bioinformatics approach allows virtual screening of a large number of drugs, reduces growing side effects of medications, and predicts potential drug resistance over time. In this study, we have analyzed fifty small molecules with antituberculosis properties using in silico approach including molecular docking, drug-likeness assessment, ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, toxicity) profile evaluation, P450 site of metabolism prediction, and molecular dynamics simulation. Among those fifty compounds, 3-[3-(4-Fluorophenyl)-1,2,4-oxadiazol-5-yl]-N-(2-methylphenyl) piperidine-1-carboxamide (C22) and 5-(4-Ethyl-phenyl)-2-(1H-tetrazol-5-ylmethyl)-2H-tetrazole (C29) were found to pass the two-step molecular docking, P450 site of metabolism prediction and pharmacokinetics analysis successfully. Their binding stability for target proteins has been evaluated through root mean square deviation and root mean square fluctuation, Radius of gyration analysis from 10 ns Molecular Dynamics Simulation (MDS). Our identified drugs (C22 and C29) performed better than the control drugs (Isoniazid, Ethionamide) regarding binding affinity and molecular stability with the regulatory proteins (InhA, EthR) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The study proposed these compounds as effective therapeutic agents for Tuberculosis drug discovery, but further in vitro and in vivo testing are needed to substantiate their potential as novel drugs and modes of action.","Halder, Sajal Kumar; Elma, Fatiha",J Clin Tuberc Other Mycobact Dis,96,16

METHODS: Undergraduate students (n = 12) from two universities participate in a yearlong CPDM. In the first semester, undergraduates attend weekly meetings focused on online learning platforms; building community of practice; reviewing learning models, theories, and pedagogy; and building skills to support social and emotional learning. Undergraduates participate in reflective practice throughout the CPDM to advance their teaching skills. In the second semester, undergraduates develop online modules supporting remote instruction for the learner-centered curriculum Teens CAN: Comprehensive Food Literacy in Cooking, Agriculture, and Nutrition. Undergraduates develop virtual lesson procedures and content to be pilot tested with the community of practice. RESULTS: Upon project conclusion, undergraduates will complete a retrospective questionnaire measuring self-efficacy to teach nutrition. They will also participate in an in-depth interview that mirrors the reflective practice, where they reflect on what they gained and wished to change for future CPDM projects. CONCLUSIONS: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, utilizing strategies from in-person CPDMs in virtual professional development may provide an efficient, effective, and equitable methodology to connect with undergraduate students and improve their self-efficacy to teach while providing training and skills. This virtual methodology may serve two purposes; decreasing attrition in participation by removing barriers such as travel and scheduling, but also enhancing the delivery of nutrition education through utilization of modern technology. Limitations of remote instruction are numerous, but providing opportunities for undergraduates to develop skills in online education has the potential to broaden the reach of health-focused programming delivered by agencies with limited staff during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.

Time-restricted feeding (TRF), a type of intermittent fasting, may confer health benefits, including reductions in body weight. Currently, it is unknown if TRF might impact diet quality. The objective of this randomized controlled study was to assess the feasibility of a TRF protocol versus a control (CON) protocol for eight weeks on dietary patterns, anthropometric measures, and cardiometabolic indices in college students. We hypothesized that dietary patterns, anthropometric measures, and cardiometabolic indices would improve for participants in the TRF group. METHODS: Healthy college students were randomly assigned to a TRF intervention group (six-hour daily eating window) or a CON (16-hour daily eating window) for eight weeks. One ‘cheat’ day was permitted each week, and outcomes were measured at weeks zero, four, and eight. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, data collection at week eight was incomplete and these data were not viable; hence, only change data at week four are reported. The Rapid Eating Assessment for Participants [shortened version] questionnaire was used to assess shifts in dietary patterns. RESULTS: Of the 25 initial participants, 17 completed the study (TRF group; n = 7; CON group; n = 10; age, 23 ± 4 years; BMI, 23.2 ± 2.3 kg/m(2)). Six TRF participants withdrew from the trial (43%) due to study-related side effects, including excess hunger and poor energy; additionally, in each group, a single participant was lost to follow-up. Change in body weight at week four was significantly different between the TRF group (−1.1 ± 1.6 kg) and the CON group (0.7 ± 1.3 kg); (P = 0.016). There were no between-group differences for change in dietary patterns and cardiometabolic indices (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Although dietary patterns and cardiometabolic indices were not altered between groups over the course of the trial, body weight was reduced in the TRF participants compared to the CON participants. These preliminary data suggest that an 18-hour TRF protocol may be useful for weight reduction; however, this protocol is difficult to follow. Future studies should identify modifications to make TRF more acceptable to users and focus on diet quality.

To counter rapid population ageing and ameliorate a series of problems, China has adjusted its fertility policies several times. On January 1, 2016, the universal two-child policy was implemented. This study analysed the impacts of the adjustment to the fertility policy and potential improvements in fertility intention on the insured population and medical insurance fund sustainability. METHODS: We used an actuarial science method and took the urban and rural residents’ basic medical insurance (URRBMI) of China, which covers most urban and rural residents, as an example to build a dynamic forecast model of population growth and a dynamic actuarial model of medical insurance funds. RESULTS: Compared with the original policy, under the current fertility intention (40%) with the universal two-child policy, the ageing of the population structure of URRBMI participants will decline significantly after 2026, and individuals aged 65 and over will account for only 19.01% of the total participants in 2050. The occurrence of the current deficit and accumulated deficit of the URRBMI fund will be postponed for one year to 2022 and 2028, respectively. If fertility intentions continue to rise, the ageing degree of the population structure will decrease, and the deficit would be further delayed. CONCLUSIONS: The universal two-child policy is conducive to improving the degree of overall population ageing, delaying the occurrence of a URRBMI fund deficit, and improving the sustainability of URRBMI funds. If fertility intention increases, the effects would be stronger. However, since the adjustment of the universal two-child policy has a certain time lag, it will take time to demonstrate this impact. Therefore, while actively promoting the universal two-child policy, other measures should be taken, such as improving the fertility desire among couples of childbearing age and reforming medical insurance payment methods.","Zhang, Xinjie; Huang, Jingru; Luo, Ying",BMC Public Health,96,18

These responses may increase the risk of infection, cause postoperative pain, and exert damaging effects on various body organs. OBJECTIVES: Anesthesia methods may affect cytokine production after surgery. This study aimed to compare the serum levels of cytokines in general and spinal anesthesia among women undergoing cesarean section. METHODS: Thirty parturients (ASA class I and II) undergoing cesarean section were randomly assigned into two equal groups of spinal anesthesia and general anesthesia. Blood samples were taken for measuring the levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-10 (IL-10), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) before induction of anesthesia and 30 minutes after entering the recovery room. RESULTS: In the general anesthesia group, the postoperative serum levels of IL-6 and TNF-α were significantly higher than the corresponding preoperative levels. Significant differences were found between the two groups in the preoperative and postoperative levels of TNF-α. Changes in the IL-6 and TNF-α concentrations were significantly higher in the general anesthesia group as compared to the spinal anesthesia group. However, there was no significant difference in the IL-6:IL-10 and TNF-α: IL-10 ratios between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: General anesthesia, as compared to spinal anesthesia, significantly increased the IL-6 and TNF-α levels after cesarean section. Therefore, the spinal anesthesia technique may be a better option for patients undergoing cesarean section.","Vosoughian, Maryam; Dahi, Mastaneh; Dabir, Shideh; Moshari, Mohammadreza; Tabashi, Soodeh; Mosavi, Zahra",Anesth Pain Med,96,1

The problems have arisen due to the direct effect of COVID 19 infection and treatment or as repercussions of administrative efforts being undertaken to check the rapid spread of the epidemic. The management of some of the diseases has been hampered with the implementation of the policies like lockdown and transportation difficulties. This paper presents a series of four patients (6 eyes with vision loss) of an otherwise benign entity, Allergic Fungal Rhinosinusitis (AFRS), causing visual deterioration, managed amid the pandemic. AFRS has been known to cause vision loss by pressure over the optic nerve or its blood supply; however, a timely surgical intervention in the form of functional endoscopic sinus surgery to remove the disease and decompress the optic nerve, results in favourable outcomes in most patients. A delay in diagnosis and treatment may result in irreparable damage with the resulting inability to salvage the vision. In our series, we observed that vision recovery could be achieved in 66.7% of the affected eyes (four out of six eyes), while a poor visual outcome was observed in two (33%). The poor visual outcome was observed for the eyes with a prolonged visual impairment (4–6 months) at the time of presentation. We would appeal to the physicians to be cognizant of the adverse outcomes associated with the delayed surgical intervention of AFRS in the current pandemic scenario.","Singh, Anup; Kumar, Rajeev; Kanodia, Anupam; Sagar, Prem; Verma, Hitesh; Kumar, Rakesh",Indian J Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,96,1

The IL betainium bis((trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl)imide, [Hbet][NTf2 ], is especially suited for this process due to its redox-stability and specific-functionalization. The potentiostatic electrodeposition of zinc and lead starting directly from ZnO and PbO, which dissolve in [Hbet][NTf2 ] in high concentrations is reported. The initial reduction potentials of zinc(II) and lead(II) are about -1.5 and -1.0 V, respectively.

The IL proves to be stable under the chosen conditions. From IL-solutions, where ZnO, PbO, and MgO have been dissolved, metallic Zn and Pb are deposited under potentiostatic control either consecutively by step-electrodeposition or together in a co-electrodeposition. Using the method, Zn is also deposited on 3D copper foam and assembles into high-voltage zinc-graphite battery.

This study aimed to evaluate the antiproliferative potential of Andean Berry Juice (ABJ) in combination with Aspirin in human SW480 colon adenocarcinoma cells. ABJ primarily contained 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic and chlorogenic acids. The combined treatment of ABJ (IC50 : 30.0 ± 0.11%) and Aspirin (IC50 : 20.0 ± 0.57) exhibited a higher (p < .01) antiproliferative effect than each counterpart. Moreover the same mixture displayed a lower reduced glutathione/oxidized glutathione ratio (GSH/GSSG) than the untreated cells. ABJ-Aspirin combination induced late apoptosis stage without stimulating mitochondrial depolarization and prompted phosphatidylserine relocalization. These results emphasize the antiproliferative potential of bioactive compounds from ABJ and Aspirin combinations. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Natural products such as Andean Berry (V. meridionale Sw.) juice (ABJ) contains antioxidant polyphenols that could reduce the need to use non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, currently employed in cancer treatment, to prevent its side effects. The high abundance of polyphenols from this underutilized berry could stimulate the standardization of its production and industrial exploitation to be transformed into suitable food products delivering natural bioactive compounds with potential anti-cancer effects in vitro.","Arango-Varela, Sandra S; Luzardo-Ocampo, Ivan; Reyes-Dieck, Camilo; Yahia, Elhadi M; Maldonado-Celis, Maria E",Journal of food biochemistry,96,31

Recently, the presence of lead fragments in wild game meat, presumably from the bullets or shot used for hunting, has raised concerns about health risks from meat consumption. OBJECTIVE This study examined the association between blood lead levels (PbB) and wild game consumption. METHODS We recruited 742 participants, aged 2-92 years, from six North Dakota cities. Blood lead samples were collected from 736 persons. Information on socio-demographic background, housing, lead exposure source, and types of wild game consumption (i.e., venison, other game such as moose, birds) was also collected. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) were used to determine the association between PbB and wild game consumption. RESULTS Most participants reported consuming wild game (80.8%) obtained from hunting (98.8%). The geometric mean PbB were 1.27 and 0.84 microg/dl among persons who did and did not consume wild game, respectively. After adjusting for potential confounders, persons who consumed wild game had 0.30 microg/dl (95% confidence interval: 0.16-0.44 microg/dl) higher PbB than persons who did not. For all game types, recent (<1 month) wild game consumption was associated with higher PbB. PbB was also higher among those who consumed a larger serving size (> or = 2 oz vs. <2 oz); however, this association was significant for 'other game' consumption only. CONCLUSIONS Participants who consumed wild game had higher PbB than those who did not consume wild game. Careful review of butchering practices and monitoring of meat-packing processes may decrease lead exposure from wild game consumption.","Iqbal, Shahed; Blumenthal, Wendy; Kennedy, Chinaro; Yip, Fuyuen Y; Pickard, Stephen; Flanders, W Dana; Loringer, Kelly; Kruger, Kirby; Caldwell, Kathleen L; Jean Brown, Mary",Environmental research,96,1

Signaling by Gq-protein-coupled receptors triggers PLC-mediated hydrolysis of PIP2 into inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol, which are well known to modulate vascular ion channel activity. Often overlooked, however, is the role PIP2 itself plays in this regulation. Although numerous reports have demonstrated that PIP2 is critical for ion channel regulation, how it impacts vascular function has received scant attention. In this review, we focus on PIP2 as a regulator of ion channels in smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells-the two major classes of vascular cells. We further address the concerted effects of such regulation on vascular function and blood flow control. We close with a consideration of current knowledge regarding disruption of PIP2 regulation of vascular ion channels in disease.","Harraz, Osama F; Hill-Eubanks, David; Nelson, Mark T",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,96,20

Nevertheless, in standard frozen stallion insemination doses production, SP is completely removed and is replaced by a semen extender. In the present study, we analyzed the effects of the selected seminal plasma protein groups that might play an important role in reducing the detrimental effects on spermatozoa during the cryopreservation process. SP proteins were separated according to their ability to bind to heparin into heparin-binding (Hep+) and heparin-non-binding (Hep-) fractions. The addition of three concentrations-125, 250, and 500 µg/mL-of each protein fraction was tested. After thawing, the following parameters were assessed: sperm motility (by CASA), plasma membrane integrity (PI staining), and acrosomal membrane integrity (PNA staining) using flow cytometry, and capacitation status (anti-phosphotyrosine antibody) using imaging-based flow cytometry. Our results showed that SP protein fractions had a significant effect on the kinematic parameters of spermatozoa and on a proportion of their subpopulations. The 125 µg/mL of Hep+ protein fraction resulted in increased linearity (LIN) and straightness (STR), moreover, with the highest values of sperm velocities (VAP, VSL), also this group contained the highest proportion of the fast sperm subpopulation. In contrast, the highest percentage of slow subpopulation was in the groups with 500 µg/mL of Hep+ fraction and 250 µg/mL of Hep- fraction. Interestingly, acrosomal membrane integrity was also highest in the groups with Hep+ fraction in concentrations of 125 µg/mL. Our results showed that the addition of protein fractions did not significantly affect the plasma membrane integrity and capacitation status of stallion spermatozoa. Moreover, our results confirmed that the effect of SP proteins on the sperm functionality is concentration-dependent, as has been reported for other species. Our study significantly contributes to the lack of studies dealing with possible use of specific stallion SP fractions in the complex puzzle of the improvement of cryopreservation protocols. It is clear that improvement in this field still needs more outputs from future studies, which should be focused on the effect of individual SP proteins on other sperm functional parameters with further implication on the success of artificial insemination in in vivo conditions.","Bubenickova, Filipa; Postlerova, Pavla; Simonik, Ondrej; Sirohi, Jitka; Sichtar, Jiri",International journal of molecular sciences,96,1

Thus, traditional health systems have been transformed into new data-rich environments. This provides an unprecedented opportunity to develop new analytical methods and tools towards a new paradigm of smart and interconnected health systems. Nevertheless, there are risks pertinent to increasing levels of system connectivity and data accessibility. Cyber-attacks become more prevalent and complex, leading to greater likelihood of data breaches. These events bring sudden disruptions to routine operations and cause the loss of billions of dollars. Adversaries often attempt to leverage models to learn a targets sensitive attributes or extrapolate its inclusion within a database. As healthcare systems are critical to improving the wellbeing of our society, there is an urgent need to protect the privacy of patients and minimize the risk of model inversion attacks. This paper presents a new approach, named Mosaic Gradient Perturbation (MGP), to preserve privacy in the framework of predictive modeling, which meets the requirement of differential privacy while mitigating the risk of model inversion. MGP is flexible in fine-tuning the trade-offs between model performance and attack accuracy while being highly scalable for large-scale computing. Experimental results show that the proposed MGP method improves upon traditional gradient perturbation to mitigate the risk of model inversion while offering greater preservation of model accuracy. The MGP technique shows strong potential to circumvent paramount costs due to privacy breaches while maintaining the quality of existing decision-support systems, thereby ushering in a privacy-preserving smart health system.","Krall, Alexander; Finke, Daniel; Yang, Hui",IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics,96,28

Previous experimental studies mainly focussed on evaluating osteomyelitis in the presence of an implant or used a sclerosing agent to promote infection onset. In contrast, we focused on the longitudinal assessment of a nonimplant related osteomyelitis. METHODS An intramedullary tibial infection with S. aureus was established in NZW rabbits. Clinical and haematological infection status was evaluated weekly, combined with X-ray radiographs, biweekly injections of calcium binding fluorophores, and postmortem micro-CT. The development of the infection was assessed by micro-PET at consecutive time points using 18F-FDG as an infection tracer. RESULTS The intramedullary contamination of the rabbit tibia resulted in an osteomyelitis. Haematological parameters confirmed infection in mainly the first postoperative weeks (CRP at the first 5 postoperative weeks, leucocyte differentiation at the second and sixth postoperative weeks, and ESR on the second postoperative week only), while micro-PET was able to detect the infection from the first post-operative week onward until the end of the study. CONCLUSIONS This study shows that osteomyelitis in the rabbit can be induced without use of an implant or sclerosing agent. The sequential follow-up indicates that the diagnostic value of each infection parameter is time point dependant. Furthermore, from all parameters used, the diagnostic value of 18F-FDG micro-PET is the most versatile to assess the presence of an orthopaedic infection in this model.","Odekerken, Jim C E; Walenkamp, Geert H I M; Brans, Boudewijn T; Welting, Tim J M; Arts, Jacobus J C",BioMed research international,96,1

Among 10 bats with complete RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), spike (S), and nucleocapsid (N) genes sequenced, three and two sequence clades for all three genes were codetected in two and five bats, respectively, suggesting the coexistence of two or three distinct genotypes of Ro-BatCoV HKU9 in the same bat. Complete genome sequencing of the distinct genotypes from two bats, using degenerate/genome-specific primers with overlapping sequences confirmed by specific PCR, supported the coexistence of at least two distinct genomes in each bat. Recombination analysis using eight Ro-BatCoV HKU9 genomes showed possible recombination events between strains from different bat individuals, which may have allowed for the generation of different genotypes. Western blot assays using recombinant N proteins of Ro-BatCoV HKU9, Betacoronavirus subgroup A (HCoV-HKU1), subgroup B (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV), and subgroup C (Ty-BatCoV HKU4 and Pi-BatCoV HKU5) coronaviruses were subgroup specific, supporting their classification as separate subgroups under Betacoronavirus. Antibodies were detected in 75 (43%) of 175 and 224 (64%) of 350 tested serum samples from Leschenault's rousette bats by Ro-BatCoV HKU9 N-protein-based Western blot and enzyme immunoassays, respectively. This is the first report describing coinfection of different coronavirus genotypes in bats and coronavirus genotypes of diverse nucleotide variation in the same host. Such unique phenomena, and the unusual instability of ORF7a, are likely due to recombination which may have been facilitated by the dense roosting behavior and long foraging range of Leschenault's rousette.","Lau, Susanna K P; Poon, Rosana W S; Wong, Beatrice H L; Wang, Ming; Huang, Yi; Xu, Huifang; Guo, Rongtong; Li, Kenneth S M; Gao, Kai; Chan, Kwok-Hung; Zheng, Bo-Jian; Woo, Patrick C Y; Yuen, Kwok-Yung",Journal of virology,96,1

Ellagic acid (EA) and Annona muricata (AM) exert antitumor activity against different human tumours. An observational prospective study on the prophylactic effect of oral administration of EA+AM in patients avoiding maintenance regimen is presented. MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients affected by NMIBC and not undergoing maintenance after a 6-week course of intravesical prophylaxis with MMC or BCG were entered. Tis and very high-risk tumours were excluded. After informed consent, the patients were subdivided in relation to the oral assumption or not of EA (100 mg) plus AM (100 mg), daily for 6 months. All patients were submitted to 3-month cytology and cystoscopy. RESULTS 162 (90%) of 180 entered patients are evaluable, 90 and 72 receiving or not EA+AM. No difference emerged in patients' characteristics between the two groups. BCG was given in 86 (54%) and chemotherapy in 74 (46%) patients.

In the web-2 era much of this misinformation is disseminated via social media where information could spread easily and quickly. Monitoring social media content provides crucial insights for health managers to manage the crisis. OBJECTIVE Objective: Given the misinformation surrounding COVID-19 outbreak, this study was aimed to analyze contents of the most commonly used social networks in Iran that is among the affected countries. METHODS Methods: A social media monitoring conducted through a qualitative design to analyze the discussions of social media users about the content related to COVID-19 transferred via Iranian medical faculty members` groups in Telegram and Whats App during Feb 20 to March 20, 2020 emphasizing the misinformation. Discourse analysis was applied and the written dialogues and discussions regarding misinformation about different aspects of the outbreak between medical faculty members all over the country were analyzed. RESULTS Results: Cultural factors, demand pressure for information during the crisis, the easiness of information dissemination via social networks, marketing incentives and the poor legal supervision of online contents are the main reasons of misinformation dissemination. Disease statistics; treatments, vaccines and medicines; prevention and protection methods; dietary recommendations and disease transmission ways are the main subjective categories of releasing misinformation regarding novel coronavirus outbreak. Consequences of misinformation dissemination regarding disease include psychosocial; economic; health status; health system and ethical ones. Active and effective presence of health professionals and authorities on social media during the crisis and the improvement of public health literacy in the long term are the most recommended strategies for dealing with issues related to misinformation.

This review explores the landscape of recent evidence for telehealth in T1D care. RECENT FINDINGS Telemedicine for routine T1D care has shown equivalence to standard in-person care, with respect to glycemic control, while also increasing access, convenience, and satisfaction. Telehealth use promotes increased engagement of adolescents with T1D. Telehealth platforms have successfully been used in the care of microvascular complications and to support mental health related to diabetes. Machine learning and advanced decision support will increasingly be used to augment T1D care, as recent evidence suggests increasing capabilities to improve glycemic control. A spectrum of digital connected care services are emerging to support people with diabetes with daily management of diabetes. Finally, policy and systems are required that promote data interoperability, telemedicine provision, and reimbursement to support the ongoing growth of telehealth in T1D. SUMMARY A developing field of evidence supports use of telehealth in T1D. As this care modality scales, it has the potential to increase access to high-quality diabetes care for many people with T1D.","Kompala, Tejaswi; Neinstein, Aaron B","Current opinion in endocrinology, diabetes, and obesity",96,1

While 61.0% of gynecological cancer survivors (GCS) in Japan belonged to a working-age group (20-64 years old), the number of working GCS within the working-age population has increased. In Japan, it seems that there has been more interest in striking a balance between cancer treatment and work, especially since 2016 when the Cancer Control Act was amended and national guidelines for working CSs were published. Maintaining employment after gynecological cancer diagnosis remains an important issue for not only GCS and their families but also employers and society. GCS suffered from various symptoms including cancer-related fatigue, pain, menopausal symptoms, lymphedema, and psychological distress, which made maintaining employment difficult for them. Full return to work (RTW) rate at 365 days after the initial days of sick leave among was 77.6% and median time to full RTW among GCSs was 172 days. Five-year work continuance rate after RTW among GCSs was 63.4%.

In the present study, the interaction of remdesivir and its nucleoside analog GS-441524 with OATP4C1 was evaluated to provide the detailed information about its renal handling. METHODS We used HK-2 cells, a proximal tubular cell line derived from normal kidney, to confirm the transport of remdesivir and GS-441524. To assess the involvement of OATP4C1 in handling remdesivir and GS-441524, the uptake study of remdesivir and GS-441524 was performed by using OATP4C1-overexpressing Madin-Darby canine kidney II (MDCKII) cells. Moreover, we also evaluated the IC50 and Ki value of remdesivir. RESULTS The time-dependent remdesivir uptake in HK-2 cells was observed. The results of inhibition study using OATs and OCT2 inhibitors and OATP4C1 knockdown suggested the involvement of renal drug transporter OATP4C1. Remdesivir was taken up by OATP4C1/MDCKII cells. OATP4C1-mediated uptake of remdesivir increased linearly up to 10 min and reached a steady state at 30 min. Remdesivir inhibited OATP4C1-mediated transport in a concentration-dependent manner with the IC50 and apparent Ki values of 42 ± 7.8 μM and 37 ± 6.9 μM, respectively. CONCLUSIONS We have provided novel information about renal handling of remdesivir. Furthermore, we evaluated the potential drug interaction via OATP4C1 by calculating the Ki value of remdesivir. OATP4C1 may play a pivotal role in remdesivir therapy for COVID-19, particularly in patients with kidney injury.","Sato, Toshihiro; Maekawa, Masamitsu; Mano, Nariyasu; Abe, Takaaki; Yamaguchi, Hiroaki","Journal of pharmacy & pharmaceutical sciences : a publication of the Canadian Society for Pharmaceutical Sciences, Societe canadienne des sciences pharmaceutiques",96,12

However, the histopathological characteristics of retrieved thrombi in patients with cancer have not been well studied. This study aimed to assess the histopathological difference between thrombi in patients with and without cancer. METHODS We studied consecutive patients with acute major cerebral artery occlusion who were treated with endovascular therapy between October 2010 and December 2016 in our single-center registry. The retrieved thrombi were histopathologically investigated with hematoxylin and eosin and Masson's trichrome staining. The organization and proportions of erythrocyte and fibrin/platelet components were studied using a lattice composed of 10×10 squares. RESULTS Of the 180 patients studied, 17 (8 women, age 76.5±11.5 years) had cancer and 163 (69 women, age 74.1±11.2 years) did not. Those with cancer had a higher proportion of fibrin/platelets (56.6±27.4% vs 40.1±23.9%, p=0.008), a smaller proportion of erythrocytes (42.1±28.3% vs 57.5±25.1%, p=0.019), and higher serum D-dimer levels (5.9±8.2 vs 2.4±4.3 mg/dL, p=0.005) compared with the non-cancer cases. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed the cut-off ratio of fibrin/platelet components related to cancer was 55.7% with a sensitivity of 74.8%, specificity 58.8% and area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.67 (95% CI 0.53 to 0.81), and the cut-off ratio of erythrocyte components was 44.7% with a sensitivity of 71.2%, specificity 58.9% and AUC value of 0.66 (95% CI 0.51 to 0.80).

There has been limited work characterizing how these substances impact bacterial growth and antibiotic resistance development. We investigated how two ciprofloxacin (CIP) impurities, fluoroquinolonic acid (FQA) and ciprofloxacin ethylenediamine analog (CEA), impact growth and antibiotic resistance in Escherichia coli. Additionally, we investigated how these impurities impact a frequently used API content assay. Both impurities displayed modest antimicrobial activity compared to the CIP API. The effective antimicrobial activity of a medicine containing increased impurity levels may permit bacterial growth and resistance development. Our results also suggest that increasing exposure concentration and duration to CEA and FQA, independent of CIP, can promote antibiotic resistance development. However, at concentrations of 100% and below the MIC of the API, they have limited contributions to resistance development compared to the CIP API. From a methodological standpoint, we find that UV spectrophotometry may be inadequate to account for antibiotic impurities or degradation products. This can lead to incorrect estimations of API content and we propose additional multi-wavelength measures when using UV spectrophotometry to help identify impurities or degradation.","Ching, Carly; Zaman, Muhammad H",Letters in applied microbiology,96,1

MATERIAL AND METHODS The modified online OSCE comprising of eight question entities was organized simultaneously in all four dental institutes of Finland using the Moodle virtual learning environment. All fourth-year students (n=179) attended the exam online at home. Student feedback was collected via an anonymous questionnaire with multiple-choice questions and open-ended questions concerning attitudes towards the modified online OSCE, as well as content and usability of the question entities in the exam. Means and standard deviations were calculated for multiple-choice questions. Content analysis was used for open-ended questions. RESULTS Of 179 students, 119 (66%) consented to the study. Students experienced they had received adequate information (mean 3.8; SD 1.2), had a positive attitude before the exam (4.0; 1.0) and found the practice test useful (3.7; 1.1) (range 1-5). Technical implementation (2.7; 0.7) and the difficulty of the questions (2.9; 0.6) (range 1-4) were found to be good. The teaching students received during their studies was sufficient (3.2; 0.5) (range 1-4). Content (mean 3.2; 0.4) and usability (2.9; 0.4) of the question entities were good (range 1-4). The themes arising from open-ended questions were importance and practicality of the topic (in questions) in relation to the work of a dentist and gratitude for the rapid conversion of the OSCE into an online exam despite Covid-19. The themes arising from negative experiences included difficulties in completing the exam within the time allocated, and dissatisfaction with the model answers provided after the exam. CONCLUSION The positive student feedback towards the modified online OSCE encourages including an online exam to complement the traditional OSCE.","Hytönen, Hanna; Näpänkangas, Ritva; Karaharju-Suvanto, Terhi; Eväsoja, Taina; Kallio, Anu; Kokkari, Anne; Tuononen, Tiina; Lahti, Satu",European journal of dental education : official journal of the Association for Dental Education in Europe,96,17

However, measurements of and factors affecting bar displacement have not been reported. The objectives of this study were to develop a decision model to guide surgeons considering repeat treatment and to estimate optimal cut-off values to determine whether reoperation to correct bar displacement is warranted. METHODS From July 2011 to August 2013, ninety bars were inserted in 61 patients who underwent Nuss procedures for pectus excavatum. Group A did not need surgical intervention and Group B required reoperation for bar displacement. Bar position was measured as the distance from the posterior superior end of the sternal body to the upper border of the metal bar on lateral chest radiographs. The bar displacement index (BDI) was calculated using D0 - Dx / D0 x 100 (D0: bar position the day after surgery; Dx: minimal or maximal distance of bar position on the following postoperative days). The optimal cut-off values of BDI warranting reoperation were assessed on the basis of ROC curve analysis. RESULTS Of the 61 patients, 32 had single bars inserted whereas 29 had parallel bars inserted. There was a significant difference in age (14.0 ± 7.5 vs. 23.3 ± 12.0, p = 0.0062), preoperative Haller index (HI) (4.0 ± 1.1 vs. 5.0 ± 1.0, p = 0.033), and postoperative HI (2.7 ± 0.4 vs. 3.2 ± 0.5 p = 0.006) between the two groups. The optimal cut-off value of BDI was 8.7. CONCLUSIONS We developed a BDI model for surgeons considering performing reoperation after Nuss procedure. The optimal cut-off value of BDI was 8.7. This model may help surgeons to decide objectively whether corrective surgery should be performed. The main factors affecting the relationship between bar displacement and reoperation were age and preoperative HI.","Sa, Young Jo; Lee, Jongho; Jeong, Jin Yong; Choi, Moonhee; Park, Soo Seog; Sim, Sung Bo; Jo, Keon Hyon",Journal of cardiothoracic surgery,96,24

A potential limitation to the use of in vitro assay data in regulatory decision-making is the lack of coverage for xenobiotic metabolic processes. Both hepatic- and peripheral-tissue metabolism can yield metabolites that exhibit greater activity than the parent compound (bioactivation) or are inactive (bioinactivation) for a given biological target. Interpretation of biological effect data for both putative EAS, as well as other chemicals, screened in HTS assays may benefit from the addition of xenobiotic metabolic capabilities to decrease the uncertainty in predicting potential hazards to human health. The objective of this study was to develop an approach to retrofit existing HTS assays with hepatic metabolism. The Alginate Immobilization of Metabolic Enzymes (AIME) platform encapsulates hepatic S9 fractions in alginate microspheres attached to 96-well peg lids. Functional characterization across a panel of reference substrates for phase I cytochrome P450 enzymes revealed substrate depletion with expected metabolite accumulation. Performance of the AIME method in the VM7Luc estrogen receptor (ER) transactivation assay was evaluated across 15 reference chemicals and 48 test chemicals that yield metabolites previously identified as ER active or inactive. The results demonstrate the utility of applying the AIME method for identification of false positive and false negative target assay effects, reprioritization of hazard based on metabolism-dependent bioactivity, and enhanced in vivo concordance with the rodent uterotrophic bioassay. Integration of the AIME metabolism method may prove useful for future biochemical and cell-based HTS applications.","Deisenroth, Chad; DeGroot, Danica E; Zurlinden, Todd; Eicher, Andrew; McCord, James; Lee, Mi-Young; Carmichael, Paul; Thomas, Russell S",Toxicological sciences : an official journal of the Society of Toxicology,96,1

While there is evidence that the burden of COVID-19 infection in hospitalized children is lesser than in their adult counterparts, to date, there are only limited reports describing COVID-19 in pediatric intensive care units (PICUs). Objective To provide an early description and characterization of COVID-19 infection in North American PICUs, focusing on mode of presentation, presence of comorbidities, severity of disease, therapeutic interventions, clinical trajectory, and early outcomes. Design, Setting, and Participants This cross-sectional study included children positive for COVID-19 admitted to 46 North American PICUs between March 14 and April 3, 2020. with follow-up to April 10, 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures Prehospital characteristics, clinical trajectory, and hospital outcomes of children admitted to PICUs with confirmed COVID-19 infection. Results Of the 48 children with COVID-19 admitted to participating PICUs, 25 (52%) were male, and the median (range) age was 13 (4.2-16.6) years. Forty patients (83%) had significant preexisting comorbidities; 35 (73%) presented with respiratory symptoms and 18 (38%) required invasive ventilation. Eleven patients (23%) had failure of 2 or more organ systems. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was required for 1 patient (2%). Targeted therapies were used in 28 patients (61%), with hydroxychloroquine being the most commonly used agent either alone (11 patients) or in combination (10 patients). At the completion of the follow-up period, 2 patients (4%) had died and 15 (31%) were still hospitalized, with 3 still requiring ventilatory support and 1 receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The median (range) PICU and hospital lengths of stay for those who had been discharged were 5 (3-9) days and 7 (4-13) days, respectively. Conclusions and Relevance This early report describes the burden of COVID-19 infection in North American PICUs and confirms that severe illness in children is significant but far less frequent than in adults. Prehospital comorbidities appear to be an important factor in children. These preliminary observations provide an important platform for larger and more extensive studies of children with COVID-19 infection.","Shekerdemian, Lara S; Mahmood, Nabihah R; Wolfe, Katie K; Riggs, Becky J; Ross, Catherine E; McKiernan, Christine A; Heidemann, Sabrina M; Kleinman, Lawrence C; Sen, Anita I; Hall, Mark W; Priestley, Margaret A; McGuire, John K; Boukas, Konstantinos; Sharron, Matthew P; Burns, Jeffrey P",JAMA pediatrics,96,1

Blood volume expansion is commonly used to increase ECMO flow (QECMO), with risk of positive fluid balance and worsening prognosis. We studied the effects of vasoconstriction on recruitment of blood volume as an alternative for increasing QECMO, based on the concepts of venous return. METHODS In a closed chest, centrally cannulated porcine preparation (n = 9) in ventricular fibrillation and VA-ECMO with vented left atrium, mean systemic filling pressure (MSFP), and venous return driving pressure (VRdP) were determined in Euvolemia, during Vasoconstriction (norepinephrine 0.05, 0.125, and 0.2 μg/kg/min) and after Volume Expansion (3 boluses of 10 mL/kg Ringer's lactate). Maximum achievable QECMO was examined. RESULTS Vasoconstriction and Volume Expansion both increased maximum achievable QECMO, delivery of oxygen (DO2), and MSFP, but right atrial pressure increased in parallel. VRdP did not change. The vascular elastance curve was shifted to the left by Vasoconstriction, with recruitment of stressed volume. It was shifted to the right by Volume Expansion with direct expansion of stressed volume. Volume Expansion decreased resistance to venous return and pump afterload. CONCLUSIONS In a circulation completely dependent on ECMO support, maximum achievable flow directly depended on the vascular factors governing venous return-i.e., closing conditions, stressed vascular volume and the elastance and resistive properties of the vasculature. Both treatments increased maximum achievable ECMO flow at stable DO2, via increases in stressed volume by different mechanisms. Vascular resistance and pump afterload decreased with Volume Expansion.","Moller, Per W; Hana, Anisa; Heinisch, Paul Philipp; Liu, Shengchen; Djafarzadeh, Siamak; Haenggi, Matthias; Bloch, Andreas; Takala, Jukka; Jakob, Stephan M; Berger, David",Shock,96,12

N- and C-terminal domains may harbor enzymatic functions important for viral mRNA synthesis, including capping enzymes or cap-snatching endoribonucleases. In the present study, we have employed a large-scale mutagenesis approach to map functionally relevant residues in these regions. The main targets were acidic (Asp and Glu) and basic residues (Lys and Arg) known to form catalytic and binding sites of capping enzymes and endoribonucleases. A total of 149 different mutants were generated and tested in the Lassa virus replicon system. Nearly 25% of evolutionarily highly conserved acidic and basic side chains were dispensable for function of L protein in the replicon context. The vast majority of the remaining mutants had defects in both transcription and replication. Seven residues (Asp-89, Glu-102, Asp-119, Lys-122, Asp-129, Glu-180, and Arg-185) were selectively important for mRNA synthesis. The phenotype was particularly pronounced for Asp-89, Glu-102, and Asp-129, which were indispensable for transcription but could be replaced by a variety of amino acid residues without affecting genome replication. Bioinformatics disclosed the remote similarity of this region to type IIs endonucleases. The mutagenesis was complemented by experiments with the RNA polymerase II inhibitor alpha-amanitin, demonstrating dependence of viral transcription from the cellular mRNA pool. In conclusion, this paper describes an N-terminal region in L protein being important for mRNA, but not genome synthesis. Bioinformatics and cell biological experiments lend support to the hypothesis that this region could be part of a cap-snatching enzyme.","Lelke, Michaela; Brunotte, Linda; Busch, Carola; Günther, Stephan",Journal of virology,96,1

Based on our in vivo experience with digitoxin as an inhibitor of TNFα-driven NFĸB signaling for cytokine expression in prostate cancer in rats and in cystic fibrosis in humans, we hypothesize that this drug will also block a virally-activated cytokine storm. Materials Methods: Digitoxin was administered intraperitoneally to cotton rats, followed by intranasal infection with 107TCID50/100 g of cotton rat with influenza strain A/Wuhan/H3N2/359/95. Daily digitoxin treatment continued until harvest on day 4 of the experiment. RESULTS The cardiac glycoside digitoxin significantly and differentially suppressed levels of the cytokines TNFα, GRO/KC, MIP2, MCP1, and IFNγ, in the cotton rat lung in the presence of influenza virus. CONCLUSION Since cytokine storm is a host response, we suggest that digitoxin may have a therapeutic potential not only for influenza and but also for coronavirus infections.","Pollard, Bette S; BLANCOl, Jorge C; Pollard, John R",In vivo,96,12

However, little is known about the coinfection status of PAstVs. For differential and simultaneous diagnoses of these five genotypes of PAstVs, a multiplex RT-PCR method was established on the basis of the ORF2 gene of type 1 PAstV, and the ORF1ab genes of type two to five PAstVs. This quintuple PCR system was developed through optimization of multiplex PCR and detection sensitivity and specificity. The results showed that this multiplex RT-PCR method could specifically detect all the five PAstV genotypes without cross-reaction to any other major viruses circulating in Chinese pig farms. The detection limit of this method was as low as 10 pg of standard plasmids of each PAstV genotype. In addition, a total of 275 fecal samples collected from different districts of Guangxi, China, between April 2019 and November 2020, were tested by this newly established multiplex RT-PCR. Moreover, the sensitivity and specificity of monoplex and multiplex RT-PCR methods were compared by detecting the same set of clinical positive samples. The results revealed that PAstV1 (31/275), PAstV2 (49/275), PAstV3 (36/275), PAstV4 (41/275), and PAstV5 (22/275) were all detected, and dual (PAstV1+PAstV2, PAstV1+PAstV3, PAstV2+PAstV3, PAstV2+PAstV4, PAstV3+PAstV4, and PAstV4+PAstV5) or triple genotypes (PAstV1+PAstV2+PAstV3 and PAstV2+PAstV3+PAstV4) of coinfections were also unveiled in this study. The detection result of multiplex PCR was consistent with that of monoplex PCR. Compared with monoplex PCR, this multiplex PCR method showed obvious advantages such as time and cost efficiency and high sensitivity and specificity. This multiplex RT-PCR method offered a valuable tool for the rapid and accurate detection of PAstV genotypes circulating in pig herds and will facilitate the surveillance of PAstV coinfection status.","Liu, Xin; Zhang, Wenchao; Wang, Dongjing; Zhu, Xinyue; Chen, Ying; Ouyang, Kang; Wei, Zuzhang; Liu, Huan; Huang, Weijian",Frontiers in veterinary science,96,7

The process and its consequences, for example the generation of viruses with novel phenotypes, has historically been studied by analysis of the end products. More recently, with an appreciation that there are both replicative and non-replicative mechanisms at work, and with new approaches and techniques to analyse intermediate products, the viral and cellular factors that influence the process are becoming understood. The major influence on replicative recombination is the fidelity of viral polymerase, although RNA structures and sequences may also have an impact. In replicative recombination the viral polymerase is necessary and sufficient, although roles for other viral or cellular proteins may exist. In contrast, non-replicative recombination appears to be mediated solely by cellular components. Despite these insights, the relative importance of replicative and non-replicative mechanisms is not clear. Using single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses as exemplars, we review the current state of understanding of the processes and consequences of recombination.","Bentley, Kirsten; Evans, David J",The Journal of general virology,96,11

Traditional approaches to the sociology of the professions support this, seeing professionalization as an ongoing process of enclosure, encroachment, and conflict. Recent work, however, has emphasized the fluidity and collaborative nature of professionalization projects, and placed more emphasis on inter-professional negotiations and disciplinary coexistence. In this paper, we draw on this work to analyze the harmonization of the independent Mensendieck System of medical gymnastics in Norway, and the emerging state-sponsored physiotherapy system. Our contention is that over the course of the middle decades of the 20th century, advocates of the Mensendieck System and providers of orthodox, biomedically informed physiotherapy, came together and found a way to work collaboratively in a shared space without compromising their distinctive professional identities. We argue that this approach both points to ways we might revisit traditional conflict-based analyses of the history of physiotherapy, while also suggesting new ways of imagining how the profession might change in the years to come.","Dahl-Michelsen, Tone; Nicholls, David A; Messel, Jan; Groven, Karen Synne",Physiotherapy theory and practice,96,27

In the present study, we investigated such cell-cell interaction between mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) and cerebral endothelial cells. In contrast to BM-MNC, for MSC we observed suppression of vascular endothelial growth factor uptake into endothelial cells and transfer of glucose from endothelial cells to MSC in vitro. The transfer of such a small molecule from MSC to vascular endothelium was subsequently confirmed in vivo and was followed by suppressed activation of macrophage/microglia in stroke mice. The suppressive effect was absent by blockade of gap junction at MSC. Furthermore, gap junction-mediated cell-cell interaction was observed between circulating white blood cells and MSC. Our findings indicate that gap junction-mediated cell-cell interaction is one of the major pathways for MSC-mediated suppression of inflammation in the brain following stroke and provides a novel strategy to maintain the blood-brain barrier in injured brain. Furthermore, our current results have the potential to provide a novel insight for other ongoing clinical trials that make use of MSC transplantation aiming to suppress excess inflammation, as well as other diseases such as COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019).","Kikuchi-Taura, Akie; Okinaka, Yuka; Saino, Orie; Takeuchi, Yukiko; Ogawa, Yuko; Kimura, Takafumi; Gul, Sheraz; Claussen, Carsten; Boltze, Johannes; Taguchi, Akihiko",Stem cells,96,1

Genetic variation generated through hybridization between distantly related lineages can promote AR. This mechanism, however, requires rare coincidence in space and time between a hybridization event and opening of ecological opportunity, because hybridization generates large genetic variation only locally and it will persist only for a short period. Hence, hybridization seems unlikely to explain recurrent AR in the same lineage. Contrary to these expectations, our evolutionary computer simulations demonstrate that admixture variation can geographically spread and persist for long periods if the hybrid population becomes separated into isolated sub-lineages. Subsequent secondary hybridization of some of these can reestablish genetic polymorphisms from the ancestral hybridization in places far from the birthplace of the hybrid clade and long after the ancestral hybridization event. Consequently, simulations revealed conditions where exceptional genetic variation, once generated through a rare hybridization event, can facilitate multiple ARs exploiting ecological opportunities available at distant points in time and space.","Kagawa, Kotaro; Seehausen, Ole",Proceedings.

The aim of the current study was to determine whether resection margins of 10 mm provide a survival benefit over narrower resection margins. METHODS A total of 425 laparoscopic liver resections were carried out in 351 procedures performed in 317 patients between August 1998 and April 2012. Primary laparoscopic liver resections for colorectal metastases were included in the study. Two-stage resections, procedures accompanied by concomitant liver ablations and one case of perioperative mortality were excluded. A total of 155 eligible patients were classified into four groups according to resection margin width: Group 1, margins of < 1 mm [n = 33, including 17 patients with positive margins (Group 1a)]; Group 2, margins of 1 mm to < 3 mm (n = 31); Group 3, margins of ≥ 3 mm to <10 mm (n = 55), and Group 4, margins of ≥ 10 mm (n = 36). Perioperative and survival data were compared across the groups. Median follow-up was 31 months (range: 2-136 months). RESULTS Perioperative outcomes were similar in all groups. Unfavourable intraoperative incidents occurred in 9.7% of procedures (including 3.2% of conversions). Postoperative complications developed in 11.0% of patients. Recurrence in the resection bed developed in three (1.9%) patients, including two (6.1%) patients in Group 1. Rates of actuarial 5-year overall, disease-free and recurrence-free survival were 49%, 41% and 33%, respectively. Median survival was 65 months. Margin status had no significant impact on patient survival. The Basingstoke Predictive Index (BPI) generally underestimated survival. This underestimation was especially marked in Group 1 when postoperative BPI was applied. CONCLUSIONS Patients with margins of <1 mm achieved survival comparable with that in patients with margins of ≥ 10 mm. When modern surgical equipment that generates an additional coagulation zone is applied, the association between resection margin and survival may not be apparent. Further studies in this field are required. Postoperative BPI, which includes margin status among the core factors predicting postoperative survival, seems to be less precise than preoperative BPI.","Postriganova, Nadya; Kazaryan, Airazat M; Røsok, Bård I; Fretland, Åsmund A; Barkhatov, Leonid; Edwin, Bjørn",HPB : the official journal of the International Hepato Pancreato Biliary Association,96,1

RECENT FINDINGS SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, similar to those of SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, spontaneously samples different prefusion states with the receptor-binding domain (RBD) adopting 'up' or 'down' conformations, and the RBD 'down' to 'up' conformational change is required for ACE2 binding. Receptor binding and spike glycoprotein priming by host proteases such as furin and transmembrane protease serine 2 induce pre to postfusion conformational changes of the spike trimer that enable membrane fusion. Interactions between SARS-CoV-2 RBD and ACE2 were elucidated at atomic resolution using high-resolution crystal structures. These structures, together with adapted and remodeled SARS-CoV-2 strains, further revealed critical residues of the spike glycoprotein for SARS-CoV-2 infection and cross-species transmission. SUMMARY Recent studies on SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein provide important structural knowledge for a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection and cross-species transmission.","Ge, Jiwan; Zhang, Senyan; Zhang, Linqi; Wang, Xinquan",Current opinion in HIV and AIDS,96,33

A model that simulates the spatiotemporal spread of infectious diseases between animal populations was developed. Sixteen scenarios of foot-and-mouth disease infection in cattle were analyzed, involving combinations of the following factors: multiple production-types (PT) with heterogeneous contact and population structure versus single PT, random versus actual spatial distribution of population units, high versus low infectivity, and no vaccination versus preemptive vaccination. The epidemic size and duration was larger for scenarios with multiple PT versus single PT. Ignoring the actual unit locations did not affect the epidemic size in scenarios with multiple PT/high infectivity, but resulted in smaller epidemic sizes in scenarios using multiple PT/low infectivity. In conclusion, when modeling fast-spreading epidemics, knowing the actual locations of population units may not be as relevant as collecting information on population and contact heterogeneity. In contrast, both population and spatial heterogeneity might be important to model slower spreading epidemic diseases. Our findings can be used to inform data collection and modeling efforts to inform health policy and planning.","Zagmutt, Francisco J; Schoenbaum, Mark A; Hill, Ashley E",Risk analysis : an official publication of the Society for Risk Analysis,96,1

Due to the biological complexity of the disease, OA remains highly heterogeneous. Although much work has been undertaken in the past few years, underlying molecular mechanisms leading to joint tissue structural deterioration are not fully understood, with only few validated markers for disease diagnosis and progression being available. Discovery and quantitation of various OA-specific biomarkers is still largely focused on the bodily fluids which does not appear to be reliable and sensitive enough. However, with the advancement of spatial proteomic techniques, several novel peptides and proteins, as well as N-glycans, can be identified and localised in a reliable and sensitive manner. To summarise the important findings from OA biomarker studies, papers published between 2000 and 2020 were searched via Google Scholar and PubMed. Medical subject heading (MeSH) terms 'osteoarthritis', 'biomarker', 'synovial fluid', 'serum', 'urine', 'matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation', 'mass spectrometry imaging', 'proteomic', 'glycomic', 'cartilage', 'synovium' AND 'subchondral bone' were selectively used. The literature search was restricted to full-text original research articles and written only in English. Two main areas were reviewed for OA biomarker studies: (1) an overview of disease-specific markers detected from different types of OA bio-samples, and (2) an up-to-date summary of the tissue-specific OA studies that have utilised matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI). Overall, these OA biomarkers could provide clinicians with information for better the diagnosis, and prognosis of individual patients, and ultimately help facilitate the development of disease-modifying treatments.","Lee, Yea-Rin; Briggs, Matthew T; Condina, Mark R; Puddy, Hamish; Anderson, Paul H; Hoffmann, Peter; Kuliwaba, Julia S",International journal of molecular sciences,96,1

A thorough understanding of the current body of evidence regarding benefits and risks of these interventions is required. OBJECTIVES: Using a living systematic review approach, to assess whether convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulin transfusion is effective and safe in the treatment of people with COVID-19; and to maintain the currency of the evidence. SEARCH METHODS To identify completed and ongoing studies, we searched the World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease Research Database, MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, the Epistemonikos COVID-19 L*OVE Platform, and trial registries. Searches were done on 17 March 2021. SELECTION CRITERIA We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulin for COVID-19, irrespective of disease severity, age, gender or ethnicity. For safety assessments, we also included non-controlled non-randomised studies of interventions (NRSIs) if 500 or more participants were included. We excluded studies that included populations with other coronavirus diseases (severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)), as well as studies evaluating standard immunoglobulin. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS We followed standard Cochrane methodology. To assess bias in included studies, we used the Cochrane 'Risk of Bias 2' tool for RCTs, and for NRSIs, the assessment criteria for observational studies, provided by Cochrane Childhood Cancer. We rated the certainty of evidence, using the GRADE approach, for the following outcomes: all-cause mortality, improvement and worsening of clinical status (for individuals with moderate to severe disease), development of severe clinical COVID-19 symptoms (for individuals with asymptomatic or mild disease), quality of life (including fatigue and functional independence), grade 3 or 4 adverse events, and serious adverse events. MAIN RESULTS We included 13 studies (12 RCTs, 1 NRSI) with 48,509 participants, of whom 41,880 received convalescent plasma. We did not identify any completed studies evaluating hyperimmune immunoglobulin. We identified a further 100 ongoing studies evaluating convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulin, and 33 studies reporting as being completed or terminated. Individuals with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 and moderate to severe disease Eleven RCTs and one NRSI investigated the use of convalescent plasma for 48,349 participants with moderate to severe disease. Nine RCTs compared convalescent plasma to placebo treatment or standard care alone, and two compared convalescent plasma to standard plasma (results not included in abstract). Effectiveness of convalescent plasma We included data on nine RCTs (12,875 participants) to assess the effectiveness of convalescent plasma compared to placebo or standard care alone. Convalescent plasma does not reduce all-cause mortality at up to day 28 (risk ratio (RR) 0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.92 to 1.05; 7 RCTs, 12,646 participants; high-certainty evidence). It has little to no impact on clinical improvement for all participants when assessed by liberation from respiratory support (RR not estimable; 8 RCTs, 12,682 participants; high-certainty evidence). It has little to no impact on the chance of being weaned or liberated from invasive mechanical ventilation for the subgroup of participants requiring invasive mechanical ventilation at baseline (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.93; 2 RCTs, 630 participants; low-certainty evidence). It does not reduce the need for invasive mechanical ventilation (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.08; 4 RCTs, 11,765 participants; high-certainty evidence). We did not identify any subgroup differences. We did not identify any studies reporting quality of life, and therefore, do not know whether convalescent plasma has any impact on quality of life. One RCT assessed resolution of fatigue on day 7, but we are very uncertain about the effect (RR 1.21, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.42; 309 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Safety of convalescent plasma We included results from eight RCTs, and one NRSI, to assess the safety of convalescent plasma. Some of the RCTs reported on safety data only for the convalescent plasma group. We are uncertain whether convalescent plasma increases or reduces the risk of grade 3 and 4 adverse events (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.41; 4 RCTs, 905 participants; low-certainty evidence), and serious adverse events (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.90; 2 RCTs, 414 participants; low-certainty evidence). A summary of reported events of the NRSI (reporting safety data for 20,000 of 35,322 transfused participants), and four RCTs reporting safety data only for transfused participants (6125 participants) are included in the full text. Individuals with a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection and asymptomatic or mild disease We identified one RCT reporting on 160 participants, comparing convalescent plasma to placebo treatment (saline). Effectiveness of convalescent plasma We are very uncertain about the effect of convalescent plasma on all-cause mortality (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.09 to 2.65; very low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain about the effect of convalescent plasma on developing severe clinical COVID-19 symptoms (RR not estimable; low-certainty evidence). We identified no study reporting quality of life. Safety of convalescent plasma We do not know whether convalescent plasma is associated with a higher risk of grade 3 or 4 adverse events (very low-certainty evidence), or serious adverse events (very low-certainty evidence). This is a living systematic review. We search weekly for new evidence and update the review when we identify relevant new evidence. Please refer to the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for the current status of this review. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS We have high certainty in the evidence that convalescent plasma for the treatment of individuals with moderate to severe disease does not reduce mortality and has little to no impact on measures of clinical improvement. We are uncertain about the adverse effects of convalescent plasma. While major efforts to conduct research on COVID-19 are being made, heterogeneous reporting of outcomes is still problematic. There are 100 ongoing studies and 33 studies reporting in a study registry as being completed or terminated. Publication of ongoing studies might resolve some of the uncertainties around hyperimmune immunoglobulin therapy for people with any disease severity, and convalescent plasma therapy for people with asymptomatic or mild disease.","Piechotta, Vanessa; Iannizzi, Claire; Chai, Khai Li; Valk, Sarah J; Kimber, Catherine; Dorando, Elena; Monsef, Ina; Wood, Erica M; Lamikanra, Abigail A; Roberts, David J; McQuilten, Zoe; So-Osman, Cynthia; Estcourt, Lise J; Skoetz, Nicole",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,96,16

METHODS Altmetric Attention scores were collected for all articles in five leading radiology journals over a 5-year period ending in June 2020, and temporal smoothing yielded the filtered Altmetric Attention (fAA) score. Natural language processing methods were used to label articles with major topic areas. A forecasting model was used to identify periods of outlier behavior in the fAA score aggregated across all journals, for each journal individually, and stratified by article topic area. The distributions of fAA scores prior to the onset of the pandemic were statistically compared to those during the pandemic. For journals exhibiting increased fAA scores, the frequency distributions of articles not related to Covid-19 was compared to that prior to the pandemic. RESULTS During the pandemic, we found sustained outliers and statistically significant increases in the aggregate fAA score across all five journals, as well as for Radiology, American Journal of Roentgenology, and Academic Radiology individually. Articles related to Covid-19, thoracic imaging, and radiology education also experienced significantly increased fAA scores during the pandemic period. We did not find significantly decreased rates of publication of non-Covid articles in the journals experiencing elevated fAA scores. CONCLUSION Social media engagement with the radiological literature significantly increased during the Covid-19 pandemic. This preferentially affected certain journals and articles addressing specific topics, reflecting the intense public interest in the diagnosis and treatment of Covid-19.","Patel, Vishal; Li, Charles H; Acharya, Jay; Lerner, Alexander; Rajamohan, Anandh G",Academic radiology,96,1

The viral genome consists of a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome of >9243 nt excluding the poly(A) tail and as such represents one of the largest picornavirus genomes reported to date. The virus genome is GC-rich with a G+C content of 54.5 %. The genomic organization is similar to other picornaviruses: 5' UTR-L-VP0-VP3-VP1-2A-2B-2C-3A-3B-3C-3D-3' UTR. The partially characterized 5' UTR of >373 nt appears to possess a type II internal ribosomal entry site (IRES), which is also found in members of the genera Aphthovirus and Cardiovirus. This IRES exhibits significant sequence similarity to turkey 'gallivirus A'. The 3' UTR of 278 nt contains the conserved 48 nt 'barbell-like' structure identified in 'passerivirus', 'gallivirus', Avihepatovirus and some Kobuvirus genus members. A predicted large open reading frame (ORF) of 8592 nt encodes a potential polyprotein precursor of 2864 amino acids. In addition, the virus contains a predicted large L protein of 462 amino acids. Pairwise sequence comparisons, along with phylogenetic analysis revealed the highest percentage identity to 'Passerivirus A' (formerly called turdivirus 1), forming a monophyletic group across the P1, P2 and P3 regions, with <40, <40 and <50 % amino acid identity respectively. Reduced identity was observed against 'gallivirus A' and members of the Kobuvirus genus. Quantitative PCR analysis estimated a range of 4×10(5) to 5×10(8) viral genome copies g(-1) in 22 (73 %) of 30 PCR-positive faeces. Based on sequence and phylogenetic analysis, we propose that this virus is the first member of a potential novel genus within the family Picornaviridae. Further studies are required to investigate the pathogenic potential of this virus within the avian host.","Bullman, Susan; Kearney, Karen; O'Mahony, Michael; Kelly, Lorraine; Whyte, Paul; Fanning, Seamus; Morgan, John G",The Journal of general virology,96,5

To achieve rapid identification of new lead compounds, high-throughput screening assays have been employed in many pharmaceutical companies and laboratories. However, their success depends on the assay system relevant to in vivo conditions and they are physically limited by the repertoire of compounds. As an alternative or complementary approach to high-throughput screening assays, virtual screening is an efficient method to identify drug candidates in silico from large chemical compound databases. Its usefulness has been verified by current applications that successfully retrieved hit and lead identifications against various disease targets.

Data on subject characteristics, exposure, diagnostic criterion, and outcomes were extracted from included studies using a standardized extraction form and were presented narratively. Of the 2,290 references identified by the search, 106 studies with a total of 37,515 participants met inclusion criteria for blast-related mTBI. All but nine studies were based out of military or Veteran medical facilities. Unsurprisingly, men were over-represented (75-100%). The criteria used to define blast-related mTBI were consistent; however, the methodology used to ascertain whether individuals met those criteria for diagnosis were inconsistent. The diagnosis, most prevalent among the Army, heavily relied on self-reported histories. Commonly reported adverse outcomes included hearing disturbances and headaches. The most frequently associated comorbidities were post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety, sleep disorders, attention disorders, and cognitive disorders. The primary objective of this review was to provide a summary of descriptive data on blast-related mTBI in a U.S. military population.

METHODS We report on a family of three adults who experienced photophobia, intense eye pain, epiphora, blurred vision, and burning sensation over the face and neck area after a short period of unprotected exposure to UV germicidal lamps. RESULTS Initial examination revealed erythema and tenderness over the face and neck area, reduced visual acuity of 6/12, and conjunctival injections bilaterally in all three patients. Further assessment at the ophthalmology department three days later revealed gradual improvement of visual acuity to 6/6 bilaterally. Slit-lamp examinations revealed few punctate epithelial erosions. Fundal examinations were normal without evidence of solar retinopathy. The patients were diagnosed with germicidal-range UV irradiation-induced photokeratitis and epidermal phototoxicity. Lubricants and emollients were prescribed for symptom relief, and the patients were warned against using a UV germicidal lamp for disinfection purposes without appropriate protection. CONCLUSIONS Although SARS-CoV-2 is structurally akin to SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, and previous studies demonstrated high levels of inactivation of beta-coronavirus with germicidal-range UV, evidence for its efficacy to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 is lacking. This case report serves to emphasize the potential consequences of phototoxicity from improper use of UV germicidal lamps for household disinfection as well as to highlight the fact that UV germicidal lamps currently have no established role in household disinfection of SARS-CoV-2.","Leung, Kai Ching Peter; Ko, Tak Chuen Simon",Cornea,96,1

When conservative treatment of chronic obstipation fails, colon irrigation via PEC seems less invasive than surgical interventions. However, previous studies have noted high complication rates of PEC, mostly related to infections. Our aim was to report our experiences with PEC in patients with chronic refractory constipation. METHODS Retrospective analysis of all patients who underwent PEC for refractory constipation in our secondary referral hospital between 2009 and 2016. KEY RESULTS Twelve patients received a PEC for chronic, refractory constipation. Short-term efficacy for relief of constipation symptoms was good in 8 patients and moderate in 4 patients. Two patients had the PEC removed because of spontaneous improvement of constipation. Three patients, who initially noticed a positive effect, preferred an ileostomy over PEC after 1-5 years. One PEC was removed because of an abscess. Long-term efficacy is 50%: 6 patients still use their PEC after 3.3 years of follow-up. No mortality occurred. CONCLUSIONS AND INTERFERENCES PEC offers a technically easily feasible and safe treatment option for patients with chronic constipation not responding to conventional therapy.

The aim of this study was to investigate the safety and efficacy of a novel continuous suture method with barbed sutures during laparoscopic repair for perforated peptic ulcers. PATIENTS AND METHODS Clinical data from 116 consecutive patients undergoing laparoscopic repair for perforated peptic ulcers were collected between November 2009 and October 2015. Continuous suturing with 15-cm-long unidirectional absorbable barbed sutures was used for laparoscopic repair in the study group, termed group V (n = 51). Patients who underwent laparoscopic repair with conventional interrupted sutures were defined as group C (n = 65). The complication and operative data were compared between groups. RESULTS Although there was no difference between group V and group C in the overall complication rate (15.7% vs. 24.6%; p = 0.259), the complication rate related to suturing was lower (3.9% vs. 15.4%; p = 0.04) in group V. Group V showed rates of 0% for leakage, 2% for intra-abdominal fluid collection, and 2% for stricture; the corresponding rates in group C were 3.1, 7.7, and 4.6%, respectively. Regarding operative data, the total operation time (V vs. C, 87.7 min vs. 131.2 min), total suture time (7.1 min vs. 25.3 min), and suture time per stitch (1.2 min vs. 6.2 min) were significantly shorter in group V than in group C (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION The use of a continuous suture technique with unidirectional barbed sutures is as safe as the conventional suture technique and allows easier and faster suturing in the repair of perforated peptic ulcers.","Kim, Tae-Han; Park, Ji-Ho; Jeong, Sang-Ho; Lee, Jin-Kwon; Kwag, Seung-Jin; Kim, Ju-Yeon; Lee, Woohyung; Woo, Jung-Woo; Jang, Jae Yool; Song, Eun-Jin; Park, Taejin; Jeong, Chi-Young; Ju, Young-Tae; Jung, Eun-Jung; Hong, Soon-Chan; Choi, Sang-Kyung; Ha, Woo-Song; Lee, Young-Joon",Surgical endoscopy,96,1

The cytological cases were reclassified as follows: 2 (0.9%) as non-diagnostic (ND), 81 (38.6%) as negative for malignancy (NFM), 4 (1.9%) as atypia of undetermined significance (AUS), 11 (5.2%) as suspicious for malignancy (SFM), 112 (53.4%) as malignant (MAL). Sarcomatoid cells in the MAL category were characterised cytomorphologically by more pronounced discohesion. In comparison with the epithelioid subtype, the tumour cells appeared solitary with moderate or marked nuclear pleomorphism, and irregular chromatin. CONCLUSIONS It is important to recognise the cytological characteristics of this aggressive entity to suggest an early and precise possible diagnosis. Morphological features, coupled with clinico-radiological data may help the clinicians in adequately managing the patients.","Straccia, Patrizia; Magnini, Daniele; Trisolini, Rocco; Lococo, Filippo; Chiappetta, Marco; Cancellieri, Alessandra",Cytopathology : official journal of the British Society for Clinical Cytology,96,1

Until now, pediatric data are scarce. Therefore, we aimed to cross-sectionally investigate the association between ATIs and IFX TLs, and clinical and biochemical disease activity in children receiving IFX for IBD. MATERIAL AND METHODS Children aged <18 years receiving IFX maintenance treatment for Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC) at three Dutch hospitals were included. Prior to two consecutive IFX infusions, IFX TLs and ATI levels were measured. Clinical disease activity was determined by Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) and Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI), for CD and UC, respectively. Biochemical disease activity was assessed by serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and fecal calprotectin (FC). Clinical remission was defined as a PUCAI or PCDAI score of <10. Therapeutic range of IFX was considered 3-7 µg/ml. RESULTS Thirty-nine patients were included (31 CD; 16 females). Median age was 15 years. Median IFX TL was 3.5 µg/ml [IQR 2-7]. Subtherapeutic and supratherapeutic TLs were found in 38% and 23% of children, respectively. ATIs were detected in four patients. A correlation was found between IFX TL and CRP [rs = -0.51; p < 0.01] and FC [rs = -0.49; p < 0.01]. However, when only clinical disease activity was considered, no difference in median TL was found between remission and active disease (resp. 3.5 µg/ml [IQR 2-5] and 2.3 µg/ml [IQR 0.3-4.6]; p = 0.2). CONCLUSIONS IFX TLs are related to biochemical markers of disease activity. This could provide a rationale for monitoring TLs in children receiving IFX for IBD.","Hoekman, Daniël R; Brandse, Johannan F; de Meij, Tim G; Hummel, Thalia Z; Löwenberg, Mark; Benninga, Marc A; D'Haens, Geert R; Kindermann, Angelika",Scandinavian journal of gastroenterology,96,26

To investigate the link between self-touch and disembodiment in healthy participants, we studied the effect of self-touch versus touch produced by another person (other-touch) on experimentally induced disembodiment. In a mixed reality paradigm, across two experiments, participants could see their own body and surroundings with a controllable visual delay and either stroked their own hand with a paintbrush or were stroked with it by the experimenter. Experiment 1 first assessed the sensitivity to temporal multimodal mismatches and delay-induced changes in the sense of body ownership in three conditions, namely self-touch, other-touch and hidden-self-touch (visually occluding the touching hand). In a second block, we compared phenomenological and physiological (threat response) measures of disembodiment between the self-touch and other-touch conditions. Experiment 2 roughly replicated the first block of Experiment 1 but included a condition in which participants performed the self-touch gesture without touching their hand. Such experiment attempted to control for the potential role of efferent signals. Our results show that increasing visual delay generally enhances the feeling of disembodiment, yet the decrease of body ownership is less pronounced during self-touch. For sensitivity to delay between conditions, however, diverging findings are discussed. This study provides evidence for the importance of self-touch in sustaining a healthy sense of body in the context of disembodiment.","Roel Lesur, Marte; Weijs, Marieke Lieve; Nguyen, Thi Dao; Lenggenhager, Bigna",Cognition,96,9

METHODS Seventy patients, 40 years of age or older, undergoing abdominal surgery expected to last three to five hours were randomly assigned to the DES group (n = 35) or the control group (n = 35). Patients in the DES group were maintained with desflurane anesthesia and received BIS monitoring and warming. Patients in the control group were given non-desflurane anesthesia for maintenance, and the usage of BIS monitoring and warming were not mandatory and determined by anesthesia care providers. Early postoperative recovery times were recorded. RESULTS The times to extubation (8.8 ± 8.5 vs 14.7 ± 13.7 min, P = 0.035), eye opening (8.4 ± 8.6 vs 14.4 ± 13.4 min, P = 0.028), responds on command (8.2 ± 8.5 vs 14.4 ± 13.0 min, P = 0.022), and the ACT (23.8 ± 11.4 vs 32.7 ± 15.4 min, P = 0.009) were significantly less in the DES group than that in the control group. The postanesthesia care unit (PACU) length of stay, incidence of prolonged extubation, and surgeon and anesthesiologist satisfaction were similar in two groups. Also, the result of multivariable linear regressions showed that patients who were younger, female, lower BMI and non-DES anesthesia regimen resulted in prolonged extubation.

Given that coping strategies have been reported to influence QoL, our goal was to synthesize existing research about the association between coping strategies and QoL in caregivers of children with chronic illness. We were particularly interested in whether coping strategies may mediate the association between caregiving complexity and QoL, or may modify the association. METHODS We developed an electronic search strategy to identify relevant citations in Medline, EMBASE, PsycINFO and CINAHL. Two reviewers independently assessed retrieved citations against pre-specified inclusion criteria in two stages of screening. One reviewer abstracted data on study characteristics, methods to address confounding, measurement tools, risk of bias, and results with respect to associations of interest. A second reviewer validated extracted data. We summarized results narratively. RESULTS 2602 citations were screened and 185 full-text articles reviewed. The 11 articles that met inclusion criteria addressed 5 diseases and included a total of 2155 caregivers. Ten of the 11 included studies were cross-sectional. We identified some evidence that coping was associated with QoL: in three studies, coping strategies considered to be adaptive were positively associated with psychological QoL while in one study, maladaptive strategies were negatively associated with psychological QoL. Only two studies considered coping as a potential mediating variable in the association between caregiving complexity and parental QoL, with inconsistent findings and challenges in interpreting cross-sectional associations. No studies considered coping as a moderating variable. The variability among instruments used to measure key constructs, particularly coping strategies, made it difficult to synthesize results. CONCLUSIONS We found that coping strategies may be associated with psychological QoL among parents of children with chronic illness. We also identified important research gaps related to the consistent and clear measurement of coping strategies and their prospective association with QoL. Understanding how coping strategies are associated with QoL is important to inform the development of interventions to support families of children with chronic illness.","Fairfax, Alana; Brehaut, Jamie; Colman, Ian; Sikora, Lindsey; Kazakova, Alessia; Chakraborty, Pranesh; Potter, Beth K",BMC pediatrics,96,1

A hashtag, a keyword prefixed with a hash symbol (#), is a feature in Twitter to organize tweets and facilitate effective search among a massive volume of data. In this paper, we propose an automatic hashtag recommendation system that helps users find new hashtags related to their interests on-demand. Methods For hashtag ranking, we propose the Hashtag Frequency-Inverse Hashtag Ubiquity (HF-IHU) ranking scheme, which is a variation of the well-known TF-IDF, that considers hashtag relevancy, as well as data sparseness which is one of the key challenges in analyzing microblog data. Our system is built on top of Hadoop, a leading platform for distributed computing, to provide scalable performance using Map-Reduce. Experiments on a large Twitter data set demonstrate that our method successfully yields relevant hashtags for user's interest and that recommendations are more stable and reliable than ranking tags based on tweet content similarity. Results and conclusions Our results show that HF-IHU can achieve over 30 % hashtag recall when asked to identify the top 10 relevant hashtags for a particular tweet. Furthermore, our method out-performs kNN, k-popularity, and Naïve Bayes by 69, 54, and 17 %, respectively, on recall of the top 200 hashtags.","Otsuka, Eriko; Wallace, Scott A; Chiu, David",Computational social networks,96,24

DISCUSSION This new strain of coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, enters human cells that express angiotensin-converting enzyme II receptors, which exist in the respiratory, gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts and heart, causing coronavirus disease. Transmission occurs essentially through the respiratory tract and the main symptoms are fever, cough and dyspnea. Diagnosis is based on epidemiological, clinical and imaging features and confirmed by nucleic acid testing. CONCLUSION Despite intensive research, the exact origin of the virus and pathophysiology of coronavirus disease is not yet completely known, and clinically approved vaccines and drugs that target severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 are lacking.","Gouveia, Cristina Carvalho; Campos, Luís",Acta medica portuguesa,96,11

Prophylactic plastic pancreatic stent (PPS) placement appears to prevent AP. We evaluated factors associated with post-EP AP by a retrospective analysis of patients with tumors of the duodenal papilla who underwent EP from January 2008 to November 2016 at 2 tertiary care centers. Clinical, laboratory, endoscopic ultrasound parameters, and PPS placement were evaluated. Seventy-two patients underwent EP (37 men), with mean age of 60.3 (31-88) years. Mean main pancreatic duct (MPD) diameter was 0.44 (0.18-1.8) cm. Mean tumor size was 1.8 (0.5-9.6) cm. Tumors were staged as uT1N0, uT2N0, and uT1N1 in 87.5%, 11.1%, and 1.4%. Thirty-eight AEs occurred in 33 (45.8%) patients, with no mortality. Total bilirubin, tumor size, MPD diameter, and PPS placement had odds ratios (ORs) of 0.82, 0.14, 0.00, and 6.43 for AP. Multivariate analysis (PPS placement × MPD diameter) showed ORs of 4.62 (95%CI, 1.03-21.32; p = 0.049) and 0.000 (95%CI, 0.00-0.74; p = 0.042) for AP. In conclusion, patients with jaundice, large tumors, and dilated MPD seem less likely to have post-EP AP. PPS placement was associated with a higher risk of AP, which may question its use.","Taglieri, Eloy; Micelli-Neto, Otávio; Bonin, Eduardo Aimoré; Goldman, Suzan Menasce; Kemp, Rafael; Dos Santos, José Sebastião; Ardengh, José Celso",Scientific reports,96,19

Consequently, novel vaccines are required to facilitate a reduction in Mtb morbidity and mortality. PilVax is a peptide delivery strategy for the generation of highly specific mucosal immune responses and is based on the food-grade bacterium Lactococcus lactis that is used to express selected peptides engineered within the Streptococcus pyogenes M1T1 pilus, allowing for peptide amplification, stabilisation, and enhanced immunogenicity. In the present study, the dominant T cell epitope from the Mtb protein Ag85B was genetically engineered into the pilus backbone subunit and expressed on the surface of L. lactis. Western blot and flow cytometry confirmed formation of pilus containing the peptide DNA sequence. B cell responses in intranasally vaccinated mice were analysed by ELISA while T cell responses were analysed by flow cytometry. Serum titres of peptide specific IgG and IgA were detected, confirming vaccination produced antibodies against the cognate peptide. Peptide-specific IgA was also detected across several mucosal sites sampled. Peptide-specific CD4+ T cells were detected at levels similar to those of mice immunised with BCG. PilVax immunisation resulted in an unexpected increase in the numbers of CD3+ CD4- CD8- (double negative, DN) T cells in the lungs of vaccinated mice. Analysis of cytokine production following stimulation with the cognate peptide showed the major cytokine producing cells to be CD4+ T cells and DN T cells. This study provides insight into the antibody and peptide specific cellular immune responses generated by PilVax vaccination and demonstrates the suitability of this vaccine for conducting a protection study.","Blanchett, Samuel; Tsai, Catherine Jy; Sandford, Sarah; Loh, Jacelyn Ms; Huang, Lucy; Kirman, Joanna R; Proft, Thomas",Immunology and cell biology,96,5

This study investigates if a birth cohort effect will influence the results of clustering on the age of onset, using a large, international database. METHODS The database includes 4037 patients with a diagnosis of bipolar I disorder, previously collected at 36 collection sites in 23 countries. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) were used to adjust the data for country median age, and in some models, birth cohort. Model-based clustering (mixture analysis) was then performed on the age of onset data using the residuals. Clinical variables in subgroups were compared. RESULTS There was a strong birth cohort effect. Without adjusting for the birth cohort, three subgroups were found by clustering. After adjusting for the birth cohort or when considering only those born after 1959, two subgroups were found. With results of either two or three subgroups, the youngest subgroup was more likely to have a family history of mood disorders and a first episode with depressed polarity. However, without adjusting for birth cohort (three subgroups), family history and polarity of the first episode could not be distinguished between the middle and oldest subgroups. CONCLUSION These results using international data confirm prior findings using single country data, that there are subgroups of bipolar I disorder based on the age of onset, and that there is a birth cohort effect. Including the birth cohort adjustment altered the number and characteristics of subgroups detected when clustering by age of onset. Further investigation is needed to determine if combining both approaches will identify subgroups that are more useful for research.","Bauer, M; Glenn, T; Alda, M; Andreassen, O A; Angelopoulos, E; Ardau, R; Baethge, C; Bauer, R; Bellivier, F; Belmaker, R H; Berk, M; Bjella, T D; Bossini, L; Bersudsky, Y; Cheung, E Y W; Conell, J; Del Zompo, M; Dodd, S; Etain, B; Fagiolini, A; Frye, M A; Fountoulakis, K N; Garneau-Fournier, J; Gonzalez-Pinto, A; Harima, H; Hassel, S; Henry, C; Iacovides, A; Isometsä, E T; Kapczinski, F; Kliwicki, S; König, B; Krogh, R; Kunz, M; Lafer, B; Larsen, E R; Lewitzka, U; Lopez-Jaramillo, C; MacQueen, G; Manchia, M; Marsh, W; Martinez-Cengotitabengoa, M; Melle, I; Monteith, S; Morken, G; Munoz, R; Nery, F G; O'Donovan, C; Osher, Y; Pfennig, A; Quiroz, D; Ramesar, R; Rasgon, N; Reif, A; Ritter, P; Rybakowski, J K; Sagduyu, K; Scippa, A M; Severus, E; Simhandl, C; Stein, D J; Strejilevich, S; Hatim Sulaiman, A; Suominen, K; Tagata, H; Tatebayashi, Y; Torrent, C; Vieta, E; Viswanath, B; Wanchoo, M J; Zetin, M; Whybrow, P C",European psychiatry : the journal of the Association of European Psychiatrists,96,12

This study investigates the prevalence of prolonged rhinovirus RNA presence in the upper respiratory tract of infants during the first year of life. METHODS In a longitudinal study, infants were followed from birth up to 12 months. Nasopharyngeal specimens were collected monthly (months 1-6 and month 9) and during an upper respiratory infection. Rhinoviruses were detected by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Presence of repeated rhinovirus RNA was evaluated by nucleotide sequence analysis. RESULTS A total of 2153 specimens from 362 infants were studied; 341 distinct rhinovirus infections in 216 infants were identified. Follow-up specimens were available within 30 days for 179 infections, creating the sample set to assess prolonged rhinovirus presence. Of the 179 infections, 46 involved the detection of the same rhinovirus strain in repeated specimens, including 8 events of prolonged presence of the same strain (detected in specimens collected >30 days apart), representing 4.5% of the evaluable rhinovirus infections. There were 26 events in which a rhinovirus strain was replaced by a different strain within a 30-day interval, representing 14.5% of the 179 infections. CONCLUSIONS Although rhinovirus infections are common in healthy infants, prolonged presence of rhinovirus RNA in the respiratory tract after an upper respiratory infection was uncommon (<5%). Detection of rhinovirus RNA in an infant most likely represents an infection within a 30-day period.","Loeffelholz, Michael J; Trujillo, Rocio; Pyles, Richard B; Miller, Aaron L; Alvarez-Fernandez, Pedro; Pong, Dan L; Chonmaitree, Tasnee",Pediatrics,96,23

However, little is known about the virus-host interaction of COVID-19 in sperm cells. We are the first to address the connection between changes in multiple seminal biomarkers and reproductive function in male patients recovering from COVID-19. METHODS In a prospective longitudinal cohort study, seminal ACE2 activity, markers of inflammation and oxidative stress, apoptotic variables, and semen quality parameters were evaluated at 10-day intervals for a maximum follow-up time of 60 days among male patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 (n=84) and healthy controls (CON; n=105). FINDINGS At the baseline and the subsequent follow-ups, the COVID-19 group revealed significantly higher levels of seminal plasma ACE2 enzymatic activity, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TGF-β, TNF-α, IFN-α, IFN-γ, ROS, caspase-8, caspase-9, and caspase-3 activity as well as lower levels of SOD activity than those in the CON group (P<0.05). These perturbations tended to persist over time and were correlated with significant impairments in semen volume, progressive motility, sperm morphology, sperm concentration, and the number of spermatozoa. INTERPRETATION We provide the direct experimental evidence that the male reproductive system could be targeted and damaged by the COVID-19 infection. These findings go beyond our current understanding of the disease, suggesting that the reproductive function of the patients recovering from the disease should be precisely followed and evaluated to detect and avoid more serious reproductive problems in the future, since they may develop a transient state of male subfertility like those with oligoasthenoteratozoospermia.","Hajizadeh Maleki, Behzad; Tartibian, Bakhtyar",Reproduction,96,1

Excessive cuff pressure presents a risk of tracheal damage and stenosis. Insufficient cuff pressure adds the risk of secretion leak past the cuff, tidal-volume leakage, and accidental extubation. The available cuff-inflation devices do not address these problems. OBJECTIVE In the laboratory I developed and evaluated a new cuff-inflation device that continuously displays the cuff pressure and maintains stable cuff pressure. METHODS The cuff-inflation device evaluation included: test the manometer accuracy; compare the displayed pressure to the pressure delivered to the pilot balloon; determine the device's response to cuff-pressure changes with the addition of 5 mL or 10 mL of air after achieving a 30 cm H(2)O baseline; measure the V(T) leak in an intubated artificial trachea by comparing the device results to benchmark measurements; and determine the stability of baseline cuff pressure during routine cuff checks. RESULTS The mean ± SD bias and precision of device's display, compared to the calibration analyzer, was 1.3 ± 2.6 cm H(2)O. The pressure delivered by the cuff-inflation device's gas-sampling line to the pilot balloon was equal to the pressure displayed by the cuff-inflation device. With the cuff-inflation device the cuff pressure was unchanged, compared to baseline, after adding 5 mL or 10 mL of air. With 2 current cuff methods, cuff pressure increased to means exceeding 160 cm H(2)O and 300 cm H(2)O, respectively. Compared to the benchmark, the difference in exhaled V(T) mean ± SD bias and precision were: cuff-inflation device 1.4 ± 4.8 mL, and syringe-inflation method 2.4 ± 6.2 mL. Representing a single cuff pressure check, disconnecting the endotracheal-tube pilot balloon from the cuff-inflation device's gas-sampling line and then reconnecting it had no effect on baseline cuff pressure at 2 seconds or 60 seconds. CONCLUSIONS The cuff-inflation device demonstrated possible improvements over available cuff-inflation devices and cuff-pressure-control methods.","Howard, William R",Respiratory care,96,1

Many patients can be successfully weaned, the ability of some medications to facilitate weaning from veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation were reported. To date, there are limited studies investigating the impact of levosimendan on veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation weaning. The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess the effects of levosimendan on successful weaning from veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and survival in adult patients with cardiogenic shock. METHODS We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis (PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform published from the year 2000 onwards) investigating whether levosimendan offers advantages compared to standard therapy or placebo, in cardiogenic shock adult patients treated with veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The primary outcome was veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation successful weaning, whereas secondary outcome was all-cause mortality at the longest follow-up available. We pooled risk ratio and 95% confidence interval using fixed and random effects models according to the heterogeneity. RESULTS A total of five non-randomized clinical trials comprising 557 patients were included, 299 patients for levosimendan and 258 patients for control groups. The pooled prevalence of veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation successful weaning was 61.4% (95% confidence interval 39.8-82.9%), and all-cause mortality was 36% (95% confidence interval 29.6-48.8%). There was a significant increase in veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation successful weaning with levosimendan compared to the controls (risk ratio = 1.42 (95% confidence interval 1.12-1.8), p for effect = 0.004, I2 = 71%). A decrease risk of all-cause mortality in the levosimendan group was also observed, risk ratio = 0.62 (95% confidence interval 0.44-0.88), p for effect = 0.007, I2 = 36%. CONCLUSION The use of levosimendan on adult patients with cardiogenic shock may facilitate the veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation weaning and reduce all-cause mortality. Few articles of this topic are available, and prospective, randomized multi-center trials are warranted to conclude decisively on the benefits of levosimendan in this setting.","Burgos, Lucrecia María; Seoane, Leonardo; Furmento, Juan Francisco; Costabel, Juan Pablo; Diez, Mirta; Vrancic, Mariano; Aissaoui, Nadia; Benzadón, Mariano Noel; Navia, Daniel",Perfusion,96,13

The use of prevascularized models built from dedicated materials could solve some of the actual limitations, such as suboptimal integration of the bioconstructs within the host tissue, and would provide more in vivo-like perfusable tissue and organ-specific platforms. In the last decade, the fabrication of vascularized physiologically relevant 3D constructs has been attempted by numerous tissue engineering strategies, which are classified here in microfluidic technology, 3D coculture models, namely, spheroids and organoids, and biofabrication. In this review, the recent advancements in prevascularization techniques and the increasing use of natural and synthetic materials to build physiological organ-specific models are discussed. Current drawbacks of each technology, future perspectives, and translation of vascularized tissue constructs toward clinics, pharmaceutical field, and industry are also presented. By combining complementary strategies, these models are envisioned to be successfully used for regenerative medicine and drug development in a near future.","Dellaquila, Alessandra; Le Bao, Chau; Letourneur, Didier; Simon-Yarza, Teresa",Advanced science,96,12

However, the cellular mechanisms causing these deformities have not been elucidated. METHODS Silicone 2.7-Fr catheters were placed via the right external jugular vein of 16 rats with the cutdown method. After fixation with formalin at scheduled intervals (1week, 2weeks, 4weeks, and 8weeks; 4 rats in each group), the vein segment with the catheter in situ was harvested. Histological changes in the vein wall were studied and serially compared with light microscopy; standard hematoxylin-eosin staining, Masson's trichrome staining, van Gieson's elastin stain, and immunohistochemical stain against α-actin. RESULTS Pericatheter sleeve formation, circumferential smooth muscle cell proliferation and infiltration into the pericatheter sleeve by direct contact were noted in all 4 rats of 1-week model; this indicated the initiation of neointimal hyperplasia. The neointimal hyperplasia was located inside the elastin layer. At 2weeks, the SMCs stained faintly but the components of the vein wall were largely replaced by collagen. The proliferation and infiltration of SMCs stabilized at 4weeks and no SMCs were stained around the catheter. At 8weeks, luminal narrowing was noted and the venous wall was composed mainly of collagen. CONCLUSIONS Circumferential neointimal hyperplasia occurred after surgical cutdown of the external jugular vein in a rat model and was caused by SMC activation, proliferation, and infiltration into the pericatheter sleeve.","Kim, Seongyup; Kim, Younglim; Moon, Suk-Bae",Journal of pediatric surgery,96,1

Thus, investigating predictors of falls in patients waiting for THA would be valuable as it lead to more strategic interventions to prevent these problems. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the predictors of falls in patients during the first year after THA. Methods This is a prospective cohort study. A total of 157 patients who underwent THA for unilateral hip osteoarthritis were analyzed. The incidence of falls during the first year after THA was monitored, and patients were classified into a ""faller"" and ""non-faller"" group. The following factors were compared between the two groups: demographic data (age, sex, body mass index, leg length discrepancy, length of hospital stay, and history of falling), preoperative hip abductor muscle strength, functional performance (single leg stance and maximum walking speed), pain during walking, and physical activity. Results On multivariate logistic regression analysis, preoperative hip abductor muscle strength on the affected side and a history of falling were predictors of falls during the first year after THA. On subsequent receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, preoperative hip abductor muscle strength on the affected side was retained as a significant predictor, with a cut-off strength of 0.46 Nm/kg differentiating the faller and non-faller groups with a specificity of 73.6%, specificity of 50.0%, and area under the curve of 70.2%. Conclusions Finding from the present study suggested that clinicians should focus on low preoperative hip abductor muscle strength on the affected side and a history of falling to prevent falls during the first year after THA.","Ninomiya, Kazunari; Takahira, Naonobu; Ikeda, Takashi; Suzuki, Koji; Sato, Ryoji; Hirakawa, Kazuo",Health science reports,96,19
76298,76298,76298,The evolutionary state of electrosurgery: where are we now?,14.422985,8.076292,2008,"New approaches to rapid, simple, in vitro diagnostic immunoassays that do not rely on centralized laboratory facilities are urgently needed for disease diagnosis and to inform treatment strategies. The recent and ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has emphasized that rapid diagnostics are needed to help guide government policies on quarantines, social distancing measures, and community lockdowns. A common approach to developing new immunoassays is to modify existing platforms (e.g., automated ELISA and lateral flow assays) for the new analyte, even though this does not address the drawbacks of existing platforms. An alternate approach is to search for robust assays that have been superseded but could in fact solve important challenges using modern technologies. Immunodiffusion is one such platform based on unique ""precipitin ring"" patterns formed in gels or paper following interactions between proteins and cognate antibodies in diffusion/reaction systems. Herein, we investigate the microstructure of these precipitin rings using a combination of fluorescence and electron microscopy and also perform a mass spectrometry investigation to determine the proteomic composition of the rings. We observed that the rings were composed of microparticles, which we termed ""precipitin complexes"", and that these complexes were composed of at least 19 key proteins, including immunoglobulins and complement factors along with a range of plasma proteins, possibly related to immune complexes and/or high-density lipoprotein particles. This information will be useful in developing new in vitro diagnostics using reaction/diffusion systems-techniques that require a single assay step and that only require calibrated length measurements for target protein quantification.","Jayawardena, Imanda; Wilson, Kirsty; Plebanski, Magdalena; Grøndahl, Lisbeth; Corrie, Simon",Journal of proteome research,96,24

It is also thought that MBL plays a role in the recruitment of the specific clonal immune response. This was studied by injecting soluble hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) intravenously into mice deficient in both MBL-A and MBL-C (MBL DKO mice). The MBL DKO animals on mixed genetic background (SV129EvSv x C57BL/6) produced higher antibody titres than the wild-type littermates. After primary challenge with the antigen the immunoglobulin M anti-HBsAg antibody titres were threefold higher in the MBL DKO mice than in the wild-type mice. Following the boost, the immunoglobulin G anti-HBsAg antibody titres were 10-fold higher in the MBL DKO mice, suggesting that MBL plays a role in a negative feedback regulation of adaptive immunity. However, the modulating effect of MBL was dependent on the genetic environment. The MBL DKO mice backcrossed on a C57BL/6 background showed the opposite response with the MBL DKO mice now producing fewer antibodies than the wild-type animals, whereas MBL deficiency in mice with the SV129EvSv background did not show any effect in antibody production. These findings indicate that the modifying effect of MBL on the humoral immune response is influenced by the genetic environment.","Ruseva, Marieta; Kolev, Martin; Dagnaes-Hansen, Frederik; Hansen, Soren B; Takahashi, Kazue; Ezekowitz, Alan; Thiel, Steffen; Jensenius, Jens C; Gadjeva, Mihaela",Immunology,96,1

We performed a systematic literature search in December 2015 (updated in December 2016). We included randomised, controlled and cluster-randomised trials of women in labour with planned vaginal delivery receiving patient-controlled remifentanil compared principally with other parenteral and patient-controlled opioids, epidural analgesia and continuous remifentanil infusion or placebo. The primary outcomes were patient satisfaction with pain relief and the occurrence of adverse events for mothers and newborns. We assessed risk of bias for each included study and applied the GRADE approach for the quality of evidence. We included total zero event trials, using a constant continuity correction of 0.01 and a random-effect meta-analysis. Twenty studies were included in the qualitative analysis; within these, 3713 participants were randomised and 3569 analysed. Most of our pre-specified outcomes were not studied in the included trials. However, we found evidence that women using patient-controlled remifentanil were more satisfied with pain relief than women receiving parenteral opioids (four trials, 216 patients, very low quality evidence) with a standardised mean difference ([SMD] 95%CI) of 2.11 (0.72-3.49), but were less satisfied than women receiving epidural analgesia (seven trials, 2135 patients, very low quality evidence), -0.22 (-0.40 to -0.04). Data on adverse events were sparse. However, the relative risk (95%CI) for maternal respiratory depression for patient-controlled remifentanil compared with epidural analgesia (three trials, 687 patients, low-quality evidence) was 0.91 (0.51-1.62). Compared with continuous intravenous infusion of remifentanil (two trials, 135 patients, low-quality evidence) no conclusion could be reached as all study arms showed zero events. The relative risk (95%CI) of Apgar scores less than 7 at 5 min after birth compared with epidural analgesia (five trials, 1322 participants, low-quality evidence) was 1.26 (0.62-2.57).","Jelting, Y; Weibel, S; Afshari, A; Pace, N L; Jokinen, J; Artmann, T; Eberhart, L H J; Kranke, P",Anaesthesia,96,28

The effects that survivors experience have been reported but rarely from the point of view of the survivors regarding their life after treatment. OBJECTIVE To examine the perceived late effects of pediatric cancer on survivors and their self-identified primary support persons in order to understand the multifaceted nature of living after a pediatric cancer diagnosis. METHODS Using a pragmatic interpretive phenomenology approach, 10 survivors of pediatric cancer (aged 21-28 years) and 9 of their support persons (aged 23-73 years) participated, completing background questionnaires and semistructured, one-on-one interviews. Interview transcripts were analyzed thematically. RESULTS Both survivors and support persons acknowledged that survivors experienced negative physical and cognitive health outcomes that require follow-up care. Survivors acknowledged that their cancer experience and residual effects have changed the trajectory of their lives. CONCLUSIONS Research on young adult survivors of pediatric cancer and the residual/late effects and emotional outcomes they experience is warranted. Longitudinal research can aid in understanding how effects develop or worsen over time. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE The findings of this study support The Children's Oncology Group Long-term Follow-up Guidelines for practitioners.

To determine the relationships among photosynthesis, ROS, and defence responses to powdery mildew in wheat, we compared the responses of the Pm40-expressing wheat line L658 and its susceptible sister line L958 at 0, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h post-inoculation (hpi) with powdery mildew via analyses of transcriptomes, cytology, antioxidant activities, photosynthesis, and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters. The results showed that H2O2 accumulation in L658 was significantly greater than that in L958 at 6 and 48 hpi, and the enzymes activity and transcripts expression of peroxidase and catalase were suppressed in L658 compared with L958. In addition, the inhibition of photosynthesis in L658 paralleled the global downregulation of photosynthesis-related genes. Furthermore, the expression of the salicylic acid-related genes non-expressor of pathogenesis related genes 1 (NPR1), pathogenesis-related 1 (PR1), and pathogenesis-related 5 (PR5) was upregulated, while the expression of jasmonic acid- and ethylene-related genes was inhibited in L658 compared with L958. In conclusion, the downregulation of photosynthesis-related genes likely led to a decline in photosynthesis, which may be combined with the inhibition of peroxidase (POD) and catalase (CAT) to generate two stages of H2O2 accumulation. The high level of H2O2, salicylic acid and PR1 and PR5 in L658 possible initiated the hypersensitive response.","Hu, Yuting; Zhong, Shengfu; Zhang, Min; Liang, Yinping; Gong, Guoshu; Chang, Xiaoli; Tan, Feiquan; Yang, Huai; Qiu, Xiaoyan; Luo, Liya; Luo, Peigao",International journal of molecular sciences,96,1

To overcome this problem, barbed self-retaining sutures have been effectively employed in various minimally invasive endourologic surgeries. However, the use of this suture has been recently cautioned for pyeloplasty due to a high failure rate. Our objective was to report our experience using barbed suture during robotic pyeloplasty. METHODS We retrospectively identified 13 consecutive patients who underwent robotic pyeloplasty with a barbed monofilament (4-0 V-Loc™) suture for the ureteropelvic anastomosis from 2011 to 2014. We compared these patients to 12 consecutive patients who underwent robotic pyeloplasty with a 4-0 nonbarbed suture from 2007 to 2011. We evaluated patient demographics, operative times, preoperative and postoperative symptoms, renal function, and diuretic renograms (DRG). Successful repair was defined as resolution of preoperative symptoms and/or T½ improvement on DRG to less than 20 minutes. RESULTS The median age was 26 (interquartile range [IQR] 20.7-38) years and 35 (IQR 18.3-44) years for the barbed and nonbarbed suture groups, respectively. In the barbed suture group, preoperative DRG revealed ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO) in 11 patients, equivocal UPJO (T½ 10-20 minutes) in one patient, and no obstruction in one patient. In the nonbarbed group, preoperative DRG revealed UPJO in 10 patients, equivocal UPJO in one patient, and no obstruction in one patient. In the barbed suture group, postoperative DRG was obtained in 11 patients, which showed no obstruction in 10/11 patients with 92% of patients experiencing symptom resolution. Similarly, postoperative DRG was obtained in 11 patients in the nonbarbed group, which showed no obstruction in 10/11 patients with 100% postoperative symptom resolution. CONCLUSIONS In the largest series reporting use of V-Loc suture for robotic pyeloplasty, the V-Loc suture was safely and effectively used for robotic pyeloplasty repair.","Sorokin, Igor; O'Malley, Rebecca L; McCandless, Brian K; Kaufman, Ronald P",Journal of endourology,96,19

METHODS All cases of pelvic exenterations, for all malignancies, performed at Moffitt Cancer Center from 1999 to 2008, were identified through retrospective review of medical records. Estimated blood loss (EBL), transfusion, operative time, hospital stay, and complications were compared between Ligasure cases and non-Ligasure cases. RESULTS Seventy-five patients underwent identified. Ligasure was used in 29/75 (39%) cases and standard techniques in 46/75 (61%) cases. Primary malignancy was gynecologic in 31/75(40%) cases (18/29, 62% Ligasure cases, 13/46, 26% non-Ligasure cases). Patients undergoing gynecologic exenteration received fewer intraoperative packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusions in the Ligasure group (mean = 2.8 U), compared to the non-Ligasure group (mean = 3.8 U; P < 0.0001). The EBL was less for Ligasure cases (1,815 ml vs. 2,205 ml; P = 0.4). For all patients, Ligasure cases had lower mean transfusion (2.7 U vs. 3.2 U; P = 0.32), and EBL (1,662 ml vs. 1,843 ml; P = 0.5). The mean operating time was similar (492 min vs. 502 min). There were no cases of re-operation for hemorrhage in either group. CONCLUSIONS Use of electrothermal bipolar coagulation for gynecologic exenterative surgery is associated with significantly lower blood transfusions, and may decrease blood loss and transfusion in non-gynecologic exenterative surgery.","Bansal, Nisha; Roberts, William S; Apte, Sachin M; Lancaster, Johnathan M; Wenham, Robert M",Journal of surgical oncology,96,31

MATERIALS AND METHODS Data were retrospectively collected from 366 consecutive transplants performed between January 2013 and January 2015 in our hospital, in which an external ureteral stent was placed during surgery and removed after 9 days. Urological complications were defined as urinary leakage or ureteral stenosis requiring percutaneous nephrostomy placement. RESULTS A total of 197 patients received a straight stent with 2 larger side holes (type A; 8F ""Covidien"" tube; Covidien, Dublin, Ireland) and 169 patients received a single J stent with 7 smaller side holes (type B; 7F ""Teleflex"" single J stent; Teleflex Medical, Athlone, Ireland). We found a significantly higher number of percutaneous nephrostomy placements with type A stents, with 34 (17%) versus 16 (9%) in type B (P = .030). Reason for percutaneous nephrostomy placement, occurrence of stent dysfunction, and need for early removal (< 8 days) were equal in both groups (P = .397), whereas incidence of rejection and urinary tract infection were higher in type B stent group. Patient and graft survival did not differ between the groups. CONCLUSIONS Use of the type B stent was associated with less urological complications compared with the type A stent.","Ooms, Liselotte S S; Spaans, Laura G; Betjes, Michiel G H; Ijzermans, Jan N M; Terkivatan, Türkan",Experimental and clinical transplantation : official journal of the Middle East Society for Organ Transplantation,96,29

The current literature suggests that there are no specific histopathological characteristics in the placenta related to SARS-CoV-2 infection, but placentas from infected women are more likely to show findings of maternal and/or fetal malperfusion. The most common findings in placentas from infected women were fibrin deposition and intense recruitment of inflammatory infiltrates. The transplacental transmission of this virus is unlikely to occur, probably due to low expression of the receptor for SARS-CoV-2 in placental cell types.

Secondary outcomes included length of procedure, incidence of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, 90-day mortality, and radiographic analysis of percentage area salvage. RESULTS Compared with the Merci/Penumbra group, the Solitaire group showed a statistically significant improvement in favorable outcomes (mRS ≤ 2) (69% versus 35%, P = 0.03) and symptomatic ICH rate (0 versus 15%, P = 0.05) with a trend towards higher recanalization rates (93.5% versus 75%, P = 0.096) and shorter length of procedure (58.5 min versus 70.8 min, P = 0.08). Radiographic comparison also showed a significantly larger area of salvage in the Solitaire group (81.9% versus 71.9%, P = 0.05). CONCLUSION Our study suggests that the Solitaire system allows faster, safer, and more efficient thrombectomy than Merci or Penumbra systems.","Hann, Shannon; Chalouhi, Nohra; Starke, Robert; Gandhe, Ashish; Koltz, Michael; Theofanis, Thana; Jabbour, Pascal; Gonzalez, L Fernando; Rosenwasser, Robert; Tjoumakaris, Stavropoula",BioMed research international,96,12

The high sensitivity of these tests affects our understanding of the epidemiology of respiratory tract infections. We have assessed the detection rate of a multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, with emphasis on epidemiology and seasonal distribution of the most common respiratory tract infections. METHODS Seven thousand eight hundred and fifty-three nasopharyngeal samples from 7220 patients (age range 0-98 y, median 22 y) obtained during 36 consecutive months (November 2006-October 2009), were analyzed with a multiplex PCR panel including influenza A (IfA) and B (IfB) virus, parainfluenza virus (PIV) 1-3, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human rhinovirus (HRV), human coronavirus (CoV) OC43, NL63, and 229E, human metapneumovirus (HMPV), adenovirus (AdV), enterovirus (EV), and 2 bacteria--Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae. RESULTS Of the total samples, 44.5% (n = 3496) were positive for at least 1 agent, with HRV being the most common (n = 1482, 38.0%), followed by RSV (n = 526, 13.5%) and IfA (n = 403, 10.3%). The diagnostic yield was significantly higher during the winter and early spring compared to the summer (n = 2439 of 4458 samples, 54.7% and n = 1057 of 3395 samples, 31.1%, respectively; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS The diagnostic yield was highly dependent on the month of sampling and the age of the patient. However, the overall detection rate per month was above 30%, apart for August and September. Our findings support the use of similar tests in routine clinical care all year round. HRV was the most common finding in the respiratory tract, independent of season.","Brittain-Long, Robin; Andersson, Lars-Magnus; Olofsson, Sigvard; Lindh, Magnus; Westin, Johan",Scandinavian journal of infectious diseases,96,1

This study examined the associations among BDNF Val66Met polymorphisms, menstrual pain severity, and hippocampal volume among young PDM subjects. We recruited 115 PDM subjects, including severe cases (n = 66) and moderate cases (n = 44), and 117 young females (aged 20-30 years) as a control group (CON) for BDNF Val66Met genotyping and MRI examination. The assessment of hippocampal volume involved analysis at various anatomical resolutions, i.e., whole hippocampal volume, hippocampal subfields, and voxel-based morphometry (VBM) volumetric analysis. Two-way ANOVA analyses with planned contrasts and Bonferroni correction were conducted for the assessment of hippocampal volume. Linear regression was used to test for BDNF Val66Met Val allele dosage-dependent effects. We observed no main effects of group, genotype, or group-genotype interactions on bilateral whole hippocampal volumes. Significant interactions between PDM severity and BDNF Val66Met genotype were observed in the right whole hippocampus, subiculum, and molecular layer. Post-hoc analysis revealed that the average hippocampal volume of Val/Val moderate PDM subjects was greater than that of Val/Val severe PDM subjects. Note that right hippocampal volume was greater in the Val/Val group than in the Met/Met group, particularly in the right posterior hippocampal region. Dosage effect analysis revealed a positive dosage-dependent relationship between the Val allele and volume of the right whole hippocampus, subiculum, molecular layer, and VBM-defined right posterior hippocampal region in the moderate PDM subgroup only. These findings indicate that Val/Val PDM subjects are resistant to intermittent moderate pain-related stress, whereas Met carrier PDM subjects are susceptible. When confronted with years of repeated PDM stress, the hippocampus can undergo differential structural changes in accordance with the BDNF genotype and pain severity. This triad study on PDM (i.e., combining genotype with endophenotype imaging results and clinical phenotypes), underscores the potential neurobiological consequences of PDM, which may prefigure in neuroimaging abnormalities associated with various chronic pain disorders. Our results provide evidence for Val allele dosage-dependent protective effects on the hippocampal structure; however, in cases of the Val variant, these effects were modulated in accordance with the severity of menstrual pain.","Li, Wei-Chi; Chao, Hsiang-Tai; Lin, Ming-Wei; Shen, Horng-Der; Chen, Li-Fen; Hsieh, Jen-Chuen",NeuroImage.

Early and accurate identification of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is fundamental to combat the disease. Among the current diagnostic tests, real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is the most reliable and frequently used method. Herein, we discuss the interpretation of RT-qPCR results relative to viral infectivity. Although nasopharyngeal swab samples are often used for RT-qPCR testing, they require collection by trained medical staff. Saliva samples are emerging as an inexpensive and efficient alternative for large-scale screening. Pooled-sample testing of saliva has been applied for mass screening of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Current policies recommend isolating people with borderline cycle threshold (Ct) values (35<Ct <40), despite these Ct values indicating minimal infection risk. We propose the new concept of a ""social cut-off"" Ct value and risk stratification based on the correlation of Ct with infectivity. We also describe the experience of RT-qPCR screening of saliva samples at our institution. It is important to implement a scientific approach to minimize viral transmission while allowing economic and social activities to continue.","Oba, Junna; Taniguchi, Hiroaki; Sato, Masae; Takamatsu, Reika; Morikawa, Satoru; Nakagawa, Taneaki; Takaishi, Hiromasa; Saya, Hideyuki; Matsuo, Koichi; Nishihara, Hiroshi",The Keio journal of medicine,96,28

Viral genetic diversity is created by the ribonucleotide misincorporation frequency of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). We have identified a poliovirus (PV) RdRp derivative (H273R) possessing a mutator phenotype. GMP misincorporation efficiency for H273R RdRp in vitro was increased by 2-3-fold that manifested in a 2-3-fold increase in the diversity of the H273R PV population in cells. Circular sequencing analysis indicated that some mutations were RdRp-independent. Consistent with the population genetics theory, H273R PV was driven to extinction more easily than WT in cell culture. Furthermore, we observed a substantial reduction in H273R PV virulence, measured as the ability to cause paralysis in the cPVR mouse model. Reduced virulence correlated with the inability of H273R PV to sustain replication in tissues/organs in which WT persists. Despite the attenuated phenotype, H273R PV was capable of replicating in mice to levels sufficient to induce a protective immune response, even when the infecting dose used was insufficient to elicit any visual signs of infection. We conclude that optimal RdRp fidelity is a virulence determinant that can be targeted for viral attenuation or antiviral therapies, and we suggest that the RdRp may not be the only source of mutations in a RNA virus genome.","Korboukh, Victoria K; Lee, Cheri A; Acevedo, Ashley; Vignuzzi, Marco; Xiao, Yinghong; Arnold, Jamie J; Hemperly, Stephen; Graci, Jason D; August, Avery; Andino, Raul; Cameron, Craig E",The Journal of biological chemistry,96,1

Additively manufactured patient-specific titanium implants provide unlimited options in design. However, implant malpositioning can still occur, even when intraoperative imaging and navigation are used. In this study, we investigated novel orbital implants containing features facilitating self-centering. Accuracy of implant placement and reconstruction of the orbital dimensions were compared retrospectively between self-centering second-generation patient-specific functionalized orbital implants (study group) and CAD-based individualized implants (control group). Design features of implants in the study group included functionalization with navigation tracks, a preventive design, and flanges - so called stabilizers - towards opposite orbital walls. Implant position was evaluated by fusion of preoperative virtual plans and the post-therapeutic imaging. Aberrances were quantified by 3D heatmap analysis. 31 patients were assigned to the study group and 50 to the control group, respectively. In the study group, most implants were designed with either one (n = 18, 58.06%) or two (n = 10, 32.26%) stabilizers. Twice (6.45%), one stabilizer had to be shortened intraoperatively. Implant fit analysis revealed a significantly more precise (p < 0.001) positioning in the study group (n = 22/31) than in the control group (n = 42/50). Self-centering second-generation patient-specific functionalized orbital implants showed significantly more accurate implant positioning, facilitating the transformation of virtual plans into patient's anatomy. The presented design provides an additional instrument for intraoperative quality control besides intraoperative imaging and navigation.","Zeller, Alexander-Nicolai; Neuhaus, Michael Tobias; Gessler, Nora; Skade, Sandra; Korn, Philippe; Jehn, Philipp; Gellrich, Nils-Claudius; Zimmerer, Rüdiger M","Journal of stomatology, oral and maxillofacial surgery",96,28

Identification by MS/MS reveals these putative biomarkers to be byproducts of the coagulation cascade and platelet activation and suggests plasmatic analysis may be preferred. In a pilot plasmatic study, a cohort of naïve prostate cancer (PCa) samples were uniformly distinguished from their age-matched controls (n = 20) on the basis of multiple peptidic components; most notably by a derivative of complement C(4) at 1863 m/z (GLEEELQFSLGSKINVK, C4(1353-1369) ). The fully tryptic nature of this and other putative PCa discriminants is consistent with the cleavage specificity of common blood proteases and questions the need for tumor-derived proteolytic activities as has been proposed. In light of the known correlation of disregulated hemostasis with malignant disease, we suggest the underlying differentiating phenomena in these types of analyses may lie in the temporal disparity of sample activation such that the case (patient) samples are preactivated while the control samples are not.","Davis, Michael T; Auger, Paul; Spahr, Chris; Patterson, Scott D",Proteomics.

BACKGROUND The optimal stenting strategy following the subintimal recanalization of long femoropopliteal chronic total occlusions has not been investigated. METHODS A total of 196 limbs in 163 patients, implanted with bare nitinol stents after subintimal approach in long femoropopliteal occlusions (lesion length 25 ± 8 cm), were retrospectively analyzed. The primary patency was compared between spot stenting (n = 129) and long stenting (n = 67). RESULTS Baseline characteristics and immediate procedural results were similar between groups. Adjusted-primary patency (47% vs. 77%, p < 0.001) and adjusted-freedom from target lesion revascularization (52% vs. 84%, p < 0.001) at 2 years were significantly lower in the long stenting group than in the spot stenting group. The incidence of stent fracture, fracture type, and restenosis pattern did not differ between groups. Long stenting was an independent predictor of restenosis (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.0) along with other risk factors such as nonuse of clopidogrel (HR: 3.3) or cilostazol (HR: 2.2), small stent diameter (HR: 0.6), poor run-off (HR: 1.9), and post-procedural ankle-brachial index (HR: 0.1). Compared with spot stenting after adjustment using inverse probability of treatment weighting, long stenting, especially involving the P2 or P3 segment of the popliteal artery, was independently associated with 7.5-fold increases in restenosis risk (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS The primary patency was significantly higher with spot stenting than with long stenting following subintimal approach for long femoropopliteal chronic total occlusions. The risk of restenosis was especially higher when long stenting was extended to the distal popliteal artery.","Hong, Sung-Jin; Ko, Young-Guk; Shin, Dong-Ho; Kim, Jung-Sun; Kim, Byeong-Keuk; Choi, Donghoon; Hong, Myeong-Ki; Jang, Yangsoo",JACC.

In an effort to improve outcomes, many have called for facilitating early detection of cognitive decline. Increased use of mobile technology by older adults provides the opportunity to deliver convenient, cost-effective assessments for earlier detection of cognitive impairment. This article presents a review of the literature on how mobile platforms-smartphones and tablets-are being used for cognitive assessment of older adults along with benefits and opportunities associated with using mobile platforms for cognitive assessment. Research Design and Methods We searched MEDLINE, Web of Science, PsycInfo, CINAHL, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials in October 2018. This search returned 7,024 articles. After removing 1,464 duplicates, we screened titles and abstracts then screened full-text for those articles meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria. Results Twenty-nine articles met our inclusion criteria and were categorized into 3 groups as follows: (a) mobile versions of existing article or computerized neuropsychological tests; (b) new cognitive tests developed specifically for mobile platforms; and (c) the use of new types of data for cognitive assessment. This scoping review confirms the considerable potential of mobile assessment. Discussion and Implications Mobile technologies facilitate repeated and continuous assessment and support unobtrusive collection of auxiliary behavioral markers of cognitive impairment, thus allowing users to view trends and detect acute changes that have traditionally been difficult to identify. Opportunities include using new mobile sensors and wearable devices, improving reliability and validity of mobile assessments, determining appropriate clinical use of mobile assessment information, and incorporating person-centered assessment principles and digital phenotyping.","Koo, Bon Mi; Vizer, Lisa M",Innovation in aging,96,4

However, adsorption of polar functionalities can be induced rapidly by annealing in a polar environment such as glycerol prior to quenching to a glassy state. Blended films of carboxy end-functionalised deuteriopolystyrene (dPS-COOH) with hydrogenous polystyrene (hPS) were annealed at 150 °C under glycerol. Nuclear reaction analysis was used to quantify the surface excess of dPS-COOH retained at the surface after quenching the films to below the glass transition temperature. Incorporation of multiple COOH groups onto a single chain end greatly increases the affinity of these chains to the interface with glycerol. Here we have shown that even a difunctional material, dPS-2COOH, is much more surface active than either the singly functionalised dPS-COOH or the difunctional ester from which it was prepared. Self-consistent mean field theory yielded thermodynamic 'sticking energy' values per functionality at the polystyrene-glycerol surface of 1.3-1.7 for carboxy groups and 0.3 for ester groups.","Narrainen, Amilcar Pillay; Clarke, Nigel; Eggleston, Stuart M; Hutchings, Lian R; Thompson, Richard L",Soft matter,96,20

Ten years following the release of the first app targeting problematic tobacco, alcohol, and illicit drug use, their effectiveness, use, and acceptability remains unclear. OBJECTIVE This study aims to conduct a systematic literature review of trials evaluating mobile app interventions for problematic tobacco, alcohol, and illicit drug use. METHODS The review was conducted according to recommended guidelines. Relevant databases were searched, and articles were included if the mobile app study was a controlled intervention trial and reported alcohol, tobacco, or illicit drug consumption as outcomes. RESULTS A total of 20 studies met eligibility criteria across a range of substances: alcohol (n=11), tobacco (n=6), alcohol and tobacco (n=1), illicit drugs (n=1), and illicit drugs and alcohol (n=1). Samples included the general community, university students, and clinical patients. The analyzed intervention sample sizes ranged from 22 to 14,228, and content was considerably diverse, from simple stand-alone apps delivering self-monitoring or psychoeducation to multicomponent apps with interactive features and audio content, or used as adjuncts alongside face-to-face treatment. Intervention duration ranged from 1 to 35 weeks, with notifications ranging from none to multiple times per day. A total of 6 of the 20 app interventions reported significant reductions in substance use at post or follow-up compared with a comparison condition, with small to moderate effect sizes. Furthermore, two other app interventions reported significant reductions during the intervention but not at post treatment, and a third reported a significant interaction of two app intervention components. CONCLUSIONS Although most app interventions were associated with reductions in problematic substance use, less than one-third were significantly better than the comparison conditions at post treatment. A total of 5 out of the 6 apps that reported intervention effects targeted alcohol (of those, one targeted alcohol and illicit drugs and another alcohol and tobacco) and 1 targeted tobacco. Moreover, 3 out of 6 apps included feedback (eg, personalized) and 2 had high risk of bias, 1 some risk, and 3 low risk. All 6 apps included interventions of 6 weeks or longer. Common study limitations were small sample sizes; risk of bias; lack of relevant details; and, in some cases, poorly balanced comparison conditions. Appropriately powered trials are required to understand which app interventions are most effective, length of engagement required, and subgroups most likely to benefit. In sum, evidence to date for the effectiveness of apps targeting problematic substance use is not compelling, although the heterogeneous comparison conditions and trial designs across studies limit the ability to compare efficacy between apps. We discuss potential approaches that can help ascertain whether the promise of mobile app interventions for problematic substance use can be fulfilled.","Staiger, Petra Karin; O'Donnell, Renee; Liknaitzky, Paul; Bush, Rachel; Milward, Joanna",Journal of medical Internet research,96,1

METHODS A single-center observational study was performed in patients treated for squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx or hypopharynx by total (pharyngo)-laryngectomy between 2010 and 2015. Study data comprised: maximum phonation time (sec), number of and reasons for prosthesis exchanges (leakage through or around the prosthesis, expulsion or inclusion of the prosthesis), plus 2 quality of life questionnaires (QLQ-C30, QLQ-H&N35) and the Voice Handicap Inventory (VHI 30). RESULTS Forty-nine patients were included. The most common causes of prosthesis exchange were leakage through (73.2%) or around the prosthesis (18.5%). The median time between exchanges was 4 months. Global quality of life status on the QLQ-C30 was 63.5. Mean maximum phonation time was 7.4sec. Mean VHI was 46/120; 10 patients had a mild voice handicap, 12 moderate and 10 severe. No relation emerged between the number of prosthesis exchanges per year and quality of life. Voice handicap significantly decreased quality of life, with QLQ-C30 72.3 for the 22 patients with mild to moderate voice handicap and 44.2 for the 10 patients with severe voice handicap (P=0.001).

PD is a connective tissue disorder marked by fibrotic healing of the tunica albuginea, leading to penile deformities including curvature, shortening, loss of girth, hourglass appearance, and hinging. Despite the multiple medical therapies available, surgery is the gold standard of treatment once the plaque has stabilized. We present a review of the disease process, preoperative evaluation, operative planning, surgical treatments with outcomes and complications, and nascent developments in surgical management and graft development. Options include tunical lengthening procedures, tunical shortening procedures, and penile prosthesis. Decision-making is governed by degree of curvature, erectile function, and associated penile deformities. In cases with curvature of less than 60-70 degrees, adequate penile length, and no hourglass deformity, patients are candidates for tunical shortening procedures. Patients with curvature greater than 60-70 degrees, penile hourglass or hinge-destabilizing deformities, and adequate erectile function should be counseled with regard to tunical lengthening procedures. Patients with poor preoperative erectile function should undergo inflatable penile prosthesis placement, with possible secondary straightening procedures. Technique selection should be based upon surgeon preference, expertise, and experience, as evidence does not necessarily support one procedure over another.","Zaid, Uwais B; Alwaal, Amjad; Zhang, Xiaoyu; Lue, Tom F",Current urology reports,96,24

Older age at ITP diagnosis (odds ratio [OR]: 1.24, 95% CI: 1.07-1.45) and chronic ITP (OR: 24.67, 95% CI: 3.14-100.0) were independent risk factors. The cumulative probabilities of subsequently developing SLE at 5 and 10 years after diagnosis of ITP were 3.8% (95% CI: 1.4-6.2) and 6.5% (95% CI: 2.9-9.8), respectively. CONCLUSION Older age at ITP diagnosis and chronic ITP were risk factors for subsequent SLE developed in childhood ITP.","Kittivisuit, Sirinthip; Vachvanichsanong, Prayong; McNeil, Edward; Chotsampancharoen, Thirachit",Pediatric blood & cancer,96,1

However, cobalamin can be synthesized only by few microorganisms so most bacteria need to take it up from the environment through the TonB-dependent transport system. The first stage of cobalamin import to E. coli cells occurs through the outer-membrane receptor called BtuB. Vitamin B12 binds with high affinity to the extracellular side of the BtuB protein. BtuB forms a β-barrel with inner luminal domain and extracellular loops. To mechanically allow for cobalamin passage, the luminal domain needs to partially unfold with the help of the inner-membrane TonB protein. However, the mechanism of cobalamin permeation is unknown. Using all-atom molecular dynamics, we simulated the transport of cobalamin through the BtuB receptor embedded in an asymmetric and heterogeneous E. coli outer membrane. To enhance conformational sampling of the BtuB loops, we developed the Gaussian force-simulated annealing method (GF-SA) and coupled it with umbrella sampling. We found that cobalamin needs to rotate in order to permeate through BtuB. We showed that the mobility of BtuB extracellular loops is crucial for cobalamin binding and transport and resembles an induced fit mechanism. Loop mobility depends not only on the position of cobalamin but also on the extension of luminal domain. We provided atomistic details of cobalamin transport through the BtuB receptor showing the essential role of the mobility of BtuB extracellular loops. A similar TonB-dependent transport system is used also by many other compounds, such as haem and siderophores, and importantly, can be hijacked by natural antibiotics. Our work could have implications for future delivery of antibiotics to bacteria using this transport system.","Pieńko, Tomasz; Trylska, Joanna",PLoS computational biology,96,23

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA Single-port laparoscopic surgery maximizes the advantages of laparoscopic surgery, and therefore it can be an ultimate attainment of laparoscopic surgery. However, no comparative study has addressed its role in colorectal cancer. METHODS Prospectively collected data of patients who had undergone either conventional laparoscopic surgery (n = 106) or SPLS (n = 73) for colorectal cancer between March 2006 and May 2010 were analyzed retrospectively. The short-term outcomes of these 2 operative modalities were compared. RESULTS Of the 179 study subjects, 103 (57.5%) had colon cancer and 76 (42.5%) had rectal cancer. Various operative methods, from right hemicolectomy to abdominoperineal resection, were used according to location through either conventional laparoscopic or SPLS approach. In its comparison, mean surgical time was greater in the SPLS group (255 vs 276 minutes, P < 0.008). Acquired length of sufficient surgical margins and the number of harvested lymph nodes were comparable. Postoperative recovery was faster in the SPLS group, in terms of shorter time duration before first flatus (SPLS vs conventional laparoscopic surgery; 2.5 ± 1.2 vs 3.2 ± 1.8 days, P = 0.004), earlier initiation of free oral fluids (1.8 ± 2.2 vs 2.6 ± 1.7 days, P = 0.000) and of a solid diet (4.2 ± 2.9 vs 6.5 ± 2.7 days, P = 0.000), less frequent usage of parenteral narcotics (2.2 ± 3.2 vs 3.5 ± 4.0 times, P = 0.029), and shorter hospital stay (9.6 ± 9.6 vs 15.5 ± 9.8 days, P = 0.000). CONCLUSION This study shows that SPLS is both safe and feasible in colorectal cancer, and that it has equivalent or better short-term outcomes than conventional laparoscopic surgery. Accordingly, the authors conclude that SPLS can be an alternative to conventional laparoscopic surgery for colorectal cancer.","Kim, Say-June; Ryu, Gil-O; Choi, Byung-Jo; Kim, Jeong-Goo; Lee, Kwan-Ju; Lee, Sang Chul; Oh, Seong-Taek",Annals of surgery,96,6

METHODS We screened for RIAC and feeding hypoxemia among 393 infants with a gestational age ≥ 36 weeks using pulse oximetry. Twenty-seven infants were treated in the neonatal intensive care unit. RESULTS RIAC and feeding hypoxemia were observed in 95 (24.2%) and 124 (31.6%) infants, respectively. RIAC correlated with feeding hypoxemia (p < 0.001), grade II increased echogenicity in the ganglionic eminence (p = 0.005), dilation of the lateral ventricle (p = 0.044), threatened premature labor (p = 0.033) and twin gestation (p = 0.089). Feeding hypoxemia correlated with RIAC (p < 0.001), abnormal cranial ultrasound findings (p < 0.001), maternal smoking during pregnancy (p = 0.083), asymmetric intrauterine growth restriction (p = 0.012) and twin gestation (p = 0.067). All infants recovered from RIAC in an average of 4.5 (2.0-7.0) d. Fifteen infants recovered from feeding hypoxemia, but 10 infants needed additional assistance and monitoring by nursing until the day of discharge. The day of discharge was day 8.0 (5.0-12.4).

A total of 7,882 pig farms in the Red River Delta (RRD) region were obtained from the General Statistics Office, and then random points corresponding to the number of farms in each province were generated as exact farm locations were not available. A total of ten models were developed, including movement control scenarios. In addition, we conducted sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of indirect contact Transmission probability (TP). Overall, the indirect contact exhibited an important role in transmitting the ASF virus. In order to minimize ASF transmission between farms, we found that movement restriction needed to reach a certain level (approximately between 50% and 75%) and that the restriction had to be applied in a timely manner. This study offers valuable insight into how ASF virus can be transmitted via direct and indirect contact and controlled among farms under the various simulation scenarios. Our results suggest that the enforcement of movement restriction was an effective control measure as soon as the outbreaks were reported. In addition, this study provided evidence that high standards of biosecurity can contribute to the reduction of disease spread.","Lee, Hu Suk; Thakur, Krishna K; Bui, Vuong Nghia; Pham, Thanh Long; Bui, Anh Ngoc; Dao, Tung Duy; Thanh, Vu Thi; Wieland, Barbara",Transboundary and emerging diseases,96,1

We evaluated characteristics associated with obtaining a COVID-19 test from the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) and receiving a positive test result for COVID-19. METHODS We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of 6 292 800 veterans in VHA care at 130 VHA medical facilities. We assessed the number of tests for SARS-CoV-2 administered by the VHA (n = 822 934) and the number of positive test results (n = 82 094) from February 8 through December 28, 2020. We evaluated associations of COVID-19 testing and test positivity with demographic characteristics of veterans, adjusting for facility characteristics, comorbidities, and county-level area-based socioeconomic measures using nested generalized linear models. RESULTS In fully adjusted models, veterans who were female, Black/African American, Hispanic/Latino, urban, and low income and had a disability had an increased likelihood of obtaining a COVID-19 test, and veterans who were Asian had a decreased likelihood of obtaining a COVID-19 test. Compared with veterans who were White, veterans who were Black/African American (risk ratio [RR] = 1.23; 95% CI, 1.19-1.27) and Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander (RR = 1.13; 95% CI, 1.05-1.21) had an increased likelihood of receiving a positive test result. Hispanic/Latino veterans had a 43% higher likelihood of receiving a positive test result than non-Hispanic/Latino veterans did. CONCLUSIONS Although veterans have access to subsidized health care at the VHA, the increased risk of receiving a positive test result for COVID-19 among Black and Hispanic/Latino veterans, despite receiving more tests than White and non-Hispanic/Latino veterans, suggests that other factors (eg, social inequities) are driving disparities in COVID-19 prevalence.","Ferguson, Jacqueline M; Abdel Magid, Hoda S; Purnell, Amanda L; Kiang, Mathew V; Osborne, Thomas F",Public health reports,96,1

Design and Methods In this exploratory study, we prospectively included adult patients (aged ≥18 years) admitted between February 26 and April 30, 2020 to a tertiary care hospital in Switzerland. We assessed the association of an underlying SARS-CoV-2 infection and equilibrium serum levels of RAAS peptides in hospitalized COVID-19 patients 1:1 propensity-score matched with patients suffering from SARS-CoV-2-negative respiratory infections. Subgroup analyses involved stratification for taking RAAS inhibitors. Results COVID-19 patients had about 50% lower equilibrium serum RAAS peptide levels as compared with matched controls (angiotensin I: 31.6 vs. 66.8pmol/l, -52.7% [95%CI -68.5% to -36.9%]; angiotensin II: 37.7 vs. 92.5pmol/l, -59.2% [95%CI -72.1% to -46.3%]; angiotensin (1-5): 3.3 vs. 6.6pmol/l, -49.7% [95%CI -59.2% to -40.2%]; angiotensin (1-7): 4.8 vs. 7.6pmol/l, -64.9% [95%CI -84.5% to -45.3%]). While the plasma renin activity (PRA-S) was lower in COVID-19 patients (88.6 vs. 207.9pmol/l, -58.5% [95%CI -71.4% to -45.6%]), there was no difference of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and ACE2 plasma activity between the groups. Subgroup analyses revealed a pronounced RAAS peptide profile depression in COVID-19 patients among those not on RAAS inhibitors. Conclusions As compared with SARS-CoV-2-negative patients, we found a downregulated RAAS in presence of a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Whether the lower levels of the protective angiotensin (1-5) and (1-7) are linked to adverse outcomes in COVID-19 warrants further investigation.","Kutz, Alexander; Conen, Anna; Gregoriano, Claudia; Haubitz, Sebastian; Koch, Daniel; Domening, Oliver; Bernasconi, Luca; Mueller, Beat; Schuetz, Philipp",European journal of endocrinology,96,1

We aimed to synthesise the clinical evidence for lopinavir/ritonavir as a treatment for COVID-19. METHODS We performed a rapid review by searching databases including PubMed, GoogleScholar, medRxiv, ClinicalTrials.gov and the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, for COVID-19 studies comparing outcomes between patients who did and did not receive lopinavir/ritonavir. The quality of evidence was assessed using the GRADE criteria. RESULTS We identified five completed randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and 14 retrospective cohort studies. Two large RCTs of 5040 and 2771 hospitalised adults with COVID-19 found no evidence that lopinavir/ritonavir influenced the primary outcome of mortality, or secondary outcomes including progression to mechanical ventilation or time to discharge. Results remained similar in all sub-group analyses including by age, gender, baseline ventilation and time since symptom onset. Results from one of these trials were only available as a pre-print. The three smaller RCTs (n=86-199) also found no evidence of a benefit in the primary outcomes of time to clinical improvement or time to viral clearance. The 14 observational studies included between 50 and 415 participants, and were limited by a lack of adjustment for potential confounding variables. The majority of these studies found no evidence that lopinavir/ritonavir was associated with improved mortality or other clinical outcomes, although results regarding viral clearance were mixed.

Here, we report a unique mode of cell migration elicited by the lability of integrin ligands. We found that stationary cells spontaneously turn migratory on substrates where integrin ligands are subject to depletion by cellular force. Using TGT, a rupturable molecular linker, we quantitatively tuned the rate of ligand rupture by cellular force and tested platelets (anucleate cells), CHO-K1 cells (nucleated cells), and other cell types on TGT surfaces. These originally stationary cells readily turn motile on the uniform TGT surface, and their motility is correlated with the ligand depletion rate caused by cells. We named this new migration mode ligand-depleting (LD) migration. Through both experiments and simulations, we revealed the biophysical mechanism of LD migration. We found that the cells create and maintain a gradient of ligand surface density underneath the cell body by constantly rupturing local ligands, and the gradient in turn drives and guides cell migration. This is reminiscent of the phenomenon that some liquid droplets or solid beads can spontaneously move on homogeneous surfaces by chemically forming and maintaining a local gradient of surface energy. Here, we showed that cells, as living systems, can harness a similar mechanism to migrate. LD migration is beneficial for cells to maintain adhesion on ligand-labile surfaces, and might also play a role in the migration of cancer cells, immune cells, and platelets that deplete adhesive ligands of the matrix.","Sarkar, Anwesha; LeVine, Dana N; Kuzmina, Natalia; Zhao, Yuanchang; Wang, Xuefeng",Current biology : CB,96,4

Long-term costs and cost-effectiveness of these 2 treatment strategies from the perspective of the US healthcare system have not been compared. METHODS AND RESULTS Between 2009 and 2014, the ATTRACT trial (Acute Venous Thrombosis: Thrombus Removal With Adjunctive Catheter-Directed Thrombolysis) randomized 692 patients with acute proximal DVT to PCDT plus anticoagulation (n=337) or standard treatment with anticoagulation alone (n=355). Costs (2017 US dollars) were assessed over a 24-month follow-up period using a combination of resource-based costing, hospital bills, Medicare reimbursement rates, and the Drug Topics Red Book. Health state utilities were obtained from the Short Form-36. In-trial results and US life tables were used to develop a Markov cohort model to evaluate lifetime cost-effectiveness. For the PCDT group, mean costs of the initial procedure were $13 600; per-patient costs associated with the index hospitalization were $21 509 for PCDT and $3877 for standard care (difference=$17 632; 95% CI, $16 117-$19 243). The 24-month difference in costs was $20 045 (95% CI, $16 093-$24 120). Utility scores increased significantly between baseline and 6 months for both groups, with no significant differences between groups at any follow-up time point. Projected differences in lifetime costs of $16 740 and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of 0.08, yield an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for PCDT of $222 041/QALY gained. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the probability that PCDT would achieve a lifetime incremental cost-effectiveness ratio <$50 000/QALY or <$150 000/QALY was 1% and 25%, respectively. For iliofemoral DVT, QALY gains with PCDT were greater, yielding an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $137 526/QALY; for femoral-popliteal DVT, standard therapy was an economically dominant strategy. CONCLUSIONS With an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio >$200 000/QALY gained, PCDT is not an economically attractive treatment for proximal DVT.

MATERIALS AND METHODS A PubMed and Embase search was performed from 2003 to 2020. Search terms included: (transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt OR TIPS) AND (gastric varices OR fundal varices OR gastroesophageal varices OR gastroesophageal varices) AND (hemorrhage OR rebleeding OR rebleeding OR survival). Inclusion criteria spanned: English language studies, publication in peer reviewed journals, sample size ≥ 10, reported clinical outcome data, exclusive treatment of GVs (no esophageal varices), exclusive use of stent-grafts for TIPS, no chemical obliteration of GVs. Outcomes included GV rebleeding rate, overall rebleeding rate, GV occlusion rate, hepatic encephalopathy (HE) incidence, and adverse event (AE) rate. RESULTS Literature search yielded 936 articles. Of these, 5 (0.5%) retrospective observational cohort studies met inclusion criteria, spanning 209 patients (quinquagenarian men with viral or alcoholic liver disease) with GVs treated using TIPS with adjunctive coil embolization (47%). Clinical follow-up time ranged from 4.3 to 30.6 months. Outcomes included a pooled GV rebleeding rate of 15% (95% CI: 11%, 20%), total rebleeding rate of 21% (95% CI: 15%, 27%), GV occlusion rate of 33% (95% CI: 22%, 45%), HE incidence of 30% (95% CI: 24%, 36%), and AE incidence of 3% (95% CI: 1%, 8%).

In this study, we found that HEV replication in hepatoma cells inhibited poly(I·C)-induced beta interferon (IFN-β) expression and that the HEV open reading frame 1 (ORF1) product was responsible for this inhibition. Two domains, X and the papain-like cysteine protease domain (PCP), of HEV ORF1 were identified as the putative IFN antagonists. When overexpressed in HEK293T cells, the X domain (or macro domain) inhibited poly(I·C)-induced phosphorylation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3), which is the key transcription factor for IFN induction. The PCP domain was shown to have deubiquitinase activity for both RIG-I and TBK-1, whose ubiquitination is a key step in their activation in poly(I·C)-induced IFN induction. Furthermore, replication of a HEV replicon containing green fluorescent protein (GFP) (E2-GFP) in hepatoma cells led to impaired phosphorylation of IRF-3 and reduced ubiquitination of RIG-I and TBK-1, which confirmed our observations of X and PCP inhibitory effects in HEK293T cells. Altogether, our study identified the IFN antagonists within the HEV ORF1 polyprotein and expanded our understanding of the functions of several of the HEV ORF1 products, as well as the mechanisms of HEV pathogenesis. Importance: Type I interferons (IFNs) are important components of innate immunity and play a crucial role against viral infection. They also serve as key regulators to evoke an adaptive immune response. Virus infection can induce the synthesis of interferons; however, viruses have evolved many strategies to antagonize the induction of interferons. There is little knowledge about how hepatitis E virus (HEV) inhibits induction of host IFNs, though the viral genome was sequenced more than 2 decades ago. This is the first report of identification of the potential IFN antagonists encoded by HEV. By screening all the domains in the open reading frame 1 (ORF1) polyprotein, we identified two IFN antagonists and performed further research to determine how and at which step in the IFN induction pathway they antagonize host IFN induction. Our work provides valuable information about HEV-cell interaction and pathogenesis.","Nan, Yuchen; Yu, Ying; Ma, Zexu; Khattar, Sunil K; Fredericksen, Brenda; Zhang, Yan-Jin",Journal of virology,96,16

At any level of the hierarchy, an ever-increasing diversity of technologies can be applied to characterize the corresponding biological units and their relations, resulting in large networks of physical or functional proximities-e.g., proximities of amino acids within a protein, of proteins within a complex, or of cell types within a tissue. Here, we review general concepts and progress in using network proximity measures as a basis for creation of multiscale hierarchical maps of biological systems. We discuss the functionalization of these maps to create predictive models, including those useful in translation of genotype to phenotype, along with strategies for model visualization and challenges faced by multiscale modeling in the near future. Collectively, these approaches enable a unified hierarchical approach to biological data, with application from the molecular to the macroscopic.","Schaffer, Leah V; Ideker, Trey",Cell systems,96,1

Historically, psychologists have contributed to understanding the causes and consequences of poverty, as well as in interventions to ameliorate its effects. Less attention has been paid, however, to psychologists' unique contributions to studying and ending deep poverty, despite psychology's obvious relevance to the topic. As such, a working group was formed to develop the Deep Poverty Initiative (DPI), which had 3 main goals to engage psychologists in the fight against deep poverty: (a) change attitudes and perceptions about people living in deep poverty, (b) change policy to increase support for safety-net programs, and (c) change practices by increasing the use of psychological science and practice to build the capacity of poverty-serving organizations. First, 5 main themes from the psychological literature on deep poverty were identified by the DPI working group as crucial to changing attitudes. Compared to poverty, deep poverty was found to be especially dehumanizing, difficult to exit, and complex to solve, while also causing additional physical and psychological harm and obscuring human strengths. With this information as a basis, the working group mobilized psychologists to use the psychological science, along with their skills and positions within communities, to achieve the remaining goals of the initiative. Specific outputs, lessons learned, and suggestions for future work to continue to bring psychologists to the fight against deep poverty are given.

An updated guideline (MTG32) recommended using CT fractional flow reserve (CTFFR) as a gatekeeper to invasive coronary angiography (ICA) for patients with coronary stenosis on CTCA. Subsequently, NHS England negotiated a UK-wide contract with HeartFlow, the provider of CTFFR. We describe our experience with CTFFR and consider the impact of the recent ISCHEMIA trial on these guidelines. METHODS We prospectively collected ICA and revascularisation data on all patients undergoing CTFFR from January 2019 to March 2020. RESULTS One-hundred and twenty-five of 140 patients completed CTFFR analysis. Eighty-one patients had CTCA stenosis >50%. Thirty-six had positive CTFFR; 29 underwent ICA with 22 (75.9%) revascularised. Forty-five had negative CTFFR; 14 underwent ICA and four (28.6%) were revascularised. The average cost of investigation per patient (PP) was £971.95. Had these patients undergone ICA directly with no functional test after CTCA, the average cost would be £932.51 PP. CONCLUSION Our revascularisation rates suggest that CTFFR can potentially be a gatekeeper to ICA but does not necessarily yield cost savings.","Rasoul, Hazhee; Fyyaz, Saad; Noakes, Daniela; Shakespeare, Carl; David, Sarojini; Khawaja, Zeeshan M; Papamichail, Nikolaos; Alfakih, Khaled",Clinical medicine,96,1

Various SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have been developed and are being used for vaccination worldwide. However, no therapeutic agents against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been developed so far; therefore, new therapeutic agents are urgently needed. In the present study, we evaluated several hepatitis C virus direct-acting antivirals as potential candidates for drug repurposing against COVID-19. Theses include asunaprevir (a protease inhibitor), daclatasvir (an NS5A inhibitor), and sofosbuvir (an RNA polymerase inhibitor). We found that asunaprevir, but not sofosbuvir and daclatasvir, markedly inhibited SARS-CoV-2-induced cytopathic effects in Vero E6 cells. Both RNA and protein levels of SARS-CoV-2 were significantly decreased by treatment with asunaprevir. Moreover, asunaprevir profoundly decreased virion release from SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. A pseudoparticle entry assay revealed that asunaprevir blocked SARS-CoV-2 infection at the binding step of the viral life cycle. Furthermore, asunaprevir inhibited SARS-CoV-2 propagation in human lung Calu-3 cells. Collectively, we found that asunaprevir displays broad-spectrum antiviral activity and therefore might be worth developing as a new drug repurposing candidate for COVID-19.","Lim, Yun-Sook; Nguyen, Lap P; Lee, Gun-Hee; Lee, Sung-Geun; Lyoo, Kwang-Soo; Kim, Bumseok; Hwang, Soon B",Molecules and cells,96,30

These sites contribute to fundamental cellular processes including lipid biosynthesis, autophagy, apoptosis, ER-stress and calcium (Ca2+) signalling. At MERCS, Ca2+ ions are transferred from the ER directly to mitochondria through a core protein complex composed of inositol-1,4,5 trisphosphate receptor (InsP3R), voltage-gated anion channel 1 (VDAC1), mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) and adaptor protein glucose-regulated protein 75 (Grp75); this complex is regulated by several associated proteins. Deregulation of ER-mitochondria Ca2+ transfer contributes to pathogenesis of neurodegenerative and other diseases. The efficacy of Ca2+ transfer between ER and mitochondria depends on the protein composition of MERCS, which controls ER-mitochondria interaction regulating, for example, the transversal distance between ER membrane and OMM and the extension of the longitudinal interface between ER and mitochondria. These parameters are altered in neurodegeneration.

However, a wide inter-individual variability has been noted. The aim of this study was to identify patient-related factors affecting surgeon satisfaction with the surgical space and surgery duration in laparoscopic bariatric surgery under deep NMB. METHODS One hundred eighty-five patients scheduled for laparoscopic gastric bypass were enrolled. Anesthesia was standardized. A deep NMB was maintained together with fixed patient positioning (30 reverse Trendelenburg) and constant pneumoperitoneum pressure (14 mmHg) during the whole surgical procedure. Immediately after surgery, the surgeon was invited to state his satisfaction with the surgical space through a verbal numeric scale (VNS) ranging from 0 (extremely poor) to 10 (optimal). RESULTS VNS score was negatively correlated with male gender (r = - 0.35; p = 0.0001), BMI (r = - 0.16; p = 0.03), and age (r = - 0.20; p = 0.008). Surgery duration was positively correlated with male gender (r = 0.27; p = 0.0003) and BMI (r = 0.22; p = 0.006). Multivariate linear regressions showed that lower VNS scores were predicted by male gender (p = 0.000001) and increased age (p = 0.009), and that a longer surgery duration was predicted by male gender (p = 0.0002). CONCLUSIONS Findings showed that male gender and higher patient age were independent predictors of lower surgeon satisfaction with the workspace during laparoscopic bariatric surgery. Male gender also had a significant role in predicting longer surgery duration. The role of android obesity, which is more frequently associated with male gender, in affecting surgeon-perceived workspace conditions needs further investigation.","Aceto, Paola; Modesti, Cristina; Sacco, Teresa; De Cicco, Roberto; Perilli, Valter; Raffaelli, Marco; Lai, Carlo; Sollazzi, Liliana",Obesity surgery,96,1

Pmsf is a functional measure of the effective intravascular volume status. This study aims to assess the precision of the Pmsf-arm measurement. Pmsf-arm was measured by inflating a pneumatic tourniquet around the upper arm 50 mmHg above systolic pressure for 60 s, four times consecutively, with an interval of 5 min. Arterial (Pa) and venous pressure (Pv) were recorded every 10 s. Pa-Pv difference was calculated to determine the stop-flow time. The coefficient error (CE) was determined and used to derive the least significant change (LSC) in Pmsf-arm that this technique could reliably detect. The rANOVA test was used to compare repeated measurements of the four determinations of Pmsf-arm. 80 measurements of Pmsf-arm were studied in 20 patients. Pa and Pv equalised after 60 s of inflation (Pa-Pv difference 0 ± 0.01 mmHg). There were no significant differences of Pmsf-arm values among determinations. For a single measurement, the CE was 5 % (±2 %) and the LSC was 14 % (±5 %). Averaging two, three and four measurements the CE improves to 4 % (±1 %), 3 % (±1 %) and 3 % (±1 %) respectively, and the LSC was reduced to 10 % (±4 %), 8 % (±3 %) and 7 % (±3 %) respectively.

We also summarized the evidence supporting the efficacy of interventions, outcomes of interest and identified emerging research themes. A systematic PubMed MEDLINE search identified scholarly articles or reviews published between 2000-2020 that contained either a cohort, cross-sectional, or interventional study design and focused on the relationships between diet and/or exercise and overall levels of different forms of estrogen and breast cancer risk and occurrence. Screening and data extraction was undertaken by two researchers. Data synthesis was narrative due to the heterogeneous nature of studies. A total of 1625 titles/abstracts were screened, 198 full texts reviewed; and 43 met eligibility criteria. Of the 43 studies, 28 were randomized controlled trials, and 15 were observational studies. Overall, studies that incorporated both diet and exercise interventions demonstrated better control of detrimental estrogen forms and levels and thus likely represent the best strategies for preventing breast cancer development for postmenopausal women. Some of the strongest associations included weight loss via diet and diet + exercise interventions, reducing alcohol consumption, and consuming a varied dietary pattern, similar to the Mediterranean diet. More research should be done on the effects of specific nutritional components on endogenous estrogen levels to understand the effect that the components have on their own and in combination within the diet.","Wiggs, Alleigh G; Chandler, Justin K; Aktas, Aynur; Sumner, Susan J; Stewart, Delisha A",Frontiers in endocrinology,96,1

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA The COVID-19 pandemic heavily impacts health care systems worldwide. Cancer patients appear to have an increased risk for adverse events when infected by COVID-19, but the inability to receive oncological care seems may be an even larger threat, particularly in case of pancreatic cancer. METHODS An online survey was submitted to all members of seven international pancreatic associations and study groups, investigating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on pancreatic surgery using 21 statements (April, 2020). Consensus was defined as >80% agreement among respondents and moderate agreement as 60% to 80% agreement. RESULTS A total of 337 respondents from 267 centers and 37 countries spanning 5 continents completed the survey. Most respondents were surgeons (n = 302, 89.6%) and working in an academic center (n = 286, 84.9%). The majority of centers (n = 166, 62.2%) performed less pancreatic surgery because of the COVID-19 pandemic, reducing the weekly pancreatic resection rate from 3 [interquartile range (IQR) 2-5] to 1 (IQR 0-2) (P < 0.001). Most centers screened for COVID-19 before pancreatic surgery (n = 233, 87.3%). Consensus was reached on 13 statements and 5 statements achieved moderate agreement. CONCLUSIONS This global survey elucidates the role of pancreatic surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic, regarding patient selection for the surgical and oncological treatment of pancreatic diseases to support clinical decision-making and creating a starting point for further discussion.","Oba, Atsushi; Stoop, Thomas F; Löhr, Matthias; Hackert, Thilo; Zyromski, Nicholas; Nealon, William H; Unno, Michiaki; Schulick, Richard D; Al-Musawi, Mohammed H; Wu, Wenming; Zhao, Yupei; Satoi, Sohei; Wolfgang, Christopher L; Abu Hilal, Mohammad; Besselink, Marc G; Del Chiaro, Marco",Annals of surgery,96,31

However, outcomes in patients with COVID-19 with both cancer and comorbid CVD are unknown. METHODS This retrospective study included 2,476 patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at 4 Massachusetts hospitals between March 11 and May 21, 2020. Patients were stratified by a history of either cancer (n=195) or CVD (n=414) and subsequently by the presence of both cancer and CVD (n=82). We compared outcomes between patients with and without cancer and patients with both cancer and CVD compared with patients with either condition alone. The primary endpoint was COVID-19-associated severe disease, defined as a composite of the need for mechanical ventilation, shock, or death. Secondary endpoints included death, shock, need for mechanical ventilation, need for supplemental oxygen, arrhythmia, venous thromboembolism, encephalopathy, abnormal troponin level, and length of stay. RESULTS Multivariable analysis identified cancer as an independent predictor of COVID-19-associated severe disease among all infected patients. Patients with cancer were more likely to develop COVID-19-associated severe disease than were those without cancer (hazard ratio [HR], 2.02; 95% CI, 1.53-2.68; P<.001). Furthermore, patients with both cancer and CVD had a higher likelihood of COVID-19-associated severe disease compared with those with either cancer (HR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.11-3.10; P=.02) or CVD (HR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.21-2.66; P=.004) alone. Patients died more frequently if they had both cancer and CVD compared with either cancer (35% vs 17%; P=.004) or CVD (35% vs 21%; P=.009) alone. Arrhythmias and encephalopathy were also more frequent in patients with both cancer and CVD compared with those with cancer alone. CONCLUSIONS Patients with a history of both cancer and CVD are at significantly higher risk of experiencing COVID-19-associated adverse outcomes. Aggressive public health measures are needed to mitigate the risks of COVID-19 infection in this vulnerable patient population.","Ganatra, Sarju; Dani, Sourbha S; Redd, Robert; Rieger-Christ, Kimberly; Patel, Rushin; Parikh, Rohan; Asnani, Aarti; Bang, Vigyan; Shreyder, Katherine; Brar, Simarjeet S; Singh, Amitoj; Kazi, Dhruv S; Guha, Avirup; Hayek, Salim S; Barac, Ana; Gunturu, Krishna S; Zarwan, Corrine; Mosenthal, Anne C; Yunus, Shakeeb A; Kumar, Amudha; Patel, Jaymin M; Patten, Richard D; Venesy, David M; Shah, Sachin P; Resnic, Frederic S; Nohria, Anju; Baron, Suzanne J",Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network : JNCCN,96,1

The setting was a corporate hospital in Mumbai, India. METHODS The present prospective observational study was begun in January 2006. A total of 52 patients with uncontrolled T2DM and a body mass index of 30-35 kg/m(2) elected to undergo laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. The duration of T2DM was 3.5-14.5 years (median 8.4). Of the 52 patients, 61.5% had hypertension and 59.6% had dyslipidemia. Remission of T2DM and other components of the metabolic syndrome were assessed. All patients were followed up for 5 years. RESULTS The median percentage of excess weight loss was 72.2% at 1 year and 67.8% at 5 years. Of the 52 patients, 84.6% had achieved euglycemia and 73.1% had achieved complete remission, 23.1% partial remission, and 3.84% no remission at 1 year. Weight regain occurred in 8 patients. They required antihypertensive drugs and statins, decreasing the complete remission rate to 57.7% and partial remission rate to 38.5% at 5 years. However, 96.2% improvement in metabolic status was found at the end of 5 years. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is a safe, efficacious, and cost-effective treatment for uncontrolled T2DM in patients with a body mass index of 30-35 kg/m(2). Early-onset T2DM, better weight loss, and greater C-peptide levels were predictors of success after surgery. The improvement after surgery in hyperglycemia, hypertension, and dyslipidemia could help in controlling the occurrence of micro- and macrovascular complications and decrease the morbidity and mortality associated with T2DM.","Lakdawala, Muffazal; Shaikh, Shehla; Bandukwala, Saifee; Remedios, Carlyne; Shah, Miloni; Bhasker, Aparna Govil",Surgery for obesity and related diseases : official journal of the American Society for Bariatric Surgery,96,12

However, with multiple systematic reviews it is necessary to evaluate the methodological rigor to ensure the reliability of conclusions and recommendations for clinical practice. Therefore, the aim of this study was to appraise the quality of systematic reviews that examined the efficacy and/or safety of labour induction methods. METHODS An electronic search of MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library from 2000 to 2020 was conducted. Study selection, data extraction and quality assessment were conducted using A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) by two independent reviewers, in duplicate. RESULTS The search identified 387 publications, of which 48 studies (13%) met the a priori inclusion criteria. No significant relationships were found between study quality and number of citations, journal impact factor, or publication year. CONCLUSION Methodological quality for systematic reviews on the induction of labour were ranked as moderate with no significant changes in quality over the past 2 decades. Publication characteristics are not significantly associated with methodological quality, indicating that healthcare professionals should critically appraise studies before applying them to practice.","Chow, Ryan; Li, Allen; Wu, Nicole; Martin, Morgan; Wessels, Jocelyn M; Foster, Warren G",Archives of gynecology and obstetrics,96,19

Mouse models of Nrxn1α deficiency are not amenable to studying aspects of social cognition because, in general, mice do not engage in complex social interactions such as social play or prosocial helping behaviors. Rats, on the contrary, engage in these complex, well-characterized social behaviors. Using the Nrxn1tm1Sage Sprague Dawley rat, we tested a range of cognitive and social behaviors in juveniles with haplo- or biallelic Nrxn1α mutation. We found a deficit in ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) of male and female neonatal rats with Nrxn1α deficiency. A male-specific deficit in social play was observed in Nrxn1α-deficient juveniles, although sociability and social discrimination were unaltered. Nurturing behavior induced by exposure to pups was enhanced in male and female juveniles with biallelic Nrxn1α mutation. Performance in tasks of prosocial helping behavior and food retrieval indicated severe deficits in learning and cognition in juveniles with biallelic Nrxn1α mutation, and a less severe deficit in haploinsufficient rats, although Pavlovian learning was altered only in haploinsufficient males. We also observed a male-specific increase in mobility and object investigation in juveniles with complete Nrxn1α deficiency. Together, these observations more fully characterize the Nrxn1tm1Sage Sprague Dawley rat as a model for Nrxn1α-related neurodevelopmental disorders, and support a rationale for the juvenile rat as a more appropriate model for disorders that involve core deficits in complex social behaviors.

Moreover, there is no widely accepted definition of PRIS, even though it is a potentially fatal condition. While many suspected cases of PRIS have been reported in both pediatric and adult populations, the actual propofol plasma concentration (Cp) has never been clarified. In this clinical report, we described the first suspected PRIS case in which the propofol Cp was measured 25 min after 226 min of propofol infusion (7.2 µg/mL), which was 12 times higher than the predicted value (0.6 µg/mL). In the presented case, we observed gradually progressive uncontrollable hypercapnia and tachycardia, followed by severe lactic acidosis during surgical anesthesia based on the target-controlled infusion of propofol. Levels of liver enzymes were slightly elevated which suggests little or no liver damage though propofol is mainly metabolized by the liver. Meanwhile, renal impairment, a common secondary feature of PRIS, occurred concomitantly when hypercapnia and metabolic acidosis were manifested. In this case, low or delayed propofol clearance might have been a triggering factor causing severe lactic acidosis.","Ichikawa, Taku; Okuyama, Keiko; Kamata, Kotoe; Masui, Kenichi; Ozaki, Makoto",Journal of anesthesia,96,1

Here we demonstrate that exposure of AN to the biologically-important inflammatory oxidant, peroxynitrous acid (ONOOH), either as a bolus or formed at low levels in a time-dependent manner from SIN-1, impairs the capability of AN to polymerize FN. In contrast, exposure of FN to ONOOH does not seem to affect superfibronectin formation to the same extent. This oxidant-induced loss-of-function in AN occurs in a dose-dependent manner, and correlates with structural perturbations, loss of the amino acid tyrosine and tryptophan, and dose-dependent formation of modified amino acid side-chains (3-nitrotyrosine, di-tyrosine and 6-nitrotryptophan). Reagent ONOOH also induces formation of oligomeric species which decrease in the presence of bicarbonate, whereas SIN-1 mainly generates dimers. Modifications were detected at sub-stoichiometric (0.1-fold), or greater, molar excesses of oxidant compared to AN. These species have been localized to specific sites by peptide mass mapping. With high levels of oxidant (>100 times molar excess), ONOOH also induces unfolding of the beta-sheet structure of AN, thermal destabilization, and formation of high molecular mass aggregates. These results have important implications for the understanding of FN fibrillogenesis in vivo, and indicates that AN is highly sensitive to pathophysiological levels of oxidants such as ONOOH.","He, Jianfei; Becares, Eva Ramos; Thulstrup, Peter Waaben; Gamon, Luke F; Pedersen, Jannik Nedergaard; Otzen, Daniel; Gourdon, Pontus; Davies, Michael J; Hägglund, Per",Redox biology,96,17

Real-life data on its safety and efficacy during a centre's early experience are sparse. Methods and results Thirty patients (28 persistent/longstanding persistent AF) underwent standalone VATS ablation for AF by an experienced thoracoscopic surgeon, with the first 20 cases proctored by external surgeons. Procedural and follow-up outcomes were collected prospectively, and compared with 90 propensity-matched patients undergoing contemporaneous catheter ablation (CA). Six (20.0%) patients undergoing VATS ablation experienced ≥1 major complication (death n = 1, stroke n = 2, conversion to sternotomy n = 3, and phrenic nerve injury n = 2). This was significantly higher than the 1.1% major complication rate (tamponade requiring drainage n = 1) seen with CA (P < 0.001). Twelve-month single procedure arrhythmia-free survival rates without antiarrhythmic drugs were 56% in the VATS and 57% in the CA cohorts (P = 0.22), and 78% and 80%, respectively given an additional CA and antiarrhythmic drugs (P = 0.32). Conclusion During a centre's early experience, VATS ablation may have similar success rates to those from an established CA service, but carry a greater risk of major complications.

Without adequate access to healthy foods, weight maintenance can be hindered. OBJECTIVE Examine influence degree of food access has on Appalachian bariatric surgery patient weight loss outcomes. SETTING Appalachian University hospital, United States. METHODS A retrospective chart review was used to examine the influence of food accessibility on weight loss outcomes in an Appalachian bariatric surgery patient population at a large tertiary hospital in West Virginia between 2013 and 2017. Demographic characteristics, health and family history, and 1-year surgery outcomes were collected. A state-specific food accessibility score was calculated for each patient address using the geographic information system. Patients were assigned a food access ranking score (FARS) between 0 (low food access) and 4 (high food access) based on criteria of quantity, quality, income, and vehicle access. RESULTS Patients (n = 369) were predominately married (60.5%), white (92.4%), female (77.8%), and underwent laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (75.9%), with a mean age of 45 years. Most patients had low FARS (M = 1.67 ± .73; 72.6%). Nonwhite patients (P = .03) with a preoperative diagnosis of depression (P = .02) or without a family history of obesity (P = .01) were found to be in the lower FARS categories. FARS was not indicative of weight loss post surgery (P > .05). CONCLUSIONS Food accessibility in West Virginia was not associated with bariatric surgery weight outcomes at 1-year post operation. Lower food access was associated with nonwhite race/ethnicity, diagnosed depression at baseline, and no family history of obesity. Future studies should include more extended follow-up data collection and mixed-method approaches to capture perceptions of food access and its impact on the patients' postoperative journey.","Barr, M L; Tabone, L E; Brode, C; Szoka, N; Olfert,",Surgery for obesity and related diseases : official journal of the American Society for Bariatric Surgery,96,24

Human adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (Ad-MSCs) exert immunomodulatory effects by inhibiting effector T cell responses and have been used to treat diverse immune disorders. We aimed to investigate the modulating effect of human Ad-MSCs on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients with PD, focusing on differentiation into Th17 and Treg cells. Methods We isolated human peripheral blood CD4+T cells and co-cultured them with Ad-MSCs at a ratio of 4:1 under either Th17 or Treg cell polarizing conditions for 4 days to detect the proportions of IL-17-producing CD4+T (Th17) and CD4+CD25+Foxp3+regulatory T (Treg) cells by flow cytometry. We also determined the mRNA expression levels of the retinoid-related orphan nuclear receptor (RORγt) transcription factor and those of interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R), interleukin-23 receptor (IL-23R), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), and LIF receptor (LIFR) by quantitative reverse transcription PCR. We detected levels of cytokines in the supernatant (including LIF, IL-6, IL-23, IL-10, and TGF-β) using ELISA. Results Our results showed that Ad-MSCs specifically inhibited the differentiation of PBMCs of patients with PD into IL-17-producing CD4+T cells by decreasing expressions of IL-6R, IL-23R, and RORγt (the key transcription factor for Th17 cells). Moreover, Ad-MSCs induced a functional CD4+CD25+Foxp3+T regulatory cell phenotype as evidenced by the secretion of IL-10. The levels of IL-6, IL-23, and TGF-β remained constant after co-culture under either the Th17 or the Treg cell polarizing condition. In addition, levels of LIF protein and its receptor mRNA were significantly increased under both polarizing conditions. Conclusion The present in vitro study found that Ad-MSCs from healthy participants were able to correct the imbalance between Th17 and Treg found in PBMCs of PD patients, which were correlated with an increase in LIF secretion and a decrease in expression of IL-6R, IL-23R, and RORγt. These findings should be confirmed by in vivo experiments.","Bi, Yong; Lin, Xiaobin; Liang, Huazheng; Yang, Dehao; Zhang, Xiaowei; Ke, Jianming; Xiao, Jingjing; Chen, Zhilin; Chen, Weian; Zhang, Xu; Wang, Shaoshi; Liu, Chun-Feng",Clinical interventions in aging,96,6

The purpose of the current study is to investigate psychological resilience and depression in individuals during the period of COVID-19 outbreak in Turkey in relation to different variables. The study also aims to explore the relationship between psychological resilience and depression. SUBJECTS AND METHODS The current study was conducted on a total of 518 people over the social media through the Google e-forms. In the study, the ""Short Psychological Resilience Scale"" and the ""Beck Depression Scale"" were used to collect data. In the analysis of the collected data, t-test, One Way Anova, Mann-Whitney U Test, Kruskal Wallis-H Test, Pearson Correlation Coefficient were used. RESULTS In the current study, psychological resilience and depression were investigated in relation to different variables. Psychological resilience was found to be higher male participants, educators,university graduates and groups with not mental health problems. Depression was found to be higher females, university students, high school and lower graduates,with mental health problems. When the relationship between psychological resilience and depression was investigated, it was found that there is a medium and negative correlation between them. Moreover, the cut-off point for the depression score was set to be 17 and the rate of the people having 17 points or higher scores was found to be 16.6%.

Effective audits can establish a framework for reporting research efforts, ensuring accurate reporting, and spearheading quality improvement. Although a variety of data auditing models and standards exist, barriers to effective auditing including costs, regulatory requirements, travel, and design complexity must be considered. MATERIALS AND METHODS The Congenital Cardiac Research Collaborative conducted a virtual data training initiative and remote source data verification audit on a retrospective multicentre dataset. CCRC investigators across nine institutions were trained to extract and enter data into a robust dataset on patients with tetralogy of Fallot who required neonatal intervention. Centres provided de-identified source files for a randomised 10% patient sample audit. Key auditing variables, discrepancy types, and severity levels were analysed across two study groups, primary repair and staged repair. RESULTS Of the total 572 study patients, data from 58 patients (31 staged repairs and 27 primary repairs) were source data verified. Amongst the 1790 variables audited, 45 discrepancies were discovered, resulting in an overall accuracy rate of 97.5%. High accuracy rates were consistent across all CCRC institutions ranging from 94.6% to 99.4% and were reported for both minor (1.5%) and major discrepancies type classifications (1.1%).

Animal and human challenge studies and observational studies suggest T cells protect against disease among those infected, but the impact of T-cell immunity at the population level is unknown. OBJECTIVES To investigate whether naturally preexisting T-cell responses targeting highly conserved internal influenza proteins could provide cross-protective immunity against pandemic and seasonal influenza. METHODS We quantified influenza A(H3N2) virus-specific T cells in a population cohort during seasonal and pandemic periods between 2006 and 2010. Follow-up included paired serology, symptom reporting, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) investigation of symptomatic cases. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS A total of 1,414 unvaccinated individuals had baseline T-cell measurements (1,703 participant observation sets). T-cell responses to A(H3N2) virus nucleoprotein (NP) dominated and strongly cross-reacted with A(H1N1)pdm09 NP (P < 0.001) in participants lacking antibody to A(H1N1)pdm09.

The presence of NP-specific T cells before exposure to virus correlated with less symptomatic, PCR-positive influenza A (overall adjusted odds ratio, 0.27; 95% confidence interval, 0.11-0.68; P = 0.005, during pandemic [P = 0.047] and seasonal [P = 0.049] periods). Protection was independent of baseline antibodies. Influenza-specific T-cell responses were detected in 43%, indicating a substantial population impact. CONCLUSIONS Naturally occurring cross-protective T-cell immunity protects against symptomatic PCR-confirmed disease in those with evidence of infection and helps to explain why many infections do not cause symptoms. Vaccines stimulating T cells may provide important cross-protective immunity.","Hayward, Andrew C; Wang, Lili; Goonetilleke, Nilu; Fragaszy, Ellen B; Bermingham, Alison; Copas, Andrew; Dukes, Oliver; Millett, Elizabeth R C; Nazareth, Irwin; Nguyen-Van-Tam, Jonathan S; Watson, John M; Zambon, Maria; Johnson, Anne M; McMichael, Andrew J",American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine,96,25

OBJECTIVE. Although chest CT is the standard imaging modality in early diagnosis and management of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the use of lung ultrasound (US) presents some advantages over the use of chest CT and may play a complementary role in the workup of COVID-19. The objective of our study was to investigate US findings in patients with COVID-19 and the relationship of the US findings with the duration of symptoms and disease severity. MATERIALS AND METHODS. From March 3, 2020, to March 30, 2020, consecutive patients with a positive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction test result for the virus that causes COVID-19 were enrolled in this study. Lung US was performed, and the imaging features were analyzed. The Fisher exact test was used to compare the percentages of patients with each US finding between groups with different symptom durations and disease severity. RESULTS. Our study population comprised 28 patients (14 men and 14 women; mean age ± SD, 59.8 ± 18.3 years; age range, 21-92 years). All 28 patients (100.0%, 28/28) had positive lung US findings. The most common findings were the following: B-lines (100.0%, 28/28), consolidation (67.9%, 19/28), and a thickened pleural line (60.7%, 17/28). A thickened pleural line was observed in a higher percentage of patients with a longer duration of the disease than in those with a shorter duration of the disease, and pulmonary consolidations were more common in severe and critical cases than in moderate cases. CONCLUSION. Typical lung US findings in patients with COVID-19 included B-lines, pulmonary consolidation, and a thickened pleural line. In addition, our results indicate that lung US findings can be be used to reflect both the infection duration and disease severity.","Zhang, Yao; Xue, Heng; Wang, Mixue; He, Nan; Lv, Zhibin; Cui, Ligang",AJR.

RECENT FINDINGS Recent evidence supports the use of physical activity and other nonpharmacologic therapies, either alone or with pharmacological therapies, for pain management. Nonopioid analgesics, including acetaminophen, topical analgesics, gabapentinoids, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and TCA may be considered based on pain cause and type, with careful dose considerations in kidney disease. NSAIDs may be used in CKD and ESKD for short durations with careful monitoring. Opioid use should be minimized and reserved for patients who have failed other therapies. Opioids have been associated with increased adverse events in this population, and thus should be used cautiously after risk/benefit discussion with the patient. Opioids that are safer to use in kidney disease include oxycodone, hydromorphone, fentanyl, methadone, and buprenorphine. Buprenorphine appears to be a promising and safer option due to its partial agonism at the mu opioid receptor. SUMMARY Pain is poorly managed in patients with kidney disease. Nonpharmacological and nonopioid analgesics should be first-line approaches for pain management. Opioid use should be minimized with careful monitoring and dose adjustment.","Roy, Payel J; Weltman, Melanie; Dember, Laura M; Liebschutz, Jane; Jhamb, Manisha",Current opinion in nephrology and hypertension,96,31

Adapting neuropsychology services using teleneuropsychology models (e.g. video or telephone assessments) may not always be a viable option for all providers and settings. Based on the existing teleneuropsychology literature, we propose a ""contactless"" evidence-based inpatient test battery to be used for in-person assessments amenable to physical distancing. Method: In addition to the proposed test battery, we suggest a decision-making workflow process to help readers determine the appropriateness of the proposed methods given their patients' needs. Considerations for special populations (i.e. seniors, patients with brain injury, psychiatric patients), feedback, limitations of the proposed physical distancing approach, and future directions are also discussed. Conclusions: Our aim is that the suggested teleneuropsychology-informed battery and model may inform safe and practical neuropsychological inpatient assessments during the COVID-19 pandemic and other situations requiring contact precautions for infection prevention and control.","Parlar, Melissa E; Spilka, Michael J; Wong Gonzalez, Daniela; Ballantyne, Elena C; Dool, Catherine; Gojmerac, Christina; King, Jelena; McNeely, Heather; MacKillop, Emily",The Clinical neuropsychologist,96,28

Forty Holstein dairy heifers with a mean age of 84 d and average body weight (BW) of 100.9 ± 11.2 kg were housed in a naturally ventilated freestall barn. Heifers were blocked by birth date and randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatments in a completely randomized block design: (1) 100 g of soybean meal carrier (control), (2) 0.25 g of SB/kg of BW plus carrier, (3) 0.50 g of SB/kg of BW plus carrier, and (4) 0.75 g of SB/kg of BW plus carrier. Carrier with or without SB was top-dressed and hand-mixed into a total mixed ration once daily. Heifers were fed to provide 10% orts. Initial BW, hip and withers heights, heart girth, and body length were measured before the start of the study and every week thereafter until the 14-wk trial was over. Blood samples were obtained and plasma urea nitrogen, plasma glucose, and whole-blood β-hydroxybutyrate concentrations were determined before the start of treatment and weekly thereafter until the conclusion of the study. Fecal samples were taken before treatment and every other week from each heifer for coccidia counts. Apparent total-tract nutrient digestibility was determined using acid detergent insoluble ash as an internal marker. Each heifer underwent this phase from d 47 until d 54 of the study. Sodium butyrate had a positive effect on average BW and overall BW gain. Feed efficiency tended to improve as SB supplementation increased. Coccidia counts were lowest in the treatment with 0.25 g of SB/kg of BW plus carrier. Sodium butyrate had no effects on skeletal growth or plasma urea nitrogen concentration. Blood glucose concentration decreased linearly and β-hydroxybutyrate increased linearly with increasing levels of SB supplementation. Sodium butyrate supplementation did not affect apparent total-tract nutrient digestibility. Sodium butyrate supplementation offers positive results in the growth performance and feed efficiency of postweaned heifers.","Rice, E M; Aragona, K M; Moreland, S C; Erickson, P S",Journal of dairy science,96,1

We evaluated the role of Escherichia coli by assessing the frequency of genes encoding virulence factors (virotypes) in E. coli from feces or intestinal contents, and the association of these virotypes or other diarrheagenic pathogens with intestinal morphologic changes in calves with or without diarrhea. E. coli was isolated from 408 feces and 105 intestines of calves with diarrhea and compared to those isolated from 635 feces and 100 intestines of calves without diarrhea, from 2002 to 2016. Virotype EAST1:F17, in combination with minor virotypes, was the most commonly detected type, but without differences in frequency between the 2 groups of calves. No significant intestinal morphologic changes were observed with the different E. coli virotypes in either group of calves, except for bacterial attachment to enterocytes for virotype STa:F5, which was detected only in calves with diarrhea. These observations suggest that E. coli, excluding virotype STa:F5, is not a significant diarrhea-causing agent in calves. However, the intestinal lesions observed in ~82% of calves with diarrhea were attributed to other diarrheagenic pathogens that include bovine coronavirus, Clostridium perfringens, Cryptosporidium spp., Eimeria spp., rotavirus, and Salmonella spp.","Ngeleka, Musangu; Godson, Dale; Vanier, Ghyslaine; Desmarais, Gabriel; Wojnarowicz, Chris; Sayi, Soraya; Huang, Yanyun; Movasseghi, Rambod; Fairbrother, John M","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",96,7

We systematically reviewed evidence of the effects of proactive case detection by CHWs in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) on mortality, morbidity and access to care for common childhood illnesses. Methods Published studies were identified via electronic databases from 1978 to 2017. We included randomised and non-randomised controlled trials, controlled before-after studies and interrupted time series studies, and assessed their quality for risk of bias. We reported measures of effect as study investigators reported them, and synthesised by outcomes of mortality, disease prevalence, hospitalisation and access to treatment. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) as a principal summary measure, with CIs adjusted for cluster design effect. Results We identified 14 studies of 11 interventions from nine LMICs that met inclusion criteria. They showed considerable diversity in intervention design and implementation, comparison, outcomes and study quality, which precluded meta-analysis. Proactive case detection may reduce infant mortality (RR: 0.52-0.94) and increase access to effective treatment (RR: 1.59-4.64) compared with conventional community-based healthcare delivery (low certainty evidence). It is uncertain whether proactive case detection reduces mortality among children under 5 years (RR: 0.04-0.80), prevalence of infectious diseases (RR: 0.06-1.02), hospitalisation (RR: 0.38-1.26) or increases access to prompt treatment (RR: 1.00-2.39) because the certainty of this evidence is very low. Conclusion Proactive case detection may provide promising benefits for child health, but evidence is insufficient to draw conclusions. More research is needed on proactive case detection with rigorous study designs that use standardised outcomes and measurement methods, and report more detail on complex intervention design and implementation.

However, our understanding of the causes and consequences of individual variation in RMR in the wild is hampered by a lack of data, as well as analytical challenges. RMR measurements in the wild are generally characterized by large measurement errors and a strong dependency on mass. The latter is problematic when assessing the ability of RMR to evolve independently of mass. Mixed models provide a powerful and flexible tool to tackle these challenges, but they have rarely been used to estimate repeatability of mass-independent RMR from field data. We used respirometry to obtain repeated measurements of RMR in a long-term study population of snow voles (Chionomys nivalis) inhabiting an environment subject to large circadian and seasonal fluctuations in temperature. Using both uni- and bivariate mixed models, we quantify individual repeatability in RMR and decompose repeatability into mass-dependent and mass-independent components, while accounting for measurement error. RMR varies among individuals, i.e. is repeatable (R=0.46), and strongly co-varies with BM. Indeed, much of the repeatability of RMR is attributable to individual variation in BM, and the repeatability of mass-independent RMR is reduced by 41% to R=0.27. These empirical results suggest that the evolutionary potential of RMR independent of mass may be severely constrained. This study illustrates how to leverage bivariate mixed models to model field data for metabolic traits, correct for measurement error, and decompose the relative importance of mass-dependent and mass-independent physiological variation.","Hagmayer, Andres; Camenisch, Glauco; Canale, Cindy; Postma, Erik; Bonnet, Timothée",Journal of evolutionary biology,96,5

However, current imaging techniques cannot assess the in vivo functioning of small arteries such as the lenticulostriate artery in the brain of rats. Here, we report a novel method to achieve a high resolution multi-functional imaging of the cerebrovascular system using synchrotron radiation angiography, which is based on spatio-temporal analysis of contrast density in the arterial cross section. This method provides a unique tool for studying the sub-cortical vascular elasticity after cerebral ischemia in rats. Using this technique, we demonstrated that the vascular elasticity of the lenticulostriate artery decreased from day 1 to day 7 after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion in rats and recovered from day 7 to day 28 compared to the controls (p < 0.001), which paralleled with brain edema formation and inversely correlated with blood flow velocity (p < 0.05). Our results demonstrated that the change of vascular elasticity was related to the levels of brain edema and the velocity of focal blood flow, suggesting that reducing brain edema is important for the improvement of the function of the lenticulostriate artery in the ischemic brain.","Lin, Xiaojie; Miao, Peng; Mu, Zhihao; Jiang, Zhen; Lu, Yifan; Guan, Yongjing; Chen, Xiaoyan; Xiao, Tiqiao; Wang, Yongting; Yang, Guo-Yuan",Physics in medicine and biology,96,1

The frequently used psychostimulant-induced hyperactivity test appears to have lower validity than previously described, but other quick, simple and high throughput tests are currently unavailable. NEW METHOD In the context of modeling the behavioral facets of mania, we previously suggested that the sweet solution preference test (SSP) in naive mice might have predictive validity for screening anti-manic effects. The current study further examined this proposal by testing the effects of lithium, valproate and imipramine on SSP in three strains of mice (male mice from the black Swiss, ICR and C57bl/6 strains) and an exploratory test in females (black Swiss strain). RESULTS Data demonstrate that lithium and valproate at appropriate dosing schedules significantly and reliably reduce SSP in all three strains (including in females) but that the antidepressant imipramine has no effects. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS The results support the utilization of the SSP as mice screening model for anti-manic effects of drugs with stronger predictive validity compared with other methods. CONCLUSIONS The SSP is not a comprehensive model for bipolar disorder but it has good predictive validity and strong practical value that can be applied towards simple and fast screening of large numbers of animals, without the need for specialized equipment or complicated/prolonged procedures. We therefore propose that the SSP is an advantageous screening assay for testing novel mood stabilizing drugs for anti-manic properties.","Kara, Nirit; Flaisher-Grinberg, Shlomit; Einat, Haim",Journal of neuroscience methods,96,31

AIM To report clinical features and outcomes of a group of patients with Covid-19 admitted to a Chilean regional reference Center. MATERIAL AND METHODS Cases were identified by a compatible clinical picture and a positive PCR or serological test. Clinical features of patients were retrieved from medical records. RESULTS Forty-seven adult patients (45 diagnosed by PCR, 2 by serology) were admitted between epidemiological weeks 13 to 33, corresponding to 4.4% of total regional cases. Hospitalization occurred at a median of 10 days after onset of symptoms. Fifty one percent of patients had 60 years or more. Hypertension, obesity and diabetes mellitus were present in 57, 45 and 32 % of cases, respectively. Nineteen percent of patients had no comorbid condition nor were elderly. Two cases were women in their second trimester of pregnancy. Positive IgM or IgM/IgG results obtained by rapid serological testing, had limited sensitivity during the first week (67%). Seventeen patients (36.2%) were transferred to an intensive care unit (ICU) due to respiratory failure. Chest imaging demonstrated a classical COVID-19 pattern in 87%. By univariate analysis, admission to ICU was significantly associated with tachypnea and higher CALL (comorbidity, age, lymphocyte count and lactate dehydrogenase) score. Four patients died (rendering a hospital mortality of 8.5%) and length of stay was ≥ 14 days in 46.8% of patients. By univariate analysis, mortality was associated with immunosuppression and ICU admission. CONCLUSIONS In our regional Center, patients admitted with COVID-19 had usual risk factors and had a prolonged stay.

We found that xenogenized tumor cells were readily recognized and engulfed by dendritic cells; thereby, tumor antigens were efficiently presented to T lymphocytes. Moreover, exosome-VSV-G itself acts as a TLR4 agonist and stimulates the maturation of dendritic cells, leading to CD8+ T cell cross-priming. The administration of these exosomes in multiple tumor mouse models xenogenized tumor cells, resulting in tumor growth inhibition. The combinatorial treatment with anti-PD-L1 exhibited complete tumor regression (30%) and better long-term overall survival. These results suggest that tumor xenogenization by fusogenic exosomes provides a previously unidentified novel strategy for cancer immunotherapy.","Kim, Gi Beom; Nam, Gi-Hoon; Hong, Yeonsun; Woo, Jiwan; Cho, Yakdol; Kwon, Ick Chan; Yang, Yoosoo; Kim, In-San",Science advances,96,17

Primary closure of the hernia defect has been suggested to improve long-term abdominal wall function. However, this can be technically challenging and time consuming. This study describes laparoscopic use of non-absorbable barbed sutures in primary closure of hernia defects in addition to intraperitoneal mesh. METHODS Patients who underwent laparoscopic primary ventral hernia repair with mesh were prospectively reviewed. Two groups were defined: Operations performed with barbed sutures for primary closure in addition to mesh and operations with only mesh without defect repair. The surgical technique involved running the hernia defect with a 2-polypropylene non-absorbable unidirectional barbed suture and subsequently fixing the mesh intraperitoneally with tacks. In both groups, a single transfascial centering suture was also utilized. RESULTS Twenty-eight cases with barbed suture and mesh reinforcement and 29 cases with mesh-only were identified. The average dimensions of the ventral hernia defects were 57.8 (6-187) and 44.6 cm(2) (9-156) in the barbed suture with mesh and mesh-only group, respectively, p = 0.23. Median operating time was 78 min (range 35-187 min) in the barbed suture with mesh group versus 62 min (34-155 min) in the mesh-only group, p = 0.44. The median suturing time of closing the ventral hernia defect was 16 min (11-24 min). There were no differences in the pain scores. Mean follow-up for both groups was 8.2 ± 3.6 months (1-17 months) with one hernia recurrence in the mesh-only group, p = 0.41. CONCLUSIONS The barbed suture closure system could be used for rapid and effective primary defect closure in laparoscopic ventral hernia repair in addition to intraperitoneal mesh placement. No significant difference in operating time was detected when compared to the mesh-only approach. Further evidence to support these findings and longer follow-up periods is warranted to evaluate short- and long-term complications.","Nguyen, David; Szomstein, Samuel; Ordonez, Alex; Dip, Fernando; Rajan, Meenakshi; Menzo, Emanuele Lo; Rosenthal, Raul J",Surgical endoscopy,96,1

METHODS All stroke patients treated by thrombectomy (June 2015-October 2018) were prospectively enrolled in this observational study. At 90 days, functional outcome was assessed by the mRS, and patient-reported HRQoL by the EuroQol Group 5 Dimension (EQ-5D) Self-report Questionnaire, consisting of five health domains. The EQ-5D utility index (EQ-5D-I; -0.594 to 1.00 with higher values indicating better HRQoL) was calculated. Linear regression analysis was applied to identify predictors of better HRQoL (higher EQ-5D-I). RESULTS Of 504 patients (median age 76 years, 51.8% female), the mean EQ-5D-I was 0.39 (SD 0.44). The proportion of stroke survivors who reported complaints in the different domains decreased from 66% in Usual Activities, to 57% in Mobility, 50.4% in Selfcare, 41.7% in Pain/Discomfort and 40.8% Anxiety/Depression. A lower age, a lower pre-stroke mRS, a lower baseline NIHSS, and a higher ASPECT score, concomitant thrombolysis therapy, and a successful recanalization were independent predictors of better HRQoL. CONCLUSIONS Patient-reported HRQoL provides a more comprehensive assessment of stroke outcome than the mRS. Health domains involving motor function showed most frequently complaints in HRQoL after stroke thrombectomy, while a large proportion of patients did not report any complaints across the different health domains. Predictors of better HRQoL closely match the predictors of better functional outcome measured by the mRS in other thrombectomy studies.","Deb-Chatterji, Milani; Konnopka, Alexander; Flottmann, Fabian; Leischner, Hannes; Fiehler, Jens; Gerloff, Christian; Thomalla, Götz",Neurology,96,9

In healthy newborn babies, nephrogenesis takes place unnoticed until birth. Upon delivery, morphogenetic activity in the nephrogenic zone decreases, and the stem cell niches aligned beyond the organ capsule vanish by an unknown signal. However, this signal also plays a key role in preterm and low birth weight babies. Although they are born in a phase of active nephrogenesis, pathological findings illustrate that they evolve to a high incidence oligonephropathy and prematurity of renal parenchyma. Different extra- and intrauterine influences seem to be responsible, but independent from chemical nature, all of them culminate in the nephrogenic zone. One assumes that the marred development is caused either by an overshoot of metabolites, misleading signaling of morphogens, unbalanced synthesis of extracellular matrix or restricted contact between mesenchymal and epithelial stem cells. Even more surprising is that there is only a few vague morphological information of the nephrogenic zone in the human fetal kidney available and ultrastructural data is severely lacking. On this account, the first coordinates were determined by optical microscopy and morphometry. Without claiming to be complete, generated results made it possible to create schematic illustrations true to scale for orientation. It will help graduating students, young pediatricians, pathologists, and scientists working in the field of biomedicine to interpret professionally the nephrogenic zone and contained niches.","Minuth, Will W",Nephron,96,1

Recognizing factors that affect HRQoL is key in delivering patient-centered care. AIM To identify factors most commonly associated with a poor HRQoL in adults with cirrhosis in a systematic review of the literature. METHODS Four databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL and PsycINFO) were searched from inception to March 2020, using terms related to patient-reported outcomes plus cirrhosis. Studies that analyzed an association between at least one factor and HRQoL in adult patients with cirrhosis were included. Abstract and full-text screening was performed by two reviewers. Data were collected on factors evaluated in each study and the significance of their association with HRQoL. RESULTS A total of 10,647 citations were reviewed, of which 109 met eligibility criteria. 76% of the studies used a generic instrument while only 45% used liver-specific instruments. Among identified factors, demographic factors and cirrhosis etiology were not generally associated with poor HRQoL except for poor social support. Depression, poor sleep and muscle cramps affected HRQoL in all the studies that evaluated them. Among comorbidities, frailty, falls, malnutrition and cognitive impairment were also associated with poor HRQoL in the majority of studies. Among cirrhosis-specific decompensating events, only hepatic encephalopathy (HE) was consistently associated with impairment in HRQoL (75% of studies). CONCLUSION Many factors impact poor HRQoL in patients with cirrhosis such as depression, muscle cramps, poor sleep, falls, frailty and malnutrition. Among cirrhosis decompensating events, HE was the complication most commonly associated with a poor HRQoL.","Rabiee, Anahita; Ximenes, Rafael Oliveira; Nikayin, Sina; Hickner, Andy; Juthani, Prerak; Rosen, Robert H; Garcia-Tsao, Guadalupe",Liver international : official journal of the International Association for the Study of the Liver,96,1

METHODS Cross-sectional study conducted in two hospitals in Queensland, Australia. All patients admitted to hospital from the ED between 24 May and 16 August 2009 with an acute respiratory illness were included. All had nasal and throat swabs taken. Data were collected from clinical chart review regarding clinical symptoms, co-morbidities, examination findings, pathology and radiology results. Influenza A status was detected by reverse transcription-PCR assay. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed to identify independent predictors of influenza A status. RESULTS 346 consecutive patients were identified, of which 106 were positive for 2009 H1N1 influenza; an additional 11 patients were positive for other influenza A viruses. Independent clinical predictors (with points allocated using weighted scoring) for all types of influenza A in patients admitted with acute respiratory illness were: age 18-64 years (2 points); history of fever (2); cough (1); normal level of consciousness (2); C-reactive protein >5 and ≤ 100 mg/l (2) and normal leucocyte count (1). A clinical score of 5 (presence of two or three predictors) gave a sensitivity of 93% (95% CI 87% to 96%), specificity of 36% (95% CI 30% to 42%), resulting in a negative-predictive value of 91% (95% CI 83% to 95%). CONCLUSION A clinical prediction tool was developed that may be able to assist in making appropriate isolation decisions during future 2009 H1N1 outbreaks.","Keijzers, Gerben B; Vossen, Caleb Nathaniel Kai-Lik; Zhang, Ping; Macbeth, Debourough; Derrington, Petra; Gerrard, John Gregory; Doust, Jenny",Emergency medicine journal : EMJ,96,29

The objective of this study was to characterize the effects of diurnal heat stress (dHS) on nursery-grower pig performance, intestinal integrity, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) translocation. Forty-eight nursery-grower gilts, individually penned, were randomly assigned to two treatments. Twenty-four pigs were then exposed to dHS for 3 d, 6 h at 38°C and 18 h at 32°C, at 40-60% humidity. The remaining pigs were maintained under thermal neutral (TN) conditions. Changes in pig rectal temperatures (Tr), respiration rates (RR), performance, and blood parameters were evaluated. Additionally, ex vivo ileum integrity was assessed with the Ussing chamber by measuring transepithelial resistance (TER), and 4 kDa fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran (FD4) and FITC-LPS mucosal to serosal flux. As expected, dHS increased pig Tr and RR (P < 0.05) and reduced pig performance (P < 0.05) on the 3-d period. Compared with TN, ileum TER (P = 0.04), FITC-LPS (P < 0.001), and FD4 (P = 0.011) permeability were significantly increased due to dHS. Compared with TN pigs, dHS increased serum endotoxin by 150% (P = 0.031). Altogether, 3-d dHS significantly reduced pig performance and intestinal integrity and increased blood endotoxin concentrations.","Gabler, Nicholas K; Koltes, Dawn; Schaumberger, Simone; Murugesan, G Raj; Reisinger, Nicole",Translational animal science,96,1

Although proprioceptive information from the muscles that cross this joint has been shown to be vital in this process, the specific source of this information remains questionable. Recent research has been focused on the potential role of tibialis anterior (TA) muscle during standing, largely due to the lack of modulation of its activity throughout the sway cycle. Ten young, healthy subjects were asked to stand normally under varying conditions, for periods of 60 s. During these trials, intramuscular electromyographic (EMG) activity and the fascicle length of three distinct anatomical regions of TA were sampled synchronously with kinematic data regarding sway position. In the quiet standing conditions, TA muscle activity was unmodulated and fascicle length changes in each region were tightly coupled with changes in sway position. In the active sway condition, more EMG activity was observed in TA and the fascicle length changes were decoupled from sway position. No regional specific differences in correlation values were observed, contrasting previous observations. The ability of the fascicles to follow sway position builds upon the suggestion that TA is well placed to provide accurate, straightforward sensory information to the CNS. As previously suggested, through reciprocal inhibition, afferent information from TA could help to regulate plantar flexor torque at relevant phases of the sway cycle. The proprioceptive role of TA appears to become complicated during more challenging conditions.","Day, James T; Lichtwark, Glen A; Cresswell, Andrew G",Journal of applied physiology,96,5

The CRT incidence diagnosed with ultrasound examination was compared between patients applying CGCD and combined 10% aqueous povidone-iodine and standard transparent dressings (PITD) after central venous catheter insertion into the internal jugular vein for ≥ 48 h. CRT was stratified into early (within 7 days) and late (days 8-14) thromboses.

METHODS Outpatients aged 14-21, suffering from various psychiatric disorders, were assessed using the Mentalization Questionnaire (MZQ), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), using data from age-matched healthy students for comparison. The relationship between CTQ, MZQ, and BDI scores was examined at the cross-sectional level, including mediation analyses, and longitudinally, in a subsample who underwent a psychotherapy intervention. RESULTS Of 83 subjects, 33 (39.8%) had mentalization levels that were 1 standard deviation below those of comparison subjects. In the whole sample, the levels of mentalization were inversely associated with BDI (r = -.68, p < .001) and CTQ scores (r = -.30, p = .006). Moreover, MZQ scores mediated a large part of the effect of childhood trauma on depression (total effect: 10.6, 95% CI: 5.3, 15.9; direct effect: 6.5, 95% CI: 2.1, 10.8; indirect effect: 4.1, 95% CI: 1.5, 7.4). This effect was almost entirely explained by the Affect Regulation subscale. In patients re-evaluated after four sessions (n = 37), the decrease in BDI scores correlated with the increase in MZQ scores (r = .40, p = .02).

Although pulmonary health has been the primary focus of studies during the early days of COVID-19, development of a comprehensive understanding of this emergent disease requires knowledge of all possible disease manifestations in affected patients. This PRISMA-compliant review focuses on cutaneous manifestations reported in COVID-19 patients. APPROACH Literature review was conducted using the PubMed database to examine various cutaneous manifestations related to the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Published articles (n=56) related to search criteria from the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic to June 30, 2020 were included. The primary literature articles included in this paper were mainly from France, Spain, Italy, and the UK. RESULTS Unique to many other symptoms of COVID-19, its cutaneous manifestations have been found in people of all age groups including children. The cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 are varied and include maculopapular, chilblain-like, urticarial, vesicular, livedoid, and petechial lesions. In addition, rashes are common in multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), a new and serious health condition that shares symptoms with Kawasaki disease and is likely related to COVID-19. In addition, personal protective equipment (PPE)-related skin wounds are of serious concern since broken cutaneous barriers can create an opening for potential COVID-19 infections. Innovation and Conclusion: As this virus continues to spread silently, mainly through asymptomatic carriers, an accurate and rapid identification of these cutaneous manifestations may be vital to early diagnosis and lead to possible better prognosis in COVID-19 patients. This systematic review and photo atlas provide a detailed analysis of the skin pathologies related to COVID-19. Study of these cutaneous manifestations, their pathogenesis, as well their significance in human health will help define COVID-19 in its entirety which is a prerequisite to its effective management.","Singh, Harjas; Kaur, Harleen; Singh, Kanhaiya; Sen, Chandan K",Advances in wound care,96,27

Cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2) was reportedly associated with the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and cognitive function. However, data concerning the association between cerebral rSO2 and dietary intake of CKD patients is limited. METHODS This was a single-center observational study. We recruited 67 CKD patients not undergoing dialysis. Cerebral rSO2 was monitored using the INVOS 5100c oxygen saturation monitor. Energy intake was evaluated by dietitians based on 3-day meal records. Daily protein and salt intakes were calculated from 24-h urine collection. RESULTS Multivariable regression analysis showed that cerebral rSO2 was independently associated with energy intake (standardized coefficient: 0.370) and serum albumin concentration (standardized coefficient: 0.236) in Model 1 using parameters with p < 0.10 in simple linear regression analysis (body mass index, Hb level, serum albumin concentration, salt and energy intake) and confounding factors (eGFR, serum sodium concentration, protein intake), and the energy/salt index (standardized coefficient: 0.343) and Hb level (standardized coefficient: 0.284) in Model 2 using energy/protein index as indicated by energy intake/protein intake and energy/salt index by energy intake/salt intake in place of salt, protein and energy intake. CONCLUSIONS Cerebral rSO2 is affected by energy intake, energy/salt index, serum albumin concentration and Hb level. Sufficient energy intake and adequate salt restriction is important to prevent deterioration of cerebral oxygenation, which might contribute to the maintenance of cognitive function in addition to the prevention of renal dysfunction in CKD patients.","Ookawara, Susumu; Kaku, Yoshio; Ito, Kiyonori; Kizukuri, Kanako; Namikawa, Aiko; Nakahara, Shinobu; Horiuchi, Yuko; Inose, Nagisa; Miyahara, Mayako; Shiina, Michiko; Minato, Saori; Shindo, Mitsutoshi; Miyazawa, Haruhisa; Hirai, Keiji; Hoshino, Taro; Murakoshi, Miho; Tabei, Kaoru; Morishita, Yoshiyuki",PloS one,96,10

For example, in polluted habitats, melanin can have a detoxifying function. Melanic coloration would help to sequester in the skin the heavy metals contaminants from inside the body, which will be expulsed to the exterior when the skin is sloughed. Moreover, animals should have evolved more melanic colorations in more polluted habitats (""industrial melanism"" hypothesis). We examined whether the fossorial amphisbaenian reptile, Trogonophis wiegmanni, is able to eliminate heavy metals, derived from soil pollution by seagulls depositions, through sloughing its skin. Our results suggest a covariation between levels of soil pollution by heavy metals and the concentration of heavy metals in the sloughed skins of amphisbaenians. This suggests that amphisbaenians may expel heavy metals from their bodies when they slough the skins. We also tested whether amphisbaenians inhabiting soils with higher levels of heavy metal pollution had darker (melanin-dependent) body colorations. However, contrary to predictions from the ""industrial melanization"" hypothesis, we found a negative relationship between soil pollution and proportions of melanic coloration. This contradictory result could, however, be explained because heavy metals have endocrine disruption effects that increase physiological stress, and higher stress levels could result in decreased melanogenesis. We suggest that although amphisbaenians might have some detoxifying mechanism linked to melanin in the skin, this process might be negatively affected by stress and result ineffective under conditions of high soil pollution.

Moreover, wound healing assay and transwell assay were performed to evaluate the effect of OR3A4 on the metastasis of OC. Furthermore, the underlying mechanism was explored by RT-qPCR and Western blot assay. RESULTS The expression level of OR3A4 in OC samples was significantly higher than that of adjacent tissues. Moreover, cell migration and invasion were significantly repressed after OR3A4 knockdown in vitro. Moreover, the mRNA and protein expressions of kruppel-like factor 6 (KLF6) were remarkably upregulated after knockdown of OR3A4. Furthermore, the expression level of KLF6 was negatively correlated with the expression of OR3A4 in OC tissues. CONCLUSIONS Our results showed that OR3A4 could enhance OC cell metastasis and invasion via suppressing KLF6.

These data were subdivided into country by top-level domain, normalized by population, and grouped together by World Bank income levels and English-speaking status. This methodology was also repeated to compare individual episodes on topics more versus less relevant to learners in LMIC. Findings: Over a 2-year period, the three podcasts had a total of 2.3 million unique downloads and were listened to in 192 of 207 countries worldwide. Overall, 91.5% of downloads were in HI countries, with 8.2% in LMIC. A total of 86.1% of listens were in countries with English as an official or unofficial listed language, whereas 13.8% were in countries without. Normalized for population, listeners in HI countries represented 970.5 listens per million population compared with 12.4 per million in LMIC. An analysis of individual episodes by topic showed that material more relevant to learners in LMIC had significantly more listeners from these countries. Insights: Compared with other forms of ODE, medical podcasting has much lower uptake in LMIC. However, there are considerable opportunities for growth. Medical podcasters in HI countries should be aware of a potential global audience and should take concrete steps to ensure a diversity of content and to periodically audit their data. Medical educators in LMIC should consider podcasting as a potentially powerful form of teaching. International medical educational organizations as well as podcasting organizations should provide resources for educators in these countries.","Rodman, Adam; Abrams, Hannah R; Watto, Matthew; Trivedi, Shreya; Barbee, Jeff; Meraz-Munoz, Alejandro; Fried, Martin C",Teaching and learning in medicine,96,1

The COVID-19 pandemic poses unique challenges to support exchanges between the generations; however, the pandemic may provide opportunities for greater solidarity within families. In this review, we draw from theoretical perspectives that have been used to study family relationships to understand the implications of the pandemic for multigenerational families: the life course perspective, the intergenerational solidarity model, and rational choice/social exchange theory. We review literature on multigenerational relationships in the United States and discuss how established social support patterns and processes may be altered by the COVID-19 pandemic. We reflect on how the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on multigenerational relationships may vary by gender, race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. Finally, we provide directions for future researchers to pursue in order to understand the lasting impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on multigenerational ties.","Gilligan, Megan; Suitor, J Jill; Rurka, Marissa; Silverstein, Merril",Journal of family theory & review,96,1

SUBJECT AND METHOD The sample of the study consisted of (258) male and female students from Al Ain University students from humanities and scientific colleges. The modified Mental Health Scale: R S CL-90 Symptoms Check List was used, which was developed by Derogatis, Lipman, and Linocovi, it included (74) items divided into seven dimensions: physical symptoms, obsessive-compulsive disorder, reactive sensitivity, depression, anxiety, enmity, and fear anxiety, after modifying it for the purposes of the study. RESULTS The results showed that the level of mental health of the sample as a whole was very high. The results also showed that the level of mental health was low for females when compared to males. The second-year students were less in the level of mental health compared to the rest of the levels. For students who were less than twenty years old, the level of mental health was low compared to those over twenty years old. No differences were found in the level of mental health among students of scientific and human colleges. As for the social situation, the level of mental health among single students was low compared to married people. CONCLUSION The results of the study indicate that the higher the average mental problems (the dimensions of the mental health level), the lower of the mental health problems.

This study aimed to assess the feasibility of delivering RFA to locations within the colon and to determine a range of safe treatment parameters. METHODS Patients undergoing left hemicolectomy or proctocolectomy were evaluated. Focal RFA using a colonoscope-mounted device was delivered to normal segments of the colon and rectum within the planned surgical resection specimen. Endoscopic accessibility and feasibility of delivering heat energy to the colon and rectum were assessed as well as the maximum incurred histologic depth of ablation in relation to the number of applications (2 or 4) and the energy density (12, 15, or 20 J/cm2). RESULTS A total of 51 ablation zones in 16 patients had available histopathology. None of the sites receiving two applications demonstrated serosal layer alteration compared with 15% of the sites receiving four applications (p=0.11). Muscularis propria alterations were seen in 25% of the two-application sites and 63% of the four-application sites (p<0.05). Increasing energy density from 12 to 20 J/cm2 did not correlate with a deeper ablation effect. CONCLUSIONS Endoscopic RFA is capable of delivering therapy to the distal colon. Injury is limited to the muscularis propria or less depth when no more than two ablations are applied regardless of the energy density used. Based on these feasibility and dosimetry results, the authors will continue investigation using these and smaller energy doses to initiate trials ultimately with patients who have suitable mucosal and submucosal disorders of the lower gastrointestinal tract including chronic, nonulcerated hemorrhagic radiation proctitis and angiodyplasia.","Trunzo, Joseph A; McGee, Michael F; Poulose, Benjamin K; Willis, Joseph E; Ermlich, Bridget; Laughinghouse, Michelle; Champagne, Bradley J; Delaney, Conor P; Marks, Jeffrey M",Surgical endoscopy,96,12

Multi-valvular endocarditis, which is seen less frequently than single valvular endocarditis, is often a fatal disease. In this article, we present a case of endocarditis with native mitral and tricuspid valve involvement in a patient without any underlying predisposing factors. Case report:A 62-year-old patient was admitted to hospital with shortness of breath without any underlying predisposing factors. Covid-19 PCR swab was negative. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed bi-sided valve endocarditis with mitral and tricuspid valve involvement. The patient was taken to the intensive care unit. Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography revealed valvular involvement, flail mitrale with severe regurgitation on both valvules. The patient and patient's relatives refused the valvular operation because of the higher risk. Despite the antibiotic treatment, the general condition of the patient deteriorated and died. Conclusion:Multi-valvular endocarditis is a serious disorder with high mortality. In diagnosis, imaging procedures should be utilized as early as possible. Staphylococci are the most common pathogens in such cases, in which early diagnosis and treatment, particularly using a surgical approach, are appropriate.","Bolat, Kubra; Yildirim, Murat; Baltali, Sevim; Karabag, Turgut",Maedica,96,1

The aim of our study was to compare the image quality of simulated neurointerventions with regular and reduced radiation doses using a standard flat panel detector system. MATERIALS AND METHODS Ten 3D-printed intracranial aneurysm models were generated on the basis of a single patient vasculature derived from intracranial DSA and CTA. The incident dose to each model was reduced using a 0.7-mm-thick copper attenuator with a circular ROI hole (10-mm diameter) in the middle mounted inside the Infinix C-arm. Each model was treated twice with a primary coiling intervention using ROI-dose-reduced intervention and regular-dose intervention protocols. Eighty images acquired at various intervention stages were shown twice to 2 neurointerventionalists who independently scored imaging qualities (visibility of aneurysm-parent vessel morphology, associated vessels, and/or devices used). Dose-reduction measurements were performed using an ionization chamber. RESULTS A total integral dose reduction of 62% per frame was achieved. The mean scores for regular-dose intervention and ROI dose-reduced intervention images did not differ significantly, suggesting similar image quality. Overall intrarater agreement for all scored criteria was substantial (Kendall τ = 0.62887; P < .001). Overall interrater agreement for all criteria was fair (κ = 0.2816; 95% CI, 0.2060-0.3571).

Very little is known regarding the incidence, risk factors and impact of procedure-related adverse events (AE) on pediatric A-HPCC outcomes. METHODS Prospective 4.5-year review of AE associated with pediatric A-HPCC. AE were graded by severity and type. Potential demographic and procedural risk factors, and the impact on product quality, were compared by t-test, chi-square, and linear regression. RESULTS Sixty-two children underwent 110 A-HPCC, including 36 (58%) under 20 kg. Fifty-five AE were documented in 25.4% A-HPCCs and 39% of children (citrate 25%, access 19%, technical 11%, cardiovascular 0%, allergic 1.8%). No AE were noted in children < 10 kg anticoagulated with heparin. Access and technical AE accounted for 73% of severe AE, with line-related problems underlying most technical AE (87.5%, P = 0.006). AE were more likely in older (P = 0.012), heavier patients (P = 0.02), who frequently required more than one A-HPCC (P = 0.012). In contrast, young children were more likely to experience citrate AE with gastrointestinal symptoms (median age, 6 years; P = 0.076). AE had no impact on CD34 collection rates; however, mean CD34 yields (4.2 vs. 20.4 million/kg; P = 0.0035) were decreased in patients with technical AE due to lower peripheral CD34 counts and a high number of aborted procedures (37%). CONCLUSION Venous access and flow-related issues are a major factor associated with moderate and severe AE, effecting ∼10% of patients. AE are more frequent with increasing patient age, weight, and number of procedures. J. Clin.

The presence of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein elicits a robust, 2-fold nanosensor fluorescence increase within 90 min of spike protein exposure. We characterize the nanosensor stability and sensing mechanism and passivate the nanosensor to preserve sensing response in saliva and viral transport medium. We further demonstrate that these ACE2-SWCNT nanosensors retain sensing capacity in a surface-immobilized format, exhibiting a 73% fluorescence turn-on response within 5 s of exposure to 35 mg/L SARS-CoV-2 virus-like particles.

Assessing the antibody status of patients with cancer and HCWs can help understand the spread of COVID-19 in cancer care. Objective To evaluate serum SARS-CoV-2 antibody status in patients with cancer and HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan. Design, Setting, and Participants Participants were enrolled for this prospective cross-sectional study between August 3 and October 30, 2020, from 2 comprehensive cancer centers in the epidemic area around Tokyo, Japan. Patients with cancer aged 16 years or older and employees were enrolled. Participants with suspected COVID-19 infection at the time of enrollment were excluded. Exposures Cancer of any type and cancer treatment, including chemotherapy, surgery, immune checkpoint inhibitors, radiotherapy, and targeted molecular therapy. Main Outcomes and Measures Seroprevalence and antibody levels in patients with cancer and HCWs. Seropositivity was defined as positivity to nucleocapsid IgG (N-IgG) and/or spike IgG (S-IgG). Serum levels of SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies against the nucleocapsid and spike proteins were measured by chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay. Results A total of 500 patients with cancer (median age, 62.5 years [range, 21-88 years]; 265 men [55.4%]) and 1190 HCWs (median age, 40 years [range, 20-70 years]; 382 men [25.4%]) were enrolled. In patients with cancer, 489 (97.8%) had solid tumors, and 355 (71.0%) had received anticancer treatment within 1 month. Among HCWs, 385 (32.3%) were nurses or assistant nurses, 266 (22.4%) were administrative officers, 197 (16.6%) were researchers, 179 (15.0%) were physicians, 113 (9.5%) were technicians, and 50 (4.2%) were pharmacists. The seroprevalence was 1.0% (95% CI, 0.33%-2.32%) in patients and 0.67% (95% CI, 0.29%-1.32%) in HCWs (P = .48). However, the N-IgG and S-IgG antibody levels were significantly lower in patients than in HCWs (N-IgG: β, -0.38; 95% CI, -0.55 to -0.21; P < .001; and S-IgG: β, -0.39; 95% CI, -0.54 to -0.23; P < .001). Additionally, among patients, N-IgG levels were significantly lower in those who received chemotherapy than in those who did not (median N-IgG levels, 0.1 [interquartile range (IQR), 0-0.3] vs 0.1 [IQR, 0-0.4], P = .04). In contrast, N-IgG and S-IgG levels were significantly higher in patients who received immune checkpoint inhibitors than in those who did not (median N-IgG levels: 0.2 [IQR, 0.1-0.5] vs 0.1 [IQR, 0-0.3], P = .02; S-IgG levels: 0.15 [IQR, 0-0.3] vs 0.1[IQR, 0-0.2], P = .02). Conclusions and Relevance In this cross-sectional study of Japanese patients with cancer and HCWs, the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies did not differ between the 2 groups; however, findings suggest that comorbid cancer and treatment with systemic therapy, including chemotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors, may influence the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.","Yazaki, Shu; Yoshida, Tatsuya; Kojima, Yuki; Yagishita, Shigehiro; Nakahama, Hiroko; Okinaka, Keiji; Matsushita, Hiromichi; Shiotsuka, Mika; Kobayashi, Osamu; Iwata, Satoshi; Narita, Yoshitaka; Ohba, Akihiro; Takahashi, Masamichi; Iwasa, Satoru; Kobayashi, Kenya; Ohe, Yuichiro; Yoshida, Tomokazu; Hamada, Akinobu; Doi, Toshihiko; Yamamoto, Noboru",JAMA oncology,96,1

The presence of the SFTS virus (SFTSV) in companion, livestock, and wild animals has been reported. Recently, human SFTS-like clinical symptoms in cats and cheetahs have been reported in Japan. Therefore, the prevalence of the SFTSV gene or antibody in cats is important for public health as well as veterinary medicine. Materials and Methods: Sera were collected from 201 feral and house cats in the ROK in 2017. Samples were analyzed for the presence of the SFTSV gene after RT-nested PCR amplification and for anti-SFTSV antibodies after enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Results: Eight (4.0%) and nine (4.5%) of 201 cat sera were found to be positive for the SFTSV gene and anti-SFTSV nucleocapsid protein antibodies, respectively. Specifically, 5.9% feral and 2.0% house cats were positive for the SFTSV gene, and 6.9% feral and 2.0% house cats were positive for anti-SFTSV antibodies. All sequences of the SFTSV S segment obtained were included in Japanese/Korean SFTSV clades, as opposed to the Chinese clade. Conclusions: This study constitutes the first serological study of SFTSV in house and feral cats in the ROK. Evidence of SFTSV in companion animals indicates that SFTSV can circulate in homes and that more intensive precautions and education measures are needed for companion animal guardians and veterinarians.","Kang, Jun-Gu; Cho, Yoon-Kyung; Han, Sun-Woo; Jeon, Kyeongseok; Choi, Hooncheol; Kim, Jong-Ho; Cho, Nam-Hyuk; Choi, Kyoung-Seong; Chae, Joon-Seok",Vector borne and zoonotic diseases,96,33

Although the incidence of intraoperative awareness is more common among patients who reported a dream after surgery, the exact correlation between the two phenomena remains an unsolved rebus. The main purpose of this study was to investigate anesthetic dreaming, anesthesia awareness and psychological consequences eventually occurred under deep sedation. Intraoperative dreaming experiences were correlated with dream features in natural sleep. METHODS Fifty-one patients, undergoing surgical excision of fibroadenomas under a Bispectral index-guided deep sedation anesthesia with propofol target controlled infusion, were enrolled into this prospective study. Psychological assessment was performed through the State Trait Anxiety Inventory. A questionnaire was adopted to register dreaming and anesthesia awareness. Data were collected after emergence (t0), 24 hours (t1), 1 month (t2), 6 months (t3). RESULTS Six patients (12%) reported anesthetic dreaming at t0 confirming the response at each subsequent evaluation. One patient (2%) confirmed dreaming during anesthesia in all, but denied it at t0. There was a high correlation between the intraoperative dream contents and the features of dreams in natural sleep. No cases of anesthesia awareness were detected. A similar level of satisfaction was observed in dreaming and no-dreaming patients. CONCLUSIONS Anesthetic dreaming does not seem to influence satisfaction of patients undergoing deep sedation with propofol target controlled infusion. A psychological assessment would seem to improve the evaluation of possible psychological consequences in dreamer patient.","Cascella, Marco; Fusco, Roberta; Caliendo, Domenico; Granata, Vincenza; Carbone, Domenico; Muzio, Maria Rosaria; Laurelli, Giuseppe; Greggi, Stefano; Falcone, Francesca; Forte, Cira Antonietta; Cuomo, Arturo",Oncotarget,96,16

BACKGROUND Stenting vascular stenoses is safe and effective in adults and older children with CHD but is limited in smaller children. The design of the Valeo stent addresses these limitations but has not been extensively described. METHODS Bench testing was conducted to determine the maximum diameter of the stent, foreshortening, and side-cell diameter. A retrospective analysis of Valeo stents implanted between October, 2012 and October, 2014 was performed. Patient profile, pre-implant/post-implant catheterization data, and stent geometry were reviewed. RESULTS Bench testing: medium and large Valeo stents can be dilated up to 13 mm and 20 mm diameters, respectively. Side-cells are dilatable up to 12 mm. Valeo stents are of low profile - delivered through 6- or 7-Fr sheaths - and show minimal foreshortening. Retrospective analysis: a total of 81 stents were implanted in 61 patients with CHD. The median weight was 15.3 kg, and the median age was 58.9 months. Stents were implanted in the pulmonary artery, systemic vein, aorta, and pulmonary vein. Overall, mean vessel diameters increased from 4.1 to 7.7 mm (121.7%). There was effective mean gradient reduction: 3.7-0.5 mmHg (63%) in the venous systems, 28.2-12.5 mmHg (63.7%) in the pulmonary arteries, and 17.4-4 mmHg (77.1%) in the aorta. The mean stent foreshortening was 2.5%, and the mean recoil was 5.9%. Side-cells that crossed other vessels were dilated in four cases, and stents were re-mounted onto different-sized balloons in seven cases. CONCLUSIONS The features of the Valeo stent, such as low profile, large maximum diameter, open-cell design, minimal foreshortening, and recoil, make it suitable for treating vascular stenoses in small children with CHD.","Travelli, Frances C; Sullivan, Patrick M; Takao, Cheryl; Ing, Frank F",Cardiology in the young,96,1

Before resuming endoscopic activity, we designed a protocol to evaluate gastroscopies and colonoscopies cancelled during the pandemic, denying inappropriate requests and prioritizing appropriate ones. METHODS two types of inappropriate request were established: a) COVID-19 context, people aged ≤ 50 years without alarm symptoms and a low probability of relevant endoscopic findings; and b) inappropriate context, requests not in line with clinical guidelines or protocols. Denials were filed in the medical record. Appropriate requests were classified into priority, conventional and follow-up. Requests denied by specialty were compared and the findings of priority requests were evaluated. RESULTS between March 16th and June 30th 2020, 1,658 requests (44 % gastroscopies and 56 % colonoscopies) were evaluated, of which 1,164 (70 %) were considered as appropriate (priority 8.5 %, conventional 48 %, follow-up 43 % and non-evaluable 0.5 %) and 494 (30 %) as inappropriate (20 % COVID-19 context, 80 % inappropriate context). The reasons for denial of gastroscopy were follow-up of lesions (33 %), insufficiently studied symptoms (20 %) and relapsing symptoms after a previous gastroscopy (18 %). The reasons for denial of colonoscopies were post-polypectomy surveillance (25 %), colorectal cancer after surgery (21 %) and a family history of cancer (13 %). There were significant differences in denied requests according to specialty: General Surgery (52 %), Hematology (37 %) and Primary Care (29 %); 31 % of priority cases showed relevant findings. CONCLUSIONS according to our study, 24 % of endoscopies were discordant with scientific recommendations.

A self-reported survey was used to evaluate stressors, impact on perceived performance, and intentions to quit. The data were analyzed using t-tests and linear regression models. RESULTS Responses of 119 HCPs were analyzed. Findings suggest that (1) compared to physicians, nurses experienced a higher level of distress and burnout, and used more maladaptive coping strategies. (2) Both nurses and physicians experienced more distress and burnout during COVID-19 than before. (3) Adaptive coping strategies moderated the negative impact of stress on work performance (4) Adaptive coping strategies moderated the negative effect of stress on burnout, which in turn reduced intentions to quit. Stress negatively impacted work performance and burnout only for those with low, but not high, levels of adaptive coping strategies. DISCUSSION The current findings of HCPs' challenges, risks, and protective factors provide valuable information (1) on COVID-19's impact on HCPs, (2) to guide the distribution of institutional supportive efforts and recommend adaptive coping strategies, and (3) to inform medical education, such as resilience training, focusing on adaptive coping approaches.","Lou, Nigel Mantou; Montreuil, Tina; Feldman, Liane S; Fried, Gerald M; Lavoie-Tremblay, Mélanie; Bhanji, Farhan; Kennedy, Heather; Kaneva, Pepa; Harley, Jason M",The Journal of continuing education in the health professions,96,1

Objective To report the initial experience in Singapore with the epidemiologic investigation of this outbreak, clinical features, and management. Design, Setting, and Participants Descriptive case series of the first 18 patients diagnosed with polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection at 4 hospitals in Singapore from January 23 to February 3, 2020; final follow-up date was February 25, 2020. Exposures Confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Main Outcomes and Measures Clinical, laboratory, and radiologic data were collected, including PCR cycle threshold values from nasopharyngeal swabs and viral shedding in blood, urine, and stool. Clinical course was summarized, including requirement for supplemental oxygen and intensive care and use of empirical treatment with lopinavir-ritonavir. Results Among the 18 hospitalized patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (median age, 47 years; 9 [50%] women), clinical presentation was an upper respiratory tract infection in 12 (67%), and viral shedding from the nasopharynx was prolonged for 7 days or longer among 15 (83%). Six individuals (33%) required supplemental oxygen; of these, 2 required intensive care. There were no deaths. Virus was detectable in the stool (4/8 [50%]) and blood (1/12 [8%]) by PCR but not in urine. Five individuals requiring supplemental oxygen were treated with lopinavir-ritonavir. For 3 of the 5 patients, fever resolved and supplemental oxygen requirement was reduced within 3 days, whereas 2 deteriorated with progressive respiratory failure. Four of the 5 patients treated with lopinavir-ritonavir developed nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea, and 3 developed abnormal liver function test results. Conclusions and Relevance Among the first 18 patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Singapore, clinical presentation was frequently a mild respiratory tract infection. Some patients required supplemental oxygen and had variable clinical outcomes following treatment with an antiretroviral agent.","Young, Barnaby Edward; Ong, Sean Wei Xiang; Kalimuddin, Shirin; Low, Jenny G; Tan, Seow Yen; Loh, Jiashen; Ng, Oon-Tek; Marimuthu, Kalisvar; Ang, Li Wei; Mak, Tze Minn; Lau, Sok Kiang; Anderson, Danielle E; Chan, Kian Sing; Tan, Thean Yen; Ng, Tong Yong; Cui, Lin; Said, Zubaidah; Kurupatham, Lalitha; Chen, Mark I-Cheng; Chan, Monica; Vasoo, Shawn; Wang, Lin-Fa; Tan, Boon Huan; Lin, Raymond Tzer Pin; Lee, Vernon Jian Ming; Leo, Yee-Sin; Lye, David Chien",JAMA,96,16

On December 31, 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) informed the public for the first time about causes of pneumonnia of unknown origin, in the city of Wuhan (Hubei Province, China), in people who were epidemiologically linked to a seafood and wet animal whole sale local market in Wuhan. Coronavrus disease, called COVID-19 (Corona virus disease 2019), after China quickly spread to most countries in the wold, and the WHO on March 11, 2020 declared a pandmic with this virus. SARS-CoV-2, has a high level of sequential similarities to the SARS-CoV-1 and uses the same receptors when it enters the human body (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2/ACE2). COVID-19 is respiratry infection that is primarily transmitted via respiratry droplets. Typical symptoms of COVID-19 infection can be very moderate (infected can be even asymptomatic) to very severe, with severe respiratory symptoms (bilateral severe pneumonia), septic schock, and fatal outcome. Numeous unknows regarding the biological, epidemilogical adn clinical characteristics of COVID-19, still exist, and make it impossible to predict with certainty the further course of the current pandemic. COVID-19 is primarily a disease of the respiratory system, but SARS-CoV-2, in a number of patients also penetrates the CNS, and apparently could be responsible for fatal outcome in some cases. The entrry of the virus into the brain can lead to neurological and psychiatric manifestationss, which are not uncommon, including headache, paresthesia, myalgia, impaired consciousnessm, confusion or delirum and cerebrovascular diseases. SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals should be evaluated in a timely manner for neurological and psychiatic symptoms because tretament of infection-related neurological and psychiatric complications is an important factor in better prognosis of severe COVID-19 patients.From the current point of view, it seems that in COVID-19 survivors, in the coming years and decades, the inflammatory systemic process and/or the inflammatory process of the brain could trigger long-term mechanisms that generally lead to an increase of neurological and neurodegenerative disorders. Psychosocial consequences as well as consequences for mental health are also significant, both for the general population and especially for health workers of all profiles. COVID-19 pandemia is associtaed with negative psychosocial consequences, including depressive symptoms, anxiety, anger and stress, sleep disorders, simpotms of posttrauamtic stres disorder, social isolation, loneliness and stigmatization.","Sinanović, Osman; Muftić, Mirsad; Sinanović, Selma",Psychiatria Danubina,96,1

EBTs are well positioned to fill an important gap in the management of obesity and metabolic disease. The purpose of this expert review is to update gastroenterologists on these therapies and provide practice advice on how to incorporate them into clinical practice. METHODS The evidence reviewed in this work is a distillation of comprehensive search of several English-language databases and a manual review of relevant publications (including systematic reviews and meeting abstracts). Best Practice Advice 1: EBTs should be considered in patients with obesity who have been unsuccessful in losing or maintaining weight loss with lifestyle interventions. Best Practice Advice 2: EBTs can be used in patients with severe obesity as a bridge to traditional bariatric surgery. They also can be used as a bridge to allow unrelated interventions that are unable to be performed because of weight limits (ie, orthopedic surgery, organ transplantation). Best Practice Advice 3: Clinicians should use EBTs as part of a structured weight loss program that includes dietary intervention, exercise therapy, and behavior modification, in both the active weight loss phase and the long-term maintenance phase. Best Practice Advice 4: Clinicians should screen all potential EBT candidates with a comprehensive evaluation for medical conditions, comorbidities, and psychosocial or behavioral patterns that contribute to their condition before enrolling patients in a weight loss program that includes EBTs. Best Practice Advice 5: Clinicians incorporating EBTs into their clinical practice should follow up patients prospectively to capture the impact of the EBT program on weight and weight-related comorbidities, and all related adverse outcomes. Poor responders should be identified and offered a detailed evaluation and alternative therapy. Best Practice Advice 6: Clinicians embarking on incorporating EBTs into their clinical practice should have a comprehensive knowledge of the indications, contraindications, risks, benefits, and outcomes of individual EBTs, as well as a practical knowledge of the risks and benefits of alternative therapies for obesity. Best Practice Advice 7: Institutions should establish specific guidelines that are applied consistently across disciplines for granting privileges in EBTs that reflect the necessary knowledge and technical skill a clinician must achieve before being granted privileges to perform these procedures.","Abu Dayyeh, Barham K; Edmundowicz, Steven; Thompson, Chris C",Gastroenterology,96,16

A total of 23 frontline nurses who cared for patients with COVID-19 were recruited from a COVID-19-designated facility in Shanghai, China, using purposive sampling strategies. In-depth interviews were conducted from March to May 2020. Qualitative data were transcribed verbatim and content analysis was used. Nurses exhibited psychological resilience while caring for patients with COVID-19. They displayed an ability to bounce back from negative mental experiences and transform to a positive mindset to cope with the stress they faced. Factors that enhanced their resilience during the pandemic were: becoming familiar with infectious disease protocols, having a sense of professional achievement, social support, having trust in the infection-control response team in the hospital, and self-regulation. This study could guide the design of future resilience-enhancing interventions that provide positive coping strategies for nurses caring for individuals with infectious diseases during a pandemic.","Huang, Feifei; Lin, Meilian; Sun, Wenxiu; Zhang, Lin; Lu, Hongzhou; Chen, Wei-Ti",Nursing & health sciences,96,16

Here, a NAD(H)-dependent (2R,3R)-BDH from Neisseria gonorrhoeae FA1090 (NgBDH), the causative agent of gonorrhoea, was functionally characterized. Sequence analysis indicated that it belongs to zinc-containing medium-chain dehydrogenase/reductase family. The recombinant NgBDH migrated as a single band with a size of around 45 kDa on SDS-PAGE and could be confirmed by Western blotting and mass spectrometry. For the oxidation of either (2R,3R)-2,3-BD or meso-2,3-BD, the enzyme exhibited a broad pH optimum between pH 9.5 to 11.5. For the reduction of (3R/3S)-acetoin, the pH optimum was around 6.5. The enzyme could catalyze the stereospecific oxidation of (2R,3R)-2,3-BD (Km = 0.16 mM, kcat/Km = 673 s-1 · mM-1) and meso-BD (Km = 0.72 mM, kcat/Km = 165 s-1 · mM-1). Moreover, it could also reduce (3R/3S)-acetoin with a Km of 0.14 mM and a kcat/Km of 885 s-1 · mM-1. The results presented here contribute to understand the 2,3-BD metabolism in N. gonorrhoeae and pave the way for studying the influence of 2,3-BD metabolism on the virulence of this pathogen in the future.","Tang, Wanggang; Lian, Chaoqun; Si, Yu; Chang, Jianrong",Molecular biotechnology,96,27

PATIENTS AND METHODS Our study included 7 patients with prostates larger than 80 mL and with severe IPP who underwent STEP. All the procedures were performed using a home-made single-port device through a 3-cm midline incision at the level three fingerbreadths above the symphysis pubis. Rigid laparoscopic instruments and Harmonic Scalpels(®) were used to enucleate the large adenoma of the prostate. RESULTS All the procedures were completed satisfactorily, with no intra and early postoperative complications. The mean resected prostatic weight was 54.14 ± 8.38 g, and the mean operative time was 191.86 ± 40.88 min. The mean time for catheterization was 5.29 ± 1.80 days. The postoperative 3-month international prostate symptoms score (IPSS) and maximal flow rate (Qmax) were improved following STEP (IPSS; 23.57 ± 2.15 vs. 11.43 ± 2.44, Qmax; 17.14 ± 3.44 mL/s vs. 6.71 ± 2.29 mL/s). CONCLUSIONS Laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS) and enucleation of the prostate with rigid laparoscopic instruments might be difficult but is feasible.

Only few comparative studies have been conducted on different skin closure techniques, and they have shown conflicting results. Therefore, we compared different skin closure techniques during emergency cesarean section to identify the best technique with minimal wound complication rates. Methods Patients were randomized into 3 groups (group A, n=100; group B, n=102; and group C, n=98). In group A, the skin was closed using staples; in group B, via the subcuticular technique using monocryl 3-0; and in group C, using mattress suture nylon (2-0). The primary outcome was a composite of wound complications, including infection, seroma, gaping, and need for resuturing and antibiotic administration. The secondary outcome included closure time, pain perception, patient satisfaction, and cost. Analyses were performed in accordance with the intention-to-treat principle. Results The composite wound complication rate in the entire cohort was 16.6% (n=50); the complication rate was significantly higher in group A than in the other groups. Infection was the most common wound complication observed in the entire study group (86%) and was significantly higher in group A than in groups B and C (P≤0.001). Conclusion The use of staples for cesarean section skin closure is associated with an increased risk of wound complications and prolonged hospital stay postoperative visits.","Nayak G, Bhimeswar; Saha, Pradip Kumar; Bagga, Rashmi; Joshi, Bharti; Rohilla, Minakshi; Gainder, Shalini; Sikka, Pooja",Obstetrics & gynecology science,96,19

METHODS In this paper, the Spearman rank correlation test under neutrosophic statistics will be introduced. The proposed Spearman rank correlation test will be a generalization of the existing Spearman rank correlation test. RESULTS The proposed test is supposed to be more informative, flexible, and adequate to apply for the analysis of the measurement data. The application of the proposed test is given using the measurement of luteotropichormone data obtained from the clinical laboratory. Based on the information, the probability of accepting the null hypothesis H_0N is 0.95, the chance of committing a type-I error is 0.05 and the chance of indeterminacy about the acceptance of H_0N is 69%. CONCLUSIONS From the analysis, it is noted that the proposed test is more efficient in terms of the measure of indeterminacy as compared to the existing test. From the study, it is concluded that the proposed test is more informative, applicable, and useable under an indeterminate environment as compared to the existing test under classical statistics. Therefore, it is recommended to apply the proposed test in clinical laboratories for testing the correlation between instruments.","Aslam, Muhammad",Annals of clinical biochemistry,96,1

Our purpose in this study was to determine the accuracy of the FORE-SIGHT(®) (CAS Medical Systems, Branford, CT), which is calibrated to a weighted average of 70% (SjvO2) and 30% arterial saturation, for Food and Drug Administration pre-market approval 510(k) certification by adapting an industry standard protocol, ISO 9919:2005 (www.ISO.org) (used for pulse oximeters), and to evaluate the use of SctO2 and SpO2 measurements to noninvasively estimate jugular venous oxygen saturation (SnvO2). METHODS Paired blood gas samples from the radial artery and the jugular venous bulb were collected from 20 healthy volunteers undergoing progressive oxygen desaturation from 100% to 70%. The blood sample pairs were analyzed via co-oximetry and used to calculate the approximate mixed vascular cerebral blood oxygen saturation, or reference SctO2 values (refSctO2), during increasing hypoxia. These reference values were compared to bilateral FORE-SIGHT SctO2 values recorded simultaneously with the blood gas draws to determine its accuracy. Bilateral SctO2 and SpO2 measurements were then used to calculate SnvO2 values which were compared to SjvO2. RESULTS Two hundred forty-six arterial and 253 venous samples from 18 subjects were used in the analysis. The ipsilateral FORE-SIGHT SctO2 values showed a tolerance interval (TI) of [-10.72 to 10.90] and Lin concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) with standard error (SE) of 0.83 ± 0.073 with the refSctO2 values calculated using arterial and venous blood gases. The ipsilateral data had a CCC of 0.81 + 0.059 with TI of [-9.22 to 9.40] with overall bias of 0.09%, and amplitude of the root mean square of error after it was corrected with random effects analysis was 2.92%. The bias and variability values between the ipsilateral and the contralateral FORE-SIGHT SctO2 measurements varied from person to person. The SnvO2 calculated from the ipsilateral SctO2 and SpO2 data showed a CCC ± SE of 0.79 ± 0.088, TI = [-14.93 to 15.33], slope of 0.98, y-intercept of 1.14% with SjvO2 values with a bias of 0.20% and an Arms of 4.08%. The SnvO2 values calculated independently from contralateral forehead FORE-SIGHT SctO2 values were not as correlated with the SjvO2 values (contralateral side CCC + SE = 0.72 ± 0.118, TI = [-14.86 to 15.20], slope of 0.66, and y-intercept of 20.36%). CONCLUSIONS The FORE-SIGHT cerebral oximeter was able to estimate oxygen saturation within the tissues of the frontal lobe under conditions of normocapnia and varying degrees of hypoxia (with 95% confidence interval of [-5.60 to 5.78] with ipsilateral blood sample data). These findings from healthy volunteers also suggest that the use of the calculated SnvO2 derived from SctO2 and SpO2 values may be a reasonable noninvasive method of estimating SjvO2 and therefore global cerebral oxygen consumption in the clinical setting. Further laboratory and clinical research is required to define the clinical utility of near-infrared spectroscopy determination of SctO2 and SnvO2 in the operating room setting.","Ikeda, Keita; MacLeod, David B; Grocott, Hilary P; Moretti, Eugene W; Ames, Warwick; Vacchiano, Charles",Anesthesia and analgesia,96,1

This study aimed to develop a hearing-impaired version of the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination-III (HI-ACE-III) and to assess whether the HI-ACE-III can accurately distinguish people with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and dementia from cognitively intact controls. METHODS The HI-ACE-III was developed by converting verbal instructions into a visual, timed PowerPoint presentation. 74 participants over the age of 60 were classified into three groups: 29 had MCI, 15 had mild to moderate dementia and 30 cognitively intact controls. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves were graphed to test screening accuracy. Concurrent validity was examined through correlations between HI-ACE-III domain scores and relevant, visually presented standardised neuropsychological measures. RESULTS ROC analysis for dementia revealed an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.99, achieving excellent sensitivity (100%) and good specificity (93.3%) at an optimum cut-off of <87. The AUC for MCI was 0.86, achieving reasonable sensitivity (75.9%) and good specificity (86.7%) at an optimum cut-off of <92. HI-ACE-III subtests shared anticipated and statistically significant correlations with established measures of cognitive functioning. Internal consistency of the HI-ACE-III was excellent as verified with Cronbach's alpha (α = .904). CONCLUSION Preliminarily, the HI-ACE-III showed good reliability, validity and screening utility for MCI and dementia in older adults in a hearing-impairment context. The adapted HI-ACE-III may offer accurate and reliable indication of cognitive performance, supporting timely diagnosis and research examining links between hearing loss and cognitive decline.","North, Courtney; Heatley, Mary H; Utoomprurkporn, Nattawan; Bamiou, Doris Eva; Costafreda, Sergi G; Stott, Joshua",European journal of neurology,96,23

We tested the hypothesis that adjusting tidal volume (VT) to a non-injurious SI in an open lung condition avoids hypoventilation while preventing overdistension in an experimental model of combined lung injury and low chest-wall compliance (Ccw). METHODS Lung injury was induced by repeated lung lavages using warm saline solution, and Ccw was reduced by controlled intra-abdominal air-insufflation in 22 anesthetized, paralyzed and mechanically ventilated pigs. After injury animals were recruited and submitted to a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) titration trial to find the PEEP level resulting in maximum compliance. During a subsequent four hours of mechanical ventilation, VT was adjusted to keep a plateau pressure (Pplat) of 30 cmH2O (Pplat-group, n = 11) or to a SI between 0.95 and 1.05 (SI-group, n = 11). Respiratory rate was adjusted to maintain a 'normal' PaCO2 (35 to 65 mmHg). SI, lung mechanics, arterial-blood gases haemodynamics pro-inflammatory cytokines and histopathology were analyzed. In addition Computed Tomography (CT) data were acquired at end expiration and end inspiration in six animals. RESULTS PaCO2 was significantly higher in the Pplat-group (82 versus 53 mmHg, P = 0.01), with a resulting lower pH (7.19 versus 7.34, P = 0.01). We observed significant differences in VT (7.3 versus 5.4 mlKg(-1), P = 0.002) and Pplat values (30 versus 35 cmH2O, P = 0.001) between the Pplat-group and SI-group respectively. SI (1.03 versus 0.99, P = 0.42) and end-inspiratory transpulmonary pressure (PTP) (17 versus 18 cmH2O, P = 0.42) were similar in the Pplat- and SI-groups respectively, without differences in overinflated lung areas at end- inspiration in both groups. Cytokines and histopathology showed no differences. CONCLUSIONS Setting tidal volume to a non-injurious stress index in an open lung condition improves alveolar ventilation and prevents overdistension without increasing lung injury. This is in comparison with limited Pplat protective ventilation in a model of lung injury with low chest-wall compliance.","Ferrando, Carlos; Suárez-Sipmann, Fernando; Gutierrez, Andrea; Tusman, Gerardo; Carbonell, Jose; García, Marisa; Piqueras, Laura; Compañ, Desamparados; Flores, Susanie; Soro, Marina; Llombart, Alicia; Belda, Francisco Javier",Critical care,96,1

Formal CACN letters to state regulators did not affect change. While California nursing education regulations require 75% direct patient contact for all clinical courses, meeting this requirement became impossible as clinical agencies closed to nursing students during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Nursing regulatory change was urgently needed to provide greater flexibility in meeting clinical course objectives using simulation and other online learning modalities. At stake was the graduation of over 14,971 RN students from public and private nursing programs. While state regulators opposed a legislative approach, CACN collaborated with stakeholders to support legislation that led to a reduction in direct patient care hours, allowing nursing students to progress and graduate. This longstanding advocacy work was accelerated by the pandemic and required leadership and knowledge about the legislative process for nurse educators to succeed. The ultimate goal for CACN is to forge a more respectful relationship and greater collaboration between educators and regulators to enhance quality, reduce costs, and redundancies in nursing education in this state.","Ziehm, Scott R; Nelson, Robyn; Greiner, Philip A; Wickman, Mary; Weismuller, Penny C; Lightfoot, Karin L; Ruggenberg, Shana",Journal of professional nursing : official journal of the American Association of Colleges of Nursing,96,26

While this statement has widely been used to approximate quantum dynamics in various contexts, a general and quantitative justification stays lacking. Here we establish an observable-based error bound for such a constrained-dynamics approximation in generic gapped quantum systems. This universal bound is a linear function of time that only involves the energy gap and coupling strength, provided that the latter is much smaller than the former. We demonstrate that either the intercept or the slope in the bound is asymptotically saturable by simple models. We generalize the result to quantum many-body systems with local interactions, for which the coupling strength diverges in the thermodynamic limit while the error is found to grow no faster than a power law t^{d+1} in d dimensions. Our work establishes a universal and rigorous result concerning nonequilibrium quantum dynamics.","Gong, Zongping; Yoshioka, Nobuyuki; Shibata, Naoyuki; Hamazaki, Ryusuke",Physical review letters,96,31

The new confirmed cases of infected individuals of COVID-19 are increasing day by day. Therefore, the prediction of infected individuals has become of utmost important for health care arrangements and to control the spread of COVID-19. In this study, we propose a compartmental epidemic model with intervention strategies such as lockdown, quarantine, and hospitalization. We compute the basic reproduction number (R0), which plays a vital role in mathematical epidemiology. Based on R0, it is revealed that the system has two equilibrium, namely disease-free and endemic. We also demonstrate the non-negativity and boundedness of the solutions, local and global stability of equilibria, transcritical bifurcation to analyze its epidemiological relevance. Furthermore, to validate our system, we fit the cumulative and new daily cases in India. We estimate the model parameters and predict the near future scenario of the disease. The global sensitivity analysis has also been performed to observe the impact of different parameters on R0. We also investigate the dynamics of disease in respect of different situations of lockdown, e.g., complete lockdown, partial lockdown, and no lockdown. Our analysis concludes that if there is partial or no lockdown case, then endemic level would be high. Along with this, the high transmission rate ensures higher level of endemicity. From the short time prediction, we predict that India may face a crucial phase (approx 6000000 infected individuals within 140 days) in near future due to COVID-19. Finally, numerical results show that COVID-19 may be controllable by reducing the contacts and increasing the efficacy of lockdown.","Bugalia, Sarita; Bajiya, Vijay Pal; Tripathi, Jai Prakash; Li, Ming-Tao; Sun, Gui-Quan",Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE,96,19

This has created a large backlog of work and upstaging of disease with consequent increases in risk and cost of treatment and potential for worse long-term outcomes. As countries emerge from lockdown but with COVID-19 endemic in society, precautions remain that restrict 'normal' practice. In this article, we propose a methodology for restructuring services for patients with HVD and provide recommendations pertaining to frequency of follow-up and use of echocardiography at present. It will be almost impossible to practice exactly as we did prior to the pandemic; thus, it is essential to prioritise patients with the greatest clinical need, such as those with symptomatic severe HVD. Local procedural waiting times will need to be considered, in addition to usual clinical characteristics in determining whether patients requiring intervention would be better suited having surgical or transcatheter treatment. We present guidance on the identification of stable patients with HVD that could have follow-up deferred safely and suggest certain patients that could be discharged from follow-up if waiting lists are triaged with appropriate clinical input. Finally, we propose that novel models of working enforced by the pandemic-such as increased use of virtual clinics-should be further developed and evaluated.","Shah, Benoy Nalin; Schlosshan, Dominik; McConkey, Hannah Zelie Ruth; Buch, Mamta Heena; Marshall, Andrew John; Cartwright, Neil; Dobson, Laura Elizabeth; Allen, Christopher; Campbell, Brian; Khan, Patricia; Savill, Peter John; Briffa, Norman Paul; Chambers, John Boyd",Heart,96,1

It named COVID-19, and to date, thousands of cases of infection and death reported worldwide. The disease is associated with a wide range of symptoms that make it difficult to diagnose it accurately. The previous SARS pandemic in 2003, researchers found that the patients with fever, cough, or sore throat had a 5% influenza virus-positive rate. This finding sparked in our minds that the wide range of symptoms and also relatively high prevalence of death in our patients may be due to the co-infection with other viruses. Thus, we evaluate the co-infection of SARS-CoV-2 with other respiratory viruses in dead patients in North Khorasan. We evaluated the presence of influenza A/B virus, Human metapneumovirus, bocavirus, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and parainfluenza viruses in 105 SARS-CoV-2 positive dead patients, using PCR and RT-PCR tests. We found co-infection with influenza virus in 22.3%, respiratory syncytial virus, and bocavirus in 9.7%, parainfluenza viruses in 3.9%, Human metapneumovirus in 2.9% and finally adenovirus in 1.9% of SARS-CoV-2 positive dead cases. The highlights of our findings are a high prevalence of co-infection with influenza A virus and the monopoly of co-infection with Human metapneumovirus in children.

To improve communication between healthcare staff of signs and symptoms of infection we developed an instrument, using qualitative data from observations by nursing assistants when they suspected infection. The aim of this study was to assess the validity of nursing assistants observations by developing and testing the instrument for early detection of infection in elderly nursing home residents. METHODS The early detection of infection (EDIS) instrument was based on data from focus interviews with nursing assistants. Over one year the nursing assistants used EDIS to document episodes of suspected early signs and symptoms of infection in 204 nursing home residents. Two physicians classified documented episodes as ""no infection"", ""possible infection"", and ""infection"". The content validity of the 13 items of the EDIS was established to explore the relationships between the items. The construct validity was used to explore the relationship between the items and the presence or absence of infection. The predictive value of the developed model was evaluated by the percentage of correct classifications of the observed cases. Generalized linear model (ordinal multinomial distribution and logit link) was used. RESULTS Of the 388 events of suspected infection, 20 % were assessed as no infection, 31 % as possible infection and 49 % as infection. Content validity analysis showed that 12/13 of the items correlated significantly with at least one other statement. The range in number of significant inter-correlations was from 0 (""pain"") to 8 (""general signs and symptoms of illness""). The construct validity showed that the items ""temperature"" , ""respiratory symptoms"" and ""general signs and symptoms of illness"" were significantly related to ""infection"", and these were also selected in the model-building. These items predicted correct alternative responses in 61 % of the cases. CONCLUSION The validation of EDIS suggests that the observation of ""general signs and symptoms of illness"", made by nursing assistants should be taken seriously in detecting early infection in frail elderly. Also, the statement ""He/She is not as usual"" should lead to follow-up.","Tingström, P; Milberg, A; Rodhe, N; Ernerud, J; Grodzinsky, E; Sund-Levander, M",BMC geriatrics,96,29

PURPOSE To compare the effects of 2 lateral MAT fixation techniques-bone block and suture only-on knee kinematics and forces. STUDY DESIGN Controlled laboratory study. METHODS With a robotic testing system, loads were applied during flexion on 10 fresh-frozen cadaveric knees: 134-N anterior tibial load + 200-N axial compression, 5-N·m internal tibial + 5-N·m valgus torques, and 5-N·m external tibial + 5-N·m valgus torques. Kinematic data were recorded for 4 knee states: intact, total lateral meniscectomy, lateral MAT bone block, and lateral MAT suture-only fixation. In situ force in the anterior cruciate ligament and resultant forces in the lateral meniscus and in the meniscal allograft were quantified via the principle of superposition. A repeated measures analysis of variance was used to analyze variations in kinematics and forces at 0°, 30°, 60°, and 90° of knee flexion. Significance was set at P < .05. RESULTS When anterior loads were applied, a decrease in medial translation of the tibia that was increased after total lateral meniscectomy was observed at 30°, 60°, and 90° of knee flexion for both the lateral MAT bone block (54.2%, 48.0%, and 50.0%) and the MAT suture-only (50.0%, 40.0%, and 34.6%) fixation techniques (P < .05). Yet, most of the increases in knee kinematics after lateral meniscectomy were not significantly reduced by either lateral MAT technique (P > .05 for each MAT technique vs the total lateral meniscectomy state). Resultant forces in the meniscal allograft were 50% to 60% of the resultant forces in the intact lateral meniscus in response to all loading conditions at all flexion angles (P < .05). Overall, no significant differences between lateral MAT techniques were observed regarding kinematics and forces (P > .05). CONCLUSION Lateral MAT partially restored medial translation of the tibia, and the resultant forces in the meniscal allograft were only 50% to 60% of the intact lateral meniscus forces in the cadaver model. In the majority of testing conditions, no significant changes of the in situ force in the anterior cruciate ligament were observed. Surgeons should consider the potential benefits of lateral MAT when deciding the appropriate treatment for symptomatic patients after lateral meniscectomies. Both lateral MAT techniques functioned similarly. CLINICAL RELEVANCE The load-bearing function of the meniscal allograft observed in this study may be beneficial in ameliorating the short- and long-term disability associated with lateral meniscal deficiency.","Novaretti, João V; Lian, Jayson; Sheean, Andrew J; Chan, Calvin K; Wang, Joon H; Cohen, Moises; Debski, Richard E; Musahl, Volker",The American journal of sports medicine,96,25

We aimed to assess the current state of the art and the adequacy of preliminary oncological results. METHODS We performed a systematic review of the literature using Pubmed, Medline, SCOPUS and Web of Science databases. Keywords used were ""Single Port"" or ""Single-Incision"" or ""LaparoEndoscopic Single Site"" or ""SILS™"" and ""Colon"" or ""Colorectal"" and ""Surgery"". RESULTS Twenty-nine articles on colorectal MISS surgery have been published from July 2008 to July 2010, presenting data on 149 patients. One study reported analgesic requirement. The final incision length ranged from 2.5 to 8 cm. Only two studies reported fascial incision length. There were two port site hernias in a series of 13 patients (15.38%). Two ""fully laparoscopic"" MISS procedures with preparation and achievement of the anastomosis completely intracorporeally are reported. Future site of ileostomy was used as the sole access for the procedures in three studies. Lymph node harvesting, resection margins and length of specimen were sufficient in oncological cases. CONCLUSIONS MISS colorectal surgery is a challenging procedure that seems to be safe and feasible, but the existing clinical evidence is limited. In selected cases, and especially when an ileostomy is planned, colorectal surgery may be an ideal indication for MISS surgery leading to a no-scar surgery. Despite preliminary oncological results showing the feasibility of MISS surgery, we want to stress the need to standardize the technique and carefully evaluate its application in oncosurgery under ethical committee control.","Diana, Michele; Dhumane, Parag; Cahill, R A; Mortensen, N; Leroy, Joel; Marescaux, Jacques",Journal of minimal access surgery,96,31

Largely because of limited temporal resolution, reconstruction of time-resolved CT angiography (CTA) from these systems has not yielded satisfactory results. We evaluated the image quality and diagnostic value of time-resolved C-arm CTA reconstructed using novel image processing algorithms. METHODS Studies were done under an Institutional Review Board approved protocol. Postprocessing of data from 21 C-arm CT dynamic perfusion acquisitions from 17 patients with acute ischemic stroke were done to derive time-resolved C-arm CTA images. Two observers independently evaluated image quality and diagnostic content for each case. ICC and receiver-operating characteristic analysis were performed to evaluate interobserver agreement and diagnostic value of this novel imaging modality. RESULTS Time-resolved C-arm CTA images were successfully generated from 20 data sets (95.2%, 20/21). Two observers agreed well that the image quality for large cerebral arteries was good but was more limited for small cerebral arteries (distal to M1, A1, and P1). receiver-operating characteristic curves demonstrated excellent diagnostic value for detecting large vessel occlusions (area under the curve=0.987-1). CONCLUSIONS Time-resolved CTAs derived from C-arm CT perfusion acquisitions provide high quality images that allowed accurate diagnosis of large vessel occlusions. Although image quality of smaller arteries in this study was not optimal ongoing modifications of the postprocessing algorithm will likely remove this limitation. Adding time-resolved C-arm CTAs to the capabilities of the angiography suite further enhances its suitability as a one-stop shop for care for patients with acute ischemic stroke.","Yang, Pengfei; Niu, Kai; Wu, Yijing; Struffert, Tobias; Dorfler, Arnd; Schafer, Sebastian; Royalty, Kevin; Strother, Charles; Chen, Guang-Hong",Stroke,96,30

To our knowledge, no trials have yet been performed comparing these regimens head to head. We performed a network meta-analysis comparing the efficacy of NCCN-recommended chemotherapy regimens. METHODS We searched Medline, Embase, Web of Science, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform from inception to February 2020. We included randomized clinical trials comparing adjuvant regimens in predominantly node-positive operable breast cancer patients. We compared (1) DDACT, (2) TCx4 cycles, (3) TAC, and (4) ACWKT. Common comparators were (5) AC, (6) ACT, and (7) ACD. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. The Cochrane risk of bias tool assessed quality of the studies. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated as measures of treatment effects with AC as reference. We used Bayesian hierarchical random-effects models with noninformative priors for mixed multiple treatment comparisons. Effectiveness was estimated by disease-free and overall survival using ORs. Sensitivity analyses were performed. Safety outcomes included febrile neutropenia. RESULTS We identified 7 randomized controlled trials with 16,332 patients. TC (odds ratio [95% confidence interval], 0.71 [0.36-1.40]), TAC (0.77 [0.37-1.57]), ACWKT (0.68 [0.34-1.38]), and DDACT (0.72 [0.35-1.42]) were similar for overall survival.

Measurement of dietary intake usually relies on self-report, subject to multiple biases. There is a need to understand gender differences in the self-report of dietary intake and the implications of any differences in targeting nutrition interventions. Literature in this area is limited and it is currently unknown whether self-report dietary assessment methods are equally accurate for women and men. The aim of this systematic review is to determine whether there are differences by gender in reporting energy intake compared with a reference measure of total energy expenditure. METHODS AND ANALYSIS A comprehensive search of published original research studies will be performed in MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, EMBASE, CINAHL and Cochrane library. Original research studies will be included if they were conducted in free-living/unhospitalised adults and included a measure for both women and men of (a) self-reported energy intake and (b) total energy expenditure by doubly labelled water.

Whether or not the virus was present in Italy earlier the first autochthonous COVID-19 case was diagnosed is still uncertain. We aimed to identify anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in sera collected from 4th November 2019 to 9th March 2020, in order to assess the possible spread of the virus in Italy earlier than the first official national diagnosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were evaluated in retrospective serum samples from 234 patients with liver diseases (Hep-patients) and from 56 blood donors (BDs). We used two rapid serologic tests which were confirmed by a validated chemoluminescence assay. RESULTS Via rapid tests, we found 10/234 (4.3%) IgG-positive and 1/234 (0.4%) IgM-positive cases in the Hep-patient group. Two/56 (3.6%) IgG-positive and 2/56 (3.6%) IgM-positive cases were detected in BD group. Chemoluminescence confirmed IgG-positivity in 3 Hep-patients and 1 BD and IgM-positivity in 1 Hep-patient. RNAemia was not detected in any of the subjects, rendering the risk of transfusion transmission negligible.

MATERIAL AND METHODS A cross-sectional prospective study was conducted in tertiary hospitals in the Uusimaa region, Finland, with 1072 volunteers being enrolled in the study from among the HCWs at the Helsinki University Hospital. Overall, 866 (80.8%) HCWs (including 588 nurses, 170 doctors, and 108 laboratory and medical imaging nurses) completed the questionnaire by July 15, 2020, with 52% of the participants taking care of COVID‑19 patients. The participants answered a structured questionnaire regarding their use of PPE, the ability to follow safety guidelines, exposure to COVID‑19, and the source of potential COVID‑19 infections. The participants with COVID‑19 symptoms were tested with the SARS-CoV-2 realtime polymerase chain reaction method. All infected participants were contacted, and their answers were confirmed regarding COVID‑19 exposure. RESULTS In total, 41 (4.7%) participants tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, with 22 (53.6%) of infections being confirmed or likely occupational, and 12 (29.3%) originating from colleagues. In 14 cases (63.6%), occupational infections occurred while using a surgical mask, and all infections originating from patients occurred while using a surgical mask or no mask at all. No occupational infections were found while using an FFP2/3 respirator and following aerosol precautions.

We introduced an intrathoracic esophagogastric anastomosis using linear staplers. TECHNIQUE The lower mediastinal dissection and the gastric tube construction are done in the laparoscopic part of the operation. The esophagus is transected at the cranial level of the aortic arch after the completion of the upper mediastinal lymph node dissection in the prone position. The excess length of the gastric tube is sacrificed before making the anastomosis. Side-to-side esophagogastric anastomosis is performed using a 35-mm endoscopic linear stapler. The entry hole is closed with hand suturing using the posterior and the axillary port. RESULTS Twenty-six patients with middle or lower esophageal tumor underwent MIE with an intrathoracic anastomosis. The mean thoracoscopic procedure time was 302 min. One patient had an anastomotic leakage, which was successfully managed with drainage. There has been no anastomotic stenosis. Pneumonia was observed in two patients. There was no mortality. CONCLUSIONS MIE with an intrathoracic linear-stapled anastomosis with the patient in the prone position is safe and feasible.","Okabe, Hiroshi; Tanaka, Eiji; Tsunoda, Shigeru; Obama, Kazutaka; Sakai, Yoshiharu",Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,96,17

It presents a number of challenges to the primary care physician and particularly if the clinical examination and routine investigations are normal. However, while fatigue is a feature of many common illnesses, it is the main problem in Chronic Fatigue Syndrome/Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME). This is a poorly understood condition that is accompanied by several additional symptoms which suggest a subtle multisystem dysfunction. Not infrequently it is complicated by sleep disturbance and alterations in attention, memory and mood.Specialised services for the diagnosis and management of CFS/ME are markedly deficient in the UK and indeed in virtually all countries around the world. However, unexplained fatigue and CFS/ME may be confidently diagnosed on the basis of specific clinical criteria combined with the normality of routine blood tests. The latter include those that assess inflammation, autoimmunity, endocrine dysfunction and gluten sensitivity. Early diagnosis and intervention in general practice will do much to reduce patient anxiety, encourage improvement and prevent expensive unnecessary investigations.There is presently an on-going debate as to the precise criteria that best confirms CFS/ME to the exclusion of other medical and psychiatric/psychological causes of chronic fatigue. There is also some disagreement as to best means of investigating and managing this very challenging condition. Uncertainty here can contribute to patient stress which in some individuals can perpetuate and aggravate symptoms. A simple clinical scoring system and a short list of routine investigations should help discriminate CFS/ME from other causes of continued fatigue.","Bansal, Amolak S",BMC family practice,96,10

METHODS Graduate nursing students (n = 222) completed the survey, which included 2 instruments: the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) and the Impact of Events Scale (IES-R). RESULTS Nearly 25% of students expressed moderate to extremely severe levels of negative emotional states on the DASS-21, and 23.8% of students scored within the area of clinical concern for the presence of posttraumatic stress disorder on the IES-R.

The study is an updated meta-analysis to evaluate the association between NAFLD and impaired lung function. METHODS A total of 696 articles were identified with mention of NAFLD and lung function (or pulmonary function testing) in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Scopus. After de-duplication, 455 articles were screened, 18 underwent full-text review. Five studies met our review and inclusion criteria with an interrater reliability kappa score of 1. RESULTS Five studies with a total of 118 118 subjects (28.4% with NAFLD) were included. The cross-sectional studies supported a statistically significant relationship between decreased pulmonary function tests and NAFLD. There was no association observed with obstructive lung pattern. One of the longitudinal studies revealed an association with increased rate of decline in forced vital capacity in patients with NAFLD and FIB4 score ≥1.30 (-21.7 vs. -27.4 mL/year, P = 0.001 in males, -22.4 vs. -27.9 mL/year, P = 0.016 in females). The second longitudinal study revealed that patients with impaired pulmonary function had an increased hazard ratio of developing NAFLD dependent on the severity of pulmonary impairment. CONCLUSIONS This is the first systematic review that supports an association of NAFLD with decreased (restrictive) lung function. The estimated severity of liver fibrosis correlates with the rate of progression of restrictive lung function. There are also data showing that patients with impaired lung function have a higher risk of developing NAFLD.","Wu, Yi Chai; Chuang, Philip M; Pinotti, Rachel; Nagirimadugu, Ankita; Valentin, Nelson; Dinani, Amreen",European journal of gastroenterology & hepatology,96,1

Little is known about the alveolar pressures, lung volumes, and expiratory flow rates generated by the MIE when used via tracheostomy tube in infants and children. METHODS A high-fidelity mechanical lung model was programmed to simulate infants with tracheostomy tubes. Generated pressures, volumes, and expiratory flows using the MIE device at variable insufflation/exsufflation pressures and times were recorded. The primary measure of interest was maximal expiratory flow (MEF). RESULTS Pressure equilibration across the tracheostomy tube did not occur with insufflation time <1 sec. Longer insufflation time significantly increased measured alveolar pressures, lung volume, and MEF until TLC was reached. Longer exsufflation time did not significantly increase MEF. Higher insufflation pressures resulted in greater lung volumes, with >70% vital capacity attained at insufflation pressures as low as 20 cmH2 O. Though higher insufflation pressures resulted in increased expiratory flow rates, more negative exsufflation pressure had a greater absolute impact on MEF. CONCLUSIONS Using the MIE via tracheostomy tube in an infant lung model, we found that an insufflation time of >1 sec is required for equilibration of insufflation pressure and alveolar pressure. Longer exsufflation time does not significantly alter MEF. Higher insufflation and exsufflation pressures both increased MEF, but greater exsufflation pressure had more substantial impact.","Striegl, Amanda M; Redding, Gregory J; Diblasi, Robert; Crotwell, Dave; Salyer, John; Carter, Edward R",Pediatric pulmonology,96,1

In this study, sequence-independent amplification and high-throughput sequencing (Solexa) were applied to the metagenomic analysis of viruses in bat fecal samples collected from 6 locations in China. A total of 8,746,417 reads with a length of 306,124,595 bp were obtained. Among these reads, 13,541 (0.15%) had similarity to phage sequences and 9,170 (0.1%) had similarity to eukaryotic virus sequences. A total of 129 assembled contigs (>100 nucleotides) were constructed and compared with GenBank: 32 contigs were related to phages, and 97 were related to eukaryotic viruses. The most frequent reads and contigs related to eukaryotic viruses were homologous to densoviruses, dicistroviruses, coronaviruses, parvoviruses, and tobamoviruses, a range that includes viruses from invertebrates, vertebrates, and plants. Most of the contigs had low identities to known viral genomic or protein sequences, suggesting that a large number of novel and genetically diverse insect viruses as well as putative mammalian viruses are transmitted by bats in China. This study provides the first preliminary understanding of the virome of some bat populations in China, which may guide the discovery and isolation of novel viruses in the future.","Ge, Xingyi; Li, Yan; Yang, Xinglou; Zhang, Huajun; Zhou, Peng; Zhang, Yunzhi; Shi, Zhengli",Journal of virology,96,1

Astrovirus, rotavirus, and reovirus were detected alone or in various combinations in both LTS and non-LTS flocks. No coronavirus was detected in LTS flocks and no corona- or reovirus was detected in non-LTS flocks. In the second study, 2-week-old turkey poults were divided into two groups; Group A (challenged) was inoculated orally with 10% pooled faecal suspension from LTS flocks and group B (control) was inoculated with phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Clinical signs of depression, huddling, and lack of uniform size were observed in the challenged group but not in the control group. diarrhoea was observed in both groups but was more severe in the challenged group than in the control group. Birds in the challenged group shed astrovirus, rotavirus and reovirus, while the control group shed only astrovirus. Virus shedding in both groups was observed for up to nine weeks of age. Significantly lower body weights were seen in the challenged group starting at seven weeks of age and lasting until 20 weeks of age. These findings suggest that viral enteritis at an early age may set up conditions for the development of LTS in adult turkeys.","Mor, Sunil K; Sharafeldin, Tamer A; Abin, Martha; Kromm, Michelle; Porter, Robert E; Goyal, Sagar M; Patnayak, Devi P",Avian pathology : journal of the W.V.P.A,96,1

With the continuous exploration of the types of programmed cell death, an increasing number of studies have confirmed that caspase-8 plays an important role in cancer. Recently, scholars have proposed the term ""PANoptosis"", which mainly includes three programmed cell death modes, namely pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis. In addition to mediating endogenous apoptotic pathways, caspase-8 can also participate in the cleavage of gasdermin (GSDM) family proteins to induce pyroptosis. Furthermore, the expression of enzymatically inactive caspase-8 (C362S) can cause embryonic lethality and inflammatory tissue destruction in mice by inducing necroptosis and pyroptosis. Therefore, the activation and deletion of caspase-8 enzyme activity, as well as the knockout of the coding gene, are closely related to ""PANoptosis"". In addition, caspase-8 can also improve the tumor microenvironment and enhance tumor anti-immunity. Studies have shown that caspase-8 is also associated with tumor growth and invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis, therapeutic resistance, and poor clinical outcomes. Therefore, it is very important to measure the cancer-promoting and anti-cancer effects of caspase-8 and find a balance, and to study its role in the effect of ""PANoptosis"" in depth.

Thrombectomy with the use of a stent retriever, in addition to intravenous t-PA, increases reperfusion rates and may improve long-term functional outcome. METHODS We randomly assigned eligible patients with stroke who were receiving or had received intravenous t-PA to continue with t-PA alone (control group) or to undergo endovascular thrombectomy with the use of a stent retriever within 6 hours after symptom onset (intervention group). Patients had confirmed occlusions in the proximal anterior intracranial circulation and an absence of large ischemic-core lesions. The primary outcome was the severity of global disability at 90 days, as assessed by means of the modified Rankin scale (with scores ranging from 0 [no symptoms] to 6 [death]). RESULTS The study was stopped early because of efficacy. At 39 centers, 196 patients underwent randomization (98 patients in each group). In the intervention group, the median time from qualifying imaging to groin puncture was 57 minutes, and the rate of substantial reperfusion at the end of the procedure was 88%. Thrombectomy with the stent retriever plus intravenous t-PA reduced disability at 90 days over the entire range of scores on the modified Rankin scale (P<0.001). The rate of functional independence (modified Rankin scale score, 0 to 2) was higher in the intervention group than in the control group (60% vs. 35%, P<0.001).

We aimed to evaluate the feasibility, efficacy, and safety of the LVIS device for treating vertebral and basilar artery aneurysms. METHODS Between January 2015 and December 2017, patients with vertebral and basilar artery aneurysms treated using LVIS stents were enrolled in this study. We analyzed patients' demographic, clinical and aneurysmal characteristics, procedural details, complications, and angiographic and clinical follow-up results. RESULTS We identified 63 patients with 64 vertebral and basilar artery aneurysms who underwent treatment with (n = 59) or without (n = 5) LVIS stenting, including 10 patients with ruptured aneurysms. Forty-one aneurysms were located at the vertebral artery, and 23 at the basilar artery. Intraprocedural-related complications developed in three (4.8%) patients, while none of these patients developed morbidities or died during follow-up. Three patients developed post-procedural complications (4.8%). Two patients experienced ischemic events immediately post-procedure. A minor permanent morbidity developed in one of the two patients (1.6%). The mortality rate was 1.6%, for that the patient died of brainstem hemorrhage after 1 month of follow-up. At a mean follow-up of 12.5 months, 39/43 (90.7%) patients had stable or improved aneurysms, and four (9.3%) had recanalized.

The US Food and Drug Administration approved its use in certain types of infections among pediatric patients, and yet there have been mixed data about its efficacy and safety in this population. Objective The objective of this review is to compare efficacy and all-cause mortality of cefepime to other clinically indicated antibiotics among children. Methods We conducted a systematic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, LILACS, and clinicaltrials.gov databases through February 8, 2016. We included randomized controlled trials comparing cefepime to other clinical antibiotics, placebo, or no treatment in children aged 0-19 years in the inpatient setting with clinical signs of infection. The primary outcome of interest was all-cause mortality. The secondary outcomes were success rate, treatment failure, and incidence of adverse events. Study quality was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tool. Results Seventeen studies met the inclusion criteria. There was a total of 1,285 participants included, 624 participants in the cefepime arm and 661 in the comparison arm. A random effects meta-analysis for all-cause mortality showed no difference in rates of mortality between cefepime and comparator antibiotics with a mortality risk ratio of 0.88 (95% CI: 0.71-1.08).

It is well accepted that heterotypic cellular interactions impact the phenotype of cardiomyocytes. The current study evaluates the functional effects of coculturing adult human cardiac fibroblasts (hCFs) in 3D engineered tissues on excitation and contraction with the goal of recapitulating healthy, nonarrhythmogenic myocardium in vitro. A small population (5% of total cell number) of hCFs in tissues improves tissue formation, material properties, and contractile function. However, two perturbations to the hCF population create disease-like phenotypes in engineered cardiac tissues. First, increasing the percentage of hCFs to 15% resulted in tissues with increased ectopic activity and spontaneous excitation rate. Second, hCFs undergo myofibroblast activation in traditional two-dimensional culture, and this altered phenotype ablated the functional benefits of hCFs when incorporated into engineered cardiac tissues. Taken together, the results of this study demonstrate that human cardiac fibroblast number and activation state modulate electromechanical function of hiPSC-cardiomyocytes and that a low percentage of quiescent hCFs are a valuable cell source to advance a healthy electromechanical response of engineered cardiac tissue for regenerative medicine applications.","Rupert, Cassady E; Kim, Tae Yun; Choi, Bum-Rak; Coulombe, Kareen L K",Stem cells international,96,31

Although omega-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA), and particularly docosahexanoic acid (DHA), are considered of particular importance, results from clinical trials with preterm infants have been inconclusive because of ethical limitations and confounding variables. A translational large animal model is needed to understand the structural and functional responses to DHA. Neurodevelopment of preterm pigs was evaluated in response to feeding formulas to term-equivalent age supplemented with DHA attached to phosphatidylserine (PS-DHA) or sunflower oil as the placebo. Newborn term pigs were used as a control for normal in utero neurodevelopment. Supplementing formula with PS-DHA increased weight of the brain, and particularly the cerebellum, at term-equivalent age compared with placebo preterm pigs (P's < 0.10 and 0.05 respectively), with a higher degree of myelination in all regions of the brain examined (all p < 0.06). Brains of pigs provided PS-DHA were similar in weight to newborn term pigs. Event-related brain potentials and performance in a novel object recognition test indicated the PS-DHA supplement accelerated development of sensory pathways and recognition memory compared with placebo preterm pigs. The PS-DHA did not increase weight gain, but was associated with higher survival. The benefits of PS-DHA include improving neurodevelopment and possibly improvement of survival, and justify further studies to define dose-response relations, compare benefits associated with other sources of DHA, and understand the mechanisms underlying the benefits and influences on the development of other tissues and organ systems.","Buddington, Randal K; Chizhikov, Victor V; Iskusnykh, Igor Y; Sable, Helen J; Sable, Jeffrey J; Holloway, Zade R; Blumenfeld Katzir, Tamar; van der Merwe, Marie; Yakimkova, Taisiya; Buddington, Karyl K; Lifshitz, Yael; Tessler, Shoshi; Gilbert, Ariel",Nutrients,96,31

This study was performed to examine the outcome of CAS with an open-cell stent and double-balloon protection for unstable plaques. METHODS A total of 184 CAS procedures in our institute between October 2010 and February 2018 were assessed. Ultrasonography findings of low-echo plaques, plaque ulceration, or both were defined as unstable plaques. A plaque-to-muscle ratio (PMR) of >1.8 on T1-weighted black blood imaging using spin-echo was also defined as an unstable plaque. Seventy-four unstable plaques on ultrasonography and 86 unstable plaques evaluated by PMR were included. Open-cell stents and double-balloon protection (proximal balloon protection during lesion crossing and distal balloon protection after lesion crossing) were used in all cases. RESULTS On ultrasonography, perioperative asymptomatic thromboembolization was significantly more frequent in the unstable plaque group (39/74, 52.7%) than in the stable plaque group (41/110, 37.3%, p=0.0384). Asymptomatic thromboembolization was also significantly more frequent in the PMR >1.8 group (44/86, 51.2%) than in the PMR <1.8 group (36/98, 36.7%, p=0.0489). However, symptomatic thromboembolization was rare (n=5, 2.7%), and all of these patients had minor stroke. During the 4-year follow-up, the risk of ipsilateral stroke was 0.28% and 0.27% per year in patients with symptomatic and asymptomatic lesions, respectively. CONCLUSIONS The outcomes of CAS with an open-cell stent and double-balloon protection are acceptable. This method is effective and safe, even if carotid artery stenosis comprises unstable plaques.","Funakoshi, Yusuke; Imamura, Hirotoshi; Tani, Shoichi; Adachi, Hidemitsu; Fukumitsu, Ryu; Sunohara, Tadashi; Omura, Yoshihiro; Matsui, Yuichi; Sasaki, Natsuhi; Fukuda, Tatsumaru; Akiyama, Ryo; Horiuchi, Kazufumi; Kajiura, Shinji; Shigeyasu, Masashi; Iihara, Koji; Sakai, Nobuyuki",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,96,31

AIM To compare LESS AE with standard laparoscopic AE (SLAE). MATERIAL AND METHODS Between 3/2012 and 7/2014, 35 adrenalectomies were performed. In 18 (51.4%), a LESS approach was chosen. Indications were strictly non-complicated cases (body mass index (BMI) < 34 kg/m(2), tumour ≤ 7 cm, non-malignant aetiology, no previous surgery). All LESS procedures were done by one surgeon. Standard equipment was a 10 mm rigid 0° camera, Triport+, one pre-bent grasper, and a sealing instrument. The approach was pararectal in all cases except one (transumbilical in a slim man). Three patients with LESS were excluded (2 partial AEs only, one adrenal cancer converted to SLAE and then to open surgery). These 15 LESS AE procedures were compared to 15 SLAEs with similar characteristics chosen among 54 SLAEs performed in the period 1/2008-2/2012. RESULTS In 8 cases (53.3%) of LESS AE, a 3 mm port was added to elevate the liver/spleen. Mean parameters of LESS AE vs. SLAE (Wilcoxon test): maximal tumour diameter 43.7 mm vs. 36.1 mm (p = 0.28), time of surgery 63.3 min vs. 55.3 min (p = 0.22), blood loss 38.0 ml vs. 38.0 ml (p = 0.38), BMI 26.9 kg/m(2) vs. 28.5 kg/m(2) (p = 0.13), discharge from hospital 5.4 days vs. 3.9 days (p = 0.038). There were no complications in either group. CONCLUSIONS The LESS AE is feasible in selected cases, especially small left-sided tumours in thin patients with no history of previous abdominal operations, but requires an additional port in half of the cases.","Hora, Milan; Ürge, Tomáš; Stránský, Petr; Trávníček, Ivan; Pitra, Tomáš; Kalusová, Kristýna; Dolejšová, Olga; Petersson, Fredrik; Krčma, Michal; Chlosta, Piotr",Wideochirurgia i inne techniki maloinwazyjne = Videosurgery and other miniinvasive techniques,96,1

Increased loneliness and social isolation are associated with adverse health outcomes, yet there is a gap in brief interventions that specifically target loneliness. This article introduces a brief intervention to strengthen connectedness, LOVE. In a systematic way, this solution-focused approach encourages openness and sharing of current struggles with the existing circle of support. There are four steps in LOVE: List people in one's life, Organise them on the helpfulness-availability matrix, Verify what they know to map them onto circles of trust and Engage them through self-disclosure. CONCLUSION The article details each concept, its importance, the pragmatics involved and top tips to guide practice. The memorable acronym provides logical sequence and structure. It is time efficient in training and delivery, with no former mental health knowledge required so there is potential for wide application. It facilitates collaboration between health professionals and people in distress and promotes empowerment and self-resilience. Adapted from the safety planning component of PROTECT, a pre-existing suicide prevention framework, LOVE has to be fine-tuned as a brief intervention in the wider context of the pandemic.","Ray, Manaan Kar; Chow, Ka Ki; Theodoros, Theo; Wyder, Marianne; Steginga, Anne; Sorrensen, Rosemary; Hickey, Paul; Lau, Geoff; Kinsella, Kieran; Lombardo, Chiara",Australasian psychiatry : bulletin of Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists,96,16

In this work, in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of local drug delivery was performed to visualize and quantify the time resolved distribution of MRI contrast agents. Three-dimensional T1 maps (generated from T1-weighted images with varied TR) were processed using noise-reducing filtering. A segmented region of contrast, from a thresholded image, was converted to concentration maps using the equation 1/T1=1/T1,0+R1C, where T1,0 and T1 are the precontrast and postcontrast T1 map values, respectively. In this technique, a uniform estimated value for T 1,0 was used. Error estimations were performed for each step. The practical usefulness of this method was assessed using comparisons between devices located in different locations both with and without contrast. The method using a uniform T1,0, requiring no registration of pre- and postcontrast image volumes, was compared to a method using either affine or deformation registrations.","Giers, Morgan B; McLaren, Alex C; Plasencia, Jonathan D; Frakes, David; McLemore, Ryan; Caplan, Michael R",Computational and mathematical methods in medicine,96,31

A periumbilical single-port technique reduces the size of the access wound, usually to 3-4 cm. However, in the presence of large phlegmon or fistulae, the risk of conversion is higher and the extraction site might be enlarged. A suprapubic Pfannenstiel incision reduces the risk of incisional hernia compared to umbilical access and might provide the possibility to perform sigmoidectomy with a hybrid technique. The aim of the present study was to investigate the feasibility of laparoscopic sigmoidectomy through a single suprapubic transverse access for large diverticular phlegmon. METHODS Consecutive patients with a diverticular inflammatory mass ≥ 5 cm, with or without sigmoid-vesical fistula, were considered candidates for laparoscopic sigmoidectomy through a 5-cm single-port suprapubic (SPSP) access, extended (if required) to match the size of the inflammatory mass. RESULTS Twenty patients underwent SPSP sigmoidectomy at our institution in April 2014-April 2017. All procedures were completed by SPSP access, with no intraoperative complications or need for additional trocar placement. Eight patients had a sigmoid-vesical fistula (bladder sutured in three patients). The splenic flexure was mobilized in nine patients. Median operative time was 178 min and median hospital stay was 5.5 days (iqr 4-6). Postoperative complications occurred in four patients and included one subcutaneous hematoma, one urinary tract infection, and two superficial wound infections. After a median follow-up time of 25 months (interquartile range 15-38), all patients experienced complete resolution of symptoms, with no incisional hernias reported. CONCLUSIONS SPSP sigmoidectomy for diverticulitis is feasible and effective, minimizing the size of the access wound and avoiding increased risk of hernia. This approach might be especially valuable for the management of large diverticular phlegmon and sigmoid-vesical fistula.","Spinelli, A; Di Candido, F; Carvello, M",Techniques in coloproctology,96,7

These changes may be related to the number of new COVID-19 cases per day since they are visual indicators of the changes in the epidemic and are of interest to the public. This descriptive research took the spine surgery department as an example in a Grade-A tertiary hospital in Anhui province, China. The number and distribution of patients from January 24 to April 2, 2020 was collected and compared with the past 5 years. A psychological scale was constructed to assess the psychological distress of patients and the number of new COVID-19 cases per day in Anhui, China was collected each day from January 24 to April 2, 2020. Also, this research compared these variables with the emergency response or the number of new COVID-19 cases per day. All distributions dropped dramatically during first-level emergency response and then back to normal. The psychological distress of patients was relatively higher at the beginning of the outbreak and then gradually returned to normal. The trends between the psychological distress of patients and the number of new COVID-19 cases per day were similar. The number of new COVID-19 cases per day could be used to predict psychological distress, changes in patient numbers and distributions, which was beneficial for the department of spine surgery to adjust its treatment strategy during the epidemic.","Zheng, Yongshun; Zhang, Xingfang; Fang, Shiyuan; Zhang, Fan",Science progress,96,31

While it is acknowledged that children who are exposed to FDV have poorer general health, there is a lack of data on the outcomes of children exposed to FDV. The use of longitudinal data has been suggested as a way to gain an understanding of the impact on children's long-term outcomes. METHODS Our cohort study used deidentified individual-level linked administrative data of children born 1987-2010, in Western Australia, who were exposed to FDV in the prenatal period (12 months prior to birth) to five years of age (early years). RESULTS Children exposed to FDV are more likely to be hospitalised than non-exposed children. Children exposed to FDV in both the prenatal and early childhood period had a threefold increased odds of mental health hospitalisation. We found a significant increase in odds of pregnancy-related hospitalisation in FDV exposed children. When stratified by Aboriginal status, Aboriginal children had a higher proportion of hospitalisations than non-Aboriginal children. CONCLUSION Exposed children have an increased likelihood for hospitalisation than non-exposed children. Within the exposed cohort differences were apparent between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children. Aboriginal children had greater odds for hospitalisation in most of the diagnostic groups compared to their non-Aboriginal counterparts. Our findings represent an important advance in the literature with respect to the burden of disease of children exposed to FDV.","Orr, Carol; Fisher, Colleen M; Preen, David B; Glauert, Rebecca A; O'Donnell, Melissa",PloS one,96,5

OBJECTIVE To determine the effect of two-handed jaw thrust on postoperative sore throat in patients requiring insertion of a DLT. DESIGN A prospective double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised study. SETTING A tertiary teaching hospital from December 2017 to May 2018. PATIENTS One-hundred and six patients undergoing one-lung anaesthesia. INTERVENTIONS Patients were allocated to one of two groups (n=53 each). In the jaw thrust group, the two-handed jaw thrust manoeuvre was applied at intubation and advancement of the DLT. In the control group, conventional intubation with a sham jaw thrust was performed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Incidence of sore throat at 1, 6 and 24 h postoperatively. RESULTS The incidence of sore throat at 6 h postoperatively was higher in the control group than in the jaw thrust group [31 (59%) vs. 14 (26%), risk ratio (95% confidence interval) 0.45 (0.27 to 0.75), P < 0.01].

Nonetheless, they have resulted in reducing the number of active cases of COVID-19. Chile has begun the de-escalation and needs to know the best time to end the restrictions. Objective We discuss the best conditions and guarantees for the end of compulsory confinement. Methods This study is based on a trend model with prediction estimation. The data of the variables of interest were subjected to linear regression studies to determine the curve that best explained the data. The coefficient of determination, the standard deviation of y in x, and the confidence interval of the observed curve were estimated. The trend curve was chosen in accordance with the regression estimates. Outcomes It was found that all dependent variables tended to decrease over time in a quadratic fashion, except for the new cases variable. In general, the R2 and MAPE estimates are satisfactory, except for the variable number of PCR tests per day. Conclusions Gradual and cautious steps should be taken before ending mandatory confinement. In the current de-escalator, daily PCR tests should be increased, maintaining vigilance on indicators of incidence, prevalence, and positivity of PCR tests. Evidence suggests with some degree of confidence that mandatory confinement could be safely lifted as of August 30, 2020. Long-term preparations must be made to contain future waves of new cases.","San Martín-Roldán, David; Rojo-Lazo, Francisca; Calzadilla-Núñez, Aracelis; San Martín-Roldán, Pablo; Díaz-Calzadilla, Patricia; Díaz-Narváez, Víctor P",Medwave,96,17

Low HRV is an indicator of potential autonomic nervous system dysfunction. People with chronic pain often display autonomic dysregulation, especially in the parasympathetic nervous system. The hormone oxytocin has been shown to increase HRV in non-clinical samples, but its potential impact on HRV in persons with chronic pain is unknown. This study investigated the impact of intranasal oxytocin on HRV in persons with chronic neck and shoulder pain. Participants included 24 individuals with chronic neck and shoulder pain lasting >12months and 24 age- and sex-matched pain-free controls. In a randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study, participants self-administered intranasal oxytocin (24IU) in one session, and placebo in another, before HRV was recorded at rest and during a mental arithmetic task. Intranasal oxytocin did not influence HRV at rest. However, compared to placebo, intranasal oxytocin elicited small decreases in low-frequency and high-frequency HRV in both groups during the mental arithmetic task. These results suggest that intranasal oxytocin may enhance the salience of the mental arithmetic task, leading to reduced engagement of the parasympathetic nervous system when completing the task. Further investigation and replication of these findings are required to improve our understanding of the effects of intranasal oxytocin on autonomic functioning both at rest and under cognitive stress.","Tracy, Lincoln M; Gibson, Stephen J; Labuschagne, Izelle; Georgiou-Karistianis, Nellie; Giummarra, Melita J",Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry,96,1

The clinical presentation of severe COVID-19 includes a broad spectrum of clinical disease, most notably acute respiratory distress syndrome, cytokine release syndrome (CRS), multiorgan failure, and death. Direct viral damage and uncontrolled inflammation have been suggested as contributory factors in COVID-19 disease severity. The COVID-19 pandemic has emphasized the critical role of an effective host immune response in controlling a virus infection and demonstrated the devastating effect of immune dysregulation. Understanding the nature of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis is key to developing effective treatments for COVID-19.

The secondary aims were to assess whether there were clinical factors associated with COVID-19 status, the mortality rate of patients with COVID-19, and the rate of potential COVID-19 in patients not presenting to healthcare services. METHODS A multicentre retrospective study was conducted of patients undergoing hip or knee arthroplasty during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (1 March 2020 to 31 March 2020) with a minimum of 60 days follow-up. Patient demographics, American Society of Anesthesiologists grade, procedure type, primary or revision, length of stay (LOS), COVID-19 test status, and postoperative mortality were recorded. A subgroup of patients (n = 211) who had not presented to healthcare services after discharge were contacted and questioned as to whether they had symptoms of COVID-19. RESULTS Five (0.5%) of 1,073 patients who underwent hip or knee arthroplasty tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 postoperatively. When adjusting for confounding factors, increasing LOS (p = 0.022) was the only significant factor associated with developing COVID-19 following surgery and a stay greater than three days was a reliable predictor with an area under the curve of 81% (p = 0.018). There were three (0.3%) deaths in the study cohort and the overall mortality rate attributable to COVID-19 was 0.09% (n = 1/1,073), with one (20%) of the five patients with COVID-19 dying postoperatively. Of the 211 patients contacted, two had symptoms within two to 14 days postoperatively with a positive predictive value of 31% and it was therefore estimated that one patient may have had undiagnosed COVID-19. CONCLUSION The rate of postoperative COVID-19 was 0.5% and may have been as high as 1% when accounting for those patients not presenting to healthcare services, which was similar to the estimated population prevalence during the study period. The overall mortality rate secondary to COVID-19 was low (0.09%), however the mortality rate for those patients developing COVID-19 was 20%.","Clement, Nicholas D; Hall, Andrew J; Kader, Nardeen; Ollivere, Benjamin; Oussedik, Sam; Kader, Deiary F; Deehan, David J; Duckworth, Andrew D",The bone & joint journal,96,1

More than 500 million people worldwide are estimated to have chronic infections with HBV and/or HCV, and they have an increased risk of developing liver complications, such as cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. During the past decade, several antiviral agents including immune-modulatory drugs and nucleoside/nucleotide analogues have been approved for the treatment of HBV and HCV infections. In recent years, the focus has been on the development of new and better therapeutic agents for management of chronic HCV infections. Bioinformatics has only been applied recently to the field of viral hepatitis research. In addition to the wide range of general tools freely available for identification of open reading frames, gene prediction, homology searching, sequence alignment, and motif and epitope recognition, several public database systems designed specifically for HBV and HCV research have now been developed. The focus of these databases ranged from being viral sequence repositories for the provision of bioinformatics tools for viral genome analysis, as well as HBV or HCV drug resistance prediction. This review provides an overview of these public databases, which have integrated bioinformatics tools for HBV and HCV research. Properly managed and developed, these databases have the potential to have a broad effect on hepatitis research and treatment strategies. However, the effect will depend on the comprehensive collection of not only molecular sequence data, but also anonymous patient clinical and treatment data.","Moriconi, Francesco; Beard, Michael R; Yuen, Lilly Kw",Antiviral therapy,96,17

In addition, 20% to 53% of infants will have > or = 1 episode of lower respiratory infection in the first year of life. The current methods of diagnosing respiratory viruses are limited in scope and sensitivity. Polymerase chain reaction is a more sensitive method than antigen detection and is often used for newly discovered viruses. Using polymerase chain reaction, we sought to diagnose adenoviruses, human bocavirus, and human metapneumovirus at our children's hospital. METHODS Nasal-swab specimens submitted for antigen detection of respiratory viruses were collected and processed by using polymerase chain reaction to detect adenoviruses, human bocavirus, and human metapneumovirus. Inpatient and emergency department records were reviewed for clinical and demographic data. RESULTS Approximately 1500 specimens were collected over 21 months; they contained adenoviruses, human bocavirus, and human metapneumovirus in 5.9%, 5.6%, and 5.2% of children, respectively. Using polymerase chain reaction and antigen detection, a viral agent was identified in as many as 62% of the specimens. Lower respiratory tract disease was present most frequently in patients infected with human metapneumovirus (63%) and least frequently in those infected with adenoviruses (45%). We detected adenoviruses by polymerase chain reaction in 59 patients for whom the antigen-detection test results were negative. A paroxysmal cough led to clinical suspicion of Bordetella pertussis infection in 19% of patients infected with human bocavirus. CONCLUSIONS Adenoviruses, human bocavirus, and human metapneumovirus were each present in approximately 5% of specimens submitted for respiratory virus rapid testing. The lower respiratory tract was more commonly affected in patients with human bocavirus and human metapneumovirus infections. Adenovirus was often undiagnosed by antigen detection. Other findings included the presence of a pertussis-like illness associated with human bocavirus.","Arnold, John C; Singh, Kumud K; Spector, Stephen A; Sawyer, Mark H",Pediatrics,96,1

Here, we characterize, for the first time, a long-latency, inhibitory spinal pathway to ankle flexors that is activated by low-threshold homonymous afferents. To examine this inhibitory pathway in uninjured, healthy participants, we suppressed motor-evoked potentials (MEPs), produced in the tibialis anterior (TA), by a prior stimulation to the homonymous common peroneal nerve (CPN). The TA MEP was suppressed by a triple-pulse stimulation to the CPN, applied 40, 50, and 60 ms earlier and at intensities of 0.5-0.7 times motor threshold (average suppression of test MEP was 33%). Whereas the triple-pulse stimulation was below M-wave and H-reflex threshold, it produced a long-latency inhibition of background muscle activity, approximately 65-115 ms after the CPN stimulation, a time period that overlapped with the test MEP. However, not all of the MEP suppression could be accounted for by this decrease in background muscle activity. Evoked responses from direct activation of the corticospinal tract, at the level of the brain stem or thoracic spinal cord, were also suppressed by low-threshold CPN stimulation. Our findings suggest that low-threshold muscle and cutaneous afferents from the CPN activate a long-latency, homonymous spinal inhibitory pathway to TA motoneurons. We propose that inhibitory feedback from spinal networks, activated by low-threshold homonymous afferents, helps regulate the activation of flexor motoneurons by the corticospinal tract.","Zewdie, Ephrem T; Roy, Francois D; Okuma, Yoshino; Yang, Jaynie F; Gorassini, Monica A",Journal of neurophysiology,96,19

Benzodiazepines are commonly used for treatment; physostigmine is also effective but is underutilized due to concerns for safety and short duration of action. The objective of this study was to compare lorazepam to physostigmine for the treatment of antimuscarinic delirium and agitation. METHODS This was a blinded, randomized clinical trial in patients presenting for antimuscarinic toxidrome. Inclusion criteria were: ≥10-<18 years old, at least one central and two peripheral antimuscarinic symptoms, delirium and moderate agitation. Subjects were randomized to either (1) lorazepam bolus (0.05 mg/kg) followed by a 4-h normal saline infusion, or (2) physostigmine 0.02 mg/kg bolus followed by a 4-h physostigmine infusion (0.02 mg/kg/h). Primary outcomes were the control of delirium and agitation after bolus and during the infusion. RESULTS Ten (53%) subjects were enrolled in the lorazepam arm, 9 (47%) in the physostigmine arm. Diphenhydramine was the most common agent ingested (16, 84%). Fewer patients receiving physostigmine had delirium after the initial bolus (44% vs 100%, p = 0.01) and at the 4th hour of infusion (22% vs 100%, p < 0.001) compared to patients who received lorazepam. There was a significant decrease in agitation scores in the physostigmine arm compared to the lorazepam arm after the initial bolus (89% vs 30%, p = 0.02), but no difference at the 4th hour of infusion (p > 0.99). There were no seizures, bradycardia, bronchorrhea, bronchospasm, intubation, or cardiac dysrhythmias. CONCLUSION Physostigmine was superior to lorazepam in controlling antimuscarinic delirium and agitation after bolus dosing, and control of delirium after a 4-h infusion. There were no serious adverse events in either treatment arm. Physostigmine bolus and infusion should be considered in adolescent patients with significant delirium and agitation from antimuscarinic agents.","Wang, George Sam; Baker, Keith; Ng, Patrick; Janis, Gregory C; Leonard, Jan; Mistry, Rakesh D; Heard, Kennon",Clinical toxicology,96,17

METHODS AND MATERIALS We prospectively enrolled patients who required de novo placement of a chronic tunneled catheter for hemodialysis or exchange of a dysfunctional catheter as part of an Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved protocol. Catheter patency, Kt/V, mean blood-flow (Qb), and pump pressures were obtained at baseline and at monthly intervals to 90 days. RESULTS Forty-six subjects were enrolled into the study. During the 90-day observation period, maximum blood-flow rate averaged 355-398 mL/minute; mean Qb averaged 333-392 mL/minute. Mean Kt/V values were consistently ≥1.5. Dwell-time was 15-114 days, for a total of 2997 catheter days (mean 71.4 days). Excluding patients who died during the study and those receiving surgical access, overall intervention-free catheter patency rate was 94.9%, 92.2% and 88.8% at days 30, 60, 90, respectively. There were no acute complications. During the follow-up period, three patients developed complications (6.5%). Two catheter infections occurred (0.7/1000 catheter days) and one catheter malfunctioned; a rate of 1.0/ 1000 catheter days for all complications. CONCLUSIONS The VectorFlow catheter produced safe, effective hemodialysis with Kt/V ≥1.5. A single catheter occlusion occurred and a low rate of infection was seen.

As a response, the LTCI (long-term care insurance) system has been executed among European countries and piloted in 15 cities of China in 2016. Subsequently, the influence and dilemma of LTCI system have become a hot academic topic in the past 20 years. Methods The review was carried out to reveal the effects of the LTCI system on different economic entities by reviewing relevant literature published from January 2008 to September 2019. The quality of 25 quantitative and 24 qualitative articles was evaluated using the JBI and CASP critical evaluation checklist, respectively. Results The review systematically examines the effects of the LTCI system on different microeconomic entities such as caretakers or their families and macroeconomic entities such as government spending. The results show that the LTCI system has a great impact on social welfare. For example, LTCI has a positive effect on the health and life quality of the disabled elderly. However, the role of LTCI in alleviating the financial burden on families with the disabled elderly may be limited. Conclusion Implementation of LTCI system not only in reducing the physical and mental health problems of health care recipients and providers, and the economic burden of their families, but also promote the development of health care service industry and further improvement of the health care system. However, the dilemma and sustainable development of the LTCI system is the government needs to focus on in the future due to the sustainability of its funding sources.","Chen, Linhong; Xu, Xiaocang",Journal of multidisciplinary healthcare,96,1

RESULTS Of the 25 patients, 9 (36%) required percutaneous drainage for a median of 7 days (5-14 days) after insertion, and 3 (12%) required conversion to reduced-port laparoscopic surgery with a 5-mm port insertion because of severe adhesions to adjacent organs. Of 22 patients undergoing SPLS, 13 underwent pure SPLS (52.0%) whereas 9 patients underwent SPLS with a 2-mm needle instrument (36.0%). Median operation time was 70 minutes (30-155 minutes), and a drainage tube was placed in 9 patients (36.0%). Median total length of incision was 2.5 cm (2.0-3.0 cm), and median time to soft diet initiation and length of stay in the hospital were 2 days (0-5 days) and 3 days (1-7 days), respectively. Two patients (8.0%) developed postoperative complications: 1 wound site bleeding and 1 surgical site infection. CONCLUSION Conservative management followed by a single-port laparoscopic interval appendectomy using a multichannel single-port appears feasible and safe for treating patients with acute perforated appendicitis with periappendiceal abscess.","Bae, Sung Uk; Jeong, Woon Kyung; Baek, Seong Kyu",Annals of coloproctology,96,12

To study the dynamics of the state of the hemostasis system and the severity of the acute phase response in patients with new coronavirus pneumonia. We determined APTT, prothrombin time (PT), fibrinogen (F), D-dimers (D-d), antitrombin III (AT III), C-reactive protein (CRP), platelet count in 22 patients. In 49 patients, the viscoelastic properties of a blood clot were studied by thromboelastography (TEG) with koalin. The age of the patients ranged from 40 to 77 years. According to CT, the severity of 100% cases corresponded to CT2-CT3. Acute respiratory failure (ARF) was diagnosed in 16 patients. A control group included 25 apparently healthy subjects. During hospitalization, patients with NCP were characterized by: an increase in the concentration of D-d, CRP, Fg, lengthening of APTT and PT, ATIII activity and platelet count not differing from the normal range. 10 days after hospitalization and against the background of ongoing therapy, patients with NCP showed positive dynamics in the hemostasiological profile and the severity of the inflammatory response. Thromboelastography indices in patients with LCP did not differ from control values both at hospitalization and on day 10.Thus, in patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia, an increased prothrombotic activity and a pronounced inflammatory response are recorded. Against the background of treatment, there is a positive dynamics in both the coagulation status and the inflammatory response. Additional studies are needed to determine the diagnostic capabilities of thromboelastography in patients with NCP.","Presnyakova, M V; Galova, E A; Sosnina, L N; Popovicheva, A N; Lyubavina, N A; Kostina, O V; Kuznetsova, V L; Karyakin, N N",Klinicheskaia laboratornaia diagnostika,96,1

The natural history of these lesions and medium- and long-term patient outcomes are poorly understood. The authors sought to evaluate patient prognosis after diagnosis of fusiform dolichoectatic vertebrobasilar aneurysms and to identify clinical and radiographic predictors of neurological deterioration. METHODS The authors reviewed multiple, prospectively maintained, single-provider databases at 3 large-volume cerebrovascular centers to obtain data on patients with unruptured, fusiform, basilar artery dolichoectatic aneurysms diagnosed between January 1, 2000, and January 1, 2015. RESULTS A total of 50 patients (33 men, 17 women) were identified; mean clinical follow-up was 50.1 months and mean radiographic follow-up was 32.4 months. At last follow-up, 42% (n = 21) of aneurysms had progressed and 44% (n = 22) of patients had deterioration of their modified Rankin Scale scores. When patients were dichotomized into 2 groups- those who worsened and those who did not-univariate analysis showed 5 variables to be statistically significantly different: sex (p = 0.007), radiographic brainstem compression (p = 0.03), clinical posterior fossa compression (p < 0.001), aneurysmal growth on subsequent imaging (p = 0.001), and surgical therapy (p = 0.006). A binary logistic regression was then created to evaluate these variables. The only variable found to be a statistically significant predictor of clinical worsening was clinical symptoms of posterior fossa compression at presentation (p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS Fusiform dolichoectatic vertebrobasilar aneurysms carry a poor prognosis, with approximately one-half of the patients deteriorating or experiencing progression of their aneurysm within 5 years. Despite being high risk, intervention-when carefully timed (before neurological decline)-may be beneficial in select patients.","Xu, David S; Levitt, Michael R; Kalani, M Yashar S; Rangel-Castilla, Leonardo; Mulholland, Celene B; Abecassis, Isaac J; Morton, Ryan P; Nerva, John D; Siddiqui, Adnan H; Levy, Elad I; Spetzler, Robert F; Albuquerque, Felipe C; McDougall, Cameron G",Journal of neurosurgery,96,1

We examined the mental health impact of reduced working in a nationally representative sample of employees. METHOD We used Wave one (April 2020) of the Understanding Society UK Household Longitudinal Study (UKHLS) COVID-19 study, with linkage to baseline mental health data from the UKHLS annual survey (January 2017- December 2018). Analysis was based on adults aged 18-65 who were employees in January/February 2020 (n=8,708), with psychological distress assessed using the GHQ-12. Logistic regression examined the mental health impact of reduced working and reasons for the reduction. RESULTS Forty two percent of employees reported reduced working by April 2020, with 22% furloughed. There was no evidence of an association between reduced working per se and psychological distress in the fully adjusted model (OR=1.06, 95%CI 0.91-1.23). Those permanently laid-off (less than 1% of employees) were most vulnerable to adverse mental health effects in the early months of the pandemic (OR=3.60, 95%CI 1.55-8.37). We also found evidence of higher levels of psychological distress among those sick or self-isolating, and those with reduced working due to caring responsibilities. LIMITATIONS While the GHQ is a widely used and validated instrument in identifying potential psychiatric disorders, it is important to note that it does not represent a clinical assessment. CONCLUSIONS Longitudinal examination of employment transitions and mental ill-health related to pandemic outcomes is imperative and should help inform public health responses and ongoing government policy in supporting those adversely affected.","Ferry, Finola; Bunting, Brendan; Rosato, Michael; Curran, Emma; Leavey, Gerard",Journal of affective disorders,96,29

We aimed to describe trajectories of depression, anxiety and stress symptoms during the COVID-19 outbreak compared to before the outbreak, and to determine if trajectories were modified by pre-pandemic loneliness, poor sleep quality and mental health problems. METHODS We conducted a cohort study with 1836 Swedish university students entering the study before 13 March 2020, the onset of the pandemic, with follow-ups within three (FU1) and six months (FU2) of the outbreak. Generalized Estimating Equations were used to estimate mean differences in symptom levels over time-periods, and to estimate potential effect modifications. RESULTS We found small differences in mean levels of the depression, anxiety and stress scale (DASS-21) over time. Compared to before the pandemic, depression increased by 0.25 points of 21 (95% CI: 0.04 to -0.45) at FU1 and decreased by 0.75/21 (95% CI:-0.97 to -0.53) at FU2. Anxiety decreased from baseline to FU1 by 0.09/21 (95% CI: -0.24 to -0.07) and by 0.77/21 (95% CI: -0.93 to -0.61) to FU2. Stress decreased from baseline to FU1 by 0.30/21 (95% CI: -0.52 to -0.09) and by 1.32/21 (95% CI: -1.55 to -1.09) to FU2. Students with pre-pandemic loneliness, poor sleep quality or pre-pandemic mental health problems did not have worse trajectories of mean mental health symptoms. CONCLUSIONS Symptom levels were relatively stable during the first three months of the pandemic, while there was a slight decrease during the summer months, probably due to seasonality effects.","Johansson, Fred; Côté, Pierre; Hogg-Johnson, Sheilah; Rudman, Ann; Holm, Lena W; Grotle, Margreth; Jensen, Irene; Sundberg, Tobias; Edlund, Klara; Skillgate, Eva",Scandinavian journal of public health,96,31

Ricin is considered to be a major bio-threat as it can be freely and easily acquired in large quantities. A deliberate release of such toxin in civilian populations would very likely overwhelm existing public health systems, resulting in public fear and social unrest. There is currently no commercially available or FDA-approved prophylaxis such as vaccines, or therapeutic antitoxins or antidotes, available for ricin intoxication. Patient treatment is typically supportive care based on symptoms, often designed to reinforce the body's natural response. This paper describes the development and validation of a robust ELISA test kit, which can be used to screen for ricin in biological specimens such as whole blood and faeces. Faecal specimens are shown in this study to have better diagnostic sensitivity and a wider diagnostic window compared to whole blood. From these results, it is concluded that faeces is the most suitable clinical specimen for diagnosis of ricin poisoning via the oral route. The ELISA test kit can also detect ricin in environmental samples. An advantage of this ELISA kit over other commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) detection kits currently on the market that are developed to screen environmental samples only is its ability to diagnose ricin poisoning from clinical specimens as well as detect ricin from environmental samples.","Chen, Hsiao Ying; Tran, Hung; Foo, Ling Yann; Sew, Tracey Wenhui; Loke, Weng Keong",Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry,96,20

Currently available evidence does not support the use of nocturnal NIV in unselected patients with stable COPD. Several European studies have reported benefit for high intensity NIV, in which setting of inspiratory pressure and respiratory rate are selected to achieve normocapnia. There have also been studies reporting benefit for the use of NIV as an adjunct to exercise training. NIV may be useful as an adjunct to airway clearance techniques in patients with cystic fibrosis. Accumulating evidence supports the use of NIV in patients with obesity hypoventilation syndrome. There is considerable observational evidence supporting the use of NIV in patients with chronic respiratory failure related to neuromuscular disease, and one randomized controlled trial reported that the use of NIV was life-prolonging in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. A variety of interfaces can be used to provide NIV in patients with stable chronic respiratory failure. The mouthpiece is an interface that is unique in this patient population, and has been used with success in patients with neuromuscular disease. Bi-level pressure ventilators are commonly used for NIV, although there are now a new generation of intermediate ventilators that are portable, have a long battery life, and can be used for NIV and invasive applications. Pressure support ventilation, pressure controlled ventilation, and volume controlled ventilation have been used successfully for chronic applications of NIV. New modes have recently become available, but their benefits await evidence to support their widespread use. The success of NIV in a given patient population depends on selection of an appropriate patient, selection of an appropriate interface, selection of an appropriate ventilator and ventilator settings, the skills of the clinician, the motivation of the patient, and the support of the family.","Hess, Dean R",Respiratory care,96,30

In Indonesia the majority of local outbreaks have occurred in back yard flocks with native chickens, and it is therefore of interest to determine whether these birds can be protected against infection by vaccination. To this end two transmission experiments were carried out with H5N1 virus (A/chicken/Legok/2003) in vaccinated and unvaccinated native chickens. The vaccine contained an inactivated heterologous H5N2 strain (A/turkey/England/N28/73 H5N2). Birds were vaccinated at 4 and 7 weeks of age and challenged at 10 weeks of age. During 10 days post-challenge tracheal and cloacal swabs were taken for virus isolation, and serum blood was collected regularly to measure haemaglutinin inhibiting (HI) antibody responses. The results show that transmission of H5N1 virus was rapid and efficient in unvaccinated birds, that infection and transmission were completely prevented in vaccinated birds, and that vaccinated birds that were exposed to unvaccinated inoculated birds were still protected from infection. These findings indicate that vaccination with a heterologous H5N2 vaccine is able to prevent virus transmission in flocks of native chickens.","Poetri, O N; Bouma, A; Murtini, Sri; Claassen, I; Koch, G; Soejoedono, Retno D; Stegeman, J A; van Boven, M",Vaccine,96,5

Distance mentorship models may be utilized to overcome geographic limitations, increase mentorship access, and strengthen mentoring relationships in surgery. OBJECTIVE This review aimed to identify the scope of literature on distance mentoring in surgery, the range of its application, its effectiveness, and any gaps in the literature that should be addressed in order to enhance mentorship in the surgical field. DESIGN A comprehensive PubMed review was performed in January 2021 on distance mentorship of students, trainees, and surgeons in the surgical field. Reviews, replies, and non-English articles were excluded. Data was extracted regarding publication year, author's country, specialty, subjects, aim of mentorship model, and efficacy. RESULTS 134 total studies met inclusion and exclusion criteria. Most studies were published in 2020, written by authors in the United States, from general surgery, and featured an expert surgeon paired with a more junior fully trained surgeon. In all, 93.3% of studies utilized distance mentorship to enhance surgical skill through telementoring and only 4.5% were focused on mentorship to enhance careers through professional development. The remaining studies utilized distance mentorship models to increase surgical research (0.7%) and clinical knowledge (1.5%). CONCLUSION The results of this review suggest successful implementation of distance mentoring in surgery through telementoring, but a lack of professionally aimed distance mentorship programs. Amidst COVID-19, distance mentorship is particularly important because of decreased face-to-face opportunity. Future studies in the surgical field should investigate distance mentoring as a means of increasing mentorship for professional development.","Raborn, Layne N; Janis, Jeffrey E",Journal of surgical education,96,12

Results from a simulated scenario study.,14.726189,8.211546,2020,"With over 150 million people chronically infected worldwide and millions more infected annually, hepatitis C continues to pose a burden on the global healthcare system. The standard therapy of hepatitis C remains expensive, with severe associated side effects and inconsistent cure rates. Vaccine development against the hepatitis C virus has been hampered by practical and biological challenges posed by viral evasion mechanisms. Despite these challenges, HCV vaccine research has presented a number of candidate vaccines that progressed to phase II trials. However, those efforts focused mainly on HCV genotypes 1 and 2 as vaccine targets and barely enough attention was given to genotype 4, the variant most prevalent in the Middle East and central Africa. We describe herein the in silico identification of highly conserved and immunogenic T-cell epitopes from the HCV genotype 4 proteome, using the iVAX immunoinformatics toolkit, as targets for an epitope-driven vaccine. We also describe a fast and inexpensive approach for results validation using the empirical data on the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) as a reference. Our analysis identified 90 HLA class I epitopes of which 20 were found to be novel and 19 more had their binding predictions retrospectively validated; empirical data for the remaining 51 epitopes was insufficient to validate their binding predictions. Our analysis also identified 14 HLA class II epitopes, of which 8 had most of their binding predictions validated. Further investigation is required regarding the efficacy of the identified epitopes as vaccine targets in populations where HCV genotype 4 is most prevalent.","Abdel-Hady, Karim M; Gutierrez, Andres H; Terry, Frances; Desrosiers, Joe; De Groot, Anne S; Azzazy, Hassan M E",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,96,16

Early studies used lymphazurin (LZ) for SLNB. A national shortage of LZ promoted methylene blue (MB) as an alternate stain. OBJECTIVE This study compares complication rates between LZ and MB in SLNB patients, and the reliability dyes in locating sentinel lymph nodes. METHODS Charts were reviewed for patients who underwent SLNB for skin cancers between September 2006 and November 2008 at Penn State Hershey Medical Center. The type and quantity of dye, the presence of blue stained sentinel nodes, and any complications were recorded. RESULTS Ninety-three patients underwent SLNB (46 LZ, 47 MB). The amount of dye used was similar (avg. 0.93 ml LZ, 1.24 ml MB). The complication rate of LZ was 8.7%, and MB was 25.5%. There was significantly more (P = 0.003) skin graft complications in the MB patients (6/12) versus LZ (0/15). CONCLUSIONS There is a higher rate of complications with MB, especially with skin grafting. The reported risk of anaphylaxis with LZ has not been reported in volumes <2 ml. The sentinel lymph node identification rate is historically similar between dyes, and in this study was noted to be higher with LZ.","Neves, Rogerio I; Reynolds, Brandon Q; Hazard, Sprague W; Saunders, Brian; Mackay, Donald R",Journal of surgical oncology,96,33

INTRODUCTION Shoulder pain is a common musculoskeletal complaint in which rotator cuff tendons are usually affected. Shockwave therapy is a novel conservative treatment option for rotator cuff-related shoulder pain. A systematic review in 2004 reported conflicting results on the effectiveness of shockwave therapy in treating chronic rotator cuff tendonitis, whereby it is effective for calcific rotator cuff tendonitis but not for non-calcific ones. Hence, it is timely to review this topic with the addition of results from studies published since 2004. INCLUSION CRITERIA This review will consider randomized controlled trials that have evaluated shockwave therapy delivered via radial or focused extracorporeal means in individuals with rotator cuff tendinopathy without restrictions of race, gender, and age. Studies comparing individuals receiving shockwave therapy of varying dosages will be excluded in this review. METHODS A three-step search strategy will be used to locate studies published in English from databases. No search restrictions were applied regarding the year of publication. Study selection, assessment of methodological quality, and data extraction will be conducted by two independent reviewers. Data will be pooled in statistical meta-analysis, where possible. A funnel plot will be generated to detect any potential publication bias. The quality of the evidence will be analyzed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach.

Methods A systematic search from inception to 2016 was conducted using nine electronic databases, trial registries and grey literature repositories. Randomized controlled trials and observational studies reporting RTW times after CTR were included. Study risk of bias was assessed using Cochrane risk of bias assessment tools. Time to RTW was summarized using median and range. Results A total of 56 relevant studies were identified: 18 randomized controlled trials and 38 observational studies. Only 4 studies were rated as having a low risk of bias. Reported RTW times ranged from 4-168 days. Few studies reported occupational information. Among 6 studies, median time to return to non-manual work was 21 days (range 7-41), compared with 39 days for manual work (range 18-101). Median time to return to modified or full duties was 23 days (ranges 12-50 and 17-64, respectively), as reported by 3 studies. There was no common method of defining, collecting or reporting RTW data. Conclusions This review highlights wide variation in reported RTW times after CTR. Whilst occupational factors may play a role, these were poorly reported, and there is currently limited evidence to inform individual patients of their expected duration of work absence after CTR. A standardized definition of RTW is needed, as well as an agreed method of collecting and reporting related data.","Newington, Lisa; Stevens, Martin; Warwick, David; Adams, Jo; Walker-Bone, Karen","Scandinavian journal of work, environment & health",96,1

Several strategies have been examined in the treatment of TD. Currently, however, there is no clear evidence of the effectiveness of these drugs in TD and they have been associated with many side effects. One particular strategy would be to use pharmaceutical agents which are known to influence the catecholaminergic system at various junctures. OBJECTIVES 1. To determine the effects of any of the following drugs for antipsychotic-induced TD in people with schizophrenia or other chronic mental illnesses.i. Drugs which influence the noradrenergic system.ii. Dopamine receptor agonists.iii. Dopamine receptor antagonists.iv. Dopamine-depletor drugs.v. Drugs that increase the production or release of dopamine.2. To examine whether any improvement occurred with short periods of intervention (less than 6 weeks) and, if this did occur, whether this effect was maintained at longer periods of follow-up.3. To examine if there was a differential effect for the various compounds.4. To examine whether the use of non-antipsychotic catecholaminergic drugs are most effective in those with more recent onset TD (less than five years). SEARCH METHODS We retrieved 712 references from searching the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (July 2015 and April 2017). We also inspected references of all identified studies for further trials and contacted authors of trials for additional information. SELECTION CRITERIA We selected studies if they were randomised controlled trials focusing on people with schizophrenia or other chronic mental illnesses and antipsychotic-induced tardive dyskinesia. We compared the use of catecholaminergic interventions versus placebo, no intervention, or any other intervention for the treatment of antipsychotic-induced tardive dyskinesia. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS We independently extracted data from these trials and we estimated risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assumed that people who left the studies early had no improvement. MAIN RESULTS There are 10 included trials (N = 261) published between 1973 and 2010; eight are new from the 2015 and 2017 update searches. Forty-eight studies are excluded. Participants were mostly chronically mentally ill inpatients in their 50s, and studies were primarily of short (2 to 6 weeks) duration. The overall risk of bias in these studies was unclear, mainly due to poor reporting of allocation concealment and generation of the sequence.

Another small trial compared tetrabenazine and haloperidol after 18 weeks' treatment and found no evidence of a difference on clinically important improvement in tardive dyskinesia symptoms (N = 13; RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.95; very low quality evidence). No study reported on adverse events.For remaining outcomes there was no evidence of a difference between any of the interventions: alpha-methyldopa versus placebo for deterioration of tardive dyskinesia symptoms (1 RCT; N = 20; RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.02 to 7.32; very low quality evidence), celiprolol versus placebo for leaving the study early (1 RCT; N = 35; RR 5.28, 95% CI 0.27 to 102.58; very low quality evidence) and quality of life (1 RCT; N = 35; RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.12; very low quality evidence), alpha-methyldopa versus reserpine for deterioration of tardive dyskinesia symptoms (1 RCT; N = 20; not estimable, no reported events; very low quality evidence), reserpine or carbidopa/levodopa versus placebo for deterioration of tardive dyskinesia symptoms (2 RCTs; N = 37; RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.35 to 3.99; very low quality evidence), oxypertine versus placebo for deterioration of mental state (1 RCT; N = 42; RR 2.20, 95% CI 0.22 to 22.45; very low quality evidence), dopaminergic drugs (amantadine, bromocriptine, tiapride, oxypertine, carbidopa/levodopa) versus placebo for leaving the study early (6 RCTs; N = 163; RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.65 to 2.54; very low quality evidence), and tetrabenazine versus haloperidol for deterioration of tardive dyskinesia symptoms (1 RCT; N = 13; RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.09 to 14.92) and leaving the study early (1 RCT; N = 13; RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.00). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Although there has been a large amount of research in this area, many studies were excluded due to inherent problems in the nature of their cross-over designs. Usually data are not reported before the cross-over and the nature of TD and its likely response to treatments make it imprudent to use this data. The review provides little usable information for service users or providers and more well-designed and well-reported studies are indicated.","El-Sayeh, Hany G; Rathbone, John; Soares-Weiser, Karla; Bergman, Hanna",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,96,24

The design of optimal coronavirus vaccines therefore remains a priority. Such vaccines present major challenges: coronavirus immunity often wanes rapidly, individuals needing to be protected include the elderly, and vaccines may exacerbate rather than prevent coronavirus lung immunopathology. To address these issues, we compared in a murine model a range of recombinant spike protein or inactivated whole-virus vaccine candidates alone or adjuvanted with either alum, CpG, or Advax, a new delta inulin-based polysaccharide adjuvant. While all vaccines protected against lethal infection, addition of adjuvant significantly increased serum neutralizing-antibody titers and reduced lung virus titers on day 3 postchallenge. Whereas unadjuvanted or alum-formulated vaccines were associated with significantly increased lung eosinophilic immunopathology on day 6 postchallenge, this was not seen in mice immunized with vaccines formulated with delta inulin adjuvant. Protection against eosinophilic immunopathology by vaccines containing delta inulin adjuvants correlated better with enhanced T-cell gamma interferon (IFN-γ) recall responses rather than reduced interleukin-4 (IL-4) responses, suggesting that immunopathology predominantly reflects an inadequate vaccine-induced Th1 response. This study highlights the critical importance for development of effective and safe coronavirus vaccines of selection of adjuvants based on the ability to induce durable IFN-γ responses. IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (MERS-CoV) cause high case fatality rates and remain major human public health threats, creating a need for effective vaccines. While coronavirus antigens that induce protective neutralizing antibodies have been identified, coronavirus vaccines present a unique problem in that immunized individuals when infected by virus can develop lung eosinophilic pathology, a problem that is further exacerbated by the formulation of SARS-CoV vaccines with alum adjuvants. This study shows that formulation of SARS-CoV spike protein or inactivated whole-virus vaccines with novel delta inulin-based polysaccharide adjuvants enhances neutralizing-antibody titers and protection against clinical disease but at the same time also protects against development of lung eosinophilic immunopathology. It also shows that immunity achieved with delta inulin adjuvants is long-lived, thereby overcoming the natural tendency for rapidly waning coronavirus immunity. Thus, delta inulin adjuvants may offer a unique ability to develop safer and more effective coronavirus vaccines.","Honda-Okubo, Yoshikazu; Barnard, Dale; Ong, Chun Hao; Peng, Bi-Hung; Tseng, Chien-Te Kent; Petrovsky, Nikolai",Journal of virology,96,1

This cross-sectional online survey study evaluated the menstrual cycle characteristics of women in the reproductive phase of their lives during the COVID-19 pandemic in May 2020. Changes before and after COVID-19 were evaluated with a paired sample t-test and chi-square test. A Pearson correlation test was used to show the relationships between variables. The study was completed with 263 participants in total. The average age of the participants was 26.3 ± 6.9 (18-45). Participants' duration of period (p = .003) and pads used per day (p = .002) decreased compared to their experience before the COVID-19 outbreak. The mean total MSQ score was 3.1 ± 0.8 (0-4), mean STAI-1 score was 45.1 ± 9 (20-78) and mean STAI-II score was 43.3 ± 5.9 (30-69). It was found that STAI-I and STAI-II scores showed a positive correlation with MSQ-Somatic subgroup scores(r = 0.153, p = .013; 0.190, p = .002) and MSQ-Total scores (0.144, p = .020; 0.175, p = .004). With the COVID-19 pandemic, increased anxiety scores increased women's menstrual symptoms while the length of periods and the number of pads used decreased.Impact statementWhat is already known on this subject? The COVID 19 pandemic, has caused enormous psychological distress potentially resulting in the development of posttraumatic stress disorder. The menstrual cycle is a process that can be affected by psychological stress.What do the results of this study add? This is the first study to examine the relationship between stress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the menstrual cycle. The increases in the degree of anxiety and stress as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak was found to be high enough to affect the characteristics of the menstrual cycle in the women surveyed.What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? In a prospective study intended to be carried out after the outbreak ends in the future, it will be possible to evaluate whether the menstrual cycle parameters return to their former order and consequently this hypothesis will be able to be more definitively confirmed.","Demir, Omer; Sal, Hidayet; Comba, Cihan",Journal of obstetrics and gynaecology : the journal of the Institute of Obstetrics and Gynaecology,96,1

We aimed to identify the prevalence, clinical impact, and predictors of early reocclusion after initially successful thrombectomies within a prospective cohort. Methods- A total of 711 stroke patients with successful reperfusion (modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction, 2b/3) followed with magnetic resonance or computed tomographic angiography at 24 to 48 hours were included. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate associated factors and clinical impact. Results are displayed as adjusted odds ratio (aOR) and 95% CI. Improvement in accuracy of additional imaging findings on angiography control runs after the intervention was evaluated by area under the curve. Results- Early reocclusion was observed in 16 of 711 successfully reperfused patients (2.3%; 95% CI, 1.1-3.3; median delay: 20 hours). Suggestive predictors were higher platelets on admission (aOR, 1.01; 95% CI, 1.01-1.02), prestroke functional dependence (aOR, 7.12; 95% CI, 1.49-34.03), and stroke of undetermined or other specified pathogenesis in the TOAST classification (aOR, 7.19; 95% CI, 1.10-47.05 and aOR, 36.50; 95% CI, 4.47-298.11, respectively). When implementing residual embolic fragments or stenosis at the thrombectomy site into the logistic regression model, discrimination between patients with and without reocclusion improved significantly (area under the curve, 0.955 versus 0.854; P=0.023). Early reocclusion was an independent predictor of unfavorable outcome at 90 days (aOR for modified Rankin Scale ≤2, 0.13; 95% CI, 0.03-0.57). Conclusions- Early reocclusion within 48 hours after successful mechanical thrombectomy is rare but associated with poor outcome. Patients with high platelets on admission and residual embolic fragments or stenosis at the thrombectomy site are at high risk for reocclusion, which may be prevented or corrected after carefully re-evaluating the last angiographic run.","Mosimann, Pascal J; Kaesmacher, Johannes; Gautschi, Dominic; Bellwald, Sebastian; Panos, Leonidas; Piechowiak, Eike; Dobrocky, Tomas; Zibold, Felix; Mordasini, Pasquale; El-Koussy, Marwan; Wiest, Roland; Bervini, David; Wagner, Franca; Arnold, Marcel; Jung, Simon; Galimanis, Aikaterini; Gralla, Jan; Fischer, Urs",Stroke,96,7

Ophthalmologists can be confronted at any time with potentially COVID-19 associated ocular symptoms or manifestations in patients and also become infected through close patient contact. Even without systemic infection, the ocular surface can come into direct contact with aerosols or liquids containing SARS-CoV-2 particles. A smear infection through hand-to-eye contact is also possible. A purely isolated ocular infection has not yet been shown. Rather, it seems that ocular complications occur in the context of a systemic infection. However, ocular symptoms can also be the first symptom of COVID-19. The most common ocular complication of COVID-19 is mild follicular conjunctivitis. Haemorrhagic conjunctivitis, dry eye disease, episcleritis, or retinal involvement can also occur less frequently. There are currently no evidence-based therapy recommendations for COVID-19 associated diseases of the ocular surface. Artificial tears might be helpful for symptom relief. There is no evidence for antiviral, antibiotic, or anti-inflammatory therapies, but these medications might be used in individual cases. Potential intraocular complications include retinal artery occlusions and haemorrhages, as well as cotton wool spots caused by complement-mediated thrombotic angiopathy. Neuro-ophthalmological complications including Miller-Fisher syndrome or infarct-related central blindness can also occur in very rare cases. Knowledge of potential transmission routes and personal protective equipment is just as essential for each ophthalmologist as a basic knowledge of potential ocular symptoms and complications.","Rokohl, Alexander C; Grajewski, Rafael S; Matos, Philomena A Wawer; Kopecky, Adam; Heindl, Ludwig M; Cursiefen, Claus",Klinische Monatsblatter fur Augenheilkunde,96,1

These guidelines subsume holistic evidence based on recommendations to diagnose, treat, prevent and manage acute exacerbation with COPD. Despite the existing comprehensive recommendations, readmission rates and hospitalisations have increased in the last decade. Evidence to date has reported suboptimal clinical guidelines concordance. Acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) is a common hospital presentation due to varied causes such as infective exacerbations, worsening disease condition, medication non-adherence, lack of education and incomprehensive discharge planning. AECOPD directly and indirectly causes economic burden, disrupts health-related quality of life (HRQol), hasten lung function decline and increases overall morbidity and mortality. COPD being a multimodal chronic disease, consistent interdisciplinary interventions from the time of admission to discharge may reduce readmissions and enhance HRQol among these patients and their families. METHODS AND ANALYSIS This protocol adheres to the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology for mixed methods systematic reviews and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews reporting guidelines. Qualitative, quantitative and mixed methods studies will append this study to explore determinants of COPD guidelines concordance. Comprehensive three-tier search strategies will be used to search nine databases (COCHRANE, EBSCO HOST, MEDLINE, SCIENCE DIRECT, JBI, SCOPUS, WEB OF SCIENCE, WILEY and DARE) in May 2020. Two independent reviewers will screen abstracts and full-text articles in consonance with inclusion criteria. The convergent integrative method narrative review will contribute a deeper understanding of any discrepancies found in the existing evidence. Quality of the studies will be reported and Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) will be used as a priori to synthesis data. Identified barriers, facilitators and corresponding clinical behavioural change solutions will be categorised using TDF indicators to provide future research and implementation recommendations.

The sensing of microbes or of transformed or infected cells, through innate immune recognition receptors (referred to as activating I2R2), initiates pro-inflammatory responses and innate immune effector functions. Other I2R2 with inhibitory properties bind self-ligands constitutively expressed in host. However, this dichotomy in the recognition of foreign or induced self versus constitutive self by I2R2 is not always respected in certain non-infectious conditions reminiscent of immunopathologies. In this review, we discuss that immune mechanisms have evolved to avoid inappropriate inflammatory disorders in individuals. Molecular crossregulation exists between components of I2R2 signaling pathways, and intricate interactions between cells from both innate and adaptive immune systems set the bases of controlled immune responses. We also pinpoint that, like T or B cells, some cells of the innate immune system must go through education processes to prevent autoreactivity. In addition, we illustrate how gene expression profiling of immune cell types is a useful tool to find functional homologies between cell subsets of different species and to speculate about unidentified functions of these cells in the responses to pathogen infections.","Crozat, Karine; Vivier, Eric; Dalod, Marc",Immunological reviews,96,27

Rapidly evolving gridded agronomic models can facilitate these efforts throughout Europe. However, their performance in modelling soil carbon dynamics at regional scale is yet unexplored. Importantly, as such models are often driven by large-scale inputs, they need to be benchmarked against field experiments. We elucidate the level of detail that needs to be incorporated in gridded models to robustly estimate regional soil carbon dynamics in managed cropland, testing the approach for regions in the Czech Republic. We first calibrated the biogeochemical Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) model against long-term experiments. Subsequently, we examined the EPIC model within a top-down gridded modelling framework constructed for European agricultural soils from Europe-wide datasets and regional land-use statistics. We explored the top-down, as opposed to a bottom-up, modelling approach for reporting agronomically relevant and verifiable soil carbon dynamics. In comparison with a no-input baseline, the regional EPIC model suggested soil carbon changes (~0.1-0.5 Mg C ha-1 y-1) consistent with empirical-based studies for all studied agricultural practices. However, inaccurate soil information, crop management inputs, or inappropriate model calibration may undermine regional modelling of cropland management effect on carbon since each of the three components carry uncertainty (~0.5-1.5 Mg C ha-1 y-1) that is substantially larger than the actual effect of agricultural practices relative to the no-input baseline. Besides, inaccurate soil data obtained from the background datasets biased the simulated carbon trends compared to observations, thus hampering the model's verifiability at the locations of field experiments. Encouragingly, the top-down agricultural management derived from regional land-use statistics proved suitable for the estimation of soil carbon dynamics consistently with actual field practices. Despite sensitivity to biophysical parameters, we found a robust scalability of the soil organic carbon routine for various climatic regions and soil types represented in the Czech experiments. The model performed better than the tier 1 methodology of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which indicates a great potential for improved carbon change modelling over larger political regions.","Balkovič, Juraj; Madaras, Mikuláš; Skalský, Rastislav; Folberth, Christian; Smatanová, Michaela; Schmid, Erwin; van der Velde, Marijn; Kraxner, Florian; Obersteiner, Michael",Journal of environmental management,96,16

Publication trends and definitions were also examined, and the reason why long-distance walking may have therapeutic effects was discussed. Systematic searches in three online databases were performed using a selection of long-distance walking terms. Both quantitative and qualitative studies were included if they examined associations between long-distance walking and mental health in an adult population. Mental health was conceptualized in broad terms, including descriptions of mental states as well as more specific measurements or notions of mental health. A total of 8557 records were screened and 26 studies were included, out of which 15 were quantitative, 9 were qualitative, and 2 were mixed. The findings showed that long-distance walking was positively related to mental health. This was most consistent with regard to emotional distress compared to somewhat inconsistent findings regarding well-being. Therefore, long-distance walking may be more appropriately used to counter some personal or emotional struggle rather than to achieve hedonic pleasure.","Mau, Martin; Aaby, Anders; Klausen, Søren Harnow; Roessler, Kirsten Kaya",International journal of environmental research and public health,96,16

Besides, previous studies indicated that ACEI/ARB drugs can increase the expression of hepatic ACE2, a cell entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2. This study aims to investigate whether ACEI/ARB aggravates liver injury and the association of inflammatory cytokines and antiviral drugs with liver dysfunction in patients with hypertension and COVID-19.Method: This retrospective study included 127 hypertensive patients with long-term use or nonuse of ACEI/ARBs hospitalized for COVID-19 from January 30 to April 7, 2020, in Tongji hospital of Wuhan, China. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, treatment, and outcome data were collected.Results: Of the 127 patients with COVID-19 and hypertension, 43 taking long-term of ACEI/ARBs and 84 without using ACEI/ARBs. Abnormal liver function was observed in part of ACEI/ARB and non-ACEI/ARB users but without significant differences between these two groups. Serum inflammatory cytokines, IL-6, IL-8, and TNFα, as well as inflammation-related markers, ferritin, procalcitonin, and C-reactive protein, were significantly elevated in patients with liver dysfunction. IL-6 level was positively correlated with liver function tests on admission and highly consistent with the changes of abnormal ALT, AST, and GGT during hospitalization, but the correlations of other inflammatory cytokines were low. There was no significant association between the use of antiviral drugs and liver dysfunction in these patients.Conclusion: The elevation of inflammatory cytokine, IL-6, but not ACEI/ARB and antiviral drugs, is closely associated with liver dysfunction in patients with hypertension and COVID-19.","Xiang, Dong; Ren, Xiuhua; Chen, Qian; Yu, Hengyi; Li, Xiping; Liu, Dong",Clinical and experimental hypertension,96,26

The present study investigated the length of hospital stay (LOS), mortality, and costs of hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir or their combination in comparison with standard of care among patients hospitalised for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS This retrospective observational cohort study took place in the Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland (n = 840) between 26 February and 31 May 2020. Demographics, treatment regimens, comorbidities, the modified National Early Warning Score (mNEWS) on admission, and contraindications to COVID-19 treatment options were assessed. Outcomes included LOS, in-hospital mortality, and drug and LOS costs. RESULTS After successful propensity score matching, patients treated with (1) hydroxychloroquine, (2) lopinavir/ritonavir or (3) their combination had on average 3.75 additional hospitalisation days (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.37–6.12, p = 0.002), 1.23 additional hospitalisation days (95% CI −1.24 – 3.51, p = 0.319), and 4.19 additional hospitalisation days (95% CI 1.52–5.31, p <0.001), respectively, compared with patients treated with the standard of care. Neither experimental therapy was significantly associated with mortality. These additional hospital days amounted to 1010.77 additional days for hydroxychloroquine and hydroxychloroquine combined with lopinavir/ritonavir, resulting in an additional cost of US$ 2,492,214 (95%CI US$ 916,839–3,450,619). CONCLUSIONS Prescribing experimental therapies for COVID-19 was not associated with a reduced LOS and might have increased the pressure put on healthcare systems.","Vernaz, Nathalie; Agoritsas, Thomas; Calmy, Alexandra; Gayet-Ageron, Angèle; Gold, Gabriel; Perrier, Arnaud; Picard, Fabienne; Prendki, Virginie; Reny, Jean-Luc; Samer, Caroline; Stirnemann, Jérôme; Vetter, Pauline; Zanella, Marie-Céline; Zekry, Dina; Baggio, Stéphanie",Swiss medical weekly,96,16

PARTICIPANTS UC San Diego Student Health and Well-Being offers medical services to over 39,000 students. UC San Diego Health is an academic medical center. METHODS 20 workstreams and 9 electronic modules, systems, or interfaces were converted to new electronic systems. RESULTS 36,023 student-patient medical records were created. EHR-integration increased security while creating visibility to 19,700 shared patient visits and records from 236 health systems across the country over 6 months. Benefits for the COVID-19 response included access to screening tools, decision support, telehealth, patient alerting system, reporting and analytics, COVID-19 dashboard, and increased testing capabilities. CONCLUSION Integration of an interoperable EHR between neighboring campus-based health services and an affiliated academic medical center can streamline case management, improve quality and safety, and increase access to valuable health resources in times of need.

Memory B cells are immortalized with high efficiency using Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in the presence of a toll-like receptor (TLR) agonist, while plasma cells are maintained in single-cell cultures by using interleukin 6 (IL-6) or stromal cells. In both cases, multiple parallel assays, including functional assays, can be used to identify rare cells that produce antibodies with unique properties. Using these methods, we have isolated potent and broadly neutralizing antibodies against a variety of viruses, in particular, a pan-influenza-A-neutralizing antibody and an antibody that neutralizes four different paramyxoviruses. Given the high throughput and the possibility of directly screening for function (rather than just binding), these methods are instrumental to implement a target-agnostic approach to identify the most effective antibodies and, consequently, the most promising targets for vaccine design. This approach is exemplified by the identification of unusually potent cytomegalovirus-neutralizing antibodies that led to the identification of the target, a pentameric complex that we are developing as a candidate vaccine.","Corti, Davide; Lanzavecchia, Antonio",Microbiology spectrum,96,28

Alendronate (ALN) is a potent inhibitor of osteoclastic bone resorption and results in reduced bone remodeling. This study investigated the effects of pre-emptive use of ALN on OA related osteoclastic subchondral bone resorption in an in vivo rat model for severe OA. Using multi-modality imaging we measured effects of ALN treatment within cartilage and synovium. Severe osteoarthritis was induced in left rat knees using papain injections in combination with a moderate running protocol. Twenty rats were treated with subcutaneous ALN injections and compared to twenty untreated controls. Animals were longitudinally monitored for 12weeks with in vivo μCT to measure subchondral bone changes and SPECT/CT to determine synovial macrophage activation using a folate-based radiotracer. Articular cartilage was analyzed at 6 and 12weeks with ex vivo contrast enhanced μCT and histology to measure sulfated-glycosaminoglycan (sGAG) content and cartilage thickness. ALN treatment successfully inhibited subchondral bone remodeling. As a result we found less subchondral plate porosity and reduced osteophytosis. ALN treatment did not reduce subchondral sclerosis. However, after the OA induction phase, ALN treatment protected cartilage ECM from degradation and reduced synovial macrophage activation. Surprisingly, ALN treatment also improved sGAG content of tibia cartilage in healthy joints. Our data was consistent with the hypothesis that osteoclastic bone resorption might play an important role in OA and may be a driving force for progression of the disease. However, our study suggest that this effect might not solely be effects on osteoclastic activity, since ALN treatment also influenced macrophage functioning. Additionally, ALN treatment and physical activity exercised a positive effect in healthy control joints, which increased cartilage sGAG content. More research on this topic might lead to novel insights as to improve cartilage quality.","Siebelt, M; Waarsing, J H; Groen, H C; Müller, C; Koelewijn, S J; de Blois, E; Verhaar, J A N; de Jong, M; Weinans, H",Bone,96,17

The available literature data derived from controlled studies or usage in a medical setting seem reassuring; however the literature contains very rare cases of fatal self-inflicted injuries associated with LSD exposure. The behavioral disorder that created the conditions conducive to death is a maladaptive or irrational response to the psychiatric manifestations induced by the substance. PATIENT CONCERN Here, we report the case of a 26-year-old man found dead with large neck wounds in a locked house. No medical history other than recreational use of alcohol and narcotics was reported as well as any history of psychotic disease. The entirety of the other investigations carried out did not demonstrate the presence of a third party at the place of death and a dropper bottle containing LSD was found near the body. DIAGNOSIS We report the first case of fatal self-inflicted neck wounds with a cutting instrument in the context of acute exposure to LSD in a patient with no psychiatric history and without suicidal symptoms at the time of the self-aggressive act. INTERVENTION AND OUTCOMES In the present work, we used a validated method using liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry for simultaneous quantification of LSD and its metabolites (O-H-LSD and Nor-LSD) in whole blood and urine samples. LSD and O-H-LSD were respectively found at 1460 and 182 pg/mL in blood. In the urine, the concentrations of LSD, nor-LSD, O-H-LSD were, respectively, 3670, 201, and 4890 ng/L. LESSONS This observation is particularly relevant in view of the resurgence of interest in the therapeutic use of LSD, notwithstanding the fact that the literature has not demonstrated a link between suicidal risk and acute or chronic exposure to LSD.","Le Daré, Brendan; Gicquel, Thomas; Baert, Alain; Morel, Isabelle; Bouvet, Renaud",Medicine,96,19

Its use has also been described to seal off an annulotomy after a transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion when recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2) is used. This aids in the reduction of postoperative radiculitis caused by rhBMP-2. However, as a result of its hydrophilic properties, DuraSeal(™) has the potential to swell, which could lead to compression of the thecal sac. CASE DESCRIPTION We report a 57-year-old woman who developed cauda equina after a transforaminal lumbar 47 interbody fusion (TLIF) procedure in which the expansion of the DuraSeal(™) was believed to be the causative factor. The patient developed urinary retention, bowel incontinence, and paresthesias in the saddle region on postoperative Day 3. She underwent emergent exploration and decompression of the thecal sac. The gel-like DuraSeal™ material was causing significant compression of the thecal sac. LITERATURE REVIEW Multiple reports have documented that DuraSeal(™), used as an adjunct to dural repair, can swell leading to compression of the spinal cord and/or neural elements. Our case demonstrates the use of DuraSeal(™) both over a site of a dural repair and over an annulotomy site, through which a TLIF was performed, is associated with the risk of developing postoperative cauda equina syndrome as a result of swelling of the DuraSeal(™). CLINICAL RELEVANCE Those using DuraSeal™ to seal off the annulotomy after a TLIF procedure performed with rhBMP-2 should use the product with an understanding of the potential postoperative swelling of the product and resulting neurologic sequela, particularly if DuraSeal(™) is used concomitantly at the site of dural repair.","Neuman, Brian J; Radcliff, Kristen; Rihn, Jeffery",Clinical orthopaedics and related research,96,16

In this study, we tried to identify the cellular target of grincamycin B (GCN B), one of most dominant and active secondary metabolites, using a combined strategy. We showed that GCN B-selective-induced apoptosis of human acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cell line NB4 through increase of ER stress and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation. Using a strategy of combining phenotype, transcriptomics and protein microarray approaches, we identified that isocitrate dehydrogenase 1(IDH1) was the putative target of GCN B, and confirmed that GCNs were a subset of selective inhibitors targeting both wild-type and mutant IDH1 in vitro. It is well-known that IDH1 converts isocitrate to 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG), maintaining intracellular 2-OG homeostasis. IDH1 and its mutant as the target of GCN B were validated in NB4 cells and zebrafish model. Knockdown of IDH1 in NB4 cells caused the similar phenotype as GCN B treatment, and supplementation of N-acetylcysteine partially rescued the apoptosis caused by IDH1 interference in NB4 cells. In zebrafish model, GCN B effectively restored myeloid abnormality caused by overexpression of mutant IDH1(R132C). Taken together, we demonstrate that IDH1 is one of the antitumor targets of GCNs, suggesting wild-type IDH1 may be a potential target for hematological malignancies intervention in the future.","Wang, Zheng; Li, Zeng-Xia; Zhao, Wen-Cao; Huang, Hong-Bo; Wang, Jia-Qi; Zhang, Hao; Lu, Jun-Yan; Wang, Rui-Na; Li, Wei; Cheng, Zhao; Xu, Wen-Long; Di Zhu,; Zhou, Li-Sha; Jiang, Wei; Yu, Long; Liu, Jun-Yan; Luo, Cheng; Zhu, Heng; Dan Ye,; Pan, Wei-Jun; Ju, Jian-Hua; Dang, Yong-Jun",Acta pharmacologica Sinica,96,5

Current policy places generalists at the centre of palliative care provision. However, little is known about how patients and carers understand the general practitioner's role. AIMS To explore patient and carer perspectives of (1) the role of the general practitioner in providing palliative care to adult patients and (2) the facilitators and barriers to the general practitioner's capacity to fulfil this perceived role. DESIGN Systematic literature review and narrative synthesis. DATA SOURCES Seven electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, BNI, CINAHL, Cochrane and HMIC) were searched from inception to May 2017. Two reviewers independently screened papers at title, abstract and full-text stages. Grey literature, guideline, hand searches of five journals and reference list/citation searches of included papers were undertaken. Data were extracted, tabulated and synthesised using narrative, thematic analysis. RESULTS A total of 25 studies were included: 14 employed qualitative methods, 8 quantitative survey methods and 3 mixed-methods. Five key themes were identified: continuity of care, communication between primary and secondary care, contact and accessibility, communication between general practitioner and patient, and knowledge and competence. CONCLUSION Although the terminology and context of general practice vary internationally, themes relating to the perceived role of general practitioners were consistent. General practitioners are considered well placed to provide palliative care due to their breadth of clinical responsibility, ongoing relationships with patients and families, and duty to visit patients at home and coordinate healthcare resources. These factors, valued by service users, should influence future practice and policy development.","Green, Emilie; Knight, Selena; Gott, Merryn; Barclay, Stephen; White, Patrick",Palliative medicine,96,14

METHODS All patients who had open (suture or mesh) and laparoscopic repair of primary PUH in the Day Surgery Unit (DSU) between January 2007 and June 2009 were identified from the hospital database. The database was questioned regarding the grade of operating surgeon, type of surgical repair, day of admission and discharge from the DSU, and a patient's return to surgical services. Data were stored in Microsoft Excel(®) (TM 2007). Statistical significance was determined using Fisher's exact test. RESULTS PUH was repaired in 337 patients: 252/337 (74.8 %) had open and 85/337 (25.2 %) had laparoscopic repair. Significantly, more patients were discharged home on the day of surgery after an open repair compared to the laparoscopic repair: open repair 187/252 (74.2 %), laparoscopic repair 35/85 (41.17 %), P = 0.0001. Overall early complications such as wound complications and hospital re-visits were similar in both groups: open repair 6.3 % (16/252), laparoscopic repair 11.7 % (10/85), P = 0.1554. STs performed 142/337 (42.1 %) of the PUH repairs with similar same day discharges from the DSU: STs 64.7 % (92/142), consultant surgeons 66.7 % (130/195), P = 0.7285. The difference in hernia recurrence between open repair 7/252 (2.78 %) and laparoscopic group 0/85 was not significant (P = 0.1985). CONCLUSION Patients with PUH repair were more likely to go home on the day of surgery after open than after laparoscopic repair. This was not affected by the grade of the operating surgeon. Early complications were similar following open and laparoscopic repair of primary PUH.","Shaikh, I; Willder, J M; Kumar, S",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,96,33

The disease is characterized by airway inflammation with involvement of multiple biological pathways. Genetic predisposition and increased susceptibility to severe respiratory viral infections are well known clinical features of asthma. Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved cellular degradation process with significant impact on immunity and antiviral response. In this review we have described the role of autophagy in immune cell survival, proliferation and function. Autophagy has complex effects on immune response involved in inflammation, specifically Th2 immune response. Common respiratory viruses are associated with increased morbidity and mortality in asthmatic patients. RECENT FINDINGS We describe recent studies showing the effect of autophagy on replication and immune response to common respiratory viruses. The role of autophagy in asthma has recently been investigated. Two studies have been published describing the association of autophagy with asthma. Genetic polymorphism in specific autophagy genes is associated with asthma and influences gene expression in an experimental in-vivo model. SUMMARY These studies provide us with a window into the possible role of autophagy in asthma and offer new clues to pathogenesis. Modulation of autophagy has the potential to develop into a new therapeutic avenue to treat this common respiratory ailment.","Jyothula, Soma S S K; Eissa, N Tony",Current opinion in pulmonary medicine,96,12

Based on selected articles, this review deals with the potential antiviral and virucidal activities of essential oils and essential oil compounds together with their mechanism of action as well as in silico studies involving viral and host cell-specific target molecules that are indispensable for virus cell adsorption, penetration, and replication. The reported in vitro and in vivo studies highlight the baseline data about the latest findings of essential oils and essential oil compounds antiviral and virucidal effects on enveloped and non-enveloped viruses, taking into account available biochemical and molecular biological tests. The results of many in vitro studies revealed that several essential oils and essential oil compounds from different medicinal and aromatic plants are potent antiviral and virucidal agents that inhibit viral progeny by blocking different steps of the viral infection/replication cycle of DNA and RNA viruses in various host cell lines. Studies in mice infected with viruses causing respiratory diseases showed that different essential oils and essential oil compounds were able to prolong the life of infected animals, reduce virus titers in brain and lung tissues, and significantly inhibit the synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. In addition, some in vitro studies on hydrophilic nano-delivery systems encapsulating essential oils/essential oil compounds exhibited a promising way to improve the chemical stability and enhance the water solubility, bioavailabilty, and antiviral efficacy of essential oils and essential oil compounds.","Reichling, Jürgen",Planta medica,96,1

METHODS We performed a cross-sectional evaluation of patient perceptions of the Inflammatory Rasch-built Overall Disability Scale (I-RODS) from 41 subjects with CIDP through a structured questionnaire. We assessed perceived hesitation to provide a response, item importance and relevance, understanding of specific items and factors affecting responses. RESULTS Hesitation to provide a categorical answer was reported by 20% of subjects or more, for 5/24 (20.8%) items. Uncertainty was most frequent for ""travel by public transport"" (22.4%) and ""catch an object (e.g. ball)"" (24%). Six of 24 (25%) items were perceived as unimportant to their disease by at least a third of participants. Items most commonly perceived as unimportant were ""travel by public transport"" in 53.7%, ""catch an object e.g. ball"" in 61%, ""dance"" in 65.9%. Several items were frequently perceived as irrelevant. These included ""move a chair"" (39%), ""do the dishes"" (46.3%), ""catch an object e.g. ball"" (61%), ""travel by public transport"" (68.3%), and ""stand for hours"" (82.9%). The understanding of multiple items such as ""read a book"", ""sit on a toilet"" and ""take a shower"" was found highly variable. Fatigue was perceived more commonly than mood (53.7% vs.17.1%, p=0.001), and more commonly in younger subjects (p=0.037), as influencing responses to the I-RODS. DISCUSSION Patient-perceived uncertainty, unimportance, irrelevance and poor understanding of items as well as fatigue and mood, impact on the value of the I-RODS.

RECENT FINDINGS Recent advancements in molecular diagnostics have resulted in the detection of higher rates of CARVs in LTRs. Persistence of rhinovirus has been implicated in the development of acute and chronic rejection, whereas the role of bocavirus remains uncertain. The data on the association of CARV infections with acute or chronic rejection remain less. A recent systematic review failed to show an association between CARV infections and acute or chronic rejection. Different routes of administration of antiviral medications, vaccines and newer promising antiviral medications are being evaluated to assess efficacy and safety. Similarly, newer strategies of vaccination may potentiate the immune response in these patients. SUMMARY With current advanced investigating tools, the full impact of CARV infections in LTR is increasingly coming to realization. Research for novel effective treatments and improved responses to current and new vaccines is ongoing; they would provide great benefit in solving this complex and ever-evolving problem.","Shalhoub, Sarah; Husain, Shahid",Current opinion in infectious diseases,96,15

Therefore, there is a need to investigate techniques that might further reduce postoperative pain. This study assessed the safety and efficacy of using a transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. METHODS Forty-six patients were analyzed in the trial and were randomized to undergo the TAP block procedure with either bupivacaine (n=24) or saline placebo (Control n=22) injected into the muscle plane. Prefilled syringes were dispensed with the group allocation concealed to maintain blinding. After surgery, the amount of morphine, level of pain, and measures of recovery were recorded. RESULTS The amount of morphine used 6 hr after surgery was significantly lower in patients receiving TAP block with bupivacaine compared with the control (presented as mean [SD], 12.4 [8.4] vs. 21.2 [14.0] mg; P=0.015). However, the total amount of morphine used was similar in both groups 45.6 [31.4] vs. 52.7 [28.8] mg; P=0.771. Patients in the bupivacaine group experienced significantly less pain on postoperative days 1 (score, 19 [15] vs. 37 [20]; P=0.003) and 2 (score, 11 [10] vs. 19 [13]; P=0.031). Recovery and postoperative hospital stay were similar in both groups. There were no complications associated with the procedure. CONCLUSION The TAP block procedure is beneficial in reducing postoperative pain and early morphine requirements in laparoscopic live-donor nephrectomy.","Hosgood, Sarah A; Thiyagarajan, Umasanker M; Nicholson, Harriet F L; Jeyapalan, Inthira; Nicholson, Michael L",Transplantation,96,4

Not detected were Coronavirus, Cardiovirus, Cosavirus, Salivirus, Sapovirus, and Norovirus. Long-term virus shedding, lasting from one to 12 months, was observed for adenoviruses, anelloviruses, bocaviruses, enteroviruses, parechoviruses, and picobirnaviruses. Repeated administration of oral poliovirus vaccine resulted in progressively shorter periods of poliovirus detection. Four nonpolio enterovirus genotypes were also detected. An average of 1.8 distinct human viruses were found per time point. Ninety-two percent (66/72) of the fecal samples tested contained one to five different human viruses. Two British siblings in the mid-1980s showed nearly constant fecal viral shedding.

Hence, an effective model to predict VAP in ARDS is urgently needed. METHODS We performed a secondary analysis of patient-level data from the Early versus Delayed Enteral Nutrition (EDEN) of ARDSNet randomized controlled trials. Multivariate binary logistic regression analysis established a predictive model, incorporating characteristics selected by systematic review and univariate analyses. The model's discrimination, calibration, and clinical usefulness were assessed using the C-index, calibration plot, and decision curve analysis (DCA). RESULTS Of the 1000 unique patients enrolled in the EDEN trials, 70 (7%) had ARDS complicated with VAP. Mechanical ventilation duration and intensive care unit (ICU) stay were significantly longer in the VAP group than non-VAP group (P < .001 for both) but the 60-day mortality was comparable. Use of neuromuscular blocking agents, severe ARDS, admission for unscheduled surgery, and trauma as primary ARDS causes were independent risk factors for VAP. The area under the curve of the model was .744, and model fit was acceptable (Hosmer-Lemeshow P = .185). The calibration curve indicated that the model had proper discrimination and good calibration. DCA showed that the VAP prediction nomogram was clinically useful when an intervention was decided at a VAP probability threshold between 1% and 61%. CONCLUSIONS The prediction nomogram for VAP development in ARDS patients can be applied after ICU admission, using available variables. Potential clinical benefits of using this model deserve further assessment.","Wu, Zongsheng; Liu, Yao; Xu, Jingyuan; Xie, Jianfeng; Zhang, Shi; Huang, Lili; Huang, Yingzi; Yang, Yi; Qiu, Haibo",Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,96,30

However, the results from these studies are inconsistent in terms of efficacy and safety to reach a clinical decision. The objective of this study was to systematically review the randomized controlled trials comparing the efficacy and safety of fondaparinux and LMWH for perioperative surgical thromboprophylaxis. Methods and Results Systematic search in various databases was done to identify randomized controlled trials comparing fondaparinux and LMWH published during the years 2000 to 2017. Outcomes of interest in this study included venous thromboembolism up to day 15, all-cause mortality up to day 90, major bleeding, and minor bleeding during the treatment period. Analyses were performed with the relative odds based on a random-effects model using Mantel-Haenszel statistics. Results were presented as odds ratios with their 95% CIs. The assessment of study quality was performed as per Cochrane collaboration. After screening 10 644 articles, 12 randomized controlled trials including 14 906 patients were included in the final analyses. Pooled analyses showed the odds of venous thromboembolism in the fondaparinux group were 0.49 times the odds in LMWH group ( OR =0.49 [0.38-0.64]). However, the odds of major bleeding in the fondaparinux group were 1.48 times the odds in the LMWH group ( OR =1.48 [1.15-1.90]). Conclusions Fondaparinux was associated with a superior efficacy in terms of reduction of venous thromboembolism in this meta-analysis. However, it was also associated with increased odds of major bleeding.","Kumar, Arun; Talwar, Ashna; Farley, Joel F; Muzumdar, Jagannath; Schommer, Jon C; Balkrishnan, Rajesh; Wu, Wenchen",Journal of the American Heart Association,96,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective analysis was conducted over a period of 52 months in 18 consecutive patients (17 men; mean age +/- SD, 70 years +/- 11) undergoing ET of PAAs with the Viabahn endograft in a single center. Patient symptoms, aneurysm characteristics, technical outcomes, complications, and follow-up were assessed. RESULTS Aneurysm diameters ranged from 12 to 51 mm with a mean of 30 mm (+/-11). Thirteen aneurysms (72.2%) were partially thrombosed and 12 patients (66.6%) had symptoms of lower limb ischemia at presentation (11 chronic and one acute). The technical success rate was 94%. Intraprocedural emboli and endoleak occurred in one and two patients, respectively. Fourteen patients were available for follow-up after successful treatment, with a mean follow-up time of 15 months (range, 7-37 months). All stent-grafts were patent after 1 month, with no mortality or limb loss. The primary patency rate with complete exclusion of the aneurysm at 6 months was 86%. Pre- and postprocedural noninvasive arterial studies were available in 10 patients, demonstrating improvement of the ankle-brachial index from 0.96 +/- 0.41 to 1.17 +/- 0.18, respectively (P = .06).

The detection indexes included serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), albumin (ALB), and total bilirubin (TBIL). RESULTS A total of 49.1% of the COVID-19 patients had liver injury. There were significant difference in the ALT, AST, ALB (all P<0.05), but there was no significant difference in the TBIL (P>0.05) between the severe (critical) patients and the general (light) patients. There was also no significant difference in the liver function injury between the HBsAg-positive COVID-19 patients and HBsAg-negative COVID-19 patients (P>0.05). Acute liver injury was not found to be a direct cause of death in the patients. CONCLUSIONS In the COVID-19 patients, the incidence of liver injury is high with the increase of ALT and AST and the decrease of ALB. Severe and critical patients have obvious liver injury, and those patients complicated with hepatitis B virus infection don't show aggravated liver injury.","Wen, Ming; Lu, Jin; Xie, Yuanlin",Zhong nan da xue xue bao.

Preclinical investigations and pilot clinical data have demonstrated that Affibody molecules provide high contrast imaging of tumor-associated molecular targets shortly after injection. The use of cysteine-containing peptide-based chelators at the C-terminus of recombinant Affibody molecules enabled site-specific labeling with the radionuclide 99mTc. Earlier studies have demonstrated that position, composition and the order of amino acids in peptide-based chelators influence labeling stability, cellular processing and biodistribution of Affibody molecules. To investigate the influence of the amino acid order, a series of anti-HER2 Affibody molecules, containing GSGC, GEGC and GKGC chelators have been prepared and characterized. The affinity to HER2, cellular processing of 99mTc-labeled Affibody molecules and their biodistribution were investigated. These properties were compared with that of the previously studied 99mTc-labeled Affibody molecules containing GGSC, GGEC and GGKC chelators. All variants displayed picomolar affinities to HER2. The substitution of a single amino acid in the chelator had an appreciable influence on the cellular processing of 99mTc. The biodistribution of all 99mTc-labeled Affibody molecules was in general comparable, with the main difference in uptake and retention of radioactivity in excretory organs. The hepatic accumulation of radioactivity was higher for the lysine-containing chelators and the renal retention of 99mTc was significantly affected by the amino acid composition of chelators. The order of amino acids influenced renal uptake of some conjugates at 1 h after injection, but the difference decreased at later time points. Such information can be helpful for the development of other scaffold protein-based imaging and therapeutic radiolabeled conjugates.","Altai, Mohamed; Wållberg, Helena; Orlova, Anna; Rosestedt, Maria; Hosseinimehr, Seyed Jalal; Tolmachev, Vladimir; Ståhl, Stefan",Amino acids,96,31

Objectives The objective was to assess the distribution and growth rate of COVID-19 infection in Tamil Nadu, India. Methods The data on the number of infections of COVID-19 have been obtained from the media reports released by the Government of Tamil Nadu. The data contain information on the incidence of the disease for the first 41 days of the outbreak started on March 7, 2020. Log-linear model has been used to estimate the progression of the COVID-19 infection in Tamil Nadu. Separate models were employed to model the growth rate and decay rate of the disease. Spatial Poisson regression was used to identify the high-risk areas in the state. Results : The models estimated the doubling time for the number of cases in growth phase as 3.96 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.70, 9.42) days and halving time in the decay phase as 12.08 (95% CI: 6.79, 54.78) days.

In the Harmonizing Outcomes With Revascularization and Stents in Acute Myocardial Infarction (HORIZONS-AMI) trial, bivalirudin after pretreatment with clopidogrel resulted in improved net clinical outcome compared with heparin plus glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors. However, during the first 24 hours after PCI, there was an increase in stent thrombosis rates with bivalirudin. In the Trial to Assess Improvement in Therapeutic Outcomes by Optimizing Platelet Inhibition With Prasugrel-Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (TRITON-TIMI) 38 trial, prasugrel was superior to clopidogrel in patients with acute coronary syndrome with and without ST-segment elevation.

An emphasis on encounter data renders it challenging for social workers (SWs) to communicate statistically compelling explanations of contributions to team-based care and overall value to the health system. This paper reports outcomes of feasibility, acceptability, and appropriateness of integrating a validated psychosocial acuity metric into standardized social work (SW) documentation at a large, pediatric quaternary hospital in the northeastern United States. Approximately 20% (N = 42) of departmental SWs participated in an open pilot trial wherein participants were first trained in scale administration, utilized it for a circumscribed period following training, and evaluated implementation outcomes. Across five unique practice settings, results showed that the metric was feasible, acceptable and appropriate for use; 78% of participants were in favor of integrating it into the EMR interface as a required component of SW documentation. Assessing psychosocial acuity in every documented patient encounter facilitates intermittent review of psychosocial acuity at individual, setting, and programmatic levels and opportunities to evaluate how SW interventions address psychosocial acuity.","Sable, Paige; Ross, Abigail; Clock, Annie; Corder, Brooke; Lamontagne, Nicole; McCaig, Jessica; Shanske, Susan; Tvedte, Matthew; Cummings, Jennifer; Chamorro, Pamela",Social work in health care,96,1

Here we show that deletion of core clock components REV-ERBα and β in adult mouse hepatocytes disrupted diurnal rhythms of a subset of liver genes and altered the diurnal rhythm of de novo lipogenesis. Liver function is also influenced by non-hepatocytic cells, and the loss of hepatocyte REV-ERBs remodeled the rhythmic transcriptomes and metabolomes of multiple cell types within the liver. Finally, alteration of food availability demonstrated the hierarchy of the cell-intrinsic hepatocyte clock mechanism and the feeding environment. Together, these studies reveal previously unsuspected roles of the hepatocyte clock in the physiological coordination of nutritional signals and cell-cell communication controlling rhythmic metabolism.","Guan, Dongyin; Xiong, Ying; Trinh, Trang Minh; Xiao, Yang; Hu, Wenxiang; Jiang, Chunjie; Dierickx, Pieterjan; Jang, Cholsoon; Rabinowitz, Joshua D; Lazar, Mitchell A",Science,96,28

MGCTs also have a predilection for patients with Klinefelter syndrome and possibly other genetic conditions. MGCTs, as GCTs at other extragonadal sites, are thought to arise from germ cells improperly retained during migration along the midline during embryogenesis. Similar to their counterparts in the testes, MGCTs are classified into seminomatous and nonseminomatous GCTs. Seminomatous MGCT represents pure seminoma, whereas nonseminomatous MGCTs encompass pure yolk sac tumors, embryonal carcinoma, choriocarcinoma, mature or immature teratoma, and mixed GCTs with any combination of GCT types, including seminoma. Somatic-type or hematologic malignancies can also occur in association with a primary MGCT. MGCTs share molecular findings with GCTs at other sites, most commonly the presence of chromosome 12p gains and isochromosome i(12p). Treatment includes neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgical resection of residual tumor, with the exception of benign teratomas, which require only surgical resection without chemotherapy. In this review, we highlight and provide an update on pathologic, clinical, and molecular features of MGCTs. Immunohistochemical profiles of each tumor type, as well as differential diagnostic considerations, are discussed.","El-Zaatari, Ziad M; Ro, Jae Y",Advances in anatomic pathology,96,12

COVID-19 crisis from the very beginning has been followed by divisive and disruptive psychosocial and political blame games. Active or passive blaming is an inherent feature of human beings in order to shift responsibilities onto others, single out a culprit, find a scapegoat and pinpoint a target. Finger pointing, blame games and scapegoating are associated with creation of binaries that identify agency as good or bad, right or wrong, moral or immoral. The scapegoat is expectedly always bad, wrong and immoral, commonly black evil. The detrimental effects of the COVID-19 blame games are seen in a lack of cohesion and coherence in the anti-COVID-19 solving strategies. Fighting the COVID-19 crisis all countries and nations need to join efforts on defeating it and to shift from a destructive blaming and zero-sum type of thinking to a much more creative, systemic and humanistic type. Effective response to COVID-19 is related to sowing the seeds for humanistic self and empathic civilization, rather than blaming, scapegoating and xenophobia.","Jakovljevic, Miro; Jakovljevic, Ivan; Bjedov, Sarah; Mustac, Filip",Psychiatria Danubina,96,31

RECENT FINDINGS A single outbreak report is likely be influenced by the local setting. In contrast, a systematic analysis of a large number of similar outbreaks draws a much better picture of the real conditions on the pathogen's reservoirs, on modes of transmission, and on appropriate infection control measures to prevent the spread of the microorganism. Isolation, unit closures, sick leave, cleaning, and diagnostic/therapeutic measures may lead to enormous costs during an outbreak. Thus, cost calculations of outbreaks should be performed to justify future expenses for infection control. Mathematic modeling is a fairly new approach to estimate the risk of pathogen transmission in outbreak settings. Examples are shown to differentiate between epidemic and sporadic infections and to evaluate the influence of infection control interventions. SUMMARY Outbreak reports may add some very important information to the understanding of transmission and infection control. There is a need for a more structured publication of nosocomial outbreaks to ensure that no key data are lacking in the article.","Gastmeier, Petra; Vonberg, Ralf-Peter",Current opinion in infectious diseases,96,16

Validation of the model is possible within the range of alveolar gas compositions compatible with consciousness. Within this range, the experimental data are compatible with the proposed model. The model with its characteristics may allow predictions of alveolar gas composition whenever the alveolar ventilation goes to zero, e.g. static and dynamic breath holding at the surface or during ventilation/intubation failure in anaesthesia. ABSTRACT Purpose In the hypothesis that alveolar O2 and CO2 partial pressures during breath holding (BH) should vary following a hypoventilation loop, we modelled the alveolar gas pathways during BH on the O2 -CO2 diagram and experimentally tested it during ambient air and pure oxygen breathing. Methods In air, the model was constructed using: the inspired and the alveolar partial pressures of O2 (PI O2 and PA O2 ) and of CO2 (PI CO2 and PA CO2 ), and the steady state values of pre-BH respiratory exchange ratio (RER). In pure oxygen, the model respected the constraint of PA CO2 = -PA O2 + PI O2 . To test this, 12 subjects performed several BH of increasing duration plus one maximal at rest and exercise (30W cycling supine), while breathing air or pure oxygen. We measured gas flows, PA O2 and PA CO2 before and at the end of all BH. Measured data were fitted through the model. Results In air, PI O2 = 150 ± 1 mmHg and PI CO2 = 0.3 ± 0.0 mmHg both at rest and at 30W. Before BH, steady state RER was 0.83 ± 0.16 at rest and 0.77 ± 0.14 at 30W; PA O2 = 107 ± 7 mmHg at rest and 102 ± 8 mmHg at 30W; and PA CO2 = 36 ± 4 mmHg at rest and 38 ± 3 mmHg at 30W. By model fitting we computed RER during early phase of BH: 0.10 (95%CI = 0.08-0.12) at rest and 0.13 (95%CI = 0.11-0.15) at 30W. In oxygen, model fitting provided PI O2 : 692 (95%CI = 688-696) mmHg at rest and 693 (95%CI = 689-698) mmHg at 30W. Conclusion The experimental data are compatible with the proposed model, within its physiological range. This article is protected by copyright.

The records from World Health Organisation (WHO), Centres of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) backup the fact that no medications have proven to be completely effective for prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2. The clinical trials are underway for many repurposed, investigational drugs and vaccine candidates. BioNTech and Pfizer Inc, Moderna, Gamaleya institute and University of Oxford (collaboration with AstraZeneca) announced positive results in the Phase 3 interim analyses of vaccine trials in November 2020. Twelve countries have approved Pfizer- BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use, as of December 2020.

Risk factors for mortality have not been well summarized. Current meta-analysis of retrospective cohort studies was done to summarize available findings on the association between age, gender, comorbidities and risk of death from COVID-19 infection.Methods: Online databases including Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library and Google scholar were searched to detect relevant publications up to 1 May 2020, using relevant keywords. To pool data, random-effects model was used. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis and publication bias test were also done.Results: In total, 14 studies with 29,909 COVID-19 infected patients and 1445 cases of death were included in the current meta-analysis. Significant associations were found between older age (≥65 vs <65 years old) (pooled ORs = 4.59, 95%CIs = 2.61-8.04, p < .001), gender (male vs female) (pooled ORs = 1.50, 95%CIs = 1.06-2.12, p = .021) and risk of death from COVID-19 infection. In addition, hypertension (pooled ORs = 2.70, 95%CIs = 1.40-5.24, p = .003), cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) (pooled ORs = 3.72, 95%CIs = 1.77-7.83, p = .001), diabetes (pooled ORs = 2.41, 95%CIs = 1.05-5.51, p = .037), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (pooled ORs = 3.53, 95%CIs = 1.79-6.96, p < .001) and cancer (pooled ORs = 3.04, 95%CIs = 1.80-5.14, p < .001), were associated with higher risk of mortality.Conclusions: Older age (≥65 years old), male gender, hypertension, CVDs, diabetes, COPD and malignancies were associated with greater risk of death from COVID-19 infection.

MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 265 patients with pathologically confirmed locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (stage II-IV), including 115 treated with gemcitabine plus cisplatin (GP group) and 150 treated with docetaxel plus cisplatin (TP group) were retrospectively enrolled. Radiomics features were extracted from the volume of interest delineated in multi-MR sequences on a 3T scanner. After random stratified grouping (training and validation cohorts) and logistic regression based on selected features, the association between the radiomics signature and the early response to induction chemotherapy were established for GP and TP regiments, respectively. RESULTS Clinical factors showed no significant difference between the response and non-response groups for the GP and TP regiments (all p > 0.05). The accuracy of the radiomics signature consisting of selected features from the joint T1, T2, and T1C in the GP group (0.852 in the training cohort vs. 0.853 in the validation cohort) was significantly higher than that in the TP group (0.774 vs 0.727). The overall performance of the GP model was steady, with efficiency to distinguish responders from nonresponders with an AUC reaching 0.907 (95% confidence interval [CI] [0.843-0.970]) in the training cohort and 0.886 (95% CI [0.772-0.998]) in the validation cohort, while leveling at 0.800 (95% CI [0.712-0.888]) in the training cohort and 0.863 (95% CI [0.758-0.967]) in the validation cohort in the TP group. CONCLUSION Pretreatment MR radiomics signature can better predict the early response to IC in the GP regimen than the TP regimen, which may be helpful to guide IC management.","Zhang, Lei; Ye, Zhimin; Ruan, Lei; Jiang, Mingxiang",Academic radiology,96,27

RECENT FINDINGS The use of EIT in clinical practice is supported by several studies demonstrating good correlation between impedance tomography data and other validated methods of assessing lung aeration during mechanical ventilation. Similarly, LUS also correlates with chest computed tomography in assessing lung aeration, its changes and several pathological conditions, with superiority over other techniques. Other PoCUS applications have shown to effectively complement the LUS ultrasound assessment of the mechanically ventilated patient.

This study aimed to address the dearth in investigational objective data surrounding PTT release to better quantify the postoperative impacts of frenotomy for ankyloglossia. STUDY DESIGN Prospective randomized, controlled trial. SETTING Private practice clinic. METHODS In a prospective, randomized controlled trial, infants 3 to 16 weeks of age with PTT undergoing frenotomy were examined using a bottle-feeding system capable of objectively measuring tongue function. Validated patient-reported outcome measures were also obtained simultaneously. RESULTS Forty-seven infants with PTT were enrolled into an observational/control arm (n = 23) or interventional/surgical treatment arm (n = 24). The total cohort consisted of 29 (61.7%) male infants with a median age of 39 days. At the day 10 time point, the interventional arm demonstrated statistically significant improvement in 11 objectively obtained feeding metrics, indicating faster tongue speed, more rhythmic and coordinated sucking motions, and a tongue more capable of adapting to varying feeding demands. Significant improvement in breastfeeding self-efficacy was reported in the interventional group while poor self-confidence persisted in the observational group. Infant reflux symptoms improved in the interventional group while not in the control group. Nipple pain also persisted in the control group but improved in the surgical cohort. CONCLUSIONS When measured 10 days after frenotomy for PTT, infants improve feeding parameters using an objective bottle-feeding system. Similar improvements are seen with patient-reported outcomes when PTT is released. Posterior tongue-tie is a valid clinical concern, and surgical release can improve infant and maternal symptoms.","Ghaheri, Bobak A; Lincoln, Douglas; Mai, Tuyet Nhi T; Mace, Jess C",Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,96,1

We evaluated VT error in 3 common ICU ventilators. METHODS Simulated patient: 60kg adult with ARDS using IngMar Medical ASL 5000 having moderate inspiratory effort. Ventilators evaluated: Covidien PB 840, Maquet Servo-i, and Dräger Evita XL, PC breaths at preset inspiratory time (TI) 0.6-1.4s. VT error was defined as ventilator displayed VT minus the simulator displayed VT (mL/kg or % of true). RESULTS Relaxation of inspiratory effort caused flow reversal (exhalation) during TI, which led to VT error. For the PB 840, VT error was proportional to TI (maximum -2.0mL/kg, -19%). For the Servo-i, VT error was not related to TI (maximum error -0.2mL/kg or -1.2%). Volume error for Evita XL was not related to TI (maximum error was -0.7mL/kg or -6%). CONCLUSIONS Calculation of VT as the integral of flow over the preset inspiratory time rather than the period between zero crossings of flow may result in underestimation of both inhaled and exhaled volumes.

Based on our observation that cerebral complications are associated with this treatment, we predict that the number of intraprocedural complications will rise as a result of this trend. METHODS Between January 2007 and December 2013, 1739 patients underwent 1764 detachable coil embolizations to treat intracranial aneurysms (637 ruptured and 1127 unruptured). We reviewed their records and images to evaluate the periprocedural complications and related morbidity and mortality. RESULTS 61 complications occurred during coil embolization and 33 periprocedural complications occurred within 1 week. These complications were observed in 8.6% of ruptured aneurysm embolization procedures (55/637) and in 3.5% of unruptured aneurysm embolization procedures (39/1127). There were 17 (0.96%) cerebral thromboembolisms, 34 (1.93%) intraprocedural aneurysm ruptures, 8 (0.45%) coil migrations, 13 (0.74%) postprocedural aneurysmal ruptures, and 22 (1.24%) neurologic deficits or transient neurologic deficits related to embolization. 63 complications had no neurologic consequences, 3 were associated with transient neurologic morbidity, 15 resulted in persistent neurologic morbidity on discharge, and 12 resulted in death. The procedure-related neurologic morbidity and mortality rates for all 1764 procedures were 0.85% in ruptured aneurysms and 0.68% in unruptured aneurysms. CONCLUSIONS The periprocedural complication rate was higher in ruptured aneurysms than in unruptured aneurysms. The main causes of morbidity and mortality were thromboembolisms, intraprocedural aneurysm perforations, and postprocedural aneurysmal ruptures. While some periprocedural complications are inevitable, we can minimize the occurrence of such complications by advancing our skill and experience, thereby improving patient prognosis.","Zheng, Yongtao; Liu, Yingjun; Leng, Bing; Xu, Feng; Tian, Yanlong",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,96,9

Overzealous fluid administration and subsequent fluid accumulation and overload are associated with poorer outcomes. Fluids are drugs, and their use should be tailored to meet the patient's individualized needs; fluids should never be given as routine maintenance unless indicated. Before prescribing any fluids, the physician should consider the patient's characteristics and the nature of the illness, and assess the risks and benefits of fluid therapy. Decisions regarding fluid therapy present a daily challenge in many hospital departments: emergency rooms, regular wards, operating rooms, and intensive care units. Traditional fluid prescription is full of paradigms and unnecessary routines as well as malpractice in the form of choosing the wrong solutions for maintenance or not meeting daily requirements. Prescribing maintenance fluids for patients on oral intake will lead to fluid creep and fluid overload. Fluid overload, defined as a 10% increase in cumulative fluid balance from baseline weight, is an independent predictor for morbidity and mortality, and thus hospital cost. In the last decade, increasing evidence has emerged supporting a restrictive fluid approach. In this manuscript, we aim to provide a pragmatic description of novel concepts related to the use of IV fluids in critically ill patients, with emphasis on the different indications and common clinical scenarios. We also discuss active deresuscitation, or the timely cessation of fluid administration, with the intention of achieving a zero cumulative fluid balance.","Perez Nieto, Orlando R; Wong, Adrian; Lopez Fermin, Jorge; Zamarron Lopez, Eder I; Meade Aguilar, Jose A; Deloya Tomas, Ernesto; Carrion Moya, Jorge D; Castillo Gutierrez, Gabriela; G Olvera Ramos, Maria; García Montes, Xiomara; Alberto Guerrero Gutiérrez, Manuel; George Aguilar, Fernando; Salvador Sánchez Díaz, Jesús; Soriano Orozco, Raúl; Ríos Argaiz, Eduardo; Hernandez-Gilsoul, Thierry; Secchi Del Rio, Roberto; Ñamendys-Silva, Silvio Antonio; L N G Malbrain, Manu",Anaesthesiology intensive therapy,96,19

Routine diagnostic investigations failed to identify a specific cause. Virus isolation from fresh necropsy tissues yielded a calicivirus with sequence homology to a vesivirus within the group colloquially known as the vesivirus 2117 strains that were originally identified as contaminants in CHO cell bioreactors. In situ hybridization and reverse transcription-PCR assays of tissues from the four deceased dogs confirmed the presence of canine vesivirus (CaVV) nucleic acids that localized to endothelial cells of arterial and capillary blood vessels. CaVV nucleic acid corresponded to areas of necrosis and hemorrhage primarily in the intestinal tract, but also in the brain of one dog with nonsuppurative meningoencephalitis. This is the first report of an atypical disease association with a putative hypervirulent vesivirus strain in dogs, as all other known strains of CaVV appear to cause nonclinical infections or relatively mild disease. After identification of the CU-296 vesivirus strain from this outbreak, four additional CaVV strains were amplified from unrelated fecal specimens and archived stocks provided by other laboratories. Broader questions include the origins, reservoir(s), and potential for reemergence and spread of these related CaVVs.","Renshaw, Randall W; Griffing, Jennifer; Weisman, Jaime; Crofton, Lisa M; Laverack, Melissa A; Poston, Robert P; Duhamel, Gerald E; Dubovi, Edward J",Journal of clinical microbiology,96,19

The etiology of acute bronchitis and asthma exacerbations is mostly viral and the therapy is symptomatic. Management decisions in community acquired pneumonia regarding site of care, extent of assessment, and level of treatment are based primarily on disease severity (outpatient, inpatient, ICU admission). Antibiotics are the main choice of treatment for patients with pneumonia, acute exacerbations (AE) of COPD (including increased sputum purulence and worsening shortness of breath) and AE of non-CF bronchiectasis. Inhaled antibiotics may represent a more optimal approach for the treatment and prevention of AE of non-CF bronchiectasis.

The management of each phase is unique and specific. The pulmonary phase of COVID-19 is characterized by an organizing pneumonia with profound immune dysregulation, activation of clotting, and a severe microvascular injury culminating in severe hypoxemia. The core treatment strategy to manage the pulmonary phase includes the combination of methylprednisolone, ascorbic acid, thiamine, and heparin (MATH+ protocol). The rationale for the MATH+ protocol is reviewed in this paper. AREAS COVERED We provide an overview on the pathophysiological changes occurring in patients with COVID-19 respiratory failure and a treatment strategy to reverse these changes thereby preventing progressive lung injury and death. EXPERT OPINION While there is no single 'Silver Bullet' to cure COVID-19, we believe that the severely disturbed pathological processes leading to respiratory failure in patients with COVID-19 organizing pneumonia will respond to the combination of Methylprednisone, Ascorbic acid, Thiamine, and full anticoagulation with Heparin (MATH+ protocol).We believe that it is no longer ethically acceptable to limit management to 'supportive care' alone, in the face of effective, safe, and inexpensive medications that can effectively treat this disease and thereby reduce the risk of complications and death.","Marik, Paul E; Kory, Pierre; Varon, Joseph; Iglesias, Jose; Meduri, G Umberto",Expert review of anti-infective therapy,96,19

An extended series of cardiac compressions offers the theoretical advantage of improving coronary perfusion pressures and hence, we aimed to explore the impact of compression cycles of two different durations. MATERIALS AND METHODS Newborn swine (n = 32, age 12-36 h, weight 2.0-2.7 kg) were progressively asphyxiated until asystole occurred. Animals were randomized to receive compressions:ventilations 3:1 (n=16) or 9:3 (n=16). Return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) was defined as a heart rate ≥ 100 beats min⁻¹. RESULTS All animals except one in the 9:3 group achieved ROSC. One animal in the 3:1 group suffered bradycardia at baseline, and was excluded, leaving us with 15 animals in each group surviving to completion of protocol. Time to ROSC (median and interquartile range) was 150 s (115-180) vs. 148 s (116-195) for 3:1 and 9:3, respectively (P = 0.74). There were no differences in diastolic blood pressure during compression cycles or in markers of hypoxia and inflammation. The temporal changes in mean arterial blood pressure, heart rate, arterial blood gas parameters, and systemic and regional oxygen saturation were comparable between groups. CONCLUSION Neonatal pigs with asphyxia-induced cardiac arrest did not respond to a compression:ventilation ratio of 9:3 better than to 3:1. Future research should address if alternative compression:ventilation ratios offer advantages over the current gold standard of 3:1.","Solevåg, Anne L; Dannevig, Ingrid; Wyckoff, Myra; Saugstad, Ola D; Nakstad, Britt",Resuscitation,96,31

Drawing on terror management theory, we develop and test a model that explains how COVID-19-triggered mortality salience influences employees' state anxiety and their responses at and outside work. We conducted an experience sampling method study using employees from an information technology firm in China when COVID-19 was surging there and two experiments using employees from a variety of industries in the United States when it became a new epicenter of the global outbreak. Results from 3 studies largely supported our theoretical hypotheses. Specifically, our research showed that mortality salience concerning COVID-19 was positively related to employees' state anxiety (general anxiety in Study 1 and Study 2 and death-specific anxiety in Study 3). Our studies also found that servant leadership is particularly crucial in guiding employees with state anxiety associated with COVID-19 mortality salience to be engaged in their jobs and to contribute more to the broader community.

However, many studies show that it is poorly evaluated and treated during the triage phase and that in many cases algometric scales aren't used for its evaluation. Faced with this, the Piacenza PER (Italy) implemented the Pain in Pediatric Emergency Room (PIPER) recommendations for the assessment and management of pain from the 1st July 2017. The aim of this study was to detect the possible differences in the trend of the outcomes for the detection and treatment of pain in July-October 2016, 2017, 2018. METHODS A retrospective observational study was chosen. 811 discharge letters of extremity traumatized children aged 0-9 years were analyzed, of which 309 referred to the 2016 quarter, 243 to the 2017 quarter and 259 to the 2018 quarter. RESULTS In 2016, the pain of 12 patients was assessed out of a total of 309, in 2017 of 227 out of 243 and in 2018 of 245 out of 259. The Chi Square test about assessed and not assessed pain, gave statistically significant value (p = 1.36E-98), comparing 2016vs2017 and gave not significant value comparing 2017vs2018 (p = 0.58). 4 patients were treated during the triage phase in 2016, 68 in 2017 and 70 in 2018.

Their management is expensive, a cost that can be reduced with proper preventive measures. Patients having surgery under general anaesthesia are at risk of developing PI, yet no specific tool has been developed to assess the risk in these patients. This review aimed to summarize the published data on perioperative risk factors associated with the development of PI in adults having surgery under general anaesthesia. METHODS All studies reporting on risk factors associated with the development of PI were included. Data were extracted from all articles and meta-analysis was performed when three or more studies reported on a specific variable. RESULTS The analysis identified five factors significantly associated with the development of PIs: cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, diabetes mellitus, low haemoglobin level and longer duration of surgery. Factors not associated included serum albumin concentration, use of vasopressors during surgery, use of corticosteroids, sex and age. CONCLUSION Cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, diabetes mellitus, anaemia and duration of surgery should be taken into consideration when trying to identify surgical patients at high risk of developing PIs.

Three hundred and forty-four individuals (≥18 years and 67% women) answered a self-reported online survey that included questions related to the physical exercise practice (e.g., supervised and remote) during social distancing and questions about perceptions of depressive symptoms (Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale-Self Rated [MADRS-S] scores) and metabolic equivalent task minutes per week (METs min•wk-1) of moderate- and vigorous-intensity PA, and total PA scores (International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form) before and during social distancing. The RSE group (n=45) showed higher METs of vigorous-intensity PA than the SGE (n=146) and NE (n=109) groups. The RSE and FFE (n=44) groups showed higher METs of the total PA scores than the SGE and NE groups. The NE group showed higher MADRS-S scores than the other groups. Lower MADRS-S scores depend on the exercise practice and higher METs of vigorous-intensity PA depend on the supervised exercise practice. Thus, telehealth interventions can be implemented during the pandemic to enhance vigorous PA.","Moreira-Neto, Acácio; Martins, Bruce; Miliatto, Angelo; Nucci, Mariana Penteado; Silva-Batista, Carla",Psychiatry research,96,1

One of the difficulties encountered in the virtual curriculum is the teaching of clinical competencies that would traditionally require students to undergo in-person simulations and patient encounters. We implemented a novel informed consent activity module with standardized patients to improve self-efficacy in communication within our core surgery clerkship. STUDY DESIGN All medical students who participated in the virtual surgery clerkship were recruited to participate in a retrospective survey study regarding the novel informed consent module. These questions evaluated their perceived competence in four domains relating to informed consent: identifying the key elements, describing common challenges, applying the New Mexico Clinical Communication Scale (NMCCS, and documenting. RESULTS 34 out of the 90 students participated in the study (38% of the cohort). Respondents to the survey reported that their self-efficacy in communication skills related to informed consent improved as a result of their participation in the activity in each of the four domains surveyed (p<0.01), with the majority of students identifying as satisfactory or above in each domain post-module. Students generally viewed the virtual informed consent activity positively, but noted that it was not the same as an in-person clinical experience. CONCLUSION A virtual module of communication skills training using standardized patients and faculty improved student belief in their self-efficacy in obtaining informed consent. This communication module can be useful in a virtual or mixed curricular structure for both current and future medical students.","Pang, Joyce H; Finlay, Esme; Fortner, Sally; Pickett, Bradley; Wang, Ming-Li",Journal of the American College of Surgeons,96,1

Consequently, people who are more prone to viral infections like influenza A or B, H1N1, SARS CoV (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus), and SARS CoV2 may develop susceptibility to immune responses in their lungs because our previous reports delineated the ability of QIAPI 1®, a melanin precursor, to dissociate water molecules with simultaneous therapeutic efficacy against central nervous system (CNS) diseases, retinopathy, and As-induced renal toxicity. Given the commonalities of lung pathology of SARS CoV and As-induced toxicity, the aim of this study is to decipher the efficacy of QIAPI 1® against pentavalent As-induced lung toxicity by examining the pulmonary pathology. Hematoxylin & Eosin (H&E) staining was used for ascertaining the lung pathology in Wistar rat models. Animals were divided into 3 groups: control group, group treated with pentavalent As, and a group treated with pentavalent As and QIAPI 1®. There were no significant changes in lung histopathology in the control group as indicated by intact morphology. As-treated group revealed damage to the histoarchitecture with pulmonary edema, interstitial fibrosis, diffuse alveolar damage, Bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP)-lesions, formation of hyaline membrane, multinucleated giant pneumocytes, atypical pneumocytes, inflammatory cell infiltration, and interstitial edema. The group treated with As and QIAPI 1® significantly associated with mitigated histological signs of lung inflammation induced by Arsenic. Therefore, QIAPI 1® can be recommended as antagonistic to As-induced lung toxicity. In conclusion, this model could be preferred as a hypothetical model to examine the efficacy of QIAPI 1® in SARS CoV2-induced pulmonary damage. Future studies are warranted to delineate the efficacy of QIAPI 1® against SARS CoV and SARS CoV2 lung pathology.","Herrera, Arturo Solís; Beeraka, Narasimha M; Sinelnikov, Mikhail Y; Nikolenko, Vladimir N; Giller, Dimitry B; Solis, Luis Fernando Torres; Mikhaleva, Liudmila M; Somasundaram, Siva G; Kirkland, Cecil E; Aliev, Gjumrakch",Current pharmaceutical biotechnology,96,1

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the incidence, severity, duration, risk factors and prognosis of AKI in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. METHODS We conducted a retrospective single-center analysis of 192 hospitalized COVID-19 patients from March to May of 2020. AKI was diagnosed using the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcome (KDIGO) classification based on serum creatinine (SCr) criteria. Persistent and transient AKI were defined according to the Acute Disease Quality Initiative (ADQI) workgroup definitions. RESULTS In this cohort of COVID-19 patients, 55.2% developed AKI (n=106). The majority of AKI patients had persistent AKI (n=64, 60.4%).

Although some studies had been reported for the understanding of genetic bases for cotton yield-related traits, the detected quantitative trait loci (QTL) for the traits is still very limited. To uncover the whole-genome QTL controlling three yield-related traits in upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.), phenotypic traits were investigated under four planting environments and 9244 single-nucleotide polymorphism linkage disequilibrium block (SNPLDB) markers were developed in an association panel consisting of 315 accessions. RESULTS A total of 53, 70 and 68 significant SNPLDB loci associated with boll number (BN), boll weight (BW) and lint percentage (LP), were respectively detected through a restricted two-stage multi-locus multi-allele genome-wide association study (RTM-GWAS) procedure in multiple environments. The haplotype/allele effects of the significant SNPLDB loci were estimated and the QTL-allele matrices were organized for offering the abbreviated genetic composition of the population. Among the significant SNPLDB loci, six of them were simultaneously identified in two or more single planting environments and were thought of as the stable SNPLDB loci. Additionally, a total of 115 genes were annotated in the nearby regions of the six stable SNPLDB loci, and 16 common potential candidate genes controlling target traits of them were predicted by two RNA-seq data. One of 16 genes (GH_D06G2161) was mainly expressed in the early ovule-development stages, and the stable SNPLDB locus (LDB_19_62926589) was mapped in its promoter region. CONCLUSION This study identified the QTL alleles and candidate genes that could provide important insights into the genetic basis of yield-related traits in upland cotton and might facilitate breeding cotton varieties with high yield.","Su, Junji; Wang, Caixiang; Ma, Qi; Zhang, Ai; Shi, Chunhui; Liu, Juanjuan; Zhang, Xianliang; Yang, Delong; Ma, Xiongfeng",BMC plant biology,96,31

We investigated whether TREM-1 is also expressed in non-infectious inflammation following traumatic lung contusion. METHODS In a study population of 45 adult patients with multiple trauma and lung contusion, we obtained bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) (blind suctioning of 20 ml NaCl (0.9%) via jet catheter) and collected blood samples at two time points (16 hours and 40 hours) after trauma. Post hoc patients were assigned to one of four groups radiologically classified according to the severity of lung contusion based on the initial chest tomography. Concentration of soluble TREM-1 (sTREM-1) and bacterial growth were determined in the BAL. sTREM-1, IL-6, IL-10, lipopolysaccharide binding protein, procalcitonin, C-reactive protein and leukocyte count were assessed in blood samples. Pulmonary function was evaluated by the paO2/FiO2 ratio. RESULTS Three patients were excluded due to positive bacterial growth in the initial BAL. In 42 patients the severity of lung contusion correlated with the levels of sTREM-1 16 hours and 40 hours after trauma. sTREM-1 levels were significantly (P < 0.01) elevated in patients with severe contusion (2,184 pg/ml (620 to 4,000 pg/ml)) in comparison with patients with mild (339 pg/ml (135 to 731 pg/ml)) or no (217 pg/ml (97 to 701 pg/ml)) contusion 40 hours following trauma. At both time points the paO2/FiO2 ratio correlated negatively with sTREM-1 levels (Spearman correlation coefficient = -0.446, P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS sTREM-1 levels are elevated in the BAL of patients following pulmonary contusion. Furthermore, the levels of sTREM-1 in the BAL correlate well with both the severity of radiological pulmonary tissue damage and functional impairment of gas exchange (paO2/FiO2 ratio).","Bingold, Tobias M; Pullmann, Barbara; Sartorius, Sven; Geiger, Emanuel V; Marzi, Ingo; Zacharowski, Kai; Wissing, Heimo; Scheller, Bertram",Critical care,96,2

A cohort study including all patients with advanced high-grade ovarian cancer. Survival analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank tests. Odds ratios and hazard ratios were calculated using multilevel, mixed-effects logistic regression and Cox regression, adjusting for repeated measures within individual patients. Two-hundred thirty-eight patients were included and underwent up to 10 lines of chemotherapy. The median PFS was 15.6 and OS was 55.6 months. Response rates dropped with each additional line and by line 5, most patients (61%) became refractory and only 16% had any type of response (complete 4% or partial 12%). By line 2, whether a patient had partial (PR), stable (SD) or progressive (PD) disease did not have an effect on the OS. From line 2, whether a patient had PR, SD or PD did not have an effect on chemotherapy free interval (CFI). Number of previous lines and time from previous line were the only variables that significantly correlated with both outcome of patients and response to the next line. In conclusion, time interval from the previous line of chemotherapy is the major clinical factor that predicts beneficial effect of another line of treatment in patients with ovarian cancer.","Kessous, Roy; Wissing, Michel D; Laskov, Ido; Abitbol, Jeremie; Bitharas, Joanna; Agnihotram, Venkata R; Yasmeen, Amber; Salvador, Shannon; Lau, Susie; Gotlieb, Walter H",International journal of cancer,96,1

The presence of HD identified a group of patients with higher mortality (35.4% vs. 18.2%, p < 0.001) but HD was not independently related to prognosis; renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, diuretics and beta-blockers did not worsen prognosis. Statins were independently associated with decreased mortality (0.551 [0.329-0.921], p = 0.023). Cardiovascular events during hospitalization identified a group of patients with poor outcome (mortality 31.8% vs. 19.3% without cardiovascular events, p = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS The presence of HD is related to higher mortality. Cardiovascular medications taken before admission are not harmful, statins being protective. The development of cardiovascular events during the course of the disease is related to poor outcome.","Cabezón Villalba, Gonzalo; Amat-Santos, Ignacio J; Dueñas, Carlos; Lopez Otero, Diego; Catala, Pablo; Aparisi, Alvaro; López-Pais, Javier; Cacho Antonio, Carla Eugenia; Candela, Jordi; Antúnez Muiños, Pablo; Gil, Jose Francisco; Gonzalez Ferrero, Teba; Marcos, Marta; Perez-Poza, Marta; Rojas, Gino; Otero Garcia, Oscar; Veras, Carlos; Jiménez Ramos, Victor; Uribarri, Aitor; Revilla, Ana; Garcia-Granja, Pablo Elpidio; Gómez, Itziar; González-Juanatey, José Ramón; San Roman, J Alberto",Cardiology journal,96,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS The local institutional review board approved this HIPAA-compliant study. Veterans were screened for contraindications and gave written informed consent before the study. In a semiblinded retrospective protocol, veterans in three Gulf War illness groups-syndrome 1 (impaired cognition), syndrome 2 (confusion-ataxia), and syndrome 3 (central neuropathic pain)-and a control group received intravenous infusions of saline in an initial session and physostigmine in a second session, 48 hours later. Each infusion was followed by measurement of hippocampal regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) with pulsed ASL. A mixed-effects linear model adjusted for age was used to test for differences in rCBF after the cholinergic challenge across the four groups. RESULTS Physostigmine significantly decreased hippocampal rCBF in control subjects (P < .0005) and veterans with syndrome 1 (P < .05) but significantly increased hippocampal rCBF in veterans with syndrome 2 (P < .005) and veterans with syndrome 3 (P < .002). The abnormal increase in rCBF was found to have progressed to the left hippocampus of the veterans with syndrome 2 and to both hippocampi of the veterans with syndrome 3. CONCLUSION Chronic hippocampal perfusion dysfunction persists or worsens in veterans with certain Gulf War syndromes. ASL MR imaging examination of hippocampal rCBF in a cholinergic challenge experiment may be useful as a diagnostic test for this condition.","Li, Xiufeng; Spence, Jeffrey S; Buhner, David M; Hart, John; Cullum, C Munro; Biggs, Melanie M; Hester, Andrea L; Odegard, Timothy N; Carmack, Patrick S; Briggs, Richard W; Haley, Robert W",Radiology,96,11

It is proposed that the conflicting reports on the prevalence of PLP are a consequence of variations in the time period during which the studies were undertaken, countries in which the studies were conducted and recruitment processes implemented during collection of epidemiological data. In consideration of these factors, we aim to gather and critically appraise relevant literature to determine the prevalence estimate of and risk factors for PLP in people with amputations. METHODS We will use a customised search strategy containing relevant words and terms to search the following databases: MEDLINE/PubMed (via EBSCOhost), PsycINFO (via EBSCOhost), PsycArticles, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (via EBSCOhost), Africa-Wide Information (via EBSCOhost), Health Source: Nursing/Academic Edition (via EBSCOhost) SCOPUS, Web of Science and Academic Search Premier (via EBSCOhost). The risk of bias assessment will be conducted using a risk of bias assessment tool for prevalence studies, and data will be extracted using a piloted customised data extraction sheet. Data extracted from individual studies will be entered into Review Manager 5 and assessed for clinical and statistical heterogeneity. Studies will be pooled for meta-analysis using the random-effects model to determine a summary estimate of the prevalence of PLP across included studies. A statistically significant level will be set at p < 0.05. DISCUSSION As far as we know, a systematic review and meta-analysis on the prevalence of, and risk factors for PLP in people with amputations has not been conducted. Given the varying reports in the literature, it is necessary to determine an estimate of the prevalence of PLP to generate an informed conclusion on this subject. The results of this review will be published in an internationally accredited journal and used to inform researchers, clinicians, policy-makers and the public about the burden of, and risk factors for PLP. This will be done with a further aim to improve the quality of pain management in society.

METHODS We analyzed service utilization data from the National Eating Disorder Information Centre (NEDIC). We compared the number of contacts and symptom frequency between the pandemic period and previous years. RESULTS NEDIC was contacted 609 times during March 1-April 30, 2020 (72.1% individuals affected by disordered eating, 20.4% caregivers). The number of total contacts significantly increased from 2018 to 2019 and 2018 to 2020 (X2(3) = 50.34, p < .001). Among affected individuals (80.4% women), the number of contacts during the pandemic period was significantly higher (n = 439; X2(2) = 92.74, p < .001) compared to 2018 (n = 197) and 2019 (n = 312). There were higher rates of eating disorder symptoms, anxiety, and depression in 2020 compared to previous years. Thematic analysis of instant chats from the pandemic year revealed four emerging themes: 1) lack of access to treatment, 2) worsening of symptoms, 3) feeling out of control, and 4) need for support. CONCLUSION These findings point toward the impact of COVID-19 in individuals affected by disordered eating and hold implications for service delivery during times of crises.","Richardson, Candice; Patton, Megan; Phillips, Suzanne; Paslakis, Georgios",General hospital psychiatry,96,2

Indeed, based on its design, APRV has technological features that serve the goals of safety and comfort. Animal studies suggest that APRV leads to alveolar stability and recruitment which result in less lung injury. These features are sought in patients at risk for lung injury or with ARDS. APRV allows unrestricted spontaneous ventilation, which is welcome in the era of less sedation and increased patient mobility (the effects in terms of lung injury remain to be explored). However, we must highlight that the performance of APRV is dependent on the operator-selected settings and the ventilator's performance. The clinician must select the appropriate settings in order to make effective the imputed benefits. This is a challenge when the ventilator's performance is not uniform, and the outcomes depend on high precision settings (very short expiratory time), where small variations can lead to undesired outcomes (de-recruitment or large tidal volumes leading to lung injury). Finally, we do not have evidence that APRV (as originally described) improves relevant clinical outcomes of patients with ARDS. For APRV to become the primary mode of ventilation for ARDS, it will require development of sound protocols and technological enhancements to ensure its performance and safety. For now, APRV does have a greater potential for adversely affecting patient outcome than improving it; unless definitive data are forthcoming demonstrating outcome benefits from the use of APRV in ARDS, there is no reason to consider this approach to ventilatory support.","Mireles-Cabodevila, Eduardo; Kacmarek, Robert M",Respiratory care,96,8

Cytokines, and especially IL-6, were found to be elevated in depressed patients with normal renal function. The objective of this pilot study was to examine the relationship between depression and cytokines (IL-6, TNF-alpha, and IL-10) in patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). METHODS We studied 44 stable patients with ESKD for 71 +/- 66 months (32 males; 64 +/- 13 years; 27 on hemodialysis and 17 on peritoneal dialysis). The control group included 20 healthy age- and gender-matched individuals (12 males; 60 +/- 12 years). Depression was assessed by the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (ZS). Nephelometry for high-sensitivity CRP and ELISA kits for IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-alpha were used. RESULTS Compared to controls, patients with ESKD had higher ZS scores (56.8 +/- 16.8 vs. 44 +/- 12.7, p < 0.01), WBC (7,987 +/- 2,347 vs. 6,413 +/- 870/mm(3), p < 0.01), ESR (36.3 +/- 15.8 vs. 9.4 +/- 3.3 mm, p < 0.001), TNF-alpha (52 +/- 18.4 vs. 10.7 +/- 2.8 pg/ml, p < 0.001) and IL-6 (6.3 +/- 4 vs. 1.8 +/- 0.4 pg/ml, p < 0.001). No differences in high-sensitivity CRP and IL-10 were noted between the ESKD and control groups. Serum IL-6 levels were the only parameter positively correlated with the values of the ZS score in ESKD patients (r = 0.34, p < 0.02). CONCLUSIONS IL-6 may play a role in the pathogenesis of depression in patients with ESKD.","Sonikian, Makrouhi; Metaxaki, Polyxeni; Papavasileiou, Dimitrios; Boufidou, Fotini; Nikolaou, Chrysoula; Vlassopoulos, Dimosthenis; Vlahakos, Demetrios V",American journal of nephrology,96,1

One way to examine how the environment influences signals is by comparing changes in signal effectiveness in different habitats. Examinations of signal effectiveness between different habitats has helped to explain signal divergence/convergence between populations and species using acoustic and colour signals. Although previous research has provided evidence for local adaptations and signal divergence in many species of lizards, comparative studies in movement-based signals are rare due to technical difficulties in quantifying movements in nature and ethical restrictions in translocating animals between habitats. We demonstrate herein that these issues can be addressed using 3D animations, and compared the relative performance of the displays of four Australian lizard species in the habitats of each species under varying environmental conditions. Our simulations show that habitats differentially affect signal performance, and an interaction between display and habitat structure. Interestingly, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that the signal adapted to the noisier environment does not show an advantage in signal effectiveness, but the noisy habitat was detrimental to the performance of all displays. Our study is one of the first studies for movement-based signals that directly compares signal performance in multiple habitats, and our approach has laid the foundation for future investigations in motion ecology that have been intractable to conventional research methods.","Bian, Xue; Pinilla, Angela; Chandler, Tom; Peters, Richard",Scientific reports,96,19

Current protocols for FAPs identification and isolation use flow cytometry/fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and studies evaluating their function in vivo to date have been undertaken exclusively in mice. The larger inherent size of the rat allows for a more comprehensive analysis of FAPs in skeletal muscle injury models, especially in severely atrophic muscle or when investigators require substantial tissue mass to conduct multiple downstream assays. The rat additionally provides a larger selection of muscle functional assays that do not require animal sedation or sacrifice, thus minimizing morbidity and animal use by enabling serial assessments. The flow cytometry/FACS protocols optimized for mice are species specific, notably restricted by the characteristics of commercially available antibodies. They have not been optimized for separating FAPs from rat or highly fibrotic muscle. A flow cytometry/FACS protocol for the identification and isolation of FAPs and MPs from both healthy and denervated rat skeletal muscle was developed, relying on the differential expression of surface markers CD31, CD45, Sca-1, and VCAM-1. As rat-specific, flow cytometry-validated primary antibodies are severely limited, in-house conjugation of the antibody targeting Sca-1 was performed. Using this protocol, successful Sca-1 conjugation was confirmed, and flow cytometric identification of FAPs and MPs was validated by cell culture and immunostaining of FACS-isolated FAPs and MPs. Finally, we report a novel FAPs time-course in a prolonged (14 week) rat denervation model. This method provides the investigators the ability to study FAPs in a novel animal model.","Te, Lucas Jaryd Iringan; Doherty, Christina; Correa, Judy; Batt, Jane",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,96,9

METHODS Literature analysis was focused on different varieties of SSPE: perinatal forms, short-incubation forms similar to acute measles inclusion body encephalitis (MIBE), rapidly evolving forms, forms occurring in the immunosuppressed, adult forms, and family forms. In addition, several studies on the parameters of innate immunity and interferon responses of patients were analyzed. RESULTS Two main data were highlighted: a relationship between the so-called fulminant forms and the prescription of corticosteroids was established. In familial SSPE, two groups were individualized according to the duration of the latency period, prompting an analysis of patient exomes. CONCLUSION Treatment with corticosteroids should be banned. Knowledge of the genes involved and epigenetics should be useful for understanding the pathophysiology of SSPE and other late-onset neurological infections with RNA viruses.","Lebon, P; Gelot, A; Zhang, S-Y; Casanova, J-L; Hauw, J-J",Revue neurologique,96,1

Over a median of 3.2 years of follow-up, among patients with stable CAD who had moderate or severe ischemia on stress testing, an initial invasive strategy, as compared with an initial conservative strategy, did not reduce the rates of the primary or key secondary composite outcomes. The primary outcome was the composite of death from cardiovascular causes, myocardial infarction (MI), or hospitalization for unstable angina, heart failure, or resuscitated cardiac arrest. The key secondary outcomes were the composite of death from cardiovascular causes or MI and angina-related quality of life. Patients in the invasive-strategy group had more procedural myocardial MIs, and they had fewer spontaneous infarctions during follow-up. The incidence of death from any cause was low and similar in the two groups. However, the ISCHEMIA trial was challenging to implement, event rates were low and enrollment fell behind initial milestones. Furthermore, power of the study was compromised, composite end-point definition as well as definitions of crucial individual components were changed amid study progression. There was a ""heterobaric"" combined end-point with procedural MIs favoring the conservative arm and spontaneous MIs favoring the invasive arm. Finally, the duration of reported follow-up showed signals that findings may shift in favor of invasive treatment and results were sensitive to definition and type of MIs. Therefore, we believe that it is premature to change clinical practice in view of the results of ISCHEMIA trial. As stable CAD patients is a vastly heterogenous patient group, it may be prudent to apply common clinical judgement and individual decision-making according to current guidelines before changing our management strategies.","Tziakas, Dimitrios; Chalikias, George; Triantis, George; Dagre, Anna",Hellenic journal of cardiology : HJC = Hellenike kardiologike epitheorese,96,12

To elucidate the underlying aerosol dynamics, the deposition fractions (DFs) of aerosols in healthy and asthmatic human airways of generations 13-15 are predicted. The Navier-stokes equations governing the gaseous phase and the discrete phase model for particles' motion are solved using numerical methods. The main forces responsible for deposition are inertial impaction forces and complex secondary flow velocities. The curvatures and sinusoidal folds in the asthmatic geometry lead to the formation of complex secondary flows and hence higher DFs. The intensities of complex secondary flows are strongest at the generations affected by asthma. The DF in the healthy airways is 0%, and it ranges from 1.69% to 52.93% in the asthmatic ones. From this study, the effects of the pharmaceutical aerosol particle diameters in the treatment of asthma patients can be established, which is conducive to inhibiting the inflammation of asthma airways.

This study reviews the primary and secondary technical effectiveness, overall survival of patients, recurrence-free survival, tumour-free survival, rates of local recurrence, and postprocedural RFA complications. Technical effectiveness and rates of complication with respect to tumour location and size were evaluated. Our results were compared with similar studies from Europe and North America. METHODS A total of 63 patients (109 tumours) treated with RFA between February 2004 and December 2009 were reviewed. Average and median follow-up time was 19.4 and 16.5 months, respectively (range, 1-54 months). Data from patient charts, pathology, and Picture Archiving and Communication System was integrated into an Excel database. Statistical Analysis Software was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS Primary and secondary technical effectiveness of percutaneous and intraoperative RFA were 90.8% and 92.7%, respectively. Average (SE) tumour-free survival was 14.4 ± 1.4 months (range, 1-43 months), and average (SE) recurrence-free survival was 33.5 ± 2.3 months (range, 2-50 months).

Importantly, M. hyopneumoniae could migrate to the basolateral chamber through the paracellular route but not the transcellular pathway, and this was achieved by reversibly disrupting tight junctions (TJs) and increasing the permeability and damaging the integrity of the epithelial barrier. We examined the migration ability of M. hyopneumoniae using an Ali-PBECs model for the first time.

METHODS A systematic search was conducted using the MEDLINE, Scopus, Embase and Cochrane databases according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Studies published between 2005 and 2019 were included. The quality of the studies selected was assessed, and a protocol was registered and published in advance (PROSPERO: CRD42019131800). The primary outcome measure was BCR. Secondary outcome measures included cancer-specific survival, metastasis-free survival and overall mortality during the follow-up period. RESULTS Our systematic search yielded 3116 unique results. Ten studies were selected for meta-analysis. The sample sizes of PSM cohorts varied from 200 to 956, while the median follow-up ranged from 1.5 to 13 years. Most studies used BCR as a surrogate marker for disease progression; only two studies reported other oncological outcomes. Meta-analysis was performed in selected groups (PGG, GS and GGG). PGG 4 or 5 at the PSM was found to be predictive of BCR (hazard ratio [HR] 1.66, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.37-2.02; P < 0.01).

Such research raises ethical concerns because of the risk that accidental release from a laboratory could lead to extensive or even global spread of a virulent pathogen. Biomedical research ethics has focused largely on human subjects research, while biosafety concerns about accidental infections, seen largely as a problem of occupational health, have been ignored. GOF/PPP research is an example of a small but important class of research where biosafety risks threaten public health, well beyond the small number of persons conducting the research.We argue that bioethical principles that ordinarily apply only to human subjects research should also apply to research that threatens public health, even if, as in GOF/PPP studies, the research involves no human subjects. Specifically we highlight the Nuremberg Code's requirements of 'fruitful results for the good of society, unprocurable by other methods', and proportionality of risk and humanitarian benefit, as broad ethical principles that recur in later documents on research ethics and should also apply to certain types of research not involving human subjects. We address several potential objections to this view, and conclude with recommendations for bringing these ethical considerations into policy development.","Evans, Nicholas Greig; Lipsitch, Marc; Levinson, Meira",Journal of medical ethics,96,5

In a previous study, each of three 5'-end-proximal cis-acting stem-loop domains in the BCoV genome, I/II, III, and IV, yielded near-wild-type (wt) MHV phenotypes when used by reverse genetics to replace its counterpart in the MHV genome. Replacement with the BCoV 32-nucleotide (nt) inter-stem-loop fourth domain between stem-loops III and IV, however, required blind cell passaging for virus recovery. Here, we describe suppressor mutations within the transplanted BCoV 32-nt domain that along with appearance of potential base pairings identify an RNA-RNA interaction between this domain and a 32-nt region ∼200 nt downstream within the nonstructural protein 1 (Nsp1)-coding region. Mfold and phylogenetic covariation patterns among similarly grouped betacoronaviruses support this interaction, as does cotransplantation of the BCoV 5' UTR and its downstream base-pairing domain. Interestingly, cotransplantation of the BCoV 5' UTR and BCoV Nsp1 coding region directly yielded an MHV wt-like phenotype, which demonstrates a cognate interaction between these two BCoV regions, which in the MHV genome act in a fully interspecies-compliant manner. Surprisingly, the 30-nt inter-stem-loop domain in the MHV genome can be deleted and viral progeny, although debilitated, are still produced. These results together identify a previously undescribed long-range RNA-RNA interaction between the 5' UTR and Nsp1 coding region in MHV-like and BCoV-like betacoronaviruses that is cis acting for viral fitness but is not absolutely required for viral replication in cell culture.","Guan, Bo-Jhih; Su, Yu-Pin; Wu, Hung-Yi; Brian, David A",Journal of virology,96,20

These measures were implemented to reduce virus spread and to ensure the continuity of nation-wide medical care, in particular with a view to having sufficient intensive-care capacities in case of a large caseload of patients infected with COVID-19. With regard to surgical specialties, this implied a temporary hold on elective cases for an indefinite period of time. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of these measures on the caseload of a level-three plastic surgery unit. METHODS This study retrospectively assessed the caseload at the Division of Plastic, Aesthetic and Reconstructive Surgery at Medical University Graz during the so-called lockdown from 16 March 2020 to 27 April 2020 (6 weeks) as well as two weeks before. The data was compared with the corresponding time period of the year 2019. Surgical spectrum, procedural urgency, medical indication of surgical procedures as well as complication rates were compared. RESULTS The suspension of elective cases led to a significant reduction in caseload of 57.5 % (2019: 353, 2020: 150 cases). There was a significant increase in emergency and acute case procedures performed during the lockdown compared with the previous year (2019: 41, 2020: 58 cases, p < 0.001). Furthermore, the number of self-inflicted injuries and suicide attempts increased significantly (2019: 0, 2020: 16 cases, p < 0.001). With regard to private and work-related injuries, there was no significant difference. Also, there was no difference in complication rates (2019: 6.8, 2020: 10 %, p = 0.219). CONCLUSION A significant amount of surgical procedures in plastic surgery at a supraregional academic health centre consists of emergency, acute and urgent medically necessary cases. During the lockdown, surgical procedures were performed without a significant increase in complication rates. Despite challenges during the pandemic, high-quality patient care was provided throughout. To process less urgent yet important cases accumulated during the lockdown in a reasonable amount of time and maintaining the same level of high-quality care, additional capacities regarding operating rooms, hospital beds and outpatient care are needed. These results point out the importance of plastic surgery for medical care, in particular during times of crisis.","Popp, Daniel; Smolle, Christian; Nischwitz, Sebastian P; Sawetz, Isabelle; Schaunig, Caroline; Winter, Raimund; Spendel, Stephan; Kamolz, Lars-Peter","Handchirurgie, Mikrochirurgie, plastische Chirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Handchirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Mikrochirurgie der Peripheren Nerven und Gefasse : Organ der V...",96,23

In patients with histologically proven LSCC, tumor specimens were stained using immunohistochemistry (for PD-1, PD-L1, CD4, CD8, and FOXP3) on paraffin-embedded tissues. Patients with (N+) and without (N-) nodal metastasis were stratified and matched to each other according to prognostically relevant clinicopathological parameters. 58 patients (29 N+ and 29 N-) were included. PD-L1 expression was positive (>1%) in 56.1% (n = 33) of all LSCC cases, but its expression did not differ significantly between metastasis groups (65.5% in N+ versus 48.3% in N-; p = 0.144). Nodal disseminated LSCC showed a tendency for higher PD-L1 expression. None of the analyzed markers showed significant correlation with the risk for nodal disease, or revealed significant prognostic value. Due to their significant expression, PD-L1 and PD-1 are potential targets for checkpoint inhibitor therapy in LSCC. Their expression should be analyzed in advanced and metastasized LSCC cases.","Klein, M; Wermker, K; Hallermann, C; Pannier, F; Hölzle, F; Modabber, A",Journal of cranio-maxillo-facial surgery : official publication of the European Association for Cranio-Maxillo-Facial Surgery,96,16

It manifests in some cases as increasing inflammation to even the onset of a cytokine storm and irreversible progression of acute respiratory syndrome, which is associated with the risk of death in patients. Thus, proactive anti-inflammatory therapy remains an open serious question in patients with COVID-19 and pneumonia, who still have signs of inflammation on days 7-9 of the disease: elevated C-reactive protein (CRP)>60 mg/dL and at least two of the four clinical signs: fever >37.5°C; persistent cough; dyspnea (RR >20 brpm) and/or reduced oxygen blood saturation <94% when breathing atmospheric air. We designed the randomized trial: COLchicine versus Ruxolitinib and Secukinumab in Open-label Prospective Randomized Trial in Patients with COVID-19 (COLORIT). We present here data comparing patients who received colchicine with those who did not receive specific anti-inflammatory therapy. Results of the comparison of colchicine, ruxolitinib, and secukinumab will be presented later.Objective Compare efficacy and safety of colchicine compared to the management of patients with COVID-19 without specific anti-inflammatory therapy.Material and Methods Initially, 20 people were expected to be randomized in the control group. However, enrollment to the control group was discontinued subsequently after the inclusion of 5 patients due to the risk of severe deterioration in the absence of anti-inflammatory treatment. Therefore, 17 patients, who had not received anti-inflammatory therapy when treated in the MSU Medical Research and Educational Center before the study, were also included in the control group. The effects were assessed on day 12 after the inclusion or at discharge if it occurred earlier than on day 12. The primary endpoint was the changes in the SHOCS-COVID score, which includes the assessment of the patient's clinical condition, CT score of the lung tissue damage, the severity of systemic inflammation (CRP changes), and the risk of thrombotic complications (D-dimer) [1].Results The median SHOCS score decreased from 8 to 2 (p = 0.017), i.e., from moderate to mild degree, in the colchicine group. The change in the SHOCS-COVID score was minimal and statistically insignificant in the control group. In patients with COVID-19 treated with colchicine, the CRP levels decreased rapidly and normalized (from 99.4 to 4.2 mg/dL, p<0.001). In the control group, the CRP levels decreased moderately and statistically insignificantly and achieved 22.8 mg/dL by the end of the follow-up period, which was still more than four times higher than normal. The most informative criterion for inflammation lymphocyte-to-C-reactive protein ratio (LCR) increased in the colchicine group by 393 versus 54 in the control group (p = 0.003). After treatment, it was 60.8 in the control group, which was less than 100 considered safe in terms of systemic inflammation progression. The difference from 427 in the colchicine group was highly significant (p = 0.003).The marked and rapid decrease in the inflammation factors was accompanied in the colchicine group by the reduced need for oxygen support from 14 (66.7%) to 2 (9.5%). In the control group, the number of patients without anti-inflammatory therapy requiring oxygen support remained unchanged at 50%. There was a trend to shorter hospital stays in the group of specific anti-inflammatory therapy up to 13 days compared to 17.5 days in the control group (p = 0.079). Moreover, two patients died in the control group, and there were no fatal cases in the colchicine group. In the colchicine group, one patient had deep vein thrombosis with D-dimer elevated to 5.99 µg/mL, which resolved before discharge.Conclusions Colchicine 1 mg for 1-3 days followed by 0.5 mg/day for 14 days is effective as a proactive anti-inflammatory therapy in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and viral pneumonia. The management of such patients without proactive anti-inflammatory therapy is likely to be unreasonable and may worsen the course of COVID-19. However, the findings should be treated with caution, given the small size of the trial.","Mareev, V Yu; Orlova, Ya A; Plisyk, A G; Pavlikova, E P; Akopyan, Z A; Matskeplishvili, S T; Malakhov, P S; Krasnova, T N; Seredenina, E M; Potapenko, A V; Agapov, M A; Asratyan, D A; Dyachuk, L I; Samokhodskaya, L M; Mershina, Е А; Sinitsyn, V E; Pakhomov, P V; Zhdanova, E A; Mareev, Yu V; Begrambekova, Yu L; Kamalov, А А",Kardiologiia,96,16

A sequence of disease phases in patients with severe COVID-19 results in a cytokine storm, which amplifies the subclinical inflammation that already exists in patients with obesity. Pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemotactic factors increase insulin resistance in obesity. Therefore, a greater systemic inflammatory response is establishe, along with an increased risk of thrombotic phenomena and hyperglycemic conditions. These changes further impair pulmonary, cardiac, hepatic, and renal functions, in addition to hindering glycemic control in people with diabetes and pre-diabetes.

This study aimed to determine the performance of the Wavelet-Based Outbreak detection method (WOD (in detecting outbreaks and to compare its performance with the Poisson regression-based model and Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) using data of simulated pertussis outbreaks in Iran. METHOD The data on suspected cases of pertussis from 25th February 2012 to 23rd March 2018 in Iran was used. The performance of the WOD ( Daubechies 10 and Haar wavelets), Poisson regression-based method, and EWMA Compared in terms of timeliness and detection of outbreak days using the simulation of different outbreaks. In the current study, two simulations were used, one based on retrospectively collected data (literature-based) on pertussis cases and another one on a synthetic data set created by the researchers. The sensitivity, specificity, false alarm, and false-negative rate, positive and negative likelihood ratios, under ROC areas and median timeliness were used to assess the performance of the methods. RESULTS In a literature-based outbreak simulation, the highest and lowest sensitivity, false negative in the detection of injected outbreaks were seen in Daubechies 10 (db10), with sensitivity 0.59 (0.56-0.62), and Haar wavelets with 0.57 (0.54-0.60). In the researcher simulated data, the EWMA (K=0.5) with sensitivity 0.92 (0.90-0.94) had the best performance. About timeliness, the WOD methods showed the best performance in the early warning of the outbreak in both simulation approaches. CONCLUSION Performance of the WOD in the early alarming outbreaks was appropriate. However, this method would be best used along with other methods of public health surveillance.

Materials and Methods: Patient needs assessments were performed from January 2019 to March 2020. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic accelerated implementation of the quality improvement project, and clinically appropriate patients were scheduled for video visits starting March 16, 2020. From September 8, 2020 to October 2, 2020, caregivers of transgender and gender diverse (TGD) minors or TGD young adults pursuing gender-affirming medications completed 9-item surveys evaluating communication quality and privacy, access to care, and quality of services for video and clinic visits. Answers were rated via Likert scales (1 = strongly agree, 5 = strongly disagree; 1 = less travel time, 4 = more travel time). Results: Needs assessment (n = 69) showed that 63.8% felt that video visits would improve follow-up. Survey participants (n = 91) reported statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) in several areas. Compared with clinic visits, video visits were more convenient, 1.21 ± 0.435 versus 2.36 ± 1.207, took less time from other activities, 4.55 ± 0.522 versus 2.93 ± 1.281, required less travel time, 1.03 ± 0.180 versus 2.63 ± 0.901, and were more acceptable, 1.35 ± 0.545 versus 1.65 ± 0.736. Participants were more likely to choose video visits in the future, 1.32 ± 0.555 versus 1.57 ± 0.732. There were no statistically significant differences in communication quality, privacy, or overall satisfaction.

OBJECTIVE The study aimed to shed light on relations between caregiver mental reaction to the pandemic and caregiver distress related to neuropsychiatric symptoms, memory impairment progression, and functional impairment of people with neurocognitive disorder during the period of confinement in Greece. METHODS The study included caregivers of patients with mild (N = 13) and major (N = 54) neurocognitive disorder. The caregiver-based telephone interview was based on items of the neuropsychiatric inventory questionnaire, the AD8 Dementia Screening Instrument, and the Bristol Activities of Daily Living Scale. Regarding the mental impact of the COVID-19 crisis on caregivers, four single questions referring to their worries in the last seven days were posed, in addition to the scales Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item (GAD-7) and the 22-item Impact of Event Scale-revised (IES-R). A stepwise linear regression model was employed for studying the relationship between caregiver distress and demographic and clinical data and caregiver mental reaction to COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. RESULTS Caregiver distress severity during the confinement period was influenced not only by memory deficits (p = 0.009) and neuropsychiatric symptoms (p < 0.001) of patients, but also by caregiver hyperarousal (p = 0.003) and avoidance symptoms (p = 0.033) and worries directly linked to the COVID-19 crisis (p = 0.022). CONCLUSION These observations provide further evidence for the urgent need for support of caregivers of patients with neurocognitive disorder during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Alexopoulos, Panagiotis; Soldatos, Rigas; Kontogianni, Evagellia; Frouda, Maria; Loanna Aligianni, Souzana; Skondra, Maria; Passa, Maria; Konstantopoulou, Georgia; Stamouli, Evangelia; Katirtzoglou, Evgenia; Politis, Anastasios; Economou, Polychronis; Alexaki, Maria; Siarkos, Kostas; Politis, Antonios",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,96,32

Mainstream treatment option is surgery, but is less suitable for small or deep lesions, which makes ablation a promising alternative. Case presentation Two young female with typical manifestations of reninoma, including hypertension, hypokalemia, high renin, high aldosterone and normal ARR, were treated successfully with real-time contrast-enhanced ultrasound guided radiofrequency ablation, and contrast-enhanced ultrasound was also performed before and after treatment for diagnosis and postoperative assessment. Afterward, their blood pressure and laboratory tests became normal and remained steady during the follow-up of 32 and 6 months, respectively. Conclusion Contrast-enhanced ultrasound guided radiofrequency ablations is a promising alternative for reninoma treatment with comparable safety and efficacy with surgery, and has advantages especially in small or deep lesions.","Zhang, Rui; Xu, Ming; Xie, Xiao-Yan",Frontiers in oncology,96,1

In response, many European countries have implemented unprecedented non-pharmaceutical interventions such as closure of schools and national lockdowns. We study the impact of major interventions across 11 European countries for the period from the start of COVID-19 until the 4th of May 2020 when lockdowns started to be lifted. Our model calculates backwards from observed deaths to estimate transmission that occurred several weeks prior, allowing for the time lag between infection and death. We use partial pooling of information between countries with both individual and shared effects on the reproduction number. Pooling allows more information to be used, helps overcome data idiosyncrasies, and enables more timely estimates. Our model relies on fixed estimates of some epidemiological parameters such as the infection fatality rate, does not include importation or subnational variation and assumes that changes in the reproduction number are an immediate response to interventions rather than gradual changes in behavior. Amidst the ongoing pandemic, we rely on death data that is incomplete, with systematic biases in reporting, and subject to future consolidation. We estimate that, for all the countries we consider, current interventions have been sufficient to drive the reproduction number [Formula: see text] below 1 (probability [Formula: see text]< 1.0 is 99.9%) and achieve epidemic control. We estimate that, across all 11 countries, between 12 and 15 million individuals have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 up to 4th May, representing between 3.2% and 4.0% of the population. Our results show that major non-pharmaceutical interventions and lockdown in particular have had a large effect on reducing transmission.

MATERIALS AND METHODS A systematic literature search was conducted using the PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases for articles published till August 10, 2020. We included studies providing information regarding diagnostic test accuracy of FDA-EUA POCTs for SARS-CoV-2 detection. The methodologic quality was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 tool. The review protocol is registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (protocol number CRD42020202248). RESULTS We included 26 studies describing a total of 3242 samples. The summary sensitivity and specificity were 0.94 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.88-0.97] and 1.00 (95% CI: 0.99-1.00), respectively. The area under the summary receiver operating characteristic curve was 1.00 (95% CI: 0.99-1.00). A pooled analysis based on the index test revealed a summary sensitivity and specificity of Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 [0.99 (95% CI: 0.97-1.00) and 0.99 (95% CI: 0.94-1.00, respectively)] and ID NOW COVID-19 [0.78 (95% CI: 0.74-0.82) and 1.00 (95% CI: 0.98-1.00), respectively]. CONCLUSIONS FDA-EUA POCTs, especially molecular assays, have high sensitivity, specificity, and overall diagnostic accuracy for detecting SARS-CoV-2. If approved, FDA-EUA POCTs can provide a rapid and practical way to identify infected individuals early on and help to limit the strain on the healthcare system. However, more high-quality clinical data are required to support our results.","Yoon, S H; Yang, S; Cho, H; Eun, S; Koo, C M; Kim, M K",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,96,6

Evaluating unexplained increases in deaths due to all causes or attributed to nonspecific outcomes, such as pneumonia and influenza, can provide a more complete picture of the burden of COVID-19. Objective To estimate the burden of all deaths related to COVID-19 in the United States from March to May 2020. Design, Setting, and Population This observational study evaluated the numbers of US deaths from any cause and deaths from pneumonia, influenza, and/or COVID-19 from March 1 through May 30, 2020, using public data of the entire US population from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). These numbers were compared with those from the same period of previous years. All data analyzed were accessed on June 12, 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures Increases in weekly deaths due to any cause or deaths due to pneumonia/influenza/COVID-19 above a baseline, which was adjusted for time of year, influenza activity, and reporting delays. These estimates were compared with reported deaths attributed to COVID-19 and with testing data. Results There were approximately 781 000 total deaths in the United States from March 1 to May 30, 2020, representing 122 300 (95% prediction interval, 116 800-127 000) more deaths than would typically be expected at that time of year. There were 95 235 reported deaths officially attributed to COVID-19 from March 1 to May 30, 2020. The number of excess all-cause deaths was 28% higher than the official tally of COVID-19-reported deaths during that period. In several states, these deaths occurred before increases in the availability of COVID-19 diagnostic tests and were not counted in official COVID-19 death records. There was substantial variability between states in the difference between official COVID-19 deaths and the estimated burden of excess deaths. Conclusions and Relevance Excess deaths provide an estimate of the full COVID-19 burden and indicate that official tallies likely undercount deaths due to the virus. The mortality burden and the completeness of the tallies vary markedly between states.","Weinberger, Daniel M; Chen, Jenny; Cohen, Ted; Crawford, Forrest W; Mostashari, Farzad; Olson, Don; Pitzer, Virginia E; Reich, Nicholas G; Russi, Marcus; Simonsen, Lone; Watkins, Anne; Viboud, Cecile",JAMA internal medicine,96,1

High-throughput screening assays opening access to untargeted steps of the viral replication cycle will provide powerful leverage to identify innovative antiviral molecules. We report here the development of an innovative protein complementation assay, termed αCentauri, to measure viral translocation between subcellular compartments. As a proof of concept, the Centauri fragment was either tethered to the nuclear pore complex or sequestered in the nucleus, while the complementary α fragment (<16 amino acids) was attached to the integrase proteins of infectious HIV-1. The translocation of viral ribonucleoproteins from the cytoplasm to the nuclear envelope or to the nucleoplasm efficiently reconstituted superfolder green fluorescent protein or NanoLuc αCentauri reporters. These fluorescence- or bioluminescence-based assays offer a robust readout of specific steps of viral infection in a multiwell format that is compatible for high-throughput screening and is validated by a short hairpin RNA-based prototype screen.","Fernandez, Juliette; Hassen-Khodja, Cédric; Georget, Virginie; Rose, Thierry; Jacob, Yves; Janin, Yves L; Nisole, Sébastien; Vidalain, Pierre-Olivier; Arhel, Nathalie J",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,96,11

Radium was also originally thought to have beneficial health properties, leading to confusion amongst the public about the safety of radium in household products and food items. When the adverse health effects associated with radium were discovered and became well known, radium products became unpopular and were prohibited in some countries. In the United States, after the hazards associated with radium became known, radium was first regulated by individual states in the late 1920s and early 1930s. Later, the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) was given a role in the regulation of discrete sources of radium with the passage of the Energy Policy Act of 2005. After passage of the Act, the NRC began to systematically identify sites around the country where radium was used and reached out to site owners to determine whether existing radium contamination could pose a risk to public health and safety and the environment. The NRC devised a graded approach in response to its new regulatory responsibilities to address potential public health and safety issues at legacy radium sites. By September 2019, the NRC had dispositioned all the sites that were identified as having potential contamination from historical radium within its regulatory purview in non-Agreement States. The staff worked with site owners and federal, state and local officials, as needed, to properly disposition the sites to ensure that each site either meets the applicable criteria for unrestricted use or has controls in place to limit access during remediation so that no site poses an unacceptable risk to public health and safety and the environment.","Grossman, C; Barr, C; King, D; McKenney, C; Koenick, S; Chang, R",Journal of radiological protection : official journal of the Society for Radiological Protection,96,20

Objective data would allow for a greater understanding of sleep-related changes at the population level. About 163,524 active Fitbit users from 6 major US cities contributed data, representing areas particularly hard-hit by the pandemic (Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, and Miami). Sleep variables extracted include nightly and weekly mean sleep duration and bedtime, and variability (standard deviation) of sleep duration and bedtime. Deviation from similar timeframes in 2018 and 2019 were examined, as were changes in these sleep metrics during the pandemic, relationships to changes in resting heart rate, and changes during re-opening in May and June. Overall, compared to 2019, mean sleep duration in 2020 was higher among nearly all groups, mean sleep phase shifted later for nearly all groups, and mean sleep duration and bedtime variability decreased for nearly all groups (owing to decreased weekday-weekend differences). Over the course of January to April 2020, mean sleep duration increased, mean bedtime shifted later, and mean sleep duration variability decreased. Changes in observed resting heart rate correlated positively with changes in sleep and negatively with activity levels. In later months (May and June), many of these changes started to drift back to historical norms.","Rezaei, Naghmeh; Grandner, Michael A",Sleep health,96,31

To gain insight into the seasonality and epidemiologic characteristics of HMPV infection, this study determined the frequency of HMPV infections in hospitalized infants during a 7-year period. METHODS By use of real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, nasopharyngeal aspirates from 1612 infants less than 2 years of age who were hospitalized for acute respiratory tract illness were tested for the presence of HMPV. Weekly HMPV testing data were analyzed to assess the timing of HMPV activity. Season variability was estimated by comparing the onset, duration, peak, and end of outbreaks from October 2000 through October 2007. RESULTS Overall, 109 (6.8%) of 1612 cases of acute respiratory illness were associated with HMPV infection. Seasonal HMPV activity varied substantially from year to year, both in prevalence rates of HMPV cases and in seasonal timing of outbreaks. HMPV activity was characterized by a biennial rhythm, with spring seasons occurring every second year, and these accounted for a substantial proportion, up to 30%, of hospitalized cases of acute respiratory tract illness. CONCLUSIONS HMPV activity varies substantially from year to year, both in the frequency and timing of illness and shows a biennial pattern of alternating winter and spring activity.","Aberle, Stephan W; Aberle, Judith H; Sandhofer, Michael J; Pracher, Elisabeth; Popow-Kraupp, Therese",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,96,26

Understanding the origin and mechanisms underlying NM-induced developmental toxicity will be a cornerstone in the protection of sensitive populations and the design of safe and sustainable nanotechnology applications. MAIN BODY Direct toxicity originating from NMs crossing the placental barrier is frequently assumed to be the key pathway in developmental toxicity. However, placental transfer of particles is often highly limited, and evidence is growing that NMs can also indirectly interfere with fetal development. Here, we outline current knowledge on potential indirect mechanisms in developmental toxicity of NMs. SHORT CONCLUSION Until now, research on developmental toxicity has mainly focused on the biodistribution and placental translocation of NMs to the fetus to delineate underlying processes. Systematic research addressing NM impact on maternal and placental tissues as potential contributors to mechanistic pathways in developmental toxicity is only slowly gathering momentum. So far, maternal and placental oxidative stress and inflammation, activation of placental toll-like receptors (TLRs), impairment of placental growth and secretion of placental hormones, and vascular factors have been suggested to mediate indirect developmental toxicity of NMs. Therefore, NM effects on maternal and placental tissue function ought to be comprehensively evaluated in addition to placental transfer in the design of future studies of developmental toxicity and risk assessment of NM exposure during pregnancy.","Dugershaw, Battuja Batbajar; Aengenheister, Leonie; Hansen, Signe Schmidt Kjølner; Hougaard, Karin Sørig; Buerki-Thurnherr, Tina",Particle and fibre toxicology,96,0

Lack of treatment effect could be due to Treatment Resistance (TR). Consensus on a definition for TR Anxiety Disorders (TR-AD) is highly needed as currently many different operationalizations are in use. Therefore, generalizability in current TR-AD research is suboptimal, hampering improvement of clinical care. The objective of this review is to evaluate the currently used definitions of TR-AD by performing a systematic review of available literature. Out of a total of n = 13 042, 62 studies that operationalized TR-AD were included. The current review confirms a lack of consensus on TR-AD criteria. In 62.9% of the definitions, TR was deemed present after the first treatment failure. Most studies (93.0%) required pharmacological treatment failures, whereas few (29.0%) required psychological treatment failures. However, criteria for what constitutes ""treatment failure"" were not provided in the majority of studies (58.1%). Definitions for minimal treatment duration ranged from at least 4 weeks to at least 6 months. Almost half of the TR-AD definitions (46.8%) required elevated anxiety severity levels in TR-AD. After synthesis of the results, the consensus definition considers TR-AD present after both at least one first-line pharmacological and one psychological treatment failure, provided for an adequate duration (at least 8 weeks) with anxiety severity remaining above a specified threshold. This definition could contribute to improving course prediction and identifying more targeted treatment options for the highly burdened subgroup of TR-AD patients.","Bokma, Wicher A; Wetzer, Guido A A M; Gehrels, Jurriaan B; Penninx, Brenda W J H; Batelaan, Neeltje M; van Balkom, Anton L J M",Depression and anxiety,96,1

Recent epidemiological data show that Black communities are being disproportionately impacted by COVID-19, resulting in higher morbidity and mortality rates compared to other racial and ethnic groups. For Black women in particular, a long-standing history of systemic racism and marginalization has resulted in increased vulnerability and susceptibility to certain adverse health outcomes. Recent data show that COVID-19 knowledge rates among Black participants are low, and that Black women who become infected with COVID-19 have higher risks of complications and mortality compared to their non-Black counterparts. Given this data, there is a need to explore where and how Black women are obtaining information that pertains to COVID-19, along with the impacts that COVID-19 may be having on their daily lives. DESIGN We conducted interviews with 15 Black women who are clients at a community-based family service center to assess their understanding of COVID-19, determine how they were obtaining COVID-19 information, and evaluate the various impacts that COVID-19 was having on their lives. An initial codebook was developed based on the recorded interviews which included deductive and inductive codes. A thematic analysis of the data was then conducted using MaxQDA (Verbi Software), focusing on Black women's experiences related to COVID-19. RESULTS The majority of participants were using a combination of social media platforms and news sources to obtain information about COVID-19. Most participants (79%) expressed confusion, misunderstanding, and mistrust of the information that they were receiving about COVID-19. CONCLUSION In addressing COVID-19-related health disparities within Black communities, it is imperative for trusted entities and organizations within Black communities to provide accurate and tailored information regarding this novel virus.","Chandler, Rasheeta; Guillaume, Dominique; Parker, Andrea G; Mack, Amber; Hamilton, Jill; Dorsey, Jemea; Hernandez, Natalie D",Ethnicity & health,96,1

Current guidelines recommended diagnostic work-up for endocarditis among patients with S. gallolyticus bacteremia. However, S. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus, was found to be associated with neonatal sepsis and liver diseases and is less commonly associated with endocarditis compared with S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus. Our study aimed to identify the risk factors for S. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus endocarditis to help select the patients for echocardiography. Methods In this retrospective cohort study, medical records from all adult patients with S. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus isolated from blood cultures at Phramongkutklao Hospital from 2009 to 2015 were reviewed. Patients who had mixed bacteremia or missing records were excluded from the study. Results During the study period, S. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus was isolated among 106 individuals. Mean age was 66.9±15.6 years. Most patients (61.3%) were male, with cirrhosis as the most common underlying diseases (46.2%), followed by malignancy and chronic kidney disease. Most common manifestations included primary bacteremia (44.3%), followed by spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (23.6%). Infective endocarditis was found among 9 patients. No patients with cirrhosis or single blood specimen of bacteremia had endocarditis (RR 0; p-value 0.003, and RR 1.35; p-value 0.079). The common complications associated with endocarditis were acute respiratory failure (RR 4.32; p-value 0.05), whereas acute kidney injury was a protective factor (RR 0; p-value 0.01). Among 76 patients who had records of 2-year follow-up, no new diagnosis of endocarditis or malignancy was observed. Conclusion Among patients with S. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus bacteremia, echocardiography might not be needed among patients with cirrhosis and without sustained bacteremia.","Nasomsong, Worapong; Vasikasin, Vasin; Traipattanakul, Jantima; Changpradub, Dhitiwat",Infection and drug resistance,96,1

Effective rate (CR+PR) of the RFA group was significantly higher than that of the chemotherapy group (P<0.05). By contrast, the progressive rate (P) of RFA combined chemotherapy group was significantly lower than that of the RFA and chemotherapy groups (P<0.05). In conclusion, RFA combined chemotherapy has obvious effect on middle and late period NSCLC, and is safe and feasible.","Yu, Shuo; Wu, Zhen Zhou; Si, Hong Tao; Yang, Sai; Liu, Guang Mao; Zhao, Xiao Dong",Oncology letters,96,24

This study examined the effects of new lifestyle behaviors on cardiovascular risk factors during the pandemic. An online, self-administered, anonymous questionnaire was filled by 1964 persons from different regions of Turkey, England, France, and Germany. As the main findings in the survey, participants had less daily stress levels (P = .019), ate more healthy foods (P < .001), and increased their exercise duration (P < .001). There were more physically active people (P < .001), and inactive participants before the pandemic become active during the pandemic (P < .001). The age group with longest exercise duration was those aged 60 to 69 years who are a high-risk group in terms of cardiovascular diseases. The positive lifestyle changes people made to be healthier during the pandemic may have constituted an important reason for the decrease in STEMI cases admitted to the emergency department in this period.","Bilgin Dogan, Nazile; Ozel, Erdem",Asia-Pacific journal of public health,96,1

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis, with trial sequential analysis to understand the benefits, risks and impact of new trials reporting in 2016 on the magnitude/certainty of the estimates for clinical effectiveness and safety of mechanical thrombectomy. Method Random effects' models were conducted of randomised clinical trials comparing mechanical thrombectomy (stent retriever or aspiration devices) with/without adjuvant intravenous thrombolysis with intravenous thrombolysis and other forms of best medical/supportive care in the treatment of acute ischaemic stroke. Study inclusion and risk of bias were assessed independently by two reviewers. Functional independence (modified Rankin Scale 0-2) and mortality at 90 days, including symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage rate were extracted. Trial sequential analysis established the strength of the evidence derived from the meta-analyses. Findings Eight trials of mechanical thrombectomy with a total sample size of 1841 (916 patients treated with mechanical thrombectomy and 925 treated without mechanical thrombectomy) fulfilled review inclusion criteria. The three most recent trials more precisely defined the effectiveness of mechanical thrombectomy (modified Rankin Scale 0 to 2; OR = 2.07, 95% CI = 1.70 to 2.51 based on data from eight trials versus OR = 2.39, 95% CI = 1.88 to 3.04 based on data from five trials). Meta-analyses showed no effect on mortality (OR = 0.81, 95% CI = 0.61 to 1.07) or symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage (OR = 1.22, 95% CI = 0.80 to 1.85) as found in analysis of first five trials. Trial sequential analysis indicated that the information size requirement was fulfilled to conclude the evidence for mechanical thrombectomy is robust. Discussion The impact of three recent trials on effectiveness and safety of mechanical thrombectomy was a more precise pooled effect size for functional independence. Trial sequential analysis demonstrated sufficient evidence for effectiveness and safety of mechanical thrombectomy. Conclusion No further trials of mechanical thrombectomy versus no mechanical thrombectomy are indicated to establish clinical effectiveness. Uncertainty remains as to whether mechanical thrombectomy reduces mortality or increases risk of symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage.","Flynn, Darren; Francis, Richard; Halvorsrud, Kristoffer; Gonzalo-Almorox, Eduardo; Craig, Dawn; Robalino, Shannon; McMeekin, Peter; Cora, Adela; Balami, Joyce; Ford, Gary A; White, Phil",European stroke journal,96,7

Recognising the risk factors for non-contact injury in this population will aid future injury prevention strategies. OBJECTIVE To identify the risk factors for non-contact injury in adolescent cricket pace bowlers. METHODS We systematically searched PubMed, Cochrane Library, PEDro, SPORTDiscus, Embase, and the South African Journal of Sports Medicine to identify all experimental and observational studies reporting risk factors for non-contact injuries in pace bowlers (aged 12-19 years). The search syntax included terms relevant to cricket bowling, injury, and known risk factors for injury. The Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale and a modified Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale were used to assess the risk of bias in the cohort and cross-sectional studies, respectively. RESULTS Sixteen studies (five cross-sectional studies, 11 cohort studies) comprising 687 participants (96% male, 75% playing cricket in Australia) met the selection criteria and were included for qualitative synthesis. Three cross-sectional studies were rated as high risk of bias and two as very high risk of bias. For the cohort studies, three were rated as low risk of bias, and eight as high risk of bias. Injury was associated with bowling biomechanics (excessive lateral trunk flexion and pelvis/hip kinematics), reduced trunk endurance, poor lumbo-pelvic-hip movement control, and early signs of lumbar bone stress. Conflicting results were found by studies examining the mixed technique, bowling workload and quadratus lumborum asymmetry. CONCLUSIONS The current systematic review identified a number bowling biomechanics and various neuromuscular deficiencies as risk factors for non-contact injury in adolescent pace bowlers. These factors may provide a useful target for future interventional research aiming to prevent injury in this population. Future studies should utilise prospective cohort designs, and ensure that participants are injury-free at baseline, confounding factors are well controlled and attrition rates are reported.

A promising approach to increase the effectiveness while reducing the individual's burden is the use of just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI) mechanisms. JITAIs are designed to improve the effectiveness of the intervention and reduce the burden of the person using the intervention by providing the right type of support at the right time. The right type and right time are determined by measuring the state of vulnerability and the state of receptivity. OBJECTIVE With this work, we systematically assess the use of JITAI mechanisms in popular apps for individuals with depression. METHODS We systematically searched for apps addressing depression in the Apple App Store, the Google Play Store, and in curated lists from the Anxiety and Depression Association of America, the United Kingdom National Health Service, and the American Psychological Association in August 2020. Relevant apps were ranked according to the number of reviews (Apple App Store) or downloads (Google Play Store). For each app, two authors separately reviewed all publications concerning the app found within scientific databases (PubMed, Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials, PsycINFO, Google Scholar, IEEExplore, Web of Science, ACM Portal, and Science Direct), publications cited on the app's website, information on the app's website, and the app itself. All types of measurements (e.g., open questions, closed questions, device analytics) found in the apps were recorded. These measurements found were reviewed to investigate whether they were used to tailor content or timing along the JITAI mechanisms, to indicate progress, or as part of a component (e.g., describing a stressful situation). RESULTS None of the 28 reviewed apps used JITAI mechanisms to tailor content to situations, states, or individuals. Three apps did not use any measurements, 20 apps exclusively used self-reports that are insufficient to leverage the full potential of JITAIs, and the five apps employing self-reports and passive measurements used them as progress or task indicators only. While 23 of the 68 reviewed publications investigated the effectiveness and 14 publications investigated the efficacy of the apps, not one publication mentioned or evaluated JITAI mechanisms. CONCLUSIONS Promising JITAI mechanisms have not yet been translated into mainstream depression apps. While the wide range of passive measurements available from smartphones were very rarely used, self-reported outcomes were used by 20 apps. However, in both cases, the measured outcomes were not used to tailor along a state of vulnerability or receptivity. Due to this lack of tailoring to individual, states, or situation, we argue that the apps cannot be considered as JITAIs. The lack of publications investigating whether JITAI mechanisms lead to an increase of the apps' effectiveness or efficacy highlights the need for further research, especially in real-world apps.

The ""Athens Marathon, The Authentic"" is a 42,195m (26.2mile) race with approximately 18,000 runners that increases annually. On the same day, additional races take place and a grand total of more than 50,000 runners fill the city center of Athens, Greece. Responding effectively to unexpected incidents requires comprehensive planning, clear decision-making structure, and effective collaboration. Nonetheless, there is limited empirical evidence to support interagency collaboration in mass gatherings. PURPOSE This study used the 2017 Athens Marathon and related races as the empirical setting to examine how interagency collaboration was perceived among the multiple public health and safety professionals involved in the marathon command center. METHODS Data comprised 10 semi-structured, in-depth interviews with key informants, direct observations of meetings and the event itself, and documentary analysis. Open coding and thematic analysis were used to analyze the data. RESULTS Findings indicated four key components of interagency collaboration in such an event: organizational culture, team synthesis, on-site spatial planning, and the usage of radio-amateurs. CONCLUSION This study outlined the factors that shaped interagency collaboration in the context of a mass event. Practical implications arising from this study may inform the ways organizers of marathons and other mass sporting events can engage in effective partnerships and joint working.","Bistaraki, Angeliki; Georgiadis, Konstantinos; Pyrros, Demetrios G",Prehospital and disaster medicine,96,13

The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency and association of SOD1 gene polymorphisms (rs2234694 and 50 bp Ins/Del) in BC patients in the Mexican population. MATERIALS AND METHODS The SOD1 polymorphisms were determined by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) in Mexican healthy subjects and BC patients. RESULTS The rs2234694 polymorphism was associated with BC susceptibility when BC patients and the control group were compared for the AC genotype (p<0.0001), the AC/CC genotype (dominant model: p<0.0001), and the C allele (p<0.0001). The 50 bp Ins/Del polymorphism was associated with BC susceptibility for the Del allele (p=0.048), although the association between the dominant model AC/CC (rs2234694) and BC patients was evident for menopause [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.65 (95% CI 1.05-2.7); p=0.048], Ki-67 (≥15%) (OR1.9, 95% CI 1.14- 3.16, p=0.016), and the presence of DM2 (OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.35- 4.31, p=0.003). A protective association for BC of the rs2234694 polymorphism was observed in patients younger than 50 years positive for estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR), carrying the AC genotypes (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.23-0.94, p= 0.033) and CC (OR 0.11, 95% CI 0.013-1.07, p=0.047). The association between the InsDel/DelDel (dominant model; 50 bp Ins/Del) genotype and BC with metastatic lymph nodes (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.1-2.25, p=0.019), hematologic toxicity (OR 1.5, 95%CI 1.1-2.23, p=0.015), gastric toxicity (OR 1.5, 95%CI 1.1-2.07, p=0.030), and Ki-67 (≥15%) (OR1.6, 95%CI 1.2-2.26, p=0.002) was evident, indicating that these factors may contribute significantly to BC risk. The C/Ins haplotype was also associated with BC susceptibility (OR3.47, 95% CI 1.62-7.74, p=0.001). CONCLUSIONS rs2234694 and 50 bp Ins/Del polymorphisms in the SOD1 gene were associated with BC susceptibility in a Mexican population. A protective association for BC of the rs2234694 polymorphism was observed in patients younger than 50 years positive for ER and PR, carrying the AC genotypes. The haplogenotypes AA/InsIns and AC/InsDel could contribute significantly to BC risk in gastric and hematologic toxicities, metastatic lymph nodes, and the presence of DM2 in the Mexican population analyzed.","Gallegos-Arreola, M P; Ramírez-Hernández, M A; Figuera, L E; Zúñiga-González, G M; Puebla-Pérez, A M",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,96,2

This can result in burnout, mental ill-health and suicide. Within a crossover pilot study comparing personalised, trauma-informed yoga to group-format exercise, qualitative interviews were conducted to understand the experience of junior doctors and whether such interventions were perceived to help manage these stressors. METHODS Twenty-one doctors, 76% female, were order-randomised to consecutive 8-week yoga and exercise programmes. Fifty-two interviews were recorded before and after each programme. RESULTS Many participants reported being time poor, sleep-affected, frequently stressed and occasionally in physical pain/distress. Major stressor themes were workplace incivility, death/human suffering and shift work with minimal support. Both interventions were acceptable for different reasons. Personalised yoga offered a therapeutic alliance, time to check-in and reduced anxiety/rumination. Group exercise provided energy and social connection. One participant found yoga beneficial following an acute workplace trauma: 'It was really eye opening how much I felt my body just needed to detox … I wouldn't have gone to a group fitness the next day … I just wanted to relax and breathe …We still had a big debrief which was great … (but) I almost felt like … I dealt with it physically and emotionally before going into it (P20).' CONCLUSION Junior doctors found both interventions useful for stress management adjunctive to other organisational programmes though for different and complementary reasons, possibly related to delivery mode. Personalised, trauma-informed yoga provided a confidential therapeutic alliance whereas group exercise offered social connection.","Taylor, Jennifer; Stratton, Elizabeth; McLean, Loyola; Richards, Bethan; Glozier, Nicholas",Postgraduate medical journal,96,30

However, for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), concerns have been raised regarding the oncologic safety (i.e., radical resection, lymph node retrieval, and survival) of MIDP, as compared to ODP. Therefore, a randomized controlled trial comparing MIDP and ODP in PDAC regarding oncological safety is warranted. We hypothesize that the microscopically radical resection (R0) rate is non-inferior for MIDP, as compared to ODP. METHODS/DESIGN DIPLOMA is an international randomized controlled, patient- and pathologist-blinded, non-inferiority trial performed in 38 pancreatic centers in Europe and the USA. A total of 258 patients with an indication for elective distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy because of proven or highly suspected PDAC of the pancreatic body or tail will be randomly allocated to MIDP (laparoscopic or robot-assisted) or ODP in a 1:1 ratio. The primary outcome is the microscopically radical resection margin (R0, distance tumor to pancreatic transection and posterior margin ≥ 1 mm), which is assessed using a standardized histopathology assessment protocol. The sample size is calculated with the following assumptions: 5% one-sided significance level (α), 80% power (1-β), expected R0 rate in the open group of 58%, expected R0 resection rate in the minimally invasive group of 67%, and a non-inferiority margin of 7%. Secondary outcomes include time to functional recovery, operative outcomes (e.g., blood loss, operative time, and conversion to open surgery), other histopathology findings (e.g., lymph node retrieval, perineural- and lymphovascular invasion), postoperative outcomes (e.g., clinically relevant complications, hospital stay, and administration of adjuvant treatment), time and site of disease recurrence, survival, quality of life, and costs. Follow-up will be performed at the outpatient clinic after 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36 months postoperatively. DISCUSSION The DIPLOMA trial is designed to investigate the non-inferiority of MIDP versus ODP regarding the microscopically radical resection rate of PDAC in an international setting.

FPG reduces the extent of lymphadenectomy and gastric resection without compromising the long-term prognosis. Proximal gastrectomy (PG) is an alternative to total gastrectomy (TG) for EGC in the upper-third of the stomach, in which the gastric reservoir, gastric acid secretion, and intrinsic factors are maintained. Distal gastrectomy (DG) with a small remnant stomach, namely subtotal gastrectomy (STG), is another option for upper EGC, where the function of the cardia and fundus is preserved. Pylorus-preserving gastrectomy (PPG) is a good alternative to DG for EGC in the middle-third of the stomach, where pyloric function is preserved. Following elucidation of the markedly low incidences of possible metastasis to lymph node stations where dissection is omitted, the oncological safety of these FPG procedures was clarified. Nutritional advantages of PG or STG over TG have been reported; however, the standardized reconstruction methods after PG are yet to be established, and it is important to devise methods to prevent postoperative gastroesophageal reflux and anastomotic complications regardless of the reconstruction method. Nutritional benefits of PPG compared with DG have also been clarified, in which reducing postoperative gastric stasis is important. For the further spread of these FPG procedures, several issues, such as precise evaluation of preserved function, confirmation of oncological safety, and standardization of the technique, should be addressed in future prospective randomized controlled trials.","Kosuga, Toshiyuki; Tsujiura, Masahiro; Nakashima, Susumu; Masuyama, Mamoru; Otsuji, Eigo",Annals of gastroenterological surgery,96,1

We sought to characterize the outcomes of patients who undergo elective and nonelective ventral hernia (VH) repair using a large population-based data set. MATERIALS AND METHODS The Nationwide Inpatient Sample was queried for primary International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes associated with VH repair (years 2008-2011). Outcomes were inhospital mortality and the occurrence of a preidentified complication. Multivariable analysis was performed to determine the risk factors for complications and mortality after both elective and nonelective VH repair. RESULTS We identified 74,151 VH repairs performed during the study interval. Of these procedures, 67.3% were elective and 21.6% were performed laparoscopically. Nonelective repair was associated with a significantly higher rate of morbidity (22.5% versus 18.8%, P < 0.01) and mortality (1.8% versus 0.52, P < 0.01) than elective repair. Elective repairs were more likely to occur in younger patients, Caucasians, and were more likely to be performed laparoscopically. Logistic modeling revealed that female gender, Caucasian race, elective case status, and laparoscopic approach were independently associated with a lower probability of complications and mortality. Minority status and Medicaid payer status were associated with increased probability of nonelective admission. CONCLUSIONS Patients undergoing elective VH repair in the United States tend to be younger, Caucasian, and more likely to have a laparoscopic repair. Nonelective VH is associated with a substantial increase in morbidity and mortality. We recommend that patients consider elective repair of VHs because of the increased morbidity and mortality associated with nonelective repair.","Simon, Kathleen L; Frelich, Matthew J; Gould, Jon C; Zhao, Heather S; Szabo, Aniko; Goldblatt, Matthew I",The Journal of surgical research,96,17

METHOD There was successful recruitment of an online sample of Jordanian people through the network of the researcher with popular Jordanian media. The participants completed a self-created online violence questionnaire. The violence questionnaire had numerous questions about the clinical attributes and COVID-19 prevention. RESULTS The incidence of violence was high during the outbreak 40% and the predictors were found to be unemployed and married. CONCLUSION Violence continues to be a significant social problem in our society today, yet, continues to be poorly understood.

Using social exchange as our theoretical foundation and three-wave lagged survey data collected from N = 300 employees within the United States, the current study found support for the contention that individuals with greater job insecurity pursue fewer idiosyncratic deals (I-Deals) with their employers. Fewer I-Deals in turn were associated with lower affective commitment, and higher turnover intentions, perceived psychological contract breach, and psychological contract violation. However, these indirect effects were conditional upon employee levels of grit (specifically, perseverance of effort), such that higher grit attenuated the negative relationship between job insecurity and the pursuit of I-Deals. Given that employees often have little control over the source of their experienced job insecurity (e.g., impending layoffs, a poor economy, announced merger or acquisition), these findings hold promise in potentially alleviating the well-documented negative outcomes of job insecurity through interventions designed to increase employee levels of grit and facilitate the creation of I-Deals.

METHODS A sample of primarily American women who gave birth around the height of COVID-19 (n = 1,611) and matched controls, i.e., women who gave birth before COVID-19 (n = 640), completed an anonymous Internet survey about recent childbirth, birth-related traumatic stress (peritraumatic distress inventory; PTSD-checklist), maternal bonding (maternal attachment inventory; mother-to-infant bonding scale) and breastfeeding status. Groups (n = 637 in each) were matched on demographics, prior mental health/trauma and childbirth factors to determine the unique contribution of COVID-19 to the psychological experience of childbirth. RESULTS Mothers in COVID-19-exposed communities endorsed more clinically acute stress response to childbirth than matched controls (Z = 2.65, p = .008, OR= 1.38). A path mediation model revealed that acute stress mediated the relationship between study group and postpartum outcomes. Specifically, higher acute stress response in birth was associated with more childbirth-related posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms (β = .42, p < .001) and less bonding with the infant (β = .26, p < .001), including breastfeeding problems (β = .10, p < .01). LIMITATIONS Use of a convenient internet sample introduces bias towards more educated women and reliance on retrospective self-report assessments may entail recall bias. CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 is a major stressor for delivering women. It can heighten traumatic childbirth experiences and interfere with successful postpartum adjustment. Clinical attention to traumatic stress in childbirth and problems with caring for the young during this pandemic is important.","Mayopoulos, Gus A; Ein-Dor, Tsachi; Dishy, Gabriella A; Nandru, Rasvitha; Chan, Sabrina J; Hanley, Lauren E; Kaimal, Anjali J; Dekel, Sharon",Journal of affective disorders,96,13

Among them, angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) and the Mas receptor have forced a reevaluation of the original cascade and led to the emergence of a new arm of the RAS: the ACE2/ANG-(1-7)/Mas axis. Accordingly, the new system is now seen as a balance between a provasoconstrictor, profibrotic, progrowth axis (ACE/ANG-II/AT(1) receptor) and a provasodilatory, antifibrotic, antigrowth arm (ACE2/ANG-(1-7)/Mas receptor). Already, this simplistic vision is evolving and new components are branching out upstream [ANG-(1-12) and (pro)renin receptor] and downstream (angiotensin-IV and other angiotensin peptides) of the classical cascade. In this review, we will summarize the role of the ACE2/ANG-(1-7)/Mas receptor, focusing on the central nervous system with respect to cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension, chronic heart failure, and stroke, as well as neurological diseases. In addition, we will discuss the new pharmacological (antagonists, agonists, activators) and genomic (knockout and transgenic animals) tools that are currently available.

Methods We estimated the instantaneous CFR of eight European countries using Bayesian inference in conjunction with stochastic transmission models, taking account of delays in reporting the number of newly confirmed cases and deaths. The exposure lag response associations between fatality rate and weather conditions to which patients were exposed at different timing were obtained using distributed lag nonlinear models coupled with mixed effect models. Results Our results showed that the Odds Ratio (OR) of death is negatively associated with the temperature, with two maxima (OR=1.29 (95% CI, 1.23, 1.35) at -0.1 degrees Centigrade, OR=1.12 (95% CI, 1.08, 1.16) at 0.1 degrees Centigrade) occurred at the time of virus exposure and after symptom onset. Two minima (OR=0.81 (95% CI: 0.71, 0.92) at 23.2 degrees Centigrade, OR=0.71 (95% CI, 0.63, 0.80) at 21.7 degrees Centigrade) also occurred at these two distinct periods correspondingly. Low humidity (below 50%) during the early stages and high humidity (around 89%) after symptom onset were related to the lower fatality. Conclusion Environmental conditions may affect not only the initial viral load when exposure to viruses but also individuals immunity response around symptom onset. Warmer temperatures and higher humidity after symptom onset were related to the lower fatality.","Liang, J.; Yuan, H.-Y.",,96,1

Enzymatic attachment of complex oligosaccharides to proteins (glycosylation) is highly responsive to numerous (patho)physiological conditions and ageing, which is perhaps best exemplified on IgG. The prospect of immune age reduction, by reverting induced glycosylation changes through metabolic intervention, opens many possibilities. Herein, we have investigated whether weight loss interventions affect inflammation- and ageing-related glycosylation alterations, in a longitudinal cohort of bariatric-surgery patients. To support potential findings, BMI-related glycosylation changes were monitored in a longitudinal TwinsUK cohort. Methods IgG and plasma N-glycans were chromatographically profiled in 37 obese patients, subjected to low-calorie diet and then to bariatric surgery, across multiple timepoints. Similarly, plasma glycome was analysed in 1,680 TwinsUK participants and longitudinally monitored during a 20-year follow-up. Findings Low-calorie diet induced marked increase in low branched and significant decrease in highly branched, more complex plasma N-glycans - the change opposite to the one typically observed in inflammatory conditions. Bariatric surgery resulted in extensive, gradual alterations in IgG glycome, that accompanied progressive weight loss during one year follow-up. We observed significant increase in digalactosylated and sialylated, and substantial decrease in agalactosylated and core fucosylated IgG glycans. In general, such IgG glycan profile is associated with a younger biological age and reflects enhanced anti-inflammatory IgG potential. The TwinsUK cohort replicated weight loss-associated agalactosylation decrease and digalactosylation increase, estimated through BMI decrease over a 20-year period. Interpretation Altogether, these findings highlight that weight loss substantially affects both plasma and IgG N-glycosylation, resulting in improved biological and immune age.","Greto, V.

Methods A retrospective analysis of the records of the Information System of the Epidemiological Surveillance of Influenza of the Health Ministry of Brazil was performed. It included the data of female patients aged 10 to 49 years hospitalized because of severe COVID-19 disease (RT-PCR+ for SARS-CoV-2), from February 17, 2020, to January 02, 2021. They were separated into 3 groups: pregnant, puerperal, and neither pregnant nor puerperal. General comparisons and then adjustments for confounding variables (propensity score matching [PSM]) were made, using demographic and clinical characteristics, disease progression (admission to the intensive care unit [ICU] and invasive or noninvasive ventilatory support), and outcome (cure or death). Deaths were analyzed in each group according to comorbidities, invasive or noninvasive ventilatory support, and admission to the ICU. Results As many as 40,640 reproductive age women hospitalized for COVID-19 were identified: 3,372 were pregnant, 794 were puerperal, and 36,474 were neither pregnant nor puerperal. Groups were significantly different in terms of demographic data and comorbidities. Pregnant and puerperal women were less likely to be symptomatic than the women who were neither one nor the other. Pregnant women, however, had a higher frequency of cough, anosmia, and ageusia. Puerperal women had a worse prognosis than pregnant women with respect to admission to the ICU, invasive ventilatory support, and death.

Here, we used high-resolution mass-spectrometry to characterize the proteomes of macrophages with genetically altered Nrf2 status. Our analysis revealed significant differences among the genotypes in cellular metabolism and redox homeostasis, which we validated with respirometry and metabolomics, as well as in anti-viral immune pathways and the cell cycle. Nrf2 status significantly affected the proteome following lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation, with alterations in redox, carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, and innate immunity observed. Of note, Nrf2 activation was found to promote mitochondrial fusion in inflammatory macrophages. The Keap1 inhibitor, 4-octyl itaconate (4-OI), a derivative of the mitochondrial immunometabolite itaconate, remodeled the inflammatory macrophage proteome, increasing redox and suppressing anti-viral immune effectors in a Nrf2-dependent manner. These data suggest that Nrf2 activation facilitates metabolic reprogramming and mitochondrial adaptation, and finetunes the innate immune response in macrophages.

The Covid-19 has promoted the large-scale application of online education and made the teaching of accounting produce new characteristics. The development of information technology puts forward higher requirements for the training of accounting talents, which requires accounting work to be changed from traditional financial accounting to management accounting decision-making [1]. Combined with the existing problems in the teaching of accounting in private colleges, we should find out the advantages and disadvantages of accounting specialty education under online education and integrate the link between online education and traditional education. From the aspects of the online educational resource management system, teachers' and students' information literacy, accounting professional virtual practice teaching platform, teacher-student relationship, and online teaching-learning evaluation mechanism, the advantages of offline education and online education are complementary. This paper puts forward a new idea of reform of accounting specialty teaching in private colleges under online education and creates a new accounting specialty teaching model. © 2021 IEEE.","Yinghui, Z.; Lin, C.","2021 International Conference on Internet, Education and Information Technology, IEIT 2021",96,23

Although it has now been over a year since the onset of outbreak, there are still significant knowledge gaps on the short and long term impacts of COVID-19 on people with aphasia (PWAs) and their primary caretakers. With reference to a reshaped rehabilitation service plan to advocate for people facing disabilities and some pilot findings from an ongoing survey investigation in Hong Kong about PWAs' perspectives on the pandemic, this article aims to highlight the social inactivity and communication challenges posed to PWAs and healthy adults during lockdown. Conclusions: The social isolation and mental implications among PWAs in Hong Kong subsequent to their limited opportunities to engage into social activities during the pandemic were evident. At the same time, one should not neglect the emotional and psychosocial impacts on PWAs' caretakers and other healthy adults. We encourage researchers from different parts of the world, especially developing and undeveloped countries, to explore and share current service delivery to PWAs and corresponding strategic plans to enhance clinical practices in this unprecedented difficult time.","Pak-Hin Kong, Anthony Kai-Yan Lau Dustin Nga-Ying Chai Vivian",Perspectives of the ASHA Special Interest Groups,96,16

Analysis of the index case reveals a sub-consensus level of sequencing reads (~25%) that support a 17-nucleotide deletion in ORF7a (ORF7a{Delta}17del). ORF7a{Delta}17del induces a frameshift mutation in ORF7a, which truncates the peptide and potentially leads to reduced suppression of host restriction factor BST-2/CD317/Tetherin. Despite this, the mutation has rapidly become represented at the consensus level in subsequent cases: approximately 72% of SARS-CoV-2 genomes in the Australian outbreak possess ORF7a{Delta}17del, and 99.7% (1534/1538) of Delta genomes on GISAID with ORF7a{Delta}17del originate from the current Australian outbreak (5 August 2021). The global abundance of this mutation might be underestimated given the difficulty of variant calling software correctly calling insertion/deletions (indels), the common inability of phylogenetics software to take indels into account, and the tendency of GISAID to not release submissions that contain a frameshift mutation (unless specifically requested). Overall, the rapid increase of persistent ORF7a{Delta}17del variants is concerning, and suggests either a chance founder effect with a neutral mutation yet to be purged, or that the ORF7a{Delta}17del mutation provides a direct selective advantage.","Foster, C.

While a digital revolution has allowed for open access to large datasets enabling real-time tracking of the epidemic, detailed, locally-specific clinical data has been less readily accessible to a broad range of academic faculty and their trainees. This perpetuates the separation of the primary missions of clinically-focused and primary research faculty resulting in lost opportunities for improved understanding of the local epidemic; expansion of the scope of scholarship; limitation of the diversity of the research pool; lack of creation of initiatives for growth and dissemination of research skills needed for the training of the next generation of clinicians and faculty. Methods: We constructed a research platform called the Department of Medicine COVID-19 Explorer and Repository (DOM-CovX), to house cleaned, highly granular, de-identified, continually-updated data from over 7,000 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 (1/2020-present) across the Yale New Haven Health System. This included a front-end user interface for simple data visualization of aggregate data and more detailed clinical datasets for researchers after a review board process. The goal is to promote access to local COVID-19 clinical data, thereby increasing efficiency, streamlining and democratizing the research enterprise at Yale. Expected Outcomes: 1) Accelerate generation of new knowledge and increase scholarly productivity with particular local relevance 2) Improve the institutional academic climate by: a. Broadening research scope b. Expanding research capability to more diverse group of stakeholders including clinical and research-based faculty and trainees c. Enhancing interdepartmental collaborations Conclusions: The DOM-CovX Data Explorer and Repository have great potential to increase academic productivity. By providing an accessible tool for simple data analysis and access to a consistently updated, standardized and large-scale dataset, it overcomes barriers for a wide variety of researchers. Beyond academic productivity, this innovative approach represents an opportunity to improve the institutional climate by fostering collaboration, diversity of scholarly pursuits and expanding medical education. It provides a novel approach that can be expanded to other diseases beyond COVID 19.","Arora, T.; Simonov, M.

During the first COVID-19 lockdown in France, all patients treated with IV TCZ or IV ABA were offered the option to switch to SC administration. Objectives: The primary aim was to assess the impact of changing the route of administration on the disease activity. The second aim was to assess whether the return to IV route at the patient's request was associated with disease activity variation, flares, anxiety, depression and low physical activity during the lockdown. Methods: We conducted a prospective monocentric observational study. Eligibility criteria: Adult ≥ 18 years old, RA treated with IV TCZ or IV ABA with a stable dose ≥3 months, change in administration route (from IV to SC) between March 16, 2020, and April 17, 2020. The following data were collected at baseline and 6 months later (M6): demographics, RA characteristics, treatment, history of previous SC treatment, disease activity (DAS28), self-administered questionnaires on flares, RA life repercussions, physical activity, anxiety and depression (FLARE, RAID, Ricci & Gagnon, HAD). The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with a DAS28 variation≥1.2 at M6. Analyses: Chi2-test for quantitative variables and Mann-Whitney test for qualitative variables. Factors associated with return to IV route identification was performed with univariate and multivariate analysis. Results: Among the 84 patients who were offered to switch their treatment route of administration, 13 refused to change their treatment. Among the 71 who switched (48 TCZ, 23 ABA), 58 had a M6 follow-up visit (13 lost of follow-up) and DAS28 was available for 49 patients at M6. Main baseline characteristics: female 81%, mean age 62.7, mean disease duration: 16.0, ACPA positive: 72.4%, mean DAS28: 2.01, previously treated with SC TCZ or ABA: 17%. At M6, the mean DAS28 variation was 0.18 ± 0.15. Ten (12.2%) patients had a DAS28 worsening≥1.2 (ABA: 5/17 [29.4%] and TCZ: 5/32 [15.6%], p= 0.152) and 19 patients (32.8%) had a DAS28 worsening≥0.6 (ABA: 11/17 [64.7%] and TCZ: 8/32 [25.0%], p= 0.007). At M6, 41 patients (77.4%) were back to IV route (26 TCZ, 15 ABA) at their request. The proportion of patients with a DAS28 worsening≥1.2 and≥0.6 in the groups return to IV versus SC maintenance were 22.5%, 42.5% versus 11.1% and 22.2% (p=0.4), respectively. The univariate analysis identified the following factors associated with the return to IV route: HAD depression score (12 vs 41, p=0.009), HAS anxiety score (12 vs 41, p=0.047) and corticosteroid use (70% vs 100%, p=0.021), in the SC maintenance vs return to IV, respectively. Conclusion: The change of administration route of TCZ and ABA during the first COVID-19 lockdown was infrequently associated with a worsening of RA disease. However, the great majority of the patients (77.4%) request to return to IV route, even without disease activity worsening. This nocebo effect was associated with higher anxiety and depression scores.","Diebold, L.; Wirth, T.; Pradel, V.; Balandraud, N.; Fockens, E.; Paris, C.; Trijau, S.; Lafforgue, P.; Pham, T.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,96,1

171313,171313,171313,Oral ePoster,14.41734,7.791788,2021,"Relational Inequality Theory (RIT) argues that relational claims-making- the process of employer-employee exchange relationships explicitly regarding negotiations over resources and rewards- is the central mechanism that produces social inequalities at work. Yet, the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected employees and employers, possibly altering their behavior in relational claims-making. Hence, this paper aims to explore if long-standing gender inequalities in employer-employee exchange relationships have reproduced or changed during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is examined (1) whether women and men differ in their response to the pandemic regarding expected employer support with further training to work from home (WFH) and (2) whether employers’ decisions on adequate support depend on employees’ gender. The hypotheses were tested using a linked employer-employee dataset (LEEP-B3) with information on German employees’ working conditions before and during COVID-19. OLS regression models predicted no gender differences in training expectations. However, women are more likely to be provided with less training than they expect from their employers. Thus, employers’ decision-making has not been altered, but gender remains an important determinant in relational claims-making, thereby reproducing gender inequalities. Finally, the workforces’ pre-COVID-19 gender ideologies predicted whether mechanisms are mitigated or enhanced. Hence, these findings underline the crucial role of the workplace context in which employer-employee exchange relationships are embedded.","Peters, Eileen",Social Sciences,96,16

One difficulty of undertaking evolutionary analyses over short timescales is the dependency of the inferred evolutionary parameters on the timespan of observation. Here, we characterise the molecular evolutionary dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 and 2009 pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) influenza during the first 12 months of their respective pandemics. We use Bayesian phylogenetic methods to estimate the dates of emergence, evolutionary rates, and growth rates of SARS-CoV-2 and pH1N1 over time and investigate how varying sampling window and dataset sizes affects the accuracy of parameter estimation. We further use a generalised McDonald-Kreitman test to estimate the number of segregating non-neutral sites over time. We find that the inferred evolutionary parameters for both pandemics are time-dependent, and that the inferred rates of SARS-CoV-2 and pH1N1 decline by ~50% and ~100%, respectively, over the course of one year. After at least 4 months since the start of sequence sampling, inferred growth rates and emergence dates remain relatively stable and can be inferred reliably using a logistic growth coalescent model. We show that the time-dependency of the mean substitution rate is due to elevated substitution rates at terminal branches which are 2-4 times higher than those of internal branches for both viruses. The elevated rate at terminal branches is strongly correlated with an increasing number of segregating non-neutral sites, demonstrating the role of purifying selection in generating the time-dependency of evolutionary parameters during pandemics.","Ghafari, M.; du Plessis, L.; Raghwani, J.; Bhatt, S.; Xu, B.; Pybus, O.; Katzourakis, A.",,96,1

The online survey was administered to collect data for this research and the survey results were analyzed using structural equation modeling.SE in technology use had a significant but negative influence on learning engagement and had a positive impact on SE in an online learning environment. SE in time management had a significant positive impact on SE in an online learning environment and learning engagement. SE in an online learning environment also significantly influenced learning engagement.SE in technology use itself did not enhance learning engagement. In addition, indirect effects of SE in technology use and SE in time management on learning engagement through SE in an online learning environment were confirmed in this study.

This process forms blanks instead through the use of local deformations, traditionally imposed utilizing a hemispherically-shaped tool. The dieless nature of this process makes it ideal at low volumes; however, several drawbacks of the process currently inhibit its widespread use in industry, including difficult-to-predict springback and poor surface finish. Another perceived drawback of SPIF is overall low formability. Conventional toolpaths form the blank through a series of successive passes in which the tool is generally constrained to the XY plane. Here a novel toolpath is proposed and tested experimentally and through simulation to determine its viability of improving formability. The toolpath investigated travels radially through the center of the workpiece, rather than along its periphery, in order to generate a more uniform thickness profile. A formability improvement of 21% was found utilizing this strategy.","Grimm, Tyler J.; Mears, Laine",Procedia Manufacturing,96,4

The various estimation methods produced consistent and overall comparable RtEmpirical estimates with generally large correlation coefficients. The Wallinga and Teunis method was the fastest at detecting changes in epidemic dynamics. RtEmpirical estimates were consistent whether using time series of symptomatic PCR-confirmed cases, all PCR-confirmed cases, acute-care hospital admissions, or ICU-care hospital admissions, to proxy trends in true infection incidence. RtModel-based correlated strongly with RtEmpirical and provided an average RtEmpirical. Conclusions: Rt estimations were robust and generated consistent results regardless of the data source or the method of estimation. Findings affirmed an influential role for Rt estimations in guiding national responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, even in resource-limited settings.","Bsat, R.; Chemaitelly, H.; Coyle, P.; Tang, P.; Hasan, M.

There is limited guidance about how to achieve such alignment. Purpose: To describe the range of values clarification methods available to patient decision aid developers, synthesize evidence regarding their relative merits, and foster collection of evidence by offering researchers a proposed set of outcomes to report when evaluating the effects of values clarification methods. Data Sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, CINAHL Study Selection: We included articles that described randomized trials of one or more explicit values clarification methods. From 30,648 records screened, we identified 33 articles describing trials of 43 values clarification methods. Data Extraction: Two independent reviewers extracted details about each values clarification method and its evaluation. Data Synthesis: Compared to control conditions or to implicit values clarification methods, explicit values clarification methods decreased the frequency of values-disgruent choices (risk difference -0.04 95% CI [-0.06 to -0.02], p<.001) and decisional regret (standardized mean difference -0.20 95% CI [-0.29 to -0.11], p<0.001). Multicriteria decision analysis led to more values-congruent decisions than other values clarification methods (Chi-squared(2)=9.25, p=.01). There were no differences between different values clarification methods regarding decisional conflict (Chi-squared(2)=6.08, p=.05). Limitations: Some meta-analyses had high heterogeneity. We grouped values clarification methods into broad categories. Conclusions: Current evidence suggests patient decision aids should include an explicit values clarification method. Developers may wish to specifically consider multicriteria decision analysis. Future evaluations of values clarification methods should report their effects on decisional conflict, decisions made, values congruence, and decisional regret.","Witteman, H.

Through this experience in addition to reflective practice, conceptualizing of ideas and active experimentations, the participating graphic communication students interpret their immersion of culture subjectively and present a piece that communicates the said cultural elements to intended audiences. The present COVID-19 international travel restrictions had disrupted this knowledge acquisition process and posed limits of onsite exploration, engagement with foreign agencies and face-to-face interactions with communities and cultures. However, previous studies had posited the potential of utilizing similar approaches via virtual space, place metaphors and avatar-environment interaction. Henceforth, this paper explored Virtual Reality (VR) technology that replicated environments of foreign destinations and allowed students to map information from this perspective in order to produce a graphic design-based output. This paper intended to further examine the effectiveness of VR by comparing information and feedback of;1)participating students who had firsthand experience of foreign environment, and 2) students who only have second hand experience via VR. This paper also proposed the suitable selection of VR tools based on cost, accessibility, technological requirements and immersion satisfaction via online learning.

However, the mechanisms underlying its success are not understood. Incorporating components of EE protocols into our animal models allows for the exploration of these mechanisms and their role in mitigation. Using a mouse model of maternal immune activation (MIA), the present study explored disruptions in social behavior and associated hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis functioning, and whether a supportive environment could prevent these effects. We show that prenatal immune activation of toll-like receptor 3, by the viral mimetic polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)), led to disrupted maternal care in that dams built poorer quality nests, an effect corrected by EE housing. Standard housed male and female MIA mice engaged in higher rates of repetitive rearing and had lower levels of social interaction, alongside sex-specific expression of several ventral hippocampal neural stress markers. Moreover, MIA males had delayed recovery of plasma corticosterone in response to a novel social encounter. Enrichment housing, likely mediated by improved maternal care, protected against these MIA-induced effects. We also evaluated c-Fos immunoreactivity associated with the novel social experience and found MIA to decrease neural activation in the dentate gyrus. Activation in the hypothalamus was blunted in EE housed animals, suggesting that the putative circuits modulating social behaviors may be different between standard and complex housing environments. These data demonstrate that augmentation of the environment supports parental care and offspring safety/security, which can offset effects of early health adversity by buffering HPA axis dysregulation. Our findings provide further evidence for the viability of EE interventions in maternal and pediatric settings. Highlights ‐ Environmental enrichment (EE) protocols are used clinically to promote rehabilitation ‐ Use of EE in animal models may identify mechanisms underlying clinical successes ‐ Maternal immune activation (MIA) decreased social engagement; this effect was blocked by EE ‐ MIA reduced c-Fos activation in the dentate gyrus, while EE reduced activation in the hypothalamus, in response to social stimuli ‐ EE inhibited MIA-induced HPA dysregulation in ventral hippocampus","Zhao, Xin; Mohammed, Ruqayah; Tran, Hieu; Erickson, Mary; Kentner, Amanda C.",bioRxiv,96,12

METHODS In each hospital, hospitalized adults with Covid-19 pneumonia, were randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive: a) standard of care; or b) emtricitabine/tenofovir; or c) colchicine + rosuvastatin; or d) emtricitabine/tenofovir + colchicine + rosuvastatin. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality within the first 28 days after randomization. Severe adverse events (SAE) were those with a high probability of being treatment-related. RESULTS 633 patients were randomized in 6 hospitals in Bogota, Colombia. Overall, 98% of the patients received glucocorticoids during hospitalization. The cumulative incidence of death through day 28 was 10.7% in the emtricitabine/tenofovir + colchicine + rosuvastatin arm, 14.4% in the colchicine + rosuvastatin arm, 13.8% in the emtricitabine/tenofovir arm, and 17.4% in the standard of care arm, with adjusted risk differences (aRD) against the standard treatment of -0.07 (95% confidence interval [CI], -0.17 to 0.04), aRD -0.03 (95%CI: -0.11 to 0.05) and aRD: -0.05 (95%CI: -0.15 to 0.05), respectively.

In response to this existential crisis, state governments have taken drastic containment measures to limit the spread of the coronavirus. The consequential lockdowns have disrupted production and economic activity and had profound impacts on major industries. The heightened financial risk has significantly slowed down new investments while stoking fears of a looming economic recession. Indeed, the pandemic-induced strong reduction in global demand has resulted in sharp falls in energy prices leading to a temporary market distortion that may impede progress in the deployment of new renewable energy projects. Besides, some countries could be at risk of falling short of their 2020 national binding targets given the lack of effective policies required to facilitate new renewable energy investments. Considering the present impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global energy market, there are opportunities to highlight the important role of renewables while making the case for clean energy investments, especially in the electricity sector. This review aims to provide important insights by analyzing the significant impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global energy market. On the other hand, sustainable energy strategies are also discussed in detail. Finally, lessons learned amidst the costly battle against this invisible enemy could help policymakers and government leaders in identifying the appropriate renewable energy paths for their countries in a post-pandemic future.","Hoang, A.

In the fields of earthquake engineering and engineering seismology, the operational earthquake loss forecasting (OELF) is the research frontier for the assessment of short-term seismic risk. It combines seismicity models, continuously updated based on ground-motion monitoring (i.e., operational earthquake forecasting), with largescale vulnerability models for the built environment and exposure data. With the aim of contributing to the discussion about capabilities and limitations of OELF, the study presented aims at comparing the OELF results and the fatality risk (based on fatality data) related to coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) that, at the time of writing, is perceived as very relevant and required unprecedented risk reduction measures in several countries, most notably Italy. Results show that, at a national scale in Italy, the COVID-19 risk has been higher than the seismic risk during the two pandemic waves even if, at the end of the so-called lockdown, the evolution of the pandemic suggested the possibility (not realized) of reaching a situation of comparable seismic and COVID-19 risks in a few weeks. Because the two risks vary at a local scale, risks comparison was also carried out on a regional basis, showing that, before the beginning of the second wave, in some cases, the seismic risk, as assessed by means of OELF, was larger than the pandemic one.","Chioccarelli, E.; Iervolino, I.",Seismological Research Letters,96,1

For many health professions' education (HPE) leaders, the pandemic has caused unforeseen crises, such as closure of campuses, uncertainty over student numbers and finances and an almost overnight shift to online learning and assessment. Methods: In this article, we explore a range of leadership approaches, some of which are more applicable to times of crisis, and others which will be required to take forward a vision for an uncertain future. We focus on leadership and change, crisis and uncertainty, conceptualising 'leadership' as comprising the three interrelated elements of leadership, management and followership. These elements operate at various levels - intrapersonal, interpersonal, organisational and global systems levels. Results: Effective leaders are often seen as being able to thrive in times of crisis - the traditional 'hero leader' - however, leadership in rapidly changing, complex and uncertain situations needs to be much more nuanced, adaptive and flexible. Conclusion: From the many leadership theories and approaches available, we suggest some specific approaches that leaders might choose in order to work with their teams and organisations through these rapidly changing and challenging times.

This article presents the results of research carried out among samples of Polish, Lithuanian and Spanish remote workers concerning working conditions in organizations and at home, and the potential impact of some professional hazards from home-based telework. On the contrary to earlier published papers on pandemic-induced telework that focused on how the limitations at home of first-time remote workers impacted on their well-being and work–family balance, our research contributes to a more recent endeavor that focuses the analysis on the work design perspective. The results of the survey indicate that employees felt more stressed and in conflict at their remote workstations when they had to telework during the lockdown, and that this negative output was significantly related to the deterioration of some working dimensions like space, quality and design but not to the perception of professional hazards from home-based telework. According to our research, the forced situation seemed not to be a favorable factor for implementing changes in light of the insufficient technical and organizational preparation of employers as well as the employees’ mental preparation. It should be necessary to update sequentially the results of the epidemic-induced telework and conduct research for various stages of the pandemic and the subsequent economic recovery. This could help popularize remote work as one of the tools of the labor market in the future and as a tool for treating labor resources as an element of sustainable development.","Rymaniak, Janusz Lis Katarzyna Davidavičienė Vida Pérez-Pérez Manuela Martínez-Sánchez Ángel",Sustainability,96,26

Cognitive interventions and exercise have been found to be efficacious in improving cognitive function in several clinical populations (e.g., older adults with mild cognitive impairment and dementia). However, the utility of cognitive interventions has not been systematically reviewed in HD. This systematic review aims to examine the efficacy of cognitive and physical interventions on cognitive function in HD. Methods: Electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CENTRAL) were searched through till 10 May 2021 for interventional studies investigating the effect of cognition-oriented treatments and physical exercise on cognitive function in individuals with HD, compared to any control or no control. The primary outcome is change on objective measures of cognition. Additional outcomes include change in psychosocial, functional and neuroimaging measures. Variations of effects based on population and study factors will be considered. Risk of bias will be assessed using the Cochrane RoB 2 tool and ROBINS-I tool. Where appropriate, outcomes will be pooled using random-effects meta-analyses, heterogeneity will be examined using tau2 and I2 statistics, and moderators will be examined using meta-regression models. Discussion: This review will systematically evaluate the efficacy of cognitive and physical interventions on improving cognitive function in HD. The eligibility criteria and planned analyses will allow for a comprehensive assessment of certainty in the evidence that will inform future trials and clinical practice.

The crisis highlights more general concerns about occupational licensing laws, yet convincing empirical evidence on the degree to which such laws have inhibited entry into health care professions is scarce. In this study, we indirectly examine how occupational licensing affects the choice to become an emergency medical technician (EMT) by exploiting the demand-side shock from the Affordable Care Act (ACA). We find suggestive evidence that while the demand-side shock from the ACA increased the likelihood of being an EMT, this effect was substantially moderated by more stringent occupational licensing laws. The implied effects for young individuals in the most careful specification suggests virtually complete offset;the ACA demand-side shock would increase entry by 18 percentage points, while occupational licensing restrictions reduce entry by a similar magnitude. © 2021 The Southern Economic Association.","Yelowitz, A.; Ingram, S.

Three periods are identified : before, during and after the 1st wave of COVID-19. Over all these periods, a sub-mortality of -3.3 % is obtained at the national level. However, if we restrict the analysis to the period during the first wave and to the cantons most affected by the virus, we obtain an important excess mortality, up to more than 80 % in Ticino, showing that these calculations depend crucially on when, where and for whom the deaths are counted. Such an analysis will have to be repeated once the 2nd wave is over in order to estimate the overall impact of the epidemic on excess mortality in Switzerland.","Rousson, Valentin; Chaouch, Aziz; Bochud, Murielle",Revue medicale suisse,96,12

In our two centres study sixty patients were operated; 30 were treated with Lichtenstein repair with polypropylene mesh (L group) and 30 with ProGrip mesh (P group) with or without fixation. The primary parameter measured was intensity of postoperative pain using visual analogue scale (VAS); other outcomes included assessment of early and late complication. VAS was assessed in 7 days and 4 months of the postoperative period. Our results show that VAS scored at the 7th postoperative day was 1.5 for the ProGrip mesh versus 4.4 in Lichtenstein repair group. The difference between groups was statistically significant (P=0.001). Surgery duration was significantly shorter in the P group (24.9 vs. 58.3 min; P=0.001). No recurrence was observed at 3 months in both groups. The 3-months follow-up has shown that time necessary to return to daily routine activity was significantly lower in the P group during the (P=0.001).

Furthermore, it can be useful to find if there is a stage that marks the transition to adulthood. Finally, as the Romans are considerate to be great codifiers of laws, it seems important to study the Roman law to understand the legal conception of adolescence at this period. SUBJECTS AND METHODS A literature review has been done about studies published between 1962 and 2015. Those publications were found in some historical databases (as Persée, Cairns, J-Stor, OpenEdition) and in academic libraries. RESULTS In the Greek cities, the adolescent, at 18 years old, has to do a military service called the ephebia. At the end of this formation, the young man, aged of 20 years old, comes back to his city. However, he has to continue his (intellectual) training until about his 30 years old. Generally, at this age, a man marries a young girl and becomes a respected adult. In the Roman law, there is no conception of legal age for the majority: the young people stay under the authority of the pater familias (father of the family) until the death of the father. If the father is dead: the boy becomes a pupil and has a specific juridical status until his 25 years. Two important stages exist for the young Romans: wearing the toga virilis (toga of manhood) and the wedding. CONCLUSIONS There is an evolution in the perception of the adolescence during the Antiquity: for the Greeks, the adolescence ends at 20 years old with an important stage, the ephebia. In the Roman law, there is no legal age because everyone lives under the authority of the pater familias.","Jassogne, Gaëtan",Psychiatria Danubina,96,1

Therefore, we investigated the causative agents of WD by using electron microscopy, ELISA, RT-PCR, and nested PCR from 97 fecal samples of 32 WD-affected herds collected from 8 provinces during 2002-2004. The bovine coronavirus (BoCV) was consistently detected in all herds with WD. Of other pathogens, only coccidian oocyts were inconsistently but concurrently detected with BoCV. Ten isolates were identified as BoCV by immune electron microscope, immunofluorescent test and ELISA with antiserum to BoCV, and RT-PCR. From these results, it is concluded that WD caused by BoCV occurred in relatively high frequency and was widespread in Korea. The results provide important epidemiological data for the control and establishment of a surveillance system for WD in Korea.","Jeong, Jae-Ho; Kim, Gye-Yeop; Yoon, Soon-Seek; Park, Su-Jin; Kim, You-Jung; Sung, Chang-Min; Jang, Oh-Jun; Shin, Sung-Shik; Koh, Hong-Bum; Lee, Bong-Joo; Lee, Chai-Yong; Kang, Mun-Il; Kim, Hyun-Jin; Park, Nam-Yong; Cho, Kyoung-Oh",The Journal of veterinary medical science,96,28

Initially, a 19-nucleotide tag was inserted into the start of gene 4a of MHV strain A59 with the N gene deletion mutant Alb4 as the recipient virus. In further work, the entire gene for the green fluorescent protein (GFP) was inserted in place of gene 4, creating the currently largest known RNA virus. The expression of GFP was demonstrated by Western blot analysis of infected cell lysates; however, the level of GFP expression was not sufficient to allow detection of fluorescence of viral plaques. Northern blot analysis of transcripts of GFP recombinants showed the expected alteration of the pattern of the nested MHV subgenomic mRNAs. Surprisingly, though, GFP recombinants also produced an RNA species that was the same size as wild-type mRNA4. Analysis of the 5' end of this species revealed that it was actually a collection of mRNAs originating from 10 different genomic fusion sites, none possessing a canonical intergenic sequence. The finding of these aberrant mRNAs suggests that long-range RNA or the ribonucleoprotein structure of the MHV genome can sometimes be the sole determinant of the site of initiation of transcription.","Fischer, F; Stegen, C F; Koetzner, C A; Masters, P S",Journal of virology,96,2

Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf21) cells expressing G of the RV strain CVS (Gcvs-Sf21 cells) bind specifically to neuroblastoma cells of different species but not to any other cell type (fibroblast, myoblast, epithelial, or glioma). Attachment to mouse neuroblastoma NG108-15 cells is abolished by previous treatment of Gcvs-Sf2 cells with anti-G antibody. Substitutions for lysine at position 330 and for arginine at position 333 in RV G greatly reduce interaction between Gcvs-Sf21 cells and NG108-15 cells. These data are consistent with in vivo results: an avirulent RV mutant bearing the same double mutation is not able to infect sensory neurons or motoneurons (P. Coulon, J.-P. Ternaux, A. Flamand, and C. Tuffereau, J. Virol. 72:273-278, 1998) after intramuscular inoculation into a mouse. Furthermore, infection of NG108-15 cells by RV but not by vesicular stomatitis virus leads to a reduction of the number of binding sites at the neuronal-cell surface. Our data strongly suggest that these specific attachment sites on neuroblastoma cells represent a neuronal receptor(s) used by RV to infect certain types of neurons in vivo.","Tuffereau, C; Benejean, J; Alfonso, A M; Flamand, A; Fishman, M C",Journal of virology,96,16

RNA sequences involved in the latter process are poorly defined. Since many sequences involved in picornavirus replication form RNA structures, we searched the genome, other than the untranslated regions, for predicted local secondary structural elements and identified a 61-nucleotide (nt) stem-loop in the region encoding the 2C protein. Covariance analysis suggested the structure was well conserved in the Enterovirus genus of the Picornaviridae. Site-directed mutagenesis, disrupting the structure without affecting the 2C product, destroyed genome viability and suggested that the structure was required in the positive sense for function. Recovery of revertant viruses suggested that integrity of the structure was critical for function, and analysis of replication demonstrated that nonviable mutants did not synthesize negative strands. Our conclusion, that this RNA secondary structure constitutes a novel poliovirus cis-acting replication element (CRE), is supported by the demonstration that subgenomic replicons bearing lethal mutations in the native structure can be restored to replication competence by the addition of a second copy of the 61-nt wild-type sequence at another location within the genome. This poliovirus CRE functionally resembles an element identified in rhinovirus type 14 (K. L. McKnight and S. M. Lemon, RNA 4:1569-1584, 1998) and the cardioviruses (P. E. Lobert, N. Escriou, J.

In this study, to understand the molecular basis of the different susceptibilities to TNF-alpha between FIV-infected and uninfected cells, we examined the expression of TNF receptors and the activation of the caspase and NF-kappaB pathways. Expression levels of TNFR I and TNFR II mRNAs were similar between uninfected and FIV-infected CRFK cells. To understand the role of caspases in TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis, we examined the effect of three different classes of caspase inhibitors, Z-VAD-FMK, Ac-YVAD-CMK, and Z-DEVD-FMK, on the TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis in FIV-infected cells. Pretreatment with each of these caspase inhibitors protected FIV-infected CRFK cells from TNF-alpha-induced cell death. Moreover, one of the caspase substrates, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, was shown to be cleaved after TNF-alpha treatment in FIV-infected CRFK cells but not in uninfected CRFK cells. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay using an NF-kappaB motif oligonucleotide and promoter assay using an NF-kappaB luciferase reporter construct indicated that TNF-alpha treatment had induced activation of NF-kappaB in both FIV-infected and uninfected CRFK cells. The present study indicates that TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis in FIV-infected CRFK cells is mediated by the activation of the caspase cascade, but not by either upregulation of TNF receptor or inhibition of NF-kappaB.","Mizuno, T; Goto, Y; Baba, K; Masuda, K; Ohno, K; Tsujimoto, H",Virology,96,26

In this study, we investigated the relationships between dose and delivery parameters as they pertain to toxicity and response in surgically resectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). PATIENTS AND METHODS Twenty-five patients with resectable HCC were randomly assigned and divided into four groups, each receiving either bland, 25 mg, 50 mg or 75 mg of doxorubicin loaded Super Absorbent Polymer microspheres, with 24 patients undergoing surgical resection. Response Evaluation and Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.0 and European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL)-based volumetric response was performed at one month and surgical resection of the reference tumor was performed at two months. Adverse events were collected at regular intervals. RESULTS Fifty-six percent of patients demonstrated complete response according to EASL criteria as opposed to 0% according to RECIST (v1.0) criteria. Residual tumor was identified in all groups (0 mg: 35%±28.5%; 25 mg: 42%±30.4%; 50 mg: 3.6%±3.3%; and 75 mg: 49.29%±32.6%. A total of 112 adverse events of grades 1-3 occurred (average 5.1 per patient), with no grade 4 or 5. No difference was noted between bland embolic and drug-loaded groups. Subset analysis did demonstrate a significantly increased degree of necrosis in the 50 mg-loaded group (p=0.018). Strong correlation existed between arterial phase Computer Tomography EASL-based response and histopathology (r=0.81; p<0.0001). All groups had residual tumor. CONCLUSION Histology correlates strongly with one-month post-procedural imaging and response optimized at 50 mg of loading per vial.

Monoclonal antibody 57.16 is directed against the A site on the peplomer, neutralizes virus, and recognizes TGEV and PRCV. Monoclonal antibody 57.110 is directed against the X site on the peplomer, but does not neutralize virus, and recognizes only TGEV. Antibodies directed against TGEV and PRCV could be detected in a blocking ELISA, using MAB 57.16 as a conjugate. Antibodies directed against both viruses were detectable as early as 1 week after inoculation. Antibody titers correlated well with those in a virus-neutralization test. Antibodies against TGEV could be detected in a blocking ELISA, using MAB 57.110 as a conjugate. Such antibodies were not induced by a PRCV infection. In the blocking ELISA, using MAB 57.110 as a conjugate, antibodies were detectable as early as 2 weeks after inoculation. There was a significant difference between antibody titers reached after infection with various TGEV strains, however. This difference is ascribed to a variation of the antigenic site defined by MAB 57.110 in TGEV strains.

Drug repurposing focuses on researching new indications for existing drugs and can reduce the challenges faced in drug development. Objective The current review intended to examine the current status of drugs being repurposed for COVID-19 treatment. Design The research team performed a literature review, searching relevant literature databases to find abstracts of relevant articles in journals published from 2010 until May 16, 2020. The sources of data included Google Scholar, PubMed, and ScienceDirect. The search terms used included repositioning of drugs, repurposing of drugs and COVID-19 therapy, and SARS-CoV-2 therapy. Setting The research team conducted this study at the Department of Pharmacology, Punjab University College of Pharmacy, University of the Punjab, Lahore, Pakistan; Mangalbare Hospital, Morang, Nepal; and Dr Iwamura Memorial Hospital, Bhaktapur, Nepal. Results Repurposing of drugs from different pharmacological groups including antivirals like remdesivir, lopinavir, ritonavir, arbidol, oseltamivir, penciclovir, favipiravir, ganciclovir, and ribavirin; other antibiotics like azithromycin, ivermectin, eravacycline, valrubicin, streptomycin, nitazoxanide, teicoplanin, caspofungin, and colistin; and other agents like hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, tocilizumab, camostat, nafamostat, carfilzomib, interferon, aprepitant, and dexamethasone can be considered for COVID-19 therapy. Conclusions Although current results are promising, limitations to drug repurposing, such as a low success rate and the possibility of adverse events, can't be overlooked.

Copper and UV-BH treatment suppressed growth but more in N. muscorum which was accompanied by significant accumulation of Cu. Nitrate and nitrite uptake rates and activities of nitrogen assimilating enzymes i.e. nitrate reductase (NR), nitrite reductase (NiR), glutamine synthetase (GS) and glutamate synthase (GOGAT) except glutamate dehydrogenase activity (GDH; aminating) were decreased following treatments of Cu and UV-BH, and under combined treatments the effect was greater. On contrary, UV-BL declined Cu toxicity significantly. The study concludes that Cu and UV-BH suppressed the activity of NR, NiR, GS and GOGAT (except GDH) hence decreased growth. However, UV-BL showed cross tolerance in test organisms against Cu toxicity up to certain extent. Phormidium foveolarum is comparatively less sensitive against UV-BH and excess Cu, a situation likely exists in nature, hence it may be used as a biofertilizer for sustainable agriculture.","Singh, V P; Srivastava, P K; Prasad, S M",Cellular and molecular biology,96,12

This review will specifically focus on the challenges that face the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in order to effectively implement surveillance programs making use of advances in health information technology. Data collection was performed through a web-based retrieval of reports and articles and via an interview with an epidemiologist in the Saudi Ministry of Health Surveillance unit. Based on the results of this research, it was found that the use of technology has led to an improvement in communication between various stakeholders (e.g. clinicians, epidemiologists, and decision makers) by providing timely and accurate information needed for informed decision making. However, implementing an ideal model of surveillance systems in Saudi Arabia faces many challenges particularly in training healthcare providers to be qualified and competent enough to ensure the successful implementation of a disease surveillance system.","Al Saleem, Nouf; Househ, Mowafa; El Metwally, Ashraf",Studies in health technology and informatics,96,16

SETTINGS A survey was carried out at the Hong Kong-China cross border checkpoint in the middle of the epidemic. PARTICIPANTS A total of 839 Hong Kong adult residents returning to Hong Kong from mainland China were surveyed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Practice of preventive measures and relevant behaviours and attitudes. RESULTS Around 40% of the respondents were using masks all or most of the time in public places or washing their hands frequently (>10 times per day) and about one third avoided visiting crowded places in mainland China. Such figures were however lower than those practised by the general public in Hong Kong. SARS related perceptions, such as perceived risk of transmission and efficacy, etc, were associated with mask use and not visiting crowded places, but not with hand washing, which was associated with duration of stay. Gender differences were also observed. Around 70% of the travellers would have delayed medical consultation for influenza-like illness in China; 12.7% would not wear masks during such episodes of illness. Furthermore, about 30% of the respondents used to wear masks in Hong Kong but not in mainland China. CONCLUSIONS The findings have implications on cross border prevention of SARS. It seems that those travelling during the SARS epidemic were a ""self selected"" group, and they were using less preventive measures. Special attention and intervention need to be provided to travellers to prevent a second wave cross border transmission of the disease.","Lau, Joseph T F; Yang, Xilin; Tsui, H Y; Pang, Ellie",Journal of epidemiology and community health,96,28

METHODS We have used an online electronic survey of a convenient sample of doctors from 40 countries using a multiple-choice online questionnaire, including three domains. 424 out of 456 respondents provided adequate responses. RESULTS Most respondents were from medical (51.5%) and surgical (11.8%) specialties. Over half of the respondents practiced in academic centers and one fifth in the private sector. Coronavirus pandemic induced frequent changes in practice, such as seeing fewer patients in clinics than usual (34.9%) and utilization of telemedicine (31.3%). A significant disruption in medical education activities and residents' training was observed, resulting in the cancellation of many activities such as grand rounds, departmental and multidisciplinary meetings, and case conferences with over-reliance on virtual and on-demand educational sessions. The residents' supervision and support were significantly reduced. Almost 16% of respondents were involved in research work on coronavirus pandemic while a third continued their usual research activity, but half were not involved in any research at the time of the survey. CONCLUSIONS The COVID19 pandemic has promoted new practices in the field as the recourse to telemedicine, virtual conferences, and thematic researches on COVID-19. The unexpected situation has opened new prospects for future doctors' preparation for these new means of practice and learning of medicine.","Beshyah, Salem A; Ibrahim, Wanis H; Hajjaji, Issam M; Ben Mami, Faika; Arekat, Mona; Abdelmannan, Dima K",La Tunisie medicale,96,11

While MHV strain A59 appeared to induce IFN-beta gene transcription and low levels of nuclear translocation of the IFN-beta transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3), MHV did not induce IFN-beta protein production during the course of infection in L2 mouse fibroblast cells. In addition, MHV was able to significantly decrease the level of IFN-beta protein induced by both Newcastle disease virus (NDV) and Sendai virus infections, without targeting it for proteasomal degradation and without altering the nuclear translocation of IRF-3 or IFN-beta mRNA production or stability. These results indicate that MHV infection causes an inhibition of IFN-beta production at a posttranscriptional level, without altering RNA or protein stability. In contrast, MHV induced IFN-beta mRNA and protein production in the brains of infected animals, suggesting that the inhibitory mechanisms observed in vitro are not enough to prevent IFN-alpha/beta production in vivo. Furthermore, MHV replication is highly resistant to IFN-alpha/beta action, as indicated by unimpaired MHV replication in L2 cells pretreated with IFN-beta. However, when L2 cells were coinfected with MHV and NDV in the presence of IFN-beta, NDV, but not MHV, replication was inhibited. Thus, rather than disarming the antiviral activity induced by IFN-beta pretreatment completely, MHV may be inherently resistant to some aspects of the antiviral state induced by IFN-beta. These findings show that MHV employs unique strategies to circumvent the IFN-alpha/beta response at multiple steps.","Roth-Cross, Jessica K; Martínez-Sobrido, Luis; Scott, Erin P; García-Sastre, Adolfo; Weiss, Susan R",Journal of virology,96,8

The study aimed to determine plasma concentrations of vitamin C and tocotrienols after supplementation of both vitamins in young male adults. MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 64 police recruits were randomly assigned to one of these groups: (a) 500 mg vitamin C (Vitamin C), (b) 200 mg Tocovid (Tocotrienol), (c) combination of 500 mg vitamin C and 200 mg Tocovid (Combination) or (d) placebo (Placebo) for eight-weeks of supplementation followed by six-week washout period. RESULTS In Combination group, mean plasma vitamin C concentration significantly increased from baseline 2.86 +/- 1.19 mg/L to 10.37 +/- 1.29 mg/L and 15.63 +/- 1.27 mg/L after four- and eight-week supplementation, respectively. The corresponding figures for alpha-, delta- and gamma-tocotrienols were 9.9 +/- 2.5 ng/ml to 104.1 +/- 19.8 ng/ml and 112.8 +/- 38.0 ng/ml; 2.5 +/- 0.9 ng/ml to 29.9 +/- 7.0 ng/ml and 17.9 +/- 4.7 ng/ml; 19.2 +/- 3.1 ng/ml to 75.2 +/- 24.1 ng/ml and 161.7 +/- 49.9 ng/ml, respectively. In Vitamin C group, plasma vitamin C concentrations were significantly increased. Conversely, concentration of plasma vitamin C in Tocotrienol group increased from baseline of 2.72 +/- 0.20 mg/L to 6.80 +/- 0.63 mg/L and 8.9 +/- 0.77 mg/L respectively. Plasma concentrations of alpha-, delta- and gamma-tocotrienols in this group were significantly elevated. After 6-week washout period, all the elevated concentrations returned to basal levels.

This study examined the effect of a fermented dairy product containing the probiotic Lactobacillus casei DN-114 001 (verum) on the incidence of respiratory and gastrointestinal common infectious diseases (CIDs) and on immune functions in healthy shift workers. METHODS The study was single-center, randomized, double-blind, and controlled. Volunteers received 200 g/day of verum (n = 500) or control product (n = 500) for 3 months; 1-month follow-up was carried out. RESULTS The cumulated number of CIDs (primary outcome) was not significantly different between groups. Because the Poisson distribution of the primary parameter did not fully fit the observed data, a post hoc categorical analysis was applied and showed a significantly lower cumulated number of CIDs in the verum group during the product consumption phase (odds ratio [OR] = 0.75, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.59-0.95, p = 0.017). Verum also reduced the proportion of volunteers experiencing at least 1 CID (43% vs. 51%, p = 0.005), increased the time to the first occurrence of CID (p = 0.017) in the whole population, and reduced the cumulated number of CIDs in the subgroup of smokers (p = 0.033). In the course of CID, cumulated duration of fever was lower in the verum group (in the whole study phase) (p = 0.022), and an increase in leukocyte, neutrophil, and natural killer (NK) cell counts and activity (p = 0.047 to p < 0.001) was observed compared with control group. Verum was safe and well tolerated. CONCLUSION The results indicate that daily consumption of a fermented dairy product containing Lactobacillus casei DN-114 001 could reduce the risk of common infections in stressed individuals such as shift workers.","Guillemard, Eric; Tanguy, Jérôme; Flavigny, Ann'Laure; de la Motte, Stephan; Schrezenmeir, Juergen",Journal of the American College of Nutrition,96,1

This method was used to analyze TGEV mutants for hemagglutinating activity. Recently, mutants with strongly reduced enteropathogenicity that have point mutations or a deletion of four amino acids within residues 145 to 155 of the S protein have been described. Here, we show that in addition to their reduced pathogenicity, these mutants also have lost hemagglutinating activity.

The TMDs of hepatitis C virus (HCV) envelope proteins E1 and E2 are extreme examples of the multifunctionality of such membrane-spanning sequences. Indeed, they possess a signal sequence function in their C-terminal half, play a major role in endoplasmic reticulum localization of E1 and E2, and are potentially involved in the assembly of these envelope proteins. These multiple functions are supposed to be essential for the formation of the viral envelope. As for the other viruses of the family Flaviviridae, these anchor domains are composed of two stretches of hydrophobic residues separated by a short segment containing at least one fully conserved charged residue. Replacement of these charged residues by an alanine in HCV envelope proteins led to an alteration of all of the functions performed by their TMDs, indicating that these functions are tightly linked together. These data suggest that the charged residues of the TMDs of HCV glycoproteins play a key role in the formation of the viral envelope.","Cocquerel, L; Wychowski, C; Minner, F; Penin, F; Dubuisson, J",Journal of virology,96,1

DESIGN A model simulating the spread of a pathogen transmitted by direct contact (such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus) was constructed. The modulation of pathogen dissemination attending changes in clinically relevant pathogen- and institution-specific factors was then systematically examined. SETTING AND PATIENTS The model was configured as a hypothetical 24-bed intensive care unit. The model can be parameterized with different pathogen transmissibilities, durations of caregiver and/or patient contamination, and caregiver allocation and flow patterns. INTERVENTIONS Pathogen- and institution-specific factors examined included pathogen transmissibility, duration of caregiver contamination, regional cohorting of contaminated or infected patients, delayed detection and isolation of newly contaminated patients, reduction of the number of caregiver visits, and alteration of caregiver allocation among patients. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS The model predicts the probability that a given fraction of the population will become contaminated or infected with the pathogen of interest under specified spatial, initial prevalence, and dynamic conditions. Per-encounter pathogen acquisition risk and the duration of caregiver pathogen carriage most strongly affect dissemination. Regional cohorting and rapid detection and isolation of contaminated patients each markedly diminish the likelihood of dissemination even absent other interventions. Strategies reducing ""crossover"" between caregiver domains diminish the likelihood of more widespread dissemination. CONCLUSIONS Spatially explicit discrete element models, such as the model presented, may prove useful for analyzing the transmission of pathogens within the intensive care unit.","Hotchkiss, John R; Strike, David G; Simonson, Dana A; Broccard, Alain F; Crooke, Philip S",Critical care medicine,96,1

A second group of 28 rats received injections of NDMA in an identical manner but without ether exposure. In the unanesthetized animals blood levels of NDMA declined with a half-life of 11 min; by contrast essentially constant blood levels of NDMA were observed in ether-treated animals for 120 min after removal from the anesthetic. The apparent total systemic clearance for the 5-h experiment was reduced from 43 ml/min/kg without ether to 5 ml/min/kg with ether.

METHODS A prospective, multicenter, observational study was conducted at tertiary care hospitals in Northern Italy from September 1998 to December 2000. RESULTS A final diagnosis of RTI was obtained in 40 cases (7.8%), 27 (67.5%) with lower RTI and 13 (32.5%) with upper RTI. The most common RTIs were pneumonia (35%) and pulmonary tuberculosis (15%). A white blood cell count > or = 10,000 and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate > or = 20 mm/h were independently associated with a final diagnosis of RTI; onset of symptoms at > or = 16 days and > or = 75% neutrophils were independently associated with lower RTI. An RS was identified in 51 (9.9%) of 515 travelers. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of a diagnosis of RS for a final diagnosis of RTI were 67.5%, 94.9%, 52.9%, and 97.2%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Pneumonia and pulmonary tuberculosis were frequent among foreign-born and national travelers with fever admitted to a tertiary care hospital. Half of the pneumonia cases did not present with an RS at first clinical examination.","Matteelli, Alberto; Beltrame, Anna; Saleri, Nuccia; Bisoffi, Zeno; Allegri, Roberto; Volonterio, Alberto; Giola, Massimo; Perini, Paolo; Galimberti, Laura; Visonà, Raffaella; Donisi, Alessra; Giani, Gloria; Scalzini, Alfredo; Gaiera, Giovanni; Ravasio, Laura; Anna Carvalho, C C; Gulletta, Maurizio",Journal of travel medicine,96,32

In 2000, asthma accounted for 4,487 deaths, approximately 465,000 hospitalizations, an estimated 1.8 million emergency department (ED) visits, and approximately 10.4 million physician office visits among persons of all ages. To provide prevalence data for state and local health department asthma programs, the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) collects data each year from the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and three U.S. territories. This report summarizes asthma prevalence data for adults collected from the 2001 BRFSS survey and from the eight states that used the adult asthma history module. Findings from BRFSS indicate that approximately 7.2% of U.S. adults have current asthma. ED visits for asthma varied more than any other characteristic among the eight states that used the adult asthma history module. In Mississippi, 67.3% of respondents with current asthma reported no ED visits during the preceding 12 months, compared with 87.6% in Washington state.

METHODS: A web-based study was conducted among members of the Italian Society of Psycho-Oncology between May 29 and June 5, 2020. RESULTS: A total of 237 members, aged 28-72 years, completed the COVID-19 Peritraumatic Distress Index (CPDI), Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and HOPE questionnaires; 86.92% were female, 58.65% worked in hospitals, 21.10% were exposed to COVID-19, 11.39% experienced peritraumatic distress, and 3.38% had posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms. Peritraumatic distress was associated with living alone (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 3.05; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.41-8.13), using sleep remedies (AOR 3.79; 95% CI 1.41-10.21), and the perception of being avoided by family or friends because of work (AOR 2.69; 95% CI 1.02-7.11); high HOPE-Agency scores were associated with the absence of peritraumatic stress (AOR 0.40; 95% CI 0.16-0.96) after adjustment for age and sex. CONCLUSIONS: Psycho-oncologists showed greater resilience than other healthcare workers as they are trained to help others, but also to review their own values and behavior in light of stressful events. Of interest is the association between peritraumatic distress and social isolation, real or perceived. Healthcare institutions should pay attention to the mental well-being of their employees by promoting distress screening using simple tools such as the CPDI and implementing support interventions. Psycho-oncology associations should introduce policies aimed at developing a sense of social connectedness by providing an interactive system of orientation and scientific reference.","Costantini, Anna; Mazzotti, Eva; Serpentini, Samantha; Piattelli, Angela; Scarponi, Dorella; De Benedetta, Gabriella; Bellani, Marco",Tumori,96,1

In Germany, the SARS-CoV-2 lockdown caused a substantial decrease in mobility, possibly affecting noise levels. The aim is to analyze the effects of the lockdown measures on noise levels in the densely populated Ruhr Area. We focus on the analysis of noise levels before and during lockdown considering different land use types, weekdays, and time of day. METHODS: We used data from 22 automatic sound devices of the SALVE (Acoustic Quality and Health in Urban Environments) project, running since 2019 in Bochum, Germany. We performed a pre/during lockdown comparison of A-weighted equivalent continuous sound pressure levels. The study period includes five weeks before and five weeks during the SARS-CoV-2 induced administrative lockdown measures starting on 16 March 2020. We stratified our data by land use category (LUC), days of the week, and daytime. RESULTS: We observed highest noise levels pre-lockdown in the 'main street' and 'commercial areas' (68.4 ± 6.7 dB resp. 61.0 ± 8.0 dB), while in 'urban forests' they were lowest (50.9 ± 6.6 dB). A distinct mean overall noise reduction of 5.1 dB took place, with noise reductions occurring in each LUC. However, the magnitude of noise levels differed considerably between the categories. Weakest noise reductions were found in the 'main street' (3.9 dB), and strongest in the 'urban forest', 'green space', and 'residential area' (5.9 dB each). CONCLUSIONS: Our results are in line with studies from European cities. Strikingly, all studies report noise reductions of about 5 dB. Aiming at a transformation to a health-promoting urban mobility can be a promising approach to mitigating health risks of noise in cities. Overall, the experiences currently generated by the pandemic offer data for best practices and policies for the development of healthy urban transportation-the effects of a lower traffic and more tranquil world were experienced firsthand by people during this time.","Hornberg, Jonas; Haselhoff, Timo; Lawrence, Bryce T; Fischer, Jonas L; Ahmed, Salman; Gruehn, Dietwald; Moebus, Susanne",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),96,11

However, data are lacking on its efficacy for the treatment of chronic cancer pain. The purpose of this study was to determine the analgesic efficacy of pregabalin combined with morphine in the management of pancreatic cancer pain. METHODS: This study reviewed patients who were prescribed morphine and 150 mg/d pregabalin between 1 January 2017 and 10 November 2018 in our institute. The primary outcomes of this study were the average pain score and dose of morphine. Secondary outcomes included characters of breakthrough cancer pain, functional interference related to pain, anxiety/depression status, and incidence of treatment-related adverse events during the study. RESULTS: A total of 240 patients with pain related to pancreatic cancer were included in the study. The results showed that patients of both combination therapy group (pregabalin+morphine) and monotherapy group (morphine) achieved similar analgesic efficacy, demonstrated by NRS (2.4 ± 0.9 vs. 2.6 ± 0.9; combination vs. monotherapy) at the end of the study. Mean daily dose of morphine used in the combination group was significant lower compared to monotherapy group (39.5 ± 16.0 mg vs. 61.5 ± 19.3 mg, net difference 23.5, 95% CI: 18.4-28.6, p < â0.001). The change of functional interference score related to pain was significantly different between combination and monotherapy group (12.0 ± 0.4 vs. 9.8 ± 4.9; net difference, 2.3; 95% CI: 1.1-3.3; p < 0.001). Patients in combination therapy group had experienced shorter duration of breakthrough cancer pain than those in monotherapy group (X2 p < 0.001, Cramer's V:0.36). The incidence of somnolence, dizziness, and cognitive dysfunction were significantly higher in the combination group compared to monotherapy group. No serious treatment-related side effects were observed.

However, the exact molecular mechanism of SFJDC remains unclear. The present study aims to determine the potential pharmacological mechanisms of SFJDC in the treatment of COVID-19 based on network pharmacology. METHODS: The network pharmacology-based strategy includes collection and analysis of active compounds and target genes, network construction, identification of key compounds and hub target genes, KEGG and GO enrichment, recognition and analysis of main modules, as well as molecule docking. RESULTS: A total of 214 active chemical compounds and 339 target genes of SFJDC were collected. Of note, 5 key compounds ( ß -sitosterol, luteolin, kaempferol, quercetin, and stigmasterol) and 10 hub target genes (TP53, AKT1, NCOA1, EGFR, PRKCA, ANXA1, CTNNB1, NCOA2, RELA and FOS) were identified based on network analysis. The hub target genes mainly enriched in pathways including MAPK signaling pathway, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway and cAMP signaling pathway, which could be the underlying pharmacological mechanisms of SFJDC for treating COVID-19. Moreover, the key compounds had high binding activity with three typical target genes. CONCLUSIONS: By network pharmacology analysis, SFJDC was found to effectively improve immune function and reduce inflammatory responses based on its key compounds, hub target genes, and the relevant pathways. These findings may provide valuable evidence for explaining how SFJDC exerting the therapeutic effects on COVID-19, providing a holistic view for further clinical application.","Zhuang, Zhenjie; Zhong, Xiaoying; Zhang, Huanhuan; Chen, Huiqi; Huang, Boxiang; Lin, Dongqun; Wen, Junmao",Combinatorial chemistry &amp; high throughput screening (Online),96,22

It has been recently proposed that ion pair production could explain the higher-than-expected beam currents extracted from these ion sources, therefore opening the door for laser-assisted enhancement of the negative ion yield. We have tested this hypothesis by measuring the effect of various pulsed diode lasers on the O$^-$ beam current produced from Al$_2$O$_3$ cathode of a cesium sputter ion source. It is expected that the ion pair production of O$^-$ requires populating the 5d electronic states of neutral cesium, thus implying that the process should be provoked only with specific wavelengths. Our experimental results provide evidence for the existence of a wavelength-dependent photo-assisted effect but cast doubt on its alleged resonant nature as the prompt enhancement of beam current can be observed with laser wavelengths exceeding a threshold photon energy. The beam current transients observed during the laser pulses suggest that the magnitude and longevity of the beam current enhancement depends on the cesium balance on the cathode surface. We conclude that the photo-assisted negative ion production could be of practical importance as it can more than double the extracted beam current under certain operational settings of the ion source.","Tarvainen, O.; Kronholm, R.; Laitinen, M.; Reponen, M.; Julin, J.; Toivanen, V.; Napari, M.; Marttinen, M.; Faircloth, D.; Koivisto, H.; Sajavaara, T.",,96,16

Dysregulated innate immune response in the lung due to viral-entry mediated angiotensin-I-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor downregulation causes endothelial injury in the pulmonary vasculature, inflammatory cytokine release, increased thrombin generation and impaired fibrinolysis. The inflammatory disease process, immobilization with prolonged hospital stay, hypoxia due to extensive lung injury and pre-existing comorbidities can contribute to thromboembolic episodes (TE). The observed risk for TE in COVID-19 is high despite anticoagulation, particularly in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. A high level of clinical suspicion, lower threshold for diagnostic imaging and aggressive early and extended thromboprophylaxis is indicated. The available evidence on the optimal strategies to prevent, diagnose, and treat VTE in patients with COVID-19 is heterogenous, but rapidly evolving.

The various protection measures imposed by national and regional legislation were analyzed. Two hundred and eighty-six pharmacists (about 8% of the invited ones) responded to the survey. Ten pharmacists reported a positive result to the serological test. Of the subjects who presented a positive result, three declared that they had not used a hand sanitizer, while two stated that they had not scheduled the cleaning and decontamination of surfaces. Two interviewees had not set up a system of quota restrictions on admissions. In four cases, a certified cleaning company had decontaminated the premises. The results of our study show that during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the most pressing challenge for community pharmacists has been the protection of staff and clients inside the pharmacy; the challenge to be faced in the near future will probably be the management of new responsibilities.","Baratta, Francesca; Visentin, Giulio Mario; Ravetto Enri, Lorenzo; Parente, Marco; Pignata, Irene; Venuti, Francesco; Di Perri, Giovanni; Brusa, Paola",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),96,26

Cruise tourism is increasingly popular, with an estimated 30 million passengers transported on cruise ships worldwide each year. Safeguarding the health of cruise travelers during the entire travel is of ultimate importance for both the industry and global public health. Objective: This study aimed to explore the challenges and opportunities in travel health from the perspective of global health governance. Methods: The global governance framework including problems, values, tools or regulations, and actors related to travel health were used to analyze the issues involved. Results: Up to April 2020, nearly thirty cruise ship voyages reported COVID-19 cases. The Diamond Princess, Grand Princess and Ruby Princess cruise ship had over 1400 total reported COVID-19 cases, and more than 30 deaths. A community with a common future in travel health is the core value of global health governance for travel health. The travel-related international regulations, including the International Health Regulation (IHR [2005]), United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and the International Maritime Organization (IMO) conventions should be further updated to deal with the travel health problems. The roles and responsibilities and the cooperation mechanisms of different actors are not clear in relation to the public health emergencies during the travel. Conclusion: Travel health transcends national borders and involves multilevel actors, thus needs global cooperation and governance. Regulations and legislation at global and country level are required to prevent large-scale humanitarian crisis on travel health. Multilateral coordination, cooperation and collaboration mechanisms between governments, intergovernmental organizations, non-governmental organizations and industry are needed to build a better community of common destiny for travel health.","Zhou, Shuduo; Han, Lu; Liu, Peilong; Zheng, Zhijie",,96,33

This review provides an overview of the underlying immune profile of COVID-19-related CRS as well as laboratory markers for acute diagnosis and chronic follow-up of patients with SARS-CoV-2 and CRS. AREAS COVERED: Innate and acquired immune profiles in COVID-19-CRS, RNA-detection methods for SARS-CoV-2 in the setting of CRS including factors that affect assay performance, serology for SARS-CoV-2 in the setting of CRS, and other biomarkers for COVID-19 will be discussed. EXPERT OPINION: Studies support the implication of CRS in the pathogenesis, clinical severity and outcome of COVID-19 through the production of multiple inflammatory cytokines and chemokines from activated innate and adaptive immune cells. Although these inflammatory molecules, including IL-6, IL-2 R, IL-10, IP-10 and MCP-1, often correlate with disease severity as possible biomarkers, the pathogenic contributions of individual molecules and the therapeutic benefits of targeting them are yet to be demonstrated. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA is the gold standard method for diagnosis of COVID-19 in the context of CRS but assay performance varies and is susceptible to false-negative results even as patients clinically deteriorate due to decreased viral shedding in the setting of CRS. Biomarkers including CRP, ferritin, D-dimer and procalcitonin may provide early clues about progression to CRS and help identify thrombotic and infectious complications of COVID-19.","Azar, Marwan M; Shin, Junghee J; Kang, Insoo; Landry, Marie",Expert Rev Mol Diagn,96,16

This series aims to expose undergraduate and medical students to IR physician perspectives of a typical day. As IR continues to grow as a specialty, it is essential to promote awareness and recruit future generations of physicians to this innovative field [1,2]. Currently, it is difficult for undergraduate and medical students to shadow IRs in hospitals, depending on COVID-19 protocol, so the video series gives students a glimpse at what an IR does. For the series, several residents and attendings were invited to create video content for the IR Education YouTube channel run by the SIR RFS. Materials and Methods: A template and instructions for the video series were provided to the participating physicians. The interventional radiologists were asked to take approximately 5 minutes of video footage consisting of an introduction, their type of practice, their day-to-day schedule, and a tour of their facility. They can add any additional information they would like, such as procedures, devices, why they chose IR, and current lifestyle. Notably, the physicians have the flexibility to make the video unique to their preference. To aid in the video-making process, medical students involved in this project will complete video editing, such as adding music and clip transitions with the footage submissions. We will survey undergraduate and medical students to gauge if the YouTube series sparked interest in the field of IR. Additionally, our survey can identify specific topics or content sought out by viewing students to incorporate those into future videos. Results: We will analyze our survey results to identify if the “Day in the Life of IR” video series kindled attraction to a career in IR. Analysis of video views, likes, and new subscribers to the IR Education YouTube channel will help us identify which videos were most liked and shared to develop more appealing and relevant videos. Conclusions: The “Day in the Life of IR” video series was implemented to foster interest in IR, recruit future IRs, and provide information to medical and undergraduate students who cannot shadow due to the current COVID-19 epidemic. We hope to ignite a passion or curiosity for IR to recruit brilliant minds to this specialty.","Barnard, E.; Dambaeva, A.; Gibney, B.; Tenewitz, C.; Farag, A.; Vatakencherry, G.",Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology,96,16

We aimed to determine whether epidemic growth is globally associated with climate or public health interventions intended to reduce transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). METHODS: We performed a prospective cohort study of all 144 geopolitical areas worldwide (375 609 cases) with at least 10 COVID-19 cases and local transmission by Mar. 20, 2020, excluding China, South Korea, Iran and Italy. Using weighted random-effects regression, we determined the association between epidemic growth (expressed as ratios of rate ratios [RRR] comparing cumulative counts of COVID-19 cases on Mar. 27, 2020, with cumulative counts on Mar. 20, 2020) and latitude, temperature, humidity, school closures, restrictions of mass gatherings, and measures of social distancing during an exposure period 14 days previously (Mar. 7 to 13, 2020). RESULTS: In univariate analyses, there were no associations of epidemic growth with latitude and temperature, but weak negative associations with relative humidity (RRR per 10% 0.91, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.85-0.96) and absolute humidity (RRR per 5 g/m3 0.92, 95% CI 0.85-0.99). Strong associations were found for restrictions of mass gatherings (RRR 0.65, 95% CI 0.53-0.79), school closures (RRR 0.63, 95% CI 0.52-0.78) and measures of social distancing (RRR 0.62, 95% CI 0.45-0.85). In a multivariable model, there was a strong association with the number of implemented public health interventions (p for trend = 0.001), whereas the association with absolute humidity was no longer significant. INTERPRETATION: Epidemic growth of COVID-19 was not associated with latitude and temperature, but may be associated weakly with relative or absolute humidity. Conversely, public health interventions were strongly associated with reduced epidemic growth.","Jüni, Peter; Rothenbühler, Martina; Bobos, Pavlos; Thorpe, Kevin E; da Costa, Bruno R; Fisman, David N; Slutsky, Arthur S; Gesink, Dionne",CMAJ,96,1

Further, the interconnected nature of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis demands an integrated approach and coordinated action, which complicates decision making even more. Identifying the best set of policies and instruments to address COVID-19 challenges, and aligning them with broader social goals will be critically important for sustainable recovery from the pandemic. The key practical challenge facing the policy makers of developing countries is how to prioritize policies to achieve the interconnected goals of managing the health crisis, recovering the economy, and achieving environmental sustainability. We present a framework for identifying and prioritizing policy actions to address the COVID-19 challenges and ensure sustainable recovery. The framework outlines principles and criteria and provides insights into developing shared policy goals, identifying smart strategies, assessing policy compatibility, aligning policy instruments, and factoring sustainability into short and long-term policy decisions. This framework can assist policy makers in linking short and long-term goals, mapping the interactions of different policy options, and assessing anticipated consequences and cross-sectoral implications. This will enable policy makers to prioritize policy choices and allocate limited resources in such a way that they are directed toward actions that generate synergy and co-benefits, have multiplier effects, and achieve interconnected solutions for health, the economy and environment.","Rasul, Golam",Front Public Health,96,16

We investigated the role and underlying mechanism of sulfiredoxin-1 (Srxn1) in AP. Mild AP was induced by intraperitoneal injection of cerulein and severe AP was induced by partial duct ligation with cerulein stimulation or intraperitoneal injection of L-arginine in mice. Acinar cells, neutrophils, and macrophages were isolated. The pancreas was analyzed by histology, immunochemistry staining, and TUNEL assays, and the expression of certain proteins and RNAs, cytokine levels, trypsin activity, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were determined. Srxn1 was inhibited by J14 or silenced by siRNA, and overexpression was introduced by a lentiviral vector. Transcriptomic analysis was used to explore the mechanism of Srxn1-mediated effects. We also evaluated the effect of adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated overexpression of Srxn1 by intraductal administration and the protection of AP. We found that Srxn1 expression was upregulated in mild AP but decreased in severe AP. Inhibition of Srxn1 increased ROS, histological score, the release of trypsin, and inflammatory responses in mice. Inhibition of Srxn1 expression promoted the production of ROS and induced apoptosis, while overexpression of Srxn1 led to the opposite results in acinar cells. Furthermore, inhibition of Srxn1 expression promoted the inflammatory response by accumulating and activating M1 phenotype macrophages and neutrophils in AP. Mechanistically, ROS-induced ER stress and activation of Cathepsin B, which converts trypsinogen to trypsin, were responsible for the Srxn1 inhibition-mediated effects on AP. Importantly, we demonstrated that AAV-mediated overexpression of Srxn1 attenuated AP in mice. Taken together, these results showed that Srxn1 is a protective target for AP by attenuating acinar injury and inflammation through the ROS/ER stress/Cathepsin B axis.","He, Jun; Ma, Miaomiao; Li, Daming; Wang, Kunpeng; Wang, Qiuguo; Li, Qiuguo; He, Hongye; Zhou, Yan; Li, Qinglong; Hou, Xuyang; Yang, Leping",Cell Death Dis,96,16

Herein, we showed that this lineage does not affect the Berlin-Charité protocol but can challenge the available commercial kits directed to the Spike (S) gene. All efforts should be made to continue to monitor SARS-CoV-2 genomes for potential variants that can impair diagnostic testing and lead to false negative results.","Ramírez, Juan D; Muñoz, Marina; Patiño, Luz H; Ballesteros, Nathalia; Paniz-Mondolfi, Alberto",J Med Virol,96,17

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to examine changes in estimated sleep duration in 5 major metropolitan areas before and after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a prospective observational study using estimated sleep duration data obtained from a smartphone app. The data were obtained from regular users of the smartphone app before and after the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic in March 2020. We compared within-subject estimated sleep duration before and during the COVID-19 pandemic using generalized linear mixed models. RESULTS: Among the 2,871,037 observations, 957,022 (33.3%) were from users in London; 549,151 (19.1%) were from users in Los Angeles; 846,527 (29.5%) were from users in New York City; 251,113 (8.7%) were from users in Seoul; and 267,224 (9.3%) were from users in Stockholm. The average age of the users in the sample was 35 years (SE 11 years). Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, people residing in Seoul had the shortest estimated sleep duration (mean 6 hours 28 minutes, SE 11.6 minutes) and those residing in Stockholm had the longest estimated sleep duration (mean 7 hours 34 minutes, SE 9.9 minutes). The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with a 13.7 minute increase in estimated sleep duration when comparing March 2019 and March 2020 (95% CI 13.1-14.3, P<.001) and an increase of 22.3 minutes when comparing April 2019 and April 2020 (95% CI 21.5-23.1, P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: The average estimated sleep duration increased sharply in the months after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. This finding suggests that the implementation of COVID-19 mitigation strategies has provided people worldwide with increased opportunities to sleep, which may enhance the response of the immune system to viral pathogens.","Robbins, Rebecca; Affouf, Mahmoud; Weaver, Matthew D; Czeisler, Mark É; Barger, Laura K; Quan, Stuart F; Czeisler, Charles A",J Med Internet Res,96,26

To understand possible ramifications of these delays, we examined the association between time to operation and pathologic staging and overall survival (OS). STUDY DESIGN: Patients with DCIS or ER+ cT1-2N0 breast cancer treated from 2010 through 2016 were identified in the National Cancer Database. Time to operation was recorded. Factors associated with pathologic upstaging were examined using logistic regression analyses. Cox proportional hazard models were used to analyze OS. Analyses were stratified by disease stage and initial treatment strategy. RESULTS: There were 378,839 patients identified. Among those undergoing primary surgical procedure, time to operation was within 120 days in > 98% in all groups. Among cT1-2N0 patients selected for NET, operations were performed within 120 days in 59.6% of cT1N0 and 30.9% of cT2N0 patients. Increased time to operation was associated with increased odds of pathologic upstaging in DCIS patients (ER+: 60 to 120 days: odds ratio 1.15; 95% CI, 1.08 to 1.22; more than 120 days: odds ratio 1.44; 95% CI, 1.24 to 1.68; ER-: 60 to 120 days: NS; more than 120 days: odds ratio 1.36; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.82; 60 days or less: reference), but not in patients with invasive cancer, irrespective of initial treatment strategy. No difference in OS was seen by time to operation in DCIS or NET patients. CONCLUSIONS: Increased time to operation was associated with a small increase in pathologic upstaging in DCIS patients, but did not impact OS. In patients with cT1-2N0 disease, NET use did not impact stage or OS, supporting the safety of delay strategies in ER+ breast cancer patients during the pandemic.","Minami, Christina A; Kantor, Olga; Weiss, Anna; Nakhlis, Faina; King, Tari A; Mittendorf, Elizabeth A",J Am Coll Surg,96,1

Briefly, recreancy is loss of societal trust that results when institutional actors can no longer be counted on to perform their responsibilities. Our study of mental well-being and recreancy focuses on the role of universities and government regulators within the education sector. We surveyed 600 UK students attending 161 different public higher education providers in October 2020 during a time when many UK students were isolated in their residences and engaged in online learning. We assessed student well-being using the Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (scored 7-35) and found the mean score to be 19.9 [95% confidence interval (CI) 19.6, 20.2]. This level of well-being indicates that a significant proportion of UK students face low levels of mental well-being. Structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis indicates that high recreancy-measured as a low trust in universities and the government-is associated with low levels of mental well-being across the student sample. While these findings are suggestive, they are also important and we suggest that government and university leaders should not only work to increase food and housing security during the Covid-19 pandemic, but also consider how to combat various sector trends that might intensify recreancy.","Defeyter, Margaret Anne; Stretesky, Paul B; Long, Michael A; Furey, Sinéad; Reynolds, Christian; Porteous, Debbie; Dodd, Alyson; Mann, Emily; Kemp, Anna; Fox, James; McAnallen, Andrew; Gonçalves, Lara",Front Public Health,96,16

Also, the infection-induced inflammatory changes are found in patients with disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC). The lack of previous immunity to COVID-19 has caused infection of a large number of patients worldwide and unpredictability regarding the management of the complications that appear in the course of this viral illness. Lungs are the most important target organ of the SARS-COV-2. In COVID-19 patients, acute lung injury leads to respiratory failure. However, multiorgan failure can also occur in these patients. The primary coagulopathy of COVID-19 is marked by a considerable elevation of D-dimer, ferritin, and fibrinogen degradation products. In comparison, abnormalities in platelet count, prothrombin time, and partial thromboplastin time are partly uncommon in initial presentations. Inflammatory biomarkers including CRP, LDH, and IL-6 are significantly elevated in the early stages of the disease. In this regard, inflammation-associated biomarkers and coagulation test screening, including the assessment of IL-6, CRP, LDH, D-dimer, platelet count, PT&PTT time, ferritin, and fibrinogen levels are suggested for detecting infection by this virus.

The utility of telepsychiatry is relevant now more than ever as the world endures the COVID-19 global pandemic. This paper describes the prior state and the changes that the COVID-19 outbreak brought to telepsychiatry in a selected group of Arab countries of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. Patients and Methods: We invited twelve early-career psychiatrists from different Arab nations to share information related to telepsychiatry in their respective countries before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The information was collected using a semi-structured guide. This was complemented by a search for relevant articles in five search engines using terms such as ""COVID-19,"" ""telepsychiatry,"" and ""Arab world"". Results: Before the pandemic, digital mental health services were provided in several Arab countries, mainly through hotlines and messaging services. The COVID-19 pandemic has marked a major shift in digital psychiatric services in the Arab MENA world, through the transformation of many clinics and some hospitals into digital mental health systems. Many non-governmental organizations also started remote initiatives for psychological support and psychiatric counseling. Three main barriers of patient-related, healthcare-related, and system-related hurdles of using telepsychiatry emanated from the analysis. Conclusion: The use of digital mental health services varies between different Arab countries. Even though some nations have laws that regulate the provision of such services, most struggle with multifactorial barriers. As affordable and attainable solutions cannot only rely on training and recruiting more psychiatrists, telepsychiatry would help meet the exceeding demands in the Arab world, particularly after the COVID-19 outbreak.","El Hayek, Samer; Nofal, Marwa; Abdelrahman, Doaa; Adra, Ali; Al Harthi, Mansour; Al Shamli, Siham; AlNuaimi, Nawaf; Bensid, Lynda; Cheaito, Mohamad Ali; Emberish, Alkhansa Mahdi; Larnaout, Amine; Radwan, Ahmed; Slaih, Mohammad; Kobeissy, Firas; Bizri, Maya",Neuropsychiatr Dis Treat,96,1

Allergy is accompanied by a systemic inflammatory response and some epidemiological studies have reported a positive association between a history of allergy/asthma and dementia. To investigate whether chronic airway allergy influences the inflammatory status in the brain, AD-like pathology, and behaviour in relation to AD, we induced chronic airway allergy in triple transgenic AD (3xTgAD) and wildtype (WT) mice by repeated exposure to ovalbumin (OVA) as allergen. Behavioural tests relevant for hippocampus-dependent behaviour were performed. We found that allergy significantly increased the brain levels of immunoglobulin (Ig) G, IgE. In 3xTgAD mice, allergy increased the levels of decay accelerating factor and decreased the phosphorylation of p38. In contrast, allergy increased the levels of interleukin (IL)-1ß and complement component 1q (C1q) in WT mice. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid analysis confirmed eosinophilia in both genotypes, but the basal levels of eosinophils were lower in 3xTgAD mice. In summary, allergy induced predominantly anti-inflammatory effects in 3xTgAD mice, and pro-inflammatory effects in WT mice, thus being another potential factor to be considered when studying AD pathogenesis.","Sarlus, Heela; Codita, Alina; Wang, Xiuzhe; Cedazo-Minguez, Angel; Schultzberg, Marianne; Oprica, Mircea",Neuroscience,96,1

This is particularly concerning for medical students underrepresented in medicine (UIM) due to the potential of widening existing disparities in applicant and workforce composition. To proactively address this, we created a Radiation Oncology Intensive Shadowing Experience (RISE) to expose UIM students to the field of radiation oncology. Methods and Materials: Key stakeholders within the residency program, including both UIM faculty and residents with experience in health disparities and medical education designed a one-week virtual Radiation Oncology Intensive Shadowing Experience (RISE) intended for fourth year UIM students recruited through established national organizations serving UIM medical students. A one-week disease specific curriculum was developed using four components: 1) foundational exposure to radiation oncology, 2) didactic teaching, 3) mentorship opportunities, and 4) a capstone experience. Mentorship was continuously weaved through the experience by attendings, peer resident mentors and a UIM resident panel to optimize exposure. Results: RISE was successfully initiated at two academic medical centers with twelve UIM students enrolled through August. Anonymized pre- and post- clerkship surveys were developed for students, residents and faculty involved in RISE to evaluate participants' satisfaction, resident and attending time burden, and perceptions of program effectiveness. Conclusions: We created a unique virtual RO shadowing experience for UIM students to address a critical gap in exposure to radiation oncology, heightened by the COVID pandemic, with the goal of improving diversity, equity and inclusion in our field.","Franco, Idalid; Oladeru, Oluwadamilola T; Saraf, Anurag; Liu, Kevin X; Milligan, Michael; Zietman, Anthony; Nguyen, Paul L; Hirsch, Ariel E; Jimenez, Rachel",,96,16

The pandemic crisis presents some unique challenges for patients currently being treated with deep brain stimulation (DBS). Movement disorder (Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, dystonia), neuropsychiatric disorder (obsessive compulsive disorder, Tourette syndrome, depression), and epilepsy patients can develop varying degrees of symptom worsening from interruption of therapy due to neurostimulator battery reaching end of life, device malfunction or infection. Urgent intervention to maintain or restore stimulation may be required for patients with Parkinson's disease who can develop a rare but potentially life-threatening complication known as DBS-withdrawal syndrome. Similarly, patients with generalized dystonia can develop status dystonicus, patients with obsessive compulsive disorder can become suicidal, and epilepsy patients can experience potentially life-threatening worsening of seizures as a result of therapy cessation. DBS system infection can require urgent, and rarely emergent surgery. Elective interventions including new implantations and initial programming should be postponed. For patients with existing DBS systems, the battery status and electrical integrity interrogation can now be performed using patient programmers, and employed through telemedicine visits or by phone consultations. The decision for replacement of the implantable pulse generator to prevent interruption of DBS therapy should be made on a case-by-case basis taking into consideration battery status and a patient's tolerance to potential therapy disruption. Scheduling of the procedures, however, depends heavily on the hospital system regulations and on triage procedures with respect to safety and resource utilization during the health crisis.","Miocinovic, Svjetlana; Ostrem, Jill L; Okun, Michael S; Bullinger, Katie L; Riva-Posse, Patricio; Gross, Robert E; Buetefisch, Cathrin M",J Parkinsons Dis,96,1

DESIGN: On-line cross-sectional survey. SETTING: Data were collected between 20th and 22nd April 2020. PARTICIPANTS: 6149 participants living in the UK aged 18 years or over. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Perceived immunity to COVID-19, self-reported adherence to social distancing measures (going out for essential shopping, nonessential shopping, and meeting up with friends/family; total out-of-home activity), worry about COVID-19 and perceived risk of COVID-19 to oneself and people in the UK. Knowledge that cough and high temperature / fever are the main symptoms of COVID-19. We used logistic regression analyses and one-way ANOVAs to investigate associations between believing you had had COVID-19 and binary and continuous outcomes respectively. RESULTS: In this sample, 1493 people (24.3%) thought they had had COVID-19 but only 245 (4.0%) reported having received a positive test result. Reported test results were often incongruent with participants' belief that they had had COVID-19. People who believed that they had had COVID-19 were: more likely to agree that they had some immunity to COVID-19; less likely to report adhering to lockdown measures; less worried about COVID-19; and less likely to know that cough and high temperature / fever are two of the most common symptoms of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: At the time of data collection, the percentage of people in the UK who thought they had already had COVID-19 was about twice the estimated infection rate.

However, the climate of the pandemic has also seen anti-vaccination sentiments flourish. AIMS: To determine the intent to accept COVID-19 vaccination among healthcare workers at a London Hospital Trust and examine variation in uptake between demographic groups. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey open to staff working at the trust. Staff rated on a five-point scale the likelihood of them accepting COVID-19 vaccination. RESULTS: We received 514 responses, representing 16% of the workforce. About 59% of staff intended to seek vaccination, 24% to reject and 17% were unsure. There was significantly reduced intended uptake in females, younger age groups, healthcare assistants, nurses, staff of black ethnic backgrounds and those who rejected influenza vaccination. Safety was the dominant concern. CONCLUSIONS: Our study finds COVID-19 vaccinate hesitancy is prevalent among healthcare workers at a London Hospital Trust. It is particularly concerning that hesitancy was highest amongst groups most exposed to COVID-19 and most at risk of severe disease. Reasons behind disparities in uptake must be addressed to protect staff and prevent deepening inequalities within the healthcare workforce.","Abuown, A; Ellis, T; Miller, J; Davidson, R; Kachwala, Q; Medeiros, M; Mejia, K; Manoraj, S; Sidhu, M; Whittington, A M; Pattani, S",Occup. med,96,1

It is indispensable to glucose homeostasis, immune robustness, bone health, cardiovascular health, and neural functions. The main way that estrogen acts in the cells is through estrogen receptors (ERs). The presence of specific estrogen receptors is required for estrogen to have its characteristic ubiquitous action in almost all tissues. Estrogen receptor alpha (ER&#945;) and estrogen receptor beta (ERß) are the major isoforms of estrogen that are highly specific in humans and enable selective hormonal actions in different tissues. This article reviews some of the observed estrogen actions and effects in different tissues and cells through these specific receptors. This ubiquitous, almost ordinary hormone may reveal itself as a significant factor that helped us to better understand the complexity of the human immune system response against respiratory infections, including the COVID-19, and especially in the current state of this painful pandemic.","Millas, Ieda; Duarte Barros, Mirna",Anat Rec (Hoboken),96,16

Multiple countries and cities are implementing different mitigation strategies to reduce their transmission (e.g., physical distancing, stay-at-home orders, avoiding large gatherings). Such interventions have been related to positive and negative health externalities. Currently, the selection of mitigation strategies has not been systematically considering a long-term vision for urban health equity. This review presents evidence and a framework linking COVID-19 mitigation strategies, the built environment, and transport to health determinants and outcomes. In addition, the paper provides a set of urban interventions aimed at supporting COVID-19 mitigation strategies and promoting a long-term health equity vision. RECENT FINDINGS: COVID-19 mitigation strategies, in addition to helping reduce disease transmission, have also decreased urban road transport, resulting in indirect benefits on air quality, traffic noise, and traffic incidents. On the other hand, the same mitigation strategies have had negative impacts on physical activity, mental health, home isolation, and access to transport options, among others. COVID-19 mitigation strategies are an opportunity to test and implement built environment and transport interventions aimed to maximize health equity and minimize health risks. National and local authorities should systematically integrate a long-term urban health equity vision when designing and implementing COVID-19 mitigation strategies. COVID-19 offers an opportunity to rethink the built environment and transport infrastructure with the aim to support short-term mitigation strategies and reduce long-term urban health inequities.","Rojas-Rueda, David; Morales-Zamora, Emily",Curr Environ Health Rep,96,20

To determine if social interactions and financial resources moderate the relationship between work loss and health. Methods Participants were Australians aged 18 + years that were employed in paid work prior to the COVID-19 pandemic who responded to an online or telephone survey from 27th March to 12th June 2020 as part of a prospective longitudinal cohort study. Outcome measures include Kessler-6 score > 18 indicating high psychological distress, and Short Form 12 (SF-12) mental health or physical health component score < = 45 indicating poor mental or physical health. Results The cohort consisted of 2,603 respondents, including groups who had lost their job (N = 541), were not working but remained employed (N = 613), were working less (N = 660), and whose work was unaffected (N = 789). Three groups experiencing work loss had greater odds of high psychological distress (AOR = 2.22-3.66), poor mental (AOR = 1.78-2.27) and physical health (AOR = 2.10-2.12) than the unaffected work group. Poor mental health was more common than poor physical health. The odds of high psychological distress (AOR = 5.43-8.36), poor mental (AOR = 1.92-4.53) and physical health (AOR = 1.93-3.90) were increased in those reporting fewer social interactions or less financial resources. Conclusion Losing work during the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with mental and physical health problems, and this relationship is moderated by social interactions and financial resources. Responses that increase financial security and enhance social connections may alleviate the health impacts of work loss.

However, the availability of these drugs is limited by their high cost. Infliximab was the first biologic to be approved for inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). After its patent expired other manufactures developed biosimilar versions, among which CT-P13, and licensed them thorough an expedite process. AREAS COVERED: The aim of this review is to summarize the available evidence on CT-P13 use in IBD, with particular interest in the phase II trials of a subcutaneous version of CT-P13. EXPERT OPINION: Biosimilars, such as CT-P13, are an important resource for health-care systems. Although CT-P13 approval in IBD was based on extrapolation, subsequent studies confirmed its clinical equivalence to originator infliximab. A new subcutaneous formulation of CT-P13 showed promising results in phase I and II trials in both CD and UC. Clinical efficacy and safety were comparable and interestingly serum drug doses appeared to be more stable than conventional intravenous CT-P13. If these preliminary results will be confirmed, the first sub-cutaneous version of infliximab could soon be available for IBD.","Parigi, Tommaso Lorenzo; D039,; Amico, Ferdinando; Peyrin-Biroulet, Laurent; Danese, Silvio",Expert Opin Biol Ther,96,29

We explore logistical challenges related to U.S. OPV administration in 2020, review the literature related to nonspecific effects of OPV to induce innate immunity, and model the health and economic implications of the proposal. The costs of reintroducing a single OPV dose to 331 million Americans would exceed $4.4 billion. Giving a dose of bivalent OPV to the entire U.S. population would lead to an expected 40 identifiable cases of vaccine-associated paralytic polio, with young Americans at the highest risk. Reintroducing any OPV use in the U.S. poses a risk of restarting transmission of OPV-related viruses and could lead to new infections in immunocompromised individuals with B-cell related primary immunodeficiencies that could lead to later cases of paralysis. Due to the lack of a currently licensed OPV in the U.S., the decision to administer OPV to Americans for nonspecific immunological effects would require purchasing limited global OPV supplies that could impact polio eradication efforts. Health economic modeling suggests no role for reintroducing OPV into the U.S. with respect to responding to COVID-19. Countries that currently use OPV experience fundamentally different risks, costs, and benefits than the U.S. Successful global polio eradication will depend on sufficient OPV supplies, achieving and maintaining high OPV coverage in OPV-using countries, and effective global OPV cessation and containment in all countries, including the U.S.","Thompson, Kimberly M; Kalkowska, Dominika A; Badizadegan, Kamran",Risk Anal,96,16

The antivaccine movement uses Facebook to promote messages on the alleged dangers and consequences of vaccinating, leading to a reluctance to immunize against preventable communicable diseases. OBJECTIVE: We would like to know more about the messages these websites are sharing via social media that can influence readers and consumers. What messages is the public receiving on Facebook about immunization? What content (news articles, testimonials, videos, scientific studies) is being promoted? METHODS: We proposed using a social media audit tool and 3 categorical lists to capture information on websites and posts, respectively. The keywords ""vaccine,"" ""vaccine truth,"" and ""anti-vax"" were entered in the Facebook search bar. A Facebook page was examined if it had between 2500 and 150,000 likes. Data about beliefs, calls to action, and testimonials were recorded from posts and listed under the categories Myths, Truths, and Consequences. Website data were entered in a social media audit template. RESULTS: Users' posts reflected fear and vaccine hesitancy resulting from the alleged dangers of immunization featured on the website links. Vaccines were blamed for afflictions such as autism, cancer, and infertility. Mothers shared testimonies on alleged consequences their children suffered due to immunization, which have influenced other parents to not vaccinate their children. Users denied the current measles outbreaks in the United States to be true, retaliating against the government in protests for fabricating news. CONCLUSIONS: Some Facebook messages encourage prevailing myths about the safety and consequences of vaccines and likely contribute to parents' vaccine hesitancy. Deeply concerning is the mistrust social media has the potential to cast upon the relationship between health care providers and the public. A grasp of common misconceptions can help support health care provider practice.","Dhaliwal, Dhamanpreet; Mannion, Cynthia",JMIR Public Health Surveill,96,9

This study investigates the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients in Zhejiang Province who did or did not have a history of Wuhan exposure. METHODS: We collected data from medical records of confirmed COVID-19 patients in Zhejiang Province from Jan. 17 to Feb. 7, 2020 and analyzed epidemiological, clinical, and treatment data of those with and without recorded recent exposure in Wuhan. RESULTS: Patients in the control group were older than those in the exposure group ((48.19±16.13) years vs. (43.47±13.12) years, P<0.001), and more were over 65 years old (15.95% control vs. 5.60% exposure, P<0.001). The rate of clustered onset was also significantly higher in the control group than in the exposure group (31.39% vs. 18.66%, P<0.001). The symptom of a sore throat in patients in the exposure group was significantly higher than that in the control group (17.30% vs. 10.89%, P=0.01); however, headache in the exposure group was significantly lower than that in the control group (6.87% vs. 12.15%, P=0.015). More patients in the exposure group had a significantly lower level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) than those in the control group. There was no significant difference in any degree of COVID-19 including mild, severe, and critical between the two groups.

Because COVID-19 is extremely transmissible and can progress to a severe form of respiratory failure, the potential to overwhelm available critical care resources is high and critical care management of COVID-19 patients has been thrust into the spotlight. COVID-19 arrived in the United States in January and, as anticipated, has dramatically increased the usage of critical care resources. Three of the hardest-hit cities have been Seattle, New York City, and Chicago with a combined total of over 14,000 cases as of March 23, 2020.In this special article, we describe initial clinical impressions of critical care of COVID-19 in these areas, with attention to clinical presentation, laboratory values, organ system effects, treatment strategies, and resource management.

We apply shocks to a group of stocks in a part of the market, and we quantify the effects in terms of average losses on another part of the market using a sparse probabilistic elliptical model for the multivariate return distribution of the whole market. Sparsity is introduced with an $L_0$-norm regularization, which forces to zero some elements of the inverse covariance according to a dependency structure inferred from an information filtering network. Our study concerns the FTSE 100 and 250 markets and analyzes impact and response to shocks both applied to and received from individual stocks and group of stocks. We observe that the shock pattern is related to the structure of the network associated with the sparse structure of the inverse covariance of stock returns. Central sectors appear more likely to be affected by shocks, and stocks with a large level of underlying diversification have a larger impact on the rest of the market when experiencing shocks. By analyzing the system during times of crisis and comparative market calmness, we observe changes in the shock patterns with a convergent behavior in times of crisis.","Seabrook, Isobel; Caccioli, Fabio; Aste, Tomaso",,96,21

The emerging data from different countries indicate that intimate partner violence (IPV) has intensified since the COVID-19 outbreak. The main purpose of the current study is to find out whether there is any difference in the incidence of IPV during and before the COVID-19 pandemic quarantine and whether any sociodemographical factors are related to the incidence of IPV against pregnant women during quarantine. A cross-sectional, correlational design was in this study. The snowball sampling technique was adopted to select the participants, which produced a nonrepresentative sample of 215 pregnant women. The participants completed the Arabic version of the World Health Organization's Domestic Violence Questionnaire Screening Tool (DVQST). We found that women were exposed to different types of IPV before and during the quarantine. The most prevalent form of IPV was control and humiliation (n 172, 80%) and the least prevalent was sexual violence ((n 33, 15.3%), (n 24, 11.2%), respectively). However, there were statistically significant lower DVQST scores during the COVID-19 quarantine than before the quarantine. All types of IPV are significantly correlated with each other and with relationship problems (marital conflict, verbal fighting, understanding each other). While the findings are not generalizable to the general population of pregnant women in Jordan because the sample consisted only of women of high socioeconomic status due to the use of a nonprobability sampling technique, national campaigns should be developed and implemented in order to reduce IPV and change community behaviors and attitudes toward violence against women. It is also recommended that policymakers develop plans to help pregnant women during quarantine by, for example, training care providers on how to access vulnerable women.","Abujilban, Sanaa; Mrayan, Lina; Hamaideh, Shaher; Obeisat, Salwa; Damra, Jalal",J Interpers Violence,96,16

On the one hand, we believe that the distinguished contributions in disease containment efforts by healthcare professionals indicated that our medical education system has achieved its intended outcomes and is socially accountable. On the other hand, we have also identified three major issues that need to be addressed from an educational standpoint: insufficient emphasis on public health emergency preparedness; unsophisticated mechanisms for interdisciplinary cooperation; and inadequate guidance in medical ethics.

Several studies attempt to infer NPI effectiveness with cross-country, data-driven modelling, by linking from NPI implementation dates to the observed timeline of cases and deaths in a country. These models make many assumptions. Previous work sometimes tests the sensitivity to variations in explicit epidemiological model parameters, but rarely analyses the sensitivity to the assumptions that are made by the choice the of model structure (structural sensitivity analysis). Such analysis would ensure that the inferences made are consistent under plausible alternative assumptions. Without it, NPI effectiveness estimates cannot be used to guide policy. We investigate four model structures similar to a recent state-of-the-art Bayesian hierarchical model. We find that the models differ considerably in the robustness of their NPI effectiveness estimates to changes in epidemiological parameters and the data. Considering only the models that have good robustness, we find that results and policy-relevant conclusions are remarkably consistent across the structurally different models. We further investigate the common assumptions that the effect of an NPI is independent of the country, the time, and other active NPIs. We mathematically show how to interpret effectiveness estimates when these assumptions are violated.","Sharma, Mrinank; Mindermann, Soren; Brauner, Jan Markus; Leech, Gavin; Stephenson, Anna B.; Gavenvciak, Tom'avs; Kulveit, Jan; Teh, Yee Whye; Chindelevitch, Leonid; Gal, Yarin",,96,16

To understand better the role of vitamin D deficiency in the disease course of COVID-19, we undertook a retrospective case-control study in the North West of England (NWE). OBJECTIVE: To examine whether hospitalisation with COVID-19 is more prevalent in individuals with lower vitamin D levels. METHODS: The study included individuals with results of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) between 1 st April 2020 and 29th January 2021. Patients were recruited from two districts in NWE. The last 25(OH)D level in the previous 12 months was categorised as 'deficient' if less than 25 nmol/L and 'insufficient' if 25-50 nmol/L. RESULTS: 80,670 participants were entered into the study. Of these, 1,808 were admitted to hospital with COVID-19, of whom 670 died. In a primary cohort, median serum 25(OH)D in participants who were not hospitalised with COVID-19 was 50.0 [interquartile range, IQR 34.0-66.7] nmol/L versus 35.0 [IQR 21.0-57.0] nmol/L in those admitted with COVID-19 (p <0.005). There were similar findings in a validation cohort (median serum 25(OH)D 47.1 [IQR 31.8-64.7] nmol/L in non-hospitalised versus 33.0 [IQR 19.4-54.1] nmol/L in hospitalised patients). Age-, sex- and seasonal variation-adjusted odds ratios for hospital admission were 2.3-2.4 times higher among participants with serum 25(OH)D <50 nmol/L, compared to those with normal serum 25(OH)D levels, without any excess mortality risk. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D deficiency is associated with higher risk of COVID-19 hospitalisation. Widespread measurement of serum 25(OH)D and treating any unmasked insufficiency or deficiency through testing may reduce this risk.","Jude, Edward B; Ling, Stephanie F; Allcock, Rebecca; Yeap, Beverly X Y; Pappachan, Joseph M",J. clin. endocrinol. metab,96,26

The approaches range considerably from total (China) to selective surveillance, which, however, seems overly excessive towards privacy of certain social groups, exacerbating social stratification and business disruptions in East Asia. The article argues that selective surveillance models vary across the region from voluntary selective (Japan) to compulsory selective surveillance (Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, South Korea) and differ in terms of privacy and related rights. Yet, the increased risks of data misuse and leakages in all the East Asian states and territories need effective legal mechanisms for privacy and data protection that pay sufficient attention to public scrutiny and independent regulators.","Sherstoboeva Elena---Pavlenko, Valentina",Journal of Digital Media &amp; Policy,96,8

In particular, L-type Ca2+ channels, usually located on motoneuron dendrites, play a primary role in amplification of synaptic inputs. However, recent experimental findings on L-type Ca2+ channel behaviors challenge some fundamental assumptions that have been used in interpreting experimental and computational modeling data. Thus, the objectives of this study were to incorporate recent experimental data into an updated, high-fidelity computational model in order to explain apparent inconsistencies, and to better elucidate the spatial distributions, expression patterns, and functional roles of L-type Ca2+ and SKL channels. Specifically, the updated model incorporated asymmetric channel activation/deactivation kinetics, depolarization-dependent facilitation, randomness in channel gating, and coactivation of SKL channels. Our simulation results suggest that L-type Ca2+ and SKL channels co-localize primarily on distal dendrites of motoneurons, in a punctate expression. Also, punctate expression, as opposed to a homogenous expression, provides high synaptic current amplification, limits bistability and firing rates, and robustly regulates the Ca2+ persistent inward current, thereby reducing risk of excitotoxicity. The hysteresis and bistability observed experimentally in current/voltage and frequency/current relationships result from the L-type Ca2+ channels' distal location and intrinsic warm-up. Accordingly, our results indicate that punctate expression of L-type Ca2+ and SKL channels is a potent mechanism for regulating excitability, which would provide a strong neuroprotective effect. Our results could provide broader insights into the functional significance of warm-up and punctate expression of ion channels to regulation of cell excitability.","Mousa, Mohamed H; Elbasiouny, Sherif M",J. neurophysiol,96,6

Aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs) are responsible for detoxification of these aldehydes protecting the cell. Due to the physiological relevance of these enzymes, it is important to design strategies to modulate their activity. It was previously reported that omeprazole activation of ALDH1A1 protected Escherichia coli cells overexpressing this enzyme, from oxidative stress generated by H2 O2 . In this work, omeprazole cell protection potential was evaluated in eukaryotic cells. AS-30D cell or hepatocyte suspensions were subjected to a treatment with omeprazole and exposure to light (that is required to activate omeprazole in the active site of ALDH) and then exposed to H2 O2 . Cells showed viability similar to control cells, total activity of ALDH was preserved, while cell levels of lipid aldehydes and oxidative stress markers were maintained low. Cell protection by omeprazole was avoided by inhibition of ALDHs with disulfiram, revealing the key role of these enzymes in the protection. Additionally, omeprazole also preserved ALDH2 (mitochondrial isoform) activity, diminishing lipid aldehyde levels and oxidative stress in this organelle, protecting mitochondrial respiration and transmembrane potential formation capacity, from the stress generated by H2 O2 . These results highlight the important role of ALDHs as part of the antioxidant system of the cell, since if the activity of these enzymes decreases under stress conditions, the viability of the cell is compromised.","Calleja, Luis Francisco; Yoval-Sánchez, Belem; Hernández-Esquivel, Luz; Gallardo-Pérez, Juan Carlos; Sosa-Garrocho, Marcela; Marín-Hernández, Álvaro; Jasso-Chávez, Ricardo; Macías-Silva, Marina; Salud Rodríguez-Zavala, José",FEBS j,96,7

Cross-sectional data indicate that anxiety and depression levels are greater during the pandemic, yet no known prospective studies have tested this assertion. Further, individuals with elevated trait anxiety prior to a global pandemic may theoretically be more apt to experience greater pandemic-related anxiety and/or impairment. The current study tested whether anxiety and depression increased from the month before the state's Stay-At-Home order to the period of the Stay-At-Home order among 120 young adults in Louisiana, a state with especially high rates of COVID-19 related infections and deaths. We also tested whether pre-pandemic social anxiety was related to greater pandemic related anxiety, depression, and COVID-related worry and impairment. Depression but not anxiety increased during the Stay-At-Home order. Further, pre-pandemic trait anxiety, social anxiety, and depression were statistically significant predictors of anxiety and depression during the Stay-At-Home order, although only social anxiety was robustly related to COVID-related worry and impairment. Emotional distress increased during the COVID-19 pandemic Stay-At-Home order and this is especially the case among individuals with pre-pandemic elevations in trait anxiety (especially social anxiety) and depression.","Buckner, Julia D; Abarno, Cristina N; Lewis, Elizabeth M; Zvolensky, Michael J; Garey, Lorra",Psychiatry Res,96,17

The pneumococcal vaccination rate among the elderly in China was only 3.7% in 2019, it grew rapidly during the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to investigate the psychological and demographic-economic factors related to the uptake behavior of pneumococcal vaccination among the Chinese elderly by using an integrated model based on the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT), and knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP). The theoretical model was tested via structural equation modeling (SEM) with data collected from 516 Chinese older adults aged 60 years and older. Our results suggested that knowledge, performance expectancy, effort expectancy, attitude, and trust had a significant correlation with behavioral intention; behavioral intention and trust had a positive correlation with the uptake behavior, gender, and and education level and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exerted significant moderating effects. To increase the coverage of pneumococcal vaccination among the elderly, it is necessary to provide effective health education by authoritative experts, thereby enhancing their knowledge and positive attitude towardthe vaccination.","Zhou, Min; Zhan, Jiaying; Kong, Nan; Campy, Kathryn S; Chen, Yan",Psychol Health Med,96,5

Improved rapid diagnosis and antimicrobial resistance determination, such as by whole genome sequencing, are required. Our aim was to develop a simple, low-cost method of preparing DNA for sequencing direct from MTB positive clinical samples (without culture). Simultaneous sputum liquefaction, bacteria heat-inactivation (99°C/30min) and enrichment for Mycobacteria DNA was achieved using an equal volume of thermo-protection buffer (4M KCl, 0.05M HEPES buffer pH7.5, 0.1% DTT). The buffer emulated intracellular conditions found in hyperthermophiles, thus protecting DNA from rapid thermo-degradation, which renders it a poor template for sequencing. Initial validation experiments employed Mycobacteria DNA, either extracted or intracellular. Next, mock clinical samples (infection-negative human sputum spiked 0-105 BCG cells/ml) underwent liquefaction in thermo-protection buffer and heat-inactivation. DNA was extracted and sequenced. Human DNA degraded faster than Mycobacteria DNA, resulting in target enrichment. Four replicate experiments achieved MTB detection at 101 BCG cells/ml, with 31-59 MTB complex reads. Maximal genome coverage (>97% at 5x-depth) occurred at 104 BCG cells/ml; >91% coverage (1x depth) at 103 BCG cells/ml. Final validation employed MTB positive clinical samples (n=20), revealing initial sample volumes &#8805;1ml typically yielded higher mean depth of MTB genome coverage, the overall range 0.55-81.02. A mean depth of 3 gave >96% one-fold TB genome coverage (in 15/20 clinical samples). A mean depth of 15 achieved >99% five-fold genome coverage (in 9/20 clinical samples).

To do so, we needed to identify these patients and develop a protocol to keep them out of the hospital (to limit risk of infection and conserve medical resources), and do so without in-person visits. So we used our peer-reviewed software, Diabetes Reporting, to identify 87 patients whose glucose management indicator (GMI) scores were over 9%. The GMI is a method for estimating the laboratory A1C using the patient's actual blood glucose measurements over the past 90 days. A GMI (or A1C) over 9% indicates a heightened risk of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and, possibly, a slightly higher risk of severe hypoglycemia (SH), the two most common acute complications leading patients with T1D to be hospitalized. We contacted these 87 at-risk patients and enrolled them in a quality improvement project. This project consisted of additional online meetings with their doctors as well as weekly reports generated by Diabetes Reporting for three months, between March 28, 2020 and June 28, 2020. We hypothesized that this heightened communication would reduce the incidence of DKA and SH among the participants by reducing their GMI. As a comparison group, we used data from the T1D Exchange, which showed that, among patients with an A1C over 9%, 6.7% were hospitalized for DKA and 7% experienced SH leading to loss of consciousness in a three-month period. This led us to predict 6 incidences of DKA and 6 incidences of SH among our 87 participants during the three-month period. Instead, we saw 2 incidences of DKA and 1 incidence of SH. Moreover, the mean GMI of our participants dropped from 9.91% to 9.25%, a clinically-significant .66% improvement, which supports the conclusion that our protocol helped avoid acute complications among a cohort of at-risk patients with T1D by improving glycemic control during a time when we were limited to largely online care. This telemedicine protocol merits further research for its potential to improve and lower costs of care for patients with T1D, particularly for those at higher risk for acute complications.","Zeller, William P; DeGraff, Rachel; Zeller, William",J Clin Transl Endocrinol Case Rep,96,16

Treatment protocols generally include dietary restriction of sugar, as well as drugs aiming at a reduction of blood glucose, mainly by activating the insulin system or supplementing insulin. This established approach does not take into account the outstanding physiological role of glucose as a key molecule in metabolism. Glucose is crucial to meet the high energy demand of the brain, which depends on it as an exclusive nutrient. Insulin independent glucose transporters GLUT1 import glucose into the brain. Reduction of blood glucose, as in current treatment concepts, may lead to energy deficiency in the brain and consecutively to worsening of - possibly already impaired - neurocognitive function. Reduced cell membrane fluidity of the vascular endothelium of the bloodbrain-barrier (BBB) - due to malnutrition and/or aging - is considered a major factor in pathogenesis of the cerebral metabolic syndrome, which is a key step in neurodegeneration.

However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study tested the potential role of Rab small GTPase 5a (Rab5a) in the process. We tested mRNA and protein expression of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1ß and IL-6) in THP-1 macrophages by qPCR and ELISA assays, respectively. In the primary colonic epithelial cells, Cdt treatment induced CdtB-Rab5a-cellugyrin association. Rab5a silencing, by target small hairpin (sh) RNAs, largely inhibited CdtB-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis in colon epithelial cells. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated Rab5a knockout also attenuated CdtB-induced colon epithelial cell death. Conversely, forced overexpression of Rab5a intensified CdtB-induced cytotoxicity. In THP-1 human macrophages, Rab5a shRNA or knockout significantly inhibited CdtB-induced mRNA expression and production of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1ß and IL-6). Rab5a depletion inhibited activation of nuclear factor-&#954;B (NF-&#954;B) and JNK signaling in CdtB-treated THP-1 macrophages. Rab5a appears essential for CdtB-induced cytotoxicity in colonic epithelial cells and proinflammatory responses in THP-1 macrophages.","Chen, Ming-Xian; Chen, Yu; Fu, Rui; Mao, Guo-Qun; Liu, Sai-Yue; Shen, Tang-Biao",Infect. immun,96,7

Patients may develop a myriad of long-term multiorgan impairments, affecting the respiratory, cardiac, neurological, digestive and musculoskeletal systems. Skeletal muscle dysfunction of respiratory and limb muscles, commonly referred to as intensive care unit acquired weakness, occurs in approximately 40% of all patients admitted to intensive care. The impact on mobility and return to activities of daily living is severe. Furthermore, many patients experience ongoing symptoms of fatigue, weakness and shortness of breath, in what is being described as ""long COVID"". Neuromuscular electrical stimulation is a technique in which small electrical impulses are applied to skeletal muscle to cause contractions when voluntary muscle contraction is difficult or impossible. Neuromuscular electrical stimulation can prevent muscle atrophy, improve muscle strength and function, maintain blood flow and reduce oedema. This review examines the evidence, current guidelines, and proposed benefits of using neuromuscular electrical stimulation with patients admitted to the intensive care unit. Practical recommendations for using electrical muscle stimulation in patients with COVID-19 are provided, and suggestions for further research are proposed. Evidence suggests NMES may play a role in the weaning of patients from ventilators and can be continued in the post-acute and longer-term phases of recovery. As such, NMES may be a suitable treatment modality to implement within rehabilitation pathways for COVID-19, with consideration of the practical and safety issues highlighted within this review.","Burgess, Louise C; Venugopalan, Lalitha; Badger, James; Street, Tamsyn; Alon, Gad; Jarvis, Jonathan C; Wainwright, Thomas W; Everington, Tamara; Taylor, Paul; Swain, Ian D",J Rehabil Med,96,28

In response to anti-Blackness, a multigenerational and multiracial movement of people is rising and demanding justice for Black lives. Using testimonio research and Liberation Psychology as a theoretical framework, the authors describe their current understanding of what it means to practice a more responsible resistance to racist power structures as non-Black Latinas in the field of psychology. Braun and Clarke's (2016) thematic analysis (TA) was used to search for patterns of meaning within the authors' testimonios. Results revealed four themes: (a) to ""hold the line"" means to struggle for Black liberation, (b) confront anti-Blackness and colonial mentality in the self and community, (c) challenge anti-Blackness within the field of psychology, and (d) collective struggle. The third theme was divided into two subthemes: (a) tear down and (b) center Black lives. The testimonios emphasize that practicing allyship involves being a dissenter who questions and challenges colonial mentality and anti-Blackness, who fights for the abolition of racist policies and power systems, and who moves beyond the hegemonic values that exist in the field of psychology.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) has also been reported to occur with this virus. A cluster of cases of euglycemic DKA (euDKA) was identified in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus using sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) who developed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: The cases were identified by the authors while providing clinical care, and details were collected. Results: Five cases of euDKA, presenting with glucose levels <300 mg/dL, were identified over the course of 2 months by the endocrinology consult service. All patients had a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus with no known history of DKA. All were taking SGLT2is. Oral antihyperglycemic medications were stopped for all patients on admission. All received intravenous insulin infusion to treat DKA before being transitioned to a subcutaneous insulin regimen. SGLT2i use was discontinued for all patients who were discharged. Conclusion: EuDKA has been seen in the setting of acute illness in patients using SGLT2is, but this cluster of cases suggests that there is a specific association with SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition to the known risk of euDKA with SGLT2i use, coronavirus disease 2019-specific mechanisms may include a direct toxic effect of the virus on the pancreatic islets, an accelerated inflammatory response promoting ketosis, and the diuretic effect of SGLT2i in conjunction with anorexia and vomiting. It is crucial to counsel patients to stop SGLT2is when sick, especially if SARS-CoV-2 infection is suspected.","Vitale, Rebecca J; Valtis, Yannis K; McDonnell, Marie E; Palermo, Nadine E; Fisher, Naomi D L",,96,16

Our aim was to report our experience in patients with IGM managed mainly with conservative methods, such as antibiotics, drainages and corticosteroids. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Pathology database from 2008 to 2018 was reviewed retrospectively. Demographics and symptoms were documented from patient charts. Follow-up information was obtained from clinical reviews, and severity and duration of symptoms were documented. All data were transferred to Excel file and the parameters were compared. RESULTS: All 154 patients were women. Mean age was 35.9 years. Empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic, abscess drainage and steroid treatments were seen to be successful in most of the cases (95.4%). In patients with limited regression (2.5%) or persistant lesions (1.9%), a second cycle was employed with a total regression rate of 100%. Recurrence was seen one or two times in 23 (14.9%) and 2 (1.2%) patients in a mean follow-up period of 5.3 years. The average time of recurrence was 2.5 years (range, 9-74 months).

METHODS: Cross-sectional study within a large prospective, multicenter cohort of (ex-)breast cancer patients, i.e., UMBRELLA. All participants enrolled in the UMBRELLA cohort between October 2013 and April 2020 were sent a COVID-19-specific survey, including the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) questionnaire. RESULTS: In total, 1051 (66.0%) participants completed the survey. During COVID-19, 284 (27.0%) participants reported clinically relevant increased levels of anxiety and/or depression, i.e., total HADS score &#8805; 12. Participants with anxiety and/or depression reported statistically significant higher barriers to contact their general practitioner (47.5% vs. 25.0%, resp.) and breast cancer physicians (26.8% vs. 11.2%, resp.) compared to participants without these symptoms. In addition, a higher proportion of participants with anxiety and/or depression reported that their current treatment or (after)care was affected by COVID-19 compared to those without these symptoms (32.7% vs. 20.5%, resp.). Factors independently associated with symptoms of anxiety and/or depression during COVID-19 were pre-existent anxiety (OR 6.1, 95% CI 4.1-9.2) or depression (OR 6.0, 95% CI 3.5-10.2). CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, (ex-)breast cancer patients with symptoms of anxiety and/or depression experience higher barriers to contact health care providers. Also, they more often report that their health care was affected by COVID-19. Risk factors for anxiety and/or depression during COVID-19 are pre-existent symptoms of anxiety or depression.

Current risk stratification among these patients relies on personal experience and extrapolation from patients with acquired heart disease. We aimed to provide an expert view on risk stratification while awaiting results from observational studies. METHODS: This study was an initiative of the EPOCH (European Collaboration for Prospective Outcome Research in Congenital Heart disease). Among nine European countries (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland), 24 experts from 23 tertiary ACHD centres participated in the survey. ACHD experts were asked to identify ACHD-specific COVID-19 risk factors from a list of potential outcome predictors and to estimate the risk of adverse COVID-19 outcomes in seven commonly seen patient scenarios. RESULTS: 82% of participants did not consider all ACHD patients at risk of COVID-19 related complications. There was a consensus on pulmonary arterial hypertension, Fontan physiology and cyanotic heart disease as risk factors for adverse outcomes. Among different ACHD scenarios, a patient with Eisenmenger syndrome was considered to be at the highest risk. There was a marked variability in risk estimation among the other potential outcome predictors and ACHD scenarios. CONCLUSIONS: Pulmonary arterial hypertension, Fontan palliation and cyanotic heart disease were widely considered as risk factors for poor outcome in COVID-19. However, there was a marked disparity in risk estimation for other clinical scenarios. We are in urgent need of outcome studies in ACHD suffering from COVID-19.","Ruperti-Repilado, Francisco Javier; Tobler, Daniel; Greutmann, Matthias; Bouchardy, Judith; Ladouceur, Magalie; Dos-Subira, Laura; Gallego, Pastora; Gabriel, Harald; Bouma, Berto; Schwerzmann, Markus",,96,4

The training is based on the method of video analysis, involving simulated patients, making online implementation extremely challenging. AIM: The study aims to present our experiences with the online training and to analyse the students' evaluations. METHOD: We used the free version of Zoom for small groups of five students, a trainer and a simulated patient. All students participated in a situation that we recorded. The viewing of the recordings was followed by group discussion. Then, the students evaluated the course using an online questionnaire. We used descriptive statistics and content analysis. RESULTS: 74.4% of the students (n = 64) completed the questionnaire. 78.1-100% of them gave a good (4) or excellent (5) evaluation for the questions. The highest average score (4.95 ± 0.21) was given to the professionalism of the trainers, the lowest was given to the choice of topic of the theoretical part (4.06 ± 1.02). The majority of the students were satisfied with the course, they would be happy to attend it again; however, in-person learning still seems to be the preferred option. CONCLUSION: The online practice was a success. In many ways, it proved to be an adequate replacement for the traditional form. The students evaluated the training similarly to those of previous years. The lack of personal contact is a limiting factor, thus, online practice should not be seen as an alternative to personal communication trainings; however, as an independent form of training, it can make a significant contribution to effective, modern education.

Recently, early clinical data reported the feasibility of low doses of radiation therapy (RT) in the treatment of ARDS in patients with severe COVID-19. However, the involved mechanisms remained unknown. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Here, we used airways-instilled lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and influenza virus (H1N1) as murine models of pneumonia, and toll-like receptor (TLR)-3 stimulation in human lung macrophages. RESULTS: Low doses of RT (0.5-1 Gray) decreased LPS-induced pneumonia, and increased the percentage of nerve- and airway-associated macrophages producing interleukin (IL) 10. During H1N1 viral infection, we observed decreased lung tissue damage and immune cell infiltration in irradiated animals. Low doses of RT increased IL-10 production by infiltrating immune cells into the lung. Irradiation of TLR-3 ligand-stimulated human lung macrophages ex vivo increased IL-10 secretion and decreased interferon Î³ production in the culture supernatant. The percentage of human lung macrophages producing IL-6 was also decreased. CONCLUSIONS: Our data highlight a mechanism by which low doses of RT regulate lung inflammation and skew lung macrophages toward an anti-inflammatory profile. These data provide a preclinical mechanistic support to clinical trials evaluating low doses of RT, such as COVID-19-induced ARDS.","Meziani, Lydia; Robert, Charlotte; Classe, Marion; Da Costa, Bruno; Mondini, Michele; Clémenson, Céline; Alfaro, Alexia; Mordant, Pierre; Ammari, Samy; Le Goffic, Ronan; Deutsch, Eric",Int. j. radiat. oncol. biol. phys,96,24

Here, we evaluated whether a mobile technology-based personalized epilepsy SM education intervention, PAUSE to Learn Your Epilepsy (PAUSE), improves SM measures such as self-efficacy, epilepsy SM behaviors, epilepsy outcome expectations, quality of life (QOL), and personal impact of epilepsy in adults with epilepsy. METHODS: Recruitment for the PAUSE study occurred from October 2015 to March 2019. Ninety-one PWE were educated using an Internet-enabled computer tablet application that downloads custom, patient-specific educational programs from Epilepsy.com. Validated self-reported questionnaires were used for outcome measures. Participants were assessed at baseline (T0), the first follow-up at completion of the PWE-paced 8-12-week SM education intervention (T1), and the second follow-up at least 3â¯months after the first follow-up (T2). Multiple linear regression was used to assess within-subject significant changes in outcome measures between these time points. RESULTS: The study population was diverse and included individuals with a wide variety of SM educational needs and abilities. The median time for the first follow-up assessment (T1) was approximately 4â¯months following the baseline (T0) and 8â¯months following baseline for the second follow-up assessment (T2). Participants showed significant improvement in all SM behaviors, self-efficacy, outcome expectancy, QOL, and personal impact of epilepsy measures from T0 to T1. Participants who scored lower at baseline tended to show greater improvement at T1. Similarly, results showed that participant improvement was sustained in the majority of SM measures from T1 to T2. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that a mobile technology-based personalized SM intervention is feasible to implement. The results provide evidence that epilepsy SM behavior and practices, QOL, outcome expectation for epilepsy treatment and management, self-efficacy, and outcome expectation and impact of epilepsy significantly improve following a personalized SM education intervention. This underscores a greater need for a pragmatic trial to test the effectiveness of personalized SM education, such as PAUSE to Learn Your Epilepsy, in broader settings specifically for the unique needs of the hard-to-reach and hard-to-treat population of PWE.","Pandey, Dilip K; Dasgupta, Raktima; Levy, Jessica; Wang, Heng; Serafini, Anna; Habibi, Mitra; Song, Woojin; Shafer, Patricia O; Loeb, Jeffrey A",Epilepsy Behav,96,16

The pandemic has starkly revealed the need for a better public health infrastructure and a health system with incentives for population health and prevention of disease as well as outstanding personalized curative health. It has also provided opportunities for innovations in health care and has inspired courageous actions of residents, who have responded to the needs of their patients despite risk to themselves. In this Invited Commentary, the author shares lessons he learned from 3 earlier disasters and discusses needed changes in medical education, health care, and health policy that the COVID-19 pandemic has revealed. He encourages health professions educators to use the experiences of this pandemic to reexamine the current curricular emphasis on the bioscientific model of health and to broaden the educational approach to incorporate the behavioral, social, and environmental factors that influence health. Surveillance for disease, investment in disease and injury prevention, and disaster planning should be basic elements of health professions education. Incorporating innovations such as telemedicine, used under duress during the pandemic, could alter educational and clinical approaches to create something better for students, residents, and patients. He explains that journals such as Academic Medicine can provide rapid, curated, expert advice that can be an important counterweight to the misinformation that circulates during disasters. Such journals can also inform their readers about new training in skills needed to mitigate the ongoing effects of the disaster and prepare the workforce for future disasters.","Sklar, David P",Acad Med,96,33

Treatment and Prevention,14.53345,7.92228,2020,"BACKGROUND: Fahr's syndrome (or Fahr's disease) is a rare, neurological disorder characterized by bilateral calcification in the cerebellum, thalamus, basal ganglia, and cerebral cortex as a result of calcium and phosphorus metabolism disorder. The patients may be asymptomatic and clinical symptoms represent a wide range of neurologic manifestations and nonspecific neuropsychiatric disorders. We report an unusual case of Fahr's syndrome which was asymptomatic and incidentally diagnosed by generalized tonic-clonic seizure in a patient with SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pneumonia. CASE PRESENTATION: The patient was a 68-year-old female and admitted to our emergency department suffering from cough and fatigue. After thorax computed tomography (CT) and SARS-CoV-2 PCR test, she was diagnosed as COVID-19 pneumonia. In the intensive care unit, the patient had a tonic-clonic convulsion starting from the left arm and spreading to the whole body. Fahr's syndrome was diagnosed after a cranial CT scan and blood metabolic panel test. CONCLUSIONS: As a result of the clinical, radiological, and biochemical evaluations, the patient was diagnosed incidentally as Fahr's syndrome associated with hypoparathyroidism. Seizures could be induced by hydroxychloroquine that was in the COVID-19 treatment or the inflammation caused by COVID-19 pneumonia. The association between the mortality of COVID-19 pneumonia and Fahr's syndrome is unknown which needs further research.","Demir, Gürkan; Balaban, Onur; Tekeci, Muhammet Halit; Issi, Zeynep; Erdem, Ali Fuat",Neurol Sci,96,1

Even though most people infected experience mild to moderate respiratory symptoms and recover with supportive care, certain vulnerable hosts develop severe clinical deterioration. While several drugs are currently being investigated in clinical trials, there are currently no approved treatments or vaccines for COVID-19 and hence there is an unmet need to explore additional therapeutic options. At least three inflammatory disorders or syndromes associated with immune dysfunction have been described in the context of cellular therapy. Specifically, Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS), Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (IRIS), and Secondary Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH) all have clinical and laboratory characteristics in common with COVID19 and associated therapies that could be worth testing in the context of clinical trials. Here we discuss these diseases, their management, and potential applications of these treatment in the context of COVID-19.

The inclusion criteria were cases of consultation in the emergency department for gastrointestinal diseases that required hospitalization, from January to April, from 2015 to 2020. The pediatric population (under age 12) was excluded. RESULTS: A total of 2,457 cases of cases was included. The number of emergency hospitalizations for gastrointestinal cases decreased during the first four months of 2020: 108, 112, 82, and 77, respectively. Comparing April of 2020 with previous years, there was a lower than expected number of cases during the social distancing period (P=0.002). CONCLUSION: This study reports a pronounced decrease in consultations for severe gastrointestinal emergencies during the pandemic. Governments and society should be aware that health crises do not halt the natural occurrence of noninfectious diseases; otherwise, an increase in mortality from these morbidities may arise.","Leite, Carine; Trindade, Eduardo Neubarth; Grillo, Leonardo Wagner; Trindade, Manoel Roberto Maciel",Rev.

Background: Since partial oxygen pressure decreases as altitude increases, environmental hypoxia could worsen Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) patient's hypoxemia. We compared COVID-19 mortality at different altitudes. Methods: Retrospective analysis of population-level data on COVID-19 deaths was conducted in the United States (1,016 counties) and Mexico (567 municipalities). Mixed-model Poisson regression analysis of the association between altitude and COVID-19 mortality was conducted using individual-level data from 40,168 Mexican subjects with COVID-19, adjusting for multiple covariates. Results: Between January 20 and April 13, 2020, mortality rates were higher in U.S. counties located at &#8805;2,000 m elevation versus those located <1,500 m (12.3 vs. 3.2 per 100,000; p < 0.001). In Mexico, between March 13 and May 13, 2020, mortality rates were higher in municipalities located at &#8805;2,000 m versus those located <1,500 m (5.3 vs. 3.9 per 100,000; p < 0.001). Among Mexican subjects younger than 65 years, the risk of death was 36% higher in those living at &#8805;2,000 m versus those living at <1,500 m (adjusted incidence rate ratio [IRR]: 1.36; confidence interval [95% CI], 1.05-1.78; p = 0.022). Among Mexican men, the risk of death was 31% higher at &#8805;2,000 m versus that at <1,500 m (adjusted IRR: 1.31; 95% CI, 1.03-1.66; p = 0.025). No association between altitude and COVID-19 mortality was found among Mexican women or among Mexican subjects 65 years of age and older. Conclusions: Altitude is associated with COVID-19 mortality in men younger than 65 years.","Woolcott, Orison O; Bergman, Richard N",,96,16

METHODS: In this retrospective archive study, pediatric patients who were followed up in the hospital with a possible or definitive diagnosis of COVID-19 and who had chest CT at presentation were included. CT scan images of the patients were reinterpreted by a pediatric radiologist and compared with their RT-PCR test results. RESULTS: Of the total of 89 patients, 33 had negative and 56 had positive RT-PCR tests. The presence of pulmonary lesions and consolidation was statistically significantly higher in the RT-PCR negative group than in the RT-PCR positive group (p = 0.037 and 0.001, respectively). Lobe involvement of 0%-25% was higher in the RT-PCR positive group (p = 0.001), and lobe involvements of 25%-50% and 50%-75% were significantly higher in the RT-PCR negative group (p = 0.001 and 0.005, respectively). Central and perihilar involvement was found to be statistically significant in the RT-PCR negative group (p = 0.008 and 0.005, respectively). CONCLUSION: Chest CT findings may provide some clues in predicting RT-PCR positivity in children with a probable diagnosis of COVID-19. Lobe involvement percentage of up to 25% is a finding in favor of patients with positive RT-PCR test, whereas 25%-75% lobe involvement, central and perihilar involvement, and consolidation can be interpreted in favor of patients with negative RT-PCR test.","Bagci, Zafer; Keçeli, Avni Merter",Pediatr Pulmonol,96,8

The reference standard for diagnosis is a positive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test, but results are not immediate and sensibility is variable. AIM: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of lung ultrasound compared to chest X-ray for COVID-19 pneumonia. DESIGN AND SETTING: A retrospective analysis of symptomatic patients admitted into one primary care centre in Spain between March and September 2020. METHOD: Patients' chest X-rays and lung ultrasounds were categorized as normal or pathologic. RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 infection. Pathologic lung ultrasound images were further categorized as showing either local or diffuse interstitial disease. McNemar and Fisher tests were used to compare diagnostic accuracy. RESULTS: Most of the 212 patients presented fever at admission, either as a standalone symptom (37.74% of patients) or together with others (72.17% of patients). The positive predictive value of the lung ultrasound was 90% for the diffuse interstitial pattern and 46.92% for local pattern. The lung ultrasound had a significantly higher sensitivity (82.75%) (p < 0.001), but lower specificity (71%) than the chest X-ray (54.02% and 86%, respectively) (p = 0.008) for identifying interstitial lung disease. Moreover, sensitivity of the lung ultrasound for severe interstitial disease was 100%, and was significantly higher than the chest X-ray (58.33%) (p = 0.002). CONCLUSION: The lung ultrasound is more accurate than the chest X-ray for identifying patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and it is especially useful for those presenting diffuse interstitial disease.","Martínez Redondo, Javier; Comas Rodríguez, Carles; Pujol Salud, Jesús; Crespo Pons, Montserrat; García Serrano, Cristina; Ortega Bravo, Marta; Palacín Peruga, Jose María",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),96,5

To predict patient risk for critical COVID-19 based on status at admission using machine-learning models. Retrospective study based on a database of tertiary medical center with designated departments for patients with COVID-19. Patients with severe COVID-19 at admission, based on low oxygen saturation, low partial arterial oxygen pressure, were excluded. The primary outcome was risk for critical disease, defined as mechanical ventilation, multi-organ failure, admission to the ICU, and/or death. Three different machine-learning models were used to predict patient deterioration and compared to currently suggested predictors and to the APACHEII risk-prediction score. Among 6995 patients evaluated, 162 were hospitalized with non-severe COVID-19, of them, 25 (15.4%) patients deteriorated to critical COVID-19. Machine-learning models outperformed the all other parameters, including the APACHE II score (ROC AUC of 0.92 vs. 0.79, respectively), reaching 88.0% sensitivity, 92.7% specificity and 92.0% accuracy in predicting critical COVID-19. The most contributory variables to the models were APACHE II score, white blood cell count, time from symptoms to admission, oxygen saturation and blood lymphocytes count. Machine-learning models demonstrated high efficacy in predicting critical COVID-19 compared to the most efficacious tools available. Hence, artificial intelligence may be applied for accurate risk prediction of patients with COVID-19, to optimize patients triage and in-hospital allocation, better prioritization of medical resources and improved overall management of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Assaf, Dan; Gutman, Ya039; ara,; Neuman, Yair; Segal, Gad; Amit, Sharon; Gefen-Halevi, Shiraz; Shilo, Noya; Epstein, Avi; Mor-Cohen, Ronit; Biber, Asaf; Rahav, Galia; Levy, Itzchak; Tirosh, Amit",Intern Emerg Med,96,27

AIMS: Identifying and understanding COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy may aid future public health messaging. This study, in which we planned to study the determinants of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, aims to reveal the relationship between ""intolerance of uncertainty,"" ""belief in conspiracy theories,"" and ""COVID-19 phobia"" with vaccine hesitancy. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study conducted during a COVID-19 outbreak. Participants were reached via various social media platforms and e-mailing lists for convenience. Data were collected with an online survey using SurveyMonkey application. ""Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale (IUS-12),"" ""Conspiracy Mentality Scale (CMS),"" and ""COVID-19 Phobia Scale"" were applied to 488 participants. Statistical significance level was considered p < 0.05. RESULTS: Four hundred eighty-eight people between the ages of 18 and 65 participated. Twenty-one participants were excluded from the analysis due to random marking and unreasonable filling times (< 10 min). In this way, analyzes were made with 467 people. We found a positive correlation between the belief in conspiracy theories and vaccine hesitancy (p < 0.05). And also found that individuals with low fear of COVID-19 would hesitate about vaccination (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Vaccine hesitancy is an important public health problem, and it puts public health at risk, especially during the epidemic period we live in. Therefore, it is important to understand the psychological factors involved in vaccine hesitancy. It would be useful to look for ways to spread accurate information about the vaccine in a healthier way in this case.","Nazli, Serif Bora; Yigman, Fatih; Sevindik, Muhammet; Deniz Özturan, Deniz",Ir. j. med. sci,96,29

It is now well known that COVID-19 cases may result in mild symptoms leading to patient recovery. However, severity of infection, fatality rates, and treatment responses across different countries, age groups, and demographic groups suggest that the nature of infection is diverse, and a timely investigation of the same is needed for evolving sound treatment and preventive strategies. This paper reports an the analysis of age distribution patterns in six groups of Indian COVID-19 patient populations based on their likely geographical origin of infection viz. the United Kingdom, North America, the European Union, the Middle East, and Asian countries. It was observed that patient groups stratified in this way had a distinct age profile and that some of these groups e.g. patient groups from Asia, the European Union, and the United Kingdom formed a different cluster than those from North America, the Middle East, and other regions. Patient age profiles of a population were found to be highly predictive of the group they belong to, and there are indications of their distinct recovery and fatality rates across gender. Altogether this study provides a scalable framework to estimate the source of infection in a new population of COVID-19 patients with unknown origin. It is also concluded that greater public availability of age and other demographic profile details of patients may be helpful in gaining robust insights into COVID-19 infection origins.

The role and outcome of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in the management of COVID-19 is currently unclear. Eight COVID-19 patients have received ECMO support in Shanghai with seven with venovenous (VV) ECMO support and one veno arterial (VA) ECMO during cardiopulmonary resuscitation. As of March 25, 2020, four patients died (50% mortality), three patients (37.5%) were successfully weaned off ECMO after 22, 40, and 47 days support, respectively, but remain on mechanical ventilation. One patient is still on VV ECMO with mechanical ventilation. The partial pressure of oxygen/fractional of inspired oxygen ratio before ECMO initiation was between 54 and 76, and all were well below 100. The duration of mechanical ventilation before ECMO ranged from 4 to 21 days. Except the one emergent VA ECMO during cardiopulmonary resuscitation, other patients were on ECMO support for between 18 and 47 days. In conclusion, ensuring effective, timely, and safe ECMO support in COVID-19 is key to improving clinical outcomes. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support might be an integral part of the critical care provided for COVID-19 patients in centers with advanced ECMO expertise.","Li, Xin; Guo, Zhen; Li, Bailing; Zhang, Xiaolin; Tian, Rui; Wu, Wei; Zhang, Zhongwei; Lu, Yunfei; Chen, Nan; Clifford, Sean P; Huang, Jiapeng",ASAIO J,96,1

A 3% drop in oxygen saturation (SpO2) has been suggested as cause for concern in COVID-19 (2). Field walking tests are often used in respiratory disease to assess desaturation. However these tests can be impractical to perform as an inpatient due to space, equipment and technical skill requirements. The aim of this project was to use a simple sit-to-stand test to evaluate exercise-induced oxygen desaturation to inform home oxygen prescription. Methods: Patients were invited to perform a 1 minute sit-to stand test (1minSTS). Tests were performed at the bedside, around the time of hospital discharge, by the inpatient therapy team at a large teaching hospital (Leicester, UK). All but 2 patients were normoxive at rest (87 and 89%). SpO2 was recorded before, during and after each test. A standard height chair and stopwatch were required. Results: 64 patients performed the STS test. 7 COPD (1 existing oxygen prescription). 72% male, 42% white British, 28% Indian, 13% Asian, 17% other. Mean (Standard Deviation: SD) age 59.2 (14.7) years, BMI 29.1 (5.7), length of stay 13.8 (13.7 days). Median (Inter Quartile Range) Medical Research Council Dyspnoea Scale 2 (1-4), Clinical Frailty Scale 2 (2-3). During admission, 7 patients were ventilated.

There was a change of -3.1% (p=0.000).32% of patients desaturated by &gt;3% and 30% were discharged with oxygen.Conclusion: This quick and simple to perform sit-to-stand test identified statistically (and possibly clinically) relevant oxygen desaturation following exercise, in 30% of patients being discharged from hospital with COVID-19. This is important to inform oxygen prescription and when considering patients returning to or starting exercise/physical activity.","Houchen-Wolloff, L.; Daynes, E.; Gerlis, C.; Chaplin, E.; Gardiner, N.; Singh, S.

In the majority of patients, infection with COVID-19 may be asymptomatic or may cause only mild symptoms. However, in some patients, there can also be immunological problems, such as macrophage activation syndrome (CSS) that results in cytokine storm syndrome (CSS) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Comprehension of host-microbe communications is the critical aspect in the advancement of new therapeutics against infectious illnesses. Endogenous animal lectins, a class of proteins, may perceive non-self glycans found on microorganisms. Serum mannose-binding lectin (sMBL), as a part of the innate immune framework, recognizes a wide range of microbial microorganisms and activates complement cascade via an antibody-independent pathway. Although the molecular basis for the intensity of SARS-CoV-2 infection is not generally understood, scientific literature indicates that COVID-19 is correlated with unregulated activation of the complement in terms of disease severity. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), inflammation, and immune paralysis contribute to unregulated complement activation. Pre-existing genetic defects in MBL and their association with complement play a major role in immune response dysregulation caused by SARS-CoV-2. In order to generate anti-complement-based therapies in Covid-19, an understanding of sMBL in immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and complement is therefore essential. This review highlights the role of endogenous sMBL and complement activation during SARS-CoV-2 infection and their therapeutic management by various agents, mainly plant lectins, since antiviral mannose-binding plant lectins (pMBLs) offer potential applications in the prevention and control of viral infections.","Gupta, Anita; Gupta, G S",Mol Cell Biochem,96,1

We describe an interdisciplinary initiative that integrates clinical research, with image diagnostics and the use of new technologies such as artificial intelligence and radiomics with the aim of clarifying some of SARS-CoV-2 open questions. The whole initiative addresses 3 main points: 1) collection of standardize data including images, clinical data and analytics; 2) COVID-19 screening for its early diagnosis at primary care centers; 3) define radiomic signatures of COVID-19 evolution and associated pathologies for the early treatment of complications. In particular, in this paper we present a general overview of the project, the experimental design and first results of X-ray COVID-19 detection using a classic approach based on HoG and feature selection. Our experiments include a comparison to some recent methods for COVID-19 screening in X-Ray and an exploratory analysis of the feasibility of X-Ray COVID-19 screening. Results show that classic approaches can outperform deep-learning methods in this experimental setting, indicate the feasibility of early COVID-19 screening and that non-COVID infiltration is the group of patients most similar to COVID-19 in terms of radiological description of X-ray. Therefore, an efficient COVID-19 screening should be complemented with other clinical data to better discriminate these cases.","Gil, D.; D'iaz-Chito, K.; S'anchez, C.; Hern'andez-Sabat'e, A.",,96,0

Clinical, biological and radiological data were collected, as well as treatments and outcomes. An unfavorable outcome was defined as death or transfer to intensive care unit. We compared the characteristics and outcomes between patients with and without antibiotics using propensity score matching. FINDINGS: Among the 222 patients included, 174 (78%) were on antibiotics. The univariate analysis showed that patients with antibiotics were significantly older, frailer and with a more severe presentation at admission. An unfavorable outcome was more frequent in patients with antibiotic therapy (HR = 2.94, CI95%: 1.07-8.11; p = 0.04). In multivariate analysis and on propensity score, antibiotic therapy was not significantly associated with outcome (HR = 1.612, CI95%: 0.562-4.629, p = 0.37).

In this paper, we address this challenge by giving priority to COVID-19 IoT devices over consumer IoT devices. We propose a two-dimensional Markov chain for modelling the IoT network including COVID-19 IoT devices, then we derive the performance metrics. Our numerical results show a significant improvement in the performance of COVID-19 IoT network in terms of throughput and average delay. Our approach provides a reliable and fast wireless connection of COVID-19 IoT devices to the gateway. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Bellouch, A.; Boujnoui, A.; Zaaloul, A.; Haqiq, A.",Adv.

To assess the incidence of osteoporosis in patients with HBV-associated cirrhosis and relevant mechanisms. Methods: A total of 80 hospitalized patients with HBV-associated cirrhosis and 80 healthy controls were enrolled. The levels of serum osteocalcin, total procollagen type 1 amino-terminal propeptide, ß-C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (ß-CTX), and 25-hydroxy vitamin D3 (25(OH)D3) was evaluated in the cirrhosis group. Results: The BMDs of the lumbar spine (P<0.001) and hip joints (P=0.015) in the cirrhosis group were significantly lower than those in the controls. The incidence of osteoporosis in the cirrhosis group was significantly higher than that in the control group (P<0.001). Compared to the patients of the Child-Pugh grade A and B, the BMD of lumbar spine and 25(OH)D3 was significantly decreased in patients of grade C, while ß-CTX was elevated. Patients in the cirrhosis group faced a higher risk of osteoporosis as compared to the controls(P<0.001). Conclusions: Enhanced bone resorption accounted for increased risk of osteoporosis in severe cirrhosis. Thus, HBV-associated cirrhosis was a risk factor for osteoporosis.","Zhang, Yijin; Gao, Xuesong; Liu, Ting; Gao, Ping; Li, Hongjie; Liu, Nan; Gao, Lili; Wan, Gang; Zhang, Yaonan; Duan, Xuefei",Afr Health Sci,96,29

This review characterizes clinical symptoms, laboratory, and imaging findings, as well as therapies provided to confirmed pediatric cases of COVID-19. Methods: Adhering to PRISMA guidelines, we searched four medical databases (PubMed, LitCovid, Scopus, WHO COVID-19 database) between December 1, 2019 to May 14, 2020 using the keywords ""novel coronavirus"", ""COVID-19"" or ""SARS-CoV-2"". We included published or in press peer-reviewed cross-sectional, case series, and case reports providing clinical signs, imaging findings, and/or laboratory results of pediatric patients who were positive for COVID-19. Risk of bias was appraised through the quality assessment tool published by the National Institutes of Health. PROSPERO registration # CRD42020182261. Findings: We identified 131 studies across 26 countries comprising 7780 pediatric patients. Although fever (59·1%) and cough (55·9%) were the most frequent symptoms 19·3% of children were asymptomatic. Patchy lesions (21·0%) and ground-glass opacities (32·9%) depicted lung radiograph and computed tomography findings, respectively. Immunocompromised children or those with respiratory/cardiac disease comprised the largest subset of COVID-19 children with underlying medical conditions (152 of 233 individuals). Coinfections were observed in 5.6% of children and abnormal laboratory markers included serum D-dimer, procalcitonin, creatine kinase, and interleukin-6. Seven deaths were reported (0·09%) and 11 children (0·14%) met inclusion for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. Interpretation: This review provides evidence that children diagnosed with COVID-19 have an overall excellent prognosis. Future longitudinal studies are needed to confirm our findings and better understand which patients are at increased risk for developing severe inflammation and multiorgan failure. Funding: Parker B.

METHODS: We conducted a monocentric retrospective cohort study of COVID-19 patients hospitalized in Paris area. An unfavourable outcome was defined as the need for artificial ventilation and/or death. Characteristics at admission were analysed to identify factors predictive of unfavourable outcome using multivariable Cox proportional hazard models. Based on the results, a nomogram to predict 14-day probability of poor outcome was proposed. RESULTS: Between March 15th and April 14th, 2020, 279 COVID-19 patients were hospitalized after a median of 7 days after the first symptoms. Among them, 88 (31.5%) patients had an unfavourable outcome: 48 were admitted to the ICU for artificial ventilation, and 40 patients died without being admitted to ICU. Multivariable analyses retained age, overweight, polypnoea, fever, high C-reactive protein, elevated us troponin-I, and lymphopenia as risk factors of an unfavourable outcome. A nomogram was established with sufficient discriminatory power (C-index 0.75), and proper consistence between the prediction and the observation. CONCLUSION: We identified seven easily available prognostic factors and proposed a simple nomogram for early detection of patients at risk of aggravation, in order to optimize clinical care and initiate specific therapies. KEY MESSAGES Since novel coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, a minority of patients develops severe respiratory distress syndrome, leading to death despite intensive care. Tools to identify patients at risk in European populations are lacking. In our series, age, respiratory rate, overweight, temperature, C-reactive protein, troponin and lymphocyte counts were risk factors of an unfavourable outcome in hospitalized adult patients. We propose an easy-to-use nomogram to predict unfavourable outcome for hospitalized adult patients to optimize clinical care and initiate specific therapies.","Nguyen, Yann; Corre, Félix; Honsel, Vasco; Curac, Sonja; Zarrouk, Virginie; Burtz, Catherine Paugam; Weiss, Emmanuel; Moyer, Jean-Denis; Gauss, Tobias; Grégory, Jules; Bert, Frédéric; Trichet, Catherine; Peoc039,; h, Katell; Vilgrain, Valérie; Rebours, Vinciane; Fantin, Bruno; Galy, Adrien",Ann Med,96,24

This pattern of infection is quite distinct from the acute/resolving nature of other human pathogenic respiratory viruses, such as influenza A virus and respiratory syncytial virus. Prolonged shedding of SARS-CoV-2 furthermore occurs irrespective of disease severity or development of virus-neutralizing antibodies. SARS-CoV-2 possesses an intensely structured RNA genome, an attribute shared with other human and veterinary coronaviruses and with other mammalian RNA viruses such as hepatitis C virus. These are capable of long-term persistence, possibly through poorly understood RNA structure-mediated effects on innate and adaptive host immune responses. The assumption that resolution of COVID-19 and the appearance of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies represents virus clearance and protection from reinfection, implicit for example in the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model used for epidemic prediction, should be rigorously re-evaluated.","Simmonds, Peter; Williams, Sarah; Harvala, Heli",,96,24

For example, it currently does not give due consideration to Indigenous groups and cultures, such as those living in rural and remote areas of Canada. Once such people are given due consideration, then several important points emerge, which have so far gone unnoticed or under-emphasized in the debate. This article focuses on two of those points: (a) Some vulnerable people who are currently being ignored in the debate may not desire to use gene editing, even if it is safe, effective and affordable, and they will have compelling reasons for making this decision; and (b) even if such people do decide to use the technology, the gene editing enterprise itself is unlikely to do much good for them (and may even be harmful to them), as it alarmingly misses the point regarding the underlying contributing causes of the most pressing problems that those people are facing. Therefore, the promise of the gene editing enterprise is a hollow one for some groups of vulnerable people.

AIM: Delineation of individual strategies of the members of the Society for Pediatric Rheumatology (GKJR) in cases of COVID-19. METHODS: In May 2020 all GKJR members were invited to take part in an online survey. Opinion data regarding an approach using disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARD) in cases of COVID-19 as well as the readiness to use new therapeutic agents in patients in different stages of the disease were collected. RESULTS: A total of 71 respondents (27.3% of all contacted pediatric rheumatologists) took part in the survey. Of these 28.2% had treated patients with COVID-19. Over 95% of the respondents did not support a preventive adaptation of the anti-rheumatic treatment during the SARS-CoV­2 pandemic. In the case of outpatients under immunosuppression with proven COVID-19 more than 50% of the respondents would refrain from administering intravenous high-dose steroids, cyclophosphamide, anti-CD20 antibodies as well as BAFF, CTLA­4 and TNF-alpha blockades. Conversely, >70% of the respondents would continue the treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), oral steroids, mycophenolate, IL­1 blockade and immunoglobulins (Ig). In the case of inpatients 74.6% of respondents would consider targeted COVID-19 treatment. In stable patients with oxygen treatment (stage I) HCQ (18.3%), azithromycin (16.9%) and Ig (9.9%) were most frequently used. In cases of early signs (stage II) or a manifest cytokine storm (stage III) anakinra (40.8% for stage II and 46.5% for stage III), tocilizumab (26.8% and 40.8%, respectively), steroids (25.4% and 33.8%, respectively) and remdesivir (29.6% and 38.0%, respectively) were most frequently used. The need for a personalized approach based on the current clinical situation was emphasized by many respondents. CONCLUSION: The currently low prevalence of COVID-19 in Germany limits the general clinical experience. Therefore, the presented results have to be interpreted with caution and mostly as hypothetical treatment considerations. It is to be expected that there will always be a limited amount of evidence on pediatric COVID-19; therefore, a continuous and critical exchange of expert opinions on the treatment strategies is important.","Janda, A; Schuetz, C; Heeg, M; Minden, K; Hedrich, C M; Kallinich, T; Hinze, C; Schulz, A; Speth, F",Z Rheumatol,96,26

The COVID-19 International Student Well-being Study (C19 ISWS) is a cross-sectional multicountry study that collected data on higher-education students during the COVID-19 outbreak in the spring of 2020. The dataset allows description of: (1) living conditions, financial conditions, and academic workload before and during the COVID-19 outbreak; (2) the current level of mental well-being and effects on healthy lifestyles; (3) perceived stressors; (4) resources (e.g., social support and economic capital); (5) knowledge related to COVID-19; and (6) attitudes toward COVID-19 measures implemented by the government and relevant HEI. The dataset additionally includes information about COVID-19 measures taken by the government and HEI that were in place during the period of data collection. The collected data provide a comprehensive and comparative dataset on student well-being. In this article, we present the rationale for this study, the development and content of the survey, the methodology of data collection and sampling, and the limitations of the study. In addition, we highlight the opportunities that the dataset provides for advancing social science research on student well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic in varying policy contexts. Thus far, this is, to our knowledge, the first cross-country student well-being survey during the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in a unique dataset that enables high-priority socially relevant research.","Van de Velde, Sarah; Buffel, Veerle; Bracke, Piet; Van Hal, Guido; Somogyi, Nikolett M; Willems, Barbara; Wouters, Edwin",Scand J Public Health,96,11

BACKGROUND: IPT augments the control of body balance in contact receivers without a provision of mechanical body weight support. The nature of the processes governing the social haptic interaction, whether they are predominantly reactive or predictive, is uncertain. METHOD: Ten healthy adult individuals performed maximum forward reaching (MFR) without visual feedback while standing upright. We evaluated their control of reaching behavior and of body balance during IPT provided by either another human individual or by a robotic system in two alternative control modes (reactive vs. predictive). RESULTS: Reaching amplitude was not altered by any condition but all IPT conditions showed reduced body sway in the MFR end-state. Changes in reaching behavior under robotic IPT conditions, such as lower speed and straighter direction, were linked to reduced body sway. An Index of Performance expressed a potential trade-off between speed and accuracy with lower bitrate in the IPT conditions. CONCLUSION: The robotic IPT system was as supportive as human IPT. Robotic IPT seemed to afford more specific adjustments in the human contact receiver, such as trading reduced speed for increased accuracy, to meet the intrinsic demands and constraints of the robotic system or the demands of the social context when in contact with a human contact provider.","Johannsen, Leif; Potwar, Karna; Saveriano, Matteo; Endo, Satoshi; Lee, Dongheui",Hum Factors,96,16

Increased presenteeism, decreased absenteeism, and low uptake of the influenza vaccine can contribute to the spread of influenza among HCP in healthcare settings. We used a mixed methods approach to investigate attitudes and behaviors of HCP in Israel towards influenza vaccination, presenteeism, and absenteeism. METHODS: The study took place over three influenza seasons (2016-2017, 2017-2018, 2018-2019) at the largest hospital in southern Israel. We administered a Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices (KAP) questionnaire and conducted semi-structured interviews with HCP who had been recently ill with respiratory symptoms. The KAP questionnaire included closed-ended questions about attitudes and behaviors regarding influenza, working while sick, and influenza vaccination. The interviews investigated HCP's perceptions of influenza infection and attitudes about absenteeism, presenteeism, and the influenza vaccine. RESULTS: We conducted 74 semi-structured interviews over three influenza seasons. Four HCP were interviewed twice, in separate seasons for different illness episodes. The 70 individuals interviewed included 16 physicians, 45 nurses or technicians, and 9 administrative staff. The median age was 42.5 years (range: 25-60), and most (79%) were female. Half (50%) got vaccinated against influenza before their illness episode. In interviews, most HCP said they come to work while sick (presenteeism) due to a strong personal work ethic and an institutional culture that discourages taking sick leave (absenteeism). HCP expressed skepticism about the effectiveness of the influenza vaccine as well as concern that the influenza vaccine causes severe illness. DISCUSSION: Over three influenza seasons in Israel, HCP cited a number of reasons for working while sick, and doubted the usefulness of influenza vaccine. Addressing reasons for presenteeism and vaccine hesitancy among HCP is crucial to protect HCP and patients from influenza virus infection and other viral respiratory illnesses, such as COVID-19.","Gur-Arie, Rachel; Katz, Mark A; Hirsch, Avital; Greenberg, David; Malosh, Ryan; Newes-Adeyi, Gabriella; Davidovitch, Nadav; Rosenthal, Anat",Vaccine,96,21

However, there is mounting evidence for a much broader symptom spectrum, including psychiatric symptoms. Disordered sleep has previously been linked with dissociative symptoms, which may imply that patients with narcolepsy are more prone to develop such symptoms. Objectives: To investigate the frequency of dissociative symptoms in adult patients with narcolepsy type 1 compared to population controls. Methods: In a retrospective case control study, sixty adult patients fulfilling the criteria for narcolepsy type 1 and 120 matched population control subjects received a structured interview using the Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN) to assess dissociative symptoms and disorders. Results: A majority of narcolepsy patients reported dissociative symptoms, and even fulfilled the DSM-IV-TR criteria of a dissociative disorder (62% vs 1% in controls, p < .001). Most frequently reported symptoms were ""dissociative amnesia"" (37% vs 1%, p < .001) and ""dissociative disorder of voluntary movement"" (32% vs 1%, p < .001). Conclusion: Dissociative symptoms are strikingly prevalent in adult patients with narcolepsy type 1. Although a formal diagnosis of dissociation disorder should not be made as the symptoms can be explained by narcolepsy as an underlying condition, the findings do illustrate the extent and severity of the dissociative symptoms. As for the pathophysiological mechanism, there may be symptom overlap between narcolepsy and dissociation disorder. However, there may also be a more direct link between disrupted sleep and dissociative symptoms. In either case, the high frequency of occurrence of dissociative symptoms should result in an active inquiry by doctors, to improve therapeutic management and guidance.","Quaedackers, Laury; Droogleever Fortuyn, Hal; Van Gilst, Merel; Lappenschaar, Martijn; Overeem, Sebastiaan",Behav Sleep Med,96,15

However, determining properties of individual muscles in vivo remains a challenge because muscles usually function within a synergistic group. Modeling has been used to estimate the properties of an individual muscle from the experimental measurement of the muscle group properties. While this approach can be valuable, the models and the associated predictions are difficult to validate. In this study, we measured the in situ F-V properties of the maximally activated kangaroo rat plantarflexor group and used two different assumptions and associated models to estimate the properties of the individual plantarflexors. The first model (Mdl1) assumed that the percent contributions of individual muscles to group force and power were based upon the muscles' cross-sectional areas and were constant across the different isotonic loads applied to the muscle group. The second model (Mdl2) assumed that the F-V properties of the fibers within each muscle were identical, but due to differences in muscle architecture, the muscles' contributions to the group properties changed with isotonic load. We compared the two model predictions to independent estimates of the muscles' contributions based upon sonomicrometry (SONO) measurements of muscle lengths. We found that predictions from Mdl2 were not significantly different from SONO based estimates while those from Mdl1 were significantly different. The results of this study show that incorporating appropriate fiber properties and muscle architecture is necessary to parse the individual muscles' contributions to the group F-V properties.","Javidi, Mehrdad; McGowan, Craig P; Lin, David C",J. exp. biol,96,1

The aim was therefore to evaluate the two separate production lots of a commercial POC lateral flow test, intended for the detection of IgM and IgG against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S1). Control samples consisted of serum from individuals with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and pre-COVID-19 negative sera gathered from a biobank. The presence of anti-S1 IgM/IgG in the sera was verified by an in-house Luminex-based serological assay (COVID-19 SIA). One hundred samples were verified as positive for anti-S1 IgG and 74 for anti-S1 IgM. Two hundred samples were verified as negative for anti-S1 IgM/IgG. For the two lots of the POC-test, the sensitivities were 93.2% and 87.8% for IgM and 93.0% and 100% for IgG. The specificities were 100% for IgM and 99.5% for IgG. The positive predictive value was 100% for IgM and 98.9% and 99.0% for IgG. The negative predictive value was 97.6% and 95.7% for IgM, and 96.6% and 100% for IgG. The evaluated POC-test is suitable to assess anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1 IgM and IgG, as a measure of previous virus exposure on an individual level.

To limit viral transmission of infection, by March 10th, 2020, the Italian Government has ordered a national lockdown, which established home confinement, home (smart) working, and temporary closure of non-essential businesses and schools. The present study investigated how these restrictive measures impacted mothers and their pre-school children's behavioral habits (i.e., sleep timing and quality, subjective time experience) and psychological well-being (i.e., emotion regulation, self-regulation capacity). An online survey was administered to 245 mothers with pre-school children (from 2 to 5 years). Mothers were asked to fill the survey thinking both on their habits, behaviors, and emotions and on those of their children during the quarantine, and retrospectively, before the national lockdown (i.e., in late February). A general worsening of sleep quality and distortion of time experience in both mothers and children, as well as increasing emotional symptoms and self-regulation difficulties in children, was observed. Moreover, even when the interplay between the behavioral and psychological factors was investigated, the factor that seems to mostly impact both mothers' and children's psychological well-being was their sleep quality. Overall, central institutions urgently need to implementing special programs for families, including not only psychological support to sustain families with working parents and ameliorating children's management.","Di Giorgio, Elisa; Di Riso, Daniela; Mioni, Giovanna; Cellini, Nicola",Eur. child adolesc. psychiatry,96,24

In this study we generated a rabbit MAb (RAb) detecting SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (NP), which has cross-reaction with SARS-CoV-1 NP, but not with NPs of MERS and common human CoVs (OC43, NL63, 229E, and HKU1). With truncated NP fragments and synthesized peptides, the linear epitope detected by RAb was mapped in peptide N4-8, 393-407 amino acid residue (TLLPAADLDDFSKQL) of SARS-CoV-2 NP. This epitope N4-8 was highly conserved in SARSr-CoVs, including SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, and bat CoV RaTG13 strain. However, the corresponding peptide of bat SARSr-CoV BtKY72 strain could not be recognized by RAb, which indicates amino acid D399 may be critical for N4-8 epitope detected by RAb.

Guidelines regarding face mask use have evolved from the time when COVID-19 first emerged. Practices for face mask use in the United States vary widely. METHODS: Clinical and nonclinical staff from a pediatric health care system were invited to complete a survey regarding perceptions and practices of face mask use during the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall results were analyzed, and subgroup analyses were conducted to compare clinical and nonclinical staff, and clinical staff who do and do not provide direct patient care. RESULTS: The response rate was approximately 24% (1,128 of 4,698). Most respondents were clinical staff who provide patient care. A surgical/procedure mask was most often worn for patient care by 72% (P < .001). Most respondents (70%) reported wearing a cloth mask when not in the hospital (P < .001). Cloth masks were worn for a mean of 3.4 ± 3.9 d before washing. Frequent hand hygiene before putting on the mask, before removing, and after removing was reported as 56%, 44%, and 62%, respectively. The most common challenges reported were glasses fogging (69%), skin irritations (45%), and headaches (31%). Qualitative data revealed themes of feeling unsafe, beliefs and practices about COVID-19 and masks, mandates and enforcement of wearing masks, availability of personal protective equipment, and care delivery challenges. CONCLUSIONS: Practices and perceptions of face masks varied among staff in a pediatric health care system.

There are many reports on potential risk factors for severe disease, but few reports have reported a relationship between antibody titer and severity in Japan. Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) is one such factor theorized to affect the worsening of disease. We have been evaluating IgG responses in COVID-19 patients at our tertiary hospital. A measure of interest is the IgG index, we assigned 1.4 as the cutoff value for a positive result according to the manufacturer indication and observed that patients could be categorised into two distinct groups: early elevation of IgG and late elevation of IgG (IgG elevated in the first 7 days ± 2 days or more than 10 days after symptom onset). We defined the former as early-IgG responders (N=7) and the latter as late-IgG responders (N=14) and compared them. C-reactive protein and D-dimer levels were significantly higher on admission (HD 0) and the respiratory rate was higher, lymphocytes were lower significantly on day 7 of hospitalization (HD 7) in the early-IgG responders. These results might implicate that early production of anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 IgG may be associated with clinical indicator for severity.","Maeda, Tadashi; Kashiwagi, Katsuhito; Yoshizawa, Sadako; Sato, Takahiro; Aoki, Kotaro; Ishii, Yoshikazu; Tateda, Kazuhiro",Jpn. j. infect. dis,96,24

Here, we show that RIF1 must be present both during replication stress and in the ensuing recovery period to promote cell survival. Of two isoforms produced by alternative splicing, we find that RIF1-Long alone can protect cells against replication inhibition, but RIF1-Short is incapable of mediating protection. Consistent with this isoform-specific role, RIF1-Long is required to promote the formation of the 53BP1 nuclear bodies that protect unrepaired damage sites in the G1 phase following replication stress. Overall, our observations show that RIF1 is needed at several cell cycle stages after replication insult, with the RIF1-Long isoform playing a specific role during the ensuing G1 phase in damage site protection.","Watts, Lotte P; Natsume, Toyoaki; Saito, Yuichiro; Garzon, Javier; Dong, Qianqian; Boteva, Lora; Gilbert, Nick; Kanemaki, Masato T; Hiraga, Shin-Ichiro; Donaldson, Anne D",eLife (Cambridge),96,23

It is ideally placed to both provide and contribute to care for patients, families, communities and colleagues during the pandemic. Where recovery is uncertain, emphasis should be on care and relief of suffering, as well as survival. Where healthcare resources and facilities come under intense pressure, lessons can be learnt from models of care in other settings around the world. This article explores how the field can contribute by ensuring that PC principles and practices are woven into everyday healthcare practice. We explore alternative ways of providing care under such pressure and discuss three areas of learning from resource-limited settings: (1) integration of palliative medicine into everyday practice, (2) simplification of biomedical management plus multidisciplinary teamwork and (3) effective use of volunteers.","Knights, Daniel; Knights, Felicity; Lawrie, Iain",BMJ support. palliat. care (Online),96,1

During this time of social distancing, limited in-person visits, and uncertainty, patients and donors are relying more than ever on telemedicine and web-based information. Several factors can influence patients' understanding of web-based information, such as delivery modes (instruction, interaction, and assessment) and social-epistemological dimensions (choices in interactive knowledge building). OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to systemically evaluate the content, delivery modes, and social-epistemological dimensions of web-based information on COVID-19 and renal transplantation at time of the pandemic. METHODS: Multiple keyword combinations were used to retrieve websites on COVID-19 and renal transplantation using the search engines Google.com and Google.nl. From 14 different websites, 30 webpages were examined to determine their organizational sources, topics, delivery modes, and social-epistemological dimensions. RESULTS: The variety of topics and delivery modes was limited. A total of 13 different delivery modes were encountered, of which 8 (62%) were instructional and 5 (38%) were interactional; no assessment delivery modes were observed. No website offered all available delivery modes. The majority of delivery modes (8/13, 62%) focused on individual and passive learning, whereas group learning and active construction of knowledge were rarely encountered. CONCLUSIONS: By taking interactive knowledge transfer into account, the educational quality of eHealth for transplant care could increase, especially in times of crisis when rapid knowledge transfer is needed.","van Klaveren, Charlotte W; de Jong, Peter G M; Hendriks, Renée A; Luk, Franka; de Vries, Aiko P J; van der Boog, Paul J M; Reinders, Marlies E J",J Med Internet Res,96,16

METHODS: A 66-year-old woman with Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) and a unilateral Descemet's membrane endothelial keratoplasty (DMEK) transplant received COVID-19 mRNA vaccine BNT162b2 14 days post-transplant. Seven days later, she presented with symptoms and signs of endothelial graft rejection. An 83-year-old woman with bilateral DMEK transplants for FECD 3 and 6 years earlier developed simultaneous acute endothelial rejection in both eyes, 3 weeks post second dose of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine BNT162b2. Rejection in both cases was treated successfully with topical corticosteroids. CONCLUSIONS: We believe this is the first report of temporal association between corneal transplant rejection following immunisation against COVID-19 and the first report of DMEK rejection following any immunisation. We hypothesise that the allogeneic response may have been initiated by the host antibody response following vaccination. Clinicians and patients should be aware of the potential of corneal graft rejection associated with vaccine administration and may wish to consider vaccination in advance of planned non-urgent keratoplasties. Patients should be counselled on the symptoms and signs that require urgent review to allow early treatment of any confirmed rejection episode.","Phylactou, Maria; Li, Ji-Peng Olivia; Larkin, Daniel F P",Br. j. ophthalmol,96,10

METHODS: A systematic review was performed using the PRISMA guidelines. All clinical studies, reviews, consensus and guidelines related to the above medications and COVID-19 were included. RESULTS: A total of 18 articles were included. The use of analgesia, anti-inflammatories, steroids, anticoagulants, antibiotics, vitamin B, vitamin C and vitamin D and their potential impact on COVID-19 patients were reported. CONCLUSION: Eight main recommendations were derived from the review. Firstly, paracetamol remains the first line of analgesia and antipyretic. Secondly, there is no need to avoid NSAIDs for COVID-19 patients. Thirdly, opioids have the potential for immunosuppression in addition to respiratory depression and, therefore, should be prescribed with care in COVID-19 patients. Fourthly, patients with conditions where steroids are proven to be efficacious can continue to receive their steroids; otherwise, systemic steroids are not recommended for COVID-19 patients. Fifthly, orthopaedic surgeons following up on COVID-19 patients who are using steroids should continue to follow them up for possible avascular necrosis. Sixthly, whenever possible, oral anticoagulation should be converted to parental heparin. Seventhly, common orthopaedic antibiotics including penicillin and clindamycin are safe to continue for COVID-19 patients. However, for COVID-19 patients, the antibiotics can potentially be switched to macrolides and tetracyclines if the organisms are sensitive. Lastly, prescription for vitamins B, C and D should continue as per usual clinical practice.","Tan, Si Heng Sharon; Hong, Choon Chiet; Saha, Soura; Murphy, Diarmuid; Hui, James Hoipo",Int Orthop,96,21

As with other coronaviruses, a preponderance of evidence suggests the virus originated in horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus spp.) and may have infected an intermediate host prior to spillover into humans. A significant concern is that SARS-CoV-2 could become established in secondary reservoir hosts outside of Asia. To assess this potential, we challenged deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) with SARS-CoV-2 and found robust virus replication in the upper respiratory tract, lungs and intestines, with detectable viral RNA for up to 21 days in oral swabs and 6 days in lungs. Virus entry into the brain also occurred, likely via gustatory-olfactory-trigeminal pathway with eventual compromise to the blood-brain barrier. Despite this, no conspicuous signs of disease were observed, and no deer mice succumbed to infection. Expression of several innate immune response genes were elevated in the lungs, including IFN&#945;, IFNß, Cxcl10, Oas2, Tbk1 and Pycard. Elevated CD4 and CD8ß expression in the lungs was concomitant with Tbx21, IFNÎ³ and IL-21 expression, suggesting a type I inflammatory immune response. Contact transmission occurred from infected to naive deer mice through two passages, showing sustained natural transmission and localization into the olfactory bulb, recapitulating human neuropathology. In the second deer mouse passage, an insertion of 4 amino acids occurred to fixation in the N-terminal domain of the spike protein that is predicted to form a solvent-accessible loop. Subsequent examination of the source virus from BEI Resources determined the mutation was present at very low levels, demonstrating potent purifying selection for the insert during in vivo passage. Collectively, this work has determined that deer mice are a suitable animal model for the study of SARS-CoV-2 respiratory disease and neuropathogenesis, and that they have the potential to serve as secondary reservoir hosts in North America.","Fagre, Anna; Lewis, Juliette; Eckley, Miles; Zhan, Shijun; Rocha, Savannah M; Sexton, Nicole R; Burke, Bradly; Geiss, Brian; Peersen, Olve; Bass, Todd; Kading, Rebekah; Rovnak, Joel; Ebel, Gregory D; Tjalkens, Ronald B; Aboellail, Tawfik; Schountz, Tony",PLoS Pathog,96,24

Widely reported U.S. excess death estimates have not accounted for recent population changes, especially increases in the population older than 65 years. OBJECTIVE: To estimate excess deaths in the United States in 2020, after accounting for population changes. DESIGN: Surveillance study. SETTING: United States, March to August 2020. PARTICIPANTS: All decedents. MEASUREMENTS: Age-specific excess deaths in the United States from 1 March to 31 August 2020 compared with 2015 to 2019 were estimated, after changes in population size and age were taken into account, by using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provisional death data and U.S. Census Bureau population estimates. Cause-specific excess deaths were estimated by month and age. RESULTS: From March through August 2020, 1 671 400 deaths were registered in the United States, including 173 300 COVID-19 deaths. An average of 1 370 000 deaths were reported over the same months during 2015 to 2019, for a crude excess of 301 400 deaths (128 100 non-COVID-19 deaths). However, the 2020 U.S. population includes 5.04 million more persons aged 65 years and older than the average population in 2015 to 2019 (a 10% increase). After population changes were taken into account, an estimated 217 900 excess deaths occurred from March through August 2020 (173 300 COVID-19 and 44 600 non-COVID-19 deaths). Most excess non-COVID-19 deaths occurred in April, July, and August, and 34 900 (78%) were in persons aged 25 to 64 years. Diabetes, Alzheimer disease, and heart disease caused the most non-COVID-19 excess deaths. LIMITATION: Provisional death data are underestimated because of reporting delays. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in an estimated 218 000 excess deaths in the United States between March and August 2020, and 80% of those deaths had COVID-19 as the underlying cause. Accounting for population changes substantially reduced the excess non-COVID-19 death estimates, providing important information for guiding future clinical and public health interventions.

A new layer normalization scheme is proposed to allow a scaling to propagate through attention layers, which helps the model achieve remarkable accuracy in operator learning tasks with unnormalized data. Finally, we present three operator learning experiments, including the viscid Burgers' equation, an interface Darcy flow, and an inverse interface coefficient identification problem.

This is likely to be more challenging then the first wave for the diagnosis of COVID-19 because of the similar symptomology with other respiratory conditions highly prevalent in winter. This study sought to understand the care pathways in place in UK NHS hospitals during the first wave (March-July 2020) for identification of patients with COVID-19 and to learn lessons to inform optimal testing strategies within the COVID-19 National Diagnostic Research and Evaluation Platform (CONDOR). DESIGN, SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Sixteen hospital-based clinicians from 12 UK NHS Trusts covering 10 different specialties were interviewed following a semi-structured topic guide. Data were coded soon after the interviews and analysed thematically. RESULTS: We developed a diagrammatic, high-level visualisation of the care pathway describing the main clinical decisions associated with the diagnosis and management of patients with suspected COVID-19. COVID-19 testing influenced infection control considerations more so than treatment decisions. Two main features of service provision influenced the patient management significantly: access to rapid laboratory testing and the number of single occupancy rooms. If time to return of result was greater than 24 h, patients with a presumptive diagnosis would often be cohorted based on clinical suspicion alone. Undetected COVID-19 during this time could therefore lead to an increased risk of viral transmission. CONCLUSIONS: During the winter months, priority for provision of rapid testing at admission should be given to hospitals with limited access to laboratory services and single room availability. Access to rapid testing is essential for urgent decisions related to emergency surgery, maternity services and organ transplant. The pathway and prioritization of need will inform the economic modelling, clinical evaluations, and implementation of new clinical tests in UK.","Hicks, Timothy; Winter, Amanda; Green, Kile; Kierkegaard, Patrick; Price, D Ashley; Body, Richard; Allen, A Joy; Graziadio, Sara",BMC Health Serv Res,96,24

In March 2020, the Australian Government introduced telehealth services to ensure that people more vulnerable to COVID-19 do not delay routine care from their general practitioners. Evidence about patients' experience of telehealth and its impact on patient care is scarce. This study aimed to investigate the experience with telehealth by Australian general practice patients at high risk of poor health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with 30 patients from nine general practices in metropolitan Adelaide (May-June 2020). Participants were identified by their regular doctor as being at high risk of poor health outcomes. Interviews sought participants' perspectives and experiences about telehealth services in the general practice setting during COVID-19, and the value of offering continued telehealth services post pandemic. Interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data were analysed using a coding structure developed based on deductive codes derived from the research questions and any additional concepts that emerged inductively from interviews. RESULTS: Participants expressed satisfaction with telehealth including convenient and timely access to general practice services. Yet, participants identified challenges including difficulties in expressing themselves and accessing physical exams. Prescription renewal, discussing test results and simple follow-ups were the most common reasons that telehealth was used. Telehealth was mainly via phone that better suited those with low digital literacy. Participants indicated that an existing doctor-patient relationship was important for telehealth services to be effective. Subjects believed that telehealth services should be continued but needed to be combined with opportunities for face-to-face consultations after the COVID-19 pandemic was over. CONCLUSIONS: The expansion of telehealth supported access to general practice including chronic disease management during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the future, telehealth in Australia is likely to have a stronger place in primary healthcare policy and practice and an increased acceptance amongst patients.","Javanparast, Sara; Roeger, Leigh; Kwok, Yuen; Reed, Richard L",BMC Fam Pract,96,16

Magnetoionic approaches appear particularly promising, electrolytes and ionic conductors being capable of on/off control of ferromagnetism and tuning of magnetic anisotropy. A clear limitation, however, is that these devices either electrically tune a known ferromagnet or electrically induce ferromagnetism from another magnetic state, e.g., antiferromagnetic. Here, we demonstrate that ferromagnetism can be voltage-induced even from a diamagnetic (zero-spin) state suggesting that useful magnetic phases could be electrically induced in ""nonmagnetic"" materials. We use ionic liquid-gated diamagnetic FeS2 as a model system, showing that as little as 1 V induces a reversible insulator-metal transition by electrostatic surface inversion. Anomalous Hall measurements then reveal electrically tunable surface ferromagnetism at up to 25 K.

However, there are concerns that patients did not seek necessary health care because of these mandates. PURPOSE: To evaluate the differences in the clinical presentation of acute appendicitis and CT findings related to these cases between the COVID-19 acute pandemic period and nonpandemic period. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective observational study was performed to compare the acute pandemic period (March 23, 2020, to May 4, 2020) versus the same period the year before (March 23, 2019, to May 4, 2019). The proportion of appendicitis diagnosed by CT and level of severity of the disease were reviewed in each case. Univariate and bivariate analyses were performed to identify significant differences between the two groups. RESULTS: A total of 196 abdominal CT scans performed due to suspected acute appendicitis were evaluated: 55 from the acute pandemic period and 141 from the nonpandemic period. The proportion of acute appendicitis diagnosed by abdominal CT was higher in the acute pandemic period versus the nonpandemic period: 45.5% versus 29.8% (P = .038). The severity of the diagnosed appendicitis was higher during the acute pandemic period: 92% versus 57.1% (P = .003). CONCLUSION: During the acute COVID-19 pandemic period, fewer patients presented with acute appendicitis to the emergency room, and those who did presented at a more severe stage of the disease.","Romero, Javier; Valencia, Sergio; Guerrero, Andres",J Am Coll Radiol,96,7

In Beijing, measured daily mean peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN) concentrations reached 4 ppb over the lockdown period (24 January to 15 February), whose averages were 2-3 times that before lockdown (1-23 January). The lockdown PAN levels also reached a high historical record based on our long-term measurements (2016-2019). Unlike ozone and PM2.5, PAN formation depends on less complex photochemistry between NOx and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), providing a novel approach to investigate the wintertime photochemistry during COVID-19. The GEOS-Chem simulations suggest a markedly enhanced photochemistry by a factor of 2 during the lockdown. Change of meteorology featuring with anomalous wind convergence under higher temperatures is the main reason for enhanced photochemical formation of PAN, while chemically nonlinear feedbacks also play a role. Our results suggest implementing targeted VOC emission controls in the context of increasing photochemical pollution over this complex polluted region.","Qiu, YuLu Ma ZhiQiang Li Ke Lin WeiLi Tang YingXiao Dong Fan Liao Hong",Geophysical Research Letters,96,24

In the second example, we demonstrate that the QCD axion can have its number abundance enhanced allowing for misalignment driven axion dark matter all the way down to $f_a$ of order astrophysical bounds. In the third example, we show that the delayed oscillation of the scalar field can also sustain a period of inflation.

Although, various research on therapeutic measures to solve this pandemic crisis has been published; no favourable results have been achieved. We propose the use of potential FDA-approved dual inhibitors which can inhibit two targets (either on entry-level or the main protease) for the effective treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We screened 12 FDA-approved antiviral inhibitors listed in Drug bank and analysed the ADMET properties of each drug of interest to study the bioavailability, safety and toxicity. Two potential targets, the spike protein and the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 obtained from PDB have been used for molecular docking. All the selected drugs were docked with both targets and demonstrated strong hydrogen bond (HB) interactions in multiple active sites. Amongst these, the range of binding energy was from 3-7 kcal/mol for spike protein and 2-8 kcal/mol for the main protease. Upon comparison of all the processed drugs ganciclovir and zanamivir displayed significant binding energy with HB interactions with both, spike (-9.2 and -9 kcal/mol respectively) and the main protease (-9 kcal/mol). Ribavirin and tenofovir showed significant binding energy above -8 kcal/mol with seven HB interactions with the main protease and also spike protein. The novel findings regarding the antiviral properties of these dual inhibitors using a computational approach will be a good starting point for the efficacy determination of these drugs for pre-clinical and clinical studies aimed at developing active antivirals to target SARS-CoV-2.

Here we present key position statements including observations about the pathophysiology of (ARF). In terms of the pathophysiology of pulmonary infection with SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19 can be divided into 3 phases. Pulmonary damage in advanced COVID-19 often differs from the known changes in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Two types (type L and type H) are differentiated, corresponding to early- and late-stage lung damage. This differentiation should be taken into consideration in the respiratory support of ARF. The assessment of the extent of ARF should be based on arterial or capillary blood gas analysis under room air conditions, and it needs to include the calculation of oxygen supply (measured from the variables of oxygen saturation, hemoglobin level, the corrected values of Hüfner's factor, and cardiac output). Aerosols can cause transmission of infectious, virus-laden particles. Open systems or vented systems can increase the release of respirable particles. Procedures in which the invasive ventilation system must be opened and endotracheal intubation carried out are associated with an increased risk of infection. Personal protective equipment (PPE) should have top priority because fear of contagion should not be a primary reason for intubation. Based on the current knowledge, inhalation therapy, nasal high-flow therapy (NHF), continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), or noninvasive ventilation (NIV) can be performed without an increased risk of infection to staff if PPE is provided. A significant proportion of patients with ARF present with relevant hypoxemia, which often cannot be fully corrected, even with a high inspired oxygen fraction (FiO2) under NHF. In this situation, the oxygen therapy can be escalated to CPAP or NIV when the criteria for endotracheal intubation are not met. In ARF, NIV should be carried out in an intensive care unit or a comparable setting by experienced staff. Under CPAP/NIV, a patient can deteriorate rapidly. For this reason, continuous monitoring and readiness for intubation are to be ensured at all times. If the ARF progresses under CPAP/NIV, intubation should be implemented without delay in patients who do not have a ""do not intubate"" order.","Pfeifer, Michael; Ewig, Santiago; Voshaar, Thomas; Randerath, Winfried Johannes; Bauer, Torsten; Geiseler, Jens; Dellweg, Dominic; Westhoff, Michael; Windisch, Wolfram; Schönhofer, Bernd; Kluge, Stefan; Lepper, Philipp M",Respiration,96,20

Massive increment of cases and deaths occurred in China and 209 countries in Europe, America, Australia, Asia and Pakistan. Pakistan was first hit by COVID-19 when a case was reported in Karachi on 26 February 2020. Several methods were presented to model the death rate due to the COVID-19 pandemic and to forecast the pinnacle of reported deaths. Still, these methods were not used in identifying the first day when Pakistan enters or exits the early exponential growth phase. OBJECTIVE: The present study intends to monitor variations in deaths and identify the growth phases such as pre-growth, growth, and post-growth phases in Pakistan due to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: New approaches are needed that display the death patterns and signal an alarming situation so that corrective actions can be taken before the condition worsens. To meet this purpose, secondary data on daily reported deaths due to the COVID-19 pandemic have been considered, and the $c$ and exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) control charts are used To meet this purpose, secondary data on daily reported deaths in Pakistan due to the COVID-19 pandemic have been considered. The $ c$ and exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) control charts have been used for monitoring variations. RESULTS: The chart shows that Pakistan switches from the pre-growth to the growth phase on 31 March 2020. The EWMA chart demonstrates that Pakistan remains in the growth phase from 31 March 2020 to 17 August 2020, with some indications signaling a decrease in deaths. It is found that Pakistan moved to a post-growth phase for a brief period from 27 July 2020 to 28 July 2020. Pakistan switches to re-growth phase with an alarm on 31/7/2020, right after the short-term post-growth phase. The number of deaths starts decreasing in August in that Pakistan may approach the post-growth phase shortly. CONCLUSION: This amalgamation of control charts illustrates a systematic implementation of the charts for government leaders and forefront medical teams to facilitate the rapid detection of daily reported deaths due to COVID-19. Besides government and public health officials, it is also the public's responsibility to follow the enforced standard operating procedures as a temporary remedy of this pandemic in ensuring public safety while awaiting a suitable vaccine to be discovered.","Mahmood, Yasar; Ishtiaq, Sunaina; Khoo, Michael B C; Teh, Sin Yin; Khan, Hina",Int. j. qual. health care,96,20

Despite its ubiquity in the hospital, consensus on much of its management is lacking. METHODS: Representatives from ID, Podiatry, and Pathology interested in quality improvement (QI) developed multidisciplinary institutional recommendations culminating in an educational intervention describing optimal diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to DFO. Knowledge acquisition was assessed by pre- and post-intervention surveys. Inpatients with forefoot DFO were retrospectively reviewed pre- and post- intervention to assess frequency of recommended diagnostic and therapeutic maneuvers, including appropriate definition of surgical bone margins, definitive histopathology reports, and unnecessary intravenous antibiotics or prolonged antibiotic courses. RESULTS: A post-intervention survey revealed significant improvements in knowledge of antibiotic treatment duration and the role of oral antibiotics in managing DFO. There were 104 consecutive patients in the pre-intervention cohort (4/1/2018-4/1/2019) and 32 patients in the post-intervention cohort (11/5/2019-03/01/2020), the latter truncated by changes in hospital practice during the COVID-19 pandemic. Non-categorizable or equivocal pathology reports decreased from pre-intervention to post-intervention (27.0% vs 3.3%, respectively, P=0.006). We observed non-significant improvement in correct bone margin definition (74.0% vs 87.5%, p=0.11), unnecessary PICC line placement (18.3% vs 9.4%, p=0.23), and unnecessary prolonged antibiotics (21.9% vs 5.0%, p=0.10). Additionally, by working as an interdisciplinary group, many solvable misunderstandings were identified, and processes were adjusted to improve the quality of care provided to these patients. CONCLUSIONS: This QI initiative regarding management of DFO led to improved provider knowledge and collaborative competency between these three departments, improvements in definitive pathology reports, and non-significant improvement in several other clinical endpoints. Creating collaborative competency may be an effective local strategy to improve knowledge of diabetic foot infection and may generalize to other common multidisciplinary conditions.","Jhaveri, Vimal V; Sullivan, Christopher; Ward, Ashley; Giurini, John; Karchmer, A W; Stillman, Isaac E; Davis, Roger B; Freed, Jason A; LaSalvia, Mary T; Stead, Wendy",J.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess sleep among a sample of predominantly US frontline health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic using validated measures through a survey distributed on social media. METHODS: A self-selection survey was distributed on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram for 16 days (August 31 to September 15, 2020), targeting health care workers who were clinically active during the COVID-19 pandemic. Study participants completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), and they reported their demographic and career information. Poor sleep quality was defined as a PSQI score &#8805;5. Moderate-to-severe insomnia was defined as an ISI score >14. The Mini-Z Burnout Survey was used to measure burnout. Multivariate logistic regression tested associations between demographics, career characteristics, and sleep outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 963 surveys were completed. Participants were predominantly White (894/963, 92.8%), female (707/963, 73.4%), aged 30-49 years (692/963, 71.9%), and physicians (620/963, 64.4%). Mean sleep duration was 6.1 hours (SD 1.2). Nearly 96% (920/963, 95.5%) of participants reported poor sleep (PSQI). One-third (288/963, 30%) reported moderate or severe insomnia. Many participants (554/910, 60.9%) experienced sleep disruptions due to device use or had nightmares at least once per week (420/929, 45.2%). Over 50% (525/932, 56.3%) reported burnout. In multivariable logistic regressions, nonphysician (odds ratio [OR] 2.4, 95% CI 1.7-3.4), caring for patients with COVID-19 (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.2-2.8), Hispanic ethnicity (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.4-3.5), female sex (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.1-2.4), and having a sleep disorder (OR 4.3, 95% CI 2.7-6.9) were associated with increased odds of insomnia. In open-ended comments (n=310), poor sleep was mapped to four categories: children and family, work demands, personal health, and pandemic-related sleep disturbances. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, nearly all the frontline health care workers surveyed on social media reported poor sleep, over one-third reported insomnia, and over half reported burnout. Many also reported sleep disruptions due to device use and nightmares.

To help policymakers interested in further enhancing primary care delivery of COVID-19 vaccines, it is important to estimate the absolute number of vaccination opportunities, and identify how these opportunities may fall disproportionately among different communities given the unequal way that COVID-19 falls upon communities of color, low-income, and rural communities. To quantify the potential benefits of greater primary care engagement in vaccination efforts, we estimated the number of potential vaccination opportunities (PVOs) in primary care in the remaining calendar months of year 2021, and the possible uptake if we supplied enough vaccine to primary care practices to fulfill their opportunities. To estimate how many potential vaccination opportunities (PVOs) may occur in primary care, we used three sets of data, analyzing the latest available waves of the following: (i) the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS, 2016, N = 677 providers); (ii) the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS, 2018, N = 29,839 individuals in 29,839 households); and (iii) the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS, 2018, N = 40,025 individuals in 14,500 households). Per the NAMCS data, which provide a nationally-representative sample of ambulatory care visits, primary care physicians normally provide 40.2 million primary care visits per month. The majority of the primary care utilization is absorbed by those aged 16 to 64 years old who are not otherwise priority groups (i.e., not having chronic diseases as defined by ACIP) but the second large group of visits are those with a chronic disease (27.2% of all visits). As compared to the NAMCS data providing an estimate of care from the perspective of providers, the overall sample in NHIS provides a view of primary care access and utilization from a population perspective. Per NHIS, 34% of the civilian US population saw a generalist physician in the prior calendar year, or 109.8 million people. Overall, we would estimate that over the latter half of calendar year 2021, approximately 15 million potential vaccine opportunities would be available through US primary care practices.","Basu, Sanjay; Weintraub, Rebecca; Ganguli, Ishani; Phillips, Russell; Phillips, Robert; Bitton, Asaf",,96,20

Many vaccine development studies at clinical trials are currently conducted to combat SARS-CoV-2. Plants are a rich source of phytochemicals with different biological activities, including antiviral activities, which are the focus of many studies. AREAS COVERED: This review shows compounds of traditional plants listed on RENISUS list have therapeutic properties against SARS-CoV-2 targets. EXPERT OPINION: The rise of new variants, more pathogenic and virulent, impacts in the increase of mortality from SARS-CoV-2 infection, and thus, the control of the outbreaks of disease remains a global challenge. Other's drug and vaccines development is an essential element in controlling SARS-COV-2. Therefore, it is imperative that approach to tackle this pandemic has to be solidly evidence-informed. It should be noticed that the immune system does play critical roles in fighting viruses. Studies show that T cells levels decreased continuously as the disease progressed. T cell-mediated cellular immune response, probably by immunological memory, is essential for direct virus eradication after infection whilst B cells functions in producing antibodies that neutralize virus.But, have distinct patterns of T cell response exist in different patients, suggesting the possibility of distinct clinical approaches. Efforts are concentrated to elucidate the underlying immunological mechanisms in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and progression for better design of diagnostic, therapeutic and preventive strategies. We seek to identify biomolecules with the potential to act in biomarkers that predict how severe the disease can get. But it is important to warn that the plants that produce the compounds mentioned here should not be used without a physician prescription. Finally, we speculate that these compounds may eventually attract the attention of physicians and researchers to perform tests in specific contexts of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and if they show positive results, be tested in Clinical trials.","Marmitt, Diorge Jônatas; Goettert, Márcia Inês; Rempel, Claudete",Expert Rev Clin Pharmacol,96,16

However, physical distancing between clinicians and patients with spine-related symptoms is not solely limited to restrictions imposed by pandemic-related lockdowns. In most low- and middle-income countries, as well as many underserved marginalized communities in high-income countries, there is little to no access to clinicians trained in evidence-based care for people experiencing spinal pain. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to describe the development and present the components of evidence-based patient and clinician guides for the management of spinal disorders where in-person care is not available. METHODS: Ultimately, two sets of guides were developed (one for patients and one for clinicians) by extracting information from the published Global Spine Care Initiative (GSCI) papers. An international, interprofessional team of 29 participants from 10 countries on 4 continents participated. The team included practitioners in family medicine, neurology, physiatry, rheumatology, psychology, chiropractic, physical therapy, and yoga, as well as epidemiologists, research methodologists, and laypeople. The participants were invited to review, edit, and comment on the guides in an open iterative consensus process. RESULTS: The Patient Guide is a simple 2-step process. The first step describes the nature of the symptoms or concerns. The second step provides information that a patient can use when considering self-care, determining whether to contact a clinician, or considering seeking emergency care. The Clinician Guide is a 5-step process: (1) Obtain and document patient demographics, location of primary clinical symptoms, and psychosocial information. (2) Review the symptoms noted in the patient guide. (3) Determine the GSCI classification of the patient's spine-related complaints. (4) Ask additional questions to determine the GSCI subclassification of the symptom pattern. (5) Consider appropriate treatment interventions. CONCLUSIONS: The Patient and Clinician Guides are designed to be sufficiently clear to be useful to all patients and clinicians, irrespective of their location, education, professional qualifications, and experience. However, they are comprehensive enough to provide guidance on the management of all spine-related symptoms or disorders, including triage for serious and specific diseases. They are consistent with widely accepted evidence-based clinical practice guidelines. They also allow for adequate documentation and medical record keeping. These guides should be of value during periods of government-mandated physical or social distancing due to infectious diseases, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic.

These individuals are particularly exposed to SARS-CoV-2 infection and at potential risk of reinfection. We followed 26 HCW with mild COVID-19 three weeks (D21), two months (M2) and three months (M3) after the onset of symptoms. All the HCW had anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) IgA at D21, decreasing to 38.5% at M3 (p < 0.0001). Concomitantly a significant decrease in NAb titers was observed between D21 and M2 (p = 0.03) and between D21 and M3 (p < 0.0001). Here, we report that SARS-CoV-2 can elicit a NAb response correlated with anti-RBD antibody levels. However, this neutralizing activity declines, and may even be lost, in association with a decrease in systemic IgA antibody levels, from two months after disease onset. This short-lasting humoral protection supports strong recommendations to maintain infection prevention and control measures in HCW, and suggests that periodic boosts of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination may be required.","Marot, Stéphane; Malet, Isabelle; Leducq, Valentin; Zafilaza, Karen; Sterlin, Delphine; Planas, Delphine; Gothland, Adélie; Jary, Aude; Dorgham, Karim; Bruel, Timothée; Burrel, Sonia; Boutolleau, David; Schwartz, Olivier; Gorochov, Guy; Calvez, Vincent; Marcelin, Anne-Geneviève",Nat Commun,96,24

Perceiving the pandemic situation throughout the world, Government of India restricted international passenger traffic through land check post (Liang, 2020) and imposed complete lockdown in the country on 24 March 2020. To study the impact of lockdown on disease dynamics we consider a three-dimensional mathematical model using nonlinear ordinary differential equations. The proposed model has been studied using stability theory of nonlinear ordinary differential equations. Basic reproduction ratio is computed and significant parameters responsible to keep basic reproduction ratio less than one are identified. The study reveals that disease vanishes from the system only if complete lockdown is imposed otherwise disease will always persist in the population. However, disease can be kept under control by implementing contact tracing and quarantine measures as well along with lockdown if lockdown is imposed partially.","Bhadauria, Archana Singh; Pathak, Rachana; Chaudhary, Manisha",,96,21

On the one hand, they provide guidance to policy-makers about the development of the epidemic and healthcare demand overtime; on the other hand, they are heavily criticized for their lack of credibility. This commentary reflects on three such models from a validity and usefulness perspective. Specifically, it discusses the complexity, validation, and communication of models informing the government decisions in the UK, US and Austria, and concludes that, although these models are useful in many ways, they currently lack a thorough validation and a clear communication of their uncertainties. Therefore, prediction claims of these models should be taken cautiously, and their merits on scenario analysis should be the basis for decision-making. The lessons that can be learned from the COVID models in terms of the communication of uncertainties and assumptions can guide the use of quantitative models in other policy-making areas.","Eker, Sibel",Hum.

We report the preliminary results of a targeted program of COVID-19 infection testing in the ED in the first 10 days of its initiation at our institution. METHODS: We conducted a review of prospectively collected data on all ED patients who had targeted testing for acute COVID-19 infection at two EDs during the initial 10 days of testing (March 10-19, 2020). During this initial period with limited resources, testing was targeted toward high-risk patients per Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines. Data collected from patients who were tested included demographics, clinical characteristics, and test qualifying criteria. We present the data overall and by test results with descriptive statistics. RESULTS: During the 10-day study period, the combined census of the study EDs was 2157 patient encounters. A total of 283 tests were ordered in the ED. The majority of patients were 18-64 years of age, male, non-Hispanic white, had an Emergency Severity Index score of three, did not have a fever, and were discharged from the ED. A total of 29 (10.2%) tested positive. Symptoms-based criteria most associated with COVID-19 were the most common criteria identified for testing (90.6%). All other criteria were reported in 5.51-43.0% of persons being tested. Having contact with a person under investigation was significantly more common in those who tested positive compared to those who tested negative (63% vs 24.5%, respectively). The majority of patients in both results groups had at least two qualifying criteria for testing (75.2%). CONCLUSION: In this review of prospectively collected data on all ED patients who had targeted testing for acute COVID-19 infection at two EDs in the first 10 days of testing, we found that 10.2% of those tested were identified as positive. The continued monitoring of testing and results will help providers understand how COVID-19 is progressing in the community.","Tolia, Vaishal M; Chan, Theodore C; Castillo, Edward M",West J Emerg Med,96,26

The first cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection were recorded in Ghana on March 12, 2020. Since then, the country has been combatting countrywide community spread. This report describes how the Virology Department, Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research (NMIMR) is supporting the Ghana Health Service (GHS) to diagnose infections with this virus in Ghana. Methods: The National Influenza Centre (NIC) in the Virology Department of the NMIMR, adopted real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (rRT-PCR) assays for the diagnosis of the SARS-CoV-2 in January 2020. Samples from suspected cases and contact tracing across Ghana were received and processed for SARS-CoV-2. Samples were 'pooled' to enable simultaneous batch testing of samples without reduced sensitivity. Outcomes: From February 3 to August 21, the NMIMR processed 283 946 (10%) samples. Highest number of cases were reported in June when the GHS embarked on targeted contact tracing which led to an increase in number of samples processed daily, peaking at over 7,000 samples daily. There were several issues to overcome including rapid consumption of reagents and consumables. Testing however continued successfully due to revised procedures, additional equipment and improved pipeline of laboratory supplies. Test results are now provided within 24 to 48 hours of sample submission enabling more effective response and containment. Conclusion: Following the identification of the first cases of SARS-CoV-2infection by the NMIMR, the Institute has trained other centres and supported the ramping up of molecular testing capacity in Ghana. This provides a blueprint to enable Ghana to mitigate further epidemics and pandemics. Funding: The laboratory work was supported with materials from the Ghana Health Service Ministry of Health, the US Naval Medical Research Unit #3, the World Health Organization, the Jack Ma Foundation and the University of Ghana Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research. Other research projects hosted by the Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research contributed reagents and laboratory consumables.

MATIRIAL OF STUDY: 55 patients who had undergone colporrhaphy and anterior levatoroplasty for rectocele in 2012- 2015 and contacted the clinic with complaints of ongoing obstructive defecation were included in this investigation. They had a comprehensive medical examination using defecography, ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, anorectal functional tests. This study revealed perineum descending in 20 patients, apical prolapse 23 patients, and 12 patients demonstrated simultaneous pathology. All these patients were performed additional abdominal sacrocolporectopexy in 2015-2017 and results were estimated. RESULTS: Abdominal sacrocolporectopexy significantly improved anatomical and functional results of previous surgery which was confirmed by the listed methods of research. The average location of the anorectal area and utero-cervical zone became higher. So, perineum descendents and apical prolapsed were improved. DISCUSSION: Sacrocolporectopexy is often used for surgical treatment of pelvic organ prolapse. Our study shows its efficiency in patients with perineum descending and upper rectocele.

Our aim was to study colonic ACE2 expression in Crohn's disease (CD) and non-inflammatory bowel disease (non-IBD) controls. We hypothesized that the colonic expression levels of ACE2 impacts CD course. Methods: We examined the expression of colon ACE2 using RNA-seq and quantitative (q) RT-PCR from 69 adult CD and 14 NIBD control patients. In a subset of this cohort we validated ACE2 protein expression and localization in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded matched colon and ileal tissues using immunohistochemistry. The impact of increased ACE2 expression in CD for the risk of surgery was evaluated by a multivariate regression analysis and a Kaplan-Meier estimator. To provide critical support for the generality of our findings, we analyzed previously published RNA-seq data from two large independent cohorts of CD patients. Results: Colonic ACE2 expression was significantly higher in a subset of adult CD patients (ACE2-high CD). IHC in a sampling of ACE2-high CD patients confirmed high ACE2 protein expression in the colon and ileum compared to ACE2-low CD and NIBD patients. Notably, we found that ACE2-high CD patients are significantly more likely to undergo surgery within 5 years of diagnosis, with a Cox regression analysis finding that high ACE2 levels is an independent risk factor (OR 2.18; 95%CI, 1.05-4.55; p=0.037). Conclusion: Increased intestinal expression of ACE2 is associated with deteriorated clinical outcomes in CD patients. These data point to the need for molecular stratification that may impact CD disease-related outcomes.","Toyonaga, Takahiko; Araba, Kenza C; Kennedy, Meaghan M; Keith, Benjamin P; Wolber, Elisabeth A; Beasley, Caroline; Steinbach, Erin C; Schaner, Matthew R; Jain, Animesh; Long, Millie D; Barnes, Edward L; Herfarth, Hans H; Isaacs, Kim L; Hansen, Jonathan J; Kapadia, Muneera; Gaston Guillem, José; Koruda, Mark J; Rahbar, Reza; Sadiq, Tim; Gulati, Ajay S; Sethupathy, Praveen; Furey, Terrence S; Ehre, Camille; Sheikh, Shehzad Z",,96,25

Increasing the clinical utility of alcohol purchase tasks by expanding our definition of constraint,14.466559,7.9166794,2021,"A twin-column Multicolumn Countercurrent Solvent Gradient Purification (MCSGP) process has been developed for the purification of a therapeutic peptide, glucagon, from a crude synthetic mixture. This semi-continuous process uses two identical columns operating either in interconnected or in batch mode, thus enabling the internal recycle of the portions of the eluting stream which do not comply with purity specifications. Because of this feature, which actually results in the simulated countercurrent movement of the stationary phase with respect to the mobile one, the yield-purity trade-off typical of traditional batch preparative chromatography can be alleviated. Moreover, the purification process can be completely automatized. Aim of this work is to present a simple procedure for the development of the MCSGP process based on a single batch experiment, in the case of a therapeutic peptide of industrial relevance. This allowed to recover roughly 90% of the injected glucagon in a purified pool with a purity of about 90%. A comparison between the performance of the MCSGP process and the classical single column batch process indicates that percentage increase in the recovery of target product is +23% when transferring the method from batch conditions to MCSGP, with an unchanged purity of around 89%. This improvement comes at the expenses of a reduction of about 38% in productivity.","Luca, Chiara De; Felletti, Simona; Lievore, Giulio; Buratti, Alessandro; Vogg, Sebastian; Morbidelli, Massimo; Cavazzini, Alberto; Catani, Martina; Macis, Marco; Ricci, Antonio; Cabri, Walter",J Chromatogr A,96,1

How germline and somatic tissues are coordinated for the morphogenesis of each separated unit remains poorly understood. Here, using improved live imaging of Drosophila ovaries, we uncovered periodic actomyosin waves at the cortex of germ cells. These contractile waves are associated with pressure release blebs, which project from germ cells into somatic cells. We demonstrate that these cortical activities, together with cadherin-based adhesion, are required to sort each germline cyst as one collective unit. Genetic perturbations of cortical contractility, bleb protrusion, or adhesion between germline and somatic cells induced encapsulation defects resulting from failures to encapsulate any germ cells, or the inclusion of too many germ cells per egg chamber, or even the mechanical split of germline cysts. Live-imaging experiments revealed that reducing contractility or adhesion in the germline reduced the stiffness of germline cysts and their proper anchoring to the somatic cells. Germline cysts can then be squeezed and passively pushed by constricting surrounding somatic cells, resulting in cyst splitting and cyst collisions during encapsulation.

METHODS: Using data from a randomized controlled trial of subjects undergoing TKR for osteoarthritis, we assessed problematic MSK areas in six body regions before TKR and 12, 24, 36, and 48 months after TKR. We defined the following two variables: 1) density count (number of problematic MSK areas occurring after TKR; range 0-24) and 2) cumulative density count (problematic MSK areas both before and after TKR, categorized into four levels: no preoperative areas and density count of 0-1 [reference group]; no preoperative areas and density count of 2 or more; one or more preoperative areas and density count of 0-1; and one or more preoperative areas and density count of 2 or greater). We evaluated the associations between categorized 60-month WOMAC and cumulative density count by ordinal logistic regression. RESULTS: Among 230 subjects, 24% reported one or more preoperative problematic MSK area. After TKR, 75% reported a density count of 0 to 1; 25% reported a density count of 2 or more. Compared with the reference group, each cumulative density count category was associated with an increased odds of having a higher category of 60-month WOMAC pain score, as follows: 2.97 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.48-5.98) for no preoperative problematic areas and density count of 2 or greater, 3.31 (95% CI, 1.64-6.66) for one or more preoperative problematic areas and density count of 0 to 1, and 2.85 (95% CI, 0.97-8.39) for one or more preoperative problematic areas and density count of 2 or greater.

To prevent the virus from spreading to more individuals, it is of great importance to identify and isolate infected individuals through testing. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is the gold standard method for the diagnosis of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) worldwide. However, performing RT-qPCR is limited to centralized laboratories because of the need for sophisticated laboratory equipment and skilled personnel. Further, it can sometimes give false negative or uncertain results. Recently, new methods have been developed for nucleic acid detection and pathogen diagnosis using CRISPR-Cas systems. These methods present rapid and cost-effective diagnostic platforms that provide high sensitivity and specificity without the need for complex instrumentation. Using the CRISPR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection methods, it is possible to increase the number of daily tests in existing laboratories, reduce false negative or uncertain result rates obtained with RT-qPCR, and perform testing in resource-limited settings or at points of need where performing RT-qPCR is not feasible. Here, we briefly describe the RT-qPCR method, and discuss its limitations in meeting the current diagnostic needs. We explain how the unique properties of various CRISPR-associated enzymes are utilized for nucleic acid detection and pathogen diagnosis. Then, we highlight the important features of CRISPR-based diagnostic methods developed for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Finally, we examine the advantages and limitations of these methods, and discuss how they can contribute to improving the efficiency of the current testing systems for combating SARS-CoV-2.","Palaz, Fahreddin; Kalkan, Ali Kerem; Tozluyurt, Abdullah; Ozsoz, Mehmet",Clin Biochem,96,3

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective single-center cohort study including 64 patients with fragility hip fractures treated during the COVID-19 pandemic (March 1st-May 1st, 2020), compared to 172 patients treated in 2018 and 2019. Dedicated COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 circuits were established on March 14th. Patients treated before cohorting (17 patients), in COVID-19 (14 patients) and non-COVID-19 circuits (33 patients) were included. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were similar for 2018-19 and 2020. Patients in 2020 had a lower median surgical delay (50.5 vs. 91.3 h) and length of stay (9.0 vs. 14.0 days), while those with COVID-19, had longer surgical delays and length of stay (87.7 h and 15.0 days, respectively). Thirty-days mortality was higher among patients before cohorting, but similar in Covid-19 and non-Covid-19 pathways compared to 2018-19 (7.1% and 3.0% vs 5.2%, respectively). 23.5% of patients treated before circuiting suffered coronavirus infectious disease-19 disease after discharge. Following separation, no secondary cases of coronavirus infectious disease-19 were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Separate circuits for patients with and without coronavirus infectious disease-19 provided adequate hip fracture care. We did not observe increased mortality rates among hip fracture patients with preoperatively confirmed or suspected coronavirus infectious disease-19, compared to negative cases and 2018-19. Delaying surgery among patients with severe respiratory illness until a favourable trend could be observed did not lead to increased mortality.","Ojeda-Thies, Cristina; Cuarental-García, Javier; García-Gómez, Elena; Salazar-Zamorano, Carlos Hugo; Alberti-Maroño, Javier; Ramos-Pascua, Luis Rafael",,96,10

METHODS: Sixty pediatric patients admitted to the hospital between March 11, 2020 and April 15, 2020 with respiratory tract infections were evaluated retrospectively. Among them, 20 patients with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests and chest computed tomography (CT) examinations were included in the study. According to the RT-PCR test results, the patients were divided into the COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 groups. The clinical observations, laboratory results, and radiological features from the two groups were then compared. RESULTS: According to the RT-PCR test results, 12 patients were assigned to the COVID-19 group and 8 to the non-COVID-19 group. There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of clinical or laboratory features. In terms of radiological features, the presence of bronchiectasis and peribronchial thickening was statistically significantly higher in the non-COVID-19 group (P = 0.010 and P = 0.010, respectively).

Therefore, mental health promotion (MHP) initiatives are advocated. In 2014, the ABCs of mental health (ABCs) partnership was established in Denmark; in the partnership, partner organisations, e.g., municipalities and NGOs, use a research-based framework for MHP, the ABC-framework, to develop and implement MHP initiatives. This paper has two aims: (1) to outline the overall characteristics of these MHP initiatives; and (2) to explore local coordinator and stakeholder perceptions of the implementation processes and the impact of the MHP initiatives. Questionnaire surveys, individual interviews and group interviews were conducted during 2017-2020. The MHP initiatives were grouped according to three strategies: building MHP capacity, campaign activities to promote mental health awareness and knowledge and establishing and promoting opportunities to engage in mentally healthy activities. The ABC-framework was positively received and viewed as providing relevant knowledge for working with MHP as well as fostering intersectoral and interprofessional collaborations. However, using a bottom-up approach to develop and implement MHP initiatives can be time-consuming and resource demanding, and it requires a deliberate balancing of local adaptability and concrete guidance when engaging stakeholders and implementers. Overall, using the ABC-framework to develop and implement MHP initiatives holds great promise for advancing and promoting MHP practice.","Hinrichsen, Carsten; Koushede, Vibeke Jenny; Madsen, Katrine Rich; Nielsen, Line; Ahlmark, Nanna Gram; Santini, Ziggi Ivan; Meilstrup, Charlotte",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),96,20

We describe clinical presentation and diagnostic workup of acute myocarditis in a patient who had developed COVID-19 syndrome 1 month earlier. A healthy 40-year-old man suffered from typical COVID-19 symptoms. Four weeks later, he was admitted because of fever and tonsillitis. Blood tests showed major inflammation. Thoracic computed tomography was normal, and RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 on nasopharyngeal swab was negative. Because of haemodynamic worsening with both an increase in cardiac troponin and B-type natriuretic peptide levels and normal electrocardiogram, acute myocarditis was suspected. Cardiac echographic examination showed left ventricular ejection fraction at 45%. Exhaustive diagnostic workup included RT-PCR and serologies for infectious agents and autoimmune blood tests as well as cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and endomyocardial biopsies. Cardiac magnetic resonance with T2 mapping sequences showed evidence of myocardial inflammation and focal lateral subepicardial late gadolinium enhancement. Pathological analysis exhibited interstitial oedema, small foci of necrosis, and infiltrates composed of plasmocytes, T-lymphocytes, and mainly CD163+ macrophages. These findings led to the diagnosis of acute lympho-plasmo-histiocytic myocarditis. There was no evidence of viral RNA within myocardium. The only positive viral serology was for SARS-CoV-2. The patient and his cardiac function recovered in the next few days without use of anti-inflammatory or antiviral drugs. This case highlights that systemic inflammation associated with acute myocarditis can be delayed up to 1 month after initial SARS-CoV-2 infection and can be resolved spontaneously.","Nicol, Martin; Cacoub, Lea; Baudet, Mathilde; Nahmani, Yoram; Cacoub, Patrice; Cohen-Solal, Alain; Henry, Patrick; Adle-Biassette, Homa; Logeart, Damien",ESC Heart Fail,96,1

The aim of this study was to perform a comprehensive evolutionary analysis to describe the human outbreak and the evolutionary rate of different genomic regions of SARS-CoV-2. The molecular evolution in nine genomic regions of SARS-CoV-2 was analyzed using three different approaches: phylogenetic signal assessment, emergence of amino acid substitutions, and Bayesian evolutionary rate estimation in eight successive fortnights since the virus emergence. All observed phylogenetic signals were very low and tree topologies were in agreement with those signals. However, after 4 months of evolution, it was possible to identify regions revealing an incipient viral lineage formation, despite the low phylogenetic signal since fortnight 3. Finally, the SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary rate for regions nsp3 and S, the ones presenting greater variability, was estimated as 1.37 × 10-3 and 2.19 × 10-3 substitution/site/year, respectively. In conclusion, results from this study about the variable diversity of crucial viral regions and determination of the evolutionary rate are consequently decisive to understand essential features of viral emergence. In turn, findings may allow the first-time characterization of the evolutionary rate of S protein, crucial for vaccine development.","Pereson, Matías J; Mojsiejczuk, Laura; Martínez, Alfredo P; Flichman, Diego M; Garcia, Gabriel H; Di Lello, Federico A",J. med. virol,96,1

Of the 561 participants, the mean scores on the physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS) were 46.36 ± 12.79 and 55.03 ± 8.73, and 5.73% reported the symptoms of PTSD. Lower PCS and MCS after an earthquake were associated with elderly age, physical illness, and low level of social support (P < .05). Meanwhile, PTSD was significantly associated with MCS. These findings showed that physical disease and psychological symptoms can adversely affect the HRQoL of survivors. Moreover, providing higher social support to survivors should be considered as a way to improve the HRQoL outcomes of survivors.","Zhang, Xi; Gao, Yuyang; Dai, Xuemei; Zhou, Jing; Yan, Liuqing; Hou, Furang; Yuan, Ping; Wen, Jin",Medicine (Baltimore),96,8

The surgical techniques and patient care protocols vary among hospitals. One of the variations is the age cut-off for SDR. We have been advocating SDR to be performed early - especially at ages 2 and 3. With this study, we are reporting the feasibility and parent-reported surgical outcomes of receiving SDR at an early age for the treatment of spastic diplegia. Objectives Our aim is to examine the safety and benefits of receiving SDR at the ages of 2 and 3 for the treatment of spastic diplegia. Methods The Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Washington University School of Medicine approved this retrospective quality of life survey and chart review (approval #202009056). The subjects of this study were children and teens (ages: 3.9-18.1) with spastic diplegic cerebral palsy who underwent SDR at ages 2 or 3 between years 2005 and 2019 at St. Louis Children’s Hospital. Only domestic patients that were minors at the time of the study were selected to be participants in compliance with IRB regulations to protect patient health information that could potentially be breached by sending information to an incorrect or dated email. Thus, all contact was made through postal mail. The study included 141 patients from a total of 362 eligible patients. Parents of eligible patients were sent the research survey via postal mail. Only patients who responded to the survey were included in this study. The survey included questions on demographic information, quality of life, health perception, motor and ambulatory functions, braces and orthotics, pain issues, side effects of SDR, and post-SDR treatment. Results The study included 141 diplegic patients. Of all patients at the time of the study, 91% reported an improvement in walking, 92% in standing, and 89% in sitting. In daily life activities, 87% of patients became more independent after SDR. 65% of patients were able to walk without a walking aid and about 4% were not able to walk. 11% of all patients relied mostly on a wheelchair. Moreover, 43% of patients were able to run independently. Regarding post-SDR orthopedic surgery, 48% of patients received at least one type of orthopedic surgery, with Achilles tendon lengthening, hamstring lengthening, and calf muscle release being the most common types. Conclusions SDR performed at an early age through a single-level laminectomy was proved feasible and safe. A follow-up until the adult age (18 years) showed improvements in walking and other motor functions. The results support the implementation of early-age SDR for the treatment of spastic diplegia.","Park, TS; Joh, Susan; Walter, Deanna M; Meyer, Nicole L",Cureus,96,22

However, little is known about the genetic co-variation of viruses and different populations of the same bat species, although such information is needed for an understanding of virus transmission dynamics within a given host species. We hypothesized that if virus transmission between host populations depends on events linked to gene flow in the bats, genetic co-variation should exist between host populations and astroviruses. RESULTS: We used 19 nuclear and one mitochondrial microsatellite loci to analyze the genetic population structure of the Natterer’s bat (Myotis nattereri) within and among populations at different geographical scales in Germany. Further, we correlated the observed bat population structure to that of partial astrovirus sequences (323–394 nt fragments of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene) obtained from the same bat populations. Our analyses revealed that the studied bat colonies can be grouped into three distinct genetic clusters, corresponding to the three geographic regions sampled. Furthermore, we observed an overall isolation-by-distance pattern, while no significant pattern was observed within a geographic region. Moreover, we found no correlation between the genetic distances among the bat populations and the astrovirus sequences they harbored. Even though high genetic similarity of some of the astrovirus haplotypes found in several different regions was detected, identical astrovirus haplotypes were not shared between different sampled regions. CONCLUSIONS: The genetic population structure of the bat host suggests that mating sites where several local breeding colonies meet act as stepping-stones for gene flow. Identical astrovirus haplotypes were not shared between different sampled regions suggesting that astroviruses are mostly transmitted among host colonies at the local scale. Nevertheless, high genetic similarity of some of the astrovirus haplotypes found in several different regions implies that occasional transmission across regions with subsequent mutations of the virus haplotypes does occur.

The activity was influenced, possibly indirectly, by the length of prior treatment of infected cells with actinomycin D; however, 6 μg/ml actinomycin D and 10−5 M α-amanitin in the RDRP assay had no effect. The replication complex was membrane-bound and Mg2+ was essential for RDRP activity. Incorporation was more dependent on exogenous UTP and GTP than ATP or CTP. The specific activity was low, and rate of incorporation of GMP decreased as the period of assay was increased; however, incorporation of label lasted for at least 60 min. RNA products were fractionated by LiCl precipitation, and kinetic studies showed that the sequence of accumulation of label was the same as that observed in vivo, viz., RI → RF → 44 S RNA; limited reinitiation was also observed. This sequence of labeling also indicated that the in vitro RDRP activity was due to an enzyme capable of elongation, release, and reinitiation of Kunjin RNA synthesis and not merely end labeling or elongating preexisting RNA molecules. No labeled bands in urea-polyacrylamide gels were observed using extracts from mock-infected cells and hence the three RNA products of assays were readily identified in a single gel. The replication complex was still active after treatment with nonionic detergent, but no labeled 44 S RNA was detected in gels, even in the presence of RNasin in the assay which inhibited some nuclease activity. Antibodies to flavivirus-specific nonstructural proteins were preincubated with infected cell extracts in the presence and absence of detergent but no inhibition of RDRP activity was observed. However, anti-dsRNA plus detergent blocked activity by as much as 78% and label was found only in RF.","Chu, P.W.G.; Westaway, E. G.",Virology,96,6

CASE SERIES: Eleven recovered COVID‐19 patients were screened to donate CCP. All had molecularly confirmed COVID‐19, and all but one were antibody positive by chemiluminescence immunoassay (DiaSorin) prior to vaccination. All were tested again for antibodies 11–21 days after they were vaccinated (Pfizer/Moderna). All showed dramatic increases (~50‐fold) in spike‐specific antibody levels and had at least a 20‐fold increase in the IC50 neutralizing antibody titer based on plaque reduction neutralization testing (PRNT). The spike‐specific antibody levels following vaccination were significantly higher than those seen in any non‐vaccinated COVID‐19 subjects tested to date at our facility. CONCLUSION: Spike‐specific and neutralizing antibodies demonstrated dramatic increases following a single vaccination after COVID‐19 infection, which significantly exceeded values seen with COVID‐19 infection alone.

Methods SARS-CoV-2 infection was diagnosed by real-time PCR on naso-pharingeal swabs (NPS). T-cell response to structural antigens Spike (S), Envelope (E), Membrane (M) and Nucleocapsid (N) was evaluated by PBMC stimulation with overlapping peptides spanning the entire viral proteins and subsequent detection of cell activation markers CD137 and CD25. Serum IgG antibody to S and N, and IgA antibody to S were determined by ELISA. Results Three patients developed SARS-CoV-2 infection early (<3 months) and four patients late (>3 years) after Tx. One HR was asymptomatic, one LR presented only gastrointestinal symptoms, and five patients developed dyspnea with radiologic signs of interstitial pneumonia (in one HR ICU admittance was necessary. All patients recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection, with viral clearance from NPS within 3 weeks. However, two HR (one early and one late HR) died at 6 and 4 months after infection because of multi-organ failure and sudden death. Both deaths were considered as unrelated to SARS-CoV2 infection. Patients who had no lung involvement did not develop specific antibody response, while all the other five patients developed IgG and IgA antibodies to S, and IgG antibody to N, within 2 months after infection. All the symptomatic patients developed a detectable CD4+ T-cell response to two or more antigens. Four patients were subsequently examined >3 months after infection, showing the persistence of IgG and IgA antibodies to S and a decline of IgG antibody to N, while CD4+ T-cell response to N was maintained. Timing of Tx did not affect the occurrence of virus specific immunity. Conclusion Although this series is small, the data indicate that immunosuppression does not prevent the development of a specific humoral and cellular anti-SARS-CoV-2 response, more likely in patients who have experienced clinically relevant pneumonia. These preliminary data encourage the maintenance of regular follow-up to monitor the persistence of immune response and the potential occurrence of SARS-CoV-2-related sequelae in heart and lung recipients.","Seminari, E.; Abbate, T.; Arbustini, E.; Cattadori, B.; Di Matteo, A.; Gabanti, E.; Meloni, F.; Pellegrini, C.; Turco, A.; Zavaglio, F.; Lilleri, D.",The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation,96,9

Traditional drug discovery methods have a >90% failure rate and can take 10 to 15 y from target identification to clinical use. In contrast, drug repurposing can significantly accelerate translation. We developed a quantitative high-throughput screen to identify efficacious agents against SARS-CoV-2. From a library of 1,425 US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved compounds and clinical candidates, we identified 17 hits that inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection and analyzed their antiviral activity across multiple cell lines, including lymph node carcinoma of the prostate (LNCaP) cells and a physiologically relevant model of alveolar epithelial type 2 cells (iAEC2s). Additionally, we found that inhibitors of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway exacerbate SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. Notably, we discovered that lactoferrin, a glycoprotein found in secretory fluids including mammalian milk, inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection in the nanomolar range in all cell models with multiple modes of action, including blockage of virus attachment to cellular heparan sulfate and enhancement of interferon responses. Given its safety profile, lactoferrin is a readily translatable therapeutic option for the management of COVID-19.","Mirabelli, Carmen; Wotring, Jesse W.; Zhang, Charles J.; McCarty, Sean M.; Fursmidt, Reid; Pretto, Carla D.; Qiao, Yuanyuan; Zhang, Yuping; Frum, Tristan; Kadambi, Namrata S.; Amin, Anya T.; O’Meara, Teresa R.; Spence, Jason R.; Huang, Jessie; Alysandratos, Konstantinos D.; Kotton, Darrell N.; Handelman, Samuel K.; Wobus, Christiane E.; Weatherwax, Kevin J.; Mashour, George A.; O’Meara, Matthew J.; Chinnaiyan, Arul M.; Sexton, Jonathan Z.",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,96,20

An overall defined treatment has not yet been established. Therefore, it is important to summarize and report treatment experiences and identify patient groups that have a significantly higher risk of an adverse clinical outcome. Methods: Two hundred thirty-nine COVID-19 patients were recruited from January 25 to February 15, 2020. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, treatment management, and outcome data obtained from patients' medical records were evaluated. Results: Patients who recovered from PCR positive to negative within 2 weeks had significantly lower erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and higher C-reactive protein (CRP) levels than those recovered post 2 weeks. During antiviral treatment, COVID-19 patients with older age, comorbidities, and corticosteroid treatment required a significantly longer time to turn from PCR positive to negative COVID-19 result. Conclusion: PCR tests are of great importance to evaluate the recovery of COVID-19-positive patients, and ESR could be an indirect indicator to monitor SARS-COV-2 activity. Furthermore, our data suggest that older age, the existence of comorbidities, and corticosteroid treatment of COVID-19 patients during antiviral treatment could prolong the duration of conversion from SARS-COV-2 positive to negative.","Zhu, Sheng; Huang, Yaxiong; Tang, Wei; Nussler, Andreas K.; Zheng, Fang",Front Med (Lausanne),96,23

Methods - A retrospective study of all patients who underwent orthopaedic surgery in the month of July 2020 at a tertiary care orthopaedic speciality hospital in Bangalore, India. All patients underwent nasopharyngeal swab test before surgery. A questionnaire was used to assess the patient before the RT-PCR nasopharyngeal swab test. Data regarding imaging, investigations and follow up was recorded. Results - In the month of July 2020, 168 patients underwent routine nasopharyngeal RT -PCR swab test for COVID - 19 prior to planned orthopaedic surgical procedure (Both trauma and elective cases). 16 of the RT-PCR tests were positive. However vascular cases and absolute emergencies were done without a RT -PCR test with PPE and all universal precautions. 11 patients underwent emergency surgery without a RT-PCR test. All 16 cases who were positive were asymptomatic. The asymptomatic positive rate was 9.52%. Of the 11 patients who underwent emergency surgery without a RT-PCR test, only one patient had a positive test post - operatively. Conclusions - Routine nasopharyngeal RT-PCR testing revealed a high rate of asymptomatic cases. If the RT-PCR test is positive, it is best to defer the case till the test returns negative.

Using a recent de novo transcript assembly that captured previously unannotated transcripts, we describe a novel isoform of ACE2, generated by co-option of an intronic long terminal repeat (LTR) retroelement promoter. The novel transcript, termed LTR16A1-ACE2, exhibits specific expression patterns across the aerodigestive and gastrointestinal tracts and, importantly, is highly responsive to interferon stimulation. In stark contrast, expression of canonical ACE2 is completely unresponsive to interferon stimulation. Moreover, the LTR16A1-ACE2 translation product is a truncated, unstable ACE2 form, lacking domains required for SARS-CoV-2 binding and therefore unlikely to contribute to or enhance viral infection.","Ng, Kevin; Attig, Jan; Bolland, William; Young, George R.; Major, Jack; Wack, Andreas; Kassiotis, George",bioRxiv,96,1

Renal resistive index (RRI) is a noninvasive instrument to evaluate kidney hemodynamics, and it is obtained by analysis of intrarenal arterial waves using Doppler ultrasound. This study aimed to determine the role of RRI in predicting AKI and adverse outcomes in critically ill patients with COVID-19. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 65 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia admitted to the critical care unit from April 1, 2020, to June 20, 2020. Informed consent was obtained from all individual participants included in the study. Cardiac, pulmonary, and kidney ultrasonographic evaluations were performed in a protocolized way. RESULTS: In this cohort, 65 patients were included, mean age was 53.4 years, 79% were male, and 35% were diabetic. Thirty-four percent of patients developed AKI, 12% required RRT, and 35% died. Of the patients who developed AKI, 68% had RRI ≥ 0.7. Also, 75% of the patients who required RRT had RRI ≥ 0.7. In the adjusted Cox model, the RRI ≥ 0.7 was associated with higher mortality (HR 2.86, 95% CI: 1.19–6.82, p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Critical care ultrasonography is a noninvasive, reproducible, and accurate bedside method that has proven its usefulness.

Several treatments are currently being tested worldwide. This paper focuses on anti-malarial drugs such as chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine, which have been currently reviewed by a systematic study as a good potential candidate and that has been reported as the most used treatment by a recent survey of physicians. We compare the dynamics of COVID-19 death rates in countries using anti-malaria drugs as a treatment from the start of the epidemic versus countries that do not, the day of the 3rd death and the following 10 days. We show that the first group have a much slower dynamic in death rates that the second group. This univariate analysis is of course only one additional piece of evidence in the debate regarding the efficiency of anti-malaria drugs, and it is also limited as the two groups certainly have other systemic differences in the way they responded to the pandemic, in the way they report death or in their population that better explain differences in dynamics (systematic differences that may also explain their choice to rely on anti-malaria drugs in the first place). Nevertheless, the difference in dynamics is so striking that we believe that the urgency context commands presenting the univariate analysis before delving into further analysis. In the end, this data might ultimately be either a piece of evidence in favor or anti-malaria drugs or a stepping stone in understanding further what other ecological aspects place a role in the dynamics of COVID-19 deaths.","Izoulet, M.",,96,10

By applying this strategy to SARS-CoV-2 polyprotein-1ab, we predicted multiple labile Zn-sites in papain-like cysteine protease (PL(pro)), nsp10 transcription factor, and nsp13 helicase. These are attractive drug targets because they are highly conserved among coronaviruses and play vital structural/catalytic roles in viral proteins indispensable for virus replication. We show that five Zn-ejectors can release Zn(2+) from PL(pro) and nsp10, and clinically-safe disulfiram and ebselen can not only covalently bind to the Zn-bound cysteines in both proteins, but also inhibit PL(pro) protease.

CTA revealed critical (>50% lumen diameter narrowing) stenosis of the proximal anterior descending coronary, and the patient was scheduled for invasive coronary angiography (ICA). Before ICA he underwent enhanced transthoracic echo-Doppler (E-Doppler TTE) for coronary flow detection by color-guided pulsed-wave Doppler recording of the left main (LMCA) and whole left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD,) along with coronary flow reserve (CFR) in the distal LAD calculated as the ratio, of peak flow velocity during i.v. adenosine (140 mcg/Kg/m) to resting flow velocity. E-Doppler TTE mapping revealed only mild stenosis (28% area narrowing) of the mid LAD and a CFR of 3.20, in perfect agreement with the color mapping showing no flow limiting stenosis in the LMCA and LAD.

The evolution and mutational events of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes are critical for controlling virulence, transmissibility, infectivity, severity of symptoms and mortality associated to this infectious disease. We collected and investigated 309 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from patients infected in France. Detailed genome cartography of all mutational events (SNPs, indels) was reported and correlated to clinical features of patients. A comparative analysis between our 309 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from French patients and the reference Wuhan coronavirus genome revealed 315 substitution mutations and six deletion events: ten were in 5’/3’ UTR, 178 were nonsynonymous, 126 were synonymous and one generated a stop codon. Six different deleted areas were also identified in nine viral variants. In particular, 30 substitution mutations (18 nonsynonymous) and one deletion (Δ21765-21770) concerned the spike S glycoprotein. An average of 7.8 mutational events (+/- 1.7 SD) and a median of 8 (range, 7-9) were reported per viral isolate. Comparative analyses and clustering of specific mutational signatures in 309 genomes disclose several divisions in groups and subgroups combining their geographical and phylogenetic origin. Clinical outcomes of the 309 COVID-19-infected patients were investigated according to the mutational signatures of viral variants. These findings highlight the genome dynamics of the coronavirus 2019-20 and shed light on the mutational landscape and evolution of this virus. Inclusion of the French cohort enabled us to identify 161 novel mutations never reported in SARS-CoV-2 genomes collected worldwide. These results support a global and continuing surveillance of the emerging variants of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.","Levasseur, Anthony; Delerce, Jeremy; Caputo, Aurelia; Brechard, Ludivine; Colson, Philippe; Lagier, Jean-Christophe; Fournier, Pierre-Edouard; Raoult, Didier",bioRxiv,96,16

The inflammatory response to COVID-19 infection in children remains poorly characterised. METHODS: We retrospectively analysed the medical records of 127 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients aged 1 month to 16 years from Wuhan and Jingzhou of Hubei Province. Patients presented between January 25th and March 24th 2020. Information on clinical features, laboratory results, plasma cytokines/chemokines and lymphocyte subsets were analysed. FINDINGS: Children admitted to hospital with COVID-19 were more likely to be male (67.7%) and the median age was 7.3 [IQR 4.9] years. All but one patient with severe disease was aged under 2 and the majority (5/7) had significant co-morbidities. Despite 53% having viral pneumonia on computed tomography (CT) scanning only 2 patients had low lymphocyte counts and no differences were observed in the levels of plasma proinflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-6, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)- [Formula: see text] , and interferon (IFN)- [Formula: see text] between patients with mild, moderate or severe disease. INTERPRETATIONS: We observed that the immune responses of children to COVID-19 infection is significantly different from that seen in adults. Our evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 does not trigger a robust inflammatory response or ‘cytokine storm’ in children with COVID-19, and this may underlie the generally better outcomes seen in children with this disease.","Qian, Guoqing; Zhang, Yong; Xu, Yang; Hu, Weihua; Hall, Ian P.; Yue, Jiang; Lu, Hongyun; Ruan, Liemin; Ye, Maoqing; Mei, Jin",EClinicalMedicine,96,24

Here, using atomistic simulation, a plausible mechanism has been delineated. In G614 sgp but not wild type, increased D(G)614‐T859 Cα‐distance within 65 ns is interpreted as S1/S2 protomer dissociation. Overall, ACE2‐binding, post‐fusion core, open‐state and sub‐optimal antibody‐binding conformations were preferentially sampled by the G614 mutant, but not wild type. Furthermore, in the wild type, only one of the three sgp chains has optimal communication route between residue 614 and the receptor‐binding domain (RBD); whereas, two of the three chains communicated directly in G614 mutant. These data provide evidence that D614G sgp mutant is more available for receptor binding, cellular invasion and reduced antibody interaction; thus, providing framework for enhanced fitness and higher transmissibility in D614G SARS‐COV‐2 mutant.","Omotuyi, I.

Collection of nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS), the preferred sample type for SARS-CoV-2 detection, has become difficult due to the dramatic increase in testing and consequential supply strain. Therefore, alternative specimen types have been investigated, that provide similar detection sensitivity with reduced health care exposure and potential for self-collection. In this study, the detection sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 in nasal swabs (NS) and saliva was compared to that of NPS, using matched specimens from two outpatient cohorts in New York State (total n = 463). The first cohort showed only a 5.4% positivity but the second cohort (n=227) had a positivity rate of 41%, with sensitivity in NPS, NS and saliva of 97.9%, 87.1%, and 87.1%, respectively. Whether the reduced sensitivity of NS or saliva is acceptable must be assessed in the settings where they are used. However, we sought to improve on it by validating a method to mix the two sample types, as the combination of nasal swab and saliva resulted in 94.6% SARS-CoV-2 detection sensitivity. Spiking experiments showed that combining them did not adversely affect the detection sensitivity in either. Virus stability in saliva was also investigated, with and without the addition of commercially available stabilizing solutions. The virus was stable in saliva at both 4C and room temperature for up to 7 days. The addition of stabilizing solutions did not enhance stability and in some situations reduced detectable virus levels.","Griesemer, S.

This report summarizes development of a remdesivir physiologically‐based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model that accurately describes observed adult remdesivir and metabolites exposure and predicts pediatric remdesivir and metabolites exposure. The adult PBPK model was applied to predict pediatric remdesivir and metabolites steady‐state exposures using the Pediatric Population Model in SimCYP and incorporated the relevant physiologic and mechanistic information. Model development was based on adult phase I exposure data in healthy volunteers who were administered a 200‐mg loading dose of remdesivir intravenous (IV) over 0.5 hours on Day 1, then 100‐mg daily maintenance doses of IV over 0.5 hours starting on Day 2 and continuing through Days 5 or 10. Simulations indicated that use of the adult therapeutic remdesivir dosage regimen (200‐mg loading dose on Day 1 then 100‐mg daily maintenance dose starting on Day 2) in pediatric patients ≥ 40 kg and a weight‐based remdesivir dosage regimen (5‐mg/kg loading dose on Day 1 then 2.5‐mg/kg daily maintenance dose starting on Day 2) in pediatric patients weighing 2.5 to < 40 kg is predicted to maintain therapeutic exposures of remdesivir and its metabolites.

The study of pathogen transmission in wildlife is challenging, but it is unquestionably key to understand how epidemiological interactions occur at the wildlife-domestic-human interface. In this context, studying parasite avoidance behaviours may provide essential insights on parasite transmission, host-parasite coevolution, and energy flow through food-webs. However, the strategies of avoiding trophically transmitted parasites in mammalian carnivores have received little scientific attention. Here, we explore the behaviour of red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) and other mammalian carnivores at conspecific and heterospecific carnivore carcasses using videos recorded by camera traps. We aim to determine 1) the factors influencing the probability of foxes to practice cannibalism, and 2) whether the scavenging behaviour of foxes differ when facing conspecific vs. heterospecific carcasses. We found that red foxes were generally reluctant to consume mesocarnivore carrion, especially of conspecifics. When recorded, consumption by foxes was delayed several days (heterospecific carcasses) or weeks (conspecific carcasses) after carcass detection. Other mammalian scavengers showed a similar pattern. Also, meat-borne parasite transmission from wild carnivore carcasses to domestic dogs and cats was highly unlikely. Our findings challenge the widespread assumption that cannibalistic or intra-specific scavenging is a major transmission route for Trichinella spp. and other meat-borne parasites, especially for the red fox. Overall, our results suggest that the feeding decisions of scavengers are probably shaped by two main contrasting forces, namely the nutritional reward provided by carrion of phylogenetically similar species and the risk of acquiring meat-borne parasites shared with these species. This study illustrates how the detailed monitoring of carnivore behaviour is essential to assess the epidemiological role of these hosts in the maintenance and dispersion of parasites of public and animal health relevance.","Gonzálvez, Moisés; Martínez-Carrasco, Carlos; Sánchez-Zapata, José A.; Moleón, Marcos",Appl Anim Behav Sci,96,3

However, there is limited data on the efficacy of virucidal products against EBOV, because the virus has a high biosafety level and is only available in a few laboratories worldwide. The virucidal efficacy of antiseptics and disinfectants can be determined using the European Standard EN14476:2013/FprA1:2015. Modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) was introduced in 2014 as a reference virus for the claim ‘virucidal active against enveloped viruses for hygienic hand rub and hand wash’. For EBOV, also an enveloped virus, the suitability of MVA as a surrogate needs to be proven. The aim of this study was to test the in vitro efficacy of four povidone iodine (PVP-I) formulations against EBOV: 4 % PVP-I skin cleanser; 7.5 % PVP-I surgical scrub; 10 % PVP-I solution; and 3.2 % PVP-I and 78 % alcohol solution. The formulations were tested with MVA to define the test conditions, and as a secondary objective the suitability of MVA as a surrogate for enveloped viruses like EBOV was assessed. METHODS: According to EN14476, a standard suspension test was used for MVA. Large-volume plating was used for EBOV to increase test sensitivity and exclude potential after-effects. All products were tested under clean (0.3 g/L BSA) and dirty (3.0 g/L BSA + 3.0 mL/L erythrocytes) conditions with MVA for 15, 30, and 60 s. The concentration-contact time values obtained with MVA were verified for EBOV. RESULTS: Viral titres of MVA and EBOV were reduced by >99.99 % to >99.999 % under clean and dirty conditions after application of the test products for 15 seconds. CONCLUSIONS: All products showed excellent virucidal efficacy against EBOV, demonstrating the important role PVP-I can play in helping to prevent and limit the spread of Ebola virus disease. The efficacy against both test viruses after 15 s is helpful information for the implementation of guidance for people potentially exposed to EBOV, and confirms the excellent virucidal efficacy of PVP-I against enveloped viruses. MVA was found to be a suitable surrogate for enveloped viruses like EBOV.","Eggers, Maren; Eickmann, Markus; Kowalski, Katharina; Zorn, Juergen; Reimer, Karen",BMC Infect Dis,96,16

To better recognise the trends and characteristics of toxocariasis research, this study is a bibliometric analysis of the global toxocariasis research. METHODS: Searches were completed on April 5, 2016, using the Scopus database. A search without any language restriction was performed to extract publications dealing with toxocariasis. Terms related to toxocariasis were used to perform a title keyword search. RESULTS: A total of 2765 publications comprising 11 document types and published between 1932 and 2015 were included in the analysis. Articles were the most popular document form, accounting for 83.62% of all publications, followed by letters (3.80%) and reviews (3.4%). The annual number of research publications increased from 30 in 1980 to 111 in 2015, indicating that the number of publications on toxocariasis has increased slowly over the past 35 years. The United States of America and Japan are the predominant countries of origin, with 303 articles and 207 articles, respectively, followed by Brazil and the United Kingdom, with 180 (6.5%) each. The h-index for all the publications was 60. The highest h-index were for publications from the United Kingdom (h-index value = 43) and the United States (h-index value = 39); these two countries were also involved with the highest number of international collaborations, with 27 and 28 countries, respectively.

We evaluated the incidence, complications, and management of FBSs in patients undergoing endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The medical records of patients who underwent ERCP procedures at the Gastroenterology Endoscopy Department of Kocaeli University Medical Faculty from December 2016 to December 2020 were analysed retrospectively. Data on patient characteristics, indications for ERCP and stenting, stent types, stenting duration, and complications were obtained from the hospital?s database. RESULTS: A total of 48 cases with FBSs were analysed. The mean age (SD) of the patients was 71.23 years (12.165), the male to female ratio was 23/25 (0.92), and the mean stenting duration was 27.12 (range: 12?84) months. The most common indication for biliary stenting was irretrievable choledochal stones (40/48). Among the FBS patients in whom ERCP was performed, the most common presenting condition was cholangitis (22/34). Stone formation (79%) and proximal stent migration (26.4%) were the most frequent complications. The patients in the FBS group were significantly older than those in whom stents were removed in a timely manner (71.23 vs. 62.43 years, p < 0.001). Endoscopic treatment was possible in all cases; surgery was not required in any case. The most common cause of FBSs cited by patients was not having been informed about the need for long-term management of their stents (n = 14, 29.2%) Conclusion: FBSs are potentially problematic, particularly in older patients. Communication with the patient to remind them of the need for stent management is important for preventing FBSs.","Duman, Ali Erkan; Yilmaz, Hasan; Hülagü, Sadettin",Turkish journal of medical sciences,96,1

We reviewed mathematical models for contact tracing and follow-up control measures of SARS and MERS transmission. Model characteristics, epidemiological parameters and intervention parameters used in the mathematical models from seven studies were summarized. A major concern identified in future epidemics is whether public health administrators can collect all the required data for building epidemiological models in a short period of time during the early phase of an outbreak.

A rapid review of published systematic reviews on HIV/AIDS and mental health outcomes and responses among children and adolescents was used to identify lessons for the COVID-19 pandemic response. The review found that HIV/AIDS responses to promote mental health, prevent ill-health and treat mental health conditions included diverse interventions at the structural or national, community, household and individual levels. Some of these responses can be easily replicated, others require substantial adaptation, and some can inform development of new innovative offline and online responses to mitigate impact of COVID-19 on mental health of children and adolescents. Programs that mitigate economic impacts including child grants, income generating activities for caregivers, food distribution, health care vouchers, and other economic empowerment interventions can be replicated with minor adjustments. Helplines for vulnerable or abused children and shelters for victims of gender-based violence can be scaled up to respond to the COVID pandemic, with minimal adaptation to adhere to prevention of contagion. Mass media campaigns to combat stigma and discrimination were successfully employed in the HIV response, and similar interventions could be developed and applied in the COVID context. Some programs will need more substantial adjustments. In health facilities, mainstreaming child-sensitive mental health training of frontline workers and task sharing/shifting to community volunteers and social workers as was done for HIV with community health workers, could advance mental illness detection, particularly among abuse victims, but requires adaptation of protocols. At the community and household levels, expansion of parenting programs can help caregivers navigate negative mental health effects on children, however, these are not often operating at scale, nor well-linked to services. Programs requiring innovation include converting adolescent and youth safe physical spaces into virtual spaces particularly for at-risk girls and young women; organizing virtual community support groups, conversations, and developing online resources. Re-opening of schools and introduction of health and hygiene policies, provides another opportunity for innovation - to provide mental health and psychosocial support to all children as a standard package of care and practice.","Banati, Prerna; Idele, Priscilla",Front Psychiatry,96,16

Nevertheless, techniques for quantitative assessment of the edema’s severity and dynamics are absent in clinical practice, and the analysis is mainly limited to physical examination. This fact stimulates the development of novel methods for fast and reliable diagnostics of fluid retention in tissues. In this work, we focused on the possibilities of two microscopic techniques, nailfold video capillaroscopy (NVC) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), in the assessment of the short-term and long-term cutaneous edema. We showed that for the patients with HF, morphological parameters obtained by NVC—namely, the apical diameter of capillaries and the size of the perivascular zone—indicate long-term edema. On the other hand, for healthy volunteers, the application of two models of short-term edema, venous occlusion, and histamine treatment of the skin, did not reveal notable changes in the capillary parameters. However, a significant reduction of the NVC image sharpness was observed in this case, which was suggested to be due to water accumulation in the epidermis. To verify these findings, we made use of CLSM, which provides the skin structure with cellular resolution. It was observed that for the histamine-treated skin, the areas of the dermal papillae become hyporefractive, leading to the loss of contrast and the lower visibility of capillaries. Similar effect was observed for patients undergoing infusion therapy. Collectively, our results reveal the parameters can be used for pericapillary edema assessment using the NVC and CLSM, and paves the way for their application in a clinical set-up.","Yakimov, Boris P.; Gurfinkel, Yury I.; Davydov, Denis A.; Allenova, Anastasia S.; Budylin, Gleb S.; Vasiliev, Vladimir Yu.; Soldatova, Vera Yu.; Kamalov, Armais A.; Matskeplishvili, Simon T.; Priezzhev, Alexander V.; Shirshin, Evgeny A.",Diagnostics (Basel),96,16

This is a pilot study of remote coaching and assessment of Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS) manual skills in obstetrics and gynecology residents. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PGY-3 obstetrics and gynecology residents participated in remote assessment of FLS manual skills using a live streaming platform. Learners who showed deficiencies in proficiency participated in live-streamed coaching sessions. The coaching sessions continued until the learner and coach mutually agreed that the learner was prepared for the skills portion of the FLS certification exam. The primary outcome was learner performance on skills assessment with external validation through the FLS manual skills exam pass rate. RESULTS: One learner demonstrated proficiency at baseline and the remaining nine underwent remote coaching sessions. Learners received a mean of two coaching sessions to reach mutually agreed readiness for the FLS exam as per learner and coach. All residents performed significantly better at the conclusion of the remote coaching series (11.3 ± 0.82) as compared to their baseline scores (8.8 ± 2.82) (P < .03; 95% CI, 0.31-4.69). Proficiency was externally validated through the FLS exam taken by each resident 1-2 weeks following their final assessment, with all learners passing the manual portion. The average satisfaction of learners with remote coaching was 77/100 (range 50-100). 100% of learners felt prepared for their FLS certification exam and 100% would recommend this remote training program to a colleague. CONCLUSION: Remote coaching and assessment of FLS skills yields similar results to traditional face-to-face instruction.","Miles, Shana; Donnellan, Nicole",Mil Med,96,28

In this situation, the travelers’ decision-making for tourism destinations was heavily affected by this global event. Social media usage has played an essential role in travelers’ decision-making and increased the awareness of travel-related risks from the COVID-19 outbreak. Online consumer media for the outbreak of COVID-19 has been a crucial source of information for travelers. In the current situation, tourists are using electronic word of mouth (eWOM) more and more for travel planning. Opinions provided by peer travelers for the outbreak of COVID-19 tend to reduce the possibility of poor decisions. Nevertheless, the increasing number of reviews per experience makes reading all feedback hard to make an informed decision. Accordingly, recommendation agents developed by machine learning techniques can be effective in the analysis of such social big data for the identification of useful patterns from the data, knowledge discovery, and real-time service recommendations. The current research aims to adopt a framework for the recommendation agents through topic modeling to uncover the most important dimensions of COVID-19 reviews in the Netherland forums in TripAdvisor. This study demonstrates how social networking websites and online reviews can be effective in unexpected events for travelers’ decision making.

Lonely individuals are more likely to resort to social media for instantaneous comfort, but it is not a perpetual solution. Largely negative implications including poorer interpersonal relationship and depression were reported due to excessive social media usage. Conversational task is an established intervention to improve verbal communication, cognitive and behavioral adaptation among lonely individuals. Despite that behavioral benefits have been reported, it is unclear if they are accompanied by objective benefits underlying physiological changes. Here, we investigate the physiological signals from 28 healthy individuals during a conversational task. Participants were ranked by trait extraversion, where greater introversion is associated with increased susceptibility to perceived social isolation as compared to participants with greater extraversion as controls. We found that introverts had a greater tendency to be neurotic, and these participants also exhibited significant differences in task-related electrodermal activity (EDA), heart rate (HR) and HR variability (HRV) as compared to controls. Notably, resting state HRV among individuals susceptible to perceived loneliness was below the healthy thresholds established in literature. Conversational task with a stranger significantly increased HRV among individuals susceptible to isolation up to levels as seen in controls. Since HRV is also elevated by physical exercise and administration of oxytocin hormone (one form of therapy for behavioral isolation), conversational therapy among introverts could potentially confer physiological benefits to ameliorate social isolation and loneliness. Our findings also suggest that although the recent pandemic has changed how people are interacting typically, we should maintain a healthy dose of social interaction innovatively.","Feng, Ying Xing; Roslan, Nur Syahirah; Izhar, Lila Iznita; Abdul Rahman, Muhammad; Faye, Ibrahima; Ho, Eric Tatt Wei",Int J Environ Res Public Health,96,17

We identify a group of patients with penetrating bladder injury who were treated with minimally invasive management and compare the results with those who underwent traditional open surgical treatment. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study analyzes penetrating bladder injuries from a single trauma center from 2012 through 2019, and from the National Trauma Data Bank for 2016 and 2017. Mortality, complications, and length of stay were compared for minimally invasive management versus open surgery. We used Chi square to test significance for categorical variables, Mann-Whitney U test for ordinal variables, and T-test for continuous variables. Multivariate analysis was performed with multiple logistic, ordinal, and linear regression. RESULTS: Local: 117 (0.63%) had a bladder injury; 30 (25.6%) were penetrating. 6 (20.0%) were successfully treated with minimally invasive management with no complication versus 24 complications in 11 patients (45.8%) for open surgery (p = 0.047). Open surgical management was not a significant independent predictor of mortality or hospital length of stay. National Trauma Data Bank: 5330 (0.27%) had a bladder injury; 963 (19.5%) were penetrating. 97 (10.1%) were treated with minimally invasive management. The minimally invasive management group had 12 complications in 5 patients (4.9%) versus 280 complications in 169 patients (19.7%) for open surgery (p = < 0.001). Open surgery was a significant independent predictor of complications (OR 1.57, p = 0.003) and longer hospital length of stay (B = 5.31, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Most penetrating bladder injury requires open surgery, however a small proportion can safely be managed with minimally invasive management. Minimally invasive management is associated with lower total complications and shorter hospital length of stay in select patients.","Culhane, John; Syed, Johar Raza; Siddiqui, Sameer",BMC Urol,96,10

However, in the presence of containment measures, the exponential model becomes less appropriate. Under the implementation of an isolation measure for detected infectives, we propose to model epidemic dynamics by fitting a flexible growth model curve to reported positive cases and to infer the overall epidemic dynamics by introducing information on the detection/testing effort and recovery and death rates. The resulting modeling approach is close to the SIQR (Susceptible- Infectious-Quarantined-Recovered) model framework. We focused on predicting the peaks (time and size) in positive cases, actives cases and new infections. We applied the approach to data from the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy.

With the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, wildlife agencies were concerned whether the activities they authorize might increase the risk of viral transmission from humans to North American bats but had a limited amount of time in which to make decisions. We provide a description of how decision analysis provides a powerful framework to analyze and re-analyze complex natural resource management problems as knowledge evolves. Coupled with expert judgment and avenues for the rapid release of information, risk assessment can provide timely scientific information for evolving decisions. In April 2020, the first rapid risk assessment was conducted to evaluate the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from humans to North American bats. Based on the best available information, and relying heavily on formal expert judgment, the risk assessment found a small possibility of transmission during summer work activities. Following that assessment, additional knowledge and data emerged, such as bat viral challenge studies, that further elucidated the risks of human-to-bat transmission and culminated in a second risk assessment in the fall of 2020. We update the first SARS-CoV-2 risk assessment with new estimates of little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus) susceptibility and new management alternatives, using findings from the prior two risk assessments and other empirical studies. We highlight the strengths of decision analysis and expert judgment not only to frame decisions and produce useful science in a timely manner, but also to serve as a framework to reassess risk as understanding improves. For SARS-CoV-2 risk, new knowledge led to an 88% decrease in the median number of bats estimated to be infected per 1000 encountered when compared to earlier results. The use of facemasks during, or a negative COVID-19 test prior to, bat encounters further reduced those risks. Using a combination of decision analysis, expert judgment, rapid risk assessment, and efficient modes of information distribution, we provide timely science support to decision makers for summer bat work in North America.","Cook, Jonathan D.; Campbell Grant, Evan H.; Coleman, Jeremy T.

There is uncertainty regarding the feasibility and acceptability of symptom perception support and doubts regarding how to include informal caregivers. This study aims to test the feasibility, acceptability and outcome responsiveness of an intervention supporting symptom perception in persons with HF and their informal caregiver. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A feasibility study with a quasi-experimental pretest and post-test single group design is conducted. The convenience sample consists of 30 persons with HF, their informal caregivers and six nurses. SYMPERHEART is an evidence-informed intervention that targets symptom perception by educational and support components. Feasibility is measured by time-to-recruit; time-to-deliver; eligibility rate; intervention delivery fidelity rate. Acceptability is measured by rate of consent, retention rate, treatment acceptability and the engagement in the intervention components. Outcome responsiveness includes: HF self-care (via the Self-care of Heart Failure Index V.7.2); perception of HF symptom burden (via the Heart Failure Somatic Perception Scale V.3); health status (via the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire-12); caregivers’ contribution to HF self-care (via the Caregiver Contribution to Self-Care of Heart Failure Index 2); caregivers’ burden (via the Zarit Burden Interview).

In this article, we report on disease burden and drug prescription patterns in a large refugee cohort in Germany. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of anonymized medical records including demographic data, diagnoses, and drug prescriptions in two refugee reception centres between 2015 and 2019. Refugees and migrants received medical assistance exclusively through the on-site clinics. Thus, this study represents all medical visits of the housed residents. RESULTS: In total, n = 15531 diagnoses from n = 4858 patients in a cohort of n = 10431 accommodated refugees were recorded. N = 11898 medications were prescribed. Overall, 29.8% of all refugees sought medical attention. Half of the patients were female (49.6%), the average age was 23.8 years (SD [standard deviation] 17.0, min 0, max 81), and 41.5% were minors (<18 years). Most patients had Middle Eastern or Northern African origin (63.9%). The largest proportion of diagnoses belonged to the ICD (International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems) category “R” (miscellaneous, 33.5%), followed by diseases of the respiratory system (category “J”, 16.5%), or the musculoskeletal system (category “M”, 7.1%).

We systematically reviewed the literature, identified studies that matched predetermined selection criteria, and performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the proportion of males among four disease severity categories. Appropriate assessment strategies were implemented to assess and minimize potential biases. The results of this meta-analysis indicated that males constituted a significantly higher proportion of those who had adverse clinical outcomes and died from COVID-19. As the coronavirus spread from the East to the West, male sex remained a consistent risk factor. Our results support the establishment of the male sex as an important risk factor for this disease. Early identification and appropriate medical care for males with lab-confirmed COVID-19 may substantially change the course of clinical prognosis, resulting in greater numbers of lives saved.","Galbadage, Thushara; Peterson, Brent M.; Awada, Joseph; Buck, Alison S.; Ramirez, Danny A.; Wilson, Jason; Gunasekera, Richard S.",Front Med (Lausanne),96,20

Here, we report a 51-year-old healthy man with nephrotic syndrome secondary to minimal change disease (MCD) after Ad26.COV.2 (Janssen) vaccination. He had no comorbid disease and received Ad26.COV.2 on April 13, 2021. Seven days after vaccination, he developed edema and foamy urine. Edema rapidly aggravated with decreased urine volume. He was admitted to the hospital 28 days after vaccination, and his body weight increased by 21 kg after vaccination. His serum creatinine level was 1.54 mg/dL, and 24-h urinary protein excretion was 8.6 g/day. Kidney biopsy revealed no abnormality in the glomeruli and interstitium of the cortex and medulla under the light microscope. Electron microscopy revealed diffuse effacement of the podocyte foot processes, thus, he was diagnosed with MCD. High-dose steroid therapy was applied, and his kidney function improved three days after steroid therapy. Three weeks after steroid use, his serum creatinine decreased to 0.95 mg/dL, and spot urine protein-to-creatine decreased to 0.2 g/g. This case highlights the risk of new-onset nephrotic syndrome secondary to MCD after vectored COVID-19 vaccination. Although the pathogenesis is uncertain, clinicians need to be careful about adverse renal effects of COVID-19 vaccines.","Lim, Jeong-Hoon; Han, Man-Hoon; Kim, Yong-Jin; Kim, Mee-Seon; Jung, Hee-Yeon; Choi, Ji-Young; Cho, Jang-Hee; Kim, Chan-Duck; Kim, Yong-Lim; Park, Sun-Hee",J Korean Med Sci,96,8

The site of predilection of the fungus is found to be lungs and brain in addition to its sequestration in sinusoidal spaces. Presently with the ongoing COVID 19 pandemic, the prevalence of this infection is found to be high in the Indian population. The fungus establishes itself by affecting the compromised immune system of an individual and thereby making the individual susceptible to other diseases/infection. The reasons attributed to the sudden upsurge are steroidal therapeutics abuse, tocilizumab therapy and diabetes mellitus.To avert the cytokine storm, the medical health workers are necessitated to include steroid drugs in COVID 19 treatment protocol however inclusion of these drugs in patients who do essentially require steroids can have their immune system debilitated and permit the invasion of this fungus. According to International Diabetes Federation (IDF), 77 million Indians are known to be diabetic, cautioning the physicians to be vigilante of the impending black fungus infection in the event of COVID19 affliction in such individuals. There is causal relationship between anti-hyperglycemic drugs and weakened immune system and opportunity for the fungus invasion. This review attempts to explain the inter-relatedness of COVID19 infection, its treatment and eventual black fungus infection risk.","Bhogireddy, Ramadevi; Krishnamurthy, Venkataraman; Jabaris S, Sugin Lal; Pullaiah, Chitikela P; Manohar, Swetha",Braz J Infect Dis,96,0

STUDY DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: A telephone survey using random telephone numbers and a structured questionnaire was conducted in Hong Kong general population. Eight hundred and eighteen Hong Kong residents of age 18–60 years completed the interview (response rate: 65%) at around end of June 2003, the early ending phase of the epidemic. RESULTS: Over 60% of the respondents stated that they cared more about the family members' feelings; about 30%–40% stated that they found their friends, their family members more supportive or having more sharing with others when not feeling happy; only a few percent felt the opposite. Further, about 2/3 of the respondents paid more attention to their mental health. About 35%–40% took more time to rest, for relaxation or doing exercise. These items were, in general, negatively associated with post-traumatic stress, perception of stress and other perceptions that were related to SARS. CONCLUSIONS: SARS have brought some positive impacts on social/family support, mental health awareness and lifestyle changes.

In the first years of life, the vast majority of respiratory tract infections (RTI) leading to wheezing and asthma are of a viral origin and severity and recurrence are the consequence of a greater exposure to infectious agents in a period when the immune system is still relatively immature. Therefore, boosting the efficiency of the host immune response against viral infections seems to be a rational preventative approach. In the last decades it has been demonstrated that living in farm environments, i.e. early-life exposure to microbes, may reduce the risk of allergic and infectious disorders, increasing the immune response efficacy. These findings have suggested that treatment with bacterial lysates could promote a nonspecific immunomodulation useful in the prevention of recurrent RTIs and of wheezing inception and persistence. Experimental and clinical studies showing the reduction of RTI frequency and severity in childhood and elucidating the involved mechanisms can support this hypothesis.","Rossi, Giovanni A.; Pohunek, Petr; Feleszko, Wojciech; Ballarini, Stefania; Colin, Andrew A.",Clin Transl Allergy,96,24

Our aim is to explore the current risks or barriers to primary care research capacity building, identify the ongoing tensions that need to be resolved and offer some solutions, focusing on emerging contexts. This paper arose from a workshop held at the 2019 North American Primary Care Research Group Annual Meeting addressing research capacity building in LMICs. Five case studies (three from Africa, one from South-East Asia and one from South America) illustrate tensions and solutions to strengthening PHC research around the world. Research must be conducted in local contexts and be responsive to the needs of patients, populations and practitioners in the community. The case studies exemplify that research capacity can be strengthened at the micro (practice), meso (institutional) and macro (national policy and international collaboration) levels. Clinicians may lack coverage to enable research time; however, practice-based research is precisely the most relevant for PHC. Increasing research capacity requires local skills, training, investment in infrastructure, and support of local academics and PHC service providers to select, host and manage locally needed research, as well as to disseminate findings to impact local practice and policy. Reliance on funding from high-income countries may limit projects of higher priority in LMIC, and ‘brain drain’ may reduce available research support; however, we provide recommendations on how to deal with these tensions.","Ponka, David; Coffman, Megan; Fraser-Barclay, Krystle Elizabeth; Fortier, Richard D W; Howe, Amanda; Kidd, Michael; Lennon, Robert P; Madaki, Jeremiah K A; Mash, Bob; Mohd Sidik, Sherina; van Weel, Chris; Zawaly, Kristina; Goodyear-Smith, Felicity",BMJ Glob Health,96,28

Accordingly, the Korean government is sizing up and modernizing slaughterhouses to expedite the slaughter and to increase the safety of livestock products. The labor-intensive slaughter industry is undergoing major changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which will speed up the automation of slaughterhouses. Various automation devices are also being introduced in Korea, and currently the Korean government is introducing a pork meat yield grading machine to increase the accuracy of judgments based on the increasing slaughter volume. However, because such equipment is quite expensive, it is not easy to introduce, and a detailed study on the utility of the related equipment and an economic feasibility analysis has not been conducted. Therefore, in this study, we tried to prove the validity of the introduction of the equipment through the effectiveness study and economic analysis of the automatic meat yield grading machine, and a plan to increase the economic effect was considered. ABSTRACT: Currently, the pork industry is incorporating in-line automation with the aim of increasing the slaughtered pork carcass throughput while monitoring quality and safety. In Korea, 21 parameters (such as back-fat thickness and carcass weight) are used for quality grading of pork carcasses. Recently, the VCS2000 system—an automatic meat yield grading machine system—was introduced to enhance grading efficiency and therefore increase pork carcass production. The VCS2000 system is able to predict pork carcass yield based on image analysis. This study also conducted an economic analysis of the system using a cost—benefit analysis. The subsection items of the cost-benefit analysis considered were net present value (NPV), internal rate of return (IRR), and benefit/cost ratio (BC ratio), and each method was verified through sensitivity analysis. For our analysis, the benefits were grouped into three categories: the benefits of reducing labor costs, the benefits of improving meat yield production, and the benefits of reducing pig feed consumption through optimization. The cost-benefit analysis of the system resulted in an NPV of approximately 615.6 million Korean won, an IRR of 13.52%, and a B/C ratio of 1.65.","Kim, Juntae; Han, Hyo-Dong; Lee, Wang Yeol; Wakholi, Collins; Lee, Jayoung; Jeong, Youn-Bok; Bae, Jeong Hwan; Cho, Byoung-Kwan",Animals (Basel),96,22

S protein is heavily glycosylated and the glycosylation sites are relatively conserved, thus glycans on S protein surface could be a target for the development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 strategies against variants. Here, we collected 12 plant-derived lectins with different carbohydrate specificity and evaluated their anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity against mutant strains and epidemic variants using a pseudovirus-based neutralization assay. The Lens culinaris-derived lentil lectin which specifically bind to oligomannose-type glycans and GlcNAc at the non-reducing end terminus showed most potent and broad antiviral activity against a panel of mutant strains and variants, including the artificial mutants at N-/O-linked glycosylation site, natural existed amino acid mutants, as well as the epidemic variants B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1. Lentil lectin also showed antiviral activity against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. We found lentil lectin could block the binding of ACE2 to S trimer and inhibit SARS-CoV-2 at the early steps of infection. Using structural information and determined N-glycan profile of S trimer, taking together with the carbohydrate specificity of lentil lectin, we provide a basis for the observed broad spectrum anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. Lentil lectin showed weak haemagglutination activity at 1 mg/mL and no cytotoxicity activity, and no weight loss was found in single injection mouse experiment. This report provides the first evidence that lentil lectin strongly inhibit infection of SARS-COV-2 variants, which should provide valuable insights for developing future anti-SARS-CoV-2 strategies.","Wang, Wenbo; Li, Qianqian; Wu, Jiajing; Hu, Yu; Wu, Gang; Yu, Chuanfei; Xu, Kangwei; Liu, Xumei; Wang, Qihui; Huang, Weijin; Wang, Lan; Wang, Youchun",Emerging microbes & infections,96,5

Then we aimed to develop a decision tree model as a screening tool for unrecognized smartphone addiction by conducting large sample investigation in mainland China. Methods: The data from cross-sectional investigation of smartphone addiction among children and adolescents in mainland China (n = 3,615) was used to build models of smartphone addiction by employing logistic regression, visualized nomogram, and decision tree analysis. Results: Smartphone addiction was found in 849 (23.5%) of the 3,615 respondents. According to the results of logistic regression, nomogram, and decision tree analyses, Internet addiction, hours spend on smartphone during the epidemic, levels of clinical anxiety symptoms, fear of physical injury, and sex were used in predictive model of smartphone addiction among children and adolescents. The C-index of the final adjusted model of logistic regression was 0.804. The classification accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and AUC area of decision tree for detecting smartphone addiction were 87.3, 71.4, 92.1, 73.5, 91.4, and 0.884, respectively. Conclusions: It was found that the incidence of smartphone addiction among children and adolescents is significant during the epidemic. The decision tree model can be used to screen smartphone addiction among them.

Traditionally, ADMs have been developed to describe the atmospheric transport of chemical pollutants, radioactive matter, dust, and particulate matter. However, they have also enabled researchers to simulate bioaerosol dispersion. To inform risk assessment, the aims of this review were fourfold, namely (1) to describe the most important physical processes related to ADMs and pathogen transport, (2) to discuss studies that focused on the application of ADMs to pathogenic bioaerosols, (3) to discuss emission and inactivation rate parameterisations, and (4) to discuss methods for conversion of concentrations to infection probabilities (concerning quantitative microbial risk assessment). The studies included human, livestock, and industrial sources. Important factors for dispersion included wind speed, atmospheric stability, topographic effects, and deposition. Inactivation was mainly governed by humidity, temperature, and ultraviolet radiation. A majority of the reviewed studies, however, lacked quantitative analyses and application of full quantitative microbial risk assessments (QMRA). Qualitative conclusions based on geographical dispersion maps and threshold doses were encountered frequently. Thus, to improve risk assessment for future outbreaks and releases, we recommended determining well-quantified emission and inactivation rates and applying dosimetry and dose–response models to estimate infection probabilities in the population at risk.","Van Leuken, J.P.G.; Swart, A.N.; Havelaar, A.H.; Van Pul, A.; Van der Hoek, W.; Heederik, D.",Microb Risk Anal,96,1

We investigate whether the regular use of dietary supplements can reduce the risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection in around 1.4M users of the COVID Symptom Study App who completed a supplement use questionnaire. Design: Longitudinal app-based community survey and nested case control study. Setting: Subscribers to an app that was launched to enable self-reported information related to SARS-CoV-2 infection for use in the general population in three countries. Main Exposure: Self-reported regular dietary supplement usage since the beginning of the pandemic. Main Outcome Measures: SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by viral RNA polymerase chain reaction test (RT-PCR) or serology test. A secondary outcome was new-onset anosmia. Results: In an analysis including 327,720 UK participants, the use of probiotics, omega-3 fatty acids, multivitamins or vitamin D was associated with a lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection by 14%(95%CI: [8%,19%]), 12%(95%CI: [8%,16%]), 13%(95%CI: [10%,16%]) and 9%(95%CI: [6%,12%]), respectively, after adjusting for potential confounders. No effect was observed for vitamin C, zinc or garlic supplements. When analyses were stratified by sex, age and body mass index (BMI), the protective associations for probiotics, omega-3 fatty acids, multivitamins and vitamin D were observed in females across all ages and BMI groups, but were not seen in men. The same overall pattern of association was observed in both the US and Swedish cohorts. Results were further confirmed in a sub-analysis of 993,365 regular app users who were not tested for SARS-CoV-2 with cases (n= 126,556) defined as those with new onset anosmia (the strongest COVID-19 predictor). Conclusion: We observed a modest but significant association between use of probiotics, omega-3 fatty acid, multivitamin or vitamin D supplements and lower risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 in women. No clear benefits for men were observed nor any effect of vitamin C, garlic or zinc for men or women. Randomised controlled trials of selected supplements would be required to confirm these observational findings before any therapeutic recommendations can be made.","Louca, P.; Murray, B.; Klaser, K.; Graham, M.

We are also interested in whether increased accuracy can be achieved by adding sensors to capture the state of doors and windows of the given room and/or the whole home, and what type of machine learning algorithms can take advantage of the additional information. As experimentation on real-world homes is highly expensive, we use ScaledHome, a 1:12 scale, IoT-enabled model of a smart home for data acquisition.

The study presents a comparison of the principal determinants of individual food insecurity in Europe and other Continents, with particular regard to gender, since the literature clearly states the importance of women in the administration of food in the household. The study of gender related differences in food insecurity is particularly important in Europe, since women experience food insecurity at a larger extent than men, but with a variability related to the geographical distribution and with complex relationships with economic and social drivers. Using a large international sample of individual level data, that allows the analysis for developed Countries for the first time, and the first experiential measure of food insecurity comparable at the global level, the paper analyses the principal determinants of gender differences in food insecurity. In order to verify if women’s vulnerability in food insecurity is moderated by specific factors, the modelling approach allows gender to vary by education, poverty, place of residence. The results suggest that the driver that could most mitigate women disadvantage is education: people with a university degree present a lower probability of experiencing food insecurity, both for men and for women. On the contrary, familial characteristics, such as the number of children in the household, present a higher impact on women’s food insecurity than on men’s.","Grimaccia, Elena; Naccarato, Alessia",Soc Indic Res,96,16

As such, cell therapies are currently one of the most investigated therapeutic modalities in both preclinical and clinical settings, with many products having been approved and many more under active clinical investigation. Here, we highlight the diversity and key advantages of cell therapies and discuss their current clinical advances. In particular, we review 28 globally approved cell therapy products and their clinical use. We also analyze >1700 current active clinical trials of cell therapies, with an emphasis on discussing their therapeutic applications.

In an effort to assure accordance with these instructions, equitable strategies for at-risk and vulnerable populations and communities are warranted. One such strategy was our community conference calls, implemented to disseminate information on the pandemic and allow community leaders to discuss struggles and successes. Over the first 6 weeks, we held 12 calls, averaging 125 (standard deviation 41) participants. Participants were primarily from congregations and faith-based organizations that had an established relationship with the hospital, but also included school leaders, elected officials, and representatives of housing associations. Issues discussed included reasons for quarantining, mental health, social isolation, health disparities, and ethical concerns regarding hospital resources. Concerns identified by the community leaders as barriers to effective quarantining and adherence to precautions included food access, housing density, and access to screening and testing. Through the calls, ways to solve such challenges were addressed, with novel strategies and resources reaching the community.

We further investigated the mutational profile on a bi-monthly basis and traced the progress over the time. Several new mutations have emerged post-travel-ban and on the rise in specific countries, chief among them being A222V and S477N in Spike, and A220V in Nucleocapsid protein. Consequently, we examined the Spike protein epitopes to inspect whether any of these country-specific mutations overlapped with these epitopes. Several mutations were found to be contained within one or more epitopes, including the highly mutated residues of Spike protein, advocating the requirement of active monitoring of vaccine efficacies in respective countries.","Laha, S.; Chatterjee, R.",,96,1

Prior studies have not examined the association of medication dose with risks. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included people aged ≥18 years enrolled in a US integrated healthcare system for at least 4 months as of 2/29/2020. Current ACEI and ARB use was identified from pharmacy data, and the estimated daily dose was calculated and standardized across medications. COVID-19 infections and hospitalizations were identified through 6/14/2020 from laboratory and hospitalization data. We used logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals, adjusting for race/ethnicity, obesity and other covariates. RESULTS: Among 322,044 individuals, 826 developed COVID-19 infection. Among people using ACEI/ARBs, 204/56,105 developed COVID-19 (3.6 per 1000 individuals) compared with 622/265,939 without ACEI/ARB use (2.3 per 1000), yielding an adjusted OR of 0.91 (95% CI 0.74-1.12). For use of < 1 defined daily dose vs. nonuse, the adjusted OR for infection was 0.92 (95% CI 0.66-1.28); for 1 to < 2 defined daily doses, 0.89 (95% CI 0.66-1.19); and for ≥2 defined daily doses, 0.92 (95% CI 0.72-1.18). The OR was similar for ACEIs and ARBs and in subgroups by age and sex. 26% of people with COVID-19 infection were hospitalized; the adjusted OR for hospitalization in relation to ACEI/ARB use was 0.98 (95% CI 0.63-1.54), and there was no association with dose.

We present interim safety and immunogenicity results of the first-in-human study of the CoV2 preS dTM vaccine with two different adjuvant formulations. METHODS: This phase 1–2, randomised, double-blind study is being done in healthy, SARS-CoV-2-seronegative adults in ten clinical research centres in the USA. Participants were stratified by age (18–49 years and ≥50 years) and randomly assigned using an interactive response technology system with block randomisation (blocks of varying size) to receive one dose (on day 1) or two doses (on days 1 and 22) of placebo or candidate vaccine, containing low-dose (effective dose 1·3 μg) or high-dose (2·6 μg) antigen with adjuvant AF03 (Sanofi Pasteur) or AS03 (GlaxoSmithKline) or unadjuvanted high-dose antigen (18–49 years only). Primary endpoints were safety, assessed up to day 43, and immunogenicity, measured as SARS-C0V-2 neutralising antibodies (geometric mean titres), assessed on days 1, 22, and 36 serum samples. Safety was assessed according to treatment received in the safety analysis set, which included all randomly assigned participants who received at least one dose. Neutralising antibody titres were assessed in the per-protocol analysis set for immunogenicity, which included participants who received at least one dose, met all inclusion and exclusion criteria, had no protocol deviation, had negative results in the neutralisation test at baseline, and had at least one valid post-dose serology sample. This planned interim analysis reports data up to 43 days after the first vaccination; participants in the trial will be followed up for 12 months after the last study injection. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04537208, and is ongoing. FINDINGS: Between Sept 3 and Sept 29, 2020, 441 individuals (299 aged 18–49 years and 142 aged ≥50 years) were randomly assigned to one of the 11 treatment groups. The interim safety analyses included 439 (>99%) of 441 randomly assigned participants (299 aged 18–49 years and 140 aged ≥50 years). Neutralising antibody titres were analysed in 326 (74%) of 441 participants (235 [79%] of 299 aged 18–49 years and 91 [64%] of 142 aged ≥50 years). There were no vaccine-related unsolicited immediate adverse events, serious adverse events, medically attended adverse events classified as severe, or adverse events of special interest. Among all study participants, solicited local and systemic reactions of any grade after two vaccine doses were reported in 81% (95% CI 61–93; 21 of 26) of participants in the low-dose plus AF03 group, 93% (84–97; 74 of 80) in the low-dose plus AS03 group, 89% (70–98; 23 of 26) in the high-dose plus AF03 group, 95% (88–99; 81 of 85) in the high-dose plus AS03 group, 29% (10–56; five of 17) in the unadjuvanted high-dose group, and 21% (8–40; six of 29) in the placebo group. A single vaccine dose did not generate neutralising antibody titres above placebo levels in any group at days 22 or 36. Among participants aged 18–49 years, neutralising antibody titres after two vaccine doses were 13·1 (95% CI 6·40–26·9) in the low-dose plus AF03 group, 20·5 (13·1–32·1) in the low-dose plus AS03 group, 43·2 (20·6–90·4) in the high-dose plus AF03 group, 75·1 (50·5–112·0) in the high-dose plus AS03 group, 5·00 (not calculated) in the unadjuvanted high-dose group, and 5·00 (not calculated) in the placebo group. Among participants aged 50 years or older, neutralising antibody titres after two vaccine doses were 8·62 (1·90–39·0) in the low-dose plus AF03 group, 12·9 (7·09–23·4) in the low-dose plus AS03 group, 12·3 (4·35–35·0) in the high-dose plus AF03 group, 52·3 (25·3–108·0) in the high-dose plus AS03 group, and 5·00 (not calculated) in the placebo group. INTERPRETATION: The lower than expected immune responses, especially in the older age groups, and the high reactogenicity after dose two were probably due to higher than anticipated host-cell protein content and lower than planned antigen doses in the formulations tested, which was discovered during characterisation studies on the final bulk drug substance. Further development of the AS03-adjuvanted candidate vaccine will focus on identifying the optimal antigen formulation and dose.

Furthermore, those with uncontrolled diabetes are at a higher risk for complications due to COVID-19. The purpose of this study is to find an innovative method to sustain effective diabetes care services amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Outpatient diabetes care was successfully transformed from traditional face-to-face encounters in the clinic to an online telemedicine service. Results 1,972 patients were encountered over a 4-week study period during which we had a low proportion of unreached patients (4%). Some patients were still seen in person because they came as walk-in visits or insisted to be seen in person. Conclusion Telemedicine has become an essential healthcare service and could be augmented by the use of technology like web-based applications and communication via transfer of data from patients’ glucometer, insulin pumps, or sensors. Diabetes care can be transitioned to telemedicine effectively and would be successful in reaching more patients than by traditional face-to-face visits.

The many papers that have been written on this topic collectively stress the importance of this a priori analysis in the model development process. The story however, often ends with a structurally unidentifiable model. This may leave a model developer with no plan of action on how to address this potential issue. We continue this model exploration journey by identifying one of the possible sources of a model’s unidentifiability: problematic initial conditions. It is well-known that certain initial values may result in the loss of local structural identifiability. Nevertheless, literature on this topic has been limited to the analysis of small toy models. Here, we present a systematic approach to detect problematic initial conditions of real-world systems biology models, that are usually not small. A model’s identifiability can often be reinstated by changing the value of such problematic initial conditions. This provides modellers an option to resolve the “unidentifiable model” problem. Additionally, a good understanding of which initial values should rather be avoided can be very useful during experimental design. We show how our approach works in practice by applying it to five models. First, two small benchmark models are studied to get the reader acquainted with the method. The first one shows the effect of a zero-valued problematic initial condition. The second one illustrates that the approach also yields correct results in the presence of input signals and that problematic initial conditions need not be zero-values. For the remaining three examples, we set out to identify key initial values which may result in the structural unidentifiability. The third and fourth examples involve a systems biology Epo receptor model and a JAK/STAT model, respectively. In the final Pharmacokinetics model, of which its global structural identifiability has only recently been confirmed, we indicate that there are still sets of initial values for which this property does not hold.","Joubert, Dominique; Stigter, J.

Our data, including benchmarking using 597 clinical patient samples and a standardised diagnostic system, demonstrate that direct RT-PCR is viable option to extraction-based tests. Using controlled amounts of active SARS-CoV-2, we confirm effectiveness of heat inactivation by plaque assay and evaluate various generic buffers as transport medium for direct RT-PCR. Significant savings in time and cost are achieved through RNA-extraction-free protocols that are directly compatible with established PCR-based testing pipelines.

GMVs can increase access to integrative care while providing additional benefits including increased clinician-patient contact time, cost savings, and support with prevention and self-management of chronic conditions. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many clinical sites are experimenting with new models of care delivery including virtual GMVs using telehealth. Little research has focused on which clinicians offer this type of care, how the GMV approach affects the ways they practice, and their job satisfaction. Workplace-based interventions have been shown to decrease burnout in individual physicians. We argue that more research is needed to understand if GMVs should be considered among these workplace-based interventions, given their potential benefits to clinician wellbeing. GMVs can benefit clinician wellbeing in multiple ways, including: (1) Extended time with patients; (2) Increased ability to provide team-based care; (3) Understanding patients’ social context and addressing social determinants of health. GMVs can be implemented in a variety of settings in many different ways depending on institutional context, patient needs and clinician preferences. We suggest that GMV programs with adequate institutional support may be beneficial for preventing burnout and improving retention among clinicians and health care teams more broadly, including in integrative health care. Just as group support benefits patients struggling with loneliness and social isolation, GMVs can help address these and other concerns in overwhelmed clinicians.","Thompson-Lastad, Ariana; Gardiner, Paula",Glob Adv Health Med,96,1

However, little is known about the mechanisms of action of these antibodies or their effective dosing windows. We report the discovery and development of SC31, a potent SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing IgG1 antibody, originally isolated from a convalescent patient at day 27 after the onset of symptoms. Neutralization occurs via a binding epitope that maps within the ACE2 interface of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, conserved across all common circulating SARS-CoV-2 mutants. In SARS-CoV-2 infected K18-human ACE2 transgenic mice, SC31 demonstrated potent survival benefit by dramatically reducing viral load concomitant with attenuated pro-inflammatory responses linked to severe systemic disease, such as IL-6. Comparison with a Fc-null LALA variant of SC31 demonstrated that optimal therapeutic efficacy of SC31 requires intact Fc-mediated effector functions that can further induce an IFNγ-driven anti-viral immune response. Dose-dependent efficacy for SC31 was observed down to 5mg/kg when dosed before the activation of lung inflammatory responses. Importantly, despite FcγR binding, no evidence of antibody dependent enhancement was observed with the Fc-competent SC31 even at sub-therapeutic doses. Therapeutic efficacy was confirmed in SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters, where SC31 again significantly reduced viral load, decreased lung lesions and inhibited progression to severe disease manifestations. This study underlines the potential for significant COVID-19 patient benefit for the SC31 antibody that justifies rapid advancement to the clinic, as well as highlighting the importance of appropriate mechanistic and functional studies during development.

However, the role of the common cold virus (human rhinovirus) in the production of symptoms and lower airway inflammation at COPD exacerbation is unknown. Thirty three patients with moderate‐to‐severe COPD were seen at baseline, when the number of chest infections in the previous year was noted, and acutely at COPD exacerbation. Within 48 h after the onset of the exacerbation and at baseline, nasal aspirates and induced sputum were taken for rhinovirus reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) analysis and determination of cytokine levels. Symptoms, recorded on diary cards, were noted and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) measured. At exacerbation, mean FEV1 and FVC fell significantly from baseline (p<0.001). Ten of 43 exacerbations were associated with rhinovirus infection, detected in induced sputum. In four of these, nasophageal samples contained no detectable rhinovirus. All baseline samples were negative for rhinovirus. The simultaneous presence of increased nasal discharge/nasal congestion (in 26 of the 43 exacerbations) and increased sputum (29 exacerbations) was strongly associated with the presence of rhinovirus (odds ratio 6.15; p=0.036). Total symptom scores were greater for rhinovirus as compared to nonrhinovirus exacerbations (p=0.039). Median baseline sputum interleukin‐6 levels rose from 90.2 to 140.3 pg·mL(‐1) at exacerbation (p=0.005); the change was greater in the presence of rhinovirus infection (p=0.008).

The objective of the survey was to evaluate the amount and type of emergencies attended during this period, as well as to know how they were solved, and what measures were adopted to carry out dental care in these exceptional circumstances. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 312 Spanish dentists, who fulfilled an online questionnaire with 22 closed questions, divided into five sections regarding to various aspects of professional dental profile and emergency care. Descriptive statistic and Chi-square tests were performed (p<0.05). RESULTS: 75.64% of respondents attended emergencies in person only when required, being dental pain the main emergency (90.38%). Dental emergency care in person involved a prior telephone triage of the patient to identify possible COVID-19 symptoms, as well as protective measures implementation for both, the patient and the dentist, at dental office. CONCLUSIONS: The number of dental emergencies decreased during the state of alarm, being dental pain the main cause of dental assistance via telephone or in person. Triage of patients before scheduling an in-person appointment and protective measures implementation were common features in dental emergency care during the first state of alarm period.

Use is made of the vector autoregressive asymmetric dynamic conditional correlation generalised autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (VAR-ADCC-GARCH) model to this end. Moreover, the paper assesses the magnitude of the optimal portfolio weight, hedge ratio and hedge effectiveness for portfolios constituted of a pair of assets, namely oil-stock and gold-stock pairs. The findings of the study show that there is significant volatility spillover between the gold and stock markets, and the oil and stock markets. This finding suggests the importance of the link between the commodity and stock markets, which is essential for portfolio management. With reference to portfolio optimization and the possibility of hedging when using the pairs of assets under study, the findings suggest the importance of combining gold and stocks as the best strategy to hedge against stocks risk, especially during financial crises.","Morema, Kgotso; Bonga-Bonga, Lumengo",Resources Policy,96,1

The level of targeted protein expression and siRNA uptake were examined in A549 cells. CS-modified PLGA NS exhibited much higher encapsulation efficiency than unmodified PLGA NS (plain-PLGA NS). CS-modified PLGA NS showed a positive zeta potential, while plain-PLGA NS were negatively charged. siRNA uptake studies by observation with confocal leaser scanning microscopy (CLSM) indicated that siRNA-loaded CS-modified PLGA NS were more effectively taken up by the cells than plain-PLGA NS. The efficiencies of different siRNA preparations were compared at the level of targeted protein expression. The gene-silencing efficiency of CS-modified PLGA NS was higher and more prolonged than those of plain-PLGA NS and naked siRNA. This result correlated with the CLSM studies, which may have been due to higher cellular uptake of CS-modified PLGA NS due to electrostatic interactions. It was concluded that CS-modified PLGA NS containing siRNA could provide an effective siRNA delivery system.","Tahara, Kohei; Yamamoto, Hiromitsu; Hirashima, Naohide; Kawashima, Yoshiaki",Eur J Pharm Biopharm,96,16

However, most were not echoed by the patients’ clinical manifestations, largely due to the lack of protein expression information of ACE2 and co-factors. Here, we incorporated the protein information to analyse the expression of ACE2, together with TMPRSS2 and Furin, two proteases assisting SARS-CoV-2 infection, at single cell level in situ, which we called protein-proofed single-cell RNA (pscRNA) profiling. Systemic analysis across 36 tissues revealed a rank list of candidate cells potentially vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2. The top targets are lung AT2 cells and macrophages, then cardiomyocytes and adrenal gland stromal cells, followed by stromal cells in testis, ovary and thyroid. Whereas, the polarized kidney proximal tubule cells, liver cholangiocytes and intestinal enterocytes are less likely to be the primary SARS-CoV-2 targets as ACE2 localizes at the apical region of cells, where the viruses may not readily reach. Actually, the stomach may constitute a physical barrier against SARS-CoV-2 as the acidic environment in normal stomach (pH < 2.0) could completely inactivate SARS-CoV-2 pseudo-viruses. These findings are in concert with the clinical characteristics of prominent lung symptoms, frequent heart injury, and uncommon intestinal symptoms and acute kidney injury. Together, we provide a comprehensive view on the potential SARS-CoV-2 targets by pscRNA profiling, and propose that, in addition to acute respiratory distress syndrome, attentions should also be paid to the potential injuries in cardiovascular, endocrine and reproductive systems during the treatment of COVID-19 patients.","Zhou, Lulin; Niu, Zubiao; Jiang, Xiaoyi; Zhang, Zhengrong; Zheng, You; Wang, Zhongyi; Zhu, Yichao; Gao, Lihua; Huang, Hongyan; Wang, Xiaoning; Sun, Qiang",bioRxiv,96,16

The presence of vagueness in knowledge represented with description logic impairs automating reasoning and inference making. The importance of reducing this vagueness in the formalization of medical knowledge representation is rising, considering the vulnerability of this domain to the expression of vague concepts or terms. This vagueness may be addressed from the perspective of ontology modeling language application such as ontology web language (OWL). Although several attempts have been made to tackle this problem in other disease prognoses such as diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, a similar effort is missing for breast cancer. Minimizing vagueness in breast cancer ontology is necessary to enhance automated reasoning and handle knowledge representation problems. This study proposes a framework for reducing vagueness in breast cancer ontology. The approach obtained breast cancer crisp ontology and applied fuzzy ontology elements based on the Fuzzy OWL2 model to formulate breast cancer fuzzy ontology. This was achieved by extending the elements of OWL2 (a more expressive version of OWL) with annotation properties to fuzzify the breast cancer crisp ontology. Results obtained showed a significant reduction of vagueness in the domain, yielding 0.38 for vagueness spread and 1.0 for vagueness explicitness. In addition, ontology metrics such as completeness, consistency, correctness and accuracy were also evaluated, and we obtained impressive performance. The implication of this result is the reduction of vagueness in breast cancer ontology, which provides increased computational reasoning support to applications using the ontology.","Oyelade, Olaide N.; Ezugwu, Absalom E.; Adewuyi, Sunday A.",Neural Comput Appl,96,26

A cross-sectional self-administered online survey was distributed via emails and social media networks between 2nd and 18th May 2020 corresponding to the week of the lockdown in Nigeria to eye care practitioners (ECPs). Data for 823 respondents were analyzed. Knowledge and risk practice were categorized as binary outcome and univariate and multivariate linear regression were used to examine the associated factors. The mean score for COVID-19-related knowledge of public health guidelines was high and varied across the ECPs. Ophthalmic Nurses, Ophthalmologists and Optometrists showed higher COVID-19-related knowledge than other ECPs (p < 0.001), particularly those working in the private sector. More than 50% of ECPs stated they provided essential services during the COVID-19 lockdown via physical consultation, particularly the Ophthalmologists. Most respondents reported that the guidelines provided by their Association were useful but expressed their lack of confidence in attending to patients during and after the COVID-19 lockdown. Compared to other ECPs in Nigeria, more Ophthalmic Nurses received training in the use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). This survey is the first to assess knowledge, attitudes and practice in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria. ECPs in Nigeria displayed good knowledge about COVID-19 and provided eye care services during the COVID-19 lockdown in Nigeria, despite the majority not receiving any training on the use of PPEs with concerns over attending to patients. There is need for the government to strengthen health systems by improving and extending training on standard infection prevention and control measures to ECPs for effective control of the pandemic and in the future as essential health workers.","Ekpenyong, Bernadine; Obinwanne, Chukwuemeka J.; Ovenseri-Ogbomo, Godwin; Ahaiwe, Kelechukwu; Lewis, Okonokhua O.; Echendu, Damian C.; Osuagwu, Uchechukwu L.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,96,8

Since then more than four million confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been reported around the globe. The current gold standard for etiological diagnosis is reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) analysis of respiratory tract specimens, but the test has a high false-negative rate due to both nasopharyngeal swab sampling error and viral burden. Hence diagnostic imaging has emerged as a fundamental component of current management of COVID-19 patients. Currently, high-resolution computed tomography (CT) is the main imaging tool for primary diagnosis and evaluation of disease severity in patients. Lung ultrasound (LUS) imaging has become a safe bedside imaging alternative that does no expose the patient to radiation, and minimizes the risk of contamination. Although the number of studies to date are limited, LUS findings have demonstrated high diagnostic sensitivity and accuracy, comparable to those of chest CT scans. In this article we review the current state of art of LUS in evaluating pulmonary changes induced by COVID-19. The goal is to identify characteristic sonographic findings most suited for the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia infections.","Sultan, Laith R; Sehgal, Chandra M",Ultrasound Med Biol,96,16

Now, numbers have increased, and it has been reintroduced to many places in China, Japan, and Korea. In the breeding season, the crested ibis has high food needs (fish, freshwater invertebrate, etc.) to feed nestlings, and it prefers areas with rice paddies and waterbodies near to trees for nesting. We compared nest site preference from 1981 to 2019, and found that nest sites moved closer to houses of local farmers. In the 1980s, crested ibises only lived in remote mountain areas, where the farmers were too poor to afford pesticide and fertilizer, and consequently rice paddies contained substantial fish populations. In the meantime, the massive use of pesticides in more populated areas had caused the collapse of fish populations. A pesticide ban was enforced from 1981 on, when the crested ibis was rediscovered, and the freshwater biodiversity gradually recovered. The crested ibis returned to lower and more populated areas containing their ancestral habitats with large areas of wetlands. ABSTRACT: The number of breeding pairs of crested ibis (Nipponia nippon) in Hanzhong, China has recovered remarkably from 2 to 511 from 1981 to 2019. Although the crested ibis has been closely monitored, the habitat preference of the bird has not been well studied despite the extensive increase in abundance. We used nest site data from the past 39 years and 30 environmental variables to develop species distribution models for each year. We applied random forest to select important environmental variables, and used logistic regressions to quantify the changes in habitat preferences in 39 years, taking into account the effects of interaction and quadratic terms. We found that six variables had strong impacts on nest site selection. The interaction term of rice paddies and waterbodies, and the quadratic term of precipitation of the wettest quarter of the year were the most important correlates of nest presence. Human impact at nest sites changed from low to high as birds increased their use of ancestral habitats with abundant rice paddies. We concluded that during the population recovery, the crested ibises retained their dependence on wetlands, yet moved from remote areas to populated rural regions where food resources had recovered due to the ban of pesticide use.","Ma, Liming; Li, Xinhai; Zhai, Tianqing; Zhang, Yazu; Song, Kai; Holyoak, Marcel; Sun, Yuehua",Animals (Basel),96,16

Considering biosafety issues and lack of positive specimens in some special locations in China, the routine specimens from healthy individuals were used to perform methodologies evaluations, in which the indexes were the differences of quantification cycle values ({Delta}Cq) between human derived internal reference control (IRC) genes of a specimen and quality control (QC). Serial experiments were carried out to evaluate various factors that might affect aforementioned methodologies, such as types of virus transport mediums, methods of specimen pretreatment and template preparation, specimen vortex strength, specimen storage temperature and duration. The results showed that using {Delta}Cq values as indexes, among various factors that might affect analytical performance, it was better to store specimens in the normal saline transport mediums, inactivate pathogens using water or metal bath, release more virus particles from swabs by vortex mixing, extract nucleic acids with centrifuge methods, and perform amplification assays timely. Aforementioned opinions and optimum conditions were further confirmed by SRAS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and clinical positive specimens.

CASE SUMMARY: We present a case of a 69-year-old man with a clinical presentation of massive-like pulmonary embolism (PE) overlapping with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. The diagnosis was made based on hypotension, severe oxygen desaturation (33%), and right ventricular dysfunction (RVD). We used alteplase and low-molecular-weight heparin, obtaining immediate clinical improvement. Also, we identified an extremely elevated D-dimer (31.2 mcg/mL), and computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) revealed an unexpected low thrombus burden and a crazy-paving pattern. Considering this, we decided to discontinue the alteplase. Therefore, the mechanisms of pulmonary hypertension and RVD could be multifactorial. Despite the patient’s respiratory status worsening and ongoing mechanical ventilation, biomarkers kept lowering to normal ranges. It appears a favourable outcome was related to early PE diagnosis and a multimodal therapeutic approach. DISCUSSION: Physicians in the ER should be warned about extremely high D-dimer measurements and severe oxygen desaturation as possible markers of severe COVID-19 pneumonia in patients with high-clinical suspicion of PE. Although ESC guidelines recommend immediate reperfusion in cardiogenic shock secondary to PE, we suggest initial CTPA in patients with high-clinical suspicion of severe COVID-19.","Betancourt-del Campo, Hector; Jerjes-Sanchez, Carlos; Castillo-Perez, Mauricio; López-de la Garza, Hector; Paredes-Vázquez, José Gildardo; Flores-Sayavedra, Yoezer Z; Moreno-Abril Hoyos, Francisco; Ibarra-Flores, Marcos",Eur Heart J Case Rep,96,1

METHODS: A prospective cohort study through a telephone survey was performed in 156 patients (143 for primary and 13 for revision) included in the TKR and RKR surgical waiting list before March 2020. Contact of each patient with COVID-19, stress and anxiety, perceived pain, and function were obtained in the interviews, and also the preference of each patient to have re-scheduled surgery (early or late). Finally, we registered their response (acceptance or refusal) when surgery was effectively re-scheduled. RESULTS: 88 out of 156 patients waiting for knee replacement (76/143 of those waiting for TKR, 12/13 of those waiting for RKR) declared themselves ready for surgery in less than 1 month. When re-scheduled, 115 patients underwent surgery and 41 refused. Significantly different preferences were found for age (more prone to surgery if under 65), revision surgery (more readily available), pain (7.9 ± 1.7/10 in NRS in those undergoing surgery, 5.6 ± 2.3/10 in those refusing, p = 0.000), or COVID-19 diagnosis, but not other close contact with COVID-19, comorbidities, stress, or anxiety. A logistic regression model confirmed that revision surgery (OR 9.33), perceived severe pain (OR 5.21), and age under 65 years (OR 5.82) were significantly associated with patient preference. The probability of patients over 65 to prefer early surgery reached 60% only with pain at or above 9/10. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical timing preferences for knee replacement vary between patients older than 65 years (immediate surgery only when pain is intense) and younger patients (immediate surgery no matter the amount of pain). Even if COVID-19 severely stroke our population, the need for knee replacement stood in the young population and even in the aged population at risk for COVID when pain was important.

The objective of this study was to assess the anxiety level during the COVID-19 pandemic among pregnant women and compare it between COVID-infected and non-infected groups. We prospectively assessed the daily routine and anxiety level using a bespoke questionnaire and GAD-7 scale validated for pregnant women. With logistic regression, we established possible risk factors of generalized anxiety disorder spectrum and main causes of concern. The dataset included 439 responders of our survey. Of which, 21% had COVID-19 infection during pregnancy; 38% were screened for possible generalized anxiety disorder and the proportion was higher in women who suffered from COVID-19 (48% vs. 35%, p = 0.03). Pre-pregnancy anxiety or depression diagnosis and intentional social contact avoidance increased the risk of anxiety (aOR 3.4 and 3.2). Fetal wellbeing was the main concern for 66% of the responders. The COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions substantially altered daily lives of pregnant women, exaggerating the prevalence of anxiety compared with the pre-COVID-19 studies (38% vs. 15%). COVID-19 infection during pregnancy was associated with increased levels of generalized anxiety scores. Patient-tailored psychological support should be a mainstay of comprehensive antenatal medical care in order to avoid anxiety- and stress-related complications.","Nowacka, Urszula; Kozlowski, Szymon; Januszewski, Marcin; Sierdzinski, Janusz; Jakimiuk, Artur; Issat, Tadeusz",Int J Environ Res Public Health,96,24

The first(t) of these compounds, chlortetracycline, was introduced in 1947. Tetracyclines were found to be highly effective against various pathogens including rickettsiae, as well as both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, thus becoming the first class of broad spectrum antibiotics. Many other interesting properties, unrelated to their antibiotic activity, have been identified for tetracyclines which have led to widely divergent experimental and clinical uses. For example, tetracyclines are also an effective anti-malarial drug. Minocycline, which can readily cross cell membranes, is known to be a potent anti-apoptotic agent. Another tetracycline, doxycycline is known to exert anti-protease activities. Doxycycline can inhibit matrix metalloproteinases which contribute to tissue destruction activities in diseases such as periodontitis. A large body of literature has provided additional evidence for the “beneficial” actions of tetracyclines, including their ability to act as reactive oxygen species scavengers and anti-inflammatory agents. This review provides a summary of tetracycline’s multiple mechanisms of action as a means to understand their beneficial effects.","Griffin, Michael O.; Ceballos, Guillermo; Villarreal, Francisco",Pharmacological Research,96,26

This study described the spatio-temporal pattern and measured the spatial association of the early stages of the COVID-19 epidemic in mainland China from 16 January–06 February 2020. METHODS: This study explored the spatial epidemic dynamics of COVID-19 in mainland China. Moran’s I spatial statistic with various definitions of neighbours was used to conduct a test to determine whether a spatial association of the COVID-19 infections existed. RESULTS: The spatial spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in China was observed. The results showed that most of the models, except medical-care-based connection models, indicated a significant spatial association of COVID-19 infections from around 22 January 2020. CONCLUSIONS: Spatial analysis is of great help in understanding the spread of infectious diseases, and spatial association was the key to the spatial spread during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in mainland China.","Kang, Dayun; Choi, Hyunho; Kim, Jong-Hun; Choi, Jungsoon",Int J Infect Dis,96,8

The risks of HCW infections can be mitigated with adequate precautions within healthcare facilities, especially with the use of personal protective equipment (PPE). We highlight and contextualise the findings of a Cochrane review on the type of PPE that protects best, the best way to put PPE on (donning) or to remove PPE (doffing) and how to train HCWs to use PPE. The review found low-certainty of evidence that full body PPE offer more protection, but HCWs may be faced with difficulty during donning and doffing. Following standard guidelines may be helpful in reducing infection and increasing compliance among HCWs. Video training and simulations may be better methods for training on the correct use of PPE than traditional methods of teaching. Countries must, therefore, ensure that HCWs undergo compulsory training on the correct use of PPE; regardless of their professional category. Of the 24 studies included in this review, none was conducted on the African continent. There is thus an urgent need for well conducted studies on the experiences of HCWs using full-body covering PPE within the African context. Such studies could lead to tailored interventions that will improve the proper use of PPE among HCWs.","Iwu, Chinwe Juliana; Jordan, Portia; Jaca, Anelisa; Iwu, Chidozie Declan; Schutte, Lorraine; Wiysonge, Charles Shey",Pan Afr Med J,96,1

Antibiotic, corticosteroid, and diuretic supportive treatment provided temporary improvement. After the initial positive response to treatment, the ferret's condition progressively deteriorated until the owners decided to euthanize the patient 15 days after initial presentation. Gross necropsy results revealed 5 mL of serosanguinous fluid within the thoracic cavity, cardiomegaly, and consolidated lungs that had a patchy, pale golden tissue pattern.

Several reports highlighted the risk of infection and disease in pregnant women and neonates. To assess the risk of clinical complications in pregnant women and neonates infected with SARS-CoV-2 carrying out a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies. DATA SOURCES: Search of the scientific evidence was performed using the engines PubMed and Scopus, including articles published from December 2019 to 15 April 2020. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Only observational studies focused on the assessment of clinical outcomes associated with pregnancy in COVID-19 women were selected. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: The first screening was based on the assessment of titles and abstracts, followed by the evaluation of full-texts. Qualitative variables were summarized with frequencies, whereas quantitative variables with central and variability indicators depending on their parametric distribution. Forest plots were used to describe point estimates and in-between studies variability. Study quality assessment was performed. RESULTS: Thirteen studies were selected. All of them were carried out in China. The mean (SD) age and gestational age of pregnant women were 30.3 (1.5) years and 35.9 (2.9) weeks, respectively. The mean (SD) duration from the first symptoms to the hospital admission and to labour were 5.5 (2.0) and 9.5 (8.7) days, respectively. Patients mainly complained of fever and cough (pooled (95% CI) proportions were 76.0% (57.0%-90.0%) and 38.0 (28.0%-47.0%), respectively). Several antibiotics, antivirals, and corticosteroids were prescribed in different combinations. The pooled prevalence of maternal complications and of caesarean section were 45.0% (95% CI: 24.0%-67.0%) and 88.0% (95%CI: 82.0%-94.0%). A proportion of pregnant women less than 20% were admitted to ICU. The pooled proportion of preterm infants was 23.0% (95%CI: 11.0%-39.0%). The most frequent neonatal complications were pneumonia and respiratory distress syndrome. The pooled percentage of infected neonates was 6.0% (95%CI: 2.0%-12.0%). CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests a high rate of maternal and neonatal complications in infected individuals. However, the current scientific evidence highlights a low risk of neonatal infection. Multicentre, cohort studies are needed to better elucidate the role of SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy.","Giampiero, Capobianco; Laura, Saderi; Stefano, Aliberti; Michele, Mondoni; Andrea, Piana; Francesco, Dessole; Margherita, Dessole; Luigi, Cherchi Pier; Salvatore, Dessole; Giovanni, Sotgiu",Eur J Obstet Gynecol Reprod Biol,96,24

Objective: To estimate the mean change in state-level COVID-19 epidemic growth before versus after the implementation of statewide social distancing measures. Design: Interrupted time-series analysis. Setting: United States. Measurements: Our primary exposure was time in relation to implementation of the first statewide social distancing measure. The pre-implementation period began 14 days prior to implementation and included up to 3 days after implementation to account for incubation. Post-implementation began 4 days after, up to and including March 30. Our primary outcome was the COVID-19 growth rate, calculated as the log of daily COVID-19 cases minus the log of daily COVID-19 cases on the prior day. Results: All states applied some form of statewide social distancing between March 10-27. The mean daily COVID-19 growth rate decreased beginning four days after implementation of the first statewide social distancing measures, by an additional 0.8% per day; 95% CI, -1.4% to -0.2%; P=0.002). This reduction corresponds to an increase in doubling time of the epidemic from 3.3 days (before) to 5.0 days (at 14 days after implementation). Limitations: Potential bias due to the aggregate nature of the ecological data, potential confounding by contemporaneous changes (e.g., increases in testing), and potential underestimation of social distancing due to spillovers across neighboring states. Conclusion: Statewide social distancing measures were associated with a decrease in U.S. COVID-19 epidemic growth. Based on the size of the epidemic at the time of implementation in each state, social distancing measures were associated with a decrease of 3,090 cases at 7 days, and 68,255 cases at 14 days, after implementation.","Siedner, Mark J; Harling, Guy; Reynolds, Zahra; Gilbert, Rebecca F; Venkataramani, Atheendar; Tsai, Alexander C",,96,21

Over 123,000,000 individuals have been infected with the coronavirus since a worldwide pandemic was declared in March 2020. We conducted this research to confirm the potential of herbal medicine as a treatment for coronavirus. METHODS: We infected the A549 cell line with betacoronavirus OC43 and then treated it with 100 μg/mL Hyunggaeyungyo-tang (HGYGT) or distilled water with a control of HGYGT. We measured the mRNA expression levels of proinflammatory cytokines and interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) to confirm the effectiveness of HGYGT upon coronavirus infection. RESULTS: We found that the effects of HYGYT decrease the expression level of pPKR, peIF2α, IFI6, IFI44, IFI44L, IFI27, IRF7, OASL, and ISG15 when administered to cells with coronavirus infection. The expressions of IL-1, TNF-α, COX-2, NF-κB, iNOS, and IKK mRNA were also significantly decreased in the HGYGT group than in the control group. CONCLUSION: Through the reduction of the amount of coronavirus RNA, our research indicates that HGYGT has antiviral effects. The reduction of IKK and iNOS mRNA levels indicate that HGYGT reduces coronavirus RNA expression and may inhibit the replication of coronavirus by acting on NF-kB/Rel pathways to protect oxidative injury. In addition, decreases in mRNA expression levels of proinflammatory cytokines indicate that the HGYGT may relieve the symptoms of coronavirus infections.","Won, Seo-Young; Seol, In-Chan; Yoo, Ho-Ryong; Kim, Yoon-Sik",Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,96,28

However, the impact on mortality is still controversial. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate whether there is a specific subgroup of patients in whom an active antiviral therapy also reduces the mortality. METHODS: Patients admitted for >48 h in our hospital for a SARS-CoV-2 confirmed or suspected infection from February 2020 to February 2021 were retrospectively analysed. The primary outcome of the study was mortality at 30 days. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify predictors of mortality. RESULTS: In total, 2607 patients (438 receiving remdesivir and 2169 not) were included with a median (IQR) age of 65 (54–77) years and 58% were male. Four hundred and seventy-six were admitted to the ICU (18.3%) and 264 required invasive mechanical ventilation (10.1%). The global 30 day mortality rate was 10.7%. Pre-admission symptom duration of 4–6 days and ≤3 days was associated with a 1.5- and 2.5-fold increase in the mortality rate, respectively, in comparison with >6 days and treatment with remdesivir was independently associated with a lower mortality rate (OR = 0.382, 95% CI = 0.218–0.671). The analysis showed that the major difference was among patients with shorter pre-admission symptom duration (<6 days). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with ≤3 days and 4–6 days from symptom onset to admission are associated with a 2.5- and 1.5-fold higher risk of death, respectively.

Arteriviruses (order Nidovirales) belong to the subset of +RNA viruses that induce double-membrane vesicles (DMVs), similar to the structures induced by e.g. coronaviruses, picornaviruses and hepatitis C virus. In the last years, electron tomography has revealed substantial differences between the structures induced by these different virus groups. Arterivirus-induced DMVs appear to be closed compartments that are continuous with endoplasmic reticulum membranes, thus forming an extensive reticulovesicular network (RVN) of intriguing complexity. This RVN is remarkably similar to that described for the distantly related coronaviruses (also order Nidovirales) and sets them apart from other DMV-inducing viruses analysed to date. We review here the current knowledge and open questions on arterivirus replication organelles and discuss them in the light of the latest studies on other DMV-inducing viruses, particularly coronaviruses. Using the equine arteritis virus (EAV) model system and electron tomography, we present new data regarding the biogenesis of arterivirus-induced DMVs and uncover numerous putative intermediates in DMV formation. We generated cell lines that can be induced to express specific EAV replicase proteins and showed that DMVs induced by the transmembrane proteins nsp2 and nsp3 form an RVN and are comparable in topology and architecture to those formed during viral infection. Co-expression of the third EAV transmembrane protein (nsp5), expressed as part of a self-cleaving polypeptide that mimics viral polyprotein processing in infected cells, led to the formation of DMVs whose size was more homogenous and closer to what is observed upon EAV infection, suggesting a regulatory role for nsp5 in modulating membrane curvature and DMV formation.","van der Hoeven, Barbara; Oudshoorn, Diede; Koster, Abraham J.; Snijder, Eric J.; Kikkert, Marjolein; Bárcena, Montserrat",Virus Res,96,1

However, there is a lack of data targeting the role of ACEs for one of the most prevalent mental health problems in health-care professionals: burnout. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the relationship between ACEs and the core burnout dimension ‘emotional exhaustion’ (EE). As health-care professionals have been facing particular challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic, we furthermore aimed to assess the role of COVID-19 associated burden in the interplay between ACEs and EE. METHODS: During the first lockdown in Germany, a total of 2500 medical healthcare professionals were questioned in a cross-sectional online survey. Questions targeted, among others, sociodemographics, ACEs, COVID-19-associated problems (e.g. increase of workload, worries about relatives and patients) and emotional exhaustion, measured by the respective dimension of the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI). RESULTS: In German health-care professionals, ACEs were associated with a higher EE score. The number of experienced ACEs was associated with the majority of assessed COVID-19-associated problems. An increasing number of ACEs predicted higher EE scores, controlling for gender. The association between ACEs and EE was mediated significantly by COVID-19-associated problems. These included maladaptive coping strategies such as increased smoking, drinking and use of antidepressants/tranquilizers, feeling less protected by measures of the employee or the state, a greater feeling of being burdened by COVID-19-associated problems and greater exhaustion and sleep problems. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest ACEs as significant risk factor for EE in German health-care professionals. The current pandemic means a significant burden that further pronounces this risk.","Clemens, Vera; Beschoner, Petra; Jarczok, Marc N.; Weimer, Katja; Kempf, Maximilian; Morawa, Eva; Geiser, Franziska; Albus, Christian; Steudte-Schmiedgen, Susan; Gündel, Harald; Fegert, J.M.; Jerg-Bretzke, Lucia",European journal of psychotraumatology,96,23

COVID-19 also presents with multiple ancillary systemic diseases and often involves cardiovascular, inflammatory, and/or neurological complications. Pathological viral genomes consisting of ssvRNA, like cellular messenger RNA (mRNA), are susceptible to attack, destruction, neutralization, and/or modulation by naturally occurring small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) within the host cell, some of which are known as microRNAs (miRNAs). This paper proposes that the actions of the 2650 known human miRNAs and other sncRNAs form the basis for an under-recognized and unappreciated innate-immune regulator of ssvRNA viral genome activities and have implications for the efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 invasion, infection, and replication. Recent research indicates that both miRNA and mRNA abundance, speciation, and complexity varies widely amongst human individuals, and this may: (i) In part explain the variability in the innate-immune immunological and pathophysiological response of different human individuals to the initiation and progression of SARS-CoV-2 infection in multiple tissue types; and (ii) further support our understanding of human biochemical and genetic individuality and the variable resistance of individuals to ssvRNA-mediated viral infection and disease. This commentary will briefly address current findings and concepts in this fascinating research area of non-coding RNA and innate-immunity with special reference to natural host miRNAs, SARS-CoV-2, and the current COVID-19 pandemic.","Lukiw, Walter J.",Noncoding RNA,96,1

Although this may have the beneficial effect of preventing infection, psychological distress may also increase with prolongation of the pandemic. METHODS: Geriatric patients were interviewed by telephone due to the ongoing curfew. Demographical characteristics, comorbidities, personal risk perception of COVID‐19, common concerns related to COVID‐19, and experiences of delayed hospital admission due to the pandemic were recorded. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was used to assess psychological distress, anxiety, and depression. RESULTS: Participants (n = 136; 82 females, 60.3%) had a mean age of 73.4 ± 5.9 years. The most common comorbidity was hypertension (75%). Approximately 80% of the participants reported a decrease in physical activity during the curfew period. The HADS scores indicated rates of anxiety as 25.7% and depression as 16.9%. Anxiety was significantly more common in females than males (P = 0.002). Sleep problems (P = 0.000), fatigue (P = 0.000), and hopelessness (P = 0.000) were more common in participants with depression and anxiety. Logistic regression analyses showed an association between a delay in hospital admission and the presence of depression (P = 0.0029, R(2) = 0.146). Personal risk perception of COVID‐19 was statistically significantly higher among patients with anxiety (P = 0.0027, R(2) = 0.157).

Severe forms of COVID-19 appear to be more frequent in obese patients, but an association with metabolic disorders is not established. Here, we focused on lipoprotein metabolism in patients hospitalized for severe pneumonia, depending on COVID-19 status. Thirty-four non-COVID-19 and 27 COVID-19 patients with severe pneumonia were enrolled. Most of them required intensive care. Plasma lipid levels, lipoprotein metabolism, and clinical and biological (including plasma cytokines) features were assessed. Despite similar initial metabolic comorbidities and respiratory severity, COVID-19 patients displayed a lower acute phase response but higher plasmatic concentrations of non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs). NEFA profiling was characterised by higher level of polyunsaturated NEFAs (mainly linoleic and arachidonic acids) in COVID-19 patients. Multivariable analysis showed that among severe pneumonia, COVID-19-associated pneumonia was associated with higher NEFAs, lower apolipoprotein E and lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations, independently of body mass index, sequential organ failure (SOFA) score, and C-reactive protein levels. NEFAs and PUFAs concentrations were negatively correlated with the number of ventilator-free days. Among hospitalized patients with severe pneumonia, COVID-19 is independently associated with higher NEFAs (mainly linoleic and arachidonic acids) and lower apolipoprotein E and HDL concentrations. These features might act as mediators in COVID-19 pathogenesis and emerge as new therapeutic targets. Further investigations are required to define the role of NEFAs in the pathogenesis and the dysregulated immune response associated with COVID-19.

Subjects serologically and/or molecularly (by nasal/throat swab) positives at basal for SARS-CoV-2 were excluded. Primary endpoint was to compare titers of neutralizing anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and seroprotection rates among the cohorts at 3 and 5 weeks from first dose. METHODS: Titration was done using LIAISON® SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG test, a quantitative chemiluminescent immunoassay approved by FDA on the basis of robust evidences of concordance (94.4%) between the test at cutoff of 15 AU/mL and the Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test 90% at 1:40 ratio. Cutoff of 15 AU/mL was assumed to discriminate responders to vaccination with a protective titer. Cohorts were compared using Fisher’ exact test and the Mann–Whitney test as appropriated. Geometric mean concentrations (GMCs), geometric mean ratios and response rates after 1st and 2nd dose were compared in each cohort by Wilcoxon and McNemar tests, respectively. RESULTS: At 5 weeks, GMC of IgG in elderly controls was 353.3 AU/mL versus 106.7 in MM (p = 0.003) and 172.9 in MPM patients (p = 0.049). Seroprotection rate at cutoff of 15 AU/mL was 100% in controls compared to 78.6% in MM (p = 0.003) and 88% in MPM patients (p = 0.038). In terms of logarithm of IgG titer, in a generalized multivariate linear model, no gender effect was observed (p = 0.913), while there was a significant trend toward lower titers by increasing age (p < 0.001) and in disease cohorts with respect to controls (MM: p < 0.001 and MPM: p < 0.001).

CONCLUSIONS: BNT162b2 has demonstrated to be immunogenic at different extent among the cohorts. Response was 88% and robust in MPM patients. MM patients responded significantly less, particularly those on anti-CD38-based treatment.

In addition to decreasing spread of SARS-CoV2, these measures also impact the transmission of seasonal viral pathogens, which are common triggers of COPD exacerbations. Whether reduced viral prevalence mediates reduction in COPD exacerbation rates is unknown. Methods: We performed retrospective analysis of data from a large, multicenter healthcare system to assess admission trends associated with community viral prevalence and with initiation of COVID-19 pandemic control measures. We applied difference-in-differences (DiD) analysis to compare season-matched weekly frequency of hospital admissions for COPD before and after implementation of public health measures for COVID-19. Community viral prevalence was estimated using regional Center for Disease Control and Prevention test positivity data and correlated to COPD admissions. Results: Data involving 4,422 COPD admissions demonstrated a season-matched 53% decline in COPD admissions during COVID-19 pandemic, which correlated to community viral burden (r=0.73; 95% CI: 0.67 to 0.78) and represented a 36% greater decline over admission frequencies observed in other medical conditions less affected by respiratory viral infections (IRR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.57 to 0.71, p<0.001). The post-COVID-19 decline in COPD admissions was most pronounced in patients with fewer comorbidities and without recurrent admissions. Conclusion: The implementation of public health measures during the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with decreased COPD admissions. These changes are plausibly explained by reduced prevalence of seasonal respiratory viruses.","So, Jennifer Y; O'Hara, Nathan N; Kenaa, Blaine; Williams, John G; deBorja, Christopher L; Slejko, Julia F; Zafari, Zafar; Sokolow, Michael; Zimand, Paul; Deming, Meagan; Marx, Jason; Pollak, Andrew N; Reed, Robert M",Am J Med,96,29

The major clinical feature of severe COVID-19 patients requiring ventilation is acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) possibly associated with a cytokine storm. OBJECTIVES: To elucidate serum levels of TNF-α and soluble TNF-Receptor 1 (sTNFR1) in patients with severe and mild COVID-19 disease as determinants of disease severity. METHODS: We determined serum TNF-α and sTNFR1 concentrations in 46 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 (17 patients with severe disease within the intensive care unit [ICU] and 29 non-severe, non-ICU patients) and 15 healthy controls upon admission using ELISA. Subjects were recruited between March-May 2020 at the Masih Daneshvari Hospital Tehran, Iran. RESULTS: Serum levels of sTNFRI were significantly higher in ICU patients (P<0.0001) and non-ICU patients (P=0.0342) compared with healthy subjects. Serum sTNFR1 were significantly higher in ICU patients than in non-ICU patients (P<0.0001). Serum TNF-α levels were greater in ICU and non-ICU patients than in the healthy subjects group (p<0.0001). The sTNFRI concentration in ICU (r=0.79, p=0.0002) and non-ICU (r=0.42, p=0.02) patients positively correlated with age although serum sTNFRI levels in ICU patients were significantly higher than in older healthy subjects. The sTNFRI concentration in ICU patients negatively correlated with ESR. CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrates higher sTNFRI in ICU patients with severe COVID-19 disease and this be a biomarker of disease severity and mortality. Future studies should examine whether lower levels of systemic sTNFR1 at admission may indicate a better disease outcome.","Mortaz, Esmaeil; Tabarsi, Payam; Jamaati, Hamidreza; Dalil Roofchayee, Neda; Dezfuli, Neda K.; Hashemian, Seyed MohammadReza; Moniri, Afshin; Marjani, Majid; Malekmohammad, Majid; Mansouri, Davood; Varahram, Mohammad; Folkerts, Gert; Adcock, Ian M.",Front Immunol,96,4

The goal of the field is to develop OVs that are easily manufactured, efficiently delivered to disseminated sites of cancer growth, undergo rapid intratumoral spread, selectively kill tumor cells, cause no collateral damage and pose no risk of transmission in the population. Here we discuss the many virus engineering strategies that are being pursued to optimize delivery, intratumoral spread and safety of OVs derived from different virus families. With continued progress, OVs have the potential to transform the paradigm of cancer care.","Maroun, Justin; Muñoz-Alía, Miguel; Ammayappan, Arun; Schulze, Autumn; Peng, Kah-Whye; Russell, Stephen",Future Virol,96,26

Despite the availability of methods for the discovery of antiviral drugs, the majority tend to focus on the effects of such drugs on a given virus, its constituent proteins, or enzymatic activity, often neglecting the consequences on host cells. This may lead to partial assessment of the efficacy of the tested anti-viral compounds, as potential toxicity impacting the overall physiology of host cells may mask the effects of both viral infection and drug candidates. Here we present a method able to assess the general health of host cells based on morphological profiling, for untargeted phenotypic drug screening against viral infections. RESULTS: We combine Cell Painting with antibody-based detection of viral infection in a single assay. We designed an image analysis pipeline for segmentation and classification of virus-infected and non-infected cells, followed by extraction of morphological properties. We show that this methodology can successfully capture virus-induced phenotypic signatures of MRC-5 human lung fibroblasts infected with human coronavirus 229E (CoV-229E). Moreover, we demonstrate that our method can be used in phenotypic drug screening using a panel of nine host- and virus-targeting antivirals. Treatment with effective antiviral compounds reversed the morphological profile of the host cells towards a non-infected state. CONCLUSIONS: The phenomics approach presented here, which makes use of a modified Cell Painting protocol by incorporating an anti-virus antibody stain, can be used for the unbiased morphological profiling of virus infection on host cells. The method can identify antiviral reference compounds, as well as novel antivirals, demonstrating its suitability to be implemented as a strategy for antiviral drug repurposing and drug discovery.

SUBJECT AND METHODS: In November 2009, we conducted an Internet-based cross-sectional survey of college students aged 18–24 years in a Midwestern State in the USA. We collected information on swine flu knowledge, perception on immunization safety, perceived efficacy of recommended behavior, changed behavior, and anxiety. RESULTS: Of the 236 respondents, 83.1% had some anxiety about swine flu, 64.8% believed avoiding crowded places was preventive, 33.5% believed the 2009 swine flu vaccine was safe, and 36.9% showed interest in receiving the vaccine. Misconceptions about swine flu contagion via eating cooked pork, water sources, and insect bites were common. Respondents were unaware of transmissions via contaminated objects and droplets. Only 42.6% were satisfied with governmental efforts. Women were more likely to wash hands frequently than men (odds ratio 2.80, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: There is a gap in swine flu knowledge, minimal risk reduction, increased amount of anxiety, and skepticism about swine flu vaccine safety. These gaps warrant serious attention to inform the public about specific actions regarding swine flu.","Kanadiya, Mehulkumar K.; Sallar, Anthony M.",Z Gesundh Wiss,96,16

The objective of the present study was to determine the causes and epidemiology of morbidity and mortality in dairy, beef and crossbred white veal production. A total of 5853 calves, housed in 15 production cohorts, were followed during one production cycle. Causes of mortality were determined by necropsy. Morbidity was daily recorded by the producers. RESULTS: The total mortality risk was 5,3% and was significantly higher in beef veal production compared to dairy or crossbreds. The main causes of mortality were pneumonia (1.3% of the calves at risk), ruminal disorders (0.7%), idiopathic peritonitis (0.5%), enterotoxaemia (0.5%) and enteritis (0.4%). Belgian Blue beef calves were more likely to die from pneumonia, enterotoxaemia and arthritis. Detection of bovine viral diarrhea virus at necropsy was associated with chronic pneumonia and pleuritis. Of the calves, 25.4% was treated individually and the morbidity rate was 1.66 cases per 1000 calf days at risk. The incidence rate of respiratory disease, diarrhea, arthritis and otitis was 0.95, 0.30, 0.11 and 0.07 cases per 1000 calf days at risk respectively. Morbidity peaked in the first three weeks after arrival and gradually declined towards the end of the production cycle. CONCLUSIONS: The present study provided insights into the causes and epidemiology of morbidity and mortality in white veal calves in Belgium, housed in the most frequent housing system in Europe. The necropsy findings, identified risk periods and differences between production systems can guide both veterinarians and producers towards the most profitable and ethical preventive and therapeutic protocols.","Pardon, Bart; De Bleecker, Koen; Hostens, Miel; Callens, Jozefien; Dewulf, Jeroen; Deprez, Piet",BMC Vet Res,96,20
