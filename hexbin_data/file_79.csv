124,124,124,Antidiabetes and Anti-obesity Activity of Lagerstroemia speciosa,13.630206,9.868837,2007-03-14,"The leaves of Lagerstroemia speciosa (Lythraceae), a Southeast Asian tree more commonly known as banaba, have been traditionally consumed in various forms by Philippinos for treatment of diabetes and kidney related diseases. In the 1990s, the popularity of this herbal medicine began to attract the attention of scientists worldwide. Since then, researchers have conducted numerous in vitro and in vivo studies that consistently confirmed the antidiabetic activity of banaba. Scientists have identified different components of banaba to be responsible for its activity. Using tumor cells as a cell model, corosolic acid was isolated from the methanol extract of banaba and shown to be an active compound. More recently, a different cell model and the focus on the water soluble fraction of the extract led to the discovery of other compounds. The ellagitannin Lagerstroemin was identified as an effective component of the banaba extract responsible for the activity. In a different approach, using 3T3-L1 adipocytes as a cell model and a glucose uptake assay as the functional screening method, Chen et al. showed that the banaba water extract exhibited an insulin-like glucose transport inducing activity. Coupling HPLC fractionation with a glucose uptake assay, gallotannins were identified in the banaba extract as components responsible for the activity, not corosolic acid. Penta-O-galloyl-glucopyranose (PGG) was identified as the most potent gallotannin. A comparison of published data with results obtained for PGG indicates that PGG has a significantly higher glucose transport stimulatory activity than Lagerstroemin. Chen et al. have also shown that PGG exhibits anti-adipogenic properties in addition to stimulating the glucose uptake in adipocytes. The combination of glucose uptake and anti-adipogenesis activity is not found in the current insulin mimetic drugs and may indicate a great therapeutic potential of PGG.","Klein, Guy; Kim, Jaekyung; Himmeldirk, Klaus; Cao, Yanyan; Chen, Xiaozhuo",Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,79,22

The EISS dataset was used to characterise important epidemiological features of influenza activity in Europe during eight winters (1999–2007). The following questions were addressed: 1) are the sentinel clinical reports a good measure of influenza activity? 2) how long is a typical influenza season in Europe? 3) is there a west-east and/or south-north course of peak activity ('spread') of influenza in Europe? METHODS: Influenza activity was measured by collecting data from sentinel general practitioners (GPs) and reports by national reference laboratories. The sentinel reports were first evaluated by comparing them to the laboratory reports and were then used to assess the timing and spread of influenza activity across Europe during eight seasons. RESULTS: We found a good match between the clinical sentinel data and laboratory reports of influenza collected by sentinel physicians (overall match of 72% for +/- 1 week difference). We also found a moderate to good match between the clinical sentinel data and laboratory reports of influenza from non-sentinel sources (overall match of 60% for +/- 1 week). There were no statistically significant differences between countries using ILI (influenza-like illness) or ARI (acute respiratory disease) as case definition. When looking at the peak-weeks of clinical activity, the average length of an influenza season in Europe was 15.6 weeks (median 15 weeks; range 12–19 weeks). Plotting the peak weeks of clinical influenza activity reported by sentinel GPs against the longitude or latitude of each country indicated that there was a west-east spread of peak activity (spread) of influenza across Europe in four winters (2001–2002, 2002–2003, 2003–2004 and 2004–2005) and a south-north spread in three winters (2001–2002, 2004–2005 and 2006–2007). CONCLUSION: We found that: 1) the clinical data reported by sentinel physicians is a valid indicator of influenza activity; 2) the length of influenza activity across the whole of Europe was surprisingly long, ranging from 12–19 weeks; 3) in 4 out of the 8 seasons, there was a west-east spread of influenza, in 3 seasons a south-north spread; not associated with type of dominant virus in those seasons.","Paget, John; Marquet, Richard; Meijer, Adam; van der Velden, Koos",BMC Infect Dis,79,3
827,827,827,Recent Advances in the Diagnosis and Treatment of Influenza Pneumonia,13.692128,10.1515,2012-04-03,"A potentially fatal complication of influenza infection is the development of pneumonia, caused either directly by the influenza virus, or by secondary bacterial infection. Pneumonia related to the 2009 influenza A pandemic was found to be underestimated by commonly used pneumonia severity scores in many cases, and to be rapidly progressive, leading to respiratory failure. Confirmation of etiology by laboratory testing is warranted in such cases. Rapid antigen and immunofluorescence testing are useful screening tests, but have limited sensitivity. Confirmation of pandemic H1N1 influenza A infection can only be made by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) or viral culture. The most effective preventive measure is annual influenza vaccination in selected individuals. Decisions to administer antiviral medications for influenza treatment or chemoprophylaxis should be based upon clinical and epidemiological factors, and should not be delayed by confirmatory laboratory testing results. Neuraminidase inhibitors (NI) are the agents of choice.","Marzoratti, Lucia; Iannella, Hernán A.; Gómez, Victoria Fernández; Figueroa, Sandra B.",Curr Infect Dis Rep,79,3

METHODS: During April to December 2009, we actively searched for persons with severe acute respiratory infection and influenza-like illness (ILI) in three sentinel cities. A proportion of case-patients provided swabs for influenza testing. We estimated the number of case-patients that would have tested positive for influenza by multiplying the number of untested case-patients by the proportion who tested positive. We estimated rates by dividing the estimated number of case-patients by the census population after adjusting for the proportion of case-patients with missing illness onset information and ILI case-patients who visited physicians multiple times for one illness event. RESULTS: We estimated that the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 mortality rate per 100,000 person-years (py) ranged from 1.5 among persons aged 5–44 years to 5.6 among persons aged ≥65 years. A(H1N1)pdm09 hospitalization rates per 100,000 py ranged between 26.9 among children aged <5 years to 41.8 among persons aged ≥65 years. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 ILI rates per 100 py ranged between 1.6 among children aged <5 to 17.1 among persons aged 45–64 years. While 9 (53%) of 17 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 decedents with available data had obesity and 7 (17%) of 40 had diabetes, less than 4% of surviving influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 case-patients had these pre-existing conditions (p≤0.001). CONCLUSION: Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 caused a similar burden of disease in Argentina as in other countries. Such disease burden suggests the potential value of timely influenza vaccinations.","Azziz-Baumgartner, Eduardo; Cabrera, Ana María; Chang, Loretta; Calli, Rogelio; Kusznierz, Gabriela; Baez, Clarisa; Yedlin, Pablo; Zamora, Ana María; Cuezzo, Romina; Sarrouf, Elena Beatriz; Uboldi, Andrea; Herrmann, Juan; Zerbini, Elsa; Uez, Osvaldo; Rico Cordeiro, Pedro Osvaldo; Chavez, Pollyanna; Han, George; Antman, Julián; Coronado, Fatima; Bresee, Joseph; Kosacoff, Marina; Widdowson, Marc-Alain; Echenique, Horacio",PLoS One,79,9

Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is highly expressed in renal tubules and has been shown to be renoprotective in diabetes. The protease, a disintegrin and metalloprotease (ADAM) 17, is involved in the ectodomain shedding of several transmembrane proteins including ACE2. Renal ACE2 and ADAM17 were significantly increased in db/db mice compared to controls. We investigated the effect of the insulin sensitizer, rosiglitazone, on albuminuria, renal ADAM17 protein expression and ACE2 shedding in db/db diabetic mice. Rosiglitazone treatment of db/db mice normalized hyperglycemia, attenuated renal injury and decreased urinary ACE2 and renal ADAM17 protein expression. Urinary excreted ACE2 is enzymatically active. Western blot analysis of urinary ACE2 demonstrated two prominent immunoreactive bands at approximately 70 & 90 kDa. The predominant immunoreactive band is approximately 20 kDa shorter than the one demonstrated for kidney lysate, indicating possible ectodomain shedding of active renal ACE2 in the urine. Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that renoprotection of rosiglitazone could be partially mediated via downregulation of renal ADAM17 and ACE2 shedding. In addition, there was a positive correlation between blood glucose, urinary albumin, plasma glucagon, and triglyceride levels with urinary ACE2 excretion. In conclusion, urinary ACE2 could be used as a sensitive biomarker of diabetic nephropathy and for monitoring the effectiveness of renoprotective medication.","Chodavarapu, Harshita; Grobe, Nadja; Somineni, Hari K.; Salem, Esam S.

Such knowledge is critical in the development of new universal influenza vaccines. METHODS: To study the possibility of the presence of cross-reactive antibodies to influenza viruses which underwent a major antigenic drift between the years 1999 and 2007 sera from samples of 80 children and 400 adults were selected at random from the Israeli national serum bank. The sera was obtained in 2002 and in 2007, two time points that followed a major drift in the infectious H3N2 influenza virus strain (A/Panama/2007/99 to A/Wisconsin/67/2005). RESULTS: In the summer of 2002, 13% of the children had Hemagglutination Inhibition (HI) antibody titers of at least 40 and these antibodies recognized both A/Panama/2007/99 and A/Wisconsin/67/2005, where the latter strain only began to circulate in Israel in 2006. In 2007, 29% of the children had HI antibody titers of at least 40 directed against both A/Wisconsin/67/2005 and A/Panama/2007/99, even though they had never been exposed to the latter virus. Anti-A/Panama/2007/99 antibodies were detected in 58% and 68% of the 2002 and 2007 adult samples, respectively, while 8% and 39% had antibodies against A/Wisconsin/67/2005, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of naturally occurring cross-reactive influenza virus antibodies in a significant percentage of children has important implications for the development of a universal influenza vaccine.","Mandelboim, Michal; Bromberg, Michal; Sherbany, Hilda; Zucker, Inbar; Yaary, Karnit; Bassal, Ravit; Dichtiar, Rita; Cohen, Danny; Shohat, Tamar; Mendelson, Ella; Green, Manfred S",BMC Infect Dis,79,3

The vaccine efficacy (VE) of 1 or 2 doses of AS03-adjuvanted influenza A(H1N1) vaccine relative to that of 2 doses of nonadjuvanted influenza A(H1N1) vaccine in children 6 months to <10 years of age in a multinational study conducted during 2010–2011. Methods. A total of 6145 children were randomly assigned at a ratio of 1:1:1 to receive 2 injections 21 days apart of A/California/7/2009(H1N1)-AS03 vaccine at dose 1 and saline placebo at dose 2, 2 doses 21 days apart of A/California/7/2009(H1N1)-AS03 vaccine (the Ad2 group), or 2 doses 21 days apart of nonadjuvanted A/California/7/2009(H1N1) vaccine (the NAd2 group). Active surveillance for influenza-like illnesses continued from days 14 to 385. Nose and throat samples obtained during influenza-like illnesses were tested for A/California/7/2009(H1N1), using reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Immunogenicity, reactogenicity, and safety were assessed. Results. There were 23 cases of confirmed 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) (A[H1N1]pdm09) infection for the primary relative VE analysis. The VE in the Ad2 group relative to that in the NAd2 group was 76.8% (95% confidence interval, 18.5%–93.4%). The benefit of the AS03 adjuvant was demonstrated in terms of the greater immunogenicity observed in the Ad2 group, compared with the NAd2 group. Conclusion. The 4–8-fold antigen-sparing adjuvanted pandemic influenza vaccine demonstrated superior and clinically important prevention of A(H1N1)pdm09 infection, compared with nonadjuvanted vaccine, with no observed increase in medically attended or serious adverse events.

We describe the largest reported cluster of virologically confirmed H7N9 cases, comprised by a fatal Index case and two mild secondary cases. METHODS: A retrospective investigation was conducted in January of 2014. Three confirmed cases, their close contacts, and relevant environments samples were tested by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), viral culture, and sequencing. Serum samples were tested by haemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay. RESULTS: The Index case, a 49-year-old farmer with type II diabetes, who lived with his daughter (Case 2, aged 24) and wife (Case 3, aged 43) and his son-in-law (H7N9 negative). The Index case and Case 3 worked daily in a live bird market. Onset of illness in Index case occurred in January 13, 2014 and subsequently, he died of multi-organ failure on January 20. Case 2 presented with mild symptoms on January 20 following frequent unprotected bed-side care of the Index case between January 14 to 19, and exposed to live bird market on January 17. Case 3 became unwell on January 23 after providing bedside care to the Index case on January 17 to 18, and following the contact with Case 2 during January 21 to 22 at the funeral of the Index case. The two secondary cases were discharged on February 2 and 5 separately after early treatment with antiviral medication. Four virus strains were isolated and genome analyses showed 99.6 ~100% genetic homology, with two amino mutations (V192I in NS and V280A in NP). 42% (11/26) of environmental samples collected in January were H7N9 positive. Twenty-five close contacts remained well and were negative for H7N9 infection by RT-PCR and HI assay. CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, the Index case was infected from a live bird market while the two secondary cases were infected by the Index case during unprotected exposure. This family cluster is, therefore, compatible with non-sustained person-to-person transmission of avian influenza A/H7N9.

2129,2129,2129,Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2/angiotensin-(1–7)/Mas axis activates Akt signaling to ameliorate hepatic steatosis,13.615557,10.074005,2016-02-17,"The classical axis of renin-angiotensin system (RAS), angiotensin (Ang)-converting enzyme (ACE)/Ang II/AT1, contributes to the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, the role of bypass axis of RAS (Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)/Ang-(1–7)/Mas) in hepatic steatosis is still unclear. Here we showed that deletion of ACE2 aggravates liver steatosis, which is correlated with the increased expression of hepatic lipogenic genes and the decreased expression of fatty acid oxidation-related genes in the liver of ACE2 knockout (ACE2(−/y)) mice. Meanwhile, oxidative stress and inflammation were also aggravated in ACE2(−/y) mice. On the contrary, overexpression of ACE2 improved fatty liver in db/db mice, and the mRNA levels of fatty acid oxidation-related genes were up-regulated. In vitro, Ang-(1–7)/ACE2 ameliorated hepatic steatosis, oxidative stress and inflammation in free fatty acid (FFA)-induced HepG2 cells, and what’s more, Akt inhibitors reduced ACE2-mediated lipid metabolism. Furthermore, ACE2-mediated Akt activation could be attenuated by blockade of ATP/P2 receptor/Calmodulin (CaM) pathway. These results indicated that Ang-(1–7)/ACE2/Mas axis may reduce liver lipid accumulation partly by regulating lipid-metabolizing genes through ATP/P2 receptor/CaM signaling pathway. Our findings support the potential role of ACE2/Ang-(1–7)/Mas axis in prevention and treatment of hepatic lipid metabolism.","Cao, Xi; Yang, Fangyuan; Shi, Tingting; Yuan, Mingxia; Xin, Zhong; Xie, Rongrong; Li, Sen; Li, Hongbing; Yang, Jin-Kui",Sci Rep,79,1

Although rhinovirus appears to occasionally cause severe lower respiratory tract infection in immunocompromised patients, the clinical significance of rhinovirus detection in the lower respiratory tract remains unknown. We evaluated 697 recipients transplanted between 1993 and 2015 with rhinovirus in respiratory samples. As comparative cohorts, 273 recipients with lower respiratory tract infection caused by respiratory syncytial virus (N=117), parainfluenza virus (N=120), or influenza (N=36) were analyzed. Factors associated with mortality were analyzed using Cox proportional hazard models. Among 569 subjects with rhinovirus upper respiratory tract infection and 128 subjects with rhinovirus lower respiratory tract infection, probabilities of overall mortality at 90 days were 6% and 41%, respectively (P<0.001). The survival rate after lower respiratory tract infection was not affected by the presence of co-pathogens (55% in patients with co-pathogens, 64% in patients without, P=0.34). Low monocyte count (P=0.027), oxygen use (P=0.015), and steroid dose greater than 1 mg/kg/day (P=0.003) before diagnosis were significantly associated with mortality among patients with lower respiratory tract infection in multivariable analysis. Mortality after rhinovirus lower respiratory tract infection was similar to that after lower respiratory tract infection by respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus or influenza in an adjusted model. In summary, transplant recipients with rhinovirus detection in the lower respiratory tract had high mortality rates comparable to viral pneumonia associated with other well-established respiratory viruses.

We performed a pilot cross sectional study to assess the feasibility of gas-capillary column ion mobility spectrometer (GC-IMS), for the analysis of volatile organic compounds (VOC) in exhaled breath to diagnose bacterial RTI in hospital inpatients. METHODS: 71 patients were prospectively recruited from the Acute Medical Unit of the Royal Liverpool University Hospital between March and May 2016 and classified as confirmed or probable bacterial or viral RTI on the basis of microbiologic, biochemical and radiologic testing. Breath samples were collected at the patient’s bedside directly into the electronic nose device, which recorded a VOC spectrum for each sample. Sparse principal component analysis and sparse logistic regression were used to develop a diagnostic model to classify VOC spectra as being caused by bacterial or non-bacterial RTI. RESULTS: Summary area under the receiver operator characteristic curve was 0.73 (95% CI 0.61–0.86), summary sensitivity and specificity were 62% (95% CI 41–80%) and 80% (95% CI 64–91%) respectively (p = 0.00147).

In 1918–1919, pandemic influenza spread globally and caused an estimated 50–100 million deaths associated with unexpected clinical and epidemiological features. The descendants of the 1918 virus continue to circulate as annual epidemic viruses causing significant mortality each year. The 1918 influenza pandemic serves as a benchmark for the development of universal influenza vaccines. Challenges to producing a truly universal influenza vaccine include eliciting broad protection against antigenically different influenza viruses that can prevent or significantly downregulate viral replication and reduce morbidity by preventing development of viral and secondary bacterial pneumonia. Perhaps the most important goal of such vaccines is not to prevent influenza, but to prevent influenza deaths.","Morens, David M; Taubenberger, Jeffery K",J Infect Dis,79,3

VLPs represent highly ordered repetitive structures via macromolecular assemblies of viral proteins. The particulate nature allows efficient uptake into antigen presenting cells stimulating both innate and adaptive immune responses towards enhanced vaccine efficacy. Increasing research activity and translation opportunity necessitate the advances in the design of VLPs and new bioprocessing modalities for efficient and cost-effective production.

The genome replication of PRRSV is required to reproduce, within a few hours of infection, the millions of progeny virions that establish, disseminate, and maintain infection. Replication of the viral RNA genome is a multistep process involving a replication complex that is formed not only from components of viral and cellular origin but also from the viral genomic RNA template; this replication complex is embedded within particular virus-induced membrane vesicles. PRRSV RNA replication is directed by at least 14 replicase proteins that have both common enzymatic activities, including viral RNA polymerase, and also unusual and poorly understood RNA-processing functions.

Here, we report on the first 10 patients worldwide who received RATG as part of conditioning. Patients were heterogeneous with regard to diagnoses and graft characteristics. RATG was given in cases of matched unrelated donors, mismatched family donors, reduced conditioning, or high risk for graft failure. Mostly mild allergic reactions toward RATG were seen. All of the patients engrafted in due time. Two died within 2 months of transplant of pulmonary complications not related to RATG. Two developed GVHD grade I, no chronic GVHD was seen to date. Viremia occurred in two, with no viral disease developed. Of the eight patients surviving, one suffered relapse of acute leukemia, one shows impending graft failure. The others are well. Using RATG in conditioning is feasible.","Zimmermann, SY; Klingebiel, T; Koehl, U; Soerensen, J; Schwabe, D",Bone Marrow Transplant,79,7

We conducted a regional retrospective study in the ATL endemic area of Okinawa, Japan. Of 62 ATL patients, 21 received allo-HSCT in CR and 41 in non-CR. The 3-year overall survival (3yOS) rate and median survival time for the whole cohort was 25.6% and 7.7 months, respectively. The 3yOS of Pt-non-CR was significantly lower than that of patients in CR (Pt-CR) (16.8% vs. 43.6%, P = 0.005). Transplant-related mortality (TRM) was significantly higher in Pt-non-CR than in Pt-CR (46.3% vs. 15.7%, P = 0.025), while there was no significant difference in disease-associated mortality (DAM) between Pt-non-CR and Pt-CR. Multivariable analysis for Pt-non-CR revealed that poor performance status (poor-PS) and higher sIL-2R level (high sIL-2R) adversely affected OS. Poor-PS was associated with higher TRM, but not with higher DAM in Pt-non-CR. High sIL-2R did not affect TRM or DAM in Pt-non-CR. Overall, high TRM rates rather than DAM contribute to the poor outcomes of Pt-non-CR, suggesting that not only disease control but also management of transplant-related complications is required for allo-HSCT in ATL patients.","Tomori, Shouhei; Morishima, Satoko; Nishi, Yukiko; Nakachi, Sawako; Tamaki, Keita; Morichika, Kazuho; Tedokon, Iori; Shimabukuro, Natsuki; Hanashiro, Taeko; Kitamura, Sakiko; Uchibori, Sachie; Miyagi, Riko; Miyagi, Takashi; Karimata, Kaori; Ohama, Masayo; Yamanoha, Atsushi; Tomoyose, Takeaki; Karube, Kennosuke; Fukushima, Takuya; Masuzaki, Hiroaki",Bone Marrow Transplant,79,17

Serial blood studies indicated cycling of all blood cell elements, compatible with a diagnosis of cyclic hematopoiesis (CH). He also manifested a progressively severe immune deficiency, not described before in human CH. When first studied at age 5 months, he was hypogammaglobulinaemic with normal B lymphocyte numbers. By 6.5 months, he was agammaglobulinaemic. At age 8 months, he developed severe pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, and studies showed a state of severe combined immune deficiency. The patient received a bone marrow transplant from his HLA-identical sister with no preconditioning therapy. Subsequently, normal immune function developed and the cyclic hematopoiesis resolved. The majority of lymphocytes is of donor origin. Persistence of erythrocytes and neutrophils of recipient origin suggests that the hematopoietic stem cells were not abnormal. We speculate that this patient had a primary deficiency of a differentiation factor affecting maturation of lymphoid and myeloid progenitor cells.","Junker, Anne K.; Poon, Man-Chiu; Hoar, David I.; Rogers, Paul C.

Main causes in Germany are drug toxicity, acetaminophen overdose, and viral hepatitis (A, B, E). For the initial assessment of patients with ALF and the diagnostic algorithm, the early detection of HE, exclusion of liver cirrhosis, immediate diagnosis of the underlying etiology, and evaluation for the necessity of liver transplantation (LT) are critical. Intensive care therapeutic measures aim at preventing or treating complications of ALF. Potentially, plasmapheresis (full plasma exchange) offers a survival benefit for ALF patients who do not undergo LT.

Influenza virus belongs to family Orthomyxoviridae, and has three types A, B and C. Infection by influenza virus A is most common and severe, generally found in humans. It spreads rapidly and affects human population across large geographical region within short period of time with varying degree of pathology from mild to severe. Wild aquatic birds and other animal species like birds, pigs, ferret, horses, seals, whales, mink, giant anteaters, cats and dogs are the reservoir for the influenza A virus. Influenza B and C viruses have very limited host range and appear predominantly in humans. Influenza virus gains pandemic potential through genetic reassortment called “genetic shift” with complete renewal of surface antigen and a small but gradual genetic change by mutations which make it to adapt efficiently in human population called “genetic drift”. Although, the epidemiology related to influenza infection has been studied from several years but some facts associated to disease transmission has poorly understood. This article reviews the important aspects of virological, epidemiological and clinical features related to influenza virus for better understanding of disease transmission and its pathogenesis.","Dangi, Tanushree; Jain, Amita",Proc Natl Acad Sci India Sect B Biol Sci,79,8

The purpose of this study was to evaluate long-term neurodevelopment of patients with SCID following myeloablative chemotherapy and HSCT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixteen pediatric patients diagnosed with SCID were tested using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development and the validated Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (VABS) pre- and 1-year post-HSCT. Three years post-HSCT, there were 11 patients available for testing and four patients available 5 years post-HSCT. Patients greater than 3 years of age were administered the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence. Both raw scores and scaled scores were analyzed. RESULTS: There was a significant decrease 1 year post-HSCT in the Bayley Mental Developmental Index (MDI) [92.5 (pre) vs. 70.81 (1 year post), p < 0.0001] and the VABS [99.73 (pre) vs. 79.87 (1 year post), p = <0.0001]. There was a significant decrease over time in the MDI [95.00 (pre) vs. 72.64 (1 year post) vs. 71.82 (3 years post), p < 0.0001], but no significant change between 1 and 3 years post-HSCT. There was no change in the Bayley Psychomotor Development Scale (PDI) [82.4 (pre) vs. 84.8 (1 year post), p = 0.68]. The PDI scores decreased over time [86.29 (pre) vs. 86 (1 year post) vs. 74.14 (3 years post), p = 0.045]. Although there was a decrease in scaled scores, there was not a loss of skills. Analysis of raw scores showed that there was an increase in the raw test scores, which indicated that these children acquired developmental skills, but at a slower rate than normal infants and toddlers. Younger children had a more significant decrease in adaptive scores compared with older children. CONCLUSIONS: These findings may reflect the effects of the isolation and prolonged hospitalization that characterizes the immediate post-transplant period. Patients miss out on social interactions and learning opportunities that normally occur at their respective stages of development. These restrictions keep patients from acquiring developmentally appropriate cognitive skills as well as gross and fine motor developmental milestones. Longitudinal follow-up will be important to quantify acquisition of skills.","Lin, Malinda; Epport, Karen; Azen, Colleen; Parkman, Robertson; Kohn, Donald B.; Shah, Ami J.",J Clin Immunol,79,3

To describe the current nature of this disease in the UK, data was gathered on patients with clinical pneumonia from whom Streptococcus pyogenes was cultured principally from blood or other relevant normally sterile sites. In the Harrogate and Northallerton districts of North Yorkshire, pneumonia accounted for nine (20%) cases and a quarter of all deaths in a complete sequence of 45 patients with Streptococcus pyogenes bacteraemia detected during the 16-year-period 1981–1996. An analysis is presented of those cases together with eight recent cases from counties York, Durham and Isle of Wight during 1995–1997. Of the total 17 cases, nine occurred in women and eight in men; the age range was 30–92 years. The organism was isolated from blood culture in 15 (88%) patients. Eight (47%) patients died, five within 1 day of hospitalisation. Fourteen (82%) cases occurred in the winter months October to March, including all the fatal cases and all eight in which a clinical 'viral' prodrome was observed. Predisposing medical or surgical conditions were present in 65% of the patients. Major complications included septicaemia, pleural reaction, shock, pulmonary cavitation, osteomyelitis and metastatic abscesses. Seven serotypes of Streptococcus pyogenes were encountered, with M-type 1 predominating (the cause in 60% of cases). All infections were community acquired; two small clusters of fatal pneumonia were seen.","Barnham, M.; Weightman, N. C.; Anderson, A. W.; Pagan, F. S.; Chapman, S.

In 2009 serologic responses to either pandemic H1N1 (2009) vaccine (n = 36) or pandemic H1N1 (2009) infection (n = 2) were studied in 38 HSCT recipients. METHODS: Responses were measured with a standard hemagglutination-inhibition assay. Fourteen patients had active chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGvHD) at the time of vaccination/infection and seven patients had cGvHD in remission; 11 patients had no immunosuppressive therapy, and 27 patients were on immunosuppressive therapy. Nineteen patients (53%) responded to pandemic H1N1 (2009) vaccination. Two patients had pandemic H1N1 (2009) infection without prior vaccination, and one patient had severe pandemic H1N1 (2009) infection with acute respiratory distress syndrome despite prior single vaccination. RESULTS: Non-responders to pandemic H1N1 (2009) vaccination more often had cGvHD (65 vs. 53%) and received second- or third-line therapy (53 vs. 11%), while responders mostly had first-line therapy for cGvHD. While vaccine responders had no or single agent immunosuppressive therapy, non-responders frequently received moderate or intense immunosuppressive therapy. All vaccine recipients previously treated with rituximab were non-responders. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, the overall response to pandemic H1N1 (2009) vaccination in HSCT recipients was modest. Patients receiving combined immunosuppressive therapy for steroid-refractory cGvHD barely responded to pandemic H1N1 (2009) vaccination.","Roll, D.; Ammer, J.; Holler, B.; Salzberger, B.; Schweiger, B.; Jilg, W.; Andreesen, R.; Edinger, M.; Wolff, D.; Holler, E.",Infection,79,3

The present study was carried out in order to investigate the clinical courses and outcomes of adult dengue and scrub typhus patients with ARF, and to identify the clinical differences between adult dengue and scrub typhus patients with ARF. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of the serologically confirmed adult dengue or scrub typhus patients admitted between 1998 and 2008 at Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. A total of 980 dengue and 102 scrub typhus adult patients were included in our study. RESULTS: Eighteen of the 980 adult dengue patients and 8 of the 102 adult scrub typhus patients had ARF.

C. Easterday and E. H. Weinberg, University of Wisconsin.* Recently there has been much interest in isoprinosine as a broad-spectrum antiviral compound. The activity of this substance was evaluated in a coordinated study at five institutions. Experimental models in five species of animals were established using 11 viruses. Criteria for selection were: (l) representation of most major groups of viruses, (2) reproduction of natural routes of infection, and (3) simulation of potentially treatable viral infections of man. No therapeutic effect could be demonstrated in infections with encephalomyocarditis virus, type 2 Herpesvirus hominis, influenza, and rabies viruses in mice; vaccinia virus in rabbits; rhinotracheitis and panleukopenia viruses in cats; distemper virus in ferrets; and influenza and transmissible gastroenteritis viruses in swine. The only antiviral activity observed in this extensive series of experiments was suppression of fibroma virus lesions in rabbits given 600 mg/ kg per day of isoprinosine. Although antiviral activity is not precluded in other viral infections in animals or in man, these results clearly fail to substantiate the potential of isoprinosine as a potent, broad-spectrum antiviral substance.","Glasgow, L.

Human leukocytes produce different patterns of inflammatory mediators in vitro when stimulated with Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, respectively. Here, we investigated the cytokine and prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) responses in middle ear fluids (MEFs) from children with spontaneously perforated AOM, and related the mediator levels to the presence of pathogens detected by culture (live) or PCR (live or dead). Furthermore, the in vivo cytokine pattern was compared with that induced in leukocytes stimulated by dead bacteria in vitro. MEFs with culturable pathogenic bacteria contained more interleukin (IL)-1β (median: 110 μg/L vs. <7.5 μg/L), tumour necrosis factor (TNF) (6.3 μg/L vs. <2.5 μg/L), IL-8 (410 μg/L vs. 38 μg/L) and IL-10 (0.48 μg/L vs. <0.30 μg/L) than culture-negative fluids, irrespective of PCR findings. IL-6 and PGE(2) were equally abundant (69–110 μg/L) in effusions with live, dead or undetectable bacteria. Cytokine levels were unrelated to bacterial species and to the presence or absence of virus. Similar levels of TNF and IL-6 as found in the MEFs were obtained by in vitro stimulation of leukocytes, whereas 11 times more IL-1β and 3.5 times more IL-8 were produced in vivo, and 22 times more IL-10 was produced in vitro. Vigorous production of proinflammatory cytokines accompanies AOM with membrane rupture, regardless of the causative agent, but the production seems to cease rapidly once the bacteria are killed and fragmented. IL-6 and PGE(2), however, remain after bacterial disintegration, and may play a role in the resolution phase.","Skovbjerg, S.; Roos, K.; Nowrouzian, F.; Lindh, M.; Holm, S.E.; Adlerberth, I.; Olofsson, S.; Wold, A.E.",Clin Microbiol Infect,79,3

Lymphocytes from any healthy donor, as well as peripheral blood and spleen lymphocytes from several experimental animals, in the absence of known or deliberate sensitization, were found to be spontaneously cytotoxic in vitro for some normal fresh cells, most cultured cell lines, immature hematopoietic cells, and tumor cells. This type of nonadaptive, non-MHC-restricted cellmediated cytotoxicity was defined as “natural” cytotoxicity, and the effector cells mediating natural cytotoxicity were functionally defined as natural killer (NK) cells. The existence of NK cells has prompted a reinterpretation of both the studies of specific cytotoxicity against spontaneous human tumors and the theory of immune surveillance, at least in its most restrictive interpretation. Unlike cytotoxic T cells, NK cells cannot be demonstrated to have clonally distributed specificity, restriction for MHC products at the target cell surface, or immunological memory. NK cells cannot yet be formally assigned to a single lineage based on the definitive identification of a stem cell, a distinct anatomical location of maturation, or unique genotypic rearrangements.","Trinchieri, Giorgio",Adv Immunol,79,9

Isolation of rhinoviruses occurs in a distinct and consistent seasonal pattern that can be used to help determine whether an acute respiratory illness is caused by a rhinovirus. Objective: This article reviews information on the seasonality of rhinovirus infection derived from early and recent studies of rhinovirus occurrence and treatment. Methods: PubMed was searched from 1965 to the present to identify all potentially relevant papers. The search terms used were rhinovirus and seasonality. A total of 1998 papers were screened. Results: Rhinoviruses comprise more than three quarters of viruses circulating in early autumn. In some years and perhaps some geographic areas, spring is an even more important time for rhinovirus transmission. Although overall rates of respiratory illness are lower in summer, rhinoviruses are the most frequently isolated virus at this time of year. Other viral agents, including influenza viruses and respiratory syncytial virus (particularly with parainfluenza virus), predominate in the winter. Thus, for most of the year, rhinoviruses are the cause of the majority of acute viral respiratory infections. Conclusion: Understanding the seasonal incidence of rhinovirus infection may help determine how best to employ currently available antirhinoviral agents in patients presenting with symptoms of an acute viral respiratory infection.","Monto, Arnold S.",Clin Ther,79,1

Advances in our understanding of the immunologic processes that undergird a normal pregnancy, studies from vaccines currently available and recommended for pregnant women, and vaccines for administration in special situations are beginning to build the case for safe scale-up of maternal immunization. In addition to well-known diseases, new diseases are emerging which pose threats. Several new vaccines are currently under development and increasingly include pregnant women. In this manuscript, targeted at clinicians, vaccinologists, scientists, public health practitioners, and policymakers, we also outline key considerations around maternal immunization introduction and delivery, discuss noninfectious horizons for maternal immunization, and provide a framework for the clinician faced with immunizing a pregnant woman.","Engmann, Cyril; Fleming, Jessica A.; Khan, Sadaf; Innis, Bruce L.; Smith, Jeffrey M.; Hombach, Joachim; Sobanjo-ter Meulen, Ajoke",J Perinatol,79,3

Emerging data show that prior immunization with an immunologically distinct hemagglutinin of the same subtype offers the potential to “prime” recipients for rapid protection with a booster dose, years later, of a vaccine then manufactured to match the pandemic strain. This article proposes making prepandemic priming vaccine(s) available for voluntary use, particularly to those at high risk of early occupational exposure, such as first responders and healthcare workers, and to others maintaining critical infrastructure. In addition to providing faster protection and potentially reducing social disruption, being able, early in a pandemic, to immunize those who had received prepandemic vaccine with one dose of the pandemic vaccine, rather than the 2 doses typically required, would reduce the total doses of pandemic vaccine then needed, extending vaccine supplies.","Goodman, Jesse L.",Clin Infect Dis,79,3

In Vietnam, PED first emerged in 2009 and has now developed to an endemic stage. This is the first cross-sectional survey performed to evaluate the proportion of PEDV-positive swine farms in Vietnam from January 2018 to February 2019. Fecal samples from 327 pig farms in northern Vietnam were collected and tested for PEDV infection by reverse transcription-loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) method. The proportion of PEDV-positive farms was 30.9% and PEDV-positive farms were distributed throughout the study area. The highest proportion of PEDV-positive farms was 70% (7/10) among nucleus production type farms (P < 0.05). Higher proportions of PEDV-positive farms were found in the Northeast and Red River Delta areas, which are the major areas of pig production (P < 0.05). The proportion of PEDV-positive farms was higher among larger farms (P < 0.05). Our findings illustrate the high proportion of PEDV-positive farms in the Vietnamese pig population and will help to better understand the epidemiological dynamics of PED infection, to estimate impact, and establish and improve prevention and control measures.

Compared to pristine devices, the toluene SVA-treated devices exhibit an order of magnitude responsivity enhancement to 10 ppm NO(2), further with a limit of detection of 148 ppb. Systematic studies on the microstructure of the TIPS-pentacene films reveal the large density grain boundaries formed by the SVA process, improving the capability for the adsorption of gas molecules, thus causing high-sensitivity to NO(2). This simple SVA processing strategy provides an effective and reliable access for realizing high-sensitivity OTFT NO(2) sensors.","Hou, Sihui; Zhuang, Xinming; Fan, Huidong; Yu, Junsheng",Sensors (Basel),79,8

Antibiotic resistance kills an estimated 700,000 people each year worldwide, and this number is expected to increase dramatically if efforts are not made to develop new drugs or alternative containment strategies. Increased vaccination coverage, improved sanitation or sustained implementation of infection control measures are among the possible areas of action. Indeed, vaccination is one of the most effective tools of preventing infections. Starting from 1970s polysaccharide-based vaccines against Meningococcus, Pneumococcus and Haemophilus influenzae type b have been licensed, and provided effective protection for population. However, the development of safe and effective vaccines for infectious diseases with broad coverage remains a major challenge in global public health. In this scenario, nanosystems are receiving attention as alternative delivery systems to improve vaccine efficacy and immunogenicity. In this report, we provide an overview of current applications of glyconanomaterials as alternative platforms in the development of new vaccine candidates. In particular, we will focus on nanoparticle platforms, used to induce the activation of the immune system through the multivalent-displacement of saccharide antigens.

The factors affecting women’s exposure to economic violence were determined using the binary logistic regression analysis. In the study, women in the 15–24, 25–34 and 35–44 age group had a higher ratio of exposure to economic violence compared to the reference group. Women who graduated from elementary school, secondary school, and high school had a higher ratio of exposure to economic violence compared to those who have never gone to school. Women’s exposure to physical, sexual and verbal violence was also important factor affecting women’s exposure to economic violence. The results obtained in this study are important in that they can be a source of information for establishing policies and programs to prevent violence against women.

In this paper, findings are presented from a cross-sectional survey of Australian PLHIV, which included the Berger (HIV) stigma scale. A total of 872 PLHIV completed the survey, of which 48 (6.0%) were bisexual men. Bisexual men reported higher levels of internalised HIV-related stigma, greater negative self-image and poorer emotional wellbeing than gay men. Bisexual men also reported less social support, less connection with lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) communities, and less connection with other PLHIV. Analysis of data from an open-text question revealed feelings of social isolation and fear of rejection was associated with participant’s HIV diagnosis.

METHODS: Sixty male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three sham groups and seven model groups. A metal clip was placed on the ascending aorta in the model group to establish PH-LHD rat model. The sham group received a similar operation without ascending aorta clamped. On day 25, pulmonary vein was given mechanical stretching with 0 g, 2.0 g tension in two model groups and two sham groups. Another four model groups were given 2.0 g tension after MAPKs pathway inhibitors soaked. The last sham group and model group rats’ pulmonary veins, pulmonary artery and lung tissues were obtained on day 35. Pulmonary vein, pulmonary artery and lung tissue were evaluated by echocardiography, HE staining, immunohistochemistry and western blotting respectively. RESULTS: On day 25, left heart weight, right ventricular pressure (35.339 cmH(2)O) and left atrial pressure (13.657 cmH(2)O) were increased in model group than those in sham group. Echocardiography showed left heart failure in the PH-LHD group (Interventrieular septum dimension 1.716 mm, left ventricular internal end diastolic dimension 4.888 mm, left ventricular posterior wall thickness in diastole 1.749 mm, ejection fraction 76.917%). But there was no difference in lung tissue between the sham group and PH-LHD group as showed by HE staining. Our results showed that the expression of IL-6 and TNF-α was highly expressed in PH-LHD rats’ serum and pulmonary vein, which were further increased after 2.0 g tension was given and were decreased after SAC/MAPKs inhibitors treatment. Meanwhile, on day 25, immunohistochemistry analysis showed the expression of IL-6 and TNF-α was higher in the PH-LHD rats’ pulmonary vein than that in pulmonary artery and lung tissue, and these expressions in pulmonary vein of PH-LHD group were also higher than that in sham group. However, on day 35, IL-6 and TNF-α were all increased in the pulmonary veins, arteries and lung tissues. Besides, our results uncovered that SAC/MAPKs pathway were upregulating in PH-LHD rats’ pulmonary vein. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, pulmonary vein mechanical stretching exacerbated PH-LHD possibly through the SAC/MAPKs pathway and upregulating expression of IL-6 and TNF-α.","Huang, Wenhui; Liu, Hongjin; Pan, Yichao; Yang, Hongwei; Lin, Jing; Zhang, Hui",J Cardiothorac Surg,79,8

Nucleotide composition is the simplest way of characterizing genomes. Despite this simplicity, it has several implications. Indeed, it is the main factor that determines, among other features, dinucleotide frequencies, repeated short DNA sequences, and codon and amino acid usage. Which forces drive this strong variation is still a matter of controversy. For rather obvious reasons, most of the studies concerning this huge variation and its consequences, have been done in free-living organisms. However, no recent comprehensive study of all known viruses has been done (that is, concerning all available sequences). Viruses, by far the most abundant biological entities on Earth, are the causative agents of many diseases. An overview of these entities is important also because their genetic material is not always double-stranded DNA: indeed, certain viruses have as genetic material single-stranded DNA, double-stranded RNA, single-stranded RNA, and/or retro-transcribing. Therefore, one may wonder if what we have learned about the evolution of GC content and its implications in prokaryotes and eukaryotes also applies to viruses. In this contribution, we attempt to describe compositional properties of ∼ 10,000 viral species: base composition (globally and according to Baltimore classification), correlations among non-coding regions and the three codon positions, and the relationship of the nucleotide frequencies and codon usage of viruses with the same feature of their hosts. This allowed us to determine how the base composition of phages strongly correlate with the value of their respective hosts, while eukaryotic viruses do not (with fungi and protists as exceptions). Finally, we discuss some of these results concerning codon usage: reinforcing previous results, we found that phages and hosts exhibit moderate to high correlations, while for eukaryotes and their viruses the correlations are weak or do not exist.","Simón, Diego; Cristina, Juan; Musto, Héctor",Front Microbiol,79,1

Colistin-induced nephrotoxicity is one of the major adverse reactions during colistin treatment. Comparisons of colistin-induced nephrotoxicity between different formulations of colistin are rarely reported. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we enrolled intensive care unit–admitted patients if they had culture isolates of CR-GNB and underwent intravenous treatment with colistin. The occurrence of acute kidney injury (AKI) during intravenous treatment with colistin was recorded. The occurrence of colistin-induced nephrotoxicity was compared between two formulations of colistin, Locolin®, and Colimycin®. Treatment outcomes associated with the occurrence of colistin-induced nephrotoxicity were also investigated. RESULTS: Among 195 patients, 95 who were treated with Locolin® and 100 who were treated with Colimycin® were included for analysis. Patients treated with Locolin® had a higher rate of occurrence of stage 2 (46.3% vs. 32%, p = 0.040) and stage 3 (29.5% vs. 13%, p = 0.005) AKI than did those treated with Colimycin®. In multivariate analysis, the presence of septic shock (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.17, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.10–4.26) and inappropriate colistin dosage (aOR 2.52, 95% CI 1.00–6.33) were clinical factors associated with colistin-induced nephrotoxicity. Treatment with Colimycin® was an independent factor associated with a lower risk of colistin-induced nephrotoxicity (aOR 0.37, 95% CI 0.18–0.77). The mortality rate was comparable between patients with and without colistin-induced nephrotoxicity. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of colistin-induced nephrotoxicity significantly varied in different formulations of colistin in critically ill patients. Colistin-induced nephrotoxicity was not associated with increased mortality rate.

Rapid diagnostic tests provide collaborative opportunities for antimicrobial stewardship Teams (AST) to improve patient outcomes and decrease antimicrobial use. In January of 2017 our institution initiated use of a FDA approved multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) Respiratory Panel. The objective of this evaluation was to assess the clinical impact along with procalcitonin (PCT) on quality of patient care when used in conjunction with antimicrobial stewardship. METHODS: Molecular testing was performed using the BioFire FilmArray® Respiratory Panel [RP] (BioMerieux). The medical staff was encouraged to order an Influenza/RSV PCR test prior to ordering the full RP. The results of RP and PCT were available the same day as ordered. AST recommended the RP as part of its intervention on several patients and provided advice based on results. RESULTS: From January-April the results of 81 tests for the respiratory panel were evaluated. Of these 30 were positive (+) for virus (most common-Human Metapneumovirus [HMV]-13, Coronavirus-7). PCT (ng/mL) results were available on 69. Most common final diagnosis: Pneumonia-31; AECOPD-16. Effect on duration of antimicrobial therapy (ABX) and hospital length of stay (LOS): CONCLUSION: The results of the RP led to a decrease in ABX duration, which was most profound in the patients for whom AST intervened.

It is also associated with severe respiratory symptoms in infants, elderly, and immunocompromised patients. Our previous results showed that the expression of antiviral genes in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells is downregulated in the presence of HCoV-OC43 proteins. To understand the role of HCoV-OC43 proteins in antagonizing antiviral responses of the host, we investigated the effect of HCoV-OC43 structural and accessory proteins on the transcriptional activation of interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE), interferon-β (IFN-β) promoter, and nuclear factor kappa B response element (NF-kappaB-RE). METHODS: HCoV-OC43 ns2a, ns5a, membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) mRNA were amplified and cloned into the pAcGFP1-N expression vector, followed by transfection in HEK-293 cells. Two days post-transfection, the cells were co-transfected with a reporter vector containing firefly luciferase under the control of ISRE, IFN-β promoter, or NF-kappaB-RE. Renilla luciferase vector was used as an internal control for transfection efficiency. Following 24 hours of incubation, the cells were treated with either IFN or tumour necrosis factor (TNF) for 6 hours. Thereafter, promoter activity was assayed using the dual-luciferase reporter assay system. Influenza NS1 protein was used as positive control for antagonism. RESULTS: The transcriptional activity of ISRE, IFN-β promoter, and NF-kappaB-RE was downregulated in the presence of ns2a, ns5a, M, or N protein as there was a sharp fall in firefly luciferase levels. Overall, HCoV-OC43 proteins reduced firefly luciferase levels for ISRE and IFN-β promoter by at least ten fold, whereas for NF-kappaB-RE the firefly luciferase levels were reduced by at least fivefold. CONCLUSION: HCoV-OC43 has the ability to block the activation of different antiviral signaling pathways.

We describe the epidemiology of respiratory viruses and infection prevention and control interventions aimed to reduce acquisition and transmission of respiratory viruses in our NICU. METHODS: From May 2012 to December 2016, we tracked respiratory viruses detected by a multiplex reverse-transcriptase (RT)-PCR assay (FilmArray, Biofire, Inc.) in our 58-bed level IV NICU (~1,000 annual admissions). Testing was ordered by treating clinicians for symptomatic infants. Infants with positive RT-PCR tests generally remained on contact/ droplet precautions throughout their NICU stay. HCP were instructed not to work sick and report to Workforce Health and Safety if they became ill at work. Ill visitors were not permitted in the NICU, as enforced by written educational materials and signage, but formal screening was not performed. Starting in January 2015, asymptomatic infants exposed to RT-PCR-positive index cases were screened by RT-PCR, put on contact/ droplet precautions for the incubation period (IP) of the index case’s virus, and screened again at IP end. Starting in December 2015, visitors <12 years old were banned year-round. We assessed dyad transmission events (2 infants), clusters (3 infants), and outbreaks (>3 infants); all were defined as detecting geographically related cases within the relevant IP. We determined screened infants who had positive RT-PCR tests. RESULTS: During the 56 month observation period, 79 infants had 83 viruses detected (~1.8% of admissions). Rhino/ enterovirus (RV/EV) were most common (n = 59) and caused 1 outbreak of 7 infants, 4 clusters, and 5 dyad transmissions. Adenovirus caused 1 outbreak of 5 infants. Two dyad transmissions occurred for parainfluenza. Sporadic cases of RSV (n = 5), coronavirus (n = 5), and influenza (n = 2) occurred. Ill household contacts were identified for 10 infants. No HCPs were identified with respiratory illnesses. Since January 2015, 8 screened infants had positive RT-PCR tests. Since December 2015, only 1 transmission dyad (RV/EV) occurred.

Although many good medication adherence monitoring methods/techniques exist, the level of medication adherence for some chronic diseases by patients in rural settings is still suboptimal. Hence, the need for healthcare organisations to devise viable governance frameworks that will facilitate effective medication adherence monitoring and improved adherence by patients. This paper presents the conceptual overview of a governance framework for medication adherence monitoring and improvement that enables the collaboration of multiple stakeholders and data analytics (MUCODAF) in support of the patient in the treatment journey. The framework allows relevant stakeholders such as Healthcare workers (HCW), family members, and close friends to collaborate in support of a patient through the engagement of critical human factors such as empathy, motivation, encouragement, flexibility, and negotiation. The use cases of the framework, its technical composition, and the implementation plan are discussed in this paper. A concrete example of the application of the governance framework for medication adherence monitoring and improvement for a Tuberculosis patient in the African Country of Lesotho is presented to highlight the plausibility of the framework.","Daramola, Olawande; Nyasulu, Peter","Responsible Design, Implementation and Use of Information and Communication Technology",79,28

Bei bestimmten Infektionskrankheiten sind die klinischen Symptome und Organveränderungen nicht auf die direkte Wirkung des Infektionserregers zurückzuführen. Vielmehr entwickeln sich nach Ablagerung oder örtlicher Bildung von pathogenen Immunkomplexen in einer Reihe von Zielorganen charakteristische Entzündungsprozesse; es entsteht die Immunkomplexkrankheit. 2. In zahlreichen Beobachtungen an Spontankrankheiten sowie in tier‐experimentellen Untersuchungen konnte geklärt werden, welche Faktoren für die Entstehung, biologische Wirkung, Elimination und Lokalisation von Immunkomplexen im Gewebe maßgebend sind. Die wichtigsten, die Pathogenität von Immunkomplexen bestimmenden Faktoren sind die Art des Antigens, Klasse und Subklasse des Immunglobulins, das molare Verhältnis zwischen Antigen und Antikörper, die Produktionsrate und Verfügbarkeit der beiden Immunreaktanten sowie der Funktionszustand des RES. Weiterhin könnten genetische Faktoren bedeutsam sein, da sie die Menge des produzierten Anti‐körpers sowie dessen Affinität zum Antigen determinieren. 3. Die pathogene, insbesondere entzündungserregende Wirkung von Immunkomplexen beruht auf ihrer Fähigkeit, das Komplementsystem zu aktivieren, d. h. der Bildung von biologisch aktiven Komplementspaltprodukten; mit Fc‐Rezeptoren auf Thrombozyten, neutrophilen und eosinophilen Granulozyten und Makrophagen zu reagieren; sowie Mediatoren des Kinin‐Systems zu aktivieren. 4. Die Lokalisation zirkulierender Immunkomplexe im Gewebe wird entscheidend bestimmt durch die Größe der Immunkomplexe, das molare Verhältnis von Antigen zu Antikörper, die hämodynamischen Verhältnisse am Ablagerungsort, die örtliche Erhöhung der Gefäßpermeabilität durch vasoaktive Mediatoren und für die Niere das Vorhandensein von C 3 b‐Rezeptoren in den Glomerula. Immunkomplexen kommt eine gewisse Bedeutung als Regulatoren der zellvermittelten und humoralen Immunantwort zu, da sie mit Zellen, die Fc‐ und C‐Rezeptoren tragen, in Reaktion treten können und die Immunantwort teils verstärken, teils supprimieren. 5. Zirkulierende Immunkomplexe wirken pathogen nach Ablagerung in bestimmten Zielorganen wie Nierenglomerula, Gefäßwänden, Plexus chorioideus, Synovialis und Haut, und nach Aktivierung humoraler und zellulärer Mediatoren. Als Ursachen einer langen Persistenz von Immunkomplexen in der Zirkulation werden eine mangelhafte Elimination durch das Monozyten‐Makrophagen‐System, Mangel an bestimmten Komplementfaktoren, ein für die Phagozytose ungünstiges Antigen‐Antikorper‐Verhältnis sowie der Grad der Antikörper‐Affinität diskutiert. 6. Die Entwicklung neuer Methoden zum Nachweis von Immunkomplexen in biologischen Flüssigkeiten und im Gewebe hat zur Klärung der primären Bedeutung von Immunkomplexen bei der Entstehung von Krankheiten bei Mensch und Tieren geführt. Bei einzelnen Krankheiten konnte nach Identifizierung von Antigenen in isolierten Immunkomplexen auch die Ätiologie weiter aufgeklärt werden. SUMMARY: Immune‐complex diseases in man and animals 1. In certain infectious diseases the clinical signs and changes in organs are not due to the direct effects of the infectious agent. After deposition or local formation of pathogenic immune complexes there develop in a series of target organs characteristic inflammatory processes; an immune complex disease develops. 2. From numerous observations of spontaneous diseases as well as experimental studies it is possible to explain which factors are responsible for the development, biological effects, elimination and localization of immune complexes in the tissues. The most important factors responsible for determining the pathogenicity of immune complexes are the nature of the antigen, class and sub‐class of immunoglobulin, molar relationship between antigen and antibody, rate of production and availability of both immune reactants, and the functional state of the reticulo‐endothelial system. In addition, genetic factors may be important since they determine the amount of antibody produced as well as its affinity for the antigen. 3. The pathogenic, especially the inflammation‐stimulating action, of immune complexes rests on their ability to activate the complement system i. e. the formation of biologically active complement breakdown products; to react with Fc‐receptors on thrombocytes, neutrophil and eosinophil granulocytes and macrophages; and also to activate mediators of the kinin system. 4. The localization of circulating immune complexes in tissues is determined by the size of the immune complex, the molar relations between antigen and antibody, the haemodynamic relationships in the area of deposition, the local increase in vascular permeability caused by vaso‐active mediators, and, in the case of the kidney, by the presence of C 3 b‐receptors in the glomeruli. Immune complexes have some significance as regulators of cell‐mediated and humoral responses since they can react with cells which carry Fc and C receptors and can sometimes increase and at other times reduce the immune response. 5. Circulating immune complexes have a pathogenic effect after deposition in certain target organs such as renal glomeruli, vessel walls, choroid plexus, synovial membranes and skin, as well as after activation of humoral and cellular mediators. The reasons for the continuing persistence of immune complexes in the circulation are deficient elimination by the monocyte‐macrophage system, lack of certain complement factors, an antigen‐antibody relationship unfavourable for phagocytosis, and the degree of antibody affinity; these various reasons are discussed. 6. The development of new methods to detect immune complexes in biological fluids and in tissues has resulted in explaining the primary importance of immune complexes in the development of diseases in man and animals. In some diseases the aetiology can be further explained after indentifying the antigens in isolated immune complexes.","Trautwein, G.",J Vet Med B Infect Dis Vet Public Health,79,1

Villages are non-profit, membership-based organizations that provide support from volunteers and social connections to enable aging in place. We distributed on-line surveys to the leaders of the 287 Villages in the national network to capture the effects of the pandemic on organizational operations, membership recruitment, service provision, and member well-being. A 40% response rate (n=116) was obtained. A majority of Villages reported that the pandemic greatly affected the organization, with the top concerns being: 1) membership recruitment, 2) the health and well-being of members and volunteers and 3) connecting with their members outside of normal in-person events. Over half of the respondents reported that the mental health of members had declined; and there were high levels of disruption to usual health care. New member recruitment efforts were thwarted and most Villages lost revenue. About 70% offered virtual programming but, in general, participation in these on-line events dropped. From the survey respondents’ perspective, the value of the Village to members and their family increased (48%) or remained the same (22%). New opportunities emerged that may be continued post-pandemic: new meal and medicine delivery volunteer services, more on-line communication and telephone reassurance, and new family and community connections. Findings indicate a wide range of experiences during the pandemic, with variation stemming from age of the Village and size of membership. The study informs the sustainability and growth efforts of Villages during and after the pandemic.","Galucia, Natalie; Morrow-Howell, Nancy; Sun, Peter; Meyer, Tanner; Li, Ying",Innov Aging,79,22

Burden of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) and Other Lower Respiratory Tract Viral Infections During the First Two Years of Life: a Prospective Study,13.357404,10.253547,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: In Michigan, 44,964 (68%) of the 66,269 COVID-19 patients have recovered. However, there is concern that COVID-19 infection may lead to long-term sequelae, including pulmonary defects, cardiac complications, blood clots, and neurocognitive impairment. This study describes the 30-day outcomes of patients who had recovered. METHODS: From 3/16/2020 to 5/19/2020, a follow-up was attempted for patients who were discharged alive from Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit and had recovered. Recovery was defined as being alive 30 days post symptom-onset. A telephone survey was conducted 30 days post-index admission and recorded in electronic medical records. Oxygen (O2) requirements, symptoms, readmissions and the need for antibiotics for secondary bacterial infections were evaluated. RESULTS: 585 patients met inclusion criteria and were contacted by phone; 303 answered their phone (Table 1), but only 266 (45%) completed a full telephone encounter and were included in the final analysis (Table 2). The majority were female (53%), black (80%), and discharged to home (84%). The clinical characteristics of those who completed the survey were as follows: 11% presented with O2 saturation < 90%, 16% had underlying lung pathology, and 57% had a BMI above 30. Patients’ average age was 61 ± 14.3 years. At 30 days post-index admission, 49% were still symptomatic. Of the symptomatic patients, 86% had dyspnea on exertion and 15% required O2 supplementation. 18% of patients were readmitted within 30 days, and 9% developed a secondary infection prior to the phone encounter. No statistically significant differences in demographics or comorbidities were found between symptomatic and asymptomatic cohorts (Tables 1, 2). [Image: see text] [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: In our study, almost half of the discharged patients remained symptomatic after 30 days with a substantial proportion experiencing pulmonary symptoms. A better understanding of the long-term pulmonary sequelae following COVID-19 infection is needed to design interventions to reduce post-infectious morbidity.

The hemagglutinin gene was amplified and sequenced. We identified amino acid (AA) changes and computed antigenic relatedness using the P(epitope) model. Phylogenetic analyses revealed multiple clades/subclades of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) were circulating simultaneously and evolved away from their vaccine strain, but not the influenza B virus. The predominant circulating strains of A(H1N1)pdm09 belonged to 6B.1A1 (2017–2018) and 6B.1A5 (2019–2020) with additional AA substitutions. Clade 3C.2a1b and 3C.2a2 viruses co-circulated in A(H3N2) and clade 3C.3a virus was found in 2020. The B/Victoria-like lineage predominated since 2019 with an additional three AA deletions. Antigenic drift was dominantly facilitated at epitopes Sa and Sb of A(H1N1)pdm09, epitopes A, B, D and E of A(H3N2), and the 120 loop and 190 helix of influenza B virus. Moderate computed antigenic relatedness was observed in A(H1N1)pdm09. The computed antigenic relatedness of A(H3N2) indicated a significant decline in 2019 (9.17%) and 2020 (− 18.94%) whereas the circulating influenza B virus was antigenically similar (94.81%) with its vaccine strain. Our findings offer insights into the genetic divergence from vaccine strains, which could aid vaccine updating.","Suntronwong, Nungruthai; Klinfueng, Sirapa; Korkong, Sumeth; Vichaiwattana, Preeyaporn; Thongmee, Thanunrat; Vongpunsawad, Sompong; Poovorawan, Yong",Sci Rep,79,1

We conducted eight monthly virtual focus groups and one virtual workshop with patients, caregivers, and researchers to explore key constructs to inform the model. Discussions were facilitated by Patient Co-Investigators. Participants developed a definition of hope and identified promotors and inhibitors that influence the experience of hope. We utilized qualitative methods to analyze findings and organize the promotors and inhibitors of hope within three strata of the socio-ecologic framework: structural, interpersonal, and intrapersonal. Participants identified three types of interventions to promote hope: resources, navigation, and activities to promote social connection. The hope conceptual model can be used to inform the selection of interventions to assess in future research studies aimed at improving hope and the specification of outcome measures to include in hope research studies.

Here, we first determine functional monomers that can yield a doxycycline-imprinted hydrogel based on the hydrogen bond interactions at the prepolymerization step, revealed by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, molecular docking, and simulated annealing methods. Then, acrylic acid (AA)-based doxycycline (DOX) imprinted (MIP) and non-imprinted (NIP) hydrogels are synthesized in cross-linker ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) ratios of 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 3.0 mol%.

However, at 3.0 mol% EGDMA, AA attains numerous stable hydrogen bond interactions with the drug.

While the national economics itself is still growing and advancing, the mitigation policies are expected to slow down the economy at some level. This study is trying to examine the potential impact of the emission mitigation policies on the Indonesian economy by utilizing a dynamic computable general equilibrium (CGE). The simulation result showed that the implementation of comprehensive mitigation technology would cause a GDP loss of around 1.7% by 2030 compared to the BAU level. If we look at the sectoral GDP, the agriculture sector is projected to experiencing the most significant shock by the emission mitigation policies (− 13.4% compared to BAU level by 2030). But the energy sector might become a sector experiencing higher GDP under the mitigation action (3.5% compared to BAU level by 2030). It also showed that the utilization of renewable energies for power generation would increase significantly, especially after 2025, but still cannot fully replace the dominance of fossil fuel sources. There are several policy recommendations based on our simulation results, including that the government also needs to increase efficiency in using fossil fuels, especially coal and gas, during the process of building infrastructure for renewable energy utilization. In terms of employment, the government needs to prepare other sectors to absorb labor, especially from the agricultural sector. Another crucial thing is that considering the possible economic impact, especially in the mid-term period, the government needs to implement necessary mitigation policies immediately. Otherwise, the government may need to prepare more expenditure to introduce more technologies and policies in the future.","Malahayati, Marissa; Masui, Toshihiko",Mitig Adapt Strateg Glob Chang,79,26

Because of the physical properties of heliox, mechanical ventilation with this gas mixture may offer advantages in the management of respiratory failure associated with meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS). OBJECTIVES The purpose of this pilot study was to assess the effect of short-term mechanical ventilation with heliox in newborns with MAS on vital signs, oxygenation, acid-base balance and respiratory function parameters. METHODS The study was carried out in newborns with respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation due to MAS. Eight patients were ventilated using pressure-controlled synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation. Parameters of respiratory function, oxygenation, acid-base balance and vital signs were recorded at baseline, then twice during 1 h of heliox ventilation and finally twice during 1 h after switching back to air-oxygen ventilation. RESULTS Mechanical ventilation with heliox did not affect vital signs and the infants' clinical condition remained stable during the study. Heliox ventilation was associated with a nonsignificant increase in tidal volume, minute ventilation and peak expiratory flow rate values. Mechanical ventilation with heliox allowed the use of significantly lower FiO(2), with a significant decrease in alveolar-arterial oxygen tension difference and a decrease in the oxygenation index which was not statistically significant. There was also a significant increase in the PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio during heliox ventilation. CONCLUSIONS Ventilation with a helium and oxygen mixture had a positive effect on the selected parameters of oxygenation, while its effects on other respiratory parameters were relatively small.","Szczapa, Tomasz; Gadzinowski, Janusz",Neonatology,79,1

METHODS Twenty-eight experienced laparoscopic surgeons (familiar with 30° angled laparoscope, >100 basic laparoscopic procedures, >5 advanced laparoscopic procedures) and 23 novices (no laparoscopy experience) performed the Camera Navigation task in an abstract virtual environment (CN-box) and in a virtual representation of the lower abdomen (CN-abdomen). They also rated the realism and added value of the virtual environments on seven-point scales. RESULTS Within both groups, the CN-box task was accomplished in less time and with shorter tip trajectory than the CN-abdomen task (Wilcoxon test, p < 0.05). No significant differences were found between the performances of the experienced participants and the novices on the CN tasks (Mann-Whitney U test, p > 0.05). In both groups, the CN tasks were perceived as hard work and more challenging than anticipated. CONCLUSIONS Performance of the angled laparoscope navigation task is influenced by the virtual environment surrounding the exercise. The task was performed better in an abstract environment than in a virtual environment with anatomic landmarks. More insight is required into the influence and function of different types of intrinsic and extrinsic feedback on the effectiveness of preclinical simulator training.","Buzink, Sonja N; Christie, Lorna S; Goossens, Richard H M; de Ridder, Huib; Jakimowicz, Jack J",Surgical endoscopy,79,1

However, blind advancement may result in misplacement of left-sided DLTs into the right bronchus. Therefore, incidence, risk factors, and blind repositioning techniques for right bronchial misplacement of left-sided DLTs were investigated. METHODS This was an observational cohort study performed on the data depository consecutively collected from patients who underwent intubation of left-sided DLTs for 2 years. Patients' clinical and anatomical characteristics were analyzed to investigate risk factors for DLT misplacements with logistic regression analysis. Moreover, when DLTs were misplaced into the right bronchus, the bronchial tube was withdrawn into the trachea and blindly readvanced without rotation, or with 90° or 180° counterclockwise rotation while the patient's head was turned right. RESULTS DLTs were inadvertently advanced into the right bronchus in 48 of 1135 (4.2 %) patients. DLT misplacements occurred more frequently in females, in patients of short stature or with narrow trachea and bronchi, and when small-sized DLTs were used. All of these factors were significantly inter-correlated each other (P < 0.001). In 40 of the 48 (83.3 %) patients, blind repositioning was successful. CONCLUSIONS Smaller left-sided DLTs were more frequently misplaced into the right mainstem bronchus than larger DLTs. Moreover, we were usually able to reposition the misplaced DLTs into the left bronchus by using the blind techniques.

It guides perioperative transfusion practice and serves as a key predictor of short-term perioperative risks and long-term oncologic outcomes. Despite its widespread clinical and research use, there is no gold standard for blood loss estimation. We sought to systematically review and compare techniques for intraoperative blood loss estimation in major non-cardiac surgery with the objective of informing clinical estimation and research standards. SOURCE A structured search strategy was applied to Ovid Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases from inception to March 2020, to identify studies comparing methods of intraoperative blood loss in adult patients undergoing major non-cardiac surgery. We summarized agreement between groups of pairwise comparisons as visual estimation vs formula estimation, visual estimation vs other, and formula estimation vs other. For each of these comparisons, we described tendencies for higher or lower EBL values, consistency of findings, pooled mean differences, standard deviations, and confidence intervals. PRINCIPLE FINDINGS We included 26 studies involving 3,297 patients in this review. We found that visual estimation is the most frequently studied technique. In addition, visual techniques tended to provide lower EBL values than formula-based estimation or other techniques, though this effect was not statistically significant in pooled analyses likely due to sample size limitations. When accounting for the contextual mean blood loss, similar case-to-case variation exists for all estimation techniques. CONCLUSIONS We found that significant case-by-case variation exists for all methods of blood loss evaluation and that there is significant disagreement between techniques. Given the importance placed on EBL, particularly for perioperative prognostication models, clinicians should consider the universal adoption of a practical and reproducible method for blood loss evaluation.

Considering the limited training cases and resources (e.g, time and budget), we propose a Multi-task Multi-slice Deep Learning System ( M3Lung-Sys) for multi-class lung pneumonia screening from CT imaging, which only consists of two 2D CNN networks, i.e., slice- and patient-level classification networks. The former aims to seek the feature representations from abundant CT slices instead of limited CT volumes, and for the overall pneumonia screening, the latter one could recover the temporal information by feature refinement and aggregation between different slices. In addition to distinguish COVID-19 from Healthy, H1N1, and CAP cases, our M3Lung-Sys also be able to locate the areas of relevant lesions, without any pixel-level annotation. To further demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, we conduct extensive experiments on a chest CT imaging dataset with a total of 734 patients (251 healthy people, 245 COVID-19 patients, 105 H1N1 patients, and 133 CAP patients). The quantitative results with plenty of metrics indicate the superiority of our proposed model on both slice- and patient-level classification tasks.

The significance of microcirculatory dysfunction in critically ill children and neonates is unknown, but microcirculatory variables can be measured using Doppler or videomicroscopy imaging techniques. We outline the current understanding of the role of the microcirculation in critical illness, review methods for its assessment, and perform a systematic review of how it has been monitored in critically ill neonates and children. DESIGN Systematic review (PROSPERO CRD42019117993). SETTING Not applicable. SUBJECTS Not applicable. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS We systematically searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, and Web of Science. We included studies of critically ill patients 0 to 18 years old investigating microcirculatory blood flow. Two reviewers analyzed abstracts and articles. Results were qualitatively analyzed due to study heterogeneity. A total of 2,559 abstracts met search criteria, of which 94 underwent full-text review. Of those, 36 met inclusion criteria. Seven studies investigated microcirculatory changes in critically ill children. Twenty studies investigated the microcirculatory changes in neonates with variable diagnoses compared with a diverse set of clinical endpoints. Nine studies assessed the effects of age, sex, and birth weight on microvascular flow in neonates. Across all studies, microcirculatory dysfunction was associated with poor outcomes and may not correlate with observed macrovascular function. CONCLUSIONS Assessment of microvascular flow in critically ill children and neonates is possible, although significant challenges remain. In many such patients, microvascular blood flow is disrupted despite medical management targeting normalized macrovascular variables. Future studies are needed to define normal pediatric microvascular flow variables and to assess the impact of patient and treatment factors on its function.","Maitoza, Laura A; Neeman, Eitan; Funaro, Melissa; Pierce, Richard W",Pediatric critical care medicine : a journal of the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the World Federation of Pediatric Intensive and Critical Care Societies,79,1

METHODS AND RESULTS We compared the outcomes of the retrograde versus antegrade-only approach to chronic total occlusion percutaneous coronary intervention among 1301 procedures performed at 11 experienced US centers between 2012 and 2015. The mean age was 65.5±10 years, and 84% of the patients were men with a high prevalence of diabetes mellitus (45%) and previous coronary artery bypass graft surgery (34%). Overall technical and procedural success rates were 90% and 89%, respectively, and in-hospital major adverse cardiovascular events occurred in 31 patients (2.4%). The retrograde approach was used in 539 cases (41%), either as the initial strategy (46%) or after a failed antegrade attempt (54%). When compared with antegrade-only cases, retrograde cases were significantly more complex, both clinically (previous coronary artery bypass graft surgery prevalence, 48% versus 24%; P<0.001) and angiographically (mean Japan-chronic total occlusion score, 3.1±1.0 versus 2.1±1.2; P<0.001) and had lower technical success (85% versus 94%; P<0.001) and higher major adverse cardiovascular events (4.3% versus 1.1%; P<0.001) rates. On multivariable analysis, the presence of suitable collaterals, no smoking, no previous coronary artery bypass graft surgery, and left anterior descending artery target vessel were independently associated with technical success using the retrograde approach. CONCLUSIONS The retrograde approach is commonly used in contemporary chronic total occlusion percutaneous coronary intervention, especially among more challenging lesions and patients. Although associated with lower success and higher major adverse cardiovascular event rates in comparison to antegrade-only crossing, retrograde percutaneous coronary intervention remains critical for achieving overall high success rates.","Karmpaliotis, Dimitri; Karatasakis, Aris; Alaswad, Khaldoon; Jaffer, Farouc A; Yeh, Robert W; Wyman, R Michael; Lombardi, William L; Grantham, J Aaron; Kandzari, David E; Lembo, Nicholas J; Doing, Anthony; Patel, Mitul; Bahadorani, John N; Moses, Jeffrey W; Kirtane, Ajay J; Parikh, Manish; Ali, Ziad A; Kalra, Sanjog; Nguyen-Trong, Phuong-Khanh J; Danek, Barbara A; Karacsonyi, Judit; Rangan, Bavana V; Roesle, Michele K; Thompson, Craig A; Banerjee, Subhash; Brilakis, Emmanouil S",Circulation.

In this study, we prepared a series of lambda-cyhalothrin (LC)-MCs with nano and micron-scale capsule sizes (average diameters of 209.4 nm, MC-N; 2.41 µm, MC-S; 4.87 µm, MC-M; and 12.41 µm, MC-L). The assessment results showed that the release and sedimentation behavior of LC-MCs in water and toxicity to zebrafish at three life stages were all particle size-dependent. As the diameter distribution of approximately 100 nm extended to the micron scale (~27 µm), the capsules released more slowly and sunk more quickly in water. In addition, micron-sized LC-MC exposure resulted in significantly less fish mortality and malformations of larvae and embryos compared with nanosized LC-MC exposure. The highest accumulation of MC-N in the gill and the severest toxicity to larvae suggested that the smaller size and stronger permeability of nanocapsules would pose unpredictable consequences for nontargeted organisms. The obvious toxicological differences of LC-MCs toward aquatic organisms implies that regulating MC production in an appropriate size range is an important prerequisite for achieving efficient but safe pesticide applications.","Huang, Xueping; Wang, Aiping; Luo, Jian; Gao, Yue; Guan, Lei; Zhang, Peng; Liu, Feng; Mu, Wei; Li, Beixing",Journal of hazardous materials,79,1

To survive in the host, FMDV has evolved multiple strategies to antagonize host innate immune responses. In this study, we showed that the leader protease (Lpro) of FMDV, a papain-like proteinase, promoted viral replication by evading the antiviral interferon response through counteracting the 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS)/RNase L system. Specifically, we observed that the titers of Lpro deletion virus were significantly lower than those of wild type FMDV (FMDV-WT) in cultured cells. Our mechanistic studies demonstrated that Lpro interfered with the OAS/RNase L pathway by interacting with N-terminal domain of swine RNase L (sRNase L). Remarkably, Lpro of FMDV exhibited species-specific binding to RNase L in that the interaction was observed only in swine cells, not human, monkey or canine cells. Lastly, we presented evidence that by interacting with sRNase L, FMDV Lpro inhibited cellular apoptosis. Taken together, these results demonstrate a novel mechanism that Lpro utilizes to escape the OAS/RNase L-mediated antiviral defense pathway.IMPORTANCEFMDV is a picornavirus that causes a significant disease in agricultural animals. FMDV has developed diverse strategies to escape the host interferon response. Here we show that Lpro of FMDV antagonizes the OAS/RNase L pathway, an important interferon effector pathway, by interacting with N-terminal domain of sRNase L. Interestingly, such a virus-host interaction is species-specific because the interaction is detected only in swine cells, not in human, monkey, or canine cells. Furthermore, Lpro inhibits apoptosis through interacting with sRNase L. This study demonstrates a novel mechanism by which FMDV has evolved to inhibit host innate immune responses.","Sui, Chao; Jiang, Dandan; Wu, Xiangju; Liu, Sidang; Li, Feng; Pan, Li; Cong, Xiaoyan; Li, Juntong; Yoo, Dongwan; Rock, Daniel L; Miller, Laura C; Lee, Changhee; Du, Yijun; Qi, Jing",Journal of virology,79,11

Although in 2016 the GPEI expected to globally coordinate cessation of the remaining OPV serotypes (1 and 3) by 2021, continuing transmission of serotype 1 wild polioviruses to date makes those plans obsolete.

Furthermore, the in vivo cytokine pattern was compared with that induced in leukocytes stimulated by dead bacteria in vitro. MEFs with culturable pathogenic bacteria contained more interleukin (IL)-1β (median: 110 μg/L vs. <7.5 μg/L), tumour necrosis factor (TNF) (6.3 μg/L vs. <2.5 μg/L), IL-8 (410 μg/L vs. 38 μg/L) and IL-10 (0.48 μg/L vs. <0.30 μg/L) than culture-negative fluids, irrespective of PCR findings. IL-6 and PGE2 were equally abundant (69-110 μg/L) in effusions with live, dead or undetectable bacteria. Cytokine levels were unrelated to bacterial species and to the presence or absence of virus.

While most studies have focused on the former, little is known about the regulation of the negative imprinting of virion particle infectivity by IFITMs and about its relationship with target cell protection. Using a panel of IFITM3 mutants against HIV-1, we have explored these issues as well as others related to the biology of IFITM3, in particular virion packaging, stability, the relation to CD63/multivesicular bodies (MVBs), the modulation of cholesterol levels, and the relationship between negative imprinting of virions and target cell protection. The results that we have obtained exclude a role for cholesterol and indicate that CD63 accumulation does not directly relate to an antiviral behavior. We have defined regions that modulate the two antiviral properties of IFITM3 as well as novel domains that modulate protein stability and that, in so doing, influence the extent of its packaging into virions. The results that we have obtained, however, indicate that, even in the context of an IFITM-susceptible virus, IFITM3 packaging is not sufficient for negative imprinting. Finally, while most mutations concomitantly affect target cell protection and negative imprinting, a region in the C-terminal domain (CTD) exhibits a differential behavior, potentially highlighting the regulatory role that this domain may play in the two antiviral activities of IFITM3.IMPORTANCE IFITM proteins have been associated with the sequestration of incoming virions in endosomes (target cell protection) and with the production of virion particles that incorporate IFITMs and exhibit decreased infectivity (negative imprinting of virion infectivity). How the latter is regulated and whether these two antiviral properties are related remain unknown. By examining the behavior of a large panel of IFITM3 mutants against HIV-1, we determined that IFITM3 mutants are essentially packaged into virions proportionally to their intracellular levels of expression. However, even in the context of an IFITM-susceptible virus, IFITM3 packaging is not sufficient for the antiviral effects. Most mutations were found to concomitantly affect both antiviral properties of IFITM3, but one CTD mutant exhibited a divergent behavior, possibly highlighting a novel regulatory role for this domain. These findings thus advance our comprehension of how this class of broad antiviral restriction factors acts.","Appourchaux, Romain; Delpeuch, Mathilde; Zhong, Li; Burlaud-Gaillard, Julien; Tartour, Kevin; Savidis, George; Brass, Abraham; Etienne, Lucie; Roingeard, Philippe; Cimarelli, Andrea",Journal of virology,79,31

We argue that the media's rhetorical strategies play an important role not only in describing the illness, but in influencing and shaping individual and collective responses to the pandemic, with significant consequences for mental health and well-being in the context of crisis. We align this commentary with the tenets of the sociology of diagnosis, which argue that even though there are material realities of disease, their social form and consequence cannot be separated from the tangible nature of illness and its management. We also lean on Derrida's approach to metaphor, which underlines how even observable viral entities such as COVID-19 are simultaneously material, abstract, and in flux. We describe the metaphors used by local media to describe the pandemic-including combat, bush fires, earthquakes, and other natural disasters-and we explore how and why these metaphors construct the pandemic locally and farther afield.","Lacey, Cherie; Kelly, Michael P; Jutel, Annemarie",Perspectives in biology and medicine,79,13

STUDY DESIGN A cross-sectional survey was distributed electronically through the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine e-mail database (n = 584 distinct practices) and social media between April 14 and 23, 2020. Participants were recruited through ""snowballing."" A single representative was asked to respond on behalf of each L&D unit. Data were analyzed using Chi-square and Fisher's exact tests. Multivariable regression was performed to explore characteristics associated with universal testing and PPE usage. RESULTS A total of 301 surveys (estimated 51.5% response rate) was analyzed representing 48 states and two territories. Obstetrical units included academic (31%), community teaching (45%) and nonteaching hospitals (24%). Sixteen percent of respondents were from states with high prevalence, defined as higher ""deaths per million"" rates compared with the national average. Universal laboratory testing for admissions was reported for 40% (119/297) of units. After adjusting for covariates, universal testing was more common in academic institutions (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.73, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.23-2.42) and high prevalence states (aOR = 2.68, 95% CI: 1.37-5.28). When delivering asymptomatic patients, full PPE (including N95 mask) was recommended for vaginal deliveries in 33% and for cesarean delivery in 38% of responding institutions. N95 mask use during asymptomatic vaginal deliveries remained more likely in high prevalence states (aOR = 2.56, 95% CI: 1.29-5.09) and less likely in hospitals with universal testing (aOR = 0.42, 95% CI: 0.24-0.73). CONCLUSION Universal laboratory testing for COVID-19 is more common at academic institutions and in states with high disease prevalence. Centers with universal testing were less likely to recommend N95 masks for asymptomatic vaginal deliveries, suggesting that viral testing can play a role in guiding efficient PPE use.

DATA AND METHODS Data collected between March 29 and April 3, 2020 from the Canadian Perspectives Survey Series 1: Impacts of COVID-19 (n=4,627) were used to estimate the prevalence of underlying health conditions, health concerns and precautionary behaviours among Canadians aged 15 or older living in the provinces. Multivariate analyses examined associations between these variables after accounting for age, sex and education. RESULTS Close to 1 in 4 Canadians (24%) had an underlying health condition that increased their risk of adverse outcomes from COVID-19. Overall, 36% of the population were very or extremely concerned about the impact of COVID-19 on their own health. Individuals with underlying health conditions had higher odds (odds ratio: 2.0, 95% confidence interval: 1.6 to 2.5) of being highly concerned than those without these conditions, after adjustment for demographic characteristics. High percentages of Canadians took precautions to reduce the risk of infection regardless of whether or not they had underlying health conditions. DISCUSSION Health status was associated with higher levels of concern for one's own health in the early period of the COVID-19 pandemic. Most Canadians were taking precautions recommended by public health authorities to protect themselves and others.","Ramage-Morin, Pamela L; Polsky, Jane Y",Health reports,79,1

Recent studies have found a reduction in incisional hernias when mesh is placed prophylactically during abdominal closure in elective laparotomies. This systematic review will assess the safety and efficacy of prophylactic mesh placement in emergency laparotomy. METHODS A systematic review was performed according to the PROSPERO registered protocol (CRD42018109283). Papers were dual screened for eligibility, and included when a comparison was made between closure with prophylactic mesh and closure with a standard technique, reported using a comparative design (i.e. case-control, cohort or randomised trial), where the primary outcome was incisional hernia. Bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias in non-randomised studies tool. A meta-analysis of incisional hernia rate was performed to estimate risk ratio using a random effects model (Mantel-Haenszel approach). RESULTS 332 studies were screened for eligibility, 29 full texts were reviewed and 2 non-randomised studies were included. Both studies were biased due to confounding factors, as closure technique was based on patient risk factors for incisional hernia. Both studies found significantly fewer incisional hernias in the mesh groups [3.2% vs 28.6% (p < 0.001) and 5.9% vs 33.3% (p = 0.0001)]. A meta-analysis of incisional hernia risk favoured prophylactic mesh closure [risk ratio 0.15 (95% CI 0.6-0.35, p < 0.001)]. Neither study found an association between mesh and infection or enterocutaneous fistula. CONCLUSION This review found that there are limited data to assess the effect or safety profile of prophylactic mesh in the emergency laparotomy setting. The current data cannot reliably assess the use of mesh due to confounding factors, and a randomised controlled trial is required to address this important clinical question.","Burns, F A; Heywood, E G; Challand, C P; Lee, Matthew J",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,79,1

Although remarkable progress in SEs has been achieved and has resulted in high ionic conductivity, which now reaches values comparable to those of liquid electrolytes, the typical use of a slurry process for the fabrication of conventional ASSBs inevitably causes harmful reactions between sulfide materials and polar solvents. Here, we studied the efficient infiltration process of SE slurry into conventional composite LIB electrodes (NCM622) for achieving high-energy-density ASSBs via a scalable solution-based fabrication process. Two methods are proposed to ensure that SE materials are evenly distributed and sufficiently infiltrated into the porous structures of LIB electrodes. The LPSCl SE solutions were effectively infiltrated into the electrodes at higher processing temperatures and the temperature was subsequently optimized at above the boiling point of the ethanol solvent due to the dynamic motion of SE molecules via a convective flow during solvent vaporization. Moreover, the porous LIB composite electrodes with a mixture of active materials of different particle sizes formed and filled capillary pores resulting in a high electrode density. The LPSCl SE-infiltrated NCM622 electrodes that used this strategy could remarkably improve the initial discharge capacity of ASSBs to as high as 177 mAh/g. These ASSBs also showed excellent performance even at high loading values (about 17 mg/cm2), making them competitive with LIBs using conventional liquid electrolytes.","Kim, Min-Ju; Park, Jun-Woo; Kim, Byung Gon; Lee, You-Jin; Ha, Yoon-Cheol; Lee, Sang-Min; Baeg, Kang-Jun",Scientific reports,79,1

Leishmaniasis is transmitted from one human to other through the bite of sandflies. It is endemic in around 98 countries including tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, Southern America, and the Mediterranean region. Sterol C-24 methyltransferase (LdSMT) of Leishmania donovani (L. donovani) mediates the transfer of CH3-group from S-adenosyl methionine to C-24 position of sterol side chain which makes the ergosterol different from cholesterol. Absence of ortholog in human made it potential druggable target. Here, we performed virtual screening of library of natural compounds against LdSMT to identify the potential inhibitor for it and to fight leishmaniasis. Gigantol, flavan-3-ol, and parthenolide showed the best binding affinity towards LdSMT. Further, based on absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion properties and biological activity prediction, gigantol showed the best lead-likeness and drug-likeness properties. Therefore, we further elucidated its antileishmanial properties. We found that gigantol inhibited the growth and proliferation of promastigotes as well as intra-macrophagic amastigotes. Gigantol exerted its antileishmanial action through the induction of reactive oxygen species in dose-dependent manner. Our study, suggested the possible use of gigantol as antileishmanial drug after further validations to overcome leishmaniasis.","Rahman, Fazlur; Tabrez, Shams; Ali, Rahat; Akand, Sajjadul Kadir; Zahid, Mariya; Alaidarous, Mohammed A; Alsaweed, Mohammed; Alshehri, Bader Mohammed; Banawas, Saeed; Bin Dukhyil, Abdul Aziz; Rub, Abdur",Journal of cellular biochemistry,79,1

OBJECTIVE Our aim was to evaluate whether nutritional deficiency (ND) is an important determinant of survival following surgery for RCC. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A total of 369 consecutive patients underwent surgery for locoregional RCC from 2003 to 2008. ND was defined as meeting one of the following criteria: body mass index <18.5 kg/m(2), albumin <3.5 g/dl, or preoperative weight loss ≥ 5% of body weight. INTERVENTION All patients underwent radical or partial nephrectomy. MEASUREMENTS Primary outcomes were overall and disease-specific mortality. Covariates included age, Charlson comorbidity index (CCI), preoperative anemia, tumor stage, Fuhrman grade, and lymph node status. Multivariate analysis was performed using a Cox proportional hazards model. Mortality rates were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier product-limit method. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS Eighty-five patients (23%) were categorized as ND. Three-year overall and disease-specific survival were 58.5% and 80.4% in the ND cohort compared with 85.4% and 94.7% in controls, respectively (p<0.001). ND remained a significant predictor of overall mortality (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.41, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.40-4.18) and disease-specific mortality (HR: 2.76; 95% CI, 1.17-6.50) after correcting for age, CCI, preoperative anemia, stage, grade, and nodal status. This study is limited by its retrospective nature. CONCLUSIONS ND is associated with higher mortality in patients undergoing surgery for locoregional RCC, independent of key clinical and pathologic factors. Given this mortality risk, it may be important to address nutritional status preoperatively and counsel patients appropriately.","Morgan, Todd M; Tang, Dominic; Stratton, Kelly L; Barocas, Daniel A; Anderson, Christopher B; Gregg, Justin R; Chang, Sam S; Cookson, Michael S; Herrell, S Duke; Smith, Joseph A; Clark, Peter E",European urology,79,17

The consensus concludes that, given the prevalence of comorbidities associated with Down syndrome, the higher incidence of cases with severe COVID-19 in this population group and a higher mortality, individuals with trisomy 21 should be considered as a high-risk population, and therefore, vaccina tion against SARS-CoV-2 should have a high priority for all people with Down syndrome regardless of their age (except for the age limit established by the clinical trials of each vaccine), and should be preceded only by the groups of health personnel and adults aged > 60-65 years. Likewise, this group of experts urges health authorities to include people with intellectual disabilities and related conditions as a priority population (other chromosomal abnormalities other than Down syndrome, intellectual disability, congenital anomalies and conditions that cause disability with microcephaly), as well as the caregivers of people with this type of conditions. Vaccination in children with this type of disorders should be considered as part of the first priority group, once safe vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are available for use in children and adolescents.","Faundes, Victor; Pardo, Rosa; Cammarata-Scalisi, Francisco; Alarcon, Pablo; Lay-Son, Guillermo; San Martin, Esteban",Andes pediatrica : revista Chilena de pediatria,79,1

STUDY DESIGN Retrospective case series. ANIMALS Foals (n = 65). METHODS Medical records (2010-2015) of foals up to 1 month of age, surgically treated for an umbilical infection were reviewed. Short-term (at the time of discharge from hospital) and long-term (1 year after surgery) survival rates were obtained. Clinical variables influencing survival were assessed. Chi-square or Fisher's exact test were used to evaluate the relationship between the data retrieved and outcome. P ≤ .05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS Sixty-five foals were included in the study, representing 17.2% of all foals admitted to the hospital. Fifty foals were discharged from hospital (77%) and 43 foals (66%) were alive 1 year after surgery. Lower long-term survival rates were associated with: younger age at presentation, septic joints, multiple pathologies, higher creatinine level, higher heart rate, umbilical infection diagnosed at the hospital rather than prior to referral, prolonged hospitalization, longer period between arrival and surgery, and postoperative complications. The most common surgical findings were urachal enlargement followed by right arterial enlargement. CONCLUSION Younger foals with worse systemic condition and concurrent disorders are at higher risk for treatment failure. Early diagnosis improves the outcome. Surgical treatment yields good results and should be considered upon diagnosis, after taking into account the clinical situation.

From these measurements, a variety of derived indices can be determined, such as volume, compliance, resistance, and work of breathing. Plateau pressure is a measure of end-inspiratory distending pressure. It has become increasingly appreciated that end-inspiratory transpulmonary pressure (stress) might be a better indicator of the potential for lung injury than plateau pressure alone. This has resulted in a resurgence of interest in the use of esophageal manometry in mechanically ventilated patients. End-expiratory transpulmonary pressure might also be useful to guide the setting of PEEP to counterbalance the collapsing effects of the chest wall. The shape of the pressure-time curve might also be useful to guide the setting of PEEP (stress index). This has focused interest in the roles of stress and strain to assess the potential for lung injury during mechanical ventilation.

We report a feasibility study that adapted the Program for Education and Enrichment of Relational Skills (PEERS) to provide an intensive 8 week online delivery to female adolescents, blended with some face-to-face group meetings. A systematic multiple-case series design with case tracking was developed, comprising a 3-month baseline, a 2-month intervention and a 3-month follow-up period. Seven adolescents with Turner Syndrome and social communication difficulties (17-20 years) took part, together with their parents. Acceptability and feasibility were assessed by means of qualitative feedback and attendance rates. Changes in social adaptation were tracked using measures of social knowledge, social behaviour and autistic symptoms, plus anxiety and self-esteem. Attendance rates were consistently high and there were no dropouts. Qualitative feedback indicated the online format was acceptable to both the participants and their families. Objective outcome measures showed significant gains in social knowledge and improved social initiations from measures made during the pre-intervention baseline. This proof-of-principle pilot study demonstrated blended social skills interventions are both feasible and acceptable to adolescent females with social communication difficulties. LAY SUMMARY: Social skills groups are increasingly popular for children with social communication disorders, but there is little evidence for their use online. Psychological treatments that require weekly face-to-face sessions for both children and their parents are associated with practical difficulties, disrupting family life and school commitments. Our study, is the first to use a blended online and face-to-face social skills training program for adolescent girls with social communication difficulties. We showed that this new approach to treatment was acceptable to families and has a positive and significant impact on participant's social performance and social knowledge. This new treatment approach may increase the accessibility of treatment for adolescents and young adults, especially those with social communication difficulties.","Wolstencroft, Jeanne; Kerry, Eleanor; Denyer, Hayley; Watkins, Alice; Mandy, William; Skuse, David",Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research,79,1

For HPSR evidence to inform and strengthen health systems, it needs to flow efficiently between evidence producers, evidence synthesisers, evidence processers and disseminators and evidence implementors in an evidence ecosystem. A substantial body of evidence for health systems strengthening is generated in SA, and this informs national and international health system guidelines and guidance. In this manuscript, in celebration of the 50th anniversary of the SA Medical Research Council, we apply an evidence ecosystem lens to the SA health system, and discuss its current functioning in support of the achievement of a high-quality health system that is able to achieve universal health coverage. We use three case studies to describe successes, challenges and gaps in the functioning of the evidence ecosystem. The first case study focuses on using evidence to strengthen health-system governance and support for community health worker programmes. The second case focuses on managing the growing epidemic of drug-resistant tuberculosis, while the third case focuses on social protection, the child support grant and its impact on health. SA scientists are part of global initiatives to strengthen the health-systems evidence ecosystem, specifically through pioneering methods to synthesise evidence and produce evidence-informed guidelines to facilitate evidence use in health-system decision-making.

The NCATS' National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C) is a centralized data resource representing the largest multicenter cohort of COVID-19 cases and controls nationwide. We aimed to construct and characterize the cancer cohort within N3C and identify risk factors for all-cause mortality from COVID-19. METHODS We used 4,382,085 patients from 50 US medical centers to construct a cohort of patients with cancer. We restricted analyses to adults ≥ 18 years old with a COVID-19-positive or COVID-19-negative diagnosis between January 1, 2020, and March 25, 2021. We followed N3C selection of an index encounter per patient for analyses. All analyses were performed in the N3C Data Enclave Palantir platform. RESULTS A total of 398,579 adult patients with cancer were identified from the N3C cohort; 63,413 (15.9%) were COVID-19-positive. Most common represented cancers were skin (13.8%), breast (13.7%), prostate (10.6%), hematologic (10.5%), and GI cancers (10%). COVID-19 positivity was significantly associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.15 to 1.24). Among COVID-19-positive patients, age ≥ 65 years, male gender, Southern or Western US residence, an adjusted Charlson Comorbidity Index score ≥ 4, hematologic malignancy, multitumor sites, and recent cytotoxic therapy were associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality. Patients who received recent immunotherapies or targeted therapies did not have higher risk of overall mortality. CONCLUSION Using N3C, we assembled the largest nationally representative cohort of patients with cancer and COVID-19 to date. We identified demographic and clinical factors associated with increased all-cause mortality in patients with cancer. Full characterization of the cohort will provide further insights into the effects of COVID-19 on cancer outcomes and the ability to continue specific cancer treatments.","Sharafeldin, Noha; Bates, Benjamin; Song, Qianqian; Madhira, Vithal; Yan, Yao; Dong, Sharlene; Lee, Eileen; Kuhrt, Nathaniel; Shao, Yu Raymond; Liu, Feifan; Bergquist, Timothy; Guinney, Justin; Su, Jing; Topaloglu, Umit",Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,79,19

In search of a tool to spread dermatologic knowledge during confinement, an online medical meeting was held on April 25th to 26th, 2020. In this study, we aimed to assess the characteristics, opinion and satisfaction of the attendees to a free-of-charge online congress. Secondarily, we intended to explain how this meeting was prepared. METHODS Online survey administered to the attendees to an online congress organised via the Telegram® Messenger App. Its organisation and planning, which needed no financial support and was done by volunteer organisers, moderators and speakers, is described step by step. RESULTS The satisfaction of both speakers and attendees was very high. All participants considered that this format had a great present and future, and most of them rated it as superior to regular face-to-face meetings. Female gender and predominantly private practice favoured this opinion. DISCUSSION The COVID-19 pandemic has forced the cancellation of most scientific gatherings. This has been seen by some authors as an excellent opportunity, encouraging medical societies and organisations to lead the change to virtual meetings. Although confinement did not allow real contact, our online meeting showed it was possible to ensure interaction and participation between attendees, moderators and speakers. Dermatologists enjoyed some dermatologic science, even despite the extraordinary circumstances disrupting their daily clinical practice. Most of them felt they were participating in something new and compelling that many felt superior to traditional meetings.","Martin-Gorgojo, A; Bernabeu-Wittel, J; Linares-Barrios, M; Russo-De la Torre, F; Garcia-Doval, I; Del Rio-De la Torre, E",Actas dermo-sifiliograficas,79,11

BACKGROUND Short- and medium-term data appear to support the effectiveness of LSG, but long-term data to support its durability are sparse. METHODS A prospective database was reviewed on all high-risk patients who underwent LSG as part of a staged approach for surgical treatment of severe obesity between January 2002 and February 2004. We included only patients who did not proceed to second-stage surgery (gastric bypass). Analyzed data included demographics, BMI, comorbidities, and surgical outcomes. All partial gastrectomies were performed using a 50F bougie. RESULTS Seventy-four patients underwent LSG, and follow-up data were available on 69 of 74 patients (93%). The mean age was 50 years (25-78) and the mean number of co-morbidities was 9.6. Perioperative mortality (<30 days) was zero, and the incidence of short- and long-term postoperative complications was 15%. The mean overall follow-up time period was 73 months (38-95). Mean excess weight loss (EWL) at 72, 84, and 96 months after LSG was 52%, 43%, and 46%, respectively, with an overall EWL of 48%. The mean BMI decreased from 66 kg/m(2) (43-90) to 46 kg/m(2) (22-73). Seventy-seven percent of the diabetic patients showed improvement or remission of the disease. CONCLUSIONS This study reports the longest follow-up of LSG patients thus far and supports the effectiveness, safety, and durability of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy as a definitive therapeutic option for severe obesity, even in high-risk, high-BMI patients.","Eid, George M; Brethauer, Stacy; Mattar, Samer G; Titchner, Rebecca L; Gourash, William; Schauer, Philip R",Annals of surgery,79,1

Our study aimed to evaluate the relationship between 25 hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) level, the most representative metabolite of VitD status, and polymorphism of the cytochrome P450, CYP27B1 gene, which influence vitamin D metabolism, and serum levels, in SLE Tunisian patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS A cross-sectional study has been conducted in SLE patients (supplemented and not supplemented patients), matched to healthy controls by age and gender. The 25[OH]D serum level was measured by chemiluminescence assay and CYP27B1-1260 genetic polymorphism was carried out using PCR-RFLP methods. Statistical analysis was made using Shesis and SPSS.20 Software. RESULTS Controls and Vit D not supplemented patients' groups presented the highest percentage of hypovitaminosis D. A significant difference in the mean level of circulating 25[OH]D between Vit D supplemented SLE patients and controls was observed (23.91 ng/ml and 7.18 ng/ml, respectively p = 3.4 105 ). Our results showed a correlation of high 25[OH]D level with complement component 3 levels and prednisolone drug. Moreover, the analysis of CYP27B1-1260 polymorphism in SLE patients and controls revealed a nonsignificant allelic or genotypic association. CONCLUSION Despite the sunny climate, the high prevalence of Vit D deficiency is common in Tunisia. This hypovitaminosis D feature may affect the Vit D levels in our SLE patients but a direct association with the disease or with the genetically determined features remains unclear. More studies are needed to establish thresholds and susceptibility genes according to the characteristics of each population.","Fakhfakh, Raouia; Feki, Sawsan; Elleuch, Aida; Neifar, Manel; Marzouk, Sameh; Elloumi, Nesrine; Hachicha, Hend; Abida, Olfa; Bahloul, Zouhir; Ayadi, Fatma; Masmoudi, Hatem",Molecular genetics & genomic medicine,79,14

Here we present the cryo-electron microscopic structure of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp in active form, mimicking the replicating enzyme. The structure comprises the viral proteins nsp12, nsp8, and nsp7, and over two turns of RNA template-product duplex. The active site cleft of nsp12 binds the first turn of RNA and mediates RdRp activity with conserved residues. Two copies of nsp8 bind to opposite sides of the cleft and position the second turn of RNA. Long helical extensions in nsp8 protrude along exiting RNA, forming positively charged 'sliding poles'. These sliding poles can account for the known processivity of the RdRp that is required for replicating the long coronavirus genome3. Our results enable a detailed analysis of the inhibitory mechanisms that underlie the antiviral activity of substances such as remdesivir, a drug for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)4.","Hillen, Hauke S; Kokic, Goran; Farnung, Lucas; Dienemann, Christian; Tegunov, Dimitry; Cramer, Patrick",Nature,79,20

OBJECTIVE To evaluate the safety and efficacy of the DED for emergency treatment of ruptured intracranial aneurysms. METHODS Between February 2016 and March 2018, 10 patients (median age 54.5 years, seven women) with 11 aneurysms were treated with the DED at three neurovascular centers. Procedural details, complications, morbidity, and aneurysm occlusion (O'Kelly-Marotta scale, OKM) were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS Among 11 aneurysms treated, there were nine anterior circulation and two posterior circulation aneurysms. Aneurysm morphology was saccular in four cases, dissecting in three, blister-like in three, and fusiform in one. In each case, a single DED was implanted and deployment was technically successful without exception. Adjunctive coiling was performed in two aneurysms. We observed one in-stent thrombosis, presumably due to low response to clopidogrel 4 days after the procedure, which remained with a mild hemiparesis after aspiration thrombectomy. No further thromboembolic or hemorrhagic events occurred. Favorable outcome (modified Rankin scale score ≤2) at last follow-up was achieved in all patients. Among 10 aneurysms available for angiographic follow-up, complete aneurysm occlusion (OKM D) was obtained in nine cases (90.0%). CONCLUSIONS In this pilot study, endovascular treatment of ruptured intracranial aneurysms with the DED was feasible and not associated with any incidence of rebleeding. Larger series with longer follow-up are warranted to reach a definite conclusion about this device.","Goertz, Lukas; Dorn, Franziska; Kraus, Bastian; Borggrefe, Jan; Schlamann, Marc; Forbrig, Robert; Turowski, Bernd; Kabbasch, Christoph",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,79,31

The aim of our study was to analyze the adherence of children to long-term home CPAP/NIV treatment. METHODS We analyzed data from all consecutive patients older than the age of 2years, in whom CPAP/NIV treatment was initiated in a specialized pediatric NIV and in those who were receiving CPAP/NIV treatment at home for at least 1month. Data of the memory cards of the ventilators and nocturnal gas exchange were analyzed during a routine CPAP/NIV overnight control in the hospital. CPAP/NIV adherence during the previous month was analyzed according to patient's age, ventilatory mode, type of interface, nocturnal gas exchange, and duration of treatment. RESULTS The data of 62 children (mean age, 10±5years) with obstructive sleep apnea (n=51) treated with CPAP and neuromuscular disease (n=6) or lung diseases (n=5) treated with NIV were analyzed. Mean adherence was 8:17±2:30h:min per night, and the results did not significantly differ between CPAP and NIV adherence. Seventy-two percent of the patients used their device >8h per night. The mean number of nights of CPAP/NIV use during the last month was 26±5 nights per month. Treatment adherence was not correlated to age, the type of underlying disease, the type of interface (nasal, facial mask, or nasal cannula), nocturnal gas exchange, and duration of CPAP/NIV treatment. CONCLUSION Long-term CPAP/NIV adherence at home was extremely high in this group of children followed in a pediatric NIV unit. This finding may explain the lack of effect of the interface, nocturnal gas exchange, and duration of CPAP/NIV treatment.","Ramirez, Adriana; Khirani, Sonia; Aloui, Sabrina; Delord, Vincent; Borel, Jean-Christian; Pépin, Jean-Louis; Fauroux, Brigitte",Sleep medicine,79,7

Wounding and fungal inoculation with Endoconidiophora polonica of spruce bark were carried out, and phloem tissues were frequently collected to follow the temporal and spatial progress of chemical and structural responses. The changes in (+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin, stilbene glucoside, and resin acid distribution, and accumulation patterns within the phloem, were mapped using time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (cryo-ToF-SIMS), alongside detailed structural (LM, TEM, SEM) and quantitative chemical microanalyses of the tissues. Our results show that axial phloem parenchyma cells of Norway spruce contain (+)-catechins, the amount of which locally increases in response to fungal inoculation. The preformed, constitutive distribution and accumulation patterns of (+)-catechins closely follow those of stilbene glucosides. Phloem phenolics are not translocated but form a layered defense barrier with oleoresin compounds in response to pathogen attack. Our results suggest that axial phloem parenchyma cells are the primary location for (+)-catechin storage and synthesis in Norway spruce phloem. Chemical mapping of bark defensive metabolites by cryo-ToF-SIMS, in addition to structural and chemical microanalyses of the defense reactions, can provide novel information on the local amplitudes and localizations of chemical and structural defense mechanisms and pathogen-host interactions of trees.","Jyske, Tuula; Kuroda, Katsushi; Keriö, Susanna; Pranovich, Andrey; Linnakoski, Riikka; Hayashi, Noriko; Aoki, Dan; Fukushima, Kazuhiko",Molecules,79,17

Understanding the relation between in utero DES exposure and depression will provide insight to the potential adverse effects of bisphenol A, a functionally similar and ubiquitous endocrine disruptor. The association between in utero DES exposure and depression was assessed among participants in the Nurses' Health Study II who first reported their history of antidepressant use in 1993 and lifetime history of depressive symptoms in 2001. DES exposure was reported by 1,612 (2.2%) women. A history of depression at baseline was higher among women exposed to DES in utero compared with those not exposed (age-adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 1.47, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.26, 1.72) (P < 0.001). Incident depression (first use of antidepressants among women who also reported depressive symptoms) during follow-up (1995-2005) was reported by 19.7% of women exposed to DES and 15.9% unexposed (age-adjusted OR = 1.41, 95% CI: 1.22, 1.63) (P < 0.001). Adjustment for risk factors of depression and correlates of DES exposure moderately attenuated the association (multivariable-adjusted OR = 1.30, 95% CI: 1.13, 1.51) (P = 0.0004).

Temperature readings are taken periodically to detect febrile episodes and consequently implement the appropriate medical countermeasures. However, fever is often difficult to assess at early stages, or remains undetected until the next reading, probably a few hours later. The objective of this article is to develop a statistical model to forecast fever before a temperature threshold is exceeded to improve the therapeutic approach to the subjects involved. To this end, temperature series of 9 patients admitted to a general internal medicine ward were obtained with a continuous monitoring Holter device, collecting measurements of peripheral and core temperature once per minute. These series were used to develop different statistical models that could quantify the probability of having a fever spike in the following 60 minutes. A validation series was collected to assess the accuracy of the models. Finally, the results were compared with the analysis of some series by experienced clinicians. Two different models were developed: a logistic regression model and a linear discrimination analysis model. Both of them exhibited a fever peak forecasting accuracy greater than 84%. When compared with experts' assessment, both models identified 35 (97.2%) of 36 fever spikes. The models proposed are highly accurate in forecasting the appearance of fever spikes within a short period in patients with suspected or confirmed febrile-related illnesses.","Jordan, Jorge; Miro-Martinez, Pau; Vargas, Borja; Varela-Entrecanales, Manuel; Cuesta-Frau, David",Journal of critical care,79,1

METHODS The MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL databases were searched for papers published in English from 1 January 1975 to 31 March 2020. Early SSC was defined as when the infant was placed directly onto the mother's chest within 180 minutes of birth. Two authors independently searched the databases, appraised study quality and extracted the study design and outcome data. The primary outcomes were the infants' physiological stability after birth: thermoregulation and stabilisation. The secondary outcomes were exclusive breastfeeding and mother-infant interaction. RESULTS We reviewed 30 studies that assessed the benefits of early SSC: 22 comprised term-born healthy infants and eight focused on preterm or ill infants. These included various gestational ages, birth methods and cultural backgrounds. The studies demonstrated that early SSC stabilised neonatal physiological parameters, promoted exclusive breastfeeding and supported bonding. Most of the data were from term and late preterm births. CONCLUSION This systematic review showed that early SSC could be beneficial. Further studies that focus on providing very and extremely preterm infants with SSC, and parental experiences, are needed to enable SSC to be adopted as routine practice.","Gupta, Nidhi; Deierl, Aniko; Hills, Emily; Banerjee, Jayanta",Acta paediatrica,79,7

However, there is limited evidence on the routine application of the same-day ""test and treat"" recommendation in low-income settings. This study assessed the effect of same-day treatment initiation on individual-level retention at 6- and 12-months follow-up. METHODS A multicenter facility-based retrospective cohort study was conducted to compare retention-in-care between PLHIV who started antiretroviral therapy (ART) on the same-day and those started ART > 7 days following HIV diagnoses. Participants were at least 15 years-old and were newly diagnosed and started on ART between October 2016 and July 2018 in 11 health facilities in the Amhara region of Ethiopia. Multivariable logistic regression controlling for potential confounders and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis were used to assess differences in outcomes between the groups. RESULTS In total, 433 PLHIV started ART on the same-day of diagnosis and 555 PLHIV who started ART > 7 days after HIV diagnosis were included in the study. At 6-months, 82.0% (355) in the same-day group vs 89.4% (496) in the > 7 days group were retained-in-care (absolute risk difference (RD) = 7.4%; 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.9-11.8%). At 12-months, 75.8% (328) in the same-day group vs 82.0% (455) in the > 7 days group were retained-in-care (absolute RD = 6.2%; 95% CI: 1.1, 11.4%). The major drop in retention was in the first 30 days following ART initiation among same-day group. After adjusting for baseline and non-baseline covariates, the same-day group was less likely to be retained-in-care at 6- and 12-months (adjusted risk ratio (RR) = 0.89; 95% CI: 0.87, 0.90 and adjusted RR = 0.86; 95% CI: 0.83, 0.89, respectively). CONCLUSIONS Reduced retention-in-care can threaten the benefit of the same-day ""test and treat"" policy. The policy needs to be implemented cautiously with greater emphasis on assessment and preparation of PLHIV for ART to ensure treatment readiness before starting them on same-day ART and close monitoring of patients during early follow-up periods.","Ahmed, Ismael; Demissie, Meaza; Worku, Alemayehu; Gugsa, Salem; Berhane, Yemane",BMC public health,79,31

To date, clinical application is still in an early phase and limitations remain. Here, we evaluated the impact of viral mNGS for cases analyzed over two years in a tertiary diagnostics unit. High throughput mNGS was performed upon request by the treating clinician in cases where the etiology of infection remained unknown or the initial differential diagnosis was very broad. The results were compared to conventional routine testing regarding outcome and workload. In total, 163 specimens from 105 patients were sequenced.

In parallel, conventional virus diagnostic tests were performed (mean 18.5 individually probed targets/patients). mNGS detected viruses in 34 cases (32%). While often confirmatory, in multiple cases, the identified viruses were not included in the selected routine diagnostic tests. Two years of mNGS in a tertiary diagnostics unit demonstrated the advantages of a single, untargeted approach for comprehensive, rapid and efficient virus diagnostics, confirming the utility of mNGS in complementing current routine tests.","Kufner, Verena; Plate, Andreas; Schmutz, Stefan; Braun, Dominique L; Günthard, Huldrych F; Capaul, Riccarda; Zbinden, Andrea; Mueller, Nicolas J; Trkola, Alexandra; Huber, Michael",Genes,79,12

This has important implications for the risk of patient-to-staff, staff-to-staff and staff-to-patient transmission among health professionals in maternity units. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of previously undiagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infection in health professionals from two tertiary-level maternity units in London, UK, and to determine associations between healthcare workers' characteristics, reported symptoms and serological evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. In total, 200 anaesthetists, midwives and obstetricians, with no previously confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, were tested for immune seroconversion using laboratory IgG assays. Comprehensive symptom and medical histories were also collected. Five out of 40 (12.5%; 95%CI 4.2-26.8%) anaesthetists, 7/52 (13.5%; 95%CI 5.6-25.8%) obstetricians and 17/108 (15.7%; 95%CI 9.5-24.0%) midwives were seropositive, with an overall total of 29/200 (14.5%; 95%CI 9.9-20.1%) of maternity healthcare workers testing positive for IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Of those who had seroconverted, 10/29 (35.5%) were completely asymptomatic. Fever or cough were only present in 6/29 (21%) and 10/29 (35%) respectively. Anosmia was the most common symptom occurring in 15/29 (52%) seropositive participants and was the only symptom that was predictive of positive seroconversion (OR 18; 95%CI 6-55). Of those who were seropositive, 59% had not self-isolated at any point and continued to provide patient care in the hospital setting. This is the largest study of baseline immune seroconversion in maternity healthcare workers conducted to date and reveals that one out of six were seropositive, of whom one out of three were asymptomatic. This has significant implications for the risk of occupational transmission of SARS-CoV-2 for both staff and patients in maternity units. Regular testing of staff, including asymptomatic staff should be considered to reduce transmission risk.","Bampoe, S; Lucas, D N; Neall, G; Sceales, P; Aggarwal, R; Caulfield, K; Siassakos, D; Odor, P M",Anaesthesia,79,16

A DNA vaccine encoding hemagglutinin (HA) protein from the A/Indonesia/5/05 (H5N1) strain was initially tested in two randomized phase I clinical studies. Vaccine Research Center study 304 (VRC 304) was a double-blinded study with 45 subjects randomized to placebo, 1 mg of vaccine, or 4 mg of vaccine treatment groups (n = 15/group) by intramuscular (i.m.)

Antibody responses to H5 were assessed by hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assay, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and neutralization assay, and the H5 T cell responses were assessed by enzyme-linked immunospot and intracellular cytokine staining assays. There were no vaccine-related serious adverse events, and the vaccine was well tolerated in all groups. At 1 mg, i.d. vaccination compared to i.m. vaccination induced a greater frequency and magnitude of response by ELISA, but there were no significant differences in the frequency or magnitude of response between the i.d. and i.m. routes in the HAI or neutralization assays. T cell responses were more common in subjects who received the 1- or 4-mg dose i.m. These studies demonstrated that the DNA vaccine encoding H5 is safe and immunogenic and served to define the proper dose and route for further studies. The i.d. injection route did not offer a significant advantage over the i.m. route, and no difference was detected by delivery to one site versus splitting the dose between two sites for i.d. vaccine administration.

The 5' half of the gRNA encodes two proteins involved in replication, the p27 and its readthrough product, p86 (the viral RNA dependent-RNA polymerase, RdRp), and the 3' half encodes two small movement proteins, p7 and p12, and the coat protein (CP). As other members of the family Tombusviridae, carmoviruses express ORFs that are not 5'-proximal from subgenomic RNAs (sgRNAs). Analysis of double-stranded RNAs extracted from PFBV-infected leaves and Northern blot hybridizations of total RNA from infected plants or protoplasts revealed than PFBV produces four 3'-coterminal sgRNAs of 3.2, 2.9, 1.7 and 1.4kb, respectively. The 5' termini of the 1.7 and 1.4kb sgRNAs mapped 26 and 143 nt upstream of the initiation codons of the p7 and CP genes, respectively, whereas the 5'-ends of the 3.2 and 2.9kb sgRNAs were located within the readthrough portion of the RdRp gene. The PFBV sgRNAs begin with a motif which is also present at the 5' terminus of the gRNA and the minus polarity of the regions preceding their corresponding start sites (in the gRNA) may be folded into hairpin structures resembling those found for the sgRNA promoters of other carmoviruses. The results indicate that, besides the sgRNAs involved in the translation of the movement proteins and the CP identified in most carmoviral infections, PFBV produces two additional sgRNAs whose biological significance is currently unknown. The possible participation of the 3.2 and 2.9kb PFBV sgRNAs in the expression of readthrough portions of the RdRp is discussed.","Rico, P; Hernández, C",Virus research,79,8

The shift in stage has been met with a shift in treatment modality because the preservation of renal parenchyma can prevent adverse outcomes. Robot-assisted laparoscopic partial nephrectomy (RALPN) needs significant surgeon expertise, and preoperative planning is imperative. PATIENTS AND METHODS Between December 2010 and September 2011, virtual surgical planning (VSP) was used in consecutive patients with renal tumors that were suspicious for renal-cell carcinoma who were undergoing RALPN by a single surgeon. Three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions were examined and manipulated preoperatively, and an operative plan formulated. Intraoperative anatomy and preoperative 3D reconstructions were compared in real time. RESULTS A total of 10 patients underwent RALPN with preoperative VSP. Average patient age at intervention was 54.6 years and average tumor size was 4.3 cm (range 1.7-7.5 cm). Tumor laterality was evenly distributed. Nephrometry score ranged from 5A to 10P, and final tumor pathology results revealed malignancy in 80%. No complications occurred intraoperatively, and an excellent correlation was noted between preoperative 3D reconstruction and intraoperative anatomy. All patients underwent a successful partial nephrectomy with no positive margins on final pathology results. Mean length of surgery was 232.9 minutes (range 156-435 min), and mean estimated blood loss was 370 mL (range 75-1800 mL). Warm ischemia time ranged from 20 to 50 minutes (mean 33.9 min). Data regarding postoperative renal function were available for six patients with an average loss of function of 9.5% (range 2%-17%). CONCLUSIONS The implementation of this novel technology has significantly improved our ability to plan RALPN preoperatively. Tumor depth and complexity of tumor resection are assessed and the appropriate operative intervention and approach planned. Tumor proximity to vascular structures and collecting system were reliably predicted and therefore anticipated. Overall, these advantages created a safer surgical endeavor.","Lasser, Michael S; Doscher, Matthew; Keehn, Aryeh; Chernyak, Victoria; Garfein, Evan; Ghavamian, Reza",Journal of endourology,79,1

Although laparoscopic techniques for liver resection are gaining acceptance worldwide, few studies have investigated NOTES liver resection. We used a porcine model to assess the feasibility and safety of transvaginal NOTES liver resection (TV NOTES LR). MATERIALS AND METHODS Nine female pigs underwent TV NOTES LR. A nonsurvival acute porcine model with general anesthesia was used in all cases. Using hybrid NOTES technique, we placed only 1 umbilical 12-mm umbilical trocar in the abdominal wall, which was used to create pneumoperitoneum. A laparoscope was then advanced to obtain intra-abdominal visualization. A 15-mm vaginal trocar was inserted under direct laparoscopic vision, and a flexible endoscope was introduced through the vaginal trocar. A long, flexible grasper and endocavity retractor were used to stably retract the liver. The liver edge was partially transected using energy devices inserted through the umbilical trocar. To transect the left lateral lobe, a flexible linear stapler was inserted alongside the vaginal trocar. A specimen extraction bag was deployed and extracted transvaginally. Blood loss, bile leakage, operative time, and specimen size were evaluated. Necropsy studies were performed after the procedures. RESULTS Eighteen transvaginal NOTES partial liver resections and 4 transvaginal NOTES left lateral lobectomies were successfully performed on 9 pigs. Mean operative time was 165.8 minutes, and mean estimated blood loss was 76.6 mL. All TV NOTES LRs were performed without complications or deaths. Necropsy showed no bile leakage from remnant liver. CONCLUSIONS Our porcine model suggests that TV NOTES LR is technically feasible and safe and has the potential for clinical use as a minimally invasive alternative to conventional laparoscopic liver resection.","Katagiri, Toshio; Otsuka, Yuichiro; Horgan, Santiago; Sandler, Bryan J; Jacobsen, Garth R; Coker, Alisa M; Tsuchiya, Masaru; Maeda, Tetsuya; Kaneko, Hironori","Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy & percutaneous techniques",79,28

However, the crucial immunological role of the spleen in combating bacterial infections, in particular pneumonias, has led to a search for splenic-preserving techniques whenever possible. Yet, laparoscopic partial splenectomies are still rarely described possibly due to difficulties in controlling intra-operative parenchymal bleeding during splenic transection. METHODS Here, we present a case series of laparoscopic partial splenectomies using a new technique. The main splenic artery and vein were temporarily clamped using a detachable clip. Transection of the spleen was possible working with the LigaSure™ instrument. After transection, the margin was sealed with a collagen fleece. In one case of a haemangioma, the patient underwent a radiological coil embolisation of the feeding arteries of the splenic pole in question. This was done 4 weeks prior to surgery and included embolisation of the tumour. RESULTS Three patients (2 males, 1 female, mean age 58.3 years) have been successfully treated using a detachable clamp. The pre-surgical mean size of the spleen was 8.0 × 16.7 cm (range 6 × 14-11 × 22 cm). The removed specimens had a mean size of 4.2 × 5.5 cm (range 2.5 × 4.0-5.0 × 6.5 cm). The time of surgery averaged 144 min (range 110-187 min). Blood loss was minimal thereby avoiding the need for blood transfusions. The post-surgical course was uneventful; patients were discharged 5 days following surgery. Histopathology showed a benign splenic haemangioma, a benign splenic hamartoma and the presence of Hodgkin's disease stage III. CONCLUSIONS The technique of laparoscopic partial splenectomy and, in certain patients, pre-surgical partial splenic embolisation is safe and effective for patients with localised diseases of the spleen. This approach combines the benefits of the minimal surgical access with saving a significant amount of splenic tissue, thereby preserving the immune function of the spleen.","Patrzyk, Maciej; Glitsch, Anne; Hoene, Andreas; von Bernstorff, Wolfram; Heidecke, Claus Dieter",Langenbeck's archives of surgery,79,12

After screening for inclusion/exclusion criteria, data were extracted from the articles by two co-authors. Articles included in the search were using wearable or mobile technology to estimate or evaluate sleep, published in English and conducted in adult populations. Our search returned 3897 articles and 43 met our inclusion criteria.

Few studies were used to identify sleep disorders (n = 2), evaluate response to interventions (n = 3) or deliver interventions (n = 5). In conclusion, the use of consumer-targeted wearable and mobile sleep monitoring technology has largely focused on validation of devices and applications compared with polysomnography (PSG) but opportunities exist for observational research and for delivery of behavioral interventions. Multidisciplinary research is needed to determine the uses of these technologies in interventions as well as the use in more diverse populations including sleep disorders and other patient populations.","Baron, Kelly Glazer; Duffecy, Jennifer; Berendsen, Mark A; Cheung Mason, Ivy; Lattie, Emily G; Manalo, Natalie C",Sleep medicine reviews,79,1

Compared to male survivors, female survivors reported greater use of problem-focused coping and also perceived their abuse experience, particularly the use of force, as having a more negative impact on them. Stronger attachment to mother and to friends predicted more positive problem-focused coping. Mattering to friends moderated the relation between CSA history and problem-focused coping, with the CSA survivors who reported the highest mattering to friends also using the most problem-focused coping strategies.

The molecular dynamics and enhanced molecular dynamics simulations were used for a thorough analysis of the mammalian TPC1 behaviour in the presence and absence of the ligand molecule, with a special accent on the supposed bottleneck, the hydrophobic gate. Moreover, from the reconstructed free energy obtained from enhanced simulations, we have calculated the macroscopic conductance of sodium ions through the mTPC1, which we compared with measured single-channel conductance values. The hydrophobic gate works as a steric barrier and the key parameters are its flexibility and the dimension of the sodium first hydration shell.","Milenkovic, Stefan; Bodrenko, Igor V; Lagostena, Laura; Gradogna, Antonella; Serra, Giovanni; Bosin, Andrea; Carpaneto, Armando; Ceccarelli, Matteo",Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,79,16

However, little is known regarding the mechanisms by which white adipose tissue (WAT) is lost acutely and then restored after the resolution of sepsis. Therefore, the signaling pathways governing protein synthesis, autophagy, apoptosis, and the ubiquitin-proteasome were investigated to identify potential mechanisms mediating the acute (24 h) loss of WAT after cecal ligation and puncture as well as the failure to replenish WAT during recovery (day 10). While whole body fat mass was decreased equally in pair-fed control and septic mice at 5 days after cecal ligation and puncture, fat mass remained 35% lower in septic mice at day 10 During sepsis-recovery, protein synthesis in epididymal WAT was increased compared with control values, and this increase was associated with an elevation in eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF)2Bε but no change in mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 activity (eIF4E-binding protein-1 or S6 kinase 1 phosphorylation). Protein breakdown was increased during sepsis-recovery, as evidenced by the elevation in ubiquitin-proteasome activity. Moreover, indexes of autophagy (light chain 3B-II, autophagy-related protein 5/12, and beclin) were increased during sepsis-recovery and associated with increased AMP-activated kinase-dependent Ser555-phosphorylated Unc-51-like autophagy activating kinase-1. Apoptosis was increased, as suggested by the increased cleavage of caspase-3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. These changes were associated with increased inflammasome activity (increased NLR family, pyrin domain containing 3; TMS1; and caspase-1 cleavage) and the endoplasmic reticulum stress response (increased eIF2α and activating transcription factor-4) and browning (uncoupling protein-1) in epididymal WAT. Our data suggest that WAT stores remain depleted during recovery from sepsis due to sustained inflammation and elevations in protein and cellular degradation, despite the increase in protein synthesis.","Crowell, Kristen T; Soybel, David I; Lang, Charles H","American journal of physiology.

However, the surgical alternatives might carry out significant complications, impaired quality of life, and higher costs than nonoperative treatment. Consequently, it is necessary to evaluate the different therapeutic alternatives' cost-effectiveness in patients diagnosed with uncomplicated appendicitis. METHODS We performed a model-based cost-effectiveness analysis comparing nonoperative management (NOM) with open appendectomy (OA) and laparoscopic appendectomy (LA) in patients otherwise healthy adults aged 18-60 years with a diagnosis of uncomplicated AA from the payer´s perspective at the secondary and tertiary health care level. The time horizon was 5 years. A discount rate of 5% was applied to both costs and outcomes. The health outcomes were quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Costs were identified, quantified, and valorized from a payer perspective; therefore, only direct health costs were included. An incremental analysis was estimated to determine the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). In addition, the net monetary benefit (NMB) was calculated for each alternative using a willingness to pay lower than one gross domestic product.

An incremental analysis was estimated to determine the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). In addition, the net monetary benefit (NMB) was calculated for each alternative using a willingness to pay lower than one gross domestic product. A deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed. RESULTS LA presents a lower cost ($363 ± 35) than OA ($384 ± 41) and NOM ($392 ± 44). NOM exhibited higher QALYs (3.3332 ± 0.0276) in contrast with LA (3.3310 ± 0.057) and OA (3.3261 ± 0.0707). LA dominated the OA. The ICER between LA and NOM was $24,000/QALY. LA has a 52% probability of generating the highest NMB versus its counterparts, followed by NOM (30%) and OA (18%). There is a probability of 0.69 that laparoscopy generates more significant benefit than medical management. The mean value of that incremental NMB would be $93.7 per patient. CONCLUSIONS LA is a cost-effectiveness alternative in the management of patients with uncomplicated AA. Besides, LA has a high probability of producing more significant monetary benefits than NOM and OA from the payer's perspective in the Colombian health system.","Guevara-Cuellar, César Augusto; Rengifo-Mosquera, María Paula; Parody-Rúa, Elizabeth",Cost effectiveness and resource allocation : C/E,79,33

Despite all efforts to contain the spread of the disease, the number of infections and deaths continue to rise, particularly in some regions. Given its presence in the salivary secretions of affected patients, and the presence of many reported asymptomatic cases that have tested positive for COVID-19, dental professionals, including Endodontists, are at high risk of becoming infected if they do not take appropriate precautions. As of today, there are no predictable treatments or approved vaccines that can protect the public and health care professionals from the virus; however, there is speculation that a vaccine might be available sometime in 2021. Until then, general dentists and Endodontist will need to be able to treat emergency patients in order to relieve pressure on emergency clinics in hospitals or local community hubs. In addition, as the pandemic continues, strategies to manage patients will need to evolve from a palliative to a more permanent/definitive treatment approach. In this article, an update on the treatment considerations for dental care in general is provided, as well as a discussion on the available endodontic guidelines reported in the literature.

Although the technique for revascularization differs significantly for these two lesions (simple thrombectomy for thromboemboli and balloon angioplasty and stenting for ICAD), the underlying etiology is often unknown in acute ischemic stroke (AIS). OBJECTIVE To evaluate whether procedural complications, revascularization rates, and functional outcomes differ among patients with LVO from ICAD or thromboembolism. METHODS A retrospective review of thrombectomy cases from 2008 to 2015 was carried out for cases of AIS due to underlying ICAD. Thirty-six patients were identified. A chart and imaging review was performed to determine revascularization rates, periprocedural complications, and functional outcomes. Patients with ICAD and acute LVO were compared with those with underlying thromboemboli. RESULTS Among patients with ICAD and LVO, mean National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score on admission was 12.9±8.5, revascularization (Thrombolysis In Cerebral Infarction, TICI ≥2b) was achieved in 22/34 (64.7%) patients, 11% had postprocedural intracerebral hemorrhage (PH2), and 14/33 (42.4%) had achieved a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 0-2 at the 3-month follow-up. Compared with patients without underlying ICAD, there was no difference in NIHSS on presentation, or in the postprocedural complication rate. However, procedure times for ICAD were longer (98.5±59.8 vs 37.1±34.2 min), there was significant difference in successful revascularization rate between the groups (p=0.001), and a trend towards difference in functional outcome at 3 months (p=0.07). CONCLUSIONS Despite AIS with underlying ICAD requiring a more complex, technically demanding recanalization strategy than traditional thromboembolic AIS, it appears safe, and good outcomes are obtainable.","Al Kasab, Sami; Almadidy, Zayed; Spiotta, Alejandro M; Turk, Aquilla S; Chaudry, M Imran; Hungerford, John P; Turner, Raymond D",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,79,16

METHODS From October 1992 to August 2010, 40 patients with a median age of 68 years underwent laparoscopic anterior hemifundoplication surgery for upside-down stomach and were included in our prospective study. The median symptoms duration was 5 years. The leading clinical symptoms were postprandial, epigastric, or retrosternal pain (80%), heartburn (78%), regurgitation (80%), dysphagia (53%), and anemia (48%). Preoperative evaluation included blood test, chest X-ray, upper endoscopy, and barium swallow. In some patients an esophageal 24-h pH study and esophageal manometry were performed. The median follow-up was 46 months using a standardized questionnaire, including Smiley score, modified Visick score, gastrointestinal quality-of-life index (GQLI), and specific reflux symptoms score. RESULTS Surgery was finished laparoscopically in 39 patients (97%). One patient had to be converted to an open procedure because of severe adhesions. Mesh hiatoplasty had to be performed in one patient due to a large hiatal defect. Median operative time was 160 min (range=90-275) and median blood loss was 5 ml (range=0-300). Seven patients (18%) presented with acute symptoms. Intraoperative technical complications occurred in four patients (10%) and nontechnical complications in two cases (5%). Median postoperative hospital stay was 5 days (range=2-17). Postoperative complications occurred in two patients (5%): one pleural effusion and one surgical emphysema. There was no mortality or symptomatic recurrence. All scores showed significant improvement and patient satisfaction. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic treatment of type 4 hiatal hernia is safe. With respect to the quality of life, anterior hemifundoplication is highly effective.","Obeidat, Firas W; Lang, Reinhold A; Knauf, Andreas; Thomas, Michael N; Hüttl, Tanija K; Zügel, Nico P; Jauch, Karl-Walter; Hüttl, Thomas P",Surgical endoscopy,79,16

The incidence of COVID-19, the disease associated with this new coronavirus, continues to rise. The epidemic threatens to overwhelm healthcare systems, and identifying those regions where the disease burden is likely to be high relative to the rest of the country is critical for enabling prudent and effective distribution of emergency medical care and public health resources. Globally, the risk of severe outcomes associated with COVID-19 has consistently been observed to increase with age2,3. We used age-specific mortality patterns in tandem with demographic data to map projections of the cumulative case burden of COVID-19 and the subsequent burden on healthcare resources. The analysis was performed at the county level across the United States, assuming a scenario in which 20% of the population of each county acquires infection. We identified counties that will probably be consistently, heavily affected relative to the rest of the country across a range of assumptions about transmission patterns, such as the basic reproductive rate, contact patterns and the efficacy of quarantine. We observed a general pattern that per capita disease burden and relative healthcare system demand may be highest away from major population centers. These findings highlight the importance of ensuring equitable and adequate allocation of medical care and public health resources to communities outside of major urban areas.","Miller, Ian F; Becker, Alexander D; Grenfell, Bryan T; Metcalf, C Jessica E",Nature medicine,79,12

Mares were presented with unilateral ovarian enlargement during the 2007 to 2010 breeding seasons. The mean (sd) age of the mares was 11.7 (5.96) years. Three mares were multiparous barren, three were nulliparous and one was primigravida. Behaviour at presentation was 57 per cent anoestrus, 28 per cent with stallion-like behaviour and 14 per cent with persistent oestrus. All mares had unilateral ovarian enlargement. Six non-pregnant mares had a small and inactive contralateral ovary; the pregnant mare had a single small corpus luteum on the contralateral ovary and was at three-and-a-half months' gestation. Enlarged ovaries measured 7 cm to an estimated 30 cm in diameter. 28 per cent had a multicystic ultrasound appearance, 57 per cent were dense structures and 14 per cent were of mixed appearance. Mean concentrations of progesterone were <1 ng/ml, oestrone sulphate 3.06 (2.32) ng/ml and testosterone 0.58 (0.64) nmol/l in non-pregnant mares. Inhibin was elevated in all non-pregnant cases at 7.6 (12.45) ng/ml. The pregnant mare had concentrations of progesterone 2.5 ng/ml, oestrone sulphate 81.0 ng/ml, testosterone 1.9 nmol/l and inhibin 1.31 ng/ml.

This method is deduced theoretically from existing formulae and equations. The main advantage of this method is that data measured not only under near neutral conditions, but also under unstable and slightly stable conditions can be used to calculate the scaling parameters. Based on the data measured above an Acacia Saligna agroforestry system, the displacement height (d0) calculated by the TCLI method and by a conventional method are compared. Under strict neutral conditions, the two methods give almost the same results. Under unstable conditions, d0 values calculated by the conventional method are systematically lower than those calculated by the TCLI method, with the latter exhibiting only slightly lower values than those seen under strictly neutral conditions. Computation of the average values of the scaling parameters for the agroforestry system showed that the displacement height and roughness length for momentum are 68% and 9.4% of the average height of the tree canopy, respectively, which are similar to percentages found in the literature. The calculated roughness length for sensible heat is 6.4% of the average height of the tree canopy, a little higher than the percentages documented in the literature. When wind direction was aligned within 5 degrees of the row direction of the trees, the average displacement height calculated was about 0.6 m lower than when the wind blew across the row direction. This difference was statistically significant at the 0.0005 probability level. This implies that when the wind blows parallel to the row direction, the logarithmic profile of wind speed is shifted lower to the ground, so that, at a given height, the wind speeds are faster than when the wind blows perpendicular to the row direction.","Zhao, Wenguang; Qualls, Russell J; Berliner, Pedro R",International journal of biometeorology,79,1

DESIGN Longitudinal study over a 3- to 6-year period. SETTING Urban and rural area in Japan. PARTICIPANTS Independently living Japanese adults aged 69-71 years and 79-81 years at baseline. This analysis excluded participants who were defined as underweight at baseline. MEASUREMENTS Information was collected on age, gender, occlusal force, the number of teeth, BMI, socioeconomic factors, medical history, the number of daily prescription medications, cognitive function, depressive symptoms, hand grip strength, and physical function. Maximal occlusal force was measured with a pressure-sensitive sheet. Nutritional status was assessed using BMI, and participants with BMI <21.5 were defined as underweight. Then, they were divided into two groups: a ""BMI declined"" group who were defined as underweight at either 3- or 6-year follow-up survey, and a ""BMI maintained"" group who were not defined as underweight at both follow-up surveys. Logistic generalized estimating equation (GEE) models were used to assess the effect of occlusal force and the number of teeth at baseline on decline in BMI over 3 or 6 years, after adjusting for possible covariates associated with nutritional status. RESULTS The final analysis included 704 participants. Eighty-six (12.2%) participants were classified into the BMI declined group. Logistic GEE models showed that the number of teeth was not significantly associated with decline in BMI. However, occlusal force was significantly associated with decline in BMI (odds ratio = 0.90, 95% confidence interval = 0.83-0.97) after adjusting for covariates. CONCLUSION Participants with lower occlusal force were more likely to be in the BMI less than 21.5 kg/m2 . The findings suggest that to prevent decline in oral function is important to maintain nutritional status.","Fukutake, Motoyoshi; Takahashi, Toshihito; Gondo, Yasuyuki; Kamide, Kei; Masui, Yukie; Matsuda, Ken-Ichi; Enoki, Kaori; Takeshita, Hajime; Mihara, Yusuke; Hatta, Kodai; Sato, Hitomi; Murotani, Yuki; Hagino, Hiromasa; Kabayama, Mai; Ishizaki, Tatsuro; Sugimoto, Ken; Rakugi, Hiromi; Maeda, Yoshinobu; Moynihan, Paula; Ikebe, Kazunori",Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,79,8

Emergence of COVID-19 put added pressure on caregivers. AIMS The aim of this study was to investigate the psychological health of Iranian caregivers of children with CP and associated risks during a lockdown period. METHODS Using online snowball sampling, 160 caregivers of children with CP participated in this web-based cross-sectional study. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-4), Caregiver Difficulties Scale (CDS), and a demographic questionnaire were administered. Hierarchical multiple linear regression analysis was applied to identify risk factors related to caregiver psychological health. OUTCOMES AND RESULTS Mental health problems were prevalent; (depression = 45.0% and anxiety = 40.6%). Significant correlations were found between CDS and HADS-Anxiety (r = 0.472, P < 0.001), HADS-depression (r = 0.513, P < 0.001), and perceived stress (PSS) related to COVID-19 (r = 0.425, P < 0.001). After controlling for demographic and clinical variables, burden (CDS) was found to significantly predict caregiver anxiety, depression and stress. Furthermore, several demographic characteristics (being married, low educational level and low income) were significantly related to high HADS Anxiety scores. For depression, only having a physical problem was significantly related to HADS among demographic variables. No significant correlations were found between PSS-4 and demographic variables. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS During COVID-19 outbreak, the mental health of caregivers of children with CP is affected by multiple factors such as burden of care and demographic characteristics. Due to the importance of well-being among caregivers of disabled children, a comprehensive plan including psychological consultation, remote education, or in-person handouts for the self-care or handling of the children and adequate distance support may enable better mental health for these caregivers.","Farajzadeh, Ata; Dehghanizadeh, Moslem; Maroufizadeh, Saman; Amini, Malek; Shamili, Aryan",Research in developmental disabilities,79,27

OBJECTIVE To report our anatomic angiographic results at first (3-6 months) and second (18 ± 3 months) angiographic follow-up in a series of 15 patients. METHODS Fifteen patients (15 aneurysms) were consecutively treated in our center by 2 operators for a large-neck bifurcation aneurysm between March 2012 and February 2014. Results were evaluated by assessing WEB cage position at the aneurysm neck on angiography and high-resolution contrast-enhanced flat-panel detector computed tomography, contrast medium stagnation within the WEB and aneurysm on intraprocedural angiography, and 1-day time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography. All aneurysms were followed up by angiography. Results at follow-up were graded as complete occlusion, neck remnant, or residual aneurysm. The 2 operators compared postprocedural and follow-up images and classified them as better, same, or worse. Subtracted images were compared in different projections to assess any WEB device compression or shape changes. RESULTS A worsening was observed between the postprocedural and first follow-up angiography in 10 of 14 (71.5%) and in 4 of 7 (57.2%) between the first and second control angiography.

To optimize the surgical procedure a method for meticulous preoperative three-dimensional computed tomography (3D-CT) planning was developed and analysed. The aim of this study was to evaluate how 3D-CT influenced the choice of access route and treatment outcome. MATERIAL AND METHODS Patients planned for PCNL were included in a prospective study. Decision algorithms were studied and recorded before and after 3D-CT planning in a total of 35 patients. RESULTS Thirty-one of the patients (88%) had a complex stone situation. The CT examinations resulted in change of access plan in 15 out of 28 patients, in addition to seven patients where access could not be planned without 3D-CT, totalling 22 out of 35 (63%). This resulted in 24 patients (69%) being stone free after a single PCNL session. Of these 24 patients, 22 (22/35 = 63%) were stone free with one dilated access track only. In 16 of the 24 patients (76%) who were stone free after one PCNL procedure, evaluation of the 3D-CT images had changed the initial preoperative planning (10 cases) or made planning possible (six cases). A few patients had thoracic complications but there were no cases with bleeding. CONCLUSIONS Preoperative planning of complex stone situations with 3D-CT had a significant impact on operative procedure, resulting in a low number of access punctures.","Brehmer, Marianne; Beckman, Mats O; Magnusson, Anders",Scandinavian journal of urology,79,24

OBJECTIVE To quantify sex differences in self-reported total energy intake (TEI) compared with a reference measure of total energy expenditure (TEE). METHODS Six electronic databases were systematically searched for published original research articles between 1980 and April 2020. Studies were included if they were conducted in adult populations with measures for both females and males of self-reported TEI and TEE from doubly labeled water (DLW). Studies were screened and quality assessed independently by 2 authors. Random-effects meta-analyses were conducted to pool the mean differences between TEI and TEE for, and between, females and males, by method of dietary assessment. RESULTS From 1313 identified studies, 31 met the inclusion criteria. The studies collectively included information on 4518 individuals (54% females). Dietary assessment methods included 24-h recalls (n = 12, 2 with supplemental photos of food items consumed), estimated food records (EFRs; n = 11), FFQs (n = 10), weighed food records (WFRs, n = 5), and diet histories (n = 2). Meta-analyses identified underestimation of TEI by females and males, ranging from -1318 kJ/d (95% CI: -1967, -669) for FFQ to -2650 kJ/d (95% CI: -3492, -1807) for 24-h recalls for females, and from -1764 kJ/d (95% CI: -2285, -1242) for FFQ to -3438 kJ/d (95% CI: -5382, -1494) for WFR for males. There was no difference in the level of underestimation by sex, except when using EFR, for which males underestimated energy intake more than females (by 590 kJ/d, 95% CI: 35, 1,146). CONCLUSION Substantial underestimation of TEI across a range of dietary assessment methods was identified, similar by sex. These underestimations should be considered when assessing TEI and interpreting diet-disease relations.","McKenzie, Briar L; Coyle, Daisy H; Santos, Joseph Alvin; Burrows, Tracy; Rosewarne, Emalie; Peters, Sanne A E; Carcel, Cheryl; Jaacks, Lindsay M; Norton, Robyn; Collins, Clare E; Woodward, Mark; Webster, Jacqui",The American journal of clinical nutrition,79,1

This Spitzer warm mission program mapped the plane of the outer Milky Way with IRAC at 3.6 and 4.5 μm. We combine the IRAC, Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), and Two Micron All Sky Survey catalogs and our previous results from another outer Galaxy survey and identify a total of 47,338 young stellar objects (YSOs) across the field spanning >180° in Galactic longitude. Using the DBSCAN method on the combined catalog, we identify 618 clusters or aggregations of YSOs having five or more members. We identify 10,476 class I, 29,604 class II, and 7325 anemic class II/class III YSOs. The ratio of YSOs identified as members of clusters was 25,528/47,338, or 54%. We found that 100 of the clusters identified have previously measured distances in the WISE H II survey. We used these distances in our spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting of the YSOs in these clusters, of which 96 had YSOs with <3σ fits. We used the derived masses from the SED model fits to estimate the initial mass function (IMF) in the inner and outer Galaxy clusters; dividing the clusters by galactocentric distances, the slopes were Γ = 1.87 ± 0.31 above 3 M ⵙ for R Gal < 11.5 kpc and Γ = 1.15 ± 0.24 above 3 M ⵙ for R Gal > 11.5 kpc. The slope of the combined IMF was found to be Γ = 1.92 ± 0.42 above 3 M ⵙ. These values are consistent with each other within the uncertainties and with literature values in the inner Galaxy high-mass star formation regions. The slopes are likely also consistent with a universal Salpeter IMF.","Winston, Elaine; Hora, Joseph L; Tolls, Volker",The Astronomical journal,79,1

The authors assessed the effectiveness of these NINDS-initiated programs to increase the number of independent NIH-funded neurosurgeon-scientists and grow NIH neurosurgery research funding. METHODS NIH funding data for faculty and clinical department funding were derived from the NIH, academic departments, and Blue Ridge Institute of Medical Research databases from 2006 to 2019. RESULTS Between 2009 and 2019, the NINDS R25 funded 87 neurosurgical residents. Fifty-three (61%) have completed the award and training, and 39 (74%) are in academic practice. Compared to neurosurgeons who did not receive R25 funding, R25 awardees were twice as successful (64% vs 31%) in obtaining K-series awards and received the K-series award in a significantly shorter period of time after training (25.2 ± 10.1 months vs 53.9 ± 23.0 months; p < 0.004). Between 2013 and 2019, the NINDS K12 has supported 19 neurosurgeons. Thirteen (68%) have finished their K12 support and all (100%) have applied for federal funding. Eleven (85%) have obtained major individual NIH grant support. Since the establishment of these two programs, the number of unique neurosurgeons supported by either individual (R01 or DP-series) or collaborative (U- or P-series) NIH grants increased from 36 to 82 (a 2.3-fold increase). Overall, NIH funding to clinical neurological surgery departments between 2006 and 2019 increased from $66.9 million to $157.3 million (a 2.2-fold increase). CONCLUSIONS Targeted research education and career development programs initiated by the NINDS led to a rapid and dramatic increase in the number of NIH-funded neurosurgeon-scientists and total NIH neurosurgery department funding.","Lonser, Russell R; Smith, Luke G F; Tennekoon, Michael; Rezai-Zadeh, Kavon P; Ojemann, Jeffrey G; Korn, Stephen J",Journal of neurosurgery,79,1

STUDY DESIGN Ex vivo biomechanical study. STUDY POPULATION Four variations of unidirectional knotless suture and 1 canine cadaver. METHODS Welded end loop on strands consisted of 0 Quill polydioxanone (QP; n = 22), 0 Quill monoderm (QM; n = 23), 2-0 V-Loc 90 (V9; n = 12), and 2-0 V-Loc 180 (V18; n = 12). Half of the suture strands in each group were passed percutaneously through an insufflated cadaveric body wall, and the remaining half served as intact controls. A linear testing machine was used to load the sutures to failure. Modes of and loads to failure were compared within and between suture types. RESULTS Loads to failure did not differ between sutures passed through the body wall and their controls when the loop remained intact. Sutures V9, V18, and QM sustained higher loads to failure compared with QP. All Quill suture lines failed at the weld during testing. Thirty-three percent of QP sutures failed at the weld during initial passage through the body wall. V-Loc sutures failed at the suture-apparatus interface, within the welded loop, or a combination. CONCLUSION Passing suture through a cadaveric body wall did not affect the integrity of the welded end loop of any of the unidirectional knotless sutures tested here when the loop remained intact. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Unidirectional knotless suture (V9, V18 and QM) can be safely passed through a canine body wall for use in laparoscopic procedures. The use of QP in this manner cannot be recommended.","Bailey, Kristin L; Johnson, Matthew; Travers, Colin J; Fox-Alvarez, W Alexander",Veterinary surgery : VS,79,27

The main objectives of this study were to i) investigate the temporal variations of ambient PM2.5 in Marseille (Southern France), where air pollution is again a major public health issue, and ii) estimate their short-term health effects and annual trend (Mann-Kendall test) over a 10-year period from 2010 to 2019. In Marseille, the main sources of PM2.5 could be related to road traffic, industrial complexes, and oil refineries surrounded the city. The number of premature deaths and hospital admissions attributable to ambient PM2.5 exposure for non-accidental causes, cardiovascular and respiratory diseases were estimated by using in-situ air quality data, city-specific relative risk values and baseline incidence. Despite significant reduction of PM2.5 (- 0.80 μg m-3 year-1), Marseille citizens were exposed to PM2.5 levels exceeding the World Health Organization (WHO) Air Quality Guideline for human health protection (10 μg m-3) during entire study period. Exposure to ambient PM2.5 substantially contributed to mortality and hospital admissions: 871 deaths for non-accidental causes, 515 deaths for cardiovascular diseases, 47 deaths for respiratory diseases, as well as 1034 hospital admissions for cardiovascular diseases and 834 for respiratory diseases were reported between 2010 and 2019. Compliance with WHO annual limit values can result in substantial socio-economic benefits by preventing premature deaths and hospital admissions. For instance, based on the value of a statistical life and average cost of a hospital admission, the associated benefit for healthcare would have been €131 million in 2019. Between 2010 and 2019, the number of PM2.5-related non-accidental deaths decreased by 1.15 per 105 inhabitants annually. Compared to 2010-2019, the restrictive measures associated to COVID-19 pandemic led to a reduction in PM2.5 of 11% in Marseille, with 2.6 PM2.5-related deaths averted in 2020.","Khaniabadi, Yusef Omidi; Sicard, Pierre",Chemosphere,79,16

There is a great deal of interest in substance use (SU) prevention programmes for young people that work to change representations of these products and help with mobilisation of life skills. Unfortunately, few existing programmes are evidence-based.In France, a programme called Expériences Animées (EA, Animated Experiences) has been developed, inspired by life skills development programmes that have been proven to be successful. The EA programme uses animated short movies and talks with high school and secondary school pupils about the use of psychoactive substances and addictions. By allowing life skills mobilisation and modifying representations and beliefs about SU, it is aimed at delaying initiation of use of psychoactive substances, preventing adolescents from becoming regular consumers, reducing the risks and harms related to the use of these substances and opening the way for adapted support measures.We are interested in understanding how, under what circumstances, through which mechanisms and among which adolescents the EA programme works. Therefore, we have developed the ERIEAS study ('Evaluation Réaliste de l'Intervention Expériences Animées en milieu Scolaire'; Realist Evaluation of the EA Intervention in Schools). METHODS AND ANALYSIS EA will be conducted in 10 schools. A multi-case approach will be adopted with the aim of developing and adjusting an intervention theory. The study comes under the theory-driven evaluation framework. The investigation methodology will include four stages: (i) elaboration of a middle-range theory; (ii) data collection for validating/adjusting the theory; (iii) data analysis; and (iv) refinement and adjustment of the middle-range theory and definition of the programme's key functions. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION The study will provide evidence-based results to health authorities to help in the rollout of health promotion strategies in schools. It will provide knowledge about the strategic configurations most suitable for leading to life skills mobilisation and change young people's representations about SU. The project will be carried out with full respect of current relevant legislation (eg, the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union) and international conventions (eg, Helsinki Declaration). It follows the relevant French legislation of the research category on interventional research protocol involving the human person. The protocol was approved by the Comité et Protection des Personnes (CPP), that is, Committee for the Protection of Persons CPP SUD-EST VI n°: AU 1525 and was reported to the Agence Française de Sécurité Sanitaire des Produits de Santé (ANSM) that is, the French National Agency for the Safety of Health Products.

A comprehensive review of literature on ESG regulatory frameworks for sample developed and developing country was performed leading to undertaking of a cross-country comparative ESG analysis. It was revealed that a country's social and governance disclosure were driven by either voluntary or by mandatory codes that could not be a standalone factor for uplifting the country's overall ESG level. Other governance measures like sustainability reporting and integrated reporting practices need to be considered in order to uplift the ESG practice. Country-level environmental commitment was vital for both developed and emerging markets for solving information asymmetry issues and establishment of resilient business operations and reporting practices, leading to an emerging sustainable practice which needs to be adopted. Our findings offer valuable insights for regulators, institutional investors and policymakers in terms of considering ESG practices adopted by developed countries and bridging the gap from unsustainability to sustainability in countries with least developed emerging ESG countries. The study encourages the regulators to devise disclosure policies as per the Triple ‘C’ framework namely policies that are convenient, credible and comparable with the flexibility to encompass black swan events like Covid-19. The purpose of such disclosures should be to resolve the information asymmetry problem which primarily exists when regulations are non-mandatory. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Singhania, M.; Saini, N.",Journal of Sustainable Finance and Investment,79,25

This work presents a new approach for bots' detection on Twitter, combining the use of feature selection, clustering, and classification algorithms. The proposed approach was compared with more conventional ones (for example, without the use of clustering) and the premise used in this work proved to be true: the use of clustering, together with the features selection, allowed the production of better classification models in order to identify not only the bots who have an activity profile considered non-human (extremely active on Twitter) but also other bots whose profiles are more similar to humans' ones. The best results of automatic detection of bots reached an overall accuracy of 96.8% and F1 score equal to 0.622.

Within engineering, however, economic and environmental aspects of sustainability are often prioritized over social ones. This paper describes how efficiency and sustainability were conceptualized and interrelated by students in a newly developed second-year undergraduate engineering course, An Integrated Approach to Energy. This course took a sociotechnical approach and emphasized modern energy concepts (e.g., renewable energy), current issues (e.g., climate change), and local and personal contexts (e.g., connecting to students’ lived experiences). Analyses of student work and semi-structured interview data were used to explore how students conceptualized sustainability and efficiency. We found that in this cohort (n = 17) students often approached sustainability through a lens of efficiency, believing that if economic and environmental resources were prioritized and optimized, sustainability would be achieved. By exploring sustainability and efficiency together, we examined how dominant discourses that privilege technical over social aspects in engineering can be replicated within an energy context.","Gelles, Laura A.; Mejia, Joel Alejandro Lord Susan M.; Hoople, Gordon D.; Chen, Diana A.",Sustainability,79,1

The lockdown caused by the COVID-19 outbreak has become a natural laboratory, enabling to investigate the impact of human/industrial activities on the air pollution. In this study, we investigated the spatio-temporal density of TROPOMI-based nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) products, and MODIS-derived Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) from January 2019 to September 2020 (also covering the first wave of the COVID-19) over Turkey using Google Earth Engine (GEE). The results showed a significant decrease in NO2 and AOD, while SO2 unchanged and had slightly higher concentrations in some regions during the lockdown compared to 2019. The relationship between air pollutants and meteorological parameters during the lockdown showed that air temperature and pressure were highly correlated with air pollutants, unlike precipitation and wind speed. Moreover, Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) data, indicator of economic/industrial activities, also provided poor correlation with air pollutants. TROPOMI-based NO2 and SO2 were compared with station-based pollutants for three sites (suburban, urban, and urban-traffic classes) in Istanbul, revealing 0.83, 0.70 and 0.65 correlation coefficients for NO2, respectively, while SO2 showed no significant correlation. Besides, AOD data were validated using two AERONET sites providing 0.86 and 0.82 correlation coefficients. Overall, the satellite-based data provided significant outcomes for the spatio-temporal evaluation of air quality, especially during the first wave of the COVID-19 lockdown.","Ghasempour, Fatemeh Sekertekin Aliihsan Kutoglu Senol Hakan",Journal of Cleaner Production,79,1

Data on the impact of COVID-19 on youth with T1D is scarce. We sought to determine the impact on youth with T1D and their families including the extent to which they experienced COVID-related disruptions and distress. Methods: The COVID-19 Exposure and Family Impact Survey (CEFIS) was administered to caregivers of youth with T1D at two comprehensive diabetes clinics in the northeast and southern U.S. Items were scored and analyzed using SPSS. Themes were coded for open-ended questions. Health data were extracted from EMR. Results: Mothers (85%) of 47 youth (72%NHW, 24%NHB, 4%H) with T1D (HbA1c M=8.3%) ranging from 6 to 17 years participated. Insulin pumps were used by 66% and CGMs by 17%. The most frequent COVID-related challenges endorsed were school/childcare closure (95.1%), education disruption (87.2%) and inability to visit/care for family (74.5%). Fewer caregivers reported difficulty accessing food (11.3%), necessary health care (9.4%), or medicine (5.7%). Areas of negative impact included child's access to medical supplies (2.6), physical activity level and diet (M=2.7), as well as caregiver anxiety (M =3.2), mood (M =2.8), sleeping, eating, and exercise (M=2.7). Caregivers reported COVID-related distress for themselves (M=5.8) and their child (M=5.0;scale 1-10). Common themes regarding the impact of COVID-19 were increased health anxiety, limited social interaction, and routine disruption. Caregivers noted benefits in family cohesion. Both positive and negative impact on diabetes management were described by caregivers. Quotes from caregivers will be presented. Conclusions: This ongoing study highlights early findings on the impact of COVID-19 on youth and families with T1D. Clinicians and researchers should consider the psychosocial impact of COVID-19 on youth with T1D and tailor diabetes care accordingly.","Dimentstein, Karen Yee Shanique Valenzuela Jessica M.; Pan, Bernard Snyder Meg Wolf Risa",Diabetes,79,1

Following the closure of the border of neighbouring French Polynesia, changes had to be made to the Pitcairn Islands’ sole supply vessel route, which resulted in the vessel requiring to set anchor on arrival at the island to conserve fuel. Considering this change and to ensure the continued protection of vulnerable coral habitats the local government has had to make swift decisions to identify anchoring zones that minimise seabed disturbance. Data collected in January 2020, just prior to the pandemic, were assessed using a rapid assessment method and combined with earth observation data to create the first shallow water (<~20 m) habitat map of this island. The results show the distribution of vulnerable coral communities and other habitats, achieving an accuracy of 68% compared with previously collected datasets making the results the best available evidence for management purposes. Although the seabed data were not originally collected for this analysis, having both video and stills imagery aligned with global positioning meant a rapid assessment method could be easily applied to the data. The assessment technique used has resulted in the first reliable habitat distribution maps to be produced in a management critical timeframe, providing managers with the evidence they required to make informed decisions relating to the protection and conservation of Pitcairn’s pristine, marine habitats during these unprecedented times.","Archer-Rand, Simeon Whomersley Paul O’Connor Joey Dosell Abbie",Frontiers in Marine Science,79,9

Further cases have since been reported in multiple countries. The reporting rates of these events indicate that they are very rare given the high numbers of vaccinated persons. Males and younger vaccinees appear more frequently affected, more often following the second vaccine dose. As vaccine programmes progress with the focus shifting to younger people, it is possible that more cases of myocarditis and pericarditis will be reported. Objectives: To bring together spontaneously reported data from around the world to estimate the reporting rate in different countries and better understand the risk factors for myocarditis and pericarditis following exposure to COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. Methods: Spontaneous reports from the United Kingdom, United States, and European Economic Area were used to estimate the frequency of myocarditis and pericarditis reported following COVID-19 Vaccine Pfizer/BioNTech and COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna. Cases were stratified by age, sex, and vaccine dose where data were available. Reporting rates amongst vaccinees receiving mRNA vaccines in each region were estimated. Results: A small number of reports of myocarditis and pericarditis had been submitted to each database examined. These events are very rare according to reporting rates of spontaneous adverse reactions. The events were more frequently reported amongst males, and most reports came from vaccinees aged under 30 years. The typical clinical course of these events is mild, with full recovery in most cases. Conclusions: This study provides evidence that younger vaccinees more frequently report myocarditis and pericarditis following mRNA COVID-19 vaccines compared with older vaccinees. These very rare events with mild clinical course followed by full recovery in most cases were more frequent following the second dose. Reporting rates of myocarditis and pericarditis were consistent between the data sources.","Lane, S.; Shakir, S.",,79,20

While hemichorea-hemiballism secondary to diabetic striatopathy is increasingly being reported, unilateral caudate atrophy resulting from chronic vascular insufficiency/insult in a backdrop of poorly controlled diabetes mellitus is sparsely described in literature. We herein report a 75-year-old woman with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus who presented with concurrent epilepsia partialis continua involving left side of her face and hemichorea on the right side in the context of non-ketotic hyperglycemia. Neuroimaging revealed a space-occupying lesion suggestive of low-grade glioma in the right superior frontal cortex and left-sided caudate atrophy as well. Possibly, space-occupying lesion in motor cortex acted as an inciting factor for seizures and non-ketotic hyperglycemia further lowered the seizures threshold. On the other hand, atrophied left caudate had led to persistent choreiform movements secondary to chronic uncontrolled hyperglycemia. The simultaneous presence of acute and chronic neurological complications of diabetes mellitus makes this case unique. It also highlights the need for strict control of blood glucose and utility of appropriate neuroimaging to rapidly diagnose and prevent further complications.","Chatterjee, S.; Ghosh, R.; Ojha, U.

In this study, we revisit the diversifying role of precious metals – gold, silver, and platinum – for six Dow Jones Islamic (DJI) equity index portfolios using a battery of tests: dynamic conditional correlations (DCCs), four-moment modified value at risk (VaR) and conditional VaR, and global minimum-variance (GMV) portfolio approach. Our empirical results exhibit drastically increased DCCs between sample assets during the COVID period;however, pairing gold with any of the DJI equity indices (except for the Asia-Pacific region) decreases the downside risk of these portfolios. Other precious metals (silver and platinum) do not provide such benefits. Furthermore, we find that a higher allocation of wealth in DJI Japanese equities and gold is required to achieve a GMV portfolio in the post-COVID-19 era, implying higher transaction (hedging) costs to rebalance portfolios (weights) accordingly. Our out-of-sample tests examining the global financial crisis, European debt crisis, and extended sample (2000-2020) periods yield similar findings as gold glitters across all market conditions.

This article seeks to fill this gap by qualitatively describing the ways in which infertility in Zambia is socially and culturally loaded for both men and women. Demonstrating fertility is necessary to be considered a full adult, a real man or woman, and to leave a legacy after death. People in Zambia, including medical professionals, currently lack the necessary information and access to (or ability to provide) care to effectively resolve fertility issues. Infertile people manage their experience through a variety of social, emotional, spiritual, and medical strategies. However, no solution is considered adequate unless the intervention results in childbirth. In this way, infertility is about producing babies and the social meaning of that process, rather than the raising of children.","Howe, S; Zulu, JM; Boivin, J; Gerrits, T",,79,19

The first chapter is the one of Tigerstedt's experiments about renin, and Loesch and Gollblatt's model of renal hypertension. The race to elucidate the mechanisms of angiotensin, angiotensinogen and the angiotensin conversion enzyme cascade, by Braun Menéndez and Page teams, is a second chapter. The puzzle of this elegant cascade is completed by aldosterone isolation by the collaboration of Tait spouses and Tadeus Rechstein. As a corollary of these findings, Conn made the first description of primary hyperaldosteronism. The elucidation of RAAS pathophysiology naturally led to the synthesis of the antihypertensive captopril by Ondetti and Cushman, thereby opening the modern era of ACE inhibitors and ARII blockers. In March 2020, a viral pandemic caused by SARS-Cov-2 ignites the entire planet. This new coronavirus uses the RAAS angiotensin conversion enzyme type 2 (ACE-2) as a gateway.

RESULTS Results: In Ukraine, the death rate from suicide in recent years averages 1.1% of the total number of deaths. The rate of suicide decline in Ukraine has slowed significantly over the past five years, which is an alarming symptom. There are almost strict proportions between male and female suicide (men commit four out of five suicides). The level of self-harm per 100,000 population of Ukraine remains almost stable, indicating a severe demographic crisis in Ukraine. Women in Ukraine are less likely to commit suicide than in European countries. In Ukraine in recent years, contrary to European trends, suicide has dominated among the elderly aged 65+. The number of years of potential life loss for male and female suicides in Ukraine is 103 thousand, and the number of working years is almost 100 thousand. The losses for Ukraine from the unlived life of those who died as a result of suicide in 2019 are almost USD 341 billion. CONCLUSION Conclusions: In 2019, suicides accounted for almost 21% of deaths from external causes among Ukraine's population. The most intense suicidal situation is observed in the central part of the country's geographical map along the imaginary vertical axis ""North-South"" (Kherson, Chernihiv, Cherkasy, Vinnytsia, Zaporizhia, Kirovohrad, Sumy, Poltava, Dnipropetrovsk, Mykolaiv regions). During the COVID-19 pandemic, many additional factors increase the risk of suicide among individuals who are at heightened risk of suicide or are actively suicidal, and among the general population.","Batyrgareieva, Vladyslava S; Kalinina, Alina V; Babenko, Andriy M",Wiadomosci lekarskie,79,1

(experimental and theoretical background).,13.434,9.823788,2021-09-01,"Fusion proteins of enveloped viruses categorized as class I are typified by two distinct heptad repeat domains within the transmembrane subunit. These repeats are important structural elements that assemble into the six-helix bundles characteristic of the fusion-activated envelope trimer. Peptides derived from these domains can be potent and specific inhibitors of membrane fusion and virus infection. To facilitate our understanding of retroviral entry, peptides corresponding to the two heptad repeat domains of the avian sarcoma and leukosis virus subgroup A (ASLV-A) TM subunit of the envelope protein were characterized. Two peptides corresponding to the C-terminal heptad repeat (HR2), offset from one another by three residues, were effective inhibitors of infection, while two overlapping peptides derived from the N-terminal heptad repeat (HR1) were not. Analysis of envelope mutants containing substitutions within the HR1 domain revealed that a single amino acid change, L62A, significantly reduced sensitivity to peptide inhibition. Virus bound to cells at 4 degrees C became sensitive to peptide within the first 5 min of elevating the temperature to 37 degrees C and lost sensitivity to peptide after 15 to 30 min, consistent with a transient intermediate in which the peptide binding site is exposed. In cell-cell fusion experiments, peptide inhibitor sensitivity occurred prior to a fusion-enhancing low-pH pulse. Soluble receptor for ASLV-A induces a lipophilic character in the envelope which can be measured by stable liposome binding, and this activation was found to be unaffected by inhibitory HR2 peptide. Finally, receptor-triggered conformational changes in the TM subunit were also found to be unaffected by inhibitory peptide. These changes are marked by a dramatic shift in mobility on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, from a subunit of 37 kDa to a complex of about 80 kDa. Biotinylated HR2 peptide bound specifically to the 80-kDa complex, demonstrating a surprisingly stable envelope conformation in which the HR2 binding site is exposed. These experiments support a model in which receptor interaction promotes formation of an envelope conformation in which the TM subunit is stably associated with its target membrane and is able to bind a C-terminal peptide.","Netter, Robert C; Amberg, Sean M; Balliet, John W; Biscone, Mark J; Vermeulen, Arwen; Earp, Laurie J; White, Judith M; Bates, Paul",Journal of virology,79,30

Therefore, it is important to investigate the infection risk of HCWs and the clinical characteristics of affected cases and possible source of infection with exposure details. The aim of this study is to analyze the medical records of HCWs with COVID-19 retrospectively and carry out the analysis of the data of HCWs with COVID-19 at TNMC and BYL Nair Charitable Hospital (NH, COVID-19 Hospital) in Mumbai. Interim analysis was carried out for the data collected from 6th April to 20th August 2020. Total 3711 HCWs (frontline, 74.32%, non-frontline, 25.68%) are working at NH Mumbai. We observed 11% prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among HCWs, 4% co-infection and 1% mortality. Majority (85%) of the HCWs with COVID-19 were symptomatic and 15% were asymptomatic. Comorbidities were reported in 19% of HCWs with COVID-19. Hypertension and Diabetes Mellitus were the most common co-morbidities reported. More than 4% percent of HCWs with COVID-19 were also positive for plasmodium vivax Malaria.

Remdesivir has got FDA approval as the first COVID-19 anti-viral agent in adult and paediatric patients (aged ≥12 years and weighing at least 40 kg) requiring hospitalization. OBJECTIVE The present prospective, observational, cross sectional study was planned to evaluate the impact of early initiation of Remdesivir on clinical outcomes in moderate to severe COVID 19 patients requiring ICU care. Materials and Methods: In this study, 100 consecutive symptomatic RT-PCR positive COVID 19 patients requiring admission to Intensive care unit based on predefined criteria were included for evaluation. All such moderate to severely ill patients were given Remdesivir intravenously as a 200-mg loading dose on day 1, followed by a 100-mg maintenance dose for the next four days along with other standard care. The main outcome measure analysed was the impact of early initiation of Remdesivir on recovery assessed by number of days in hospital, recovery, biochemical improvements and death. Results: Out of total 100 patients, 84 patients recovered with Remdesivir along with supportive treatment and were discharged from the hospital. Mean age of patients at presentation 53.5± 14.8 years with 5:1 male preponderance. Mean duration of hospital stay was 11.6 ± 5.9 days. D-dimer, CRP, Ferritin, IL-6 decreased significantly post treatment with P values <0.05, <0.001, <0.001, <0.01 respectively when compared to values at admission. No significant side effects were seen with remdesivir infusion. CONCLUSION This real-world experience suggests that in the subset of hospitalized patients with moderate to severe pneumonia, early use of Remdesivir can lead to better clinical outcomes and help in reduction of associated mortality and morbidity of COVID-19.","Waddankeri, Swaraj; Hesarur, Sharan Shravan; Hiremath, Swati S; A, Sangamesh; Ar, Shoukat; Raikod, Basavaraj Patil; Kinagi, Satish; Biradar, Sangram; Belli, Basavaraj; Melkundi, Shivanand; Singh, Gajendra",The Journal of the Association of Physicians of India,79,20

Critics of the Agreement fear that such action is inconsistent with ensuring access to medicines in the developing world. A WHO convened meeting on intellectual property rights and vaccines in developing countries, on which this paper is based, found no evidence that TRIPS has stimulated innovation in developing market vaccine development (where markets are weak) or that protection of intellectual property rights has had a negative effect on access to vaccines. However, access to future vaccines in the developing world could be threatened by compliance with TRIPS. The management of such threats requires adherence of all countries to the Doha Declaration on TRIPS, and the protections guaranteed by the Agreement itself, vigilance on TRIPS-plus elements of free trade agreements, developing frameworks for licensing and technology transfer, and promoting innovative vaccine development in developing countries.

A structured, self-administered questionnaire was made available online (26 March to 26 May 2010) for frontline public health workers employed by the communicable disease departments of the public health services in the Netherlands (n=302). A total of 166 questionnaires (55%) were completed. The majority of respondents reported an increased workload, perceived as too busy (117 respondents, 70.5%) or extreme (13 respondents, 7.8%). Most respondents were not anxious about becoming infected (only seven were regularly concerned). The overall compliance with the control measures was good. The case definition was strictly applied by 110 of the 166 respondents (66%); 56 of 141 (39.7%) consistently consulted the Preparedness and Response Unit within a centralised assessment system, while 68 of 141 (48.2%) consulted the unit only at the beginning of the pandemic. Of 145 respondents with available data, 128 (88.3%) always used personal protective equipment. Reported adherence to the advice to discuss the various isolation measures with patients and their contacts was between 71% and 98.7%. Our study shows that the surveyed frontline public health workers considered the workload to be high during the first 3.5 months of the pandemic and their level of anxiety about becoming infected was reported to be low. During the pandemic, these workers were able to accommodate what they considered to be an excessive workload, even though initially their assignments were unfamiliar to them.","Vinck, L; Isken, L; Hooiveld, M; Trompenaars, Mc; Ijzermans, J; Timen, A",Euro surveillance : bulletin Europeen sur les maladies transmissibles = European communicable disease bulletin,79,20

The aim of this review is to assess the available evidence for the use of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) in the care of patients during cardiological procedures. A systematic literature search was conducted using electronic bibliographic databases (MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE) from their first available date using the following search strategy: (spectroscopy, near-infrared OR infrared spectroscopy OR NIRS OR cerebral oxygen*) AND (interventional OR electrophysiological OR catheterization OR ablation OR ICD OR defibrillator). Inclusion criteria were limited to human studies, English language and cardiac patients. All manuscripts concerning the use of NIRS in every area of catheterization and electrophysiology were included. The literature search yielded eleven observational studies and five case reports concerning the research question. No randomized trials could be retrieved. Six studies evaluated NIRS during supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias, one during transcatheter aortic valve implantations, and four studies assessed the use of NIRS in pediatric catheterization procedures. Overall, the studies demonstrated that NIRS provides a very quick representation of cerebral oxygen saturation and that it might identify changes that could not be predicted from standard hemodynamic monitoring. However, the evidence is currently too low to conclude that NIRS can optimize patient care during cardiological procedures.","Moerman, Annelies; Meert, Frederik; De Hert, Stefan",Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,79,24

METHODS: Our study is a phase 1, randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled trial at a specialised clinical trials centre in Australia. We enrolled healthy adult volunteers in two age groups: younger adults (aged 18-54 years) and older adults (aged 55-75 years). Participants were randomly allocated either vaccine or placebo using a list prepared by the study funder. Participants were to receive two doses of SCB-2019 (either 3 µg, 9 µg, or 30 µg) or a placebo (0·9% NaCl) 21 days apart. SCB-2019 either had no adjuvant (S-Trimer protein alone) or was adjuvanted with AS03 or CpG/Alum. The assigned treatment was administered in opaque syringes to maintain masking of assignments. Reactogenicity was assessed for 7 days after each vaccination. Humoral responses were measured as SCB-2019 binding IgG antibodies and ACE2-competitive blocking IgG antibodies by ELISA and as neutralising antibodies by wild-type SARS-CoV-2 microneutralisation assay. Cellular responses to pooled S-protein peptides were measured by flow-cytometric intracellular cytokine staining. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04405908; this is an interim analysis and the study is continuing. FINDINGS: Between June 19 and Sept 23, 2020, 151 volunteers were enrolled; three people withdrew, two for personal reasons and one with an unrelated serious adverse event (pituitary adenoma). 148 participants had at least 4 weeks of follow-up after dose two and were included in this analysis (database lock, Oct 23, 2020). Vaccination was well tolerated, with two grade 3 solicited adverse events (pain in 9 µg AS03-adjuvanted and 9 µg CpG/Alum-adjuvanted groups). Most local adverse events were mild injection-site pain, and local events were more frequent with SCB-2019 formulations containing AS03 adjuvant (44-69%) than with those containing CpG/Alum adjuvant (6-44%) or no adjuvant (3-13%). Systemic adverse events were more frequent in younger adults (38%) than in older adults (17%) after the first dose but increased to similar levels in both age groups after the second dose (30% in older and 34% in younger adults). SCB-2019 with no adjuvant elicited minimal immune responses (three seroconversions by day 50), but SCB-2019 with fixed doses of either AS03 or CpG/Alum adjuvants induced high titres and seroconversion rates of binding and neutralising antibodies in both younger and older adults (anti-SCB-2019 IgG antibody geometric mean titres at day 36 were 1567-4452 with AS03 and 174-2440 with CpG/Alum). Titres in all AS03 dose groups and the CpG/Alum 30 µg group were higher than were those recorded in a panel of convalescent serum samples from patients with COVID-19. Both adjuvanted SCB-2019 formulations elicited T-helper-1-biased CD4+ T-cell responses. INTERPRETATION: The SCB-2019 vaccine, comprising S-Trimer protein formulated with either AS03 or CpG/Alum adjuvants, elicited robust humoral and cellular immune responses against SARS-CoV-2, with high viral neutralising activity. Both adjuvanted vaccine formulations were well tolerated and are suitable for further clinical development.

PM014 (HL301) is the herbal extract derived from the herbal medicine Chung-Sang-Bo-Ha-Tang which is used for the treatment of lung diseases. METHODS: To evaluate the effect of PM014 on the lung inflammation induced by fine dust, this study investigated inflammatory responses in the lung upon pm10 exposure by examining the infiltration of inflammatory cell profiles from bronchial alveolar lavage fluid (BALF), lung histology, and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines measured by RT-PCR and ELISA. RESULTS: PM014-treated mice exhibited reduced lung tissue damage and inflammatory cell infiltration. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) analysis showed significant decrease in the population of total cells, macrophages, eosinophils, and neutrophils in PM014-treated mice. PM014 treatment downregulated the pro-inflammatory cytokine expressions including IL-1b, IL-8, IL-6, TNF-alpha, IL-21 and IL-17. ELISA analysis also showed reduced production of IL-1b, IL-6 and IL-17 in PM014-treated mice. CONCLUSION: PM014 suppressed the pm10-induced inflammatory response in mice. This study shows that PM014 is a possible therapeutic agent for lung inflammation induced by fine dust.","Lee, Ye-Seul; Min, Daeun; Park, Seon-Young; Lee, Junyoung; Bae, Hyunsu",BMC Complement Med Ther,79,21

To this end we depart from using the classic bilinear infection process, but remain still within the framework of the mass-action assumption. From the mathematical point of view our model is interesting due to the lack of continuous differentiability at disease free steady states, which implies also that the basic reproductive number cannot be computed following established approaches for certain parameter values. However, we parametrise our mathematical model using published values from the COVID-19 literature, and analyse the model simulations. We also contrast model simulations against publicly available COVID-19 test data focusing on the first wave of the pandemic during March - July 2020 in the UK. Our simulations indicate that actual peak case numbers might have been as much as 200 times higher than the reported positive test cases during the first wave in the UK. We find that very strong adherence to self-quarantine rules yields (only) a reduction of 22$\%$ of peak numbers and delays the onset of the peak by approximately 30-35 days. However, during the early phase of the outbreak the impact of (self)-quarantine is much more significant. We also take into account the effect of a national lockdown in a simplistic way by reducing the effective susceptible population size. We find that in case of a 90$\%$ reduction of the effective susceptible population size, strong adherence to self-quarantine still only yields a 25$\%$ reduction of peak infectious numbers when compared to low adherence. This is due to the significant number of asymptomatic infectious individuals in the population.","Farkas, Jozsef Z.; Chatzopoulos, Roxane",,79,24

Dorsal tongue and gingiva, saliva, and tongue coating samples were examined to determine the presence of these molecules in the oral cavity. Immunohistochemical analyses showed that ACE2 was expressed in the stratified squamous epithelium of the dorsal tongue and gingiva. TMPRSS2 was strongly expressed in stratified squamous epithelium in the keratinized surface layer and detected in the saliva and tongue coating samples via Western blot. Furin was localized mainly in the lower layer of stratified squamous epithelium and detected in the saliva but not tongue coating. ACE2, TMPRSS2, and furin mRNA expression was observed in taste bud-derived cultured cells, which was similar to the immunofluorescence observations. These data showed that essential molecules for SARS-CoV-2 infection were abundant in the oral cavity. However, the database analysis showed that saliva also contains many protease inhibitors. Therefore, although the oral cavity may be the entry route for SARS-CoV-2, other factors including protease inhibitors in the saliva that inhibit viral entry should be considered.","Sakaguchi, Wakako; Kubota, Nobuhisa; Shimizu, Tomoko; Saruta, Juri; Fuchida, Shinya; Kawata, Akira; Yamamoto, Yuko; Sugimoto, Masahiro; Yakeishi, Mayumi; Tsukinoki, Keiichi",,79,32

METHODS: 752 adult respondents from a previous random sample participated in a telephone survey from 20 April to 11 May 2020. We examined demographic and socioeconomic factors, worry of COVID-19, general health, economic activity, and personal protective equipment (PPE) and related hygiene practice by deprivation status. The associations between deprivation and negative COVID-19 related issues were analysed using binary logistic regressions, while the associations of these issues with health were analysed using linear regressions. Path analysis was conducted to determine the direct effect of deprivation, and the indirect effects via COVID-19 related issues, on health. Interactions between deprivation and the mediators were also tested. RESULTS: Deprived individuals were more likely to have job loss/instability, less reserves, less utilisation and more concerns of PPE. After adjustments for potential confounders, being deprived was associated with having greater risk of low reserve of face masks, being worried about the disease and job loss/instability. Being deprived had worse physical (ß=-0.154, p<0.001) and mental health (ß=-0.211, p<0.001) and had an indirect effect on mental health via worry and job loss/instability (total indirect effect: ß=-0.027, p=0.017; proportion being mediated=11.46%). In addition, significant interaction between deprivation and change of economic activity status was observed on mental health-related quality of life. CONCLUSION: Even if the COVID-19 incidence was relatively low, part of the observed health inequality can be explained by people's concerns over livelihood and economic activity, which were affected by the containment measures. We should look beyond the incidence to address COVID-19 related health inequalities.","Chung, Roger Yat-Nork; Chung, Gary Ka-Ki; Marmot, Michael; Allen, Jessica; Chan, Dicken; Goldblatt, Peter; Wong, Hung; Lai, Eric; Woo, Jean; Yeoh, Eng-Kiong; Wong, Samuel Y S",J. epidemiol. community health (1979),79,32

Although not much was known about the new virus, the first outbreaks in China and Italy showed that potentially a large number of people worldwide could fall critically ill in a short period of time. A shortage of ventilators and intensive care resources was expected in many countries, leading to concerns about restrictions of medical care and preventable deaths. In order to be prepared for this challenging situation, national triage guidance has been developed or adapted from former influenza pandemic guidelines in an increasing number of countries over the past few months. In this article, we provide a comparative analysis of triage recommendations from selected national and international professional societies, including Australia/New Zealand, Belgium, Canada, Germany, Great Britain, Italy, Pakistan, South Africa, Switzerland, the United States, and the International Society of Critical Care Medicine. We describe areas of consensus, including the importance of prognosis, patient will, transparency of the decision-making process, and psychosocial support for staff, as well as the role of justice and benefit maximization as core principles. We then probe areas of disagreement, such as the role of survival versus outcome, long-term versus short-term prognosis, the use of age and comorbidities as triage criteria, priority groups and potential tiebreakers such as 'lottery' or 'first come, first served'. Having explored a number of tensions in current guidance, we conclude with a suggestion for framework conditions that are clear, consistent and implementable. This analysis is intended to advance the ongoing debate regarding the fair allocation of limited resources and may be relevant for future policy-making.","Jöbges, Susanne; Vinay, Rasita; Luyckx, Valerie A; Biller-Andorno, Nikola",Bioethics,79,16

As immunity accumulates in a population - naturally during the course of an epidemic or through vaccination - the spread of an infectious disease is limited by the depletion of susceptible hosts. If a sufficient proportion of the population is immune - above the 'herd immunity threshold' - then transmission generally cannot be sustained. Maintaining herd immunity is therefore critical to long-term disease control. In this primer, we discuss the concept of herd immunity from first principles, clarify common misconceptions, and consider the implications for disease control.","Ashby, Ben; Best, Alex",Curr Biol,79,20

Underpowering and lack of reproducibility due to small sample sizes have weakened conclusions of these investigations. In other disciplines, such as neuroeconomics and social sciences, crowdsourcing has been extensively utilized as a data collection tool, and a means to increase sample sizes. Recent methodological advances allow scientists, for the first time, to test online more complex cognitive, perceptual, and motor tasks. Here we review the nascent literature on the use of online crowdsourcing in cognitive and human systems neuroscience. These investigations take advantage of the ability to reliably track the activity of a participant's computer keyboard, mouse, and eye gaze in the context of large-scale studies online that involve diverse research participant pools. Crowdsourcing allows for testing the generalizability of behavioral hypotheses in real-life environments that are less accessible to lab-designed investigations. Crowdsourcing is further useful when in-laboratory studies are limited, for example during the current COVID-19 pandemic. We also discuss current limitations of crowdsourcing research, and suggest pathways to address them.

This study evaluated claims data to determine if risks for CV events were increased with hydroxychloroquine alone or combined with azithromycin. We identified data from 43,752 enrollees that qualified for analysis. The number of CV events increased by 25 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 8, 42, p=0.005) per 1000 people per year of treatment with hydroxychloroquine alone compared with pretreatment levels and by 201 (95% CI: 145, 256, p<0.001) events per 1000 people per year when individuals took hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. These rates translate to an additional 0.34 (95% CI: 0.11, 0.58) CV events per 1000 patients placed on a 5-day treatment with hydroxychloroquine monotherapy and 2.75 (95% CI: 1.99, 3.51) per 1000 patients on a 5-day treatment with both hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. The rate of adverse events increased with age following exposure to hydroxychloroquine alone and combined with azithromycin. For females aged 60 to 79 years prescribed hydroxychloroquine, the rate of adverse CV events was 0.92 per 1000 patients on 5 days of therapy, but it increased to 4.78 per 1000 patients when azithromycin was added. The rate of adverse CV events did not differ significantly from zero for patients 60 years of age or younger. These data suggest that hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin is likely safe in individuals under 60 years of age if they do not have additional CV risks. However, the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin should be used with extreme caution in older patients.","Simmering, Jacob E; Polgreen, Linnea A; Polgreen, Philip M; Teske, Rebecca E; Comellas, Alejandro P; Carter, Barry L",Pharmacotherapy,79,32

In the early stages of the epidemic, healthcare professionals have been in the front-line to manage the infection. The current study aimed to analyse the impact of COVID-19 outbreak on healthcare professionals and to detect some risk and protective factors of their distress levels, with regard to socio-demographic variables, direct exposure to COVID-19 and the coping strategies used to deal with stress. The data were collected during the peak of the infection. A total of 595 healthcare professionals enrolled in the study and completed the measures of socio-demographical and professional data, perceived stress (PSS) and coping strategies (COPE- NVI-25). Overall, we found that a positive attitude towards the stressful situation was the main protective factor, while female gender, seeking social support, avoidance strategies and working with COVID-19 patients were risk factors. Economic status, problem solving ability and turning to religion were not associated with stress levels. This study, one of the first on this topic, highlighted the main coping strategies used by healthcare professionals in facing the highly stressful situation caused by the pandemic.","Babore, Alessandra; Lombardi, Lucia; Viceconti, Maria Luisa; Pignataro, Silvia; Marino, Valentina; Crudele, Monia; Candelori, Carla; Bramanti, Sonia Monique; Trumello, Carmen",Psychiatry Res,79,5

Many mechanisms have been found to be related to this clinical phenomenon. Predicting this event by using hematological biomarkers may provide opportunities for adopting preventive measures against unfavorable neurovascular complications. The aim of this study is to determine the hematological predictors of carotid artery vasospasm during carotid stenting. Material and methods: A total of 120 patients who underwent carotid stenting were divided into two groups: those with and without carotid artery vasospasm. Carotid artery vasospasm was angiographically defined as transient or persistent emergent stenosis or irregularity of the vessel wall without evidence of thrombosis during carotid stenting. The hematological parameters were compared between 21 patients who developed carotid artery vasospasm (17.5%) and 99 patients who did not (82.5%). Results: The mean age of the patients with carotid artery vasospasm and without carotid artery vasospasm was 66 ±8 and 70 ±8 years, respectively. Creatinine levels within 0.5-0.9 (OR = 3.704, 95% CI: 1.245-11.019, p = 0.019), each 1000 unit increase in neutrophil count (OR = 1.567, 95% CI: 1.027-2.392, p = 0.037) and presence of diabetes (OR = 3.081, 95% CI: 1.116-8.505, p = 0.030) were the independent predictors of carotid artery vasospasm in carotid arteries during carotid stenting. Conclusions: The prediction of carotid artery vasospasm during carotid stenting should help clinicians adopt preventive measures against the development of neurological sequelae. This study found that creatinine levels, increased neutrophil count and presence of diabetes are independent predictors of carotid artery vasospasm.","Can, Yusuf; Kocayigit, Ibrahim",Arch Med Sci Atheroscler Dis,79,32

We examined the association between family caregiving and changes in the depressive symptom status during the pandemic. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 957 (mean age [standard deviation] = 80.8 [4.8] years; 53.5% females) community-dwelling older adults aged &#8805; 65 years from a semi-urban area of Japan, who completed a mailed questionnaire. Based on the depressive symptom status assessed with the Two-Question Screen between March and October 2020, participants were classified into four groups: ""non-depressive symptoms,"" ""incidence of depressive symptoms,"" ""remission from depressive symptoms,"" or ""persistence of depressive symptoms."" Participants were assessed in October 2020 for the family caregiving status, caregiving role, the severity of care recipients' needs, and increased caregiver burden during the pandemic, each with the simple question. Multinomial logistic regression analysis was applied to obtain the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for changes in depressive symptom status. RESULTS: Compared to non-caregivers, family caregivers were associated with the incidence (OR [95% CI] = 3.17 [1.55-6.51], p < 0.01) and persistence of depressive symptoms (OR [95% CI] = 2.39 [1.30-4.38], p < 0.01).

We aim to study the clinical course of COVID-19 patients with preexisting stroke and to investigate death-related risk factors. METHODS: We consecutively included 651 adult inpatients with COVID-19 from the Central Hospital of Wuhan between January 2 and February 15, 2020. Data on the demography, comorbidities, clinical manifestations, laboratory findings, treatments, complications, and outcomes (ie, discharged or death) of the participants were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between patients with and without preexisting stroke. The association between risk factors and mortality was estimated using a Cox proportional hazards regression model for stroke patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. RESULTS: Of the 651 patients with COVID-19, 49 with preexisting stroke tended to be elderly, male, had more underlying comorbidities and greater severity of illness, prolonged length of hospital stay, and greater hospitalization expenses than those without preexisting stroke. Cox regression analysis indicated that the patients with stroke had a higher risk of developing critical pneumonia (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.01 [95% CI, 1.27-3.16]) and subsequent mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.73 [95% CI, 1.00-2.98]) than the patients without stroke. Among the 49 stroke patients, older age and higher score of Glasgow Coma Scale or Sequential Organ Failure Assessment were independent risk factors associated with in-hospital mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Preexisting stroke patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 were readily predisposed to death, providing an important message to individuals and health care workers that preventive measures must be implemented to protect and reduce transmission in stroke patients in this COVID-19 crisis.","Zhang, Lijuan; Sun, Wenwu; Wang, Yujun; Wang, Xiaopin; Liu, Yanli; Zhao, Su; Long, Ding; Chen, Liangkai; Yu, Li",Stroke,79,15

To combat the pandemic, multiple types of vaccines are under development with unprecedented rapidity. Theoretically, future vaccination against COVID-19 may fall into long-term costly guerrilla warfare between SARS-CoV-2 and humans. Elimination of SARS-CoV-2 through vaccination to avoid the potential long-term costly guerrilla warfare, if possible, is highly desired and worth intensive consideration. Human influenza pandemics emerging in 1957, 1968, and 2009 established strong global herd immunity and led to the elimination of three human influenza viruses, which circulated worldwide for years before the pandemics. Moreover, both clade 7.2 of subtype H5 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus and subtype H7N9 avian influenza virus circulated in poultry in China for years, and they have been virtually eliminated through mass vaccination in recent years. These facts suggest that the rapid establishment of global herd immunity through mass vaccination using an appropriate vaccine could eliminate SARS-CoV-2. The coming 2 years are a golden time for elimination through vaccination, which requires tremendous national and international collaboration.

This review summarizes recent evidence on the relationship between psychiatric disorders, substance use disorders and COVID-19, highlighting acute and long-term risks, pharmacotherapy interactions and implications regarding appropriate and timely evidence-based treatment. RECENT FINDINGS: Evidence points to a complex relationship between psychiatric and substance use disorders and COVID-19. A range of risk factors associated with psychiatric and substance use disorders increases the risk of exposure to, and complications arising from, the COVID-19 virus. COVID-19 infection has been indicated as having acute and potential long-term impacts on both psychiatric and substance use disorders. Social disruption associated with restrictions imposed to curb transmission has also been identified as a risk factor for new onset of disorders and recurrence and exacerbation of existing conditions. SUMMARY: Early recognition and intervention are key to preventing chronic disability associated with psychiatric disorders, substance use disorders, and their co-occurrence. It is critical that those most in need of services do not fall through the cracks of our healthcare systems. The pandemic has fast tracked the opportunity for widespread implementation of digital health interventions but ensuring these are accessible and available to all, including our most vulnerable, will be a critical task for our future health and social ecosystems.","Marel, Christina; Mills, Katherine L; Teesson, Maree",Curr Opin Psychiatry,79,16

METHOD: A web-based cross-sectional survey was administered during and shortly after the COVID-19 related lockdown in Spain and Greece. Multivariable linear regression analyses were performed to identify country differences associated with eating behaviour, and symptoms of depression and anxiety. RESULTS: This study included 1,002 responders in Spain and 839 in Greece. The mean ± SD of restraint, emotional and external eating was 2.5 ± 0.79, 2.1 ± 0.81 and 2.6 ± 0.65 in Spain, whereas 2.7 ± 0.85, 2.3 ± 0.99 and 2.9 ± 0.74 in Greece. Spanish participants had lower average scores of restraint and external eating compared to Greek participants (p < .001), but no difference was seen for emotional eating. In Spain, 13.6%, and 12.3% of the survey respondents reported moderate to severe depressive and anxiety symptoms, respectively, whereas in Greece the respective values were 18.8 and 13.2%. After adjusting for several risk factors, a higher prevalence of anxiety symptoms was observed in Spain compared to Greece (p = .001), but no difference was seen for depressive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated high scores of inappropriate eating behaviours and a high frequency of depressive and anxiety symptoms in two Mediterranean countries during the COVID-19 outbreak. Our findings revealed that compared to Greek participants, Spanish participants, that faced more severe COVID-19 pandemic and stricter lockdown measures, were associated with lower restraint and external eating and increased anxiety symptoms, but not with depressive symptoms or emotional eating.","Papandreou, Christopher; Arija, Victoria; Aretouli, Eleni; Tsilidis, Konstantinos K; Bulló, Mònica",,79,8

Late May, 2020, over 100,000 COVID-19 related deaths were reported in the United State, the highest number of any country. This article describes COVID-19 as the next historical turning point in the physical therapy profession's growth and development. The profession has had over a 100-year tradition of responding to epidemics including poliomyelitis; two world wars and geographical regions experiencing conflicts and natural disasters; and the epidemic of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). The evidence-based role of non-invasive interventions (non-pharmacologic/non-surgical) that hallmark physical therapist practice has emerged as being highly relevant today in addressing COVID-19 in two primary ways. First, despite some unique features, COVID-19 presents as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in its severe acute stage. ARDS is well familiar to physical therapists in intensive care units. Body positioning and mobilization, prescribed based on comprehensive assessments/examinations, counter the negative sequelae of recumbency and bedrest; augment gas exchange and reduce airway closure, deconditioning and critical illness complications; and maximize long-term functional outcomes. Physical therapists have an indisputable role across the COVID-19 care continuum. Second, over 90% of individuals who contract and die from COVID-19 have co-morbidities, most notably cardiovascular disease, hypertension, chronic lung disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and obesity. Physical therapists need to redouble their efforts to address NCDs by assessing patients for risk factors and manifestations and institute evidence-based health education (smoking cessation, whole-food plant-based nutrition, weight control, physical activity/exercise), and/or support patients' efforts when these are managed by other professionals.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between May 4th, 2020 and June 11th, 2020, a total of 1,021 consecutive patients (492 males, 529 females; mean age: 62.3±15.1 years; range, 13 to 91 years) who were scheduled for elective orthopedic surgery were included. A screening questionnaire was applied to all patients. The patients admitted to hospital were also tested for COVID-19 infection through reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction of the nasopharyngeal swab. RESULTS: Of the patients, 1,003 (98.2%) underwent elective surgery as planned. The screening questionnaire classified 30 patients as high-risk for COVID-19. A total of 18 procedures (n=18, 1.8%) were postponed due to the high risk of possible transmission of COVID-19. None of 991 low-risk patients were tested positive for COVID-19.

We hypothesize that validated VTE risk scores would have prognostic ability in this population. Methods Retrospective observational cohort with severe COVID-19 performed in NorthShore University Health System. Patients were &gt;18 years of age and met criteria for inpatient or intensive care unit (ICU) care. The International Medical Prevention Registry on Venous Thromboembolism (IMPROVE) and Caprini scores were calculated and patients were stratified. Results This study includes 184 patients, mostly men (63.6%), Caucasian (54.3%), 63 years old (interquartile range [IQR]: 24-101), and 57.1% of them required ICU care. Twenty-seven (14.7%) thrombotic events occurred: 12 (6.5%) cases of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), 9 (4.9%) of pulmonary embolism, 5 (2.7%) of deep vein thrombosis, and 1 (0.5%) stroke. Among them, 86 patients (46.7%) died, 95 (51.6%) were discharged, and 3 (1.6%) were still hospitalized. ""Moderate risk for VTE"" and ""High risk for VTE"" by IMPROVE score had significant mortality association: (hazard ratio [HR]: 5.68;95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.93-11.03;p &lt; 0.001) and (HR = 6.22;95% CI: 3.04-12.71;p &lt; 0.001), respectively, with 87% sensitivity and 63% specificity (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.752, p &lt; 0.001). ""High Risk for VTE"" by Caprini score had significant mortality association (HR = 17.6;95% CI: 5.56-55.96;p &lt; 0.001) with 96% sensitivity and 55% specificity (AUC = 0.843, p &lt; 0.001).

Regulatory T cells (Treg) play a critical role for immune homeostasis, but may inhibit pathogen-specific immunity in infectious disorders. The present review summarizes the current knowledge about Treg in human CNS infections and their animal models. Besides dampening pathogen-induced immunopathology, Treg have the ability to facilitate protective responses by supporting effector T cell trafficking to the infection site and the development of resident memory T cells. Moreover, Treg can reduce virus replication by inducing apoptosis of infected macrophages and attenuate neurotoxic astrogliosis and pro-inflammatory microglial responses. By contrast, detrimental effects of Treg are caused by suppression of antiviral immunity, allowing for virus persistence and latency. Opposing disease outcomes following Treg manipulation in different models might be attributed to differences in technique and timing of intervention, infection route, genetic background, and the host's age. In addition, mouse models of virus-induced demyelination revealed that Treg are able to reduce autoimmunity and immune-mediated CNS damage in a disease phase-dependent manner. Understanding the unique properties of Treg and their complex interplay with effector cells represents a prerequisite for the development of new therapeutic approaches in neurotropic virus infections.","Ciurkiewicz, Malgorzata; Herder, Vanessa; Beineke, Andreas",,79,32

While molecular detection tools enable identification of respiratory viruses in wheezing children, it remains unclear if and how these viruses are associated with wheezing. The objective of this systematic review is to clarify the prevalence of different respiratory viruses in children with wheezing. METHODS: We performed an electronic in Pubmed and Global Index Medicus on 01 July 2019 and manual search. We performed search of studies that have detected common respiratory viruses in children &#8804;18 years with wheezing. We included only studies using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. Study data were extracted and the quality of articles assessed. We conducted sensitivity, subgroup, publication bias, and heterogeneity analyses using a random effects model. RESULTS: The systematic review included 33 studies. Rhinovirus, with a prevalence of 35.6% (95% CI 24.6-47.3, I2 98.4%), and respiratory syncytial virus, at 31.0% (95% CI 19.9-43.3, I2 96.4%), were the most common viruses detected. The prevalence of other respiratory viruses was as follows: human bocavirus 8.1% (95% CI 5.3-11.3, I2 84.6%), human adenovirus 7.7% (95% CI 2.6-15.0, I2 91.0%), influenza virus6.5% (95% CI 2.2-12.6, I2 92.4%), human metapneumovirus5.8% (95% CI 3.4-8.8, I2 89.0%), enterovirus 4.3% (95% CI 0.1-12.9, I2 96.2%), human parainfluenza virus 3.8% (95% CI 1.5-6.9, I2 79.1%), and human coronavirus 2.2% (95% CI 0.6-4.4, I2 79.4%). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that rhinovirus and respiratory syncytial virus may contribute to the etiology of wheezing in children. While the clinical implications of molecular detection of respiratory viruses remains an interesting question, this study helps to illuminate the potential of role respiratory viruses in pediatric wheezing.

Although the application of big data technology for COVID-19 warning and monitoring remain important tasks, prevention of the disease's rapid spread and reduction of its impact on society are currently the most pressing challenges for the application of big data technology during the COVID-19 pandemic. After the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, the Chinese government and nongovernmental organizations actively used big data technology to prevent, contain, and control the spread of COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to discuss the application of big data technology to prevent, contain, and control COVID-19 in China; draw lessons; and make recommendations. METHODS: We discuss the data collection methods and key data information that existed in China before the outbreak of COVID-19 and how these data contributed to the prevention and control of COVID-19. Next, we discuss China's new data collection methods and new information assembled after the outbreak of COVID-19. Based on the data and information collected in China, we analyzed the application of big data technology from the perspectives of data sources, data application logic, data application level, and application results. In addition, we analyzed the issues, challenges, and responses encountered by China in the application of big data technology from four perspectives: data access, data use, data sharing, and data protection. Suggestions for improvements are made for data collection, data circulation, data innovation, and data security to help understand China's response to the epidemic and to provide lessons for other countries' prevention and control of COVID-19. RESULTS: In the process of the prevention and control of COVID-19 in China, big data technology has played an important role in personal tracking, surveillance and early warning, tracking of the virus's sources, drug screening, medical treatment, resource allocation, and production recovery. The data used included location and travel data, medical and health data, news media data, government data, online consumption data, data collected by intelligent equipment, and epidemic prevention data. We identified a number of big data problems including low efficiency of data collection, difficulty in guaranteeing data quality, low efficiency of data use, lack of timely data sharing, and data privacy protection issues. To address these problems, we suggest unified data collection standards, innovative use of data, accelerated exchange and circulation of data, and a detailed and rigorous data protection system. CONCLUSIONS: China has used big data technology to prevent and control COVID-19 in a timely manner. To prevent and control infectious diseases, countries must collect, clean, and integrate data from a wide range of sources; use big data technology to analyze a wide range of big data; create platforms for data analyses and sharing; and address privacy issues in the collection and use of big data.","Wu, Jun; Wang, Jian; Nicholas, Stephen; Maitland, Elizabeth; Fan, Qiuyan",J Med Internet Res,79,30

The receptor-binding motif (RBM) region of the causative virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), binds to host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors for infection. As ACE2 receptors are highly conserved within vertebrate species, SARS-CoV-2 can infect significant animal species as well as human populations. An analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genotypes isolated from human and significant animal species was conducted to compare and identify mutation and adaptation patterns across different animal species. The phylogenetic data revealed seven distinct phylogenetic clades with no significant relationship between the clades and geographical locations. A high rate of variation within SARS-CoV-2 mink isolates implies that mink populations were infected before human populations. Positions of most single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 genotypes from the different hosts are mostly accumulated in the RBM region and highlight the pronounced accumulation of variants with mutations in the RBM region in comparison with other variants. These SNPs play a crucial role in viral transmission and pathogenicity and are keys in identifying other animal species as potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2. The possible roles in the emergence of new viral strains and the possible implications of these changes, in compromising vaccine effectiveness, deserve urgent considerations.","Ghorbani, Abozar; Samarfard, Samira; Eskandarzade, Neda; Afsharifar, Alireza; Eskandari, Mohammad Hadi; Niazi, Ali; Izadpanah, Keramatollah; Karbanowicz, Thomas P",Brief. bioinform,79,32

Herein, we studied the earliest patients admitted to our centre in order to clarify the typical radiological findings, particularly computed tomography (CT) findings, associated with COVID-19. METHODS: From 22 January 2020 to 29 February 2020, 19 patients with confirmed COVID-19 underwent high-resolution or conventional CT scans of the thorax in our centre. The CT imaging findings of these patients with confirmed COVID-19 in Hong Kong were reviewed in this study. RESULTS: Ground-glass opacities (GGO) with peripheral subpleural distribution were found in all patients (100%). No specific zonal predominance was observed. All lobes were involved in 16 (84.2%) patients, focal subsegmental consolidations were observed in 14 (73.7%) patients, and interlobular septal thickening was present in 12 (63.2%) patients. No mediastinal lymph node enlargement, centrilobular nodule, or pleural effusion was detected in any of the patients. Other imaging features present in several patients include bronchial dilatation, bronchial wall thickening, and crazy-paving patterns. CONCLUSIONS: Peripheral subpleural GGO without zonal predominance in the absence of centrilobular nodule, pleural effusion, and lymph node enlargement were consistent findings in patients with confirmed COVID-19. The observed radiological patterns on CT scans can help identify COVID-19 and assess affected patients in the context of the ongoing outbreak.","Li, S K; Ng, F H; Ma, K F; Luk, W H; Lee, Y C; Yung, K S",Hong Kong Med J,79,7

CIP can be adapted as a single session for a COVID-19 mental health emergency or for a hotline or as 2 to 20 sessions of treatment with COVID-19 patients and families offered virtually on a psychiatric inpatient unit, through a consultation-liaison service, or in outpatient settings. This article reviews the history of critical incident stress management and the use of its replacement, psychological first aid. The history and core principles of crisis psychotherapy and 8 core elements of treatment are described. The use of digital and virtual technology has enabled the delivery of crisis psychotherapy during the COVID-19 pandemic. A case study of a family impacted by COVID-19 is reported as an illustration. The use of a 6-week timeline, an ecological map, and a problem-solving wheel-and-spoke treatment plan are demonstrated.","Feinstein, Robert E",J Psychiatr Pract,79,33

Previous studies have found that many patients had a procoagulant state and/or severe hypoxemia with relatively well-preserved lung mechanics. Mechanisms underlying the damage to vascular tissues are not well-elucidated yet. Histological data in COVID-19 patients are still limited and are mainly focused on post-mortem analysis. Given that the skin is affected by COVID-19 and the relative ease of its histological examination, we aimed to examine the histology of skin lesions in COVID-19 patients to better understand the disease's pathology. METHODS: Five skin lesions from COVID-19 adult patients were selected for a deep histological tissue examination. RESULTS: A strong vasculopathic reaction pattern based on prominent vascular endothelial and myointimal cell growth was identified. Endothelial cell distortion generated vascular lumen obliteration and striking erythrocyte and serum extravasation. Significant deposition of C4d and C3 throughout the vascular cell wall was also identified. A regenerative epidermal hyperplasia with tissue structure preservation was also observed. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 could comprise an obliterative microangiopathy consisting on endothelial and myointimal growth with complement activation. This mechanism, together with the increased vascular permeability identified, could contribute to obliteration of the vascular lumen and hemorrhage in COVID-19. Thus, anticoagulation by itself could not completely reverse vascular lumen obliteration, with consequent increased risk of hemorrhage. Findings of this study could contribute to a better understanding of physiopathological mechanisms underlying COVID-19 on living patients and could help further studies find potential targets for specific therapeutic interventions in severe cases.","Valtueña, Jara; Martínez-García, Gerardo; Ruiz-Sánchez, Daniel; Garayar-Cantero, María; Dueñas, Carlos; Hadi, Ali; Hadi, Suhail; Aguado-García, Ángel; Prieto de Paula, José M; Manchado-López, Pilar",Int J Dermatol,79,16

MEASURES: We assessed the reach, impact, and costs of Re-ACT and compared these measures to in-person ACT courses. INTERVENTIONS: About 45-60 minutes of synchronous, remote sessions consisting of a didactic introduction to SIC skills, tailored to the SARS-Cov-2 (COVID-19) crisis, and a live demonstration of SICs with patient-actors. OUTCOMES: The transition to Re-ACT sessions resulted in reaching a greater number of clinicians in less time, although depth of content and opportunities for skill practice decreased. Although both formats were well received, Re-ACT respondents felt less prepared than ACT respondents to use SIC skills. The costs of Re-ACT were significantly less than in-person ACT courses.

The geographic heterogeneity and associated intervention strategies highlight the need to monitor in real time the transmission potential of COVID-19. Singapore provides a unique case example for monitoring transmission, as there have been multiple disease clusters, yet transmission remains relatively continued. METHODS: Here we estimate the effective reproduction number, Rt, of COVID-19 in Singapore from the publicly available daily case series of imported and autochthonous cases by date of symptoms onset, after adjusting the local cases for reporting delays as of March 17, 2020. We also derive the reproduction number from the distribution of cluster sizes using a branching process analysis that accounts for truncation of case counts. RESULTS: The local incidence curve displays sub-exponential growth dynamics, with the reproduction number following a declining trend and reaching an estimate at 0.7 (95% CI 0.3, 1.0) during the first transmission wave by February 14, 2020, while the overall R based on the cluster size distribution as of March 17, 2020, was estimated at 0.6 (95% CI 0.4, 1.02). The overall mean reporting delay was estimated at 6.4 days (95% CI 5.8, 6.9), but it was shorter among imported cases compared to local cases (mean 4.3 vs. 7.6 days, Wilcoxon test, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The trajectory of the reproduction number in Singapore underscores the significant effects of successful containment efforts in Singapore, but it also suggests the need to sustain social distancing and active case finding efforts to stomp out all active chains of transmission.","Tariq, Amna; Lee, Yiseul; Roosa, Kimberlyn; Blumberg, Seth; Yan, Ping; Ma, Stefan; Chowell, Gerardo",BMC Med,79,1

METHODS: Medical charts of 3,694 of patients dying with COVID-19 in Italy were reviewed to extract information on demographics, preexisting comorbidities, and in-hospital complications leading to death. Multivariate logistic regressions were performed to assess the association of obesity with nonrespiratory complications. These analyses were adjusted for age, gender, and number of preexisting comorbidities. RESULTS: Obesity was present in 411/3,694 (11.1%) patients dying with COVID-19. Obesity was significantly associated with increased probability of experiencing acute renal failure (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.33; 95% CI: 1.04-1.71) and shock (adjusted OR, 1.54; 95% CI: 1.19-1.99). The associations of obesity with acute renal failure and shock were stronger in patients aged < 60 years (adjusted OR, 2.00; 95% CI: 1.09-3.67 and OR, 2.37; 95% CI 1.29-4.36) than in those aged 60 years or older (adjusted OR, 1.20; 95% CI: 0.90-1.60 and OR, 1.22; 95% CI: 0.91-1.65). CONCLUSIONS: In patients dying with COVID-19 in Italy, obesity is associated with an increased probability of nonrespiratory complications, particularly shock and acute renal failure. These associations seem stronger in younger than in older adults. Strategies should be put in place in patients with COVID-19 with obesity to prevent these complications.","Onder, Graziano; Palmieri, Luigi; Vanacore, Nicola; Giuliano, Marina; Brusaferro, Silvio",Obesity (Silver Spring),79,16

However, there are fewer scientific dissertations about the risk of recurrent positive. The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between SARS-COV-2 RNA positive duration (SPD) and the risk of recurrent positive. METHODS: This case-control multi-center study enrolled participants from 8 Chinese hospital including 411 participants (recurrent positive 241). Using unadjusted and multivariate-adjusted logistic regression analyses, generalized additive model with a smooth curve fitting, we evaluated the associations between SPD and risk of recurrent positive. Besides, subgroup analyses were performed to explore the potential interactions. RESULTS: Among recurrent positive patients, there were 121 females (50.2%), median age was 50 years old [interquartile range (IQR): 38-63]. In non-adjusted model and adjusted model, SPD was associated with an increased risk of recurrent positive (fully-adjusted model: OR = 1.05, 95% CI: 1.02-1.08, P = 0.001); the curve fitting was not significant (P = 0.286). Comparing with SPD < 14 days, the risk of recurrent positive in SPD > 28 days was risen substantially (OR = 3.09, 95% CI: 1.44-6.63, P = 0.004). Interaction and stratified analyses showed greater effect estimates of SPD and risk of recurrent positive in the hypertension, low monocyte count and percentage patients (P for interaction = 0.008, 0.002, 0.036, respectively). CONCLUSION: SPD was associated with a higher risk of recurrent positive and especially SPD > 28 day had a two-fold increase in the relative risk of re-positive as compared with SPD < 14 day. What's more, the risk may be higher among those with hypertension and lower monocyte count or percentage.","Zhao, Hong; Zhang, Chi; Chen, Xian-Xiang; Zhu, Qi; Huang, Wen-Xiang; Zeng, Yi-Lan; Liu, Ying-Xia; Li, Guo-Jun; Du, Wei-Jun; Yao, Jing; Li, Jia-Wen; Peng, Peng; Wang, Gui-Qiang",Infect Dis Poverty,79,1

COVID-19 and the history of frequent infectious outbreaks in the last two decades suggest that COVID-19 is likely a dry run for future ecological crises. Now is the right time to plan ahead and deploy the armamentarium of systems science scholarship for planetary health. The science of epigenomics, which investigates both genetic and nongenetic traits regarding heritable phenotypic alterations, and new approaches to understanding genome regulation in humans and pathogens offer veritable prospects to boost the global scientific capacities to innovate therapeutics and diagnostics against novel and existing infectious agents. Several reversible epigenetic alterations, such as chromatin remodeling and histone methylation, control and influence gene expression. COVID-19 lethality is linked, in part, to the cytokine storm, age, and status of the immune system in a given person. Additionally, due to reduced human mobility and daily activities, effects of the pandemic on the environment have been both positive and negative. For example, reduction in environmental pollution and lesser extraction from nature have potential positive corollaries on water and air quality. Negative effects include pollution as plastics and other materials were disposed in unconventional places and spaces in the course of the pandemic. I discuss the opportunities and challenges associated with the science of epigenomics, specifically with an eye to inform and prevent future ecological crises and pandemics that are looming on the horizon in the 21st century. In particular, this article underscores that epigenetics of both viruses and the host may influence virus infectivity and severity of attendant disease.","Dzobo, Kevin",OMICS,79,24

Believing in them without discrimination can cause great trouble to people’s life. However, universal language models may perform weakly in these fake news detection for lack of large-scale annotated data and sufficient semantic understanding of domain-specific knowledge. While the model trained on corresponding corpora is also mediocre for insufficient learning. In this paper, we propose a novel transformer-based language model fine-tuning approach for these fake news detection. First, the token vocabulary of individual model is expanded for the actual semantics of professional phrases. Second, we adapt the heated-up softmax loss to distinguish the hard-mining samples, which are common for fake news because of the disambiguation of short text. Then, we involve adversarial training to improve the model’s robustness. Last, the predicted features extracted by universal language model RoBERTa and domain-specific model CT-BERT are fused by one multiple layer perception to integrate fine-grained and high-level specific representations.

A study of physiological expressions of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) host cell entry-related factors in immune system components may help explain molecular mechanisms involved in COVID-19 immunopathology. We analyzed transcriptomic and proteomic expression metadata for SARS-CoV-2 host cell entry receptor ACE2 and entry associated proteases (TMPRSS2, CTSL, and FURIN) in silico across immune system components including the blood lineage cells.

We investigated key population level events on activity of the three hyperacute stroke units (HASUs) within Greater Manchester and East Cheshire (GM & EC), whilst adjusting for environmental factors. METHODS: Weekly stroke admission & discharge counts in the three HASUs were collected locally from Emergency Department (ED) data and Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme core dataset prior to, and during the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic (Jan 2020 to May 2020). Whilst adjusting for local traffic-related air pollution and ambient measurement, an interrupted time-series analysis using a segmented generalised linear model investigated key population level events on the rate of stroke team ED assessments, admissions for stroke, referrals for transient ischaemic attack (TIA), and stroke discharges. RESULTS: The median total number of ED stroke assessments, admissions, TIA referrals, and discharges across the three HASU sites prior to the first UK COVID-19 death were 150, 114, 69, and 76 per week. The stable weekly trend in ED assessments and stroke admissions decreased by approximately 16% (and 21% for TIAs) between first UK hospital COVID-19 death (5th March) and the implementation of the Act-FAST campaign (6th April) where a modest 4% and 5% increase per week was observed. TIA referrals increased post Government intervention (23rd March), without fully returning to the numbers observed in January and February. Trends in discharges from stroke units appeared unaffected within the study period reported here. CONCLUSION: Despite adjustment for environmental factors stroke activity was temporarily modified by the COVID-19 pandemic. Underlying motivations within the population are still not clear. This raises concerns that patients may have avoided urgent health care risking poorer short and long-term health outcomes.","Gittins, Matthew; Ashton, Christopher; Holden, Neil; Cross, Stephen; Meadipudi, Srinath; Kawafi, Khalil; Burger, Ilse; Rickard, Sarah; Vail, Andy; Molloy, Jane; Smith, Craig J",J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis,79,1

However, existing studies on depressive symptoms in Chinese university students during the COVID-19 pandemic reported a wide range of prevalence estimates, making mental health planning for this population difficult. The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of surveys that assessed the prevalence of depressive symptoms in Chinese university students amid the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Major Chinese (CNKI, Wanfang, VIP) and English (PubMed, Embase, PsycInfo) databases and preprint platforms were searched to identify cross-sectional studies containing data on the prevalence of depressive symptoms in Chinese university students during the pandemic. Two authors independently retrieved the literature, evaluated the eligibility of potential studies, assessed the risk of bias (RoB) of included studies, and extracted data. RoB was assessed with the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist for Studies Reporting Prevalence Data. RESULTS: In total, 1177 records were retrieved, and 84 studies involving 1 292 811 Chinese university students during the pandemic were included. None of the included studies were rated as completely low RoB. Statistically significant heterogeneity in the prevalence estimates of included studies was detected (I2 = 99.9%, p < 0.001). The pooled prevalence of depressive symptoms was 26.0% (95%CI: 23.3-28.9%), which was significantly higher in female than in male students (30.8% v. 28.6%, p < 0.001), in postgraduates than in undergraduates (29.3% v. 22.9%, p < 0.001), in students living inside than in those living outside the COVID-19 epicentre (27.5% v. 22.3%, P < 0.001), in students from universities at the epicentre than in those from universities outside the epicentre (26.2% v. 23.1%, p < 0.001), in students who had close contact with COVID-19 than in those who did not (46.0% v. 25.0%, p < 0.001), and in students who had acquaintances or relatives infected with COVID-19 (39.7% v. 24.0%, p < 0.001) than in those who did not. Five sources of heterogeneity were identified from the subgroup analysis: survey period, % of males among the survey sample, scale of depressive symptoms, cutoff score of the scale and level of RoB. CONCLUSIONS: Over one-fourth of Chinese university students experienced depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. Mental health services for this population should include periodic evaluation of depressive symptoms, expanded social support and psychiatric assessment and treatment when necessary. It is also necessary to design depression prevention programmes that target higher-risk cohorts of university students.","Luo, Wei; Zhong, Bao-Liang; Chiu, Helen Fung-Kum",Epidemiol Psychiatr Sci,79,1

A small percentage of cases persist with prolonged positive RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs. The aim of this study was to determine risk factors for prolonged viral shedding amongst patient's basal clinical conditions. METHODS: We have evaluated all 513 patients attended in our hospital between 1 March and 1 July. We have selected all 18 patients with prolonged viral shedding and compared them with 36 sex-matched randomly selected controls. Demographic, treatment and clinical data were systematically collected. RESULTS: Global median duration of viral clearance was 25.5 days (n = 54; IQR, 22-39.3 days), 48.5 days in cases (IQR 38.7-54.9 days) and 23 days in controls (IQR 20.2-25.7), respectively. There were not observed differences in demographic, symptoms or treatment data between groups. Chronic rhinosinusitis and atopy were more common in patients with prolonged viral shedding (67%) compared with controls (11% and 25% respectively) (P < 0.001 and P = 0.003). The use of inhaled corticosteroids was also more frequent in case group (P = 0.007). Multivariate analysis indicated that CRS (odds ratio [OR], 18.78; 95% confidence interval [95%CI], 3.89-90.59; P < 0.001) was independently associated with prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding in URT samples, after adjusting for initial PCR Ct values. CONCLUSION: We found that chronic rhinosinusitis and atopy might be associated with increased risk of prolonged viral shedding.

Globally, there is an urgent need to use safe and effective vaccines for immunization to achieve comprehensive protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Focusing on developing a rapid vaccine platform with significant immunogenicity as well as broad and high protection efficiency, we designed a SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) displayed on self-assembled ferritin nanoparticles. In a 293i cells eukaryotic expression system, this candidate vaccine was prepared and purified. After rhesus monkeys are immunized with 20 µg of RBD-ferritin nanoparticles three times, the vaccine can elicit specific humoral immunity and T cell immune response, and the neutralizing antibodies can cross-neutralize four SARS-CoV-2 strains from different sources. In the challenge protection test, after nasal infection with 2 × 105 CCID50 SARS-CoV-2 virus, compared with unimmunized control animals, virus replication in the vaccine-immunized rhesus monkeys was significantly inhibited, and respiratory pathology observations also showed only slight pathological damage. These analyses will benefit the immunization program of the RBD-ferritin nanoparticle vaccine in the clinical trial design and the platform construction to present a specific antigen domain in the self-assembling nanoparticle in a short time to harvest stable, safe, and effective vaccine candidates for new SARS-CoV-2 isolates.","Li, Heng; Guo, Lei; Zheng, Huiwen; Li, Jing; Zhao, Xin; Li, Jiaqi; Liang, Yan; Yang, Fengmei; Zhao, Yurong; Yang, Jinling; Xue, Mengyi; Zuo, Yuanyuan; Zhou, Jian; Chen, Yanli; Yang, Zening; Li, Yanyan; Jin, Weihua; Shi, Haijing; He, Zhanlong; Li, Qihan; Liu, Longding",Bioconjug Chem,79,20

METHODS: We retrospectively analysed 498 COVID-19 positive adult admissions to our institute from 7 March to 7 April 2020. Patient data were collected for baseline demographics, comorbidities and in-hospital outcomes, especially relating to cardiovascular intervention. RESULTS: Mean age was 67.4±16.1 years and 62.2% (n=310) were male. 64.1% (n=319) of our cohort had underlying cardiovascular disease (CVD) with 53.4% (n=266) having hypertension. 43.2%(n=215) developed acute myocardial injury. Mortality was significantly increased in those patients with myocardial injury (47.4% vs 18.4%, p<0.001).

However, interventions targeting loneliness are less common than interventions for other mental health problems, such as depression and anxiety, and existing interventions focus primarily on building social skills and increasing opportunities for social interaction despite research suggesting these techniques are not the most effective. Furthermore, although there is an increasing need for scalable and convenient interventions, digital interventions for loneliness are even less common. OBJECTIVE: Using a qualitative approach, we explore how adults (18-64 years of age) who express wanting to be more connected to others experience loneliness and react to a digital mental health intervention targeting loneliness. METHODS: A total of 11 participants were recruited from a pilot randomized controlled trial exploring the impact of a digital mental health intervention, Happify Health, on loneliness among adults aged 18-64 years who indicated wanting to feel more connected to others when signing up for the platform. Participants were invited to participate in a 3-day asynchronous focus group about their experiences with loneliness, with Happify Health, and with social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic. All 11 participants completed the focus group in May 2020. RESULTS: Participants' responses were coded using thematic analysis, which led to identifying five themes, each with separate subthemes, that could be applied across the 3-day focus group: loneliness, relationships, social distancing, skill acquisition, and coping. Overall, we observed variability across participants in terms of the source of their loneliness, their perceptions of their social connections, and their motivation to reduce feelings of loneliness; however, participants commonly referred to negative self-perceptions as a cause or consequence of loneliness. Participants also varied in the extent to which they felt social distancing increased or decreased feelings of loneliness. In regard to the intervention, participants showed evidence of adopting skills they used to address their loneliness, particularly mindfulness and gratitude, and then using these skills to shift toward more active coping strategies following the intervention, including during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: The heterogeneity in participants' experiences with loneliness described during this focus group emphasizes the subjective and complex nature of loneliness. This highlights the importance of developing loneliness interventions that use a variety of strategies, including both direct and indirect strategies for reducing loneliness. However, based on our data, a key component to loneliness interventions is incorporating strategies for addressing underlying negative self-perceptions that stem from, but also contribute to, loneliness. This data also provides preliminary evidence that digital platforms may be an effective tool for disseminating loneliness interventions while providing the added benefit of offering a productive distraction when feeling lonely.","Boucher, Eliane M; McNaughton, Emily C; Harake, Nicole; Stafford, Julia L; Parks, Acacia C",JMIR Ment Health,79,1

However, the above methods have a critical challenge: data privacy. GAN will leak the semantic information of the training data which can be used to reconstruct the training samples by attackers, thereby this method will leak the privacy of the patient. Furthermore, for this reason, that is the limitation of the training data sample, different hospitals jointly train the model through data sharing, which will also cause privacy leakage. To solve this problem, we adopt the Federated Learning (FL) framework, a new technique being used to protect data privacy. Under the FL framework and Differentially Private thinking, we propose a Federated Differentially Private Generative Adversarial Network (FedDPGAN) to detect COVID-19 pneumonia for sustainable smart cities. Specifically, we use DP-GAN to privately generate diverse patient data in which differential privacy technology is introduced to make sure the privacy protection of the semantic information of the training dataset. Furthermore, we leverage FL to allow hospitals to collaboratively train COVID-19 models without sharing the original data. Under Independent and Identically Distributed (IID) and non-IID settings, the evaluation of the proposed model is on three types of chest X-ray (CXR)images dataset (COVID-19, normal, and normal pneumonia).

Besides the p53-like tumor suppressive activities, p73 has unique roles, namely in neuronal development and differentiation. In addition, the TP73 gene is rarely mutated in tumors. This makes p73 a highly appealing therapeutic target, particularly towards cancers with a null or disrupted p53 pathway. Distinct isoforms are transcribed from the TP73 locus either with (TAp73) and without (&#916;Np73) the N-terminal transactivation domain. Conversely to TA tumor suppressors, &#916;N proteins exhibit oncogenic properties by inhibiting p53 and TA protein functions. As such, p73 isoforms compose a puzzled and challenging regulatory pathway.

The liver bioconcentrates more Al than the ovaries in the females from the Ctr and Ac groups. Aluminum and/or acidic pH did not alter ßfsh gene expression, while ßlh gene expression decreased in females from the Al group. Aluminum acted as an endocrine disruptor, suggesting deleterious effects in reproduction that could result in ovulation failure. Aluminum can act directly and/or indirectly in the pituitary, affecting ovarian steroidogenesis and altering the reproductive endocrine axis of mature O. niloticus females in an acute period of exposure.","de Moraes Narcizo, Amanda; Correia, Tiago Gabriel; Bianchini, Adalto; Mayer, Mário Gustavo; Zampieri, Ricardo Andrade; Floeter-Winter, Lucile Maria; Moreira, Renata Guimarães",Comp Biochem Physiol C Toxicol Pharmacol,79,29

False negative cases are increasingly reported in several studies using reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). For example, the positive rate of RT-PCR for throat swabs was reported to be about 60% in early stage of COVID-19. AIM: We aimed to present metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) as a potential tool to detect pathogens. METHODS: In the recent year, mNGS is shown the potential to detect pathogens without the need of hypothesis guided approach and is proven to be highly effective. RESULTS: A recent prospective study in the United States compared the diagnostic performance of routine diagnostic tests with mNGS and showed that mNGS detected a bacteria or virus in the CSF of 13 of 58 patients presenting with meningoencephalitis who were negative for or not assessed with routine diagnostic test including PCR. NGS also has the advantage to cover entire viral genomes. CONCLUSION: As viral metagenomics has significantly improved in recent years and become more cost effective, we think that a change in the approach toward a shot-gun metagenomic testing should be explored and could potentially aid the diagnosis of COVID-19 cases and the management of this pandemic.","Borroni, Davide; Gadhvi, Kunal",Open Access Maced.

The objective of this research is to quantify such excess deaths, partitioned by age group and gender. STUDY DESIGN: This is a data analysis. METHODS: Excess deaths by age and gender are estimated using provisional death data available from the Centers for disease control and prevention (CDC) over the time period from March 1, 2020 through May 30, 2020. Previous year fatality and population data are used as the benchmark. RESULTS: Several of the eighteen age and gender cohorts experienced statistically significant excess deaths. The results also indicate that COVID-19 has been protective for one of the age and gender cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: There have been more excess deaths in several age group and gender cohorts during the first three months of the pandemic, beyond direct deaths directly attributable to COVID-19. These non-COVID-19 excess deaths are most apparent in the 25- to 44-year age group for women and 15- to 54-year age group for men. Further research is needed to assess the cause of such excess deaths and introduce safeguards to reduce such deaths in the future.","Jacobson, S H; Jokela, J A",Public Health,79,1

DESIGN: Narrative review. SETTING: Non-institutionalized community-living people. PARTICIPANTS: 20.069 individuals from ten descriptive cross-sectional papers. MEASUREMENTS: Articles since 2019 to 2020 published on Pubmed, Scielo and Google Scholar databases with the following MeSh terms (‘COVID-19’, ‘coronavirus’, ‘aging’, ‘older people’, ‘elderly’, ‘social isolation’ and ‘quarantine’) in English, Spanish or Portuguese were included. The studies not including people over 60 were excluded. Guidelines, recommendations, and update documents from different international organizations related to mental and physical activity were also analysed. RESULTS: 41 documents have been included in this narrative review, involving a total of 20.069 individuals (58% women), from Asia, Europe and America. 31 articles included recommendations and 10 addressed the impact of social distancing on mental or physical health. The main outcomes reported were anxiety, depression, poor sleep quality and physical inactivity during the isolation period. Cognitive strategies and increasing physical activity levels using apps, online videos, telehealth, are the main international recommendations. CONCLUSION: Mental and physical health in older people are negatively affected during the social distancing for COVID-19. Therefore, a multicomponent program with exercise and psychological strategies are highly recommended for this population during the confinement. Future investigations are necessary in this field.","Sepúlveda-Loyola, W.; Rodríguez-Sánchez, I.; Pérez-Rodríguez, P.; Ganz, F.; Torralba, R.; Oliveira, D.

Its pathophysiology is still a major challenge for science. It is known that angiotensin II (Ang-II) binds AT1 receptor (AT1R) and its overactivation induces fibrosis, inflammation and oxidative stress. In contrast, activation of the Mas receptor (Mas-R) by angiotensin 1-7 opposes the harmful effects induced by Ang-II. Thus, our innovative objective was to analyze, in patients' lung with IPF, the balance between AT1R and Mas-R expression and their possible association with pulmonary spirometric parameters: forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1%) and forced vital capacity (FVC%). One cubic centimeter of lung tissue was obtained from IPF patients (n = 6) and from patients without IPF (n = 6) who underwent bronchial carcinoma resection. Receptor expression was quantified using western blot. AT1R expression was significantly higher (34 %) in patients with IPF (P = 0.006), whereas Mas-R was significantly less expressed (54 %) in these patients' lungs (P = 0.046). There was also a positive correlation between Mas-R expression and FEV1% (r = 0.62, P = 0.03) and FVC% (r = 0.58, P = 0.05). Conversely, AT1R expression was negatively correlated with FEV1% (r = 0.80, P = 0.002) and FVC% (r = 0.74, P = 0.006). In conclusion, our results demonstrated an increased expression of AT1R and reduced expression of Mas-R in the lung of patients with IPF. The dominance of AT1R expression is associated with reduced lung function, highlighting the role of the renin-angiotensin system peptides in the pathophysiology of IPF.","Raupp, Débora; Fernandes, Renata Streck; Antunes, Krist Helen; Perin, Fabíola Adélia; Rigatto, Katya",Peptides,79,26

Subsequent cytotoxicity screening revealed it to be a 2.97 µM cell growth inhibitor of the MiaPaCa-2 pancreatic cell line. This is in keeping with our hypothesis that inhibiting this interaction would have an anti-pancreatic cancer effect with S100A2, the validated PC drug target. A combination of focused library synthesis (3 libraries, 24 compounds total) and cytotoxicity screening identified a propyl alkyl diamine spacer as optimal; the nature of the terminal phenyl substituent had limited impact on observed cytotoxicity, whereas N -methylation was detrimental to activity. In total 15 human cancer cell lines were examined, with most analogues showing broad spectrum activity. Near uniform activity was observed against a panel of six pancreatic cancer cell lines: MiaPaCa-2, BxPC-3, AsPC-1, Capan-2, HPAC and PANC-1. In all cases there was good to excellent correlation between the predicted docking pose in the S100A2-p53 binding groove and the observed cytotoxicity, especially in the pancreatic cancer cell line with high endogenous S100A2 expression. This supports S100A2 as a pancreatic cancer drug target.","Sun, Jufeng; Ambrus, Joey I; Russell, Cecilia C; Baker, Jennifer R; Cossar, Peter J; Pirinen, Melanie J; Sakoff, Jennette A; Scarlett, Christopher J; McCluskey, Adam",ChemMedChem (Internet),79,32

First, using human brain organoids, we observed clear evidence of infection with accompanying metabolic changes in infected and neighboring neurons. However, no evidence for type I interferon responses was detected. We demonstrate that neuronal infection can be prevented by blocking ACE2 with antibodies or by administering cerebrospinal fluid from a COVID-19 patient. Second, using mice overexpressing human ACE2, we demonstrate SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion in vivo. Finally, in autopsies from patients who died of COVID-19, we detect SARS-CoV-2 in cortical neurons and note pathological features associated with infection with minimal immune cell infiltrates.

However, used inappropriately, oxygen therapy can result in adverse consequences, including progressive respiratory failure and death. AIM: To investigate the effectiveness of a targeted intervention to improve prescribing practice and therapeutic application of supplemental oxygen. METHODS: Respiratory, Oncology and Surgery wards were targeted for the intervention. Nursing and junior medical staff from these wards undertook an education programme about safe use of oxygen. Cross-sectional data about oxygen prescribing, administration and monitoring were collected on inpatients in these wards at baseline, and at 3 and 6 months post-intervention, using a modified version of the British Thoracic Society Oxygen Audit Tool. RESULTS: At baseline, there was a written prescription for oxygen in 56% of patients (n = 43) using oxygen and this increased to 75% (n = 44) at 3 months, and remained at 65% (n = 48) at 6 months.

Concerns limiting lung transplantation include recurrence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the allograft, technical challenges imposed by viral-mediated injury to the native lung, and the potential risk for allograft infection by pathogens causing ventilator-associated pneumonia in the native lung. Importantly, the native lung might recover, resulting in long-term outcomes preferable to those of transplant. Here, we report the results of lung transplantation in three patients with non-resolving COVID-19-associated respiratory failure. We performed single molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization (smFISH) to detect both positive and negative strands of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in explanted lung tissue from the three patients and in additional control lung tissue samples. We conducted extracellular matrix imaging and single cell RNA sequencing on explanted lung tissue from the three patients who underwent transplantation and on warm post-mortem lung biopsies from two patients who had died from COVID-19-associated pneumonia. Lungs from these five patients with prolonged COVID-19 disease were free of SARS-CoV-2 as detected by smFISH, but pathology showed extensive evidence of injury and fibrosis that resembled end-stage pulmonary fibrosis. Using machine learning, we compared single cell RNA sequencing data from the lungs of patients with late stage COVID-19 to that from the lungs of patients with pulmonary fibrosis and identified similarities in gene expression across cell lineages.

The preoperative data, including baseline information of the patients, radiographic parameters, and type of surgical procedure, were collected from the hospital database, and postoperative data, including complications, were collected during the follow-up visit.In all, 33 patients (average, 8.0â±â2.1 years, male 20, female 13) in the ESIN group and 38 patients (average, 8.3â±â2.3 years, male 23, female 15) in the ExFix group were included in this study. There was significantly less operative time for the ExFix group (45.4â±â7.8âmin) as compared to the ESIN group (57.8â±â11.3âmin) (Pâ<â.01), reduced estimated blood loss (EBL) in the ExFix group (9.9â±â3.5) as compared to the ESIN group (16.4â±â6.5) (Pâ<â.01). As for the frequency of fluoroscopy, there was a significant difference between the ExFix group (13.9â±â2.4) and the ESIN group (15.5â±â3.2) (Pâ=â.02). The rate of major complications was not significantly different between the 2 groups (Pâ=â.19). The rate of implant irritation was significantly higher in the ExFix group (28/38, 73.7%) than the ESIN group (12/33, 36.4%) (Pâ<â.01). The rate of surgical site infection (SSI) is significantly higher in the ExFix group (18/38, 47.4%)) than the ESIN group (1/33, 3%) (Pâ<â.01). The rate of scar concern was significantly higher in the ExFix (9/38, 23.7%) than the ESIN (2/33, 6.1%), (Pâ=â.04). According to the Flynn scoring system, 30(90.9%) patients in the ESIN group and 24(89.5%) patients in the ExFix group were rated as excellent. None of the patients had poor outcomes.Both ESIN and ExFix produced satisfactory outcomes in distal third femoral shaft fractures. ExFix remains a viable choice for selected cases, especially in resource-challenged and austere settings.","Li, Jin; Rai, Saroj; Ze, Renhao; Tang, Xin; Liu, Ruikang; Hong, Pan",Medicine (Baltimore),79,32

Recently there has been an acceleration in the development of candidate RSV vaccines, monoclonal antibodies and therapeutics. However, the effects of RSV genomic variability on the implementation of vaccines and therapeutics remain poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the Fogarty International Center held a workshop to summarize what is known about the global burden and transmission of RSV disease, the phylogeographic dynamics and genomics of the virus, and the networks that exist to improve the understanding of RSV disease. Discussion at the workshop focused on the implications of viral evolution and genomic variability for vaccine and therapeutics development in the context of various immunization strategies. This paper summarizes the meeting, highlights research gaps and future priorities, and outlines what has been achieved since the meeting took place. It concludes with an examination of what the RSV community can learn from our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 genomics and what insights over sixty years of RSV research can offer the rapidly evolving field of COVID-19 vaccines.","Kim, Sonnie; Williams, Thomas C; Viboud, Cecile; Campbell, Harry; Chen, Jiani; Spiro, David J",Vaccine,79,16

In the present study, we investigated the association between human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I, which plays a major role in susceptibility to viral infections, and the mortality of COVID-19. METHODS: data of allele frequencies of HLA-A, -B and -C and COVID-19 mortality were obtained for 74 countries from the Allele Frequency Net Database and worldometer.info. Association between allele frequency of each HLA and mortality was assessed by linear regression followed by multivariable regression. Subsequently, association of HLA-C*05 to its receptor KIR2DS4fl, expressed on natural killer (NK) cells, and differential mortality to historic pandemics were analyzed. RESULTS: HLA-A*01, -B*07, -B*08, -B*44 and -C*05 were significantly associated with the risk of deaths (adjusted p = 0.040, 0.00081, 0.047, 0.0022, 0.00032, respectively), but only HLA-C*05 remained statistically significant (p = 0.000027) after multivariable regression. A 1% increase in the allele frequency of HLA-C*05 was associated with an increase of 44 deaths/million. Countries with different mortality could be categorized by the distribution of HLA-C*05 and its receptor KIR2DS4fl, which in combination cause NK cell-induced hyperactive immune response. Countries with similar ethnic and/or geographic background responded in a similar pattern to each pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: we demonstrated that allele frequency of HLA-C*05 and the distribution pattern with its receptor KIR2DS4fl strongly correlated with COVID-19 mortality. Host genetic variance of innate immunity may contribute to the difference in mortality among various countries and further investigation using patient samples is warranted.","Sakuraba, Atsushi; Haider, Haider; Sato, Toshiro",Viruses,79,27

Infections and quarantine measures have prevented the regular flow of certain goods and of connected services. Cases of shortages and/or surpluses, a lack of the availability of labor, and a reduction in demand for some food products and flowers have occurred. New food production approaches have emerged and a reconnection between farmers and consumers has been spreading, thereby facilitating product distribution. Moreover, during the forced isolation, people have had to face periods of stress. The benefits that can be derived from leisure activities related to flowers and ornamental plants, and from access to nature and urban green spaces are increasingly being recognized as relevant.

Reducing interactions between people by social distancing is an effective and prevalent measure to reduce the risk of infection and spread of the virus within a community. Current developments in several countries show that this measure can be technologically accompanied by mobile apps; meanwhile, privacy concerns are being intensively discussed. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine central cognitive variables that may constitute people's motivations for social distancing, using an app, and providing health-related data requested by two apps that differ in their direct utility for the individual user. The results may increase our understanding of people's concerns and convictions, which can then be specifically addressed by public-oriented communication strategies and appropriate political decisions. METHODS: This study refers to the protection motivation theory, which is adaptable to both health-related and technology-related motivations. The concept of social trust was added. The quantitative survey included answers from 406 German-speaking participants who provided assessments of data security issues, trust components, and the processes of threat and coping appraisal related to the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection by social distancing. With respect to apps, one central focus was on the difference between a contact tracing app and a data donation app. RESULTS: Multiple regression analyses showed that the present model could explain 55% of the interindividual variance in the participants' motivation for social distancing, 46% for using a contact tracing app, 42% for providing their own infection status to a contact tracing app, and 34% for using a data donation app. Several cognitive components of threat and coping appraisal were related to motivation measurements. Trust in other people's social distancing behavior and general trust in official app providers also played important roles; however, the participants' age and gender did not. Motivations for using and accepting a contact tracing app were higher than those for using and accepting a data donation app. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed some important cognitive factors that constitute people's motivation for social distancing and using apps to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Concrete implications for future research, public-oriented communication strategies, and appropriate political decisions were identified and are discussed.","Kaspar, Kai",J Med Internet Res,79,16

Social media may be a useful adjunct for laparoscopic training, but its utility in developing countries like India has not been studied carefully. This paper describes an observational, cross-sectional study on the educational utility of Facebook groups based in India and which focus on laparoscopic gynecologic surgery. Methods: The most popular Facebook groups involving Indians and focusing on laparoscopic gynecology were identified using appropriate search terms as well as inclusion and exclusion criteria. Demographic data related to the groups, the authors of posts as well as descriptive statistics of all the posts during the study period were collected and appropriate statistical analysis was performed. Results: All the groups in this study were large and growing steadily. Posts related to laparoscopy were more likely to be videos, dealing with operative techniques and having educational value for postgraduate residents (p value &lt; 0.001) compared to posts unrelated to laparoscopic surgery. The majority of posts (88.2%) presented original content created by group members rather than material shared from other sources. Members preferred to share laparoscopic content using links to their personal YouTube channels rather than using institutional YouTube channels, dedicated websites for laparoscopic surgery or direct posts on Facebook. Group members liked educational content and laparoscopic surgery-related content significantly more than other content. Only 16.7% of the laparoscopic surgeons could be identified to be working in academic institutes. Conclusion: Social media for medical education has inherent advantages and disadvantages. This article provides objective data regarding its utilisation in a developing country in the midst of the Covid pandemic, and provides a guide for further research and development of innovative teaching methods.","Rajan, Deepa Pillai Vinod G.; Varghese, Patsy",Advances in Medical Education and Practice,79,16

Current research posits that younger adults without persisting health conditions may be at reduced risk for complications of COVID-19 infection. However, young adults are often in unstable places in their careers, education, and social lives, which may be more disrupted by policy changes than those of older adults. Thus, it is imperative to identify young adult subgroups who are at increased risk for mental health difficulties to develop targeted interventions to mitigate emotional distress. This study recruited 620 young adults, Ages 18-35 (M = 26.59; SD = 5.24), to determine whether there were differences in self-reported anxiety and depression in the weeks following the pandemic declaration by gender (male, female, or nonbinary) and health status (i.e., the absence of health conditions, the presence of either physical or mental health conditions, and the presence of both physical and mental health conditions) using a 3 × 4 analysis of variance. For both depression and anxiety, nonbinary participants reported the highest levels, followed by female participants. For health status, those with both mental and physical health conditions reported the highest anxiety and depression, followed by those with mental health conditions, physical health conditions, and no health conditions. These findings call for resources to be directed toward individuals who fall into groups reporting greater emotional distress, so that clinicians can intervene as early as possible to prevent mental health decline.

How to proceed?,13.6576395,9.986589,2020,"BACKGROUND: In these trying times, we developed an R package about bibliographic references on coronaviruses. Working with reproducible research principles based on open science, disseminating scientific information, providing easy access to scientific production on this particular issue, and offering a rapid integration in researchers' workflows may help save time in this race against the virus, notably in terms of public health. OBJECTIVE: The goal is to simplify the workflow of interested researchers, with multidisciplinary research in mind. With more than 60,500 medical bibliographic references at the time of publication, this package is among the largest about coronaviruses. METHODS: This package could be of interest to epidemiologists, researchers in scientometrics, biostatisticians, as well as data scientists broadly defined. This package collects references from PubMed and organizes the data in a data frame. We then built functions to sort through this collection of references. Researchers can also integrate the data into their pipeline and implement them in R within their code libraries. RESULTS: We provide a short use case in this paper based on a bibliometric analysis of the references made available by this package. Classification techniques can also be used to go through the large volume of references and allow researchers to save time on this part of their research. Network analysis can be used to filter the data set. Text mining techniques can also help researchers calculate similarity indices and help them focus on the parts of the literature that are relevant for their research. CONCLUSIONS: This package aims at accelerating research on coronaviruses. Epidemiologists can integrate this package into their workflow. It is also possible to add a machine learning layer on top of this package to model the latest advances in research about coronaviruses, as we update this package daily. It is also the only one of this size, to the best of our knowledge, to be built in the R language.","Warin, Thierry",J Med Internet Res,79,32

Due to the dynamic development of infections and the time lag between when patients are infected and when a proportion of them enters an intensive care unit (ICU), the need for future intensive care can easily be underestimated. To infer future ICU load from reported infections, we suggest a simple statistical model that (1) accounts for time lags and (2) allows for making predictions depending on different future growth of infections. We have evaluated our model for three heavily affected regions in Europe, namely Berlin (Germany), Lombardy (Italy), and Madrid (Spain). Before extensive containment measures made an impact, we first estimate the region-specific model parameters, namely ICU rate, time lag between infection, and ICU admission as well as length of stay in ICU. Whereas for Berlin, an ICU rate of 6%, a time lag of 6 days, and a stay of 12 days in ICU provide the best fit of the data, for Lombardy and Madrid the ICU rate was higher (18% and 15%) and the time lag (0 and 3 days) and the stay in ICU (3 and 8 days) shorter. The region-specific models are then used to predict future ICU load assuming either a continued exponential phase with varying growth rates (0-15%) or linear growth. By keeping the growth rates flexible, this model allows for taking into account the potential effect of diverse containment measures. Thus, the model can help to predict a potential exceedance of ICU capacity depending on future growth. A sensitivity analysis for an extended time period shows that the proposed model is particularly useful for exponential phases of the disease.","Ritter, Matthias; Ott, Derek V M; Paul, Friedemann; Haynes, John-Dylan; Ritter, Kerstin",Sci Rep,79,25

These principles are: (a) respect for autonomy; (b) doing well (beneficence); (c) not harming (non-maleficence); and (d) justice. In many countries, the global outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 has led to overloaded healthcare systems due to large numbers of COVID-19 patients. In order to provide care to this high volume of patients, far-reaching measures are taken that affect everyone. These measures are not taken from an individual patient's perspective but in the interest of public health; nonetheless, they can directly affect the individual patient's interests.

Communication strategies disseminate information among the population that such masks are essential for mitigating virus diffusion. However, scientific studies are not conclusive in showing the undisputed filtration efficiency of fabric/cloth facial masks (both commercial and homemade). OBJECTIVES: This study examines scientific data about the effectiveness of face masks before and during the COVID-19 emergency. Present trends in the making of commercial and homemade fabric/cloth face masks are also examined. METHODS: Statistical data of published studies are analyzed and compared. Main considerations and suggestions are also extracted and discussed. Current approaches are examined for assessing the characteristics and effectiveness of fabric/cloth commercial and homemade face masks intended for the population. RESULT: Conflicting data exist as to whether non-medical masks have a protective effect from the spread of respiratory viruses. Both medical masks (MDs) and respiratory personal protection equipment (PPE) show a given effectiveness value. CONCLUSION: Concerning commercial and homemade fabric/cloth masks, giving general indications on the choice of materials and their assemblage is difficult as it is not possible to assess the effectiveness of the filter media with respect to the kind of multiphase fluid that may be emitted upon breathing, sneezing, or coughing under different environmental conditions. This is particularly important because airflow rate, temperature, humidity, and duration of use will affect the performance of filter media. Moreover, while a mask may have excellent filter media, droplets may leak into the face-piece unless there is an adequate facial seal. In the presence of leaks, any type of mask may actually offer less protection independently of its nominal filtering effìciency.","Santarsiero, A; Giustini, M; Quadrini, F; D039,; Alessandro, D; Fara, G M",Ann Ig,79,16

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic not only had an adverse impact on specialist training, but also impacted the ability of trainees to undertake the final examinations in order to qualify as ENT specialists. RECENT FINDINGS: The response to the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the postponement of the final examination of the Fellowship of the College of Otorhinolaryngologists of South Africa (FCORL (SA)). A virtual clinical examination was held via videoconferencing to assess clinical judgement, insight, reasoning and decision making. SUMMARY: The virtual clinical assessment allowed trainees to undertake the final examination despite the COVID-19 pandemic, ensuring that they could be added to the limited number of specialists in South Africa and the African continent.","Seedat, Riaz Y",Curr Opin Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,79,16

Since this pandemic began, there have been numerous reports about the COVID-19 involvement of the nervous system. There have been reports of both direct and indirect involvement of the central and peripheral nervous system by the virus. OBJECTIVE: To review the neuropsychiatric manifestations along with corresponding pathophysiologic mechanisms of nervous system involvement by the COVID-19. BACKGROUND: Since the beginning of the disease in humans in the later part of 2019, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has rapidly spread across the world with over 2,719,000 reported cases in over 200 countries [World Health Organization. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) situation report-96.,]. While patients typically present with fever, shortness of breath, sore throat, and cough, neurologic manifestations have been reported, as well. These include the ones with both direct and indirect involvement of the nervous system. The reported manifestations include anosmia, ageusia, central respiratory failure, stroke, acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP), acute necrotizing hemorrhagic encephalopathy, toxic-metabolic encephalopathy, headache, myalgia, myelitis, ataxia, and various neuropsychiatric manifestations. These data were derived from the published clinical data in various journals and case reports. CONCLUSION: The neurological manifestations of the COVID-19 are varied and the data about this continue to evolve as the pandemic continues to progress.","Jasti, Madhu; Nalleballe, Krishna; Dandu, Vasuki; Onteddu, Sanjeeva",J. neurol,79,24

DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: Data were drawn from interviews with 327 individuals incarcerated after March 16, 2020, in Midwest1, Midwest2 and Southeast state using a questionnaire developed for this purpose. All study participants were actively involved in a randomized controlled trial of a behavioral health reentry intervention and the human subjects board approved the supplement of this study on COVID-19; interviews were conducted from April 15 to November 19, 2020. FINDINGS: Overall, 9.89% of participants contracted COVID-19. Most (68.50%) individuals learned about COVID-19 from television compared to official correctional facility announcements (32.42%). Participants wore face masks (85.02%), washed hands (84.40%) and practiced physical distancing when possible (66.36%). Participants reported that facilities suspended visitation (89.60%) and volunteers (82.57%), provided face masks (83.18%), sanitized (68.20%), conducted temperature checks (55.35%) and released individuals early (7.34%). SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS: Longitudinal observational study on the implementation and effectiveness of public health guidelines in prisons and jails may identify best practices for containing the infectious disease. Maximizing transparent communications, as well as COVID-19 prevention and mitigation efforts, are critical to achieving universal best practices for virus containment and amplifying public health. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: Data presented indicate the early adoption of many Centers for Disease Control guidelines by individuals and correctional facilities, although broad variation existed. Data support the identification of containment strategies for feasible implementation in a range of correctional spaces.","Pettus-Davis, Carrie; Kennedy, Stephanie C; Veeh, Christopher A",International journal of prisoner health (Online),79,24

Two community-based programs were implemented to evaluate the SARS-CoV-2 prevalence and investigate if the prevalence changes were significant across various occupations before and one month after lockdown. METHODS: Following consent, sociodemographic, clinical, and job-related information were recorded. The VivaDiag&#8482; SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Rapid Test was used. Positive results confirmed by a real-time Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction for SARS-COV-2. RESULTS: Positive participants were more likely to work in the catering/food sector than negative participants before the lockdown. Lockdown restrictions halved the new cases. No significant differences in the likelihood of being SARS-CoV-2 positive for different job categories were detected during lockdown. The presence of respiratory symptoms was an independent predictor for rapid antigen test positivity; however, one-third of newly diagnosed patients were asymptomatic at both time points. CONCLUSIONS: The catering/food sector was the most vulnerable to COVID-19 at the pre-lockdown evaluation. We highlight the crucial role of community-based screening with rapid antigen testing to evaluate the potential modes of community transmission and the impact of infection control strategies.","Kotsiou, Ourania S; Pantazopoulos, Ioannis; Papagiannis, Dimitrios; Fradelos, Evangelos C; Kanellopoulos, Nikolaos; Siachpazidou, Dimitra; Kirgou, Paraskevi; Mouliou, Dimitra S; Kyritsis, Athanasios; Kalantzis, Georgios; Saharidis, Georgios K D; Tzounis, Efthymios; Gourgoulianis, Konstantinos I",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),79,20

Viscoelastic testing may identify and characterise hypercoagulable states which are not apparent using conventional coagulation assays. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to undertake viscoelastic evaluation of the coagulation state in critically ill adults with COVID-19-associated respiratory failure METHODS: This was a single-centre observational point prevalence cohort study of adults with COVID-19-associated respiratory failure requiring respiratory support in the intensive care unit. Coagulation status was evaluated using rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM®) in conjunction with laboratory markers of coagulation. RESULTS: Six patients fulfilled inclusion criteria. Each patient had one ROTEM® performed. All patients had supranormal clot amplitude at 10 min (A10) and supranormal clot firmness (maximal clot firmness) measured in at least one ROTEM® pathway, and five were supranormal on all pathways. Minimal clot lysis was present on all analyses. Fibrinogen and D-dimer were elevated and routine markers of coagulation within normal ranges in all patients. CONCLUSION: Patients with COVID-19-associated respiratory failure admitted to the intensive care unit exhibit a hypercoagulable state which is not appreciable on conventional tests of coagulation. Supranormal clot firmness, minimal fibrinolysis, and hyperfibrinogenaemia are key findings. Further research is required into the pathophysiology of this hypercoagulable state, as well as the harms and benefits of different anticoagulation strategies.","Collett, Luke Wallace; Gluck, Samuel; Strickland, Richard Michael; Reddi, Benjamin John",Aust. crit. care,79,30

Secondarily, the report highlights the importance of assessing cognitive and emotional health in patients with post-COVID syndrome. METHODS (CASE DESCRIPTION): A 37-year-old woman tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and developed mild COVID-19 disease but did not require supplemental oxygen or hospitalization. The patient experienced persistent symptoms, including dyspnea, headaches, and cognitive fog. On day 62, they participated in an outpatient physical therapist evaluation that revealed deficits in exercise capacity, obtaining 50% of their age-predicted 6-minute walk distance. They had minor reductions in muscle strength and cognitive function. Self-reported quality of life was 50, and they scored above established cut-off scores for provisional diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). RESULTS: The patient participated in biweekly physical therapist sessions for 8 weeks, which included aerobic training, strengthening exercises, diaphragmatic breathing techniques, and mindfulness training. Metabolic equivalent for task levels increased with variability over the course of the program. The patient's muscle strength, physical function, and exercise capacity improved. 6-Minute walk distance increased by 199 m, equating to 80% of their age-predicted distance. Quality of life and PTSD scores did not improve. At evaluation after physical therapy, the patient was still experiencing migraines, dyspnea, fatigue, and cognitive dysfunction. CONCLUSION: This case report described the clinical presentation and physical therapist management of a person with post-COVID syndrome, a novel health condition for which little evidence exists to guide rehabilitation examination and interventions. Physical therapists should consider cognitive function and emotional health in their plan of care for patients with post-COVID syndromes. IMPACT: This case alerts physical therapists to post-COVID syndrome-which can include debilitating symptoms of decreased aerobic tolerance, anxiety, PTSD, and cognitive dysfunction-and to the role that therapists can play in assessing these symptoms and managing these patients.","Mayer, Kirby P; Steele, Angela K; Soper, Melissa K; Branton, Jill D; Lusby, Megan L; Kalema, Anna G; Dupont-Versteegden, Esther E; Montgomery-Yates, Ashley A",Phys. ther,79,5

The necessity to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and keep health care systems efficient resulted in the forced, drastic limitation of economic activity. Many service sectors were hit particularly hard with this but industry and agriculture were also affected. In particular, the pandemic substantially influenced financial markets and we can observe that some markets or instruments vary in stability since they have been affected in the different degree. In the paper, we present the problem of stability of stock markets during the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the low number of works related to CEE countries during the pandemic, we analyze the Warsaw Stock Exchange, which is one of the most important markets in the CEE. Our main goal was to find how various industries represented by stock market indices have reacted to the COVID-19 shock and consequently which sectors turned out to keep stability and remained resistant to the pandemic. In our investigation, we use two clustering methods: the K-means and the Ward techniques with the criterion of maximizing the silhouette coefficient and six indicators describing stability in terms of profitability, volume, overbought/oversold conditions and volatility. The results of the research present that during the pandemic it was possible to identify 5 clusters of sector indices in the short term and 4 in the medium term. We found that the composition of the clusters is quite stable over time and that none of the obtained clusters can be univocally considered the most or the least stable taking into account all the analyzed indicators. However, we showed that the obtained clusters have different stability origins, i.e. they vary from each other in terms of the investigated indicators of stability.","Buszko, Michal; Orzeszko, Witold; Stawarz, Marcin",PLoS One,79,24

Low level laser therapy (LLLT) has significant anti-inflammatory effects and reduces inflammatory cytokines. It is noninvasive and approved for pain management and musculoskeletal injuries. Data from human and experimental animal models of respiratory tract disease suggests that LLLT reduces inflammation and promotes lung healing. Case and outcomes: A morbidly obese 32-year-old Asian female with severe COVID-19 received four consecutive once-daily LLLT sessions via a laser scanner. Pulsed 808 nm and 905 nm laser beams were delivered over the posterior chest for 28 min. The patient was evaluated before and after LLLT by radiological assessment of lung edema (RALE) on chest X-ray, oxygen requirements and saturation, pneumonia severity indices (SMART-COP and Brescia-COVID), blood inflammatory markers (interleukin-6, ferritin, and C-Reactive protein (CRP)). Prior to treatment, oxygen saturation (SpO2) via pulse oximetry was 88%-93% on 5-6 L oxygen. Following LLLT, SpO2 increased to 97%-99% on 1-3 L oxygen. Reductions in RALE score from 8 to 3, Brescia-COVID from 4 to 0, and SMART-COP from 5 to 0 were observed. Interleukin-6 decreased from 45.89 to 11.7 pg/mL, ferritin from 359 to 175 ng/mL, and CRP from 3.04 to 1.43 mg/dL. Post-treatment, the patient noted appreciable improvement in respiratory symptoms. Conclusion: Following LLLT our patient showed improvement over a few days in respiratory indices, radiological findings, inflammatory markers, and patient outcomes. This report suggests that adjunct LLLT can be safely combined with conventional treatment in patients with severe COVID-19 and morbid obesity.","Sigman, Scott A; Mokmeli, Soheila; Vetrici, Mariana A",Can J Respir Ther,79,29

Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of canakinumab, an anti-interleukin-1ß antibody, in patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial was conducted at 39 hospitals in Europe and the United States. A total of 454 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, hypoxia (not requiring invasive mechanical ventilation [IMV]), and systemic hyperinflammation defined by increased blood concentrations of C-reactive protein or ferritin were enrolled between April 30 and August 17, 2020, with the last assessment of the primary end point on September 22, 2020. Intervention: Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive a single intravenous infusion of canakinumab (450 mg for body weight of 40-<60 kg, 600 mg for 60-80 kg, and 750 mg for >80 kg; n = 227) or placebo (n = 227). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was survival without IMV from day 3 to day 29. Secondary outcomes were COVID-19-related mortality, measurements of biomarkers of systemic hyperinflammation, and safety evaluations. Results: Among 454 patients who were randomized (median age, 59 years; 187 women [41.2%]), 417 (91.9%) completed day 29 of the trial. Between days 3 and 29, 198 of 223 patients (88.8%) survived without requiring IMV in the canakinumab group and 191 of 223 (85.7%) in the placebo group, with a rate difference of 3.1% (95% CI, -3.1% to 9.3%) and an odds ratio of 1.39 (95% CI, 0.76 to 2.54; P = .29). COVID-19-related mortality occurred in 11 of 223 patients (4.9%) in the canakinumab group vs 16 of 222 (7.2%) in the placebo group, with a rate difference of -2.3% (95% CI, -6.7% to 2.2%) and an odds ratio of 0.67 (95% CI, 0.30 to 1.50). Serious adverse events were observed in 36 of 225 patients (16%) treated with canakinumab vs 46 of 223 (20.6%) who received placebo. Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19, treatment with canakinumab, compared with placebo, did not significantly increase the likelihood of survival without IMV at day 29.

Due to limitations in testing coverage, the true extent of the spread may not be fully reflected in the reported cases. In this study, we obtain time-varying estimates of the fraction of COVID-19 infections reported in the different states. METHODS: Following a methodology developed in prior work, we use a delay-adjusted case fatality ratio to estimate the true fraction of cases reported in different states. We also develop a delay adjusted test positivity estimation method and study the relationship between the estimated test positivity rate for each state and the estimated fraction of cases reported. SETTING: We apply this method of analysis to all Indian states reporting at least 100 deaths as of 10 October 2020. RESULTS: Our analysis suggests that delay-adjusted case fatality ratios observed in different states range from 0.47% to 3.55%. The estimated fraction of cases reported in different states ranges from 39% to 100% for an assumed baseline case fatality ratio of 1.38%, from 18.6% to 100% for an assumed baseline case fatality ratio of 0.66%, and from 2.8% to 19.7% for an assumed baseline case fatality ratio of 0.1%. We also demonstrate a statistically significant negative relationship between the fraction of cases reported in each state and the testing positivity rate. CONCLUSIONS: The estimates provide a means to quantify and compare the trends of reporting and the true level of current infections in different states. This information may be used to guide policies for prioritising testing in different states, and also to analyse the time-varying effects of different quarantine measures adopted in different states.","Unnikrishnan, Jayakrishnan; Mangalathu, Sujith; Kutty, Raman V",BMJ Open,79,20

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new respiratory infectious disease and the relationship between COVID-19 and ABO blood group system needs to be explored urgently. Methods: A hospital-based case-control study was conducted at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University from 1 January 2020 to 5 March 2020. A total of 105 COVID-19 cases and 103 controls were included. The blood group frequency was tested with the chi-square statistic, and odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated between cases and controls. In addition, according to gender, the studied population was divided into two subgroups, and we assessed the association between cases and controls by gender. Finally, considering lymphopenia as a feature of COVID-19, the relationship between the ABO blood group and the lymphocyte count was determined in case samples. Results: The frequencies of blood types A, B, AB, and O were 42.8, 26.7, 8.57, and 21.9%, respectively, in the case group. Association analysis between the ABO blood group and COVID-19 indicated that there was a statistically significant difference for blood type A (P = 0.04, OR = 1.33, 95% CI = 1.02-1.73) but not for blood types B, AB or O (P = 0.48, OR = 0.90, 95% CI = 0.66-1.23; P = 0.61, OR = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.53-1.46; and P = 0.23, OR = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.58-1.15, respectively).

We studied the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 on a group and individual level in intubated ICU patients. METHODS: In a cohort of 86 patients, we analysed SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR results on nasopharyngeal and sputum samples (obtained as part of clinical care twice a week) according to time after intubation. Subsequently, we performed survival analyses. RESULTS: 870 samples were tested by RT-PCR. Overall viral load was highest in the first week (median nasopharynx 3.5, IQR 1.5-4.3; median sputum 4.3, IQR 3.3-5.6) and decreased over time. In 20% of patients a relapsing pattern was observed. Nasopharyngeal and sputum PCR status on day 14 was not significantly associated with survival up to day 60 in this small cohort. CONCLUSION: In general SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels in respiratory samples in patients with severe COVID-19 decrease after the first week after intubation, but individual SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels can show a relapsing pattern. Larger studies are needed to address the association of clearance of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from respiratory samples with survival, because we observed a trend towards better survival in patients with early clearance from sputum.","Boef, Anna G C; van Wezel, Esther M; Gard, Lilli; Netkova, Kala; Lokate, Mariëtte; van der Voort, Peter H J; Niesters, Hubert G M; Van Leer Buter, Coretta",J Crit Care,79,16

We propose to investigate the question of how societies as a whole, and governments in particular, modulate the dynamics of a novel epidemic using a generalization of the SIR model, the reactive SIR (short-term and long-term reaction) model. We posit that containment measures are equivalent to a feedback between the status of the outbreak and the reproduction factor. Short-term reaction to an outbreak corresponds in this framework to the reaction of governments and individuals to daily cases and fatalities. The reaction to the cumulative number of cases or deaths, and not to daily numbers, is captured in contrast by long-term reaction. We present the exact phase space solution of the controlled SIR model and use it to quantify containment policies for a large number of countries in terms of short and long-term control parameters. We find increased contributions of long-term control for countries and regions in which the outbreak was suppressed substantially together with a strong correlation between the strength of societal and governmental policies and the time needed to contain COVID-19 outbreaks. Furthermore, for numerous countries and regions we identified a predictive relation between the number of fatalities within a fixed period before and after the peak of daily fatality counts, which allows to gauge the cumulative medical load of COVID-19 outbreaks that should be expected after the peak. These results suggest that the proposed model is applicable not only for understanding the outbreak dynamics, but also for predicting future cases and fatalities once the effectiveness of outbreak suppression policies is established with sufficient certainty. Finally, we provide a web app (https://itp.uni-frankfurt.de/covid-19/) with tools for visualising the phase space representation of real-world COVID-19 data and for exporting the preprocessed data for further analysis.","Gros, Claudius; Valenti, Roser; Schneider, Lukas; Gutsche, Benedikt; Markovic, Dimitrije",PLoS One,79,23

The conference was organized by Finnish Geotechnical Society and Finnish Association of Civil Engineers, both from Helsinki. The Nordic Geotechnical Meetings are the oldest regional geotechnical conference series starting from Stockholm since 1950. As the name suggests this event is rather a more informal meeting than an actual formal conference even though normal conference content is followed. The 18th Nordic Geotechnical Meeting, originally scheduled to take place in Helsinki in May 2020, had to be postponed due to COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic and travel restrictions were the reason to organize a virtual conference on 18th-19th January 2021, arranged in parallel with the 14th Baltic Sea Region Geotechnical Conference. The 18th NGM attracted total of 271 participants from 32 countries, successfully allowing to share insights and discuss ideas related to Urban Geotechnics, the main topic of the meeting. The 18th NGM proceedings contain 78 scientific papers presented during the conference alongside 16 industry presentations. In the proceedings, the papers are divided into sections related to: • Case histories • Soil and rock investigations (incl. geophysical methods) • Slope stability and other geohazards • Climate change and circular economy • Eurocode and standardization • Modelling, monitoring and digital solutions • Ground improvement methods • Foundations and deep excavations • Transport infrastructure • Statistical methods, risk analysis and reliability-based design • Cold regions – frost. Furthermore, three keynote speakers presented during the 18th NGM. The signature keynote entitled “From soft soil modelling to engineering application” was given by Professor Minna Karstunen from the Chalmers University of Technology. The other two keynotes were awarded jointly with 14th BSGC: Professor Masaki Kitazume “Applications of deep mixing technology for mitigating earthquake disaster in Urban Area” from Tokyo Institute of Technology, Japan, and professor Jean-Sebastien L’Heureux “On the use of benchmark test sites for research and development in geotechnical engineering” from the Norwegian University of science and technology. The conference had 66 oral presentations and 26 on-demand prerecorded presentations. For both conferences, four parallel streams were created. The conference platform used was ExOrdo. After each presentation there was about five minutes possibility to ask questions. Also chat possibility was available during presentations. The conference platform has been open for two months after the conference. The audience has been given possibility to continue discussion during these two months through the ExOrdo platform. Organizers asked participants to fill a feedback survey and the conference was considered successful as the participants gave 3.9 for overall conference experience and 3.8 for the virtual platform of the event (scale 1 poor … 5 excellent). We wish to express our thanks to all the authors and keynote speakers for their valuable contribution to the success of the conference. We want also to thank our sponsors, session chairs, stage managers, members of scientific board and organization committee, without whom this event would not be possible.

MethodsMixed methods evaluation of LFT among University of Bristol students comprising an analysis of testing uptake using logistic regression analyses; a survey; and qualitative interviews to explore experiences of testing and subsequent behaviour. Results12,391 LFTs were conducted on 8025/36,054 (22.3%) students. Only one in 10 students had the recommended two tests. There were striking demographic disparities in uptake with those from ethnic minority groups having lower uptake (e.g. 3% of Chinese students were tested vs. 30.7% of White students), and variations by level and year of study (ranging from 5.3% to 33.7%), place of residence (29.0% to 35.6%) and faculty (15.2% to 32.8%). Barriers to engagement with testing included a lack of awareness, knowledge and understanding, and concerns about the accuracy and safety. Students understood limitations of LFTs but requested further information about test accuracy. Tests were used to inform behavioural decisions, often in combination with other information, such as the potential for exposure to the virus and perceptions of vulnerability. ConclusionsThe low uptake of testing brings into question the role of mass LFT in university settings.","French, Clare E; Denford, Sarah; Brooks-Pollock, Ellen; Wehling, Helena; Hickman, Matthew",,79,22

Data sources: MEDLINE (PubMed) and CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature) databases. Study selection: Studies were included in the systematic review if they reported postoperative mortality in patients with COVID-19 infection who underwent operative intervention for hip fracture. From this selection of studies, only investigations that reported postoperative mortality in a COVID-positive and a non-COVID group were included in the meta-analysis. Data extraction: Data regarding patient demographics, age, and sex were recorded. Additional data that was extracted included study location, data collection period, length of follow-up, COVID testing methodology, COVID testing results, and number of patients who underwent operative versus nonoperative management. The primary outcome of interest was postoperative mortality. Data synthesis: Random effects meta-analyses were performed to assess the pooled relative risk of postoperative mortality according to COVID status. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. Conclusions: The overall pooled mortality rate in the early postoperative period for hip fracture patients with concomitant COVID-19 infection was 32.6%. The relative risk for postoperative mortality in COVID-positive patients compared to non-COVID patients was 5.66 (95% CI 4.01-7.98; p < 0.001). The currently available literature demonstrates that COVID-19 infection represents a substantial risk factor for early postoperative mortality in the already susceptible hip fracture population.

People living with human immunodeficiency virus (PLHIV) have concerns about whether they have a higher risk of getting the infection and suffer worse COVID-19 outcomes. Findings from studies on these questions have largely been inconsistent. We aimed to determine the epidemiological characteristics, clinical signs and symptoms, blood parameters, and clinical outcomes among PLHIV who contracted COVID-19. Relevant studies were identified through Medline, Cinahl, and PubMed databases. A random-effects model was used in meta-analyses with a 95% confidence interval. Eighty-two studies were included in the systematic review and sixty-seven studies for the meta-analysis. The pooled incidence proportion of COVID-19 among PLHIV was 0.9% (95% CI 0.6%, 1.1%) based on the data from seven cohort studies. Overall, 28.4% were hospitalised, of whom, 2.5% was severe-critical cases and 3.5% needed intensive care. The overall mortality rate was 5.3%. Hypertension was the most commonly reported comorbidity (24.0%). Fever (71.1%) was the most common symptom. Chest imaging demonstrated a wide range of abnormal findings encompassing common changes such as ground glass opacities and consolidation as well as a spectrum of less common abnormalities. Laboratory testing of inflammation markers showed that C-reactive protein, ferritin, and interleukin-6 were frequently elevated, albeit to different extents. Clinical features as well as the results of chest imaging and laboratory testing were similar in highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART)-treated and non-treated patients. PLHIV were not found to be at higher risk for adverse outcomes of COVID-19. Hence, in COVID-19 management, it appears that they can be treated the same way as HIV negative individuals. Nevertheless, as the pandemic situation is rapidly evolving, more evidence may be needed to arrive at definitive recommendations.","Lee, Kai Wei; Yap, Sook Fan; Ngeow, Yun Fong; Lye, Munn Sann",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),79,20

Typhoid culture and sensitivity were recorded and patients were treated accordingly. Patients were asked about risk factors to aim at informing prevention. RESULTS: Out of the 52 having blood culture positive for Salmonella Typhi 47 (90.4%) and Salmonella Paratyphi 5 (9.6%), 4 (7.7%) were sensitive to first-line (Non-resistant), 11 (21.2%) MDR and 37 (71.2%) patient were XDR. One case was resistant to azithromycin. Nausea, vomiting or, abdominal pain was present in 12 (23%), abdominal distension present in 9 (17.3%), abdominal tenderness in 8 (15.4%), hepatomegaly in 10 (19.2%) and, splenomegaly in 22 (42.3%).There were ultrasound abnormalities in 58% of patients and GI complications in 19% of patients. No significant difference was found in clinical findings and complications between resistant and non-resistant cases. Only 23-27% of patients were aware of typhoid prevention and vaccination measures. CONCLUSIONS: The increasing prevalence of resistance and higher degree of complications seen in typhoid fever raises the concern further about prevention and effective infection management in the community as well as clinical settings. Moreover, judicial use of antibiotics is much needed in developing countries like Pakistan.","Fida, Samina; Mansoor, Hala; Saif, Saba; Iqbal, Javed; Khan, Arif Qayyum",J Infect Dev Ctries,79,16

The pandemic is historic in scope and precedent given its emergence in an increasingly digital era. Importantly, there have been concerns about the accuracy of COVID-19 case counts due to issues such as lack of access to testing and difficulty in measuring recoveries. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to detect and characterize user-generated conversations that could be associated with COVID-19-related symptoms, experiences with access to testing, and mentions of disease recovery using an unsupervised machine learning approach. METHODS: Tweets were collected from the Twitter public streaming application programming interface from March 3-20, 2020, filtered for general COVID-19-related keywords and then further filtered for terms that could be related to COVID-19 symptoms as self-reported by users. Tweets were analyzed using an unsupervised machine learning approach called the biterm topic model (BTM), where groups of tweets containing the same word-related themes were separated into topic clusters that included conversations about symptoms, testing, and recovery. Tweets in these clusters were then extracted and manually annotated for content analysis and assessed for their statistical and geographic characteristics. RESULTS: A total of 4,492,954 tweets were collected that contained terms that could be related to COVID-19 symptoms. After using BTM to identify relevant topic clusters and removing duplicate tweets, we identified a total of 3465 (<1%) tweets that included user-generated conversations about experiences that users associated with possible COVID-19 symptoms and other disease experiences. These tweets were grouped into five main categories including first- and secondhand reports of symptoms, symptom reporting concurrent with lack of testing, discussion of recovery, confirmation of negative COVID-19 diagnosis after receiving testing, and users recalling symptoms and questioning whether they might have been previously infected with COVID-19. The co-occurrence of tweets for these themes was statistically significant for users reporting symptoms with a lack of testing and with a discussion of recovery. A total of 63% (n=1112) of the geotagged tweets were located in the United States. CONCLUSIONS: This study used unsupervised machine learning for the purposes of characterizing self-reporting of symptoms, experiences with testing, and mentions of recovery related to COVID-19. Many users reported symptoms they thought were related to COVID-19, but they were not able to get tested to confirm their concerns. In the absence of testing availability and confirmation, accurate case estimations for this period of the outbreak may never be known. Future studies should continue to explore the utility of infoveillance approaches to estimate COVID-19 disease severity.","Mackey, Tim; Purushothaman, Vidya; Li, Jiawei; Shah, Neal; Nali, Matthew; Bardier, Cortni; Liang, Bryan; Cai, Mingxiang; Cuomo, Raphael",JMIR Public Health Surveill,79,16

To avoid system collapse, governments have resorted to several social distancing measures. In Belgium, this included a lockdown and a following period of phased re-opening. A representative sample of Belgian adults was asked about their contact behaviour from mid-April to the beginning of August, during different stages of the intervention measures in Belgium. Use of personal protection equipment (face masks) and compliance to hygienic measures was also reported. We estimated the expected reproduction number computing the ratio of [Formula: see text] with respect to pre-pandemic data. During the first two waves (the first month) of the survey, the reduction in the average number of contacts was around 80% and was quite consistent across all age-classes. The average number of contacts increased over time, particularly for the younger age classes, still remaining significantly lower than pre-pandemic values. From the end of May to the end of July , the estimated reproduction number has a median value larger than one, although with a wide dispersion. Estimated [Formula: see text] fell below one again at the beginning of August. We have shown how a rapidly deployed survey can measure compliance to social distancing and assess its impact on COVID-19 spread.

The frequency of acute cardiac injury in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 is unknown. The objective was to compare the rates of cardiac injury by angiotensin-converting enzyme-2-binding viruses from viruses that do not bind to angiotensin-converting enzyme-2. DATA SOURCES: We performed a systematic review of coronavirus disease 2019 literature on PubMed and EMBASE. STUDY SELECTION: We included studies with ten or more hospitalized adults with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 or other viral pathogens that described the occurrence of acute cardiac injury. This was defined by the original publication authors or by: 1) myocardial ischemia, 2) new cardiac arrhythmia on echocardiogram, or 3) new or worsening heart failure on echocardiogram. DATA EXTRACTION: We compared the rates of cardiac injury among patients with respiratory infections with viruses that down-regulate angiotensin-converting enzyme-2, including H1N1, H5N1, H7N9, and severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus-1, to those with respiratory infections from other influenza viruses that do not bind angiotensin-converting enzyme-2, including Influenza H3N2 and influenza B. DATA SYNTHESIS: Of 57 studies including 34,072 patients, acute cardiac injury occurred in 50% (95% CI, 44-57%) of critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019. The overall risk of acute cardiac injury was 21% (95% CI, 18-26%) among hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019. In comparison, 37% (95% CI, 26-49%) of critically ill patients with other respiratory viruses that bind angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (p = 0.061) and 12% (95% CI, 7-22%) of critically ill patients with other respiratory viruses that do not bind angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (p < 0.001) experienced a cardiac injury. CONCLUSIONS: Acute cardiac injury may be associated with whether the virus binds angiotensin-converting enzyme-2. Acute cardiac injury occurs in half of critically ill coronavirus disease 2019 patients, but only 12% of patients infected by viruses that do not bind to angiotensin-converting enzyme-2.","Cheng, Matthew P; Cau, Alessandro; Lee, Todd C; Brodie, Daniel; Slutsky, Arthur; Marshall, John; Murthy, Srin; Lee, Terry; Singer, Joel; Demir, Koray K; Boyd, John; Ohm, Hyejee; Maslove, David; Goffi, Alberto; Bogoch, Isaac I; Sweet, David D; Walley, Keith R; Russell, James A",Crit. care med,79,20

We conducted an online study during the epidemic to explore the mental state of tumor patients and their families during this extraordinary time. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was carried out. Questionnaires were distributed through the WeChat ""Questionnaire Star"" network. The snowball sampling technique was adopted and further promoted by subjects who had completed the questionnaire. RESULTS: A total of 1,030 valid questionnaires were collected. There were 609 (59.13%) tumor patients and 421 (40.87%) family members. One hundred and fifty-six (15.15%) subjects had anxiety, among which 65 (6.31%) had moderate to severe anxiety. Single-factor analysis indicated that age (>60 years old), the farmer occupation, and a high sleep disorder assessment score were risk factors for anxiety, while the latter two might also be independent risk factors, as suggested by multi-factor analysis. Infrequent contact with doctors was an independent risk factor for cancer patients, while uninterrupted anti-tumor therapy was an independent protective factor. 40.19% of the subjects expressed a need for psychosocial support during the COVID-19 period. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 outbreak resulted in tumor patients and their relatives experiencing greater psychological pressure than usual, and patients were more worried about anti-tumor treatment and disease progression impacted by the epidemic. Both groups had a significant need for psychosocial help.","Yang, Shengli; Yao, Huang; Song, Yating; Shu, Chengrong; Chen, Mengni; Pi, Guoliang; Jin, Min; Chen, Renwang; Wang, Qiushuang; Chang, Jian; Zuo, Zhigang; Hu, Jianli",Ann Palliat Med,79,1

Initially, after the model formulation, we utilize the well-known least square approach to estimate the model parameters from the reported COVID-19 cases in Algeria for a selected period of time. We perform the existence and uniqueness of the model solution which are proved via the Picard-Lindelöf method. We further compute the basic reproduction numbers and equilibrium points, then we explore the local and global stability of both the disease-free equilibrium point and the endemic equilibrium point. Finally, numerical results and graphical simulation are given to demonstrate the impact of various model parameters and fractional order on the disease dynamics and control.","Hadj Moussa, Yacine El; Boudaoui, Ahmed; Ullah, Saif; Bozkurt, Fatma; Abdeljawad, Thabet; Alqudah, Manar A",Results Phys,79,1

Methods: A case-control study was conducted on the Saudi Arabian population during September 2020. The data were collected from recovered COVID-19 participants as the case group, and healthy volunteers as the control group. Results: The data showed that 42.2% (n = 315) of recovered COVID-19 cases were more willing to participate in the COVID-19 vaccine trial than healthy volunteers (299; 38.1%) with a p < 0.001. The proportion of the participants who were willing to donate plasma was significantly higher among recovered participants, 84.2% (n = 112), than healthy volunteers, 76.3% (n = 87), with a p < 0.0001. The most significant factor responsible for a willingness to participate was the belief that vaccine discovery would help scientific developments (r = 0.525 and 0.465 for case and control, respectively). In comparison, significant reasons behind the unwillingness to participate were the risk of exposure to an unproven vaccine, r = 0.377 and 0.497 for case and control, respectively (p < 0.001), and a discomfort with being treated as an experimental subject (r = 0.275 and 0.374 for case and control, respectively). Conclusions: The differences in readiness toward the COVID-19 vaccine trial in our study does not indicate any passive exposure of participants to an unproven clinical trial vaccine, nor does it shed light on well-informed risk-related decisions. However, certain factors can significantly influence decision-making while contributing toward clinical research.

This shift provided an opportunity to identify limitations in the current healthcare infrastructure and how these may impact the health and well-being of persons with HD. OBJECTIVE: The study objectives were to assess the feasibility of remote healthcare delivery in HD patients, to identify socioeconomic factors which may explain differences in feasibility and to evaluate the impact of safer-at-home orders on HD patient stress levels. METHODS: This observational study of a clinical HD population during the 'safer-at-home' orders asked patients or caregivers about their current access to healthcare resources and patient stress levels. A chart review allowed for an assessment of socioeconomic status and characterization of HD severity. RESULTS: Two-hundred and twelve HD patients were contacted with 156 completing the survey. During safer-at-home orders, the majority of HD patients were able to obtain medications and see a physician; however, 25% of patients would not commit to regular telehealth visits, and less than 50% utilized an online healthcare platform. We found that 37% of participants were divorced/single, 39% had less than a high school diploma, and nearly 20% were uninsured or on low-income health insurance. Patient stress levels correlated with disease burden. CONCLUSION: A significant portion of HD participants were not willing to participate in telehealth services. Potential explanations for these limitations may include socioeconomic barriers and caregiving structure. These observations illustrate areas for clinical care improvement to address healthcare disparities in the HD community.","Pfalzer, Anna C; Hale, Lisa M; Huitz, Elizabeth; Buchanan, Danielle A; Brown, Brittany K; Moroz, Sarah; Rouleau, Renee M; Hay, Kaitlyn R; Hoadley, Jennifer; Laird, Amy; Ciriegio, Abagail E; Watson, Kelly H; Jones, Maile T; Lin, Ya-Chen; Kang, Hakmook; Riordan, Heather; Isaacs, David A; McDonell, Katherine E; Compas, Bruce E; Claassen, Daniel O",J Huntingtons Dis,79,24

Therefore, identifying the main determinants of environmental degradation is one of the primary agenda items of researchers and policymakers. In the literature, many social, economic, and sectorial factors related to the main determinants of CO2 emissions have been studied. Although these studies provide very important information about the causes of CO2 emissions and environmental degradation, some deficiencies remain in the related literature. The agricultural sector activities, which are an important sector at a global level and have significant potential impacts on CO2 emissions, have not been adequately studied. In order to fill this gap, the effects of agriculture and renewable energy on CO2 emissions were examined for lucky-seven countries during the period 1995-2014. The results of panel cointegration reveal the presence of long-run nexus among the variables. While the findings indicate that agriculture increases CO2 emissions, renewable energy is a very important catalyst in reducing CO2 emissions in lucky-seven countries. We also found that economic growth and energy consumption enhance CO2 emissions and trade openness decreases. Panel VECM results indicate that variables are the causes of CO2 emission in the long run.

RESULTS: We found 94 EEG from 62 patients (55 % men, mean age 59.7 ± 17.8 years) were analyzed. Most frequent comorbidity was cardiac (52 %), followed by metabolic (45 %) and CNS disease (39 %). Patients required ICU management by 60 %, with a mortality of 27 % in the whole cohort. The most frequent EEG finding was generalized continuous slow-wave activity (66 %). Epileptic activity was observed in 19 % including non-convulsive status epilepticus, seizures and interictal epileptiform discharges. Periodic patterns were observed in 3 patients (3.2 %). Multivariate analysis found that cancer comorbidity and requiring an EEG during the third week of evolution portended a higher risk of mortality CONCLUSION: We observed that the most prevalent EEG finding in this cohort was generalized continuous slow-wave activity, while epileptic activity was observed in less than 20 % of the cases. Mortality risk factors were comorbidity with cancer and requiring an EEG during the third week of evolution, possibly related to the hyperinflammatory state.","Skorin, Ilona; Carrillo, Rogelio; Perez, Carmen P; Sanchez, Natalie; Parra, Jorge; Troncoso, Patricia; Uribe-San-Martin, Reinaldo",Seizure,79,1

CDC monitors coverage with ACIP-recommended vaccines through the National Immunization Survey-Child (NIS-Child); data from the survey were used to estimate vaccination coverage at the national, regional, state, territorial, and selected local area levels among children born in 2016 and 2017. National coverage by age 24 months was &#8805;90% for &#8805;3 doses of poliovirus vaccine, &#8805;3 doses of hepatitis B vaccine (HepB), and &#8805;1 dose of varicella vaccine (VAR); national coverage was &#8805;90% for &#8805;1 dose of measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR), although MMR coverage was <90% in 14 states. Coverage with &#8805;2 doses of influenza vaccine was higher for children born during 2016-2017 (58.1%) than for those born during 2014-2015 (53.8%) but was the lowest among all vaccines studied. Only 1.2% of children had received no vaccinations by age 24 months. Vaccination coverage among children enrolled in Medicaid or with no health insurance was lower than that among children who were privately insured. The prevalence of being completely unvaccinated was highest among uninsured children (4.1%), lower among those enrolled in Medicaid (1.3%), and lowest among those with private insurance (0.8%). The largest disparities on the basis of health insurance status occurred for &#8805;2 doses of influenza vaccine and for completion of the rotavirus vaccination series. Considering the disruptions to health care provider operations caused by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, extra effort will be required to achieve and maintain high levels of coverage with routine childhood vaccinations. Providers, health care entities, and public health authorities can communicate with families about how children can be vaccinated safely during the pandemic, remind parents of vaccinations that are due for their children, and provide all recommended vaccinations to children during clinic visits. This will be especially important for 2020-21 seasonal influenza vaccination to mitigate the effect of two potentially serious respiratory viruses circulating in the community simultaneously.","Hill, Holly A; Yankey, David; Elam-Evans, Laurie D; Singleton, James A; Pingali, S Cassandra; Santibanez, Tammy A",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,79,24

However, the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 through aerosols remains unclear. In this study, computational fluid dynamic (CFD) is used to complement the investigation of the SARS-CoV-2 transmission through aerosol. The Lagrangian particle tracking method was used to analyze the dispersion of the exhaled particles from a SARS-CoV-2-positive patient under different exhale activities and different flow rates of chilled (cooling) air supply. Air sampling of the SARS-CoV-2 patient ward was conducted for 48-h measurement intervals to collect the indoor air sample for particulate with diameter less than 2.5 µm. Then, the reverse transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was conducted to analyze the collected air sample.

PURPOSE: A regional task force of health-system pharmacy leaders was created to assist with successful adoption of United States Pharmacopeia (USP) general chapter <800>. SUMMARY: A group of pharmacy leaders in the Kansas City region identified potential benefits to healthcare personnel and patients if hazardous drug handling procedures were standardized. A task force was created, a preimplementation survey was distributed, and meetings were held monthly to discuss sections of USP <800> identified as the most challenging to implement. The task force focused on an assessment of risk tool, hot topics, cleanroom design, and a detailed analysis of controversial medications. After the first year of meetings, a postimplementation survey was distributed, and the results were analyzed. The task force created significant value for the participants and achieved the goal of facilitating efficient USP <800> implementation resulting in greater compliance and consistency across the multiple health systems represented. Over 5,100 beds and 200 clinic sites were affected by this task force's efforts. Nearly three-fourths (73%) of respondents reported that the task force was ""extremely helpful,"" and the majority (64%) of respondents adopted most or all (81%-100%) of the task force's assessment of risk choices. Prioritization of tasks, information sharing, and decision-making were areas where the individual leaders were most supported. CONCLUSION: Creating a structure to eliminate barriers and facilitate collaboration among regional pharmacy leaders provided a framework for successful implementation of USP <800> requirements. This interdependent leadership model produced innovative and standardized solutions and should be considered when addressing complicated initiatives that impact the profession.","Duty, Ashley; Robinson, Joanna; Bahmandar, Della; Hanson, Nathan; Lucas, Amber",Am. j. health system pharm,79,24

This article describes the results of a survey of 295 psychologists and psychiatrists concerning their experiences and opinions of forensic tele-service work. Participants identified a range of benefits to using audiovisual (AV) conferencing technologies, including efficiency, convenience, ease of access, safety, client comfort, and flexibility. However, issues were also reported, including concerns that some aspects of the mental status examination, specifically appearance and behavior and affect, may be difficult to assess. There were also some clinical conditions that were considered by participants to be unsuitable for tele-servicing. Although most participants believed that the therapeutic relationship was less satisfactory when using AV conferencing as compared with face-to-face interactions, on average, participants were satisfied with the therapeutic relationship that was developed. Further, some participants (n = 38, 27.1%) reported that clients had expressed a preference for remote engagement, but a similar number reported that some had expressed concerns about receiving treatment remotely (n = 38, 26.4%). Although recent training and experience were associated with confidence, perceived confidence, and satisfaction with tele-services, fewer than half of participants (n = 112, 44.8%) had received training in tele-service use. Overall, there appears to be a range of benefits to using tele-services for remote forensic assessment and treatment practice, but there are issues that need to be considered, and best-practice guidelines require development.

With the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic, new systems were developed quickly. The chest radiography is one of the least expensive among the imaging exams that assist in the detection of COVID-19. Despite not having high sensitivity for pattern detection compared to other tests - such as ground-glass opacities in computed tomography - this test helps screen infected patients. Therefore, in this work, we propose a methodology for detecting COVID-19 in chest radiography considering three possible scenarios: the healthy, presence of COVID-19, and presence of other pathologies. We developed the methodology by evaluating transfer learning techniques in five well know pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) architectures. For training CNNs, we used 1,932 healthy images, 3,651 of other pathologies, and 1,436 images related to the presence of COVID-19. We obtained an accuracy of 94.36% in the scenario COVID-19 vs. healthy, 99.80% for COVID-19 vs. others pathologies, and 95.01% differentiating in three classes.

This paper compares and contrasts the experiences of 15 clinicians in six different African cancer centers to highlight the positive aspects (silver linings) in an otherwise negative situation. METHODS: Data are from personal experience of the clinicians working at the six cancer centers blended with what is available in the literature. RESULTS: The impact of COVID-19 on cancer care appeared to vary not only across the continent but also over cancer centers. Different factors such as clinic location, services offered, available resources, and level of restrictions imposed because of COVID-19 were associated with these variations. Collectively, delays in treatment and limited access to cancer care were commonly reported in the different regions. CONCLUSION: There is a lack of data on cancer patients with COVID-19 and online COVID-19 and cancer registries for Africa. Analysis of the available data, however, suggests a higher mortality rate for cancer patients with COVID-19 compared with those without cancer. Positive or silver linings coming out of the pandemic include the adoption of hypofractionated radiation therapy and teleoncology to enhance access to care while protecting patients and staff members. Increasing collaborations using online technology with oncology health professionals across the world are also being seen as a silver lining, with valuable sharing of experiences and expertise to improve care, enhance learning, and reduce disparities. Advanced information and communication technologies are seen as vital for such collaborations and could avail efforts in dealing with the ongoing pandemic and potential future crises.","Grossheim, Linda; Ruff, Paul; Ngoma, Twalib; Vanderpuye, Verna; Mwango, Gladys; Ochieng, Primus; Palmer, Dennis; Kouya, Francine; Lasebikan, Nwamaka; Ntekim, Atara; Ngoma, Mamsau; Bih, Noella; Malloum, Abba; Elzawawy, Ahmed; Kerr, David; Ngwa, Wilfred",JCO Glob Oncol,79,16

Patients vulnerable to severe COVID-19 are at risk of hydroxychloroquine interactions with co-morbidities and co-medications contributing to detrimental, including fatal, adverse treatment effects. METHODS: A retrospective survey was undertaken of health conditions and co-medications of patients with COVID-19 who were pre-screened for enrolment in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled hydroxychloroquine multi-centre trial. RESULTS: The survey involved 305 patients [median age 71 (interquartile range 59-81) years]. The majority of patients (n = 279, 92%) considered for inclusion in the clinical trial were not eligible, mainly due to safety concerns caused by health conditions or co-medications. The most common were QT-prolonging drugs (n = 188, 62%) and haematologic/haemato-oncologic diseases (n = 39, 13%) which prohibited the administration of hydroxychloroquine. In addition, 165 (54%) patients had health conditions and 167 (55%) patients were on co-medications that did not prohibit the use of hydroxychloroquine but had a risk of adverse interactions with hydroxychloroquine. The most common were diabetes (n = 86, 28%), renal insufficiency (n = 69, 23%) and heart failure (n = 58, 19%).

Black communities (including Africans, the African diaspora and people of African descent) experience worse health outcomes as demonstrated by almost any measure of health and wellbeing-e.g. life expectancy; disease prevalence; maternal mortality rates. While health promotion has its foundation in promoting equity and social justice, it is clear that however well-intended, we are not affecting meaningful change for Black communities quickly enough. Through this article, we outline the intersection of social determinants of health and anti-Black racism. We describe how in the first 8 months of 2020 Black communities around the globe have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19, while also having to respond to new instances of police brutality. We assert that the time has come for health promotion to stop neutralizing the specific needs of Black communities into unspoken 'good intentions'.

The model couples a system of kinetic transport equations describing a population of commuters moving on a large scale (extra-urban) with a system of diffusion equations characterizing the non-commuting population acting over a small scale (urban). The modeling approach permits to avoid unrealistic effects of traditional diffusion models in epidemiology, like infinite propagation speed on large scales and mass migration dynamics. A construction based on the transport formalism of kinetic theory allows to give a clear model interpretation to the interactions between infected and susceptible in compartmental space-dependent models. In addition, in a suitable scaling limit, our approach permits to couple the two populations through a consistent diffusion model acting at the urban scale. A discretization of the system based on finite volumes on unstructured grids, combined with an asymptotic preserving method in time, shows that the model is able to describe correctly the main features of the spatial expansion of an epidemic. An application to the initial spread of COVID-19 is finally presented. © 2021 World Scientific Publishing Company.","Boscheri, W.; Dimarco, G.; Pareschi, L.",Mathematical Models and Methods in Applied Sciences,79,24

The infection has been reported in most countries around the world. As of August 2020, there have been over 21 million cases of COVID-19 reported worldwide, with over 800 000 COVID-19-associated deaths. It has become apparent that although COVID-19 predominantly affects the respiratory system, many other organ systems can also be involved. Imaging plays an essential role in the diagnosis of all manifestations of the disease, as well as its related complications, and proper utilization and interpretation of imaging examinations is crucial. With the growing global COVID-19 outbreak, a comprehensive understanding of the diagnostic imaging hallmarks, imaging features, multisystemic involvement, and evolution of imaging findings is essential for effective patient management and treatment. To date, only a few articles have been published that comprehensively describe the multisystemic imaging manifestations of COVID-19.

It was conducted based on the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA). Criteria for eligibility were all published population-based primary literature in PubMed interface and the Science Direct, dealing with incubation period of COVID-19, written in English, since December 2019 to December 2020. We estimated the mean of the incubation period using meta-analysis, taking into account between-study heterogeneity, and the analysis with moderator variables. RESULTS: This review included 42 studies done predominantly in China. The mean and median incubation period were of maximum 8 days and 12 days respectively. In various parametric models, the 95th percentiles were in the range 10.3-16 days. The highest 99th percentile would be as long as 20.4 days. Out of the 10 included studies in the meta-analysis, 8 were conducted in China, 1 in Singapore, and 1 in Argentina. The pooled mean incubation period was 6.2 (95% CI 5.4, 7.0) days. The heterogeneity (I2 77.1%; p < 0.001) was decreased when we included the study quality and the method of calculation used as moderator variables (I2 0%). The mean incubation period ranged from 5.2 (95% CI 4.4 to 5.9) to 6.65 days (95% CI 6.0 to 7.2).

Some members of the TTSP family are implicated in viral infection. TMPRSS11A is a TTSP expressed on the surface of airway epithelial cells, which has been shown to cleave and activate spike proteins of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (CoVs). In this study, we examined the mechanism underlying the activation cleavage of TMPRSS11A that converts the one-chain zymogen to a two-chain enzyme. By expression in human embryonic kidney 293, esophageal EC9706, and lung epithelial A549 and 16HBE cells, Western blotting, and site-directed mutagenesis, we found that the activation cleavage of human TMPRSS11A was mediated by autocatalysis. Moreover, we found that TMPRSS11A activation cleavage occurred before the protein reached the cell surface, as indicated by studies with trypsin digestion to remove cell surface proteins, treatment with cell organelle-disturbing agents to block intracellular protein trafficking, and analysis of a soluble form of TMPRSS11A without the transmembrane domain. We also showed that TMPRSS11A was able to cleave the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. These results reveal an intracellular autocleavage mechanism in TMPRSS11A zymogen activation, which differs from the extracellular zymogen activation reported in other TTSPs. These findings provide new insights into the diverse mechanisms in regulating TTSP activation.","Zhang, Ce; Zhang, Yikai; Zhang, Shengnan; Wang, Zhiting; Sun, Shijin; Liu, Meng; Chen, Yue; Dong, Ningzheng; Wu, Qingyu",J Biol Chem,79,20

Patients with pulmonary diseases in the COVID-19 pandemic period were analyzed. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Non-COVID-19 cases who were hospitalized in the pulmonology clinic, outpatients, and patients who applied to the non-COVID-19 emergency service and requested a pulmonology consultation in the period from March 16, 2020 to May 15, 2020 and in the same period of the previous year (i.e., from March 16, 2019 to May 15, 2019) were included in this study. RESULTS: In the pandemic period, it was found that there was an 84% decrease in outpatient admissions, a 43% decrease in inpatients, and a 75% decrease in emergency services. During the pandemic period, in outpatient setting, male and younger case admissions increased, admissions with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and interstitial lung diseases decreased, whereas the frequency of admission to asthma, pneumonia, and pulmonary thromboembolism increased. In the period of the pandemic, patients with asthma, COPD, and lung cancer were less hospitalized, whereas patients with pulmonary thromboembolism, pneumonia, and pleural effusion were hospitalized more. In non-COVID-19 patient treatments during the pandemic period, usage of a metered dose inhaler increased. CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, non-COVID pulmonary pathologies decreased significantly, and there was a change in the profile of the patients. From now on, to be prepared for pandemic and similar extraordinary situations, to organize hospitals for the epidemic, to determine health institutions to which nonepidemic patients can apply, to make necessary plans in order not to neglect the nonepidemic patients, and to develop digital health service methods, especially telemedicine, would be appropriate.","Sevinç, Can; Tertemiz, Kemal Can; Atik, Merve; Güler, Nurcan; Ulusoy, Mustafa; Coskun, Figen; Uyar, Nezihe; Ellidokuz, Hülya; Itil, Oya; Cimrin, Arif Hikmet; Uçan, Eyup Sabri",Turk Thorac J,79,26

It entered an X-ray outburst in 1992 and has been active ever since, showing the longest transient outburst from an X-ray binary as of yet. Since 2018 GRS 1915+105 has declined into an extended low-flux X-ray plateau, occasionally interrupted by multi-wavelength flares. Here we report the radio and X-ray properties of GRS 1915+105 collected in this new phase, and compare the recent data to historic observations. We find that while the X-ray emission remained unprecedentedly low for most of the time following the decline in 2018, the radio emission shows a clear mode change half way through the extended X-ray plateau in 2019 June: from low flux (~3mJy) and limited variability, to marked flaring with fluxes two orders of magnitude larger. GRS 1915+105 appears to have entered a low-luminosity canonical hard state, and then transitioned to a highly unusual accretion phase, characterised by heavy X-ray absorption/obscuration. Hence, we argue that a local absorber hides from the observer the accretion processes feeding the variable jet responsible for the marked radio flaring. The radio--X-ray correlation suggests that the current low X-ray flux state may be a signature of a super-Eddington state akin to the X-ray binaries SS433 or V404 Cyg.","Motta, S. E.; Kajava, J. J.

There was no ACE2 expression on platelets and very low level of ACE2 protein expression on the surface of human primary pulmonary alveolar epithelial cells. The ACE2 expression was markedly upregulated on the activated type 1 macrophages (M1). Immunohistochemistry demonstrated high expressions of ACE2 on human tissue macrophages, such as alveolar macrophages, Kupffer cells within livers, and microglial cells in brain at steady state.

However, the quantitative link between the accretion flow (traced by X-rays) and outflows and/or jets (traced by radio emission) is much less well-understood for neutron stars than for black holes, other than the general observation that neutron stars are fainter in the radio at a given X-ray luminosity. We use data from the deep MAVERIC radio continuum survey of Galactic globular clusters for a systematic radio and X-ray study of six luminous (L_X>10^34 erg/s) persistent neutron star X-ray binaries in our survey, as well as two other transient systems also captured by our data. We find that these neutron star X-ray binaries show an even larger range in radio luminosity than previously observed. In particular, in quiescence at L_X ~ 3x10^34 erg/s, the confirmed neutron star binary GRS 1747--312 in Terzan 6 sits near the upper envelope of the black hole radio/X-ray correlation, and the persistently accreting neutron star systems AC 211 (in M15) and X1850--087 (in NGC 6712) show unusual radio variability and luminous radio emission. We interpret AC 211 as an obscured""Z source""that is accreting at close to the Eddington limit, while the properties of X1850--087 are difficult to explain, and motivate future coordinated radio and X-ray observations. Overall, our results show that neutron stars do not follow a single relation between inflow and outflow, and confirm that their accretion dynamics are more complex than for black holes.","Panurach, T.; Strader, J.; Bahramian, A.; Chomiuk, L.; Miller-Jones, J.

The aim of this study was to compare 6-month outcomes in older adults diagnosed with medical conditions in the ED then admitted inappropriately to surgical wards (defined as outliers), with outcomes in comparable patients admitted to medical wards (controls). METHODS: In a matched cohort study, 100 consecutive medical outliers from the ED aged 75 years and over were matched according to age, sex and diagnosis to 200 controls. Collected data included number of diagnoses reported in acute care, level of patient illness severity, length of stay, mortality and destination of patients discharged from acute care units (home, rehabilitation facility, nursing home or palliative care facility). An assessment was made of patient vital status and living environment (home, nursing home or hospital) at 6 months post-ED admission. RESULTS: Mean age was 85.6 years. The most common ED diagnoses were gait disorders/falls (18%), neurological disorders (17%) and exhaustion (16%). Outliers displayed lower illness severity levels (0.001) and shorter lengths of stay from ED admission to acute care discharge (p=0.040). Subsequent to acute care, outliers were less commonly discharged home (45% vs 59%) and more commonly discharged to rehabilitation facilities (42% vs 28%). At 6 months post-ED admission, multivariable regression analysis showed that outlier status (OR=0.44 (0.25-0.83); p=0.011) and numbers of diagnoses reported in acute care (OR=0.87 (0.76-0.98); p=0.028) were independently associated with lower probability of living at home. CONCLUSION: Outlying of older patients to surgical wards negatively affects their prospects of living at home at 6 months after hospital admission. Older patients hospitalised via the ED are entitled to appropriate medical care.","Patry, Claire; Perozziello, Anne; Pardineille, Clio; Aubert, Christiane; de Malglaive, Pauline; Choquet, Christophe; Raynaud-Simon, Agathe; Sanchez, Manuel",Emerg. med. j,79,1

Fewer non-SARS-CoV-2 Respiratory Viruses during the COVID-19 Pandemic,13.608409,10.2841425,2021,"Vimentin is an intermediate filament protein that plays key roles in integration of cytoskeletal functions, and therefore in basic cellular processes such as cell division and migration. Consequently, vimentin has complex implications in pathophysiology. Vimentin is required for a proper immune response, but it can also act as an autoantigen in autoimmune diseases or as a damage signal. Although vimentin is a predominantly cytoplasmic protein, it can also appear at extracellular locations, either in a secreted form or at the surface of numerous cell types, often in relation to cell activation, inflammation, injury or senescence. Cell surface targeting of vimentin appears to associate with the occurrence of certain posttranslational modifications, such as phosphorylation and/or oxidative damage. At the cell surface, vimentin can act as a receptor for bacterial and viral pathogens. Indeed, vimentin has been shown to play important roles in virus attachment and entry of severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV), dengue and encephalitis viruses, among others. Moreover, the presence of vimentin in specific virus-targeted cells and its induction by proinflammatory cytokines and tissue damage contribute to its implication in viral infection. Here, we recapitulate some of the pathophysiological implications of vimentin, including the involvement of cell surface vimentin in interaction with pathogens, with a special focus on its role as a cellular receptor or co-receptor for viruses. In addition, we provide a perspective on approaches to target vimentin, including antibodies or chemical agents that could modulate these interactions to potentially interfere with viral pathogenesis, which could be useful when multi-target antiviral strategies are needed.","Ramos, Irene; Stamatakis, Konstantinos; Oeste, Clara L; Pérez-Sala, Dolores",,79,1

This study was carried out to determine the diagnostic accuracy of saliva for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR in ambulatory children. METHODS: During 1 to 23 October 2020, we recruited a population-based sample of children presenting for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) screening in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Each child provided paired nasopharyngeal (NP) swab and saliva for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR N, E and RdRp gene detection. RESULTS: Paired NP swab and saliva samples were obtained from 476 children with mean ± standard deviation age of 10.8 ± 3.9 years, and 58.2% were male (277/476). Nine participants were sampled twice, so 485 pairs of NP swab/saliva were tested. Virus detection in at least one specimen type was reported in 17.9% (87/485), with similar detection in NP swab (16.7%, 81/485) and saliva (15.9%, 77/485). Sensitivity and specificity of saliva RT-PCR was 87.7% (95% confidence interval (CI) 78.5-93.9) and 98.5% (95% CI 96.8-99.5). The positive and negative predictive values were 92.2% (95% CI 84.2-96.3) and 97.6% (95% CI 95.7-98.6), with a kappa coefficient of 0.879 (95% CI 0.821-0.937). Concordance of findings between NP swab and saliva did not differ by age (p 0.67) or gender (p 0.29). Cycle threshold (Ct) values were significantly higher in NP swab/saliva pairs with discordant findings compared to those with both specimens positive. CONCLUSIONS: In light of these findings, we recommend saliva as a diagnostic specimen for COVID-19 screening in children.","Al Suwaidi, Hanan; Senok, Abiola; Varghese, Rupa; Deesi, Zulfa; Khansaheb, Hamda; Pokasirakath, Sabeel; Chacko, Bino; Abufara, Ibrahim; Loney, Tom; Alsheikh-Ali, Alawi",Clin. microbiol. infect,79,21

Thiocyanate can outcompete chlorine anions and other halides (F-, Br-, I-) as substrates for myeloperoxidase by undergoing two-electron oxidation with hydrogen peroxide. This forms their respective hypohalous acids (HOX where X- = halides) and in the case of thiocyanate, hypothiocyanous acid (HOSCN), which is also a bactericidal oxidative species involved in the regulation of commensal and pathogenic microflora. Disease may dysregulate redox processes and cause imbalances in the oxidative profile, where typically favoured oxidative species, such as hypochlorous acid (HOCl), result in an overabundance of chlorinated protein residues. As such, the pharmacological capacity of thiocyanate has been recently investigated for its ability to modulate myeloperoxidase activity for HOSCN, a less potent species relative to HOCl, although outcomes vary significantly across different disease models. To date, most studies have focused on therapeutic effects in respiratory and cardiovascular animal models. However, we note other conditions such as rheumatic arthritis where SCN- administration may worsen patient outcomes. Here, we discuss the pathophysiological role of SCN- in diseases where MPO is implicated.","San Gabriel, Patrick T; Liu, Yuyang; Schroder, Angie L; Zoellner, Hans; Chami, Belal",,79,26

On the other hand, the role of respiratory viruses in the pathogenesis of severe respiratory infections is an issue of great importance. The present literature review was aimed at assessing the potential effects of air pollutants on the transmission and severity of respiratory viral infections. We have reviewed the scientific literature regarding the association of outdoor air pollution and respiratory viruses on respiratory diseases. Evidence supports a clear association between air concentrations of some pollutants and human respiratory viruses interacting to adversely affect the respiratory system. Given the undoubted importance and topicality of the subject, we have paid special attention to the association between air pollutants and the transmission and severity of the effects caused by the coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2, which causes the COVID-19. Although to date, and by obvious reasons, the number of studies on this issue are still scarce, most results indicate that chronic exposure to air pollutants delays/complicates recovery of patients of COVID-19 and leads to more severe and lethal forms of this disease. This deserves immediate and in-depth experimental investigations.","Domingo, José L; Rovira, Joaquim",Environ Res,79,20

Such is key knowledge for the authorities to prepare for the health systems demand or to apply restrictions to slow down the infectives curve. Even when the model can be easily solved ---by the use of specialized software or by programming the numerical solution of the differential equations that represent the model---, the prediction is a non-easy task, because the behavioral change of people is reflected in a continuous change of the parameters. A relevant question is what we can use of one city to another; if what happened in Madrid could have been applied to New York and then, if what we have learned from this city would be of use for S\~ao Paulo. With this idea in mind, we present an analysis of a spreading-rate related measure of COVID-19 as a function of population density and population size for all US counties, as long as for Brazilian cities and German cities. Contrary to what is the common hypothesis in epidemics modeling, we observe a higher {\em per-capita} contact rate for higher city's population density and population size. Also, we find that the population size has a more explanatory effect than the population density.

The remodeling of immune response that is observed among the elderly could explain, at least in part, the age gradient in lethality of COVID-19. In this review, we will discuss the phenomenon of immunosenescence, which entails changes that occur in both innate and adaptive immunity with aging. Furthermore, we will discuss inflamm-aging, a low-grade inflammatory state triggered by continuous antigenic stimulation, which may ultimately increase all-cause mortality. In general, the elderly are less capable of responding to neo-antigens, because of lower naïve T cell frequency. Furthermore, they have an expansion of memory T cells with a shrinkage of the T cell diversity repertoire. When infected by SARS-CoV-2, young people present with a milder disease as they frequently clear the virus through an efficient adaptive immune response. Indeed, antibody-secreting cells and follicular helper T cells are thought to be effectively activated in young patients that present a favorable prognosis. In contrast, the elderly are more prone to an uncontrolled activation of innate immune response that leads to cytokine release syndrome and tissue damage. The failure to trigger an effective adaptive immune response in combination with a higher pro-inflammatory tonus may explain why the elderly do not appropriately control viral replication and the potential clinical consequences triggered by a cytokine storm, endothelial injury, and disseminated organ injury. Enhancing the efficacy of the adaptive immune response may be an important issue both for infection resolution as well as for the appropriate generation of immunity upon vaccination, while inhibiting inflamm-aging will likely emerge as a potential complementary therapeutic approach in the management of patients with severe COVID-19.","Cunha, Lucas Leite; Perazzio, Sandro Felix; Azzi, Jamil; Cravedi, Paolo; Riella, Leonardo Vidal",Front Immunol,79,26

This prospective pilot study evaluates perioperative markers of pancreatitis and systemic inflammation to predict clinically relevant grade B/C-POPF (CR-POPF). METHODS: All patients undergoing pancreatic resection from December 2017 to April 2019 were prospectively enrolled. Surgical procedures and outcomes were correlated with perioperative blood markers. ROC analysis was performed to assess their predictive value for CR-POPF. Cut-offs were calculated with the Youden index. RESULTS: In total, 70 patients were analysed (43 pancreatoduodenectomies and 27 distal pancreatectomies). In-hospital/90-d mortality and morbidity were 5.7/7.1% (n = 4/n = 5) and 75.7% (n = 53). Major complications (Clavien-Dindo &#8805; 3a) occurred in 28 (40.0%) patients, CR-POPF in 20 (28.6%) patients. Serum lipase (cut-off > 51U/L) and IL-6 (> 56.5 ng/l) on POD3 were significant predictors for CR-POPF (AUC = 0.799, 95%-CI 0.686-0.912 and AUC = 0.784, 95%-CI 0.668-0.900; combined AUC = 0.858, 95%-CI 0.758-0.958; all p < 0.001). Patients with both or one factor(s) above cut-off more frequently developed CR-POPF than cases without (100 vs. 50% vs. 7.5%, p < 0.001). This also applied for overall and severe complications (p = 0.013 and p = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: Post-operative pancreatitis and inflammatory response are major determinants for development of POPF. A combination of serum lipase and IL-6 on POD3 is a highly significant early predictor of CR-POPF and overall complications, potentially guiding patient management.

PARTICIPANTS: A total of 207 physiotherapists in private practice or community settings and 401 patients aged &#8805; 18 years who consulted (individual and/or group) via videoconference from April to November 2020. METHODS: Separate customised online surveys were developed for physiotherapists and patients. Data were collected regarding the implementation of videoconferencing (cost, software used) and experience with videoconferencing (perceived effectiveness, safety, ease of use and comfort communicating, each scored on a 4-point ordinal scale). Qualitative content analysis was performed of physiotherapists' free-text responses about perceived facilitators, barriers and safety issues. RESULTS: Physiotherapists gave moderate-to-high ratings for the effectiveness of and their satisfaction with videoconferencing. Most intended to continue to offer individual consultations (81%) and group classes (60%) via videoconferencing beyond the pandemic. For individual consultations and group classes, respectively, most patients had moderately or extremely positive perceptions about ease of technology use (94%, 91%), comfort communicating (96%, 86%), satisfaction with management (92%, 93%), satisfaction with privacy/security (98%, 95%), safety (99% both) and effectiveness (83%, 89%). Compared with 68% for group classes, 47% of patients indicated they were moderately or extremely likely to choose videoconferencing for individual consultations in the future. Technology was predominant as both a facilitator and barrier. Falls risk was the main safety factor.

METHOD: This is a cross-sectional study of patients with T1D and laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from 52 clinical sites in the US, data was collected April - August 2020. We examined the distribution of patient factors and DKA events across NH White, NH Black, and Hispanic race/ethnicity groups. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to examine the odds of DKA among NH Black and Hispanic patients with T1D as compared to NH White patients, adjusting for potential confounders, such as age, sex, insurance, and last HbA1c. RESULTS: We included 180 patients with T1D and laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in the analysis. Forty-four percent (n=79) were NH White, 31% (n=55) NH Black, 26% (n=46) Hispanic. NH Blacks and Hispanics had higher median HbA1c than Whites ((%-points) [IQR]:11.7[4.7], p<0.001, and 9.7[3.1] vs. 8.3[2.4], p=0.01). We found that more NH Black and Hispanic presented with DKA compared to Whites (55% and 33% vs. 13%, p<0.001 and p=0.008, respectively). After adjusting for potential confounders, NH Black patients continued to have greater odds of presenting with DKA compared with NH Whites (OR [95%CI]: 3.7 [1.4,10.6]). CONCLUSION: We found that among T1D patients with COVID-19 infection, NH Blacks were more likely to present in DKA compared with NH White patients. Our findings demonstrate additional risk among NH Blacks with T1D and COVID-19.","Ebekozien, Osagie; Agarwal, Shivani; Noor, Nudrat; Neil, Anastasia Albanese O; Wong, Jenise C; Seeherunvong, Tossaporn; Sanchez, Janine; DeSalvo, Daniel; Lyons, Sarah K; Majidi, Shideh; Wood, Jamie R; Acharya, Runa; Aleppo, Grazia; Sumpter, Kathryn M; Cymbaluk, Anna; Shah, Nirali A; Van Name, Michelle; Cruz-Aviles, Lisa; Alonso, Guy Todd; Gallagher, Mary Pat; Sanda, Srinath; Feuer, Alexis Jamie; Cossen, Kristina; Rioles, Nicole; Jones, Nana-Hawa Yayah; Kamboj, Manmohan K; Hirsch, Irl B",J. clin. endocrinol. metab,79,1

One of the intended effects of these NPIs has been to reduce population mobility. Due to the huge costs of implementing these NPIs, it is essential to have a good understanding of their efficacy. Using aggregated mobility data per country, released by Apple and Google we investigated the proportional contribution of NPIs to the magnitude and rate of mobility changes at a multi-national level. NPIs with the greatest impact on the magnitude of mobility change were lockdown measures;declaring a state of emergency;closure of businesses and public services and school closures. NPIs with the greatest effect on the rate of mobility change were implementation of lockdown measures and limitation of public gatherings. As confirmed by chi-square and cluster analysis, separately recorded NPIs like school closure and closure of businesses and public services were closely correlated with each other, both in timing and occurrence. This suggests that the observed significant NPI effects are mixed with and amplified by their correlated NPI measures. We observed direct and similar effects of NPIs on both Apple and Google mobility data. In addition, although Apple and Google data were obtained by different methods they were strongly correlated indicating that they are reflecting overall mobility on a country level. The availability of this data provides an opportunity for governments to build timely, uniform and cost-effective mechanisms to monitor COVID-19 or future pandemic countermeasures.","Snoeijer, B.

Practice recommendations for obstetric anaesthesia: what we have learned thus far,13.429815,9.977065,2020,"BACKGROUND: The current severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic is unprecedented in its impact. It is essential to shed light on patient characteristics that predispose to a more severe disease course. Obesity, defined as a BMI>30 kg/m2, is suggested to be one of these characteristics. However, BMI does not differentiate between fat mass and lean body mass, or the distribution of fat tissue. The aim of the present study was to assess the body composition of COVID-19 patients admitted to the ward or the ICU and identify any associations with severity of disease. METHODS: We performed an observational cross-sectional cohort study. Bioelectric impedance analysis was conducted amongst all confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to the ward or ICU of our hospital in the Netherlands, between April 10 and 17, 2020. Body water measurements and derived values were recalculated to dry weight, using a standard ratio of extracellular water to total body water of 0.38. Data were compared between the ward and ICU patients, and regression models were used to assess the associations between baseline characteristics, body composition, and several indicators of disease severity, including a composite score composed of mortality, morbidity, and ICU admission. RESULTS: Fifty-four patients were included, of which 30 in the ward and 24 in the ICU. The mean age was 67 years (95%-CI 64-71), and 34 (63%) were male. Mean BMI was 29.7 (95%-CI 28.2-31.1) kg/m2 and did not differ between groups. Body composition values were not independently associated with disease severity. In multiple logistic regression analyses, a low phase angle was associated with COVID-19 severity in the composite score (OR 0.299, p = 0.046). CONCLUSION: We found no significant associations between body composition, including fat mass, visceral fat area, and fat-free mass, and disease severity in our population of generally overweight COVID-19 patients. A lower phase angle did increase the odds of severe COVID-19. We believe that factors other than body composition play a more critical role in the development of severe COVID-19.","Moonen, Hanneke Pierre Franciscus Xaverius; van Zanten, Florianne Johanna Louise; Driessen, Luuk; de Smet, Vivienne; Slingerland-Boot, Rianne; Mensink, Marco; van Zanten, Arthur Raymond Hubert",Clin. nutr.

Their breakdown products, isothiocyanates (ITCs), are released following tissue disruption by insect feeding or other mechanical damages [3, 4]. ITCs repel and are toxic to generalist herbivores, while specialist herbivores utilize the volatile ITCs as key signals for localizing host plants [5, 6]. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying detection of ITCs remain open. Here, we report that in the diamondback moth Plutella xylostella, a crucifer specialist, ITCs indeed drive the host preference for Arabidopsis thaliana, and the two olfactory receptors Or35 and Or49 are essential for this behavior. By performing gene expression analyses, we identified 12 (out of 59 in total) female-biased Ors, suggesting their possible involvement in oviposition choice. By ectopically expressing these Ors in Xenopus oocytes and screening their responses with 49 odors (including 13 ITCs, 25 general plant volatiles, and 11 sex pheromone components), we found that Or35 and Or49 responded specifically to three ITCs (iberverin, 4-pentenyl ITC, and phenylethyl ITC). The same ITCs also exhibited highest activity in electroantennogram recordings with female antennae and were the strongest oviposition stimulants. Knocking out either Or35 or Or49 via CRISPR-Cas9 resulted in a reduced oviposition preference for the ITCs, while double Or knockout females lost their ITC preference completely and were unable to choose between wild-type A. thaliana and a conspecific ITC knockout plant. We hence conclude that the ITC-based oviposition preference of the diamondback moth for its host A. thaliana is governed by the cooperation of two highly specific olfactory receptors.","Liu, Xiao-Long; Zhang, Jin; Yan, Qi; Miao, Chun-Li; Han, Wei-Kang; Hou, Wen; Yang, Ke; Hansson, Bill S; Peng, Ying-Chuan; Guo, Jin-Meng; Xu, Hao; Wang, Chen-Zhu; Dong, Shuang-Lin; Knaden, Markus",Curr. biol,79,16

Despite this need, few studies have compared the effectiveness of clinic-based versus web-based or telehealth services. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to compare the clinical outcomes of clinic-based multidisciplinary therapy in an integrated practice unit (C-IPU) model with online integrated multidisciplinary therapy (O-IPU) in individuals undergoing conservative care for LBP. METHODS: A total of 1090 participants were prospectively recruited to participate in a clinical trial registry (NCT04081896) through the SpineZone rehabilitation IPU program. All participants provided informed consent. Participants were allocated to the C-IPU (N=988) or O-IPU (N=102) groups based on their personal preferences. The C-IPU program consisted of a high-intensity machine-based core muscle resistance training program, whereas the O-IPU program consisted of therapist-directed home core strengthening exercises through a web-based platform. Changes in LBP symptom severity (Numeric Pain Rating Scale), disability (Oswestry Disability Index), goal achievement (Patient-Specific Functional Scale), and frequency of opioid use were compared between the C-IPU and O-IPU groups using multivariate linear regression modeling adjusted for age, gender, treatment number, program duration, and baseline pain and disability. RESULTS: Approximately 93.03% (1014/1090) of the participants completed their recommended programs, with no group differences in dropout rates (P=.78). The C-IPU group showed greater pain relief (P<.001) and reductions in disability (P=.002) than the O-IPU group, whereas the O-IPU group reported greater improvements in goal achievement (P<.001). Both programs resulted in reduced opioid use frequency, with 19.0% (188/988) and 21.5% (22/102) of participants reporting cessation of opioid use for C-IPU and O-IPU programs, respectively, leaving only 5.59% (61/1090) of participants reporting opioid use at the end of their treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Both in-clinic and web-based multidisciplinary programs are beneficial in reducing pain, disability, and opioid use and in improving goal achievement. The differences between these self-selected groups shed light on patient characteristics, which require further investigation and could help clinicians optimize these programs.

Vaccination readiness is defined as a set of components that increase or decrease AN individual's likelihood of getting vaccinated. Building on earlier work that distinguished five components of vaccination readiness (confidence, complacency, constraints, calculation, and collective responsibility), we revised the questionnaire used to measure these components to improve its psychometric properties, specifically criterion validity. In doing so, we also developed two new components of vaccination readiness: compliance and conspiracy. Compliance is the tendency to support monitoring to control adherence to regulations;conspiracy is the tendency to endorse conspiratorial beliefs about vaccination.

Among the seven components of the PSQI, sleep quality (P = 0.048) and daytime dysfunction (P = 0.006) in August were significantly improved compared with February, whereas SDS and SAS did not significantly differ among the three different time points. The proportion of patients who received palliative radiotherapy was significantly higher on 18 May than on 17 February (P = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Medical personnel in the Department of Radiotherapy experienced a significantly elevated incidence of sleeping problems during the early COVID-19 outbreak period. Multiple combinations of protective measures to avoid infection could improve sleep quality and ensure the safe delivery of RT to cancer patients.","Chen, Fangjie; Zhan, Wenming; Xu, Hong039; en,; Wu, Ying; Jia, Yongshi; Liang, Xiaodong; Chen, Weijun",Ann.

The pathogenic mechanism of the novel coronavirus is unknown, which presents a significant impediment to the patient rescue. A conserved domain search strategy was utilized in this work to determine that a large number of viral proteins could bind to hemoglobin. S could bind to extracellular hemoglobin. SARS-COV-2 virus proteins interacted with porphyrins. SARS-COV-2 viruses could synthesize heme from porphobilinogen and encode all the similar enzymes required for the process. Both E and ORF3a contained heme-binding sites. ORF3a's Arg134 and E's Cys44 were the heme-iron binding sites, respectively. ORF3a also contained homologous domains to human cytochrome C reductase and bacterial EFeB protein. The molecular docking analysis revealed that ORF3a and ORF8 proteins were shown to be capable of attacking hemoglobin's 1-beta chain, whereas ORF3a was found to be effective in capturing heme for dissociation to iron and porphyrin. Deoxyhemoglobin was more susceptible to viral attack than oxidized hemoglobin. In summary, the combination of viral proteins to porphyrins and their metal compounds would improve the ability to permeate cell membranes and generate oxygen free radicals (ROS). It may be associated with viral infections and epidemic transmission. Viral proteins regulated the production and function of NO, CO and CO2 by inhibiting the activity of hemoglobin, thereby affecting immune cell function. Viral proteins' attack on hemoglobin could result in symptoms such as respiratory distress and blood clotting, damage to numerous organs and tissues, and disruption of normal human heme metabolism.","liu, wenzhong li hualan",,79,16

Most people with COVID-19 have a mild to moderate respiratory illness; others experience severe illness, such as COVID-19 pneumonia. The first and most accessible diagnostic information is from symptoms and signs from clinical examination. Infected patients present with a variety of manifestations. Formal diagnosis requires laboratory analysis of nose and throat samples, or imaging tests like CT scans. Emerging data suggest that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has extrapulmonary manifestations. Sometimes these extra-respiratory manifestations may be the initial or only symptom of COVID-19, prior to fever or respiratory manifestations. In summary, our concise review shows that there is a wide range of symptoms that can be presented by COVID-19 patients. Extra-respiratory manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection have recently been observed in the rapidly increasing number of COVID-19 cases. Considering the broad spectrum of clinical manifestations and the increasing worldwide burden of the disease, there is an urgent need to rapidly scale up the diagnostic capacity to detect COVID-19 and its complications.","Canatan, Duran; Vives Corrons, Joan Lluis; De Sanctis, Vincenzo",Acta Biomed,79,15

To date, no vaccines or specific antiviral drugs have been approved for the treatment of this disease in clinic. Herein, therapeutic antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 were obtained from hyperimmune equine plasma. First, a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) was obtained in gram-level quantities through high-cell density fermentation of Chinese hamster ovary cells. Then, the binding of the RBD to the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, was verified by several biochemical methods. The efficacy of the RBD in triggering antibody response in vivo was subsequently tested in both mice and equines, and the results showed that the RBD triggered high-titer neutralizing antibody production in vivo. Immunoglobulin F(ab')2 fragments were prepared from equine antisera via removal of the Fc region from the immunoglobulins. Finally, a neutralization test with live virus demonstrated that RBD-specific F(ab')2 inhibited SARS-CoV-2 with an EC50 of 0.07 µg/ml and an EC80 of 0.18 µg/ml, showing a potent inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV-2.

There have been concerns throughout the pandemic about patients with underlying chronic lung diseases like Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and asthma. However, there is paucity of data in these patients, especially from a rural setting. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study of 301 patient 18 years and older, admitted with symptomatic COVID-19 infection to 8 Vidant health system hospitals in Eastern North Carolina (ENC) from March 1,2020 to July 15,2020. Primary objective was to assess prevalence of asthma and COPD in patients hospitalized with symptomatic COVID-19. Secondary objectives were to compare need for ICU admission, mechanical ventilation (MV), MV duration, ICU length of stay (LOS), hospital LOS, and mortality between patients with and without COPD and asthma, and between obese and non-obese asthmatics. Nonparametric tests and binary regression analyses were performed as appropriate to analyze differences between clinical covariates of interest. Results: Average age of the sample was 63.5 years (±17.1 years). N= 158 (52.5%) of the patients were females. Majority of the patients were African Americans (n=196, 65%). Most common comorbidities included hypertension (n=230, 76%), diabetes (n=155, 51%) and obesity (n=158, 52%). Prevalence of asthma and COPD was 16% (n=47) and 12% (n=36), respectively. More patients with COPD were admitted to the ICU(n=20, 56%) compared to asthma(n=22, 47%) and those with neither condition(n=85, 38%). Compared to patients with neither condition, COPD was significantly associated with increased risk of ICU admission(OR=2.4,p=0.03,CI=1.1-4.99) whereas asthma was not(OR=1.5,p=0.24,CI=0.77-2.9). There were no significant differences in rates of intubation, MV duration, ICU or hospital LOS, or in-hospital survival(Table 1). Based on a limited sample size, obesity in asthma was not significantly associated with increased risk of ICU admission, intubation, prolonged MV, prolonged hospital or ICU LOS, or mortality (n=33 obese asthmatics, n=14 non-obese asthmatics). Increased risk of mortality was significantly associated with older age (OR=1.04, p=0.003). Kaplan-Meier analyses of survival did not reveal a decrease in in-hospital survival in patients with COPD and asthma. Conclusion: Our study shows that asthma and COPD are among the less common comorbidities of COVID-19. Compared to some other studies, our study does not show worse outcomes for COPD or asthma. Larger cohorts are required to establish predictors of outcomes in these patient populations.","Hafiz, M.; Nalamalapu, S.; Kragel, E.; Pemmaraju, D.; Mercogliano, G. M.; Ledbetter, E.; Obi, O.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this paper is to describe direct support professionals' experiences assisting adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities in accessing virtual and in-person health care during COVID-19. METHODS: A content analysis was conducted on responses obtained from an online questionnaire distributed to 942 direct support professionals in Canada. Descriptive statistics were used to report the type of visits that occurred and open text responses describing these visits were coded. RESULTS: Twenty four percent of direct support professionals reported supporting someone at an in-person medical appointment, 22% reported attending at least one video-based virtual appointment and 58% reported supporting at least one phone based virtual appointment in the first 5 months of the pandemic. They identified several barriers and facilitators with each type of visit which suggests there is no ""single way"" to provide health care to this group, but that optimal care depends on maximizing the fit between the person's abilities, the skill set of direct support professionals and health care providers, and the presenting health care issue.

However, the urgent need to better understand the effects of COVID-19 propelled the creation and operationalization of an integrated data repository. The aim of this research is to chronicle the technical and collaborative efforts underpinning this success. Methods: The COVID-19 Consortium is a pro-bono, cross-industry collaboration with academia, comprising of institutions donating technology, healthcare expertise, and de-identified data. Different types of patient level data from several industry-leading sources were ingested through an automated pipeline comprising source-native ETL (auto-refreshed weekly), privacy-preserving tokenization linking patients across datasets, and granular project-based access. The data and analytical environments were hosted in a dedicated and isolated virtual network to protect data privacy and intellectual property. A third-party certifier safeguarded protection of patient privacy while scientific and pan-stakeholder governance ensured research quality, data security, and operational collaboration. Results: In 2020, approximately 9 terabytes of data, consisting of 5 billion records from 250 million unique persons and 2.1 million patients with COVID-19, from ten different data providers were loaded onto the platform. Data types ingested include medical, pharmacy, and life insurance claims, electronic health records, mortality, consumer, and health propensities. Over 350 academic, scientific, and medical researchers accessed the database and produced 23 publications in medical journals and the media, with over 100 ongoing projects. Topics of research ranged from the public health effects to the socioeconomic effects of COVID-19. Conclusions: The successful deployment of the COVID-19 database is a concrete example of the possibility and potential of integrating disparate datasets for rapid research and can serve as a roadmap for future efforts.","Talwai, A.; Wing, V.; Itzkovich, Y.; Galaznik, A.; Chatterjee, A.; Jain, R.; LaBonte, J.",Value in Health,79,13

In a multivariate logistic regression model, ACE-I/ARB use was independently associated with reduced risk of in-hospital mortality in the entire population (OR, 0.655; 95% CI, 0.505-0.850; P=0.001), AA population (OR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.249-0.779; P=0.005), and non-AA population (OR, 0.748, 95% CI, 0.553-1.012, P=0.06). In the AA population, in-hospital use of ACE-I/ARBs was associated with improved mortality (OR, 0.378; 95% CI, 0.188-0.766; P=0.006) while outpatient use was not (OR, 0.889; 95% CI, 0.375-2.158; P=0.812). When analyzing each medication class separately, ARB in-hospital use was significantly associated with reduced in-hospital mortality in the AA population (OR, 0.196; 95% CI, 0.074-0.516; P=0.001), while ACE-I use was not associated with impact on mortality in any population. Conclusion and Relevance: In-hospital use of ARBs was associated with a significant reduction in in-hospital mortality among COVID-19-positive AA patients. These results support further investigation of ARBs to improve outcomes in AA patients at high risk for COVID-19-related mortality.","Li, S.; Sarangarajan, R.; Jun, T.; Kao, Y.-H.; Wang, Z.; Schadt, E.; Kiebish, M.

Several studies have shown that people who are homeless experience more significant suicidal ideation and behavior than the general population. However, there is limited information about what suicide interventions exist, to what extent they are grounded in robust research, and which intervention components effectively reduce suicidal ideation and behavior in the homeless community. This research aimed to characterise the current evidence base in the area of suicide prevention for homeless individuals. Methods: A scoping review guided by Arksey and O’Malley’s five-stage framework was conducted and a narrative synthesis was performed. Pubmed, EMBASE, PsychInfo, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Open Grey, and Bielefeld Academic Search Engine were searched up to 8 May 2020. Results: A total of 3209 records were identified through database and grey literature searching. Three studies are included in this review. Key outcomes identify suicide intervention prevention programmes; similarities and differences across interventions, and examples of staff training. A quality review of the studies was completed. Conclusion: A stark gap in the evidence of suicide specific prevention interventions targeted at homeless populations.","Murray, Rachael McDonnell; Conroy, Eilis; Connolly, Michelle; Stokes, Diarmuid; Frazer, Kate; Kroll, Thilo",Int J Environ Res Public Health,79,26

As a revision of the classical relative entropy (RE), our metric (1) works equivalently with RE in the case of small k, (2) avoids the degeneracy when some word types are absent in one sequence but not in the other. Experiments on 25 viruses including SARS-CoVs show that our method and RE give exactly the same phylogenetic tree when word length k ⩽ 3 . When k > 3 , our method still works and gets convergent phylogenetic topology but the RE gives degenerate results.","Wang, Jun; Zheng, Xiaoqi",Mathematical Biosciences,79,20

However, its diagnostic efficacy remains unclear. In this study, we searched for diagnostic studies from the Web of Science, PubMed, Embase, CNKI, and Wanfang databases to calculate the pooled diagnostic accuracy measures using bivariate random‐effects model meta‐analysis. As a result, 22 from a total of 1613 articles, including 2282 patients with SARS‐CoV‐2 and 1485 healthy persons or patients without SARS‐CoV‐2, were selected for a meta‐analysis. Pooled sensitivity, specificity, and area under curve of the summary receiver operator curve (SROC) were: (a) 0.85 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.79‐0.90), 0.99 (95% CI: 0.98‐1.00), and 0.99 (95% CI: 0.97‐0.99) for anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2 IgG and (b) 0.74 (95% CI: 0.65‐0.81), 0.99 (95% CI: 0.97‐1.00), and 0.95 (95% CI: 0.93‐0.97) for IgM. A subgroup analysis among detection methods indicated the sensitivity of IgG and IgM using enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay were slightly lower than those using gold immunochromatography assay (GICA) and chemiluminescence immunoassay (P > .05). These results showed that the detection of anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2 IgG and IgM had high diagnostic efficiency to assist the diagnosis of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection.

Our test was compared with three commercial methods, and was used to determine COVID-19 seroprevalence among healthcare workers and outpatients in Minnesota. Methods Seventy-nine plasma and serum samples from 50 patients 4 - 69 days after symptom onset who tested positive by a SARS-CoV-2 PCR method using a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab were used to evaluate our test’s clinical performance. Seropositive samples were analyzed for IgG titers in a follow-up assay. Thirty plasma and serum from 12 patients who tested negative by a SARS-CoV-2 PCR method using a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab and 210 negative pre-pandemic serum samples were also analyzed. Among samples from patients >14 days after symptom onset, the assay had 100% clinical sensitivity and 100% clinical specificity, 100% positive predictive value and 100% negative predictive value. Analytical specificity was 99.8%, indicating minimal cross-reactivity. A screening study was conducted to ascertain COVID-19 seroprevalence among healthcare workers and outpatients in Minnesota. Results Analysis of serum collected between April 13 and May 21, 2020 indicated a COVID-19 seroprevalence of 2.96% among 1,282 healthcare workers and 4.46% among 2,379 outpatients.

This cross-sectional study examined meat and poultry plants to assess possible risk factors. Companies completed a self-administered questionnaire on the work environment and protective measures taken to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection. Multivariable logistic regression analysis adjusted for the possibility to distance at least 1.5 meters, break rules, and employment status was performed to identify risk factors associated with COVID-19 cases. Twenty-two meat and poultry plants with 19,072 employees participated. The prevalence of COVID-19 in the seven plants with more than 10 cases was 12.1% and was highest in the deboning and meat cutting area with 16.1%. A subsample analysis where information on maximal ventilation rate per employee was available revealed an association with the ventilation rate (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 0.996, 95% CI 0.993–0.999). When including temperature as an interaction term in the working area, the association with the ventilation rate did not change. When room temperatures increased, the chance of testing positive for COVID-19 (AOR 0.90 95% CI 0.82–0.99) decreased, and the chance for testing positive for COVID-19for the interaction term (AOR 1.001, 95% CI 1.000–1.003) increased. Employees who work where a minimum distance of less than 1.5 m between workers was the norm had a higher chance of testing positive (AOR 3.61; 95% CI 2.83–4.6). Our results further indicate that climate conditions and low outdoor air flow are factors that can promote the spread of SARS-CoV-2 aerosols. A possible requirement for pandemic mitigation strategies in industrial workplace settings is to increase the ventilation rate.","Pokora, Roman; Kutschbach, Susan; Weigl, Matthias; Braun, Detlef; Epple, Annegret; Lorenz, Eva; Grund, Stefan; Hecht, Juergen; Hollich, Helmut; Rietschel, Peter; Schneider, Frank; Sohmen, Roland; Taylor, Katherine; Dienstbuehl, Isabel",PLoS One,79,1

We evaluated the application of the critical care ultrasonography ORACLE protocol to identify the most frequent alterations and their influence on adverse outcomes, especially those involving the RV (dilatation and dysfunction). METHODS: This cross‐sectional study included 204 adult patients with confirmed COVID‐19 admitted at three centers. Echocardiography and lung ultrasound images were acquired on admission using the ORACLE ultrasonography algorithm. RESULTS: Two‐hundred and four consecutive patients were evaluated: 22 (11.9%) demonstrated a fractional shortening of < 35%; 33 (17.1%) a tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) of < 17 mm; 26 (13.5%) a tricuspid peak systolic S wave tissue Doppler velocity of < 9.5 cm/sec; 69 (37.5%) a RV basal diameter of > 41 mm; 119 (58.3%) a pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) of > 35 mm Hg; and 14 (11%) a TAPSE/PASP ratio of < .31. The in‐hospital mortality rate was 37.6% (n = 71). Multiple logistic regression modeling showed that PASP > 35 mm Hg, RV FS of < 35%, TAPSE < 17 mm, RV S wave < 9.5, and TAPSE/PASP ratio < .31 mm/mm Hg were associated with this outcome. PASP and the TAPSE/PASP ratio had the lowest feasibility of being obtained among the investigators (62.2%). CONCLUSION: The presence of RV dysfunction, pulmonary hypertension, and alteration of the RV–arterial coupling conveys an increased risk of in‐hospital mortality in patients presenting with COVID‐19 upon admission; therefore, searching for these alterations should be routine. These parameters can be obtained quickly and safely with the ORACLE protocol.","Manzur‐Sandoval, Daniel; García‐Cruz, Edgar; Gopar‐Nieto, Rodrigo; Arteaga‐Cárdenas, Gerardo; Rascón‐Sabido, Rafael; Mendoza‐Copa, Gastón; Lazcano‐Díaz, Emmanuel; Barajas‐Campos, Ricardo Leopoldo; Jordán‐Ríos, Antonio; Rodríguez‐Jiménez, Gian Manuel; Martínez, Daniel Sierra‐Lara; Murillo‐Ochoa, Adriana Lizeth; Díaz‐Méndez, Arturo; Bucio‐Reta, Eduardo; Rojas‐Velasco, Gustavo; Baranda‐Tovar, Francisco",Echocardiography,79,3

Understanding the actual human mobility response to such policies remains a challenge owing to the lack of an observed and large-scale dataset describing human mobility during the pandemic. This study uses an integrated dataset, consisting of anonymized and privacy-protected location data from over 150 million monthly active samples in the USA, COVID-19 case data and census population information, to uncover mobility changes during COVID-19 and under the stay-at-home state orders in the USA. The study successfully quantifies human mobility responses with three important metrics: daily average number of trips per person; daily average person-miles travelled; and daily percentage of residents staying at home. The data analytics reveal a spontaneous mobility reduction that occurred regardless of government actions and a ‘floor’ phenomenon, where human mobility reached a lower bound and stopped decreasing soon after each state announced the stay-at-home order. A set of longitudinal models is then developed and confirms that the states' stay-at-home policies have only led to about a 5% reduction in average daily human mobility. Lessons learned from the data analytics and longitudinal models offer valuable insights for government actions in preparation for another COVID-19 surge or another virus outbreak in the future.","Xiong, Chenfeng; Hu, Songhua; Yang, Mofeng; Younes, Hannah; Luo, Weiyu; Ghader, Sepehr; Zhang, Lei",J R Soc Interface,79,20

The cellular process of autophagy — in which compartments bound by double membranes engulf portions of the cytosol and then mature to degrade their cytoplasmic contents — is likely to be one such host-cell response. Several lines of evidence show that both bacteria and viruses are vulnerable to autophagic destruction and that successful pathogens have evolved strategies to avoid autophagy, or to actively subvert its components, to promote their own replication. The molecular mechanisms of the avoidance and subversion of autophagy by microorganisms will be the subject of much future research, not only to study their roles in the replication of these microorganisms, but also because they will provide — as bacteria and viruses so often have — unique tools to study the cellular process itself.","Kirkegaard, Karla; Taylor, Matthew P.; Jackson, William T.",Nat Rev Microbiol,79,24

However, the results of studies on the effect of COVID‐19 on male reproduction are controversial. OBJECTIVE: To summarize current research on the effects of COVID‐19 on male reproduction. METHODS: A systematic review of English literature was performed using PubMed and Ovid Embase up to 18 August 2020. Research articles on the presence of SARS‐CoV‐2 in semen, the effects of the virus on semen parameters and any pathological changes in the testes were evaluated. RESULTS: Fourteen studies were included in this review. Six of 176 survivors (3.4%) and 1 of 13 decedents (7.7%) in 2 of 12 studies were positive for viral RNA in semen and testicular tissue, respectively. After stratification of patient groups, we found that the virus was detected in the relatively early stage of infection, 6–16 days after disease onset, in semen from survivors. Two of 3 studies reported that some participants had substandard semen quality after COVID‐19, and 1 study found that COVID‐19 may impair semen quality in a severity‐related manner. Pathological analyses showed that injuries to the seminiferous tubule occurred in all decedents (N = 11). Another study found that orchitic and testis fibrin microthrombi occurred in patients with fatal disease (100%, N = 2). Scrotal discomfort of orchiepididymitis or spermatic cord inflammation has also been reported in COVID‐19 patients. CONCLUSION: Current studies suggest that semen is rarely considered a carrier of SARS‐CoV‐2 genetic material during the infection period but not in the semen of recovered patients. Fatal COVID‐19 may cause testicular structure damage without the presence of virus.","Yao, Yangcheng; Yuan, Xiaoqiong; Wu, Linjing; Guo, Na; Yin, Li; Li, Yufeng",Andrology,79,24

We hypothesize that Chinese children with KD may possess several unique CAA risks, and the predictive efficacy of multiple scoring systems in Chinese patients are still to be further studied. METHODS: Two hundred and three KD patients were recruited. Using multivariable analysis, independent predictors of CAAs were combined into a scoring system. Subsequently, CAA risks of our patients were evaluated by the newly established scoring system and eight other published scoring systems. RESULTS: Seventeen (8.37%) KD patients were identified as CAAs. The newly established scoring system contained the following 5 independent predictors: days of illness at initial treatment ≥7, redness and swelling of extremities, hematocrit ≤33%, percentage of monocytes ≥8.89%, and procalcitonin ≥0.5 ng/mL. The AUC value of newly established scoring system was 0.685 with a sensitivity of 41.18% and a specificity of 84.41%, higher than Harada score, Egami score, Kobayashi score, Sato score, San Diego score, Formosa score, and Tang score, whereas lower than Hua score. CONCLUSIONS: Days of illness at initial treatment ≥7 and procalcitonin are unique predictors of CAAs in newly established scoring system. Taking into account different identification criteria and analytical methodologies, there is still some heterogeneity among different scoring systems. IMPACT: The newly established scoring system contains the five independent predictors. Days of illness at initial treatment ≥7 and PCT are unique predictors of CAAs in our study, compared with 8 other systems. The AUC value of newly established scoring system is 0.685, similar to Hua score. There is some heterogeneity among different scoring systems.","Liu, Hui Hui; Chen, Wei Xia; Niu, Man Man; Jiang, Qi; Qiu, Zhen; Fan, Guo Zhen; Li, Rui Xue; Mammadov, Goshgar; Wu, Yang Fang; Luo, Huang Huang; Zhang, Dong Dong; Hu, Peng",Pediatr Res,79,20

We used paired t‐tests or χ(2) tests and non‐parametric methods to evaluate the significance of differences in weight‐related outcomes and lifestyles across education levels, between sexes, and before and during COVID‐19 lockdown. The mean body mass index of all participating youths has significantly increased (21.8‐22.6) and in all education subgroups during COVID‐19 lockdown. Increases also occurred in the prevalence of overweight/obesity (21.3%‐25.1%, P < .001) and obesity (10.5% to 12.9%, P < .001) in overall youths, especially in high school and undergraduate students. Their activity patterns had also significantly changed, including the decreased frequency of engaging in active transport, moderate−/vigorous‐intensity housework, leisure‐time moderate−/vigorous‐intensity physical activity, and leisure‐time walking, and the increased sedentary, sleeping, and screen time. Our findings would inform policy‐makers and clinical practitioners of these changes in time, for better policy making and clinical practice.

The three most common pre-existing comorbidities associated with COVID-19-related death are elderly, diabetic, and hypertensive people. A common factor among these risk groups for the outcome of death in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 is dysbiosis, with an increase in the proportion of bacteria with a pro-inflammatory profile. Due to this dysbiosis, elderly, diabetic, and hypertensive people present a higher propensity to mount an inflammatory environment in the gut with poor immune editing, culminating in a weakness of the intestinal permeability barrier and high bacterial product translocation to the bloodstream. This scenario culminates in a low-grade, persistent, and systemic inflammation. In this context, we propose here that high circulating levels of bacterial products, like lipopolysaccharide (LPS), can potentiate the SARS-CoV-2-induced cytokines, including IL-6, being crucial for development of the cytokine storm in the severe form of the disease. A better understanding on the possible correlation between gut dysbiosis and poor outcomes observed in elderly, diabetic, and hypertensive people can be useful for the development of new therapeutic strategies based on modulation of the gut microbiota.","Magalhães, Nathalia Santos; Savino, Wilson; Silva, Patrícia Machado Rodrigues; Martins, Marco Aurélio; Carvalho, Vinicius Frias",Front Med (Lausanne),79,15

This review aims to systematically synthesize the implemented national-level mental health policies released by the Chinese government during the COVID-19 outbreak, and summarize the implementation of those mental health policies. Methods: Six databases and two websites were systematically searched, including published studies and gray literature published between December 1, 2019 and October 29, 2020. Results: A total of 40 studies were included. Among them, 19 were national-level policies on mental health released by the Chinese government, and 21 studies reported data on the implementation of those mental health policies. Mental health policies were issued for COVID-19 patients, suspected cases, medical staff, the general population, patients with mental illness, and mental institutions. In the early stage of the COVID-19 epidemic, attention was paid to psychological crisis intervention. In the later stage of the epidemic, the government focused mainly on psychological rehabilitation. During the COVID-19 outbreak, more than 500 psychiatrists from all over China were sent to Wuhan, about 625 hotlines were notified in 31 provinces, several online psychological consultation platforms were established, social software such as TikTok, Weibo, and WeChat were used for psychological education, and many books on mental health were published. Responding quickly, maximizing the use of resources, and emphasizing the importance of policy evaluation and implementation quality were characteristics of the mental health policies developed during the COVID-19 outbreak. Challenges facing China include a low rate of mental health service utilization, a lack of evaluation data on policy effects, and no existing national-level emergency response system and designated workforce to provide psychological crisis interventions during a national emergency or disaster. Conclusions: This review suggests that China has responded quickly and comprehensively to a possible mental health crisis during the COVID-19 outbreak, appropriate mental health policies were released for different members of the population. As the epidemic situation continues to change, the focus of mental health policies has been adjusted accordingly. However, we should note that there has been a lack of separate policies for specific mental health issues during the COVID-19 outbreak.","Qiu, Dan; Li, Yilu; Li, Ling; He, Jun; Ouyang, Feiyun; Xiao, Shuiyuan",Front Psychiatry,79,4

We evaluated clinical outcome data of two hospitals that agreed on a predefined protocol for restrictive use of invasive ventilation where the decision to intubate was based on the clinical presentation and oxygen content rather than on the degree of hypoxemia. METHOD: Data analysis of patients with positive PCR-testing for SARS-CoV-2, typical history, and symptoms and pulmonary infiltrates who exhibited oxygen saturation values of less than 93%. RESULTS: We identified 78 patients who met the inclusion criteria. The SaO2 nadir was 84.4±6.5% for the whole group. Fifty-three patients (68%) received nasal oxygen (group1), 17 patients (22%) were treated with nasal high-flow, CPAP, non-invasive ventilation, or a combination thereof (group 2) and 8 patients (10%) were intubated (group 3). The Horovitz index was 216±8 for group 1, 157±13 for group 2, and 106±15 for group 3. Oxygen content was 14.5±2.5, 13.4±1.9, and 11.6±2.6 mL·dL(−1) for the three respective groups. Overall mortality was 7.7%, the mortality of intubated patients was 50%. 93% of patients could be discharged on room air. CONCLUSION: Permissive hypoxemia where decisions for the level of respiratory therapy were based on the clinical presentation and oxygen content resulted in low intubation rates, low overall mortality, and a low number of patients who require oxygen after discharge.","Voshaar, Thomas; Stais, Patrick; Köhler, Dieter; Dellweg, Dominic",ERJ Open Res,79,16

These are abundantly found in plants, animals and many other species and are known to agglutinate various blood groups of erythrocytes. Further, due to the unique carbohydrate recognition property, lectins have been extensively used in many biological functions that make use of protein-carbohydrate recognition like detection, isolation and characterization of glycoconjugates, histochemistry of cells and tissues, tumor cell recognition and many more. In this review, we have summarized the immunomodulatory effects of plant lectins and their effects against diseases, including antimicrobial action. We found that many plant lectins mediate its microbicidal activity by triggering host immune responses that result in the release of several cytokines followed by activation of effector mechanism. Moreover, certain lectins also enhance the phagocytic activity of macrophages during microbial infections. Lectins along with heat killed microbes can act as vaccine to provide long term protection from deadly microbes. Hence, lectin based therapy can be used as a better substitute to fight microbial diseases efficiently in future.","Mishra, Abtar; Behura, Assirbad; Mawatwal, Shradha; Kumar, Ashish; Naik, Lincoln; Mohanty, Subhashree Subhasmita; Manna, Debraj; Dokania, Puja; Mishra, Amit; Patra, Samir K.; Dhiman, Rohan",Food Chem Toxicol,79,22

Objectives: We aimed to determine the prevalence of early bacterial identification in intubated patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia, as compared with influenza pneumonia, and to characterize its microbiology and impact on outcomes. Methods: A multicenter retrospective European cohort was performed in 36 ICUs. All adult patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation >48 hours were eligible if they had SARS-CoV-2 or influenza pneumonia at ICU admission. Bacterial identification was defined by a positive bacterial culture within 48 hours after intubation in endotracheal aspirates, BAL, blood cultures, or a positive pneumococcal or legionella urinary antigen test. Measurements and Main Results: A total of 1,050 patients were included (568 in SARS-CoV-2 and 482 in influenza groups). The prevalence of bacterial identification was significantly lower in patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia compared with patients with influenza pneumonia (9.7 vs. 33.6%; unadjusted odds ratio, 0.21; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.15–0.30; adjusted odds ratio, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.16–0.33; P < 0.0001).

This limits our ability to quantify the impact of interventions on viral transmission. Here, we develop data-driven viral dynamic models of SARS-CoV-2 infection and estimate key within-host parameters such as the infected cell half-life and the within-host reproductive number. We then develop a model linking VL to infectiousness, showing that a person’s infectiousness increases sub-linearly with VL. We show that the logarithm of the VL in the upper respiratory tract (URT) is a better surrogate of infectiousness than the VL itself. Using data on VL and the predicted infectiousness, we further incorporated data on antigen and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests and compared their usefulness in detecting infection and preventing transmission. We found that RT-PCR tests perform better than antigen tests assuming equal testing frequency; however, more frequent antigen testing may perform equally well with RT-PCR tests at a lower cost, but with many more false-negative tests. Overall, our models provide a quantitative framework for inferring the impact of therapeutics and vaccines that lower VL on the infectiousness of individuals and for evaluating rapid testing strategies.","Ke, Ruian; Zitzmann, Carolin; Ho, David D.; Ribeiro, Ruy M.; Perelson, Alan S.",medRxiv,79,16

However, ex vivo MSC expansion using serum poses risks of harmful immune responses or unknown pathogen infections in the recipients. Therefore, MSCs cultured in serum-free media (SF-MSCs) are ideal for clinical settings; however, their efficacy in pulmonary fibrosis is unknown. Here, we investigated the effects of SF-MSCs on bleomycin-induced pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis compared to those of MSCs cultured in serum-containing media (S-MSCs). METHODS: SF-MSCs and S-MSCs were characterized in vitro using RNA sequence analysis. The in vivo kinetics and efficacy of SF-MSC therapy were investigated using a murine model of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. For normally distributed data, Student’s t test and one-way repeated measures analysis of variance followed by post hoc Tukey’s test were used for comparison between two groups and multiple groups, respectively. For non-normally distributed data, Kruskal–Wallis and Mann–Whitney U tests were used for comparison between groups, using e Bonferroni’s correction for multiple comparisons. All tests were two-sided, and P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Serum-free media promoted human bone marrow-derived MSC expansion and improved lung engraftment of intravenously administered MSCs in recipient mice. SF-MSCs inhibited the reduction in serum transforming growth factor-β1 and the increase of interleukin-6 in both the serum and the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid during bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. SF-MSC administration increased the numbers of regulatory T cells (Tregs) in the blood and lungs more strongly than in S-MSC administration. Furthermore, SF-MSCs demonstrated enhanced antifibrotic effects on bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis, which were diminished by antibody-mediated Treg depletion. CONCLUSIONS: SF-MSCs significantly suppressed BLM-induced pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis through enhanced induction of Tregs into the lungs and corrected the dysregulated cytokine balance. Therefore, SF-MSCs could be a useful tool for preventing pulmonary fibrosis progression without the demerits of serum use.

Health professionals are well placed to promote community-based PA but there is little supporting implementation research. We aimed to explore physiotherapists’ knowledge, views, attitudes and experiences regarding the promotion of physical activity, exercise and sport within daily clinical practice in order to guide development of strategies to support implementation of PA promotion by physiotherapists, in particular those treating older people, and adults and children with a disability. We conducted interviews and focus groups with 39 physiotherapists. Two researchers coded transcripts with an iterative coding approach. Analysis returned five main themes: putting principles into practice; working with conflicting priorities; multiple client barriers; connections build confidence; and the battle for information. The physiotherapists accepted their legitimate role in PA promotion. Limited clinical and administrative time and acute treatment priorities often superseded PA promotion but the lack of updated information regarding suitable community-based PA opportunities and lack of trust in community providers were the biggest barriers. Strategies to enhance PA promotion by physiotherapists should address time and information constraints, and build partnership connections between health professionals and community-based PA providers.","West, Kerry; Purcell, Kate; Haynes, Abby; Taylor, Jennifer; Hassett, Leanne; Sherrington, Catherine",Int J Environ Res Public Health,79,20

On March 11, 2020, COVID-19 was categorized by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a pandemic infection, and by March 18, 2020, it has spread to 146 countries. The first internal defense line against numerous diseases is personalized immunity. Although it cannot be claimed that personalized nutrition will have an immediate impact on a global pandemic, as the nutritional interventions required a long time to induce beneficial outcomes on immunity development, nutritional strategies are still able to clarify and have a beneficial influence on the interplay between physiology and diet, which could make a positive contribution to the condition in the next period. As such, a specific goal for every practitioner is to evaluate different tests to perceive the status of the patient, such as markers of inflammation, insulin regulation, and nutrient status, and to detect possible imbalances or deficiencies. During the process of disease development, the supplementation and addition of different nutrients and nutraceuticals can influence not only the viral replication but also the cellular mechanisms. It is essential to understand that every patient has its individual needs. Even though many nutrients, nutraceuticals, and drugs have beneficial effects on the immune response and can prevent or ameliorate viral infections, it is essential to detect at what stage in COVID-19 progression the patient is at the moment and decide what kind of nutrition intervention is necessary. Furthermore, understanding the pathogenesis of coronavirus infection is critical to make proper recommendations.","Alagawany, Mahmoud; Attia, Youssef A.; Farag, Mayada R.; Elnesr, Shaaban S.; Nagadi, Sameer A.; Shafi, Manal E.; Khafaga, Asmaa F.; Ohran, Husein; Alaqil, Abdulaziz A.; Abd El-Hack, Mohamed E.",Front Vet Sci,79,1

Fear of infection, national lockdowns and altered healthcare priorities have the potential to impact utilisation of healthcare resources for non-communicable diseases. To survey health professionals’ views of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the rate and timing of admission of patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) administered an internet-based questionnaire to cardiologists and cardiovascular nurses across 6 continents. METHODS AND RESULTS: 3101 responses were received from 141 countries across 6 continents. 88.3% responded that their country was in “total lockdown” and 7.1% in partial lockdown. 78.8% responded that the number of patients presenting with STEMI was reduced since the coronavirus outbreak and 65.2% indicated that the reduction in STEMI presentations was >40%. Approximately 60% of all respondents reported that STEMI patients presented later than usual and 58.5% that >40% of STEMI patients admitted to hospital presented beyond the optimal window for primary percutaneous intervention (PCI) or thrombolysis. Independent predictors of the reported higher rate of delayed STEMI presentation were a country in total lockdown, >100 COVID-19 cases admitted locally, and the complete restructuring of the local cardiology service. CONCLUSION: The survey indicates that the impact of COVID-19 on STEMI presentations is likely to be substantial, with both lower presentations and a higher rate of delayed presentations occurring. This has potentially important ramifications for future healthcare and policy planning in the event of further waves of this pandemic.","Pessoa-Amorim, Guilherme; Camm, Christian F; Gajendragadkar, Parag; De Maria, Giovanni Luigi; Arsac, Celine; Laroche, Cecile; Zamorano, José Luis; Weidinger, Franz; Achenbach, Stephan; Maggioni, Aldo P; Gale, Chris P; Poppas, Athena; Casadei, Barbara",Eur Heart J Qual Care Clin Outcomes,79,33

METHODS: : A web-based survey (Google forms questionnaire) spread via professional and scientific associations, professional WhatsApp and email lists, following a snowball technique was used. Data were collected from May 11th and May 31st, 2020 RESULTS: : A total of 1407 subjects were included in final analyses. 24.7% (348 out of 1407) of HCWs reported symptoms of acute stress (SARS-Q measurement) and 53.6% (754 out of 1407) reported symptoms related to poorer general health (GHQ-28 measurement). A higher risk of having an acute stress disorder was associated to being female, not having access to protective material, and several subjects´ perceived risks. Additionally, poorer overall general health (GHQ>24) was related to being female, working in a geographical area with a high incidence of infection, not being listened to by your co-workers, having a greater perception of stress at work and being able to transmit the infection to others. LIMITATIONS: : We must consider a likely memory bias. CONCLUSION: : The high prevalence of affective and general health symptoms among the HCWs and the critical influence of organizational issues and subjects´ perceived risk should lead health authorities to design future strategies to protect health professional force for facing a potential upcoming epidemiological crisis.","Gonzalo, Rodriguez-Menéndez; Ana, Rubio-García; Patricia, Conde-Alvarez; Laura, Armesto-Luque; Nathalia, Garrido-Torres; Luis, Capitan; Asuncion, Luque; Miguel, Ruiz-Veguilla; Benedicto, Crespo-Facorro",J Affect Disord,79,1

The safety and feasibility of ventilator sharing is unknown. METHODS: A single ventilator in pressure control mode was used with flow control valves to simultaneously ventilate two patients with different lung compliances. The system was first evaluated using high-fidelity human patient simulator mannequins and then tested for 1 h in two pairs of COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory failure. Patients were matched on positive end-expiratory pressure, fractional inspired oxygen tension, and respiratory rate. Tidal volume and peak airway pressure (P(MAX)) were recorded from each patient using separate independent spirometers and arterial blood gas samples drawn at 0, 30, and 60 min. The authors assessed acid-base status, oxygenation, tidal volume, and P(MAX) for each patient. Stability was assessed by calculating the coefficient of variation. RESULTS: The valves performed as expected in simulation, providing a stable tidal volume of 400 ml each to two mannequins with compliance ratios varying from 20:20 to 20:90 ml/cm H(2)O. The system was then tested in two pairs of patients. Pair 1 was a 49-yr-old woman, ideal body weight 46 kg, and a 55-yr-old man, ideal body weight 64 kg, with lung compliance 27 ml/cm H(2)O versus 35 ml/cm H(2)O. The coefficient of variation for tidal volume was 0.2 to 1.7%, and for P(MAX) 0 to 1.1%. Pair 2 was a 32-yr-old man, ideal body weight 62 kg, and a 56-yr-old woman, ideal body weight 46 kg, with lung compliance 12 ml/cm H(2)O versus 21 ml/cm H(2)O. The coefficient of variation for tidal volume was 0.4 to 5.6%, and for P(MAX) 0 to 2.1%. CONCLUSIONS: Differential ventilation using a single ventilator is feasible. Flow control valves enable delivery of stable tidal volume and P(MAX) similar to those provided by individual ventilators.","Levin, Matthew A.; Shah, Anjan; Shah, Ronak; Kane, Erica; Zhou, George; Eisenkraft, James B.; Chen, Martin D.",Anesthesiology,79,29

However, the course of this disease in immunosuppressed patients remains unknown. This study aimed to describe the course of COVID‐19 infection and its effects on lung transplant recipients. METHODS: This was a single‐center, retrospective, observational study. The recipients with suspicious symptoms and/or a contact history with infected individuals were diagnosed with COVID‐19 by performing a reverse transcription‐polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) test using samples obtained from the nasopharynx swabs or bronchial lavage. We classified the patients into mild, moderate, and high severity groups according to their clinical conditions. In patients with positive RT‐PCR results, cell cycle inhibitor drugs were withdrawn, while steroids were maintained at the same level as in patients without clinical deterioration. RESULTS: Of the seven recipients diagnosed with COVID‐19 infection, one experienced a re‐infection. Each recipient had at least one comorbidity. Smell disorder (12.5%), cough/dyspnea (37%), and fever/chills/shivering (37%) were the most frequent symptoms. The mean follow‐up time after infection was 108 days. No deaths were recorded due to COVID‐19; however, the pulmonary function test values of two recipients were decreased during subsequent follow‐ups. CONCLUSION: In our small group of transplant recipients with COVID‐19, there were two cases of pulmonary function deterioration and a case of re‐infection, and no recipient died. It is suggested that steroid therapy should be initiated in the early period in patients with pulmonary opacities.","Turkkan, Sinan; Beyoglu, Muhammet Ali; Sahin, Mehmet Furkan; Yazicioglu, Alkın; Tezer Tekce, Yasemin; Yekeler, Erdal",Transpl Infect Dis,79,20

The generation of biogas from the massive quantity of agricultural waste biomass is one of the critical drivers of the circular economy. Biogas has enormous renewable energy potential and has multitudes of applications in today’s energy-intensive society. Oil cakes, a known Agri-waste, are the by-product of oil processing, and are rich in nutrients. The edible oil cakes mostly have been used as a cattle feed; however, non-edible oil cakes do not find many applications. Their production is continuously escalating as non-edible oils are increasingly used in biodiesel production. Recently, there is a lot of emphasis on biogas production from these oil cakes. This paper reviews in detail biogas production from both edible and non-edible oil cakes. Chemical composition and various other applications of the cakes are also reviewed in brief. The survey illustrates that multiple parameters such as inoculum sources, co-digestion and reactor design affect the biogas production. All those factors, along with biogas upgrading and the economy of the process, are reviewed. Finally, future research opportunities are suggested to improve the viability of the biogas production from oil cakes.","Mohanty, Anee; Rout, Prangya Ranjan; Dubey, Bipro; Meena, Sumer Singh; Pal, Parimal; Goel, Mukesh",Biomass Convers Biorefin,79,29

Despite the nationwide use of attenuated and inactivated vaccines, the outbreak of PED is still a major problem in the swine industry. Virus-like particles (VLPs) are artificial nanoparticles similar to viruses that are devoid of genetic material and are unable to replicate. VLPs have good safety profiles and elicit robust cellular and humoral immune responses. Here, we generated PED VLPs in eukaryotic cells and examined their immune responses in mice. We found that the M protein is essential for the formation of PED VLPs. Interestingly, PED VLP formation was decreased in the presence of E proteins and increased in the presence of N proteins. Both IgG and IgA antibodies were induced in mice immunized with PED VLPs. Moreover, these antibodies protected against PED virus infection in Vero cells. PED VLPs immunization induced Th2-dominant immune responses in mice.

Methods: Patients with chronic HF presenting either in-person or virtually were approached to complete a ten question, anonymous, voluntary survey. Acutely decompensated patients and heart transplant recipients were excluded. Results: 109 patients completed the survey. Average age was 62 ± 14 years, 67% were male, and 59% had HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Overall, patients were worried about contracting COVID-19 and believed they were prone to more severe infection given their underlying HF. However, they were not hesitant to initiate healthcare contact for symptoms and preferred in-person appointments over virtual visits. Although the difference did not reach statistical significance, female patients and those with HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) were more concerned. Conclusions: Patients with HF are concerned about their increased risk of contracting COVID-19.

Viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp) play essential roles in viral RNA synthesis, and thus remains the target of choice for the prophylactic or curative treatment of several viral diseases, due to high sequence and structural conservation. To date, the most promising broad-spectrum class of viral RdRp inhibitors are nucleoside analogues (NAs), with over 25 approved for the treatment of several medically important viral diseases. However, Coronaviruses stand out as a particularly challenging case for NA drug design due to the presence of an exonuclease (ExoN) domain capable of excising incorporated NAs and thus providing resistance to many of these available antivirals. Here we use the available structures of the SARS-CoV RdRp and ExoN proteins, as well as Lassa virus N exonuclease to derive models of catalytically competent SARS-CoV-2 enzymes. We then map a promising NA candidate, GS-441524 (the active metabolite of Remdesivir) to the nucleoside active site of both proteins, identifying the residues important for nucleotide recognition, discrimination, and excision. Interestingly, GS-441524 addresses both enzyme active sites in a manner consistent with significant incorporation, delayed chain termination, and altered excision due to the ribose 1'-CN group, which may account for the increased antiviral effect compared to other available analogues. Additionally, we propose structural and function implications of two previously identified RdRp resistance mutations in relation to resistance against Remdesivir. This study highlights the importance of considering the balance between incorporation and excision properties of NAs between the RdRp and ExoN.","Shannon, Ashleigh; Tuyet Le, Nhung Thi; Selisko, Barbara; Eydoux, Cecilia; Alvarez, Karine; Guillemot, Jean-Claude; Decroly, Etienne; Peersen, Olve; Ferron, Francois; Canard, Bruno",Antiviral Res,79,1

It was found that health care system distrust and health literacy were the most important variables that had an impact on vaccine hesitancy. Based on the mediation analysis, the total effect of health care system distrust on vaccine hesitancy was statistically significant. Participants who held a low level of health literacy and a high perception of the health care system distrust experienced more vaccine hesitancy. The findings suggested the health literacy mediated the relationship between health care system distrust and vaccine hesitancy.

The teletraining component includes 20 sessions of synchronous training sessions of dual tasking, yoga, and Pilates exercises designed and customized for a range of functional levels. Teletraining lasts 12 weeks and participants are instructed to continue exercising for a posttraining period of 9 months. RESULTS: The protocol modifications were supported with supplemental funding (from the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute) and approved by the University Institutional Review Board for Human Use. At the time nonessential research visits were halted by the university, there were 759 people enrolled and baseline tested, accounting for 92.5% of our baseline testing completion target (N=820). Specifically, 325 participants completed the 12-week intervention and follow-up testing visits, and 289 participants needed to complete either the intervention or follow-up assessments. A modified analysis plan will include sensitivity analyses to ensure the robustness of the study results in the presence of uncertainty and protocol deviations. Study results are projected to be published in 2021. CONCLUSIONS: This modified remote teleassessment/teletraining protocol will impact a large number of participants with MS who would otherwise have been discontinued from the study.

The study was undertaken to explore the impact of medicines shortages on patients in Pakistan. The study also identified barriers which hinder the solutions of medicines shortages issue. METHODS: A qualitative study design was adopted and the data was collected in stages between July and September 2019using an in-depth interview approach. The purposive and convenient sampling strategy was used to recruit the study participants. Sample size was limited by using the saturation point criteria. All interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: A total of 35 stakeholders including 13 physicians, 12 pharmacists and 10 patients participated in the study. The findings of the study were classified into five key themes and seven subthemes. The five themes included, ‘impact of medicine shortages on patients’, ‘patients’ practices in response to medicine shortages’, ‘influence of medicines shortages on medical practice or pharmaceutical business’, ‘barriers to solutions for medicines shortages’, and ‘suggestions to assuage the impact of medicine shortages.’This study showed that the medicine shortages had significant clinical and financial impact on patients. Patients’ opted for a number of risk-prone practices to avoid treatment disruption during shortages. An array of pharmaceutical market, medicines quality and patient related factors refrain physicians to switch from brand name medicine to generics and lead to ineffective management of medicines shortages. Promotion of generic prescription, implementation of punitive policies and proper patient consultation was advised to assuage the impact of medicine shortages on patients. CONCLUSION: The adverse clinical, economic and humanistic impact affirmed in this study demand the introduction of risk-management strategies for medicines shortages in hospital and community settings in accordance with the international standards. Promotion of effective patient counselling by the healthcare professionals to deter risk-prone practices associated with medicines shortages is mandatory.

Rapid antigen-detection tests are faster and less expensive; however, the reliability of these tests must be validated before they can be used widely. The objective of this study was to determine the performance of the Panbio(TM) COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test Device (PanbioRT) (Abbott) for SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swab specimens. METHODS: This prospective multicenter study was carried out in ten Spanish university hospitals including individuals with clinical symptoms or epidemiological criteria for COVID-19. Only individuals with ≤ 7 days from the onset of symptoms or from exposure to a confirmed case of COVID-19 were included. Two nasopharyngeal samples were taken to perform the PanbioRT, as a point-of-care test, and a diagnostic RT-PCR test. RESULTS: Among the 958 patients studied, 325 (90.5%) had true-positives results. The overall sensitivity and specificity for the PanbioRT were 90.5% (CI 95%: 87.5-93.6) and 98.8% (CI 95%: 98-99.7), respectively. Sensitivity in participants who had a C(T) <25 for the RT-PCR test was 99.5% (CI 95%: 98.4-100), and in participants with ≤5 days of the clinical course was 91.8% (CI 95%: 88.8-94.8). Agreement between techniques was 95.7% (kappa score: 0.90; CI 95%: 0.88–0.93). CONCLUSIONS: The PanbioRT provides good clinical performance, with even more reliable results for patients with a shorter clinical course of the disease or a higher viral load. The results must be interpreted based on the local epidemiological context.","Merino, Paloma; Guinea, Jesús; Muñoz-Gallego, Irene; González-Donapetry, Patricia; Galán, Juan Carlos; Antona, Nerea; Cilla, Gustavo; Hernáez-Crespo, Silvia; Díaz-de Tuesta, José Luis; Torrella, Ana Gual-de; González-Romo, Fernando; Escribano, Pilar; Sánchez-Castellano, Miguel Ángel; Sota-Busselo, Mercedes; Delgado-Iribarren, Alberto; García, Julio; Cantón, Rafael; Muñoz, Patricia; Folgueira, María Dolores; Cuenca-Estrella, Manuel; Oteo-Iglesias, Jesús; Medrano, Sara; Pérez, Alba; Galar, Alicia; Martínez-Expósito, Oscar; Alejo-Cancho, Izaskun; Martín-Higuera, M.

We performed a meta‐analysis to determine the pooled prevalence of outcomes among hospitalized LTx recipients with COVID‐19. A database search of literature published between December 1, 2019, and November 20, 2020, was performed per PRISMA guidelines. Twelve studies comprising 517 hospitalized LTx recipients with COVID‐19 were analyzed. Common presenting symptoms were fever (71%), cough (62%), dyspnea (48%), and diarrhea (28%). Approximately 77% (95% CI, 61%‐93%) of LTx recipients had a history of liver cirrhosis. The most prevalent comorbidities were hypertension (55%), diabetes (45%), and cardiac disease (21%). In‐hospital mortality was 20% (95% CI, 13%‐28%) and rose to 41% (95% CI, 19%‐63%) (P < 0.00) with ICU admission. Additional subgroup analysis demonstrated a higher mortality risk in the elderly (>60‐65 years) (OR 4.26; 95% CI, 2.14‐8.49). There was no correlation in respect to sex or time since transplant. In summary, LTx recipients with COVID‐19 had a high prevalence of dyspnea and gastrointestinal symptoms. In‐hospital mortality was comparable to non‐transplant populations with similar comorbidities but appeared to be less than what is reported elsewhere for cirrhotic patients (26%‐40%). Importantly, the observed high case fatality in the elderly could be due to age‐associated comorbidities.","Jayant, Kumar; Reccia, Isabella; Virdis, Francesco; Pyda, Jordan S.; Bachul, Piotr J.; di Sabato, Diego; Barth, Rolf N.; Fung, John; Baker, Talia; Witkowski, Piotr",Clin Transplant,79,1

This study intended to assess the effectiveness of a mixed media education intervention to enhance nursing students' knowledge, attitude, and compliance with SPs. METHOD: A randomized controlled trial with 84 nursing students was conducted in a teaching hospital in Hubei, China. The intervention group (n = 42) attended 3 biweekly mixed media education sessions, consisting of lectures, videos, role-play, and feedback with 15-20 minutes of individual online supervision and feedback sessions following each class. The control group learned the same material through self-directed readings. Pre- and posttest assessments of knowledge, attitudes, and compliance were assessed with the Knowledge with Standard Precautions Questionnaire, Attitude with Standard Precautions Scale, and the Compliance with Standard Precautions Scale, respectively. The Standard Bacterial Colony Index was used to assess handwashing effectiveness. RESULTS: At 6-week follow-up, performance on the Knowledge with Standard Precautions Questionnaire, Attitude with Standard Precautions Scale, and Compliance with Standard Precautions Scale were significantly improved in the intervention group compared with the control group (P < .01).

The goal of this review is to discuss acute and chronic cough syndromes caused by non-asthmatic airway diseases. RECENT FINDINGS: Acute cough syndrome is short-lived and self-limited. Acute bronchitis and diffuse acute infectious bronchiolitis (DAIB) are examples. The former is usually caused by a viral illness; the latter by Mycoplasma pneumoniae, influenza, and Haemophilus influenzae. Causes of chronic cough in the adult include chronic bronchitis, non-infectious bronchiolitis, and non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis. SUMMARY: Supportive measures are recommended for acute bronchitis and antibiotic use is discouraged. Antibiotics may be needed for DAIB. Smoking cessation and bronchodilators can control cough in chronic bronchitis. Therapeutic approaches for non-infectious bronchiolitis depend on the varied etiology. The hallmark of bronchiectasis is a chronic infection of the airways, and antibiotics, mucus clearance measures, and bronchodilators are all supportive.","Braman, Sidney S.; Poor, Armeen",Curr Otorhinolaryngol Rep,79,26

This study provides information on the survivability of PEDV across common swine feed ingredients in the presence or absence of the liquid antimicrobial. RESULTS: Eighteen ingredients commonly included in commercial swine diets were selected, including 3 grain sources (corn, soybean meal (SBM), dried distillers grains with solubles (DDGS)), 5 porcine by-products (spray-dried plasma, purified plasma, intestinal mucosa, meat and bone meal and red blood cells (RBCs)), 3 vitamin/trace mineral (VTM) mixes (sow, nursery, finishing), 2 fat sources (choice white grease and soy oil), 3 synthetic amino acids (lysine HCL, D/L methionine, threonine), as well as limestone and dry choline chloride. Complete feed and stock PEDV served as controls. Thirty grams of each ingredient were inoculated with 2 mL PEDV. A matched set of samples were treated with the formaldehyde-based liquid antimicrobial SalCURB® (LA). All samples (n = 320) were stored outdoors under winter time ambient conditions for 30 days. Samples were submitted on 1, 7, 14 and 30 days post-inoculation (DPI) and tested by PCR and virus isolation (VI). All VI-negative samples were tested by swine bioassay. Viable PEDV was detected by VI or swine bioassay at 1, 7, 14 and 30 DPI from SBM, DDGS, meat & bone meal, RBCs, lysine HCL, D/L methionine, choice white grease, choline chloride, complete feed and stock virus control and at 7 DPI in limestone and at 14 DPI in threonine. Supplementary testing of complete feed and SBM indicated viable virus out to 45 and 180 DPI, respectively. All other samples were negative by VI and bioassay. In contrast, treatment with LA inactivated PEDV across all ingredients on 1 DPI and induced RNA reduction over time. CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions of this study, PEDV viability in feed was influenced by ingredient with extended survival in SBM. Furthermore, LA treatment rendered virus inactive, independent of ingredient type.","Dee, Scott; Neill, Casey; Clement, Travis; Singrey, Aaron; Christopher-Hennings, Jane; Nelson, Eric",Porcine Health Manag,79,33

It affected economies, stopped travel, and isolated individuals and populations around the world. Wildlife, especially bats, serve as reservoirs of coronaviruses from which the variant Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged that causes COVID-19. In this review, we describe the current knowledge on COVID-19 and the significance of wildlife hosts in its emergence. Mammalian and avian coronaviruses have diverse host ranges with distinct lineages of coronaviruses. Recombination and reassortments occur more frequently in mixed-animal markets where diverse viral genotypes intermingle. Human coronaviruses have evolved through gene gains and losses primarily in interfaces where wildlife and humans come in frequent contact. There is a gap in our understanding of bats as reservoirs of coronaviruses and there is a misconception that bats periodically transmit coronaviruses to humans. Future research should investigate bat viral diversity and loads at interfaces between humans and bats. Furthermore, there is an urgent need to evaluate viral strains circulating in mixed animal markets, where the coronaviruses circulated before becoming adapted to humans. We propose and discuss a management intervention plan for COVID-19 and raise questions on the suitability of current containment plans. We anticipate that more virulent coronaviruses could emerge unless proper measures are taken to limit interactions between diverse wildlife and humans in wild animal markets.","Perveen, Nighat; Bin Muzaffar, Sabir; Ali Al-Deeb, Mohammad",Saudi J Biol Sci,79,16

In this study, Swedish practitioners (N =10), including police officers, forensic pathologists, prosecutors, defense counsels and judges, participated in an online survey in which they gave their views on the pandemic’s impact on their work situations. The overall results show that the major impact was on their work methods, with transitions to using more online methods and increased remote working, while the smallest impact was noted in relation to work character, including crime and evidence types which have remained relatively constant. Forensic pathologists reported the largest impact on work quality, although there was large individual variation in their responses. On a general level, the practitioners perceived that the measures undertaken at their work places were relatively sufficient and also perceived of the risk of contracting or spreading the virus as relatively low but also this was associated with large individual variation.

The present study aimed to carry out and discover asymptomatic infected individuals in Shenzhen, China. The data will provide the control measures to stop COVID-19 prevalence. Methods: The study was a retrospective review of medical records from 462 confirmed patients with COVID-19 and 45 asymptomatic infected individuals in Shenzhen from January 19 to April 30, 2020; this is a retrospective, observational multicenter study. Results: A total of 462 confirmed cases were diagnosed in Shenzhen from January 19 to April 30, 2020. The cohort included 423 domestic cases (91.56%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 88.67-93.76) and 39 (8.44%, 95% CI: 6.24-11.33) imported cases from other countries.

Healthcare facilities had to set up logistics to avoid being drained while facing a catastrophic health problem. There are currently no available vaccines or perfect therapies and also no certified immunity against that disease. Therefore, it is probable that healthcare systems will face it for an exceptionally long period. That will have a grave effect on the strategy of daily practice of different specialties' services at healthcare centers. Impossible decisions in usual workdays are now forcibly adopted for the sake of patients, care providers, and health resources. METHODS: We try in a simple way to share tertiary center expertise in managing neurosurgical cases amid a dreadful healthcare crisis. Healthcare workers' safety and patient safety were typical priorities for neurosurgical service at King Abdullah Medical City. We expose the lines of management, triaging cases, the methods of handling confirmed and suspected neurosurgical patients, and strategies for discharging and following up patients. We identified hospital admission and discharge records starting from March 2020 till July to track the neurosurgical case burden and the state of service offered and the rate of infection among healthcare workers who participated in surgeries. RESULTS: At the peak time of the COVID-19 pandemic in Makka starting from March till July, we have admitted 250 neurosurgical patients. About 210 (84%) of them did surgeries according to the triaging protocol described in the article. About 155 (62%) of those who did surgeries were urgent and the rest were borderline or semi-urgent. About 10 (4%) were severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) positive and three of them died due to acute respiratory distress syndrome. Only two mortality cases were reported due to a neurological complication and not related to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The rest of the cases (98%) were discharged for follow-up without grave complications after they were offered the service. No neurosurgeons or anesthesia staff involved in offering the service were infected with SARS-CoV-2. Successful uninterrupted neurosurgical care was available for patients during that health crisis without any healthcare worker being infected. CONCLUSION: Following the suggested strategies, any center can provide the healthcare service amid any pandemic happening now or in the future without dismantling the normal health system, especially for life-saving cases in a critical specialty as neurosurgery.","Azab, Mohammed A.",Asian J Neurosurg,79,24

METHODS: We analyze the stroke admission rate in three hospitals in New York City from January 1, 2020 through April 17, 2020, identifying all cases of acute ischemic stroke, intraparenchymal hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage. RESULTS: We confirmed 518 cases of out-of-hospital stroke.

During the pandemic period, the slope was -4.4 (se = 1.00); i.e., the number of stroke admissions decreased an average of 4.4 per week, (p = 0.005), with weekly admissions averaging 23, a reduction of 44% versus baseline. This general result was not different by patient age, sex, or race/ethnicity. CONCLUSIONS: The weekly stroke admission rate started declining two weeks prior to the local surge of coronavirus admissions.

However, the effect of urbanization on natural host-pathogen systems remains poorly understood. Urban ducks occupy an interesting niche in that they directly interact with both humans and wild migratory birds, and either directly or indirectly with food production birds. Here we have collected samples from Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) residing in a pond in central Uppsala, Sweden, from January 2013 to January 2014. This artificial pond is kept ice-free during the winter months, and is a popular location where the ducks are fed, resulting in a resident population of ducks year-round. Nine hundred and seventy seven (977) fecal samples were screened for RNA viruses including: influenza A virus (IAV), avian paramyxovirus 1, avian coronavirus (CoV), and avian astrovirus (AstroV). This intra-annual dataset illustrates that these RNA viruses exhibit similar annual patterns to IAV, suggesting similar ecological factors are at play. Furthermore, in comparison to wild ducks, autumnal prevalence of IAV and CoV are lower in this urban population.

METHODS: AHSG serum levels were determined in treatment-naïve newly-diagnosed patients, 96 with ulcerative colitis (UC), 84 with Crohn's disease (CD), 62 with diarrhea-predominant or mixed irritable bowel syndrome (IBS, D- and M- types) and 180 healthy controls (HC), by an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). All patients were followed for a minimum period of 3 years at the Gastroenterology Department of the University Hospital of Larissa, Greece. C-reactive protein (CRP), anti-glycan antibodies, anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae mannan antibodies IgG, anti-mannobioside carbohydrate antibodies IgG, anti-laminariobioside carbohydrate antibodies IgG and anti-chitobioside carbohydrate antibodies IgA were also determined via immunonephelometry and ELISA, respectively. RESULTS: The mean ± SE of serum AHSG, following adjustment for confounders, was 0.32 ± 0.02 g/L in IBD, 0.32 ± 0.03 g/L in CD and 0.34 ± 0.03 g/L in UC patients, significantly lower than in IBS patients (0.7 ± 0.018 g/L) and HC (0.71 ± 0.02 g/L) (P < 0.0001, in all cases). AHSG levels were comparable between the CD and UC groups. Based on AHSG levels IBD patients could be distinguished from HC with about 90% sensitivity and specificity. Further adjusted analysis verified the inverse association between AHSG and penetrating, as well as stricturing CD (partial correlation coefficient: -0.45 and -0.33, respectively) (P < 0.05). After adjusting for confounding factors, inverse correlations between AHSG and CRP and the need for anti-TNFα therapy or surgery, were found (partial correlation coefficients: -0.31, -0.33, -0.41, respectively, P < 0.05, in all cases). Finally, IBD individuals who were seropositive, for at least one marker, had AHSG levels falling within the two lower quartiles (OR = 2.86, 95%CI: 1.5-5.44, P < 0.001) while those with at least two serological markers positive exhibited AHSG concentrations within the lowest quartile (OR = 5.03, 95%CI: 2.07-12.21, P < 0.001), after adjusting for age, sex and smoking. CONCLUSION: AHSG can be used to distinguish between IBD and IBS patients or HC while at the same time ""predicting"" complicated disease behavior, need for therapy escalation and surgery. Moreover, AHSG may offer new insights into the pathogenesis of IBD, since it is involved in key processes.","Manolakis, Anastassios C; Christodoulidis, Gregory; Kapsoritakis, Andreas N; Georgoulias, Panagiotis; Tiaka, Elisavet K; Oikonomou, Kostas; Valotassiou, Varvara J; Potamianos, Spyros P",World J Gastroenterol,79,20

Herein, we describe and apply a rapid, sensitive, and accurate virus neutralization assay for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The new assay is based on an HIV-1 lentiviral vector that contains a secreted intron Gaussia luciferase or secreted Nano-luciferase reporter cassette, pseudotyped with the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein, and is validated with a plaque reduction assay using an authentic, infectious SARS-CoV-2 strain. The new assay was used to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in serum from individuals with a broad range of COVID-19 symptoms, including intensive care unit (ICU) patients, health care workers (HCWs), and convalescent plasma donors. The highest neutralizing antibody titers were observed among ICU patients, followed by general hospitalized patients, HCWs and convalescent plasma donors. Our study highlights a wide phenotypic variation in human antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2, and demonstrates the efficacy of a novel lentivirus pseudotype assay for high-throughput serological surveys of neutralizing antibody titers in large cohorts.","Zeng, C.; Evans, J.

Fifty percent (3/6) of them tested positive for RVFV and neither DENV or CHIKV was detected. All patients were males between 20 and 48 years old who had no history of recent travel. This finding describes the first emergence of RVFV in Gedaref state. Considering that the state hosts a major market of livestock, and it has one of the largest-seasonal open pastures in the country that is usually flooded with herds from the neighbouring states and countries during the rainy season, this emergence could represent a major threat to public health in the region and countries importing animals and/or animal products from east Africa.

Sars-CoV-2 infection poses particular problems in pregnancy, as the infection more frequently causes severe complications than in unaffected pregnant women or nonpregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Now that vaccination is available and rapidly being implemented worldwide, the question arises whether pregnant women should be vaccinated, and if so, whether they should receive priority. Methods. Available scientific data and available guidelines about vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 were collected by the Guideline Committee of the International Society of Infectious Diseases in Obstetrics and Gynecology (ISIDOG) and were analyzed, discussed and summarized as guidelines for healthcare workers caring for pregnant women. Concluding statements were graded according to the Oxford evidence-based medicine grading system. Results. There is evidence to consider pregnancy as a risk factor for serious complications of COVID-19 infection, even in the absence of additional risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes and obesity which increase these risks even more in pregnancy. Currently available data slightly favor mRNA-based vaccines above vector-based vaccines during pregnancy and breastfeeding, until more safety data become available. Conclusion. ISIDOG advises policy makers and societies to prioritize pregnant women to receive vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 and favor the mRNA vaccines until further safety information becomes available.","Donders, Gilbert G.

The aim of this study was to examine the effects of aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA) on EV71 replication and to explore the underlying mechanism. METHODS: To measure the activity of ATA in inhibiting the cytopathic effect (CPE) of EV71, a cell-based neutralization (inhibition of virus-induced CPE) assay was performed. The effect of ATA was further confirmed using plaque reduction and viral yield reduction assays. A time of addition assay was performed to identify the mechanisms of ATA's anti-EV71 activity. We examined the effects of ATA on the following key steps involved in virus replication: (i) translation of the internal ribosomal entry site (IRES)-mediated viral polyprotein; (ii) the proteolytic activity of viral proteases 2A and/or 3C; and (iii) the viral 3D RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity. RESULTS: In this study, ATA was found to be a potent inhibitor of the replication of EV71. In the antiviral neutralization assay, ATA exhibited inhibitory activity against EV71 (TW/4643/98) and EV71 (TW/2231/98). Plaque assay further demonstrated that ATA inhibited EV71 replication with an EC(50) (effective concentration at which 50% of plaques were removed) of 2.9 µM. Studies on the mechanism of action revealed that ATA targets the early stage of the viral life cycle after viral entry. ATA was able to inhibit the RdRp activity of EV71, while neither the IRES-mediated translation of viral polyprotein nor the viral 3C protease activity was affected. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the findings in this study suggest that ATA is able to effectively inhibit EV71 replication through interfering with the viral 3D polymerase.","Hung, Hui-Chen; Chen, Tzu-Chun; Fang, Ming-Yu; Yen, Kuei-Jung; Shih, Shin-Ru; Hsu, John T.-A.; Tseng, Ching-Ping",J Antimicrob Chemother,79,1

As such, parks may be crucial for how people have handled effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly the increasingly limited recreational opportunities, widespread financial uncertainty, and consequent heightened anxiety. Despite the documented benefits of parks, however, many states have instituted park shutdown orders due to fears that public parks could facilitate SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Here we use geotagged social media data from state, county, and local parks throughout New Jersey to examine whether park visitation increased when the COVID-19 pandemic began and whether park shutdown orders were effective at deterring park usage. We compare park usage during four discrete stages of spring 2020: (1) before the pandemic began, (2) during the beginning of the pandemic, (3) during the New Jersey governor’s state-wide park shutdown order, and (4) following the lifting of the shutdown. We find that park visitation increased by 63.4% with the onset of the pandemic. The subsequent park shutdown order caused visitation in closed parks to decline by 76.1% while parks that remained open continued to experience elevated visitation levels. Visitation then returned to elevated pre-shutdown levels when closed parks were allowed to reopen. Altogether, our results indicate that parks continue to provide crucial services to society, particularly in stressful times when opportunities for recreation are limited. Furthermore, our results suggest that policies targeting human behavior can be effective and are largely reversible. As such, we should continue to invest in public parks and to explore the role of parks in managing public health and psychological well-being.","Volenec, Zoe M.; Abraham, Joel O.; Becker, Alexander D.; Dobson, Andy P.",PLoS One,79,3

Our findings indicate that the implementation of masking policies in school settings can reduce additional infections post-school opening by 23–36% for fully-open schools, with an additional 11–13% reduction for hybrid schooling, depending on mask quality and fit. Masking policies and hybrid schooling can also reduce peak hospitalization need by 71% and result in the fewest additional deaths post-school opening. We show that given the current vaccination rates within the community, the best option for children and the general population is to employ consistent high-quality masking, and use social distancing where possible.","Mele, Jessica; Rosenstrom, Erik; Ivy, Julie; Mayorga, Maria; Patel, Mehul D.; Swann, Julie",medRxiv,79,16

The aim of this study is to understand which investigations are useful in a screening protocol aimed at protecting health but also avoiding inappropriate examinations. METHODS: We conducted a cohort study of a professional soccer team that is based on an extensive screening protocol for resuming training during the COVID-19 pandemic. It included personal history, antigen swabs, blood tests, spirometry, resting/stress-test ECG with oxygen saturation monitoring, echocardiogram, Holter and chest CT. We also compared the findings with prior data from the same subjects before infection and with data from SARS-CoV-2-negative players. RESULTS: None of the players had positive swab and/or anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM class antibodies. Out of 30 players, 18 (60%) had IgG class antibodies. None had suffered severe SARS-CoV-2-related disease, 12 (66.7%) had complained of mild COVID-19-related symptoms and 6 (33.3%) were asymptomatic. None of the players we examined revealed significant cardiovascular abnormalities after clinical recovery. A mild reduction in spirometry parameters versus pre-COVID-19 values was observed in all athletes, but it was statistically significant (p<0.05) only in SARS-CoV-2-positive athletes. One SARS-CoV-2-positive player showed increased troponin I level, but extensive investigation did not show signs of myocardial damage. CONCLUSION: In this small cohort of athletes with previous asymptomatic/mild SARS-CoV-2 infection, a comprehensive screening protocol including blood tests, spirometry, resting ECG, stress-test ECG with oxygen saturation monitoring and echocardiogram did not identify relevant anomalies.

The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that causes COVID-19 was first reported in December of 2019 in Wuhan, China and reached most corners of the globe in less than two months. In just over a year since the initial infections, COVID-19 infected almost 100 million people worldwide. Although similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 has resisted treatments that are effective against other coronaviruses. Crystal structures of two SARS-CoV-2 proteins, spike protein and main protease, have been reported and can serve as targets for studies in neutralizing this threat. We have employed molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations, and machine learning to identify from a library of 26 million molecules possible candidate compounds that may attenuate or neutralize the effects of this virus. The viability of selected candidate compounds against SARS-CoV-2 was determined experimentally by biolayer interferometry and FRET-based activity protein assays along with virus-based assays. In the pseudovirus assay, imatinib and lapatinib had IC(50) values below 10 μM, while candesartan cilexetil had an IC(50) value of approximately 67 µM against M(pro) in a FRET-based activity assay. Comparatively, candesartan cilexetil had the highest selectivity index of all compounds tested as its half-maximal cytotoxicity concentration 50 (CC(50)) value was the only one greater than the limit of the assay (>100 μM).","Lau, Edmond Y.; Negrete, Oscar A.; Bennett, W.

Research conducted before the pandemic showed that mathematics homework is often unsuccessful or stressful for both parents and children and that tension exists between home and school in the learning of mathematics. Understanding parents’ experience of home-learning mathematics during lockdown has implications for positive learning relationships between home and school in the future. During the lockdown, we sent an online survey to New Zealand parents and received 634 responses. We found that parents were generally very engaged in the home learning of mathematics. They reported a range of opinions about the quality of mathematics work and teacher support, and there was a correlation between general stress levels and negative opinions. To further support their child’s mathematics learning, many parents turned to online mathematics programs, about which they were very positive. Parents of younger children were more positive about their overall home-learning experiences of mathematics, but the crisis brought to the fore several pre-existing issues. We argue that these findings have implications for mathematics home learning in the future; we suggest that schools listen to parental feedback regarding the quality, level, and quantity of mathematics work. Additionally, schools could consider ways to deliver effective teacher support and to foster parental agency in helping their children with mathematics learning.","Darragh, Lisa; Franke, Nike",Int J Sci Math Educ,79,7

Tissue antigen expression variations influence host susceptibility to many infections. This study aimed to investigate the closely linked Lewis (FUT3) and ABO histo‐blood types, including secretor (FUT2) status, to infections with SARS‐CoV‐2 and the corresponding severity of COVID‐19. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients (Caucasians, n = 338) were genotyped for ABO, FUT3, and FUT2, and compared to a reference population of blood donors (n = 250,298). The association between blood types and severity of COVID‐19 was addressed by dividing patients into four categories: hospitalized individuals in general wards, patients admitted to the intensive care unit with and without intubation, and deceased patients. Comorbidities were considered in subsequent analyses. RESULTS: Patients with blood type Lewis (a−b−) or O were significantly less likely to be hospitalized (odds ratio [OR] 0.669, confidence interval [CI] 0.446–0.971, OR 0.710, CI 0.556–0.900, respectively), while type AB was significantly more prevalent in the patient cohort (OR 1.519, CI 1.014–2.203). The proportions of secretors/nonsecretors, and Lewis a+ or Lewis b+ types were consistent between patients and controls. The analyzed blood groups were not associated with the clinical outcome as defined. DISCUSSION: Blood types Lewis (a−b−) and O were found to be protective factors, whereas the group AB is suggested to be a risk factor for COVID‐19.

Few cases of severe and often fatal COVID-19 have been reported although the infection is mild in the large majority. Children with cancers are recognised as a high risk group for all infections. Since there aren’t any definite treatment guidelines established in children with severe COVID, treatment is guided by adult recommendations which too are often not evidence based. We report the case of a 4-year-old girl with severe COVID-19 associated pneumonia who presented to us as febrile neutropenia. The use of convalescent plasma along with steroids and IVIG showed dramatic results in this child and she recovered without the need for any specific treatment. This is highlighted as one of the earliest cases that is reporting the use of convalescent plasma in a child; the first ever in a child with underlying malignancy.","Shankar, Ravi; Radhakrishnan, Nita; Dua, Seema; Arora, Satyam; Rana, Megha; Sahu, Dinesh Kumar; Rai, Sumit; Gupta, Devendra Kumar",Transfus Apher Sci,79,21

The mental health of a pregnant mother is vital for preventing pregnancy and birth-related complications. This study aimed to determine the magnitude and associated factors of General anxiety disorder among perinatal service users in Dilla University referral hospital, Dilla, Ethiopia. METHODS: A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 178 respondents from April 6 – May 6, 2020. The sampling technique of this study was Consecutive sampling. Data were collected using a structured interview. General anxiety disorder (GAD-7) was used to determine the outcome variable. Logistic regression analysis and adjusted odd ratio at 95% CI and p < 0.05 was used to determine the statistically significant association between general anxiety disorder and its predictors. RESULT: A total of 178 respondents with a 100% response rate were enrolled in the study. The mean income of respondents was 1500 (±700) Ethiopian birr. The overall prevalence of general anxiety disorder (GAD) was 32.2%.

However, the sensitivity and specificity of the immunological approach are relatively low because there are no specific markers for antigen-specific Th cells, and some of the Th cells that do not produce cytokines can be overlooked using this approach. In this study, we found that MTB-specific peptides of ESAT-6/CFP-10 can stimulate the expression of CD40L specifically in CD4(+) T cells but not other cells from pleural fluid cells (PFCs) in patients with tuberculous pleurisy (TBP). CD4(+)CD40L(+) but not CD4(+)CD40L(−) T cells express IFN-γ, IL-2, TNF-α, IL-17 or IL-22 after stimulation with MTB-specific peptides. In addition, CD4(+)CD40L(+) T cells were found to be mostly polyfunctional T cells that simultaneously produce IFN-γ, IL-2 and TNF-α and display an effector or effector memory phenotype (CD45RA(−)CD45RO(+)CCR7(−)CD62L(−)ICOS(−)). To determine the specificity of CD4(+)CD40L(+) T cells, we incubated PFCs with ESTA-6/CFP-10 peptides and sorted live CD4(+)CD40L(+) and CD4(+)CD40L(−) T cells by flow cytometry. We further demonstrated that sorted CD4(+)CD40L(+), but not CD4(+)CD40L(−) fractions, principally produced IFN-γ, IL-2, TNF-α, IL-17 and IL-22 following restimulation with ESTA-6/CFP-10 peptides. Taken together, our data indicate that the expression of CD40L on MTB-specific CD4(+) T cells could be a good marker for the evaluation and isolation of MTB-specific Th cells and might also be useful in the diagnosis of TB.","Li, Li; Qiao, Dan; Fu, Xiaoying; Lao, Suihua; Zhang, Xianlan; Wu, Changyou",PLoS One,79,28

Results from nonlinearity and structural break tests indicate the misspecification of the linear causality model and point to the suitability of applying a time-varying model. A DCC-MGARCH framework is thus applied and the results indicate significant predictability of the three latent factors from the EMVID index at each point of the entire sample, and also provide evidence of instantaneous spillover. Finally, the results of measuring safe-haven characteristic of the US Treasury market show that US treasuries with long-term maturities as captured by the level factor are consistently negatively correlated with the EMVID index, i.e., they act as a safe-haven, with the slope factor (medium-term maturities) following this trend since 2007, and the slope factor (short-term maturities) also showing signs of a safe-haven since May of 2020. Overall, the findings provide reasonable evidence that US Treasury securities can hedge the risks associated with the financial market in the wake of the current COVID-19 pandemic.","Gupta, Rangan; Subramaniam, Sowmya; Bouri, Elie; Ji, Qiang",,79,9

Current drug-based therapies are of limited efficacy, costly, and have potential negative side effects. By contrast, photobiomodulation therapy, which involves periodic brief exposure to red or infrared light, is a noninvasive, safe, and affordable method that is currently being used to treat a wide range of diseases with underlying inflammatory conditions. Here, we show that exposure to two 10-min, high-intensity periods per day of infrared light causes a marked reduction in the TLR-4 dependent inflammatory response pathway, which has been implicated in the onset of cytokine storms in COVID-19 patients. Infrared light exposure resulted in a significant decline in NFkB and AP1 activity as measured by the reporter gene assay; decreased expression of inflammatory marker genes IL-6, IL-8, TNF-alpha, INF-alpha, and INF-beta as determined by qPCR gene expression assay; and an 80% decline in secreted cytokine IL6 as measured by ELISA assay in cultured human cells. All of these changes occurred after only 48 hours of treatment. We suggest that an underlying cellular mechanism involving modulation of ROS may downregulate the host immune response after Infrared Light exposure, leading to decrease in inflammation. We further discuss technical considerations involving light sources and exposure conditions to put these observations into potential clinical use to treat COVID-19 induced mortality.","Aguida, Blanche; Pooam, Marootpong; Ahmad, Margaret; Jourdan, Nathalie",Communicative & Integrative Biology,79,1

The misinformation generated from this topic had caused great confusion and public concern. OBJECTIVE: Our goals were to analyze the trend and contents of the relevant posts during the outbreak. We also aimed to understand the characteristics of the misinformation and to provide suggestions to reduce public misconception on social media during the emerging disease outbreak. METHODS: The original microblog posts were collected from China’s Sina Weibo and Tencent Weibo using a combination of keywords between April 1, 2013 and June 2, 2013. We analyzed the weekly and daily trend of the relevant posts. Content analyses were applied to categorize the posts into 4 types with unified sorting criteria. The posts’ characteristics and geographic locations were also analyzed in each category. We conducted further analysis on the top 5 most popular misleading posts. RESULTS: A total of 1680 original microblog posts on the topic were retrieved and 341 (20.30%) of these posts were categorized as misleading messages. The number of relevant posts had not increased much during the first 2 weeks but rose to a high level in the next 2 weeks after the sudden increase in number of reported cases at the beginning of week 3. The posts under “misleading messages” occurred and increased from the beginning of week 3, but their daily posting number decreased when the daily number of posts under “refuting messages” outnumbered them. The microbloggers of the misleading posts had the lowest mean rank of followers and previous posts, but their posts had a highest mean rank of posts. The proportion of “misleading messages” in places with no reported cases was significantly higher than that in the epidemic areas (23.6% vs 13.8%). The popular misleading posts appeared to be short and consisted of personal narratives, which were easily disseminated on social media. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggested the importance of responding to common questions and misconceptions on social media platforms from the beginning of disease outbreaks. Authorities need to release clear and reliable information related to the popular topics early on. The microbloggers posting correct information should be empowered and their posts could be promoted to clarify false information. Equal importance should be attached to clarify misinformation in both the outbreak and nonoutbreak areas.","Chen, Bin; Shao, Jian; Liu, Kui; Cai, Gaofeng; Jiang, Zhenggang; Huang, Yuru; Gu, Hua; Jiang, Jianmin",JMIR Public Health Surveill,79,22

However, the role of the respiratory tract microbiome in the development of acute wheeze is unclear. To investigate whether severe wheezing episodes in children are associated with bacterial dysbiosis in the respiratory tract, oropharyngeal swabs were collected from 109 children with acute wheezing attending the only tertiary paediatric hospital in Perth, Australia. The bacterial community from these samples was explored using next generation sequencing and compared to samples from 75 non-wheezing controls. No significant difference in bacterial diversity was observed between samples from those with wheeze and healthy controls. Within the wheezing group, attendance at kindergarten or preschool was however, associated with increased bacterial diversity. Rhinovirus (RV) infection did not have a significant effect on bacterial community composition. A significant difference in bacterial richness was observed between children with RV-A and RV-C infection, however this is likely due to the differences in age group between the patient cohorts. The bacterial community within the oropharynx was found to be diverse and heterogeneous. Age and attendance at day care or kindergarten were important factors in driving bacterial diversity. However, wheeze and viral infection were not found to significantly relate to the bacterial community.

We conducted an unbiased CRISPRi screen to uncover druggable pathways controlling Spike protein binding to human cells. We found that the protein BRD2 is an essential node in the cellular response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. BRD2 is required for ACE2 transcription in human lung epithelial cells and cardiomyocytes, and BRD2 inhibitors currently evaluated in clinical trials potently block endogenous ACE2 expression and SARS-CoV-2 infection of human cells. BRD2 also controls transcription of several other genes induced upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, including the interferon response, which in turn regulates ACE2 levels. It is possible that the previously reported interaction between the viral E protein and BRD2 evolved to manipulate the transcriptional host response during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Together, our results pinpoint BRD2 as a potent and essential regulator of the host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and highlight the potential of BRD2 as a novel therapeutic target for COVID-19.","Tian, Ruilin; Samelson, Avi J.; Rezelj, Veronica V.; Chen, Merissa; Ramadoss, Gokul N.; Guo, Xiaoyan; Kain, Alice Mac; Tran, Quang Dinh; Lim, Shion A.; Lui, Irene; Nunez, James; Rockwood, Sarah J.; Liu, Na; Carlson-Stevermer, Jared; Oki, Jennifer; Maures, Travis; Holden, Kevin; Weissman, Jonathan S.; Wells, James A.; Conklin, Bruce; Vignuzzi, Marco; Kampmann, Martin",bioRxiv,79,16

Previously, we developed a mathematical model to understand factors governing the effectiveness of traveller screening to prevent spread of emerging pathogens (Gostic et al., 2015). Here, we estimate the impact of different screening programs given current knowledge of key COVID-19 life history and epidemiological parameters. Even under best-case assumptions, we estimate that screening will miss more than half of infected people. Breaking down the factors leading to screening successes and failures, we find that most cases missed by screening are fundamentally undetectable, because they have not yet developed symptoms and are unaware they were exposed. Our work underscores the need for measures to limit transmission by individuals who become ill after being missed by a screening program.

Like tocilizumab, Vitamin D appears to modulate the activity of an interleukin (IL-6), which may explain the seasonal variation in prevalence of influenza. While most cases of COVID-19 have, thus far, occurred in the Northern Hemisphere winter, limiting the ability to assess seasonal variation, there remains substantial variation in the severity of this condition that has yet to be explained. A retrospective comparison of Vitamin D levels in previously obtained blood samples between survivors and confirmed fatalities could establish a rationale for implementation of widespread Vitamin D supplementation.

Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive conventional therapy plus Umifenovir (Arbidol) (200mg*3/day) or Favipiravir (1600mg*2/first day followed by 600mg*2/day) for 10 days. The primary outcome was clinical recovery rate of Day 7. Latency to relief for pyrexia and cough, the rate of auxiliary oxygen therapy (AOT) or noninvasive mechanical ventilation (NMV) were the secondary outcomes. Safety data were collected for 17 days. Results 240 enrolled COVID-19 patients underwent randomization; 120 patients were assigned to receive Favipiravir (116 assessed), and 120 to receive Arbidol (120 assessed). Clinical recovery rate of Day 7 does not significantly differ between Favipiravir group (71/116) and Arbidol group (62/120) (P=0.1396, difference of recovery rate: 0.0954; 95% CI: -0.0305 to 0.2213). Favipiravir led to shorter latencies to relief for both pyrexia (difference: 1.70 days, P<0.0001) and cough (difference: 1.75 days, P<0.0001).

In order to restrict the spread of disease, intra- and interstate movements of public by road/rail and air were completely halted except for those involved in essential services. India followed the option of complete lockdown (LD) in phase 1 (25th March to 14th April 2020) followed by phase 2 (15th April to 3rd May), phase 3 (4th May to 17th May), and phase 4 (18th May to 31st May 2020). Restrictions on agriculture and industrial sector were eased out in each successive phase after LD 1 and eventually country started unlock phase from 1st June to 30th June and so on. In this chapter, a discussion is made based on the data on criteria pollutants and air quality index (AQI) for selected sites in New Delhi and for selected cities across the country, respectively to spell out impacts of COVID-19 (which are initially positive) and the lessons for long-term planning for improvement of air quality. During LD 1, emissions from vehicles, industries, and construction activities were substantially down and therefore, levels of criteria pollutants CO, NOx, SO(2), Pb, O(3), PM(2.5) in ambient atmosphere came down and AQI showed improvement which was considered as silver line of the COVID-19 pandemic. Interestingly, not all criteria pollutants showed decrease to same extent and rather some still stayed above the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) values over New Delhi, the national capital of India. As the restrictions eased out in LD 3 and LD 4, pollution levels started increasing but again not uniformly for all pollutants and for all locations in New Delhi. During Unlock 1.0, emissions did not increase suddenly rather in a systematic linear fashion. In addition, air quality and AQI did not deteriorate much during Unlock 1.0 due to onset of monsoon rains in the country. It is suggested that all emission sources and people’s movement cannot be restricted during normal days in any country, as it has hit the socioeconomic health of nation very hard.

METHODS: We used routine care data from 36 hospitals in France and Luxembourg to assess the effectiveness of corticosteroids at 0.4 mg/kg/day eq. prednisone (treatment group) versus standard of care (control group) among adults [Formula: see text] 80 years old with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection or CT-scan images typical of COVID-19 pneumonia, requiring oxygen ≥ 3 L/min, and with an inflammatory syndrome (C-reactive protein ≥ 40 mg/L). The primary outcome was overall survival at day 14. In our main analysis, characteristics of patients at baseline (i.e., time when patients met all inclusion criteria) were balanced by using propensity-score inverse probability of treatment weighting. RESULTS: Among the 267 patients included in the analysis, 98 were assigned to the treatment group. Their median age was 86 years (interquartile range 83 to 90), and 95% had a SARS-CoV-2 PCR-confirmed diagnosis. In total, 43/98 (43.9%) patients in the treatment group and 84/166 (50.6%) in the control group died before day 14 (weighted hazard ratio [wHR] 0.67, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.99). The treatment and control groups did not differ significantly for the proportion of patients discharged to home/rehabilitation at day 14 (wRR 1.12, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.82). Twenty-two (16.7%) patients receiving corticosteroids developed adverse events, but only 11 (6.4%) from the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Corticosteroids were associated with a significant increase in the overall survival at day 14 of patients aged 80 years and older hospitalised for severe COVID-19.","Laure, Gallay; Viet-Thi, Tran; Elodie, Perrodeau; Nicolas, Vignier; Matthieu, Mahevas; Francesca, Bisio; Emmanuel, Forestier; Francois-Xavier, Lescure",Clin Microbiol Infect,79,24

Our objective is to describe the cardiac manifestations found in an international cohort of 55 pediatric cases with multi‐system inflammatory syndrome (MIS‐C) during the SARS‐CoV2 pandemic. METHODS AND RESULTS: We reviewed data on previously healthy pediatric patients (≤18 years) with structurally normal hearts who presented at hospitals in the United States, United Kingdom, Spain and Pakistan with MIS‐C and had consultation with a pediatric cardiologist. Data collected included demographics, clinical presentation, laboratory values, electrocardiographic abnormalities, echocardiographic findings and initial therapies. A total of 55 patients presented with MIS‐C. Thirty‐five patients (64%) had evidence of decreased left ventricular function, 17 (31%) had valvulitis, 12 (22%) with pericardial effusion and 11 (20%) with coronary abnormalities. Twenty‐seven (49%) required ICU admission and 24 (44%) had evidence of shock. Eleven patients (20%) fulfilled complete Kawasaki disease criteria and had lower NT pro‐BNP, D‐dimer and ferritin levels compared with those who did not fulfill criteria. Electrophysiologic abnormalities occurred in 6 patients and included complete atrioventricular (AV) block, transient AV block and ventricular tachycardia.

Materials and Methods: This study included patients who were admitted to or referred to the hospital between 20 March and 20 June 2020, diagnosed with COVID-19 via a positive RT-PCR from nasal and pharyngeal swab samples. The troponin I level was measured from each patient. Medical records of patients were retrospectively reviewed and analyzed. Results: A hundred and five patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and hospitalized, or who died in the hospital due to COVID-19, were included in this study. There was a statistically significant difference between the troponin I high and low level groups in terms of age (years), BMI, shortness of breath (SB), oxygen saturation (%), hypertension, length of stay in the ICU; and for mortality, C-reactive protein, the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, hemoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase, ferritin, D-dimer, creatine kinase-MB, prothrombin time, calcium, and 25-hydroxy vitamin 25(OH)D3 (all p < 0.05). In the logistic analyses, a significant association was noted between troponin I and the adjusted risk of mortality. A ROC curve analysis identified troponin I values > 7.8 pg/mL as an effective cut-off point in mortality for patients with COVID-19. A troponin I value of higher than 7.8 pg/mL yielded a sensitivity of 78% and a specificity of 86%. Conclusions: The hospital mortality rate was higher among patients diagnosed with COVID-19 accompanied by troponin levels higher than 7.8 pg/mL. Therefore, in patients diagnosed with COVID-19, elevated troponin I levels >7.8 pg/mL can be considered an independent risk factor for mortality.","Özyılmaz, Sinem; Ergün Alış, Esra; Ermiş, Emrah; Allahverdiyev, Samir; Uçar, Hakan",Medicina (Kaunas),79,17
638700,638700,638700,Viral Respiratory Infections and Asthma: the Course Ahead,13.409577,9.927927,2010-06-01,"BACKGROUND: Recent literature indicates that the pollutant, particulate matter PM2.5, may have an impact on COVID-19 related mortality. COVID-19 has been found adherent to PM2.5 and may be involved in the transmission and the exacerbation of COVID-19 infection, possibly due to PM2.5 adverse influence on respiratory immunity. The PM2.5 levels in underground subways have been found up to 90 times higher than the surface levels. Moreover, the commuter congestion in the presence of such high levels of PM2.5 further encouraged COVID-19 human to human transmission. METHOD: The levels of PM2.5 were retrieved from literature assessing particulate matter PM2.5 measured on subway platforms in two groups of cities. These cities were differentiated by the COVID-19 population percentage mortality rate (0.007% vs 0.09% (p<0.0004) the city population, more than a 10-fold difference. Data regarding the number of stations, length of the networks (km) and the annual ridership were also obtained from literature related to underground commuting. RESULTS: The population percentage mortality related to COVID-19 infection correlated significantly for both minimum (p<0.01) and maximum (p<0.00001) levels of PM2.5. The city subways with low COVID-19 mortality had minimum platform PM2.5 levels of 27.4 (SD+/-17.2g/m3) compared to 63.4g/m3 (SD+/-10.8g/m3) in cities with high COVID-19 associated mortality (p<0.01). Subway maximum levels of PM2.5 in cities with low COVID-19 mortality was 53.4g/m3 (SD+/-21.8g/m3) while that of underground networks with high COVID-19 mortality had maximum platform PM2.5 levels of 172.1g/m3 (SD+/-98g/m3) (p<0.001). The cities with higher COVID-19 mortality had longer networks 230km (SD+/-111km) versus 119km (SD+/-99km) ( p<0.03) and more stations 191 (SD+/-109) versus 102 (SD+/-94) (p<0.047). Although the annual ridership in the cities with the high COVID-19 mortality was higher (1034x106 vs 751x106) this did not achieve statistical significance. The maximum PM2.5 correlated with the number of stations (p<0.045) and the length of the networks (p< 0.044). The minimum PM2.5 did not achieve similar significant correlations to subway variables. Ridership significantly correlated with number of stations (p<0.01) and the length of the network (p<0.02). CONCLUSION: Underground networks may have inherent characteristics accelerating spread of COVID-19 infection and consequent mortality. The highly elevated levels of PM2.5 in overcrowded subways with extensive reach may have acted as a co-factor to disseminate the pandemic.

The aim of this study was to review the reorganization of our unit, map the change in volume of departmental activities and discuss potential solutions. METHODS: Departmental activities over the months of April and May 2020 and 2019 were analysed. Details of admissions, operations, diagnostic procedures, outpatient reviews, morbidities and mortalities were recorded. Operations were performed on two sites, with elective operation transferred to an offsite, COVID-free hospital. RESULTS: Seventy-four emergency operations were performed onsite, with 85 elective operations outsourced. A total of 159 operations were performed, compared with 280 in the same period in 2019. Five (5.0%) of 101 admitted patients to the COVID hospital contracted COVID-19. No patients outsourced to the COVID-free hospital were infected there. Outpatient referrals to urology service decreased from 928 to 481. There was a 66% decrease in new cancer diagnoses. A virtual review clinic was established, with remaining outpatients reviewed through a telephone clinic platform. CONCLUSION: Compared with 2019, we performed fewer operations and outpatient procedures, had fewer admissions and diagnosed fewer patients with new cancers. However, outsourcing elective operation to designated non-COVID hospitals prevented the infection of any patient with COVID-19 in the post-operative period. The use of virtual clinic and telephone clinic has had some success in replacing traditional outpatient visits. The overall significant decrease in operative volume will likely precipitate a mismatch between demand and service provision in the coming months, unless capacity is increased.","Collins, Patrick M.; Madden, Aideen; O’Connell, Clare; Omer, Shawgi Abdelrazig; Shakeel Inder, Mohammud; Casey, Rowan G.; Flynn, Robert J.; Thomas, Arun Z.; Smyth, Lisa G.; Manecksha, Rustom P.",Ir J Med Sci,79,29

METHODS: A nested case-control study was performed with 2056 noise-exposed workers from a chemical fiber factory and an energy company who underwent occupational health examinations in 2019 as study subjects. Propensity score matching was conducted to screen cases and controls by matching sex, age, and the consumption of tobacco and alcohol. A total of 1269 participants were enrolled. Then, general information and noise exposure of the study subjects were obtained through a questionnaire survey and on-site noise detection. According to the results of audiological evaluations, the participants were divided into the case group (n = 432, high-frequency threshold shift > 25 dB) and the matched control group (n = 837, high-frequency threshold shift ≤ 25 dB) by propensity score matching. Genotyping for PER1 rs2253820 and rs2585405; PER2 rs56386336 and rs934945; CRY1 rs1056560 and rs3809236; CRY2 rs2292910 and rs6798; BDNF rs11030099, rs7124442 and rs6265; and NTF3 rs1805149 was conducted using the TaqMan-PCR technique. RESULTS: In the dominant model and the co-dominant model, the distribution of PER1 rs2585405 genotypes between the case group and the control group was significantly different (P = 0.03, P = 0.01). The NIHL risk of the subjects with the GC genotype was 1.41 times the risk of those carrying the GG genotype (95% confidence interval (CI) of odds ratio (OR): 1.01-1.96), and the NIHL risk of the subjects with the CC genotype was 0.93 times the risk of those carrying the GG genotype (95%CI of OR: 0.71-1.21). After the noise exposure period and noise exposure intensities were stratified, in the co-dominant model, the adjusted OR values for noise intensities of ≤ 85 was 1.23 (95%CI: 0.99-1.53). In the dominant model, the adjusted OR values for noise exposure periods of ≤ 16 years and noise intensities of ≤ 85 were 1.88 (95%CI: 1.03-3.42) and 1.64 (95%CI: 1.12-2.38), respectively. CONCLUSION: The CC/CG genotype of rs2585405 in the PER1 gene was identified as a potential risk factor for NIHL in Chinese noise-exposed workers, and interaction between rs2585405 and high temperature was found to be associated with NIHL risk.","Chen, Hao; Ding, Xuexue; Ding, Enmin; Chen, Mengyao; Wang, Huimin; Yang, Guangzhi; Zhu, Baoli",BMC Med Genomics,79,1

The spike glycoprotein (S) is a promising target for inducing immune responses and providing protection; thus the ongoing efforts for the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and therapeutic developments are mostly spiraling around S glycoprotein. The matured functional spike glycoprotein is presented on the virion surface as trimers, which contain two subunits, such as S1 (virus attachment) and S2 (virus fusion). The S1 subunit harbors the N-terminal domain (NTD) and the receptor-binding domain (RBD). The RBD is responsible for binding to host-cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The NTD and RBD of S1, and the S2 of S glycoprotein are the major structural moieties to design and develop spike-based vaccine candidates and therapeutics. Here, we have identified three novel epitopes (20-amino acid peptides) in the regions NTD, RBD, and S2 domains, respectively, by structural and immunoinformatic analysis. We have shown as a proof of principle in the murine model, the potential role of these novel epitopes in-inducing humoral and cellular immune responses. Further analysis has shown that RBD and S2 directed epitopes were able to efficiently inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV-2 wild-type virus in vitro suggesting their role as virus entry inhibitors. Structural analysis revealed that S2-epitope is a part of the heptad repeat 2 (HR2) domain which might have plausible inhibitory effects on virus fusion. Taken together, this study discovered novel epitopes that might have important implications in the development of potential SARS-CoV-2 spike-based vaccine and therapeutics.","Vishwakarma, Preeti; Yadav, Naveen; Rizvi, Zaigham Abbas; Khan, Naseem Ahmed; Chiranjivi, Adarsh Kumar; Mani, Shailendra; Bansal, Manish; Dwivedi, Prabhanjan; Shrivastava, Tripti; Kumar, Rajesh; Awasthi, Amit; Ahmed, Shubbir; Samal, Sweety",Front Immunol,79,22

Concerns have been raised that HCWs from ethnic minority groups are more likely to be vaccine hesitant (defined by the World Health Organisation as refusing or delaying a vaccination) than those of White ethnicity, but there are limited data on SARS-CoV-2 vaccine hesitancy and its predictors in UK HCWs. METHODS: Nationwide prospective cohort study and qualitative study in a multi-ethnic cohort of clinical and non-clinical UK HCWs. We analysed ethnic differences in SARS-CoV-2 vaccine hesitancy adjusting for demographics, vaccine trust, and perceived risk of COVID-19. We explored reasons for hesitancy in qualitative data using a framework analysis. FINDINGS: 11,584 HCWs were included in the cohort analysis. 23% (2704) reported vaccine hesitancy. Compared to White British HCWs (21.3% hesitant), HCWs from Black Caribbean (54.2%), Mixed White and Black Caribbean (38.1%), Black African (34.4%), Chinese (33.1%), Pakistani (30.4%), and White Other (28.7%) ethnic groups were significantly more likely to be hesitant. In adjusted analysis, Black Caribbean (aOR 3.37, 95% CI 2.11 - 5.37), Black African (aOR 2.05, 95% CI 1.49 - 2.82), White Other ethnic groups (aOR 1.48, 95% CI 1.19 - 1.84) were significantly more likely to be hesitant. Other independent predictors of hesitancy were younger age, female sex, higher score on a COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs scale, lower trust in employer, lack of influenza vaccine uptake in the previous season, previous COVID-19, and pregnancy. Qualitative data from 99 participants identified the following contributors to hesitancy: lack of trust in government and employers, safety concerns due to the speed of vaccine development, lack of ethnic diversity in vaccine studies, and confusing and conflicting information. Participants felt uptake in ethnic minority communities might be improved through inclusive communication, involving HCWs in the vaccine rollout, and promoting vaccination through trusted networks. INTERPRETATION: Despite increased risk of COVID-19, HCWs from some ethnic minority groups are more likely to be vaccine hesitant than their White British colleagues. Strategies to build trust and dispel myths surrounding the COVID-19 vaccine in these communities are urgently required. Emphasis should be placed on the safety and benefit of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in pregnancy and in those with previous COVID-19. Public health communications should be inclusive, non-stigmatising and utilise trusted networks.

Comprehensive telehealth interventions may help ameliorate PPDM, but existing approaches have rarely been designed with clinical implementation in mind, limiting use in routine practice. We describe a study testing a novel telehealth intervention that comprehensively targets clinic-refractory PPDM, and was explicitly developed for practical delivery using existing Veterans Health Administration (VHA) clinical infrastructure. Methods Practical Telehealth to Improve Control and Engagement for Patients with Clinic-Refractory Diabetes Mellitus (PRACTICE-DM) is an ongoing randomized controlled trial comparing two 12-month interventions: 1) standard VHA Home Telehealth (HT) telemonitoring/care coordination; or 2) the PRACTICE-DM intervention, a comprehensive HT-delivered intervention combining telemonitoring, self-management support, diet/activity support, medication management, and depression management. The primary outcome is HbA1c. Secondary outcomes include diabetes distress, self-care, self-efficacy, weight, depressive symptoms, implementation barriers/facilitators, and costs. We hypothesize that the PRACTICE-DM intervention will reduce HbA1c by >0.6% versus standard HT over 12 months. Results Enrollment for this ongoing trial concluded in January 2020; 200 patients were randomized (99 to standard HT and 101 to the PRACTICE-DM intervention). The cohort has a mean age of 58 and is 23% female and 72% African American. Mean baseline HbA1c and BMI were 10.2% and 34.8 kg/m2.

We aimed to provide an alternative to laboratory tests and to assess the value of home testing as part of our regular services going forward. METHODS: Home test kits as well as accompanying user instructions were made available to our patients with paediatric IBD that required faecal calprotectin test between 17 April and 12 August 2020. Once the user completed the test, results were automatically uploaded to the result portal and clinical staff were alerted. A user feedback questionnaire was sent to users that had completed the home test. RESULTS: Of the 54 patients, 41 (76%) aged between 4.7 and 18.1 years used the home test. A total of 45 home tests were done, one of which produced an invalid result. The decision to modify management was made in 12 (29%) of the patients, while 14 (34%) had no changes made and 15 (37%) required further assessment. Twenty (48.8%) responded to the questionnaire and 85% stated that they preferred the home test to the laboratory testing method. CONCLUSIONS: Home calprotectin tests were useful in guiding clinical management during a time when laboratory testing was less available. They may offer benefits as part of routine paediatric IBD monitoring to help target appointments and reduce unnecessary hospital attendances in the future.","Jere, Mwansa; Garrick, Vikki; Curtis, Lee; Tayler, Rachel; Gervais, Lisa; Gerasimidis, Konstantinos; Hansen, Richard",BMJ Open Gastroenterol,79,14

The relatively fast spread of the infection to Slovenia was expected, and preventive measures for its suppression were widely discussed. METHODS: An online questionnaire was designed to evaluate adherence to preventive measures and the extent to which the taking of preventive measures was associated with people’s anxiety level, psychological burden, their perceived vulnerability to disease, germ aversion and a number of demographic characteristics in the early stage of Covid-19 spread. The survey was active for 24 hours (13–14 March 2020). There were 12,307 responses and 7,764 questionnaires were completed in full. RESULTS: Higher preventive behaviour was found in individuals who experienced greater psychological distress, were more anxious, and expressed greater perceived infectability and germ aversion. Greater compliance with preventive behaviour was found among women, those sharing a household with people aged over 65, the elderly and those who knew somebody who had been infected. These groups also showed higher anxiety levels, which appeared to be significantly increased in general as a result of the specific situation. Quarantine was evaluated as the most efficient preventive measure, and was respected relatively strictly even before it became an officially announced protective measure. CONCLUSION: This research reveals a strong association between preventive behaviour and anxiety. Anxiety, together with social distancing, may affect physical and psychological health in the population in the long term. Other aspects of public health might therefore be influenced by the measures currently being enforced to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2.","Velikonja, Nevenka Kregar; Erjavec, Karmen; Verdenik, Ivan; Hussein, Mohsen; Velikonja, Vislava Globevnik",Zdr Varst,79,12

Despite its high efficiency against nematodes and arthropods, IVM may pose a threat to the environment due to its ecotoxcity. In this study, degradation of IVM by a newly isolated bacterium Aeromonas taiwanensis ZJB-18,044 was investigated. Strain ZJB-18,044 can completely degrade 50 mg/L IVM in 5 d with a biodegradation ability of 0.42 mg/L/h. Meanwhile, it exhibited high tolerance (50 mg/L) to doramectin, emamectin, rifampicin, and spiramycin. It can also efficiently degrade doramectin, emamectin, and spiramycin. The IVM degradation of strain ZJB-18,044 can be inhibited by erythromycin, azithromycin, spiramycin or rifampicin. However, supplement of carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, an uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation, can partially recover the IVM degradation. Moreover, strain ZJB-18,044 cells can pump out excess IVM to maintain a low intracellular IVM concentration. Therefore, the IVM tolerance of strain ZJB-18,044 may be due to the regulation of the intracellular IVM concentration by the activated macrolide efflux pump(s). With the high IVM degradation efficiency, A. taiwanensis ZJB-18,044 may serve as a bioremediation agent for IVM and other macrolides in the environment.

EHEC are associated with diarrhoea and dysentery in humans and in ruminants, mainly calves from two to eight weeks of age. Clinical signs and/or lesions have been reproduced experimentally with EHEC strains belonging to serotypes O5:K4/Nm, O26:K-:H11, O111:Nm, and O157:H7 which are isolated from cattle and/or humans. The purpose of this work was to develop an experimental model of infection in newborn calves with a bovine EHEC strain isolated from a calf which of died of diarrhoea, and belonging to the O118:H16 serotype, which is also common to both cattle and humans. The bovine O118:H16 EHEC strain was able to colonize the gut of three newborn calves, and to induce diarrhoea twenty-four hours after challenge and to produce AE lesions in the small and/or large intestines. AE lesions were detected microscopically and ultrastructurally in the small intestine of one calf and in the whole intestinal track of two calves. Internalization of bacteria and also of pedestal-bacteria complex inside of the enterocyte was observed in two of the three calves. The significance of this stage is unknown but may be related to the invasion of the calf by the bacteria. The challenge strain was isolated from the mesenteric lymph nodes of the same two calves but not from other organs or from heart blood. No blood was observed in the faeces of any of the three calves, nor were any lesions in the internal organs, which may have been related to the production of a verotoxin whose role is still unknown in cattle.","Stordeur, Philippe; China, Bernard; Charlier, Gerard; Roels, Stefan; Mainil, Jacques",Microbes Infect,79,24

In addition, the demand for seasonal products (such as fashion apparels, beverages etc.) or perishable goods (such as meat and seafood, dairy products, fruit and vegetables, pharmaceutical products, and chemicals) decreases over time. Hence, demand is a function of price and stock-age. With large business transactions, a seller usually demands a down payment (i.e., an advance payment) to ensure that the buyer is making a serious offer. Conversely, a buyer frequently requests to hold a fraction of total purchase cost until the business transaction is completed and satisfactory (i.e., a credit payment). As a result, a combination of advance, cash, and credit (ACC) payments is commonly used in business transactions. This paper develops a supplier–retailer–customer chain in which the retailer receives an upstream ACC payment from the supplier while in return offers a down-stream cash-credit (some in cash and the remainder in credit) payment to customers, the demand is influenced by the combined effect of selling price and stock age, and the deterioration rate is time-varying. The retailer must determine optimal unit price and replenishment time to maximize the present value of total profit, which is strictly concave in selling price and strictly pseudo-concave in replenishment time. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is performed, and several managerial insights are obtained. For instance, an increase in the fraction of advance payment forces the retailer to raise selling price.","Li, Ruihai; Teng, Jinn-Tsair; Chang, Chun-Tao",Ann Oper Res,79,29

The coronavirus spike proteins are very effective molecular mechanisms, which provide the coronavirus entrance to the host cell. The number of these spikes is different; it dramatically depends on external conditions and determines the degree of danger of the virus. A larger number of spike proteins makes the virus infectivity stronger. This paper describes a mathematical model of the shape of coronavirus virions. Based on this model, the characteristics of light scattered by the coronavirus virions were calculated. It was found two main features of coronavirus model particles in the spectral region near 200 nm: a minimum of intensity and a sharp leap of the linear polarization degree. The effect of the spike protein number on the intensity and polarization properties of the scattered light was studied. It was determined that when the number of spike proteins decreases, both the intensity minimum and the position of the linear polarization leap shift to shorter wavelengths. This allows us to better evaluate the shape of the coronavirus virion, and, therefore, the infectious danger of the virus. It was shown that the shorter the wavelength of scattered light, the more reliably one can distinguish viruses from non-viruses. The developed model and the light scattering simulations based on it can be applied not only to coronaviruses, but also to other objects of a similar structure, for example, pollen.","Petrov, Dmitry",J Quant Spectrosc Radiat Transf,79,28

Reverse logistics is a waste management strategy whose application to public pharmaceutical care processes faces legal restrictions and incertitude. Nevertheless, reverse logistics of end-of-use and end-of-life medicines may be both a saving and an environmental strategy in developing countries that manage health under limited resources. How to overcome restrictions to reverse logistics mainly in the context of primary health level? This study aims to investigate the most relevant critical factors for implementing medicine waste management in pharmaceutical care process. The unit analysis is the primary health level process in a developing country capital. Considering the characteristics of the issue at hand, it was designed a qualitative study. Data was collected through semi-structured interviews. The interviewees were key individuals who work directly with the process—from administering medicine to patients to managing waste at the end of the medicine’s lifespan or after its use. Results indicated that despite reverse logistics arising from end users is legally forbidden, another type of reverse flow emerged from process analysis. The reverse flow, named reassignment flow, consists of still useful end-of-use medicines exchanged among the 10 government-ran pharmacies and over 140 health centers, where healthcare professionals administer and offer guidance on how to use them correctly. Another result was the identification of the most critical factors in implementing reverse logistics strategies in the public management context. The factors mentioned included aspects pertaining to management, information technology, infrastructure, and government, but they differ from the private context management, in which decision-makers has more freedom. Due to the barriers named by interviewees, the political barriers and complexity of primary health system, results of this investigation point to (i) reinforcing the reassignment flows inside pharmaceutical care logistics cycle, for saving purposes, and (ii) further development of a specific management unit to perform reverse logistics of end-of-use medicines arising from consumers, for environmental purposes. In times of shortage or resources caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, to know the critical factors is a step necessary in overcoming the current restrictions in direction of a well-succeeded medicines reverse logistics, either of reassignment or from final consumers. These results clarify the literature on end-of-use and end-of-life medicines reverse logistics. It also provides managers of 5000 municipalities in the country a perspective on the most relevant critical factors involved in their decision-making process, concerning the reuse of end-of-use medicines or the adequate disposal of end-of-life medicines in the environment.

The results showed that canine parainfluenza virus (CPIV) was the most commonly detected CIRD pathogen, followed by canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV), Bordetella bronchiseptica, Mycoplasma cynos, Mycoplasma canis and canine pneumovirus (CnPnV). Some classical CIRD agents, such as canine adenoviruses, canine distemper virus and canid herpesvirus 1, were not detected at all, as were not other emerging respiratory viruses (canine influenza virus, canine hepacivirus) and bacteria (Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus). Most severe forms of respiratory disease were observed in the presence of CPIV, CRCoV and M. cynos alone or in combination with other pathogens, whereas single CnPnV or M. canis infections were detected in dogs with no or very mild respiratory signs. Interestingly, only the association of M. cynos (alone or in combination with either CRCoV or M. canis) with severe clinical forms was statistically significant.

METHODS: A retrospective multicentre ecological analysis was undertaken evaluating all blood cultures taken from adults from 01 April 2017 to 30 April 2020 across five acute hospitals in London. Linear trend analysis and ARIMA models allowing for seasonality were used to look for significant variation. RESULTS: One hundred nineteen thousand five hundred eighty-four blood cultures were included. At the height of the UK SARS-CoV-2 first wave in April 2020, Enterobacterales bacteraemias were at an historic low across two London trusts (63/3814, 1.65%), whilst all CoNS BSI were at an historic high (173/3814, 4.25%). This differed significantly for both Enterobacterales (p = 0.013), CoNS central line associated BSIs (CLABSI) (p < 0.01) and CoNS non-CLABSI (p < 0.01), when compared with prior periods, even allowing for seasonal variation. S. pneumoniae (p = 0.631) and S. aureus (p = 0.617) BSI did not vary significant throughout the study period. CONCLUSIONS: Significantly fewer than expected Enterobacterales BSI occurred during the UK peak of the COVID-19 pandemic; identifying potential causes, including potential unintended consequences of national self-isolation public health messaging, is essential. High rates of CoNS BSI, with evidence of increased CLABSI, but also likely contamination associated with increased use of personal protective equipment, may result in inappropriate antimicrobial use and indicates a clear area for intervention during further waves.

We investigated the immunogenicity of the full-length and shorter fragments of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein, and the crossreactivity of antibodies with HCoV. We identified a C-terminus region in SARS-CoV2 N of minimal sequence homology with HCoV that was more specific for SARS-CoV-2 and highly immunogenic. IgGs to the full-length SARS-CoV-2 N also recognized N229E N, and IgGs to HKU1 N recognized SARS-CoV-2 N. Crossreactivity with SARS-CoV-2 was stronger for alpha- rather than beta-HCoV despite having less sequence identity, revealing the importance of conformational recognition. Higher preexisting IgG to OC43 N correlated with lower IgG to SARS-CoV-2 N in rRT-PCR negative individuals, reflecting less exposure and indicating a potential protective association. Antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 N were higher in patients with more severe and longer duration of symptoms and in females. IgGs remained stable for at least 3 months, while IgAs and IgMs declined faster. In conclusion, N protein is a primary target of SARS-CoV-2-specific and HCoV crossreactive antibodies, both of which may affect the acquisition of immunity to COVID-19.","Dobaño, Carlota; Santano, Rebeca; Jiménez, Alfons; Vidal, Marta; Chi, Jordi; Rodrigo Melero, Natalia; Popovic, Matija; López-Aladid, Rubén; Fernández-Barat, Laia; Tortajada, Marta; Carmona-Torre, Francisco; Reina, Gabriel; Torres, Antoni; Mayor, Alfredo; Carolis, Carlo; García-Basteiro, Alberto L.; Aguilar, Ruth; Moncunill, Gemma; Izquierdo, Luis",Transl Res,79,30

PURPOSE: To explore pharmacy learner (eg, resident, fellow) and educator (eg, residency program director, preceptor) experiences and lessons learned during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. METHODS: In May 2020, attendees of the virtual Research in Education and Practice Symposium (REPS) were invited to participate in two 1-hour networking sessions. During these sessions, participants completed individual and group reflection exercises during which they were asked questions about their experiences during the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants who volunteered submitted their responses through an electronic survey application. Anonymous responses were coded using thematic analysis to address the research questions. RESULTS: Sixty-eight and 38 participants, respectively, attended the 2 networking discussions. Participant-identified professional impacts of the COVID-19 crisis included unexpected learning experiences, greater adaptability, workflow and learning interruptions, and decreased productivity. Personal impacts included a greater focus on well-being, physical and social isolation, and changes in travel plans. Participants noted positive and negative emotions including acceptance, encouragement, anxiety, stress, and frustration. The main lessons learned focused on adaptability, gratitude, and empathy. Participants indicated that they would have from foreknowledge of the anticipated duration of the pandemic, associated workflow changes, and the reliance on technology the pandemic would engender. In addition, they predicted that pharmacy practice will require changes to workflow flexibility, training expectations, the pharmacist’s role, and organizational structure. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has positively and negatively impacted the professional and personal lives of pharmacy learners and educators, with the most notable impacts being in the areas of well-being and adaptability.

We estimated diversity of each site on a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of the Spike (S) proteins from close relatives of SARS-CoV-2 that infected bat and pangolin before the pandemic. Then we compared the locations of high diversity sites in this MSA and those of mutations found in multiple emerging lineages of human-infecting SARS-CoV-2. This comparison revealed a significant correspondence, which suggests that a limited number of sites in this protein are repeatedly substituted in different lineages of this group of viruses. It follows, therefore, that the sites of future emerging mutations in SARS-CoV-2 can be predicted by analyzing their relatives (outgroups) that have infected non-human hosts. We discuss a possible evolutionary basis for these substitutions and provide a list of frequently substituted sites that potentially include future emerging variants in SARS-CoV-2.","Katoh, Kazutaka; Standley, Daron M.",Commun Biol,79,3

However, during the pandemic, many renal patients were unable to ‘shield’ fully due to the ongoing need to attend the dialysis unit for treatment. With a significant proportion of our haemodialysis population coming from socially deprived and ethnic minority background (38%), we aimed to explore patients’ understanding and experience of COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: This was a cross-sectional survey of patients receiving in-centre haemodialysis from one centre in England conducted during July 2020, three months after the first UK national lockdown. The questionnaire consisted of 18 questions exploring patients’ awareness of COVID-19 pandemic, understanding of ‘shielding’, use of face covering, and their experience of haemodialysis treatment as well as accessing healthcare during COVID-19 pandemic. Those with language barriers were offered assistance and verbal translation by haemodialysis nurses, if possible, to complete the questionnaire. RESULTS: In total, 232 patients (of a total of 479 in-centre dialysis patients, 48% response rate) completed and returned the questionnaire. Of these, 29 (12.5%) patients required help with the questionnaire due to language barrier. Mean age was 62 (SD 16) years, 63% were male, 53% were from ethnic minorities and 45% were from the most deprived area (MDI Decile 1). A third of the respondents lived with 3 or more adults at home and a quarter lived with one or more child. Majority of the patients (97%) were aware of COVID-19 pandemic, and most received information on COVID-19 from the news (87%). Dialysis staff (43.1%), family and friends (32.6%), internet (31%) and general practitioners (20.3%) were also key sources of information. Despite this, 17.2% of the patients did not know about ‘shielding’. Even though 3 in 4 patients stated that they were ‘always’ or ‘often’ able to ‘shield’, when prompted with scenarios, significant number of patients in fact felt that they were unable to shield when travelling to dialysis (56%), during dialysis (35%) or when shopping (17%). Majority of the patients (89%) said that they wore face covering and 28% self-isolated from the rest of household during the first peak of pandemic. 83% practised ‘social distancing’ at dialysis units but 5% did not and 6% felt unable to do so. Almost a quarter of the patients (23%, 54 patients) felt unwell during the first wave of COVID-19. Majority (50%) of them sought medical help by informing the dialysis unit, whilst 26% contacted their GP and 38% attended emergency departments. Of these 54 patients, 35% had difficulties accessing medical help, especially from primary care. One in four patients felt that their dialysis experience had changed during the pandemic: 10% increased use of private taxis or used different travel services, 3.5% reported increased travel time, 8% dialysed at a different unit, 5% experienced longer waiting time to start dialysis sessions and 4% had dialysis frequency reduced . Almost a third (29%) of the patients knew of someone in the dialysis unit who had COVID-19 infection during the first wave of pandemic. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 posed significant challenges for patients receiving in-centre haemodialysis. Despite their high susceptibility to severe COVID infection, significant number of patients was not aware of ‘shielding’ or able to ‘shield’ effectively. Some also experienced difficulties accessing medical help and a quarter reported change of transport or dialysis arrangement during the pandemic.","Ng, Khai Ping; Crowley, Lisa; Aggarwal, Yogita; Baharani, Jyoti",Nephrol Dial Transplant,79,20

The aim of the present study was to examine associations between the perceptions of information overload and wellbeing in China during the initial phase of COVID-19. (2) Methods: The present research involved a cross-sectional online survey, which controlled for established predictors of wellbeing and the perception of general (not COVID-19-specific) information overload. The setting of the research was China, February 2020. A total of 1349 participants completed an online survey, and the results from 1240 members of the general public who stated that they were uninfected are reported here (55.6% female; 49.4% single; age distribution: 17–25 years: 26%; 26–30 years: 24.3%; 31–40 years: 23.9%; 41–50 years: 16.2%; 51 years+: 9.6%; the most frequent occupations were: 21.5% students; 19.5% teachers; 25.9% office workers; 10.8% managers, plus a few in a wide range of jobs). The outcomes were positive wellbeing (positive affect and life satisfaction) and negative wellbeing (stress, negative affect, anxiety and depression). (3) Results: Regressions were carried out, controlling for established predictors of wellbeing (psychological capital, general information overload, positive and negative coping). Spending time getting information about COVID-19 was associated with more positive wellbeing. In contrast, perceptions of COVID-19 information overload and feeling panic due to COVID-19 were associated with more negative wellbeing. (4) Conclusions: These results have implications for the communication of information about COVID-19 to the general public and form the basis for further research on the topic.","Fan, Jialin; Smith, Andrew P.",Behav Sci (Basel),79,16

A common feature among positive-strand RNA viruses is their assembly of replication-transcription complexes in association with cytoplasmic membranes. Upon infection, coronaviruses extensively rearrange cellular membranes into organelle-like replicative structures that consist of double-membrane vesicles and convoluted membranes to which the nonstructural proteins involved in RNA synthesis localize. Double-stranded RNA, presumably functioning as replicative intermediate during viral RNA synthesis, has been detected at the double-membrane vesicle interior. Recent studies have provided new insights into the assembly and functioning of the coronavirus replicative structures. This review will summarize the current knowledge on the biogenesis of the replicative structures, the membrane anchoring of the replication-transcription complexes, and the location of viral RNA synthesis, with particular focus on the dynamics of the coronavirus replicative structures and individual replication-associated proteins.","Hagemeijer, Marne C.; Rottier, Peter J.M.; de Haan, Cornelis A.M.",Viruses,79,18

The approach to these infections begins with a basic understanding of the pathophysiology of the respiratory tract and how immune defences interact with pathogens. A number of distinct clinical syndromes can be defined which help physicians and clinical microbiologists develop a differential diagnosis of potential infecting pathogens. The type and severity of infection is often modulated by the medical characteristics of the patient, circumstances surrounding infection, geography and environmental exposures. Multiple laboratory test methodologies are available to aid clinical diagnosis and close communication between clinicians and laboratory personnel can optimise the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of diagnosis.

Since March 2020 a large number of people in the UK have been regularly doing unpaid activities to benefit others besides their close relatives. Although most mutual aid groups emerged from local neighbourhoods and communities, official public institutions also fostered community volunteering, namely through the community champions scheme. By considering a broad definition of COVID-19 volunteering, this article describes a systematic review of the literature focused on one broad question: What have we learned about COVID-19 volunteering both at the UK national level and the more local community level? METHODS: A rapid review of the literature in peer-reviewed databases and grey literature was applied in our search, following the PRISMA principles. The search was conducted from 10 to 16 of October 2020, and sources were included on the basis of having been published between January and October 2020, focusing on COVID-19 and addressing community groups, volunteering groups, volunteers, or community champions in the UK. RESULTS: After initial screening, a total of 40 relevant sources were identified. From these, 27 were considered eligible. Findings suggest that food shopping and emotional support were the most common activities, but there were diverse models of organisation and coordination in COVID-19 volunteering. Additionally, community support groups seem to be adjusting their activities and scope of action to current needs and challenges. Volunteers were mostly women, middle-class, highly educated, and working-age people. Social networks and connections, local knowledge, and social trust were key dimensions associated with community organising and volunteering. Furthermore, despite the efforts of a few official public institutions and councils, there has been limited community engagement and collaboration with volunteering groups and other community-based organisations. CONCLUSIONS: We identified important factors for fostering community engagement and COVID-19 volunteering as well as gaps in the current literature. We suggest that future research should be directed towards deepening knowledge on sustaining community engagement, collaboration and community participation over time, during and beyond this pandemic.","Mao, Guanlan; Fernandes-Jesus, Maria; Ntontis, Evangelos; Drury, John",BMC Public Health,79,20

For this proposal, an interview was carried out in a sample of 245 participants who volunteered to participate in the study. The sample was divided into Spanish non-migrants, Spanish migrants, non-Spanish migrants and refugees. Attitudes towards COVID-19, resilience (based on BRCS) and mental health (based on DASS-21) were measured. The results obtained can be described as follows: (i) Migrant participants indicated worse mental health than non-migrants, and within the migrant group, refugees presented worse scores; (ii) No differences were found in attitudes towards COVID-19 in any of the subgroups; (iii) A moderating effect of group was found for the relationship between resilience and mental health but not between resilience and fear of COVID-19.

Still, it remains largely unknown how renal insufficiency and immunosuppressive medication affect development of vaccine-induced immunity. We therefore comprehensively analyzed humoral and cellular responses in kidney transplant recipients after the standard second vaccination dose. As opposed to all healthy vaccinees and the majority of hemodialysis patients, only 4 of 39 and 1 of 39 transplanted individuals showed IgA and IgG seroconversion at day 8 ± 1 after booster immunization, with minor changes until day 23 ± 5, respectively. Although most transplanted patients mounted spike-specific T helper cell responses, frequencies were significantly reduced compared with those in controls and dialysis patients and this was accompanied by a broad impairment in effector cytokine production, memory differentiation, and activation-related signatures. Spike-specific CD8+ T cell responses were less abundant than their CD4+ counterparts in healthy controls and hemodialysis patients and almost undetectable in transplant patients. Promotion of anti-HLA antibodies or acute rejection was not detected after vaccination.

However, their efforts and health status have not been well documented. We aimed to investigate the working conditions and health status of front line public health workers in China during the COVID-19 epidemic. METHODS: Between 18 February and 1 March 2020, we conducted an online cross-sectional survey of 2,313 CDC workers and 4,004 PHI workers in five provinces across China experiencing different scales of COVID-19 epidemic. We surveyed all participants about their work conditions, roles, burdens, perceptions, mental health, and self-rated health using a self-constructed questionnaire and standardised measurements (i.e., Patient Health Questionnaire and General Anxiety Disorder scale). To examine the independent associations between working conditions and health outcomes, we used multivariate regression models controlling for potential confounders. RESULTS: The prevalence of depression, anxiety, and poor self-rated health was 21.3, 19.0, and 9.8%, respectively, among public health workers (27.1, 20.6, and 15.0% among CDC workers and 17.5, 17.9, and 6.8% among PHI workers).

Here, we provide a quantitative framework to determine which interventions are likely to have the most impact in which settings. We introduce the concept of ""event R"", the expected number of new infections due to the presence of a single infected individual at an event. We obtain a fundamental relationship between event R and four parameters: transmission intensity, duration of exposure, the proximity of individuals, and the degree of mixing. We use reports of small outbreaks to establish event R and transmission intensity in a range of settings. We identify principles that guide whether physical distancing, masks and other barriers to transmission, or social bubbles will be most effective. We outline how this information can be obtained and used to re-open economies with principled measures to reduce COVID-19 transmission.","Tupper, P.; Yerlanov, M.; Boury, H.; Colijn, C.",,79,33

We aimed to test if contrast enhancement affects short-term renal function in hospitalized COVID − 19 patients. METHODS: Plasma creatinine (P-creatinine) was measured on the day of computed tomography (CT) and 24 h, 48 h, and 4–10 days after CT. Contrast-enhanced (n = 142) and unenhanced (n = 24) groups were subdivided, based on estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFR), > 60 and ≤ 60 ml/min/1.73 m(2). Contrast-induced acute renal failure (CI-AKI) was defined as ≥27 μmol/L increase or a > 50% rise in P-creatinine from CT or initiation of renal replacement therapy during follow-up. Patients with renal replacement therapy were studied separately. We evaluated factors associated with a > 50% rise in P-creatinine at 48 h and at 4–10 days after contrast-enhanced CT. RESULTS: Median P-creatinine at 24–48 h and days 4–10 post-CT in patients with eGFR> 60 and eGFR≥30–60 in contrast-enhanced and unenhanced groups did not differ from basal values. CI-AKI was observed at 48 h and at 4–10 days post contrast administration in 24 and 36% (n = 5/14) of patients with eGFR≥30–60. Corresponding figures in the eGFR> 60 contrast-enhanced CT group were 5 and 5% respectively, (p < 0.037 and p < 0.001, Pearson χ(2) test). In the former group, four of the five patients died within 30 days. Odds ratio analysis showed that an eGFR≥30–60 and 30-day mortality were associated with CK-AKI both at 48 h and 4–10 days after contrast-enhanced CT. CONCLUSION: Patients with COVID − 19 and eGFR≥30–60 had a high frequency of CK-AKI at 48 h and at 4–10 days after contrast administration, which was associated with increased 30-day mortality. For patients with eGFR≥30–60, we recommend strict indications are practiced for contrast-enhanced CT.

CDC examined COVID-19 vaccine administration and 2018 CDC social vulnerability index (SVI) data to ascertain whether inequities in COVID-19 vaccination coverage with respect to county-level SVI have persisted, overall and by urbanicity. Vaccination coverage was defined as the number of persons aged ≥18 years (adults) who had received ≥1 dose of any Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-authorized COVID-19 vaccine divided by the total adult population in a specified SVI category.† SVI was examined overall and by its four themes (socioeconomic status, household composition and disability, racial/ethnic minority status and language, and housing type and transportation). Counties were categorized into SVI quartiles, in which quartile 1 (Q1) represented the lowest level of vulnerability and quartile 4 (Q4), the highest. Trends in vaccination coverage were assessed by SVI quartile and urbanicity, which was categorized as large central metropolitan, large fringe metropolitan (areas surrounding large cities, e.g., suburban), medium and small metropolitan, and nonmetropolitan counties.§ During December 14, 2020-May 1, 2021, disparities in vaccination coverage by SVI increased, especially in large fringe metropolitan (e.g., suburban) and nonmetropolitan counties. By May 1, 2021, vaccination coverage was lower among adults living in counties with the highest overall SVI; differences were most pronounced in large fringe metropolitan (Q4 coverage = 45.0% versus Q1 coverage = 61.7%) and nonmetropolitan (Q4 = 40.6% versus Q1 = 52.9%) counties. Vaccination coverage disparities were largest for two SVI themes: socioeconomic status (Q4 = 44.3% versus Q1 = 61.0%) and household composition and disability (Q4 = 42.0% versus Q1 = 60.1%). Outreach efforts, including expanding public health messaging tailored to local populations and increasing vaccination access, could help increase vaccination coverage in high-SVI counties.","Barry, Vaughn; Dasgupta, Sharoda; Weller, Daniel L.; Kriss, Jennifer L.; Cadwell, Betsy L.; Rose, Charles; Pingali, Cassandra; Musial, Trieste; Sharpe, J.

Viral miRNAs (v-miRNAs) encoded by both DNA and RNA viruses induce immune dysregulation, virus production, and disease pathogenesis. Given the absence of effective treatment and the prevalence of highly infective SARS-CoV-2 strains, improved understanding of viral-associated miRNAs could provide novel mechanistic insights into the pathogenesis of COVID-19. In this study, SARS-CoV-2 v-miRNAs were identified by deep sequencing in infected Calu-3 and Vero E6 cell lines. Among the ~0.1% small RNA sequences mapped to the SARS-CoV-2 genome, the top ten SARS-CoV-2 v-miRNAs (including three encoded by the N gene; v-miRNA-N) were selected. After initial screening of conserved v-miRNA-N-28612, which was identified in both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, its expression was shown to be positively associated with viral load in COVID-19 patients. Further in silico analysis and synthetic-mimic transfection of validated SARS-CoV-2 v-miRNAs revealed novel functional targets and associations with mechanisms of cellular metabolism and biosynthesis. Our findings support the development of v-miRNA-based biomarkers and therapeutic strategies based on improved understanding of the pathophysiology of COVID-19.","Meng, Fei; Siu, Gilman Kit-Hang; Mok, Bobo Wing-Yee; Sun, Jiahong; Fung, Kitty S.

Therefore, we investigated the rate of pediatric infection–related hospitalizations during the COVID-19 pandemic. We used a retrospective cohort design and included all Danish children < 18 years. Infection-related hospitalizations were assessed during study periods in 2020 vs. 2018/2019, and we computed incidence rate ratios (IRRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using Poisson regression. In the 2020 study period, 3093 children were hospitalized with an infection, while the corresponding figures for 2018 and 2019 study periods were 4824 and 3830, respectively. When comparing the 2020 to the 2018/2019 study period prior to nationwide lockdown, we observed a decline in infection-related hospitalizations (12.68 (95% CI, 12.22–13.16) vs. 15.49 (95% CI, 15.12–15.86) per 1000 person-years). We further observed decreased IRRs, especially during the lockdown period (week 11: 0.64 (95% CI, 0.55–0.75); week 12: 0.26 (95% CI, 0.21–0.33); week 13: 0.13 (95% CI, 0.10–0.19)). Conclusion: The rate of pediatric infection-related hospitalizations in Denmark declined during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 compared to that in 2018/2019, with a 36% decline during initiation of the nationwide lockdown period.

It is inevitable that a series of psychiatric patients who display alcohol disorders will be admitted to hospital while also suffering from health conditions, such as liver disease, due to the consumption of alcohol. Managing comorbid patients in a psychiatric facility is a delicate matter that requires a collaborative team. The aim of this systematic paper is to highlight the following: The possibility of treating alcohol use disorder (AUD) and alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) overlapping alcohol liver disease (ALD) within a psychiatric institution, and the importance of a collaborative multidisciplinary team; correctly dosing psychoactive medication when metabolism is affected by ALD; deciding when is it necessary to seek a transfer to a general hospital. Prescribing medication in patients suffering from ALD is still a not a fully documented territory. Protein binding, metabolism, bioavailability, extraction ratios, excretion route, and half-life must be taken into consideration as well as frequently repeating liver panels. Studies suggest that short-acting benzodiazepines are preferred over their alternatives when treating AWS in ALD. All anticonvulsants can be used in patients with decompensated liver disease with caution, although newer generation antiepileptic agents should be first line. Propofol is favored to benzodiazepines or opioids in the case of decompensated cirrhosis. Patients with ALD are likely to be further compromised by the potential hepatocytotoxicity of some pharmacological agents. On that account, having an integrated perspective of the medical case while taking into consideration the underlying illness as well as possible drug interaction is crucial in treating AUD or AWS in a psychiatric institution.","Trifu, Simona; Țîbîrnă, Andrian; Costea, Radu-Virgil; Popescu, Alexandra",Exp Ther Med,79,18

AIM: To summarize antimicrobial resistance and assess the frequency of community-associated infections (CAIs) and healthcare-associated infections (HCAIs) due to AMR pathogens in Dongguan city, China. METHODS: Seven acute care hospitals provided antimicrobial susceptibility data for 2017, from which ‘bug–drug’ combinations were analysed. To calculate incidence proportions of CAI and incidence densities of HCAI, data from three tertiary care hospitals were merged with patient data, obtained from the Dongguan Nosocomial Infection Surveillance System. FINDINGS: A total of 16,548 pathogens were analysed. Non-susceptibility to third-generation cephalosporins (3GCs) in Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae was 43.9% and 30.2%, respectively. Non-susceptibility to carbapenems in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii was 29.5% and 50.9%, respectively. A quarter of Staphylococcus aureus (26.3%) were non-susceptible to oxacillin. The incidence density of HCAI due to E. coli non-susceptible to 3GCs and fluoroquinolones combined was 0.09 (95% confidence interval: 0.07–0.11) per 1000 patient-days. Both E. coli and K. pneumoniae were the predominant pathogens isolated from blood. Compared with the 2017 European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network report, the incidence proportion of bloodstream infections due to multidrug-resistant E. coli was significantly higher (14.9% and 4.6%, respectively). CONCLUSION: The incidence of non-susceptible bug–drug combinations in Dongguan city was lower compared with China as a whole. Non-susceptible bug–drug combinations were significantly more frequent in HCAI compared with CAI. The incidence proportion of bloodstream infections due to multidrug-resistant pathogens in Dongguan City was higher compared with Europe.","Wang, J.; Zhou, M.; Huang, G.; Guo, Z.; Sauser, J.; Metsini, A.; Pittet, D.; Zingg, W.",J Hosp Infect,79,0

METHODS: We conducted a monocenter retrospective study comparing the incidence of VAP and invasive aspergillosis between patients with COVID-19-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (C-ARDS) and those with non-SARS-CoV-2 viral ARDS (NC-ARDS). RESULTS: We assessed 90 C-ARDS and 82 NC-ARDS patients, who were mechanically ventilated for more than 48 h. At ICU admission, there were significantly fewer bacterial coinfections documented in C-ARDS than in NC-ARDS: 14 (16%) vs 38 (48%), p < 0.01. Conversely, significantly more patients developed at least one VAP episode in C-ARDS as compared with NC-ARDS: 58 (64%) vs. 36 (44%), p = 0.007. The probability of VAP was significantly higher in C-ARDS after adjusting on death and ventilator weaning [sub-hazard ratio = 1.72 (1.14–2.52), p < 0.01]. The incidence of multi-drug-resistant bacteria (MDR)-related VAP was significantly higher in C-ARDS than in NC-ARDS: 21 (23%) vs. 9 (11%), p = 0.03. Carbapenem was more used in C-ARDS than in NC-ARDS: 48 (53%), vs 21 (26%), p < 0.01. According to AspICU algorithm, there were fewer cases of putative aspergillosis in C-ARDS than in NC-ARDS [2 (2%) vs. 12 (15%), p = 0.003], but there was no difference in Aspergillus colonization.

The electrically-driven transport of free ions under such conditions is far from being understood. In this paper, we determine experimentally whether the above-mentioned deviation from isotropy affects the electric charge transport across the liquid. To this end, we measure the electrical conductivity in the flow (stretching) direction of the cylindrical liquid filament formed in the elasto-capillary thinning that arises during the breakup of a viscoelastic liquid bridge. First, we examine the behavior of monodisperse solutions of polyethylene oxide (PEO) in a mixture of glycerine and water. For all the concentrations and molecular weights considered, the filament conductivity remains practically the same as the isotropic conductivity measured under hydrostatic conditions. However, we observe a decrease in the electric current at the end of elasto-capillary regime which may partially be attributed to the reduction of the liquid conductivity. Then, we measure the conductivity of bidisperse solutions of PEO with very different molecular weights. In this case, a significant decrease in conductivity is observed as the filament radius decreases. This constitutes the first experimental evidence of ion mobility reduction in stretching viscoelastic filaments, a relevant effect in applications such as electrospinning.","Rubio, Manuel; Sadek, Samir; Vega, Emilio José; Gañán-Calvo, Alfonso Miguel; Montanero, José María",Materials (Basel),79,1

Here we provide new information regarding a pathogenic schistosome trematode parasite of both wild and domestic mammals that has recently expanded its known range from mesic/wet environments of the southeastern United States to the arid southwest. In 2018, 12 dogs living near a man-made pond in Moab, Utah, were found positive for Heterobilharzia americana, the most westerly report of this endemic North American schistosome, and the first from Utah. Raccoon scats collected near the pond were positive for H. americana eggs, and snails living near the pond's water line identified as Galba humilis shed H. americana cercariae, the first indication of natural infections in this widespread North American snail species. The susceptibility of G. humilis to H. americana was confirmed experimentally. Our studies support the existence of two variants of H. americana and emphasize the need for further investigations of lymnaeids and their compatibility with H. americana, to better define the future potential for its spread. Capture of a new species of intermediate host vector snail and construction of man-made habitats suitable for this snail have created the potential for a much more widespread animal health problem, especially for dogs and horses. H. americana will prove difficult to control because of the role of raccoons in maintaining transmission and the amphibious habits of the snail hosts of this pathogenic schistosome.","Loker, Eric S.; Dolginow, Scott Z.; Pape, Suzanne; Topper, Colin D.; Alda, Pilar; Pointier, Jean P.; Ebbs, Erika T.; Sanchez, Melissa C.; Verocai, Guilherme G.; DeJong, Randall J.; Brant, Sara V.; Laidemitt, Martina R.",One Health,79,16

Large vessel occlusion, as well as malignant cerebral stroke have been described in COVID-19 patients. In the following months, given the increase in COVID-19 cases, an increase in malignant cerebral SARS-CoV2 associated strokes are expected. The baseline situation of the patients as well as the risk of evolution to a serious disease due to the virus, depict a unique scenario. Decompressive craniectomy is a life-saving procedure indicated in patients who suffer a malignant cerebral stroke; however, it is unclear whether the same eligibility criteria should be used for patients with COVID-19. To our knowledge seven cases of decompressive craniectomy and malignant cerebral stroke have been described to date. We report on a 39-year-old female with no major risk factors for cerebrovascular disease, apart from oral contraception, and mild COVID-19 symptoms who suffered from left hemispheric syndrome. The patient underwent endovascular treatment with stenting and afterward decompressive craniectomy due to a worsening neurological status with unilateral unreactive mydriasis. We present the case and provide a comprehensive review of the available literature related to the surgical treatment for COVID-19 associated malignant strokes, to establish whether the same eligibility criteria for non-COVID-19 associated strokes should be used. Eight patients, including our case, were surgically managed due to malignant cerebral stroke. Seven of these patients received decompressive craniectomy, and six of them met the eligibility criteria of the current stroke guidelines. The mortality rate was 33%, similar to that described in non-COVID-19 cases. Two patients had a left middle cerebral artery (MCA) and both survived after decompressive craniectomy. Our results support that decompressive craniectomy, using the current stroke guidelines, should be considered an effective life-saving treatment for COVID-19-related malignant cerebral strokes.","Sáez-Alegre, Miguel; García-Feijoo, Pablo; Millán, Pablo; Vivancos Sánchez, Catalina; Rodríguez Domínguez, Víctor; García Nerín, Jorge; Isla Guerrero, Alberto; Gandía-González, María Luisa",Front Neurol,79,6

However, due to the low viral load specimens and the limitations of RT-PCR, significant numbers of false negative reports are inevitable, which results in failure to timely diagnose, cut off transmission, and assess discharge criteria. To improve this situation, an optimized droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) was used for detection of SARS-CoV-2, which showed that the limit of detection of ddPCR is significantly lower than that of RT-PCR. We further explored the feasibility of ddPCR to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA from 77 patients, and compared with RT-PCR in terms of the diagnostic accuracy based on the results of follow-up survey. 26 patients of COVID-19 with negative RT-PCR reports were reported as positive by ddPCR. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, negative likelihood ratio (NLR) and accuracy were improved from 40% (95% CI: 27–55%), 100% (95% CI: 54–100%), 100%, 16% (95% CI: 13–19%), 0.6 (95% CI: 0.48–0.75) and 47% (95% CI: 33–60%) for RT-PCR to 94% (95% CI: 83–99%), 100% (95% CI: 48–100%), 100%, 63% (95% CI: 36–83%), 0.06 (95% CI: 0.02–0.18), and 95% (95% CI: 84–99%) for ddPCR, respectively. Moreover, 6/14 (42.9%) convalescents were detected as positive by ddPCR at 5–12 days post discharge.

Although it is unlikely the government will meet this target, restoration projects are still underway. One restoration strategy involves blocking peatland drainage canals, but the consequences of this for smallholder farmers whose livelihoods are dependent on agriculture are unclear. This paper investigates perceived impacts of canal blocks on smallholder farmers and identifies factors that affect their willingness to accept canal blocks on their land. We use data from 181 household questionnaires collected in 2018 across three villages in Jambi province, Sumatra. We found that the majority of respondents would accept canal blocks on their farms, perceiving that the blocks would have no impact on yields or farm access, and would decrease fire risk. Respondents who would not accept blocks on their farms were more likely to use canals to access their farms and perceive that canal blocks would decrease yields. The majority of farmers unwilling to accept canal blocks did not change their mind when provided with an option of a block that would allow boat travel. Our results improve understanding of why some smallholders may be unwilling to engage with peatland restoration. Further research is needed to understand the impact of canal blocks on smallholders’ yields. Engaging with stakeholders from the outset to understand farmers’ concerns, and perceptions is key if the government is to succeed in meeting its peatland restoration target and to ensure that the costs and benefits of restoration are evenly shared between local stakeholders and other actors.

In the IRONHEART study, we aimed to find out whether a modified in vitro clot lysis assay method, that includes the effect of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) might predict ICH outcomes. Patients and Methods: In this prospective, observational study, 89 consecutive non-traumatic ICH patients were enrolled. Exclusion criteria included aneurysm rupture, cancer, liver- or kidney failure or hemorrhagic diathesis. On admission, detailed clinical and laboratory investigations were performed. ICH volume was estimated based on CT performed on admission, day 14 and 90. A conventional in vitro clot lysis assay (CLA) and a modified CLA (mCLA) including cell-free-DNA and histones were performed from stored platelet-free plasma taken on admission. Clot formation and lysis in case of both assays were defined using the following variables calculated from the turbidimetric curves: maximum absorbance, time to maximum absorbance, clot lysis times (CLT) and area under the curve (CLA AUC). Long-term ICH outcomes were defined 90 days post-event by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). All patients or relatives provided written informed consent. Results: Patients with more severe stroke (NIHSS>10) presented significantly shorter clot lysis times of the mCLA in the presence of DNA and histone as compared to patients with milder stroke [10%CLT: NIHSS 0–10: median 31.5 (IQR: 21.0–40.0) min vs. NIHSS>10: 24 (18–31.0) min, p = 0.032]. Shorter clot lysis times of the mCLA showed significant association with non-survival by day 14 and with unfavorable long-term outcomes [mRS 0–1: 36.0 (22.5.0–51.0) min; mRS 2–5: 23.5 (18.0–36.0) min and mRS 6: 22.5 (18.0–30.5) min, p = 0.027]. Estimated ICH volume showed significant negative correlation with mCLA parameters, including 10%CLT (r = −0.3050, p = 0.009). ROC analysis proved good diagnostic performance of mCLA for predicting poor long-term outcomes [AUC: 0.73 (0.57–0.89)].

DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and PsycINFO were used to identify articles published between 1 January and 30 June 2021 assessing KAP regarding COVID-19 in the global general population. The quality of eligible studies was assessed. Random effects model was used to obtain the pooled proportion of each component of KAP of COVID-19. Heterogeneity (I(2)) was tested, and subgroup and correlation analyses were performed. RESULTS: Out of 3099 records, 84 studies from 45 countries across all continents assessing 215 731 participants’ COVID-19 KAP were included in this study. The estimated overall correct answers for knowledge, good attitude and good practice in this review were 75% (95% CI 72% to 77%), 74% (95% CI 71% to 77%) and 70% (95% CI 66% to 74%), respectively. Low-income countries, men, people aged below 30 years and people with 12 years of education or less had the lowest practice scores. Practice scores were below 60% in Africa and Europe/Oceania. Overall heterogeneity was high (I(2) ≥98%), and publication bias was present (Egger’s regression test, p<0.01). A positive significant correlation between knowledge and practice (r=0.314, p=0.006), and attitude and practice (r=0.348, p=0.004) was observed. CONCLUSIONS: This study’s findings call for community-based awareness programmes to provide a simple, clear and understandable message to reinforce knowledge especially regarding efficacy of the preventive measures in low and lower middle-income countries, and in Africa and Europe/Oceania, which will translate into good practice. Targeted intervention for men, people with low education, unemployed people and people aged below 30 years should be recommended. As most of the included studies were online surveys, underprivileged and remote rural people may have been missed out. Additional studies are needed to cover heterogeneous populations.

The immense damage done to public health and economies has prompted a global race for cures and vaccines. In developing a COVID-19 vaccine, we applied technology previously used for MERS-CoV to produce a prefusion-stabilized SARS-CoV-2 spike protein by adding two proline substitutions at the top of the central helix (S-2P). To enhance immunogenicity and mitigate the potential vaccine-induced immunopathology, CpG 1018, a Th1-biasing synthetic toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) agonist was selected as an adjuvant candidate. S-2P was combined with various adjuvants, including CpG 1018, and administered to mice to test its effectiveness in eliciting anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies. S-2P in combination with CpG 1018 and aluminum hydroxide (alum) was found to be the most potent immunogen and induced high titer of spike-specific antibodies in sera of immunized mice. The neutralizing abilities in pseudotyped lentivirus reporter or live wild-type SARS-CoV-2 were measured with reciprocal inhibiting dilution (ID50) titers of 5120 and 2560, respectively. In addition, the antibodies elicited were able to cross-neutralize pseudovirus containing the spike protein of the D614G variant, indicating the potential for broad spectrum protection. A marked Th-1 dominant response was noted from cytokines secreted by splenocytes of mice immunized with CpG 1018 and alum. No vaccine-related serious adverse effects were found in the dose-ranging study in rats administered single- or two-dose regimens with up to 50 μg of S-2P combined with CpG 1018 alone or CpG 1018 with alum. These data support continued development of CHO-derived S-2P formulated with CpG 1018/alum as a candidate vaccine to prevent COVID-19 disease.","Kuo, Tsun-Yung; Lin, Meei-Yun; Coffman, Robert L; Campbell, John D; Traquina, Paula; Lin, Yi-Jiun; Liu, Luke Tzu-Chi; Cheng, Jinyi; Wu, Yu-Chi; Wu, Chung-Chin; Tang, Wei-Hsuan; Huang, Chung-Guei; Tsao, Kuo-Chien; Shih, Shin-Ru; Chen, Charles",bioRxiv,79,11

In order to minimize the risk of potential COVID-19 transmission, many states instituted stay at home orders and closed churches, gyms, and other places that older adults often participate in social gatherings. Little is known about sleep health among older adults during this time. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between older adult’s personal factors, health behaviors, and sleep health during the initial months of the Covid-19 pandemic. METHODS: Adults age 60 and older participated in an online anonymous survey recruited through email lists of community senior organizations and university alumni using a snowball approach. Personal factors included age (years), gender (female=0, male=1), living situation (living alone=0, living with others=1), education (≤12 years = 0, >12 years = 1), and income (75000=1), and depressive symptoms (CESD-10). Health Behaviors included moderate physical activity (0=none, 1=yes), smoking (0=no, 1=yes), drinking (number of drinks). Sleep Health was assessed using the multidimensional SATED scale (Satisfaction, Alertness, Timing, Efficiency, and Duration). Backward stepwise regression analysis was used to test if personal factors and health behaviors significantly predicted participants’ sleep health. RESULTS: Participants included 509 adults (392 Females; mean age=75.6 years; SD=5.0; range 63–93 years). The majority were white (n=466; 92%) and 93% (n=471) had a college education. Seventy-four percent (n=71) participated in moderate exercise, 94% (n=478) did not smoke, and 58% (n=286) did not report drinking alcohol. Sleep Health was variable with 179 (36%) reporting poor sleep health (mean=7.4; SD=2.1). Regression results indicated that gender, years of education, living situation, income, depressive symptoms and moderate exercise explained 17% of the variance in sleep health (R2=0.169, F,6=14.4, p=0.000). CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that many older adults experienced poor sleep health associated with depressive symptoms and exercise participation during the initial months of the pandemic.

Rapid weight gain (RWG) in the first 6 months of infancy contributes to childhood obesity. Suboptimal sleep-wake patterns and gut microbiota (GM) have also been associated with childhood obesity, but little is known about their influences on early infant RWG. Sleep may alter the GM and infant metabolism, and ultimately impact obesity; however, data on the interaction between sleep-wake patterns and GM development on infant growth are scarce. In this study, we aim to investigate associations of infant sleep-wake patterns and GM development with RWG at 6 months and weight gain at 12 months. We also aim to evaluate whether temporal interactions exist between infant sleep-wake patterns and GM, and if these relations influence RWG. METHODS: The Snuggle Bug/ Acurrucadito study is an observational, longitudinal study investigating whether 24-h, actigraphy-assessed, sleep-wake patterns and GM development are associated with RWG among infants in their first year. Based on the Ecological Model of Growth, we propose a novel conceptual framework to incorporate sleep-wake patterns and the GM as metabolic contributors for RWG in the context of maternal-infant interactions, and familial and socio-physical environments. In total, 192 mother-infant pairs will be recruited, and sleep-wake patterns and GM development assessed at 3 and 8 weeks, and 3, 6, 9, and 12 months postpartum. Covariates including maternal and child characteristics, family and environmental factors, feeding practices and dietary intake of infants and mothers, and stool-derived metabolome and exfoliome data will be assessed. The study will apply machine learning techniques combined with logistic time-varying effect models to capture infant growth and aid in elucidating the dynamic associations between study variables and RWG. DISCUSSION: Repeated, valid, and objective assessment at clinically and developmentally meaningful intervals will provide robust measures of longitudinal sleep, GM, and growth. Project findings will provide evidence for future interventions to prevent RWG in infancy and subsequent obesity. The work also may spur the development of evidence-based guidelines to address modifiable factors that influence sleep-wake and GM development and prevent childhood obesity.","Petrov, Megan E.; Jiao, Nana; Panchanathan, Sarada S.; Reifsnider, Elizabeth; Coonrod, Dean V.; Liu, Li; Krajmalnik-Brown, Rosa; Gu, Haiwei; Davidson, Laurie A.; Chapkin, Robert S.; Whisner, Corrie M.",BMC Pediatr,79,16

Based on our previous studies demonstrating that over-expression of Activin-A in murine lung causes pathology sharing key features of COVID-19, we hypothesized that Activins and their natural inhibitor Follistatin might be particularly relevant to COVID-19 pathophysiology. METHODS: Activin-A, Activin-B and Follistatin levels were retrospectively analyzed in 574 serum samples from 263 COVID-19 patients hospitalized in three independent centers, and compared with common demographic, clinical and laboratory parameters. Optimal-scaling with ridge-regression was used to screen variables and establish a prediction model.

Information collected at a county level obscures local risk and complex interactions between clinical comorbidities, the built environment, population factors, and other social determinants of health. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop a COVID-19 community risk score that summarizes complex disease prevalence together with age and sex, and compares the score to different social determinants of health indicators and built environment measures derived from satellite images using deep learning. METHODS: We developed a robust COVID-19 community risk score (COVID-19 risk score) that summarizes the complex disease co-occurrences (using data for 2019) for individual census tracts with unsupervised learning, selected on the basis of their association with risk for COVID-19 complications such as death. We mapped the COVID-19 risk score to corresponding zip codes in New York City and associated the score with COVID-19–related death. We further modeled the variance of the COVID-19 risk score using satellite imagery and social determinants of health. RESULTS: Using 2019 chronic disease data, the COVID-19 risk score described 85% of the variation in the co-occurrence of 15 diseases and health behaviors that are risk factors for COVID-19 complications among ~28,000 census tract neighborhoods (median population size of tracts 4091). The COVID-19 risk score was associated with a 40% greater risk for COVID-19–related death across New York City (April and September 2020) for a 1 SD change in the score (risk ratio for 1 SD change in COVID-19 risk score 1.4; P<.001) at the zip code level. Satellite imagery coupled with social determinants of health explain nearly 90% of the variance in the COVID-19 risk score in the United States in census tracts (r(2)=0.87). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 risk score localizes risk at the census tract level and was able to predict COVID-19–related mortality in New York City. The built environment explained significant variations in the score, suggesting risk models could be enhanced with satellite imagery.","Deonarine, Andrew; Lyons, Genevieve; Lakhani, Chirag; De Brouwer, Walter",JMIR Public Health Surveill,79,24

Central to this approach is leadership support and health and safety climates that support day-to-day use of health and safety policies and programs. There is some research that supports these relationships, but there is limited research amongst small businesses. Furthermore, it remains to be shown what role TWH business strategies, as reflected by organizational policies and programs, play in this process. The purpose of this study is to characterize small businesses by their organizations’ TWH approach and assess the relationship of these approaches to employee health and safety behaviors. METHODS: We utilized cross-sectional data from 97 businesses participating in the Small+Safe+Well study. We collected data using a business assessment tool, Healthy Workplace Assessment™, and an employee assessment tool, Employee Health and Safety Culture Survey. We used latent profile analysis at the business level to identify subgroups of businesses based on a set of characteristics from these assessments. Linear regression analysis at the employee level was used to determine profile association with employee safety and health behaviors. RESULTS: There were two profiles characterized by the lowest (33% of all businesses) and highest (9%) levels of the indicators. There were also two profiles with higher scores on two of the different foci on either TWH business strategies (27%) or leadership and climate (31%). Employees working for a business with a profile that focused on leadership and climate, in addition to having a business strategy, reported the best safety and health behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that employee engagement in TWH will be highest when businesses have a strategy for how they implement a TWH approach and when they demonstrate leadership commitment to these strategies and foster positive safety and health climates. Our results offer suggestions on how to use TWH assessments to develop interventions for small businesses. More research is needed to understand whether small businesses can improve upon their profile overtime, whether these changes depend on contextual factors, and whether TWH interventions can help them improve their profile.

Most of the lung damage is driven by a surge in inflammatory cytokines [interleukin-6, interferon-γ, and granulocyte-monocyte stimulating factor (GM-CSF)]. Blunting this hyperinflammation with immunomodulation may lead to clinical improvement. GM-CSF is produced by many cells, including macrophages and T-cells. GM-CSF-derived signals are involved in differentiation of macrophages, including alveolar macrophages (AMs). In animal models of respiratory infections, the intranasal administration of GM-CSF increased the proliferation of AMs and improved outcomes. Increased levels of GM-CSF have been recently described in patients with COVID-19 compared to healthy controls. While GM-CSF might be beneficial in some circumstances as an appropriate response, in this case the inflammatory response is maladaptive by virtue of being later and disproportionate. The inhibition of GM-CSF signaling may be beneficial in improving the hyperinflammation-related lung damage in the most severe cases of COVID-19. This blockade can be achieved through antagonism of the GM-CSF receptor or the direct binding of circulating GM-CSF. Initial findings from patients with COVID-19 treated with a single intravenous dose of mavrilimumab, a monoclonal antibody binding GM-CSF receptor α, showed oxygenation improvement and shorter hospitalization. Prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled trials are ongoing. Anti-GM-CSF monoclonal antibodies, TJ003234 and gimsilumab, will be tested in clinical trials in patients with COVID-19, while lenzilumab received FDA approval for compassionate use. These trials will help inform whether blunting the inflammatory signaling provided by the GM-CSF axis in COVID-19 is beneficial.","Bonaventura, Aldo; Vecchié, Alessandra; Wang, Tisha S.; Lee, Elinor; Cremer, Paul C.; Carey, Brenna; Rajendram, Prabalini; Hudock, Kristin M.; Korbee, Leslie; Van Tassell, Benjamin W.; Dagna, Lorenzo; Abbate, Antonio",Front Immunol,79,11

Patients reported symptom burden, energy, and fatigue before and after each class. At baseline and post-intervention, symptom burden, quality of life, fatigue, physical activity, dietary intake, and physical function were assessed. Post-intervention interviews examined participant perspectives. RESULTS: The multimodal program was feasible, with 44% (10/23) recruitment, 75% (75/100) class attendance, 89% (8/9) nutrition and palliative consult attendance, and 85% (17/20) assessment completion. Of ten participants, 70% (7/10) completed the post-intervention follow-up. Participants perceived the intervention as feasible and valuable. Physical activity, symptom burden, and quality of life were maintained, while tiredness decreased significantly. Exercise classes prompted acute clinically meaningful reductions in fatigue, tiredness, depression, pain, and increases in energy and well-being. CONCLUSION: A multimodal physical activity, nutrition, and palliative symptom management intervention is feasible and shows potential benefits on quality of life that warrant further investigation in a larger cohort trial.

Methods: Test rooms, including a hospital single-patient room, were filled with test aerosol to simulate aerosol movement. Aerosol counts were measured over time with various portable air cleaning devices and room ventilation systems to quantify the aerosol concentration reduction rate and overall clearance rate. Results: Portable air cleaners were very effective in removing aerosols, especially for the devices with high flow rate. In a small control room, the aerosols were cleared 4 to 5 times faster with portable air cleaners than the room with HVAC alone. A single bed hospital room equipped with an excellent ventilation rate (~ 14 air changes per hour) can clear the aerosols in 20 minutes. However, with the addition of two air cleaners, the clearance time became 3 times faster (in 6 minutes and 30 seconds). Conclusions: Portable air cleaning devices with HEPA filtration were highly effective at removing aerosols. To clear aerosols (above 90% clearance) in under 10 minutes requires around 25 air changes per hour; readily feasible with air cleaners. Inexpensive portable air cleaning devices should be considered for small and enclosed spaces in health care settings such as inpatient rooms, personal protective equipment donning/doffing stations, and staff tea rooms. Portable air cleaners are particularly important where there is limited ability to reduce aerosol transmission with building HVAC ventilation.","Lee, J.; Rounds, M.; McGain, F.; Schofield, R.; Skidmore, G.; Wadlow, I.; Kevin, K.; Stevens, A.; Marshall, C.; Irving, L.; Kainer, M.; Buising, K.; Monty, J.",,79,20

However, little is known about the SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell immunity in virus-exposed individuals. Here we report virus-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell memory in recovered COVID-19 patients and close contacts. We also demonstrate the size and quality of the memory T-cell pool of COVID-19 patients are larger and better than those of close contacts. However, the proliferation capacity, size and quality of T-cell responses in close contacts are readily distinguishable from healthy donors, suggesting close contacts are able to gain T-cell immunity against SARS-CoV-2 despite lacking a detectable infection. Additionally, asymptomatic and symptomatic COVID-19 patients contain similar levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell memory. Overall, this study demonstrates the versatility and potential of memory T cells from COVID-19 patients and close contacts, which may be important for host protection.","Wang, Zhongfang; Yang, Xiaoyun; Zhong, Jiaying; Zhou, Yumin; Tang, Zhiqiang; Zhou, Haibo; He, Jun; Mei, Xinyue; Tang, Yonghong; Lin, Bijia; Chen, Zhenjun; McCluskey, James; Yang, Ji; Corbett, Alexandra J.; Ran, Pixin",Nat Commun,79,5

This may be intensified if digitisation gains additional support from investments in infrastructure or if the pandemic heralds a renaissance in the natural sciences — with a corresponding impact on human and physical capital as well as on technical knowledge. For the time being, it is unclear what effects the restructuring and secular structural change will have on potential output.

Such NPIs include social distancing, school closures, limiting international travel and complete lockdown. Worldwide the NPIs enforced to limit the spread of COVID-19 are now being lifted. Understanding how the risk increases when NPIs are lifted is important for decision making. Treating NPIs equally across countries and regions limits the possibility for modelling differences in epidemic response, as the response to the NPIs influences can vary between regions and this can affect the epidemic outcome, so do the strength and speed of lifting these. Our solution to this is to measure mobility changes from mobile phone data and their impacts on the basic reproductive number. We model the epidemic in all US states to compare the difference in outcome if NPIs are lifted or retained. We show that keeping NPIs just a few weeks longer has a substantial impact on the epidemic outcome.","Bryant, P.; Elofsson, A.",,79,16

Early reports that the SARS-CoV-2 virus was detectable in wastewater in advance of confirmed cases sparked widespread interest in wastewater based epidemiology (WBE) as a tool for mitigation of COVID-19 outbreaks. One hypothesis was that wastewater surveillance might provide a cost-effective alternative to other more expensive approaches such as pooled and random testing of groups. In this paper, we report the outcomes of a wastewater surveillance pilot program at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, a large urban university with a substantial population of students living in on-campus dormitories. Surveillance was conducted at the building level on a thrice-weekly schedule throughout the university's fall residential semester. In multiple cases, wastewater surveillance enabled identification of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases that were not detected by other components of the campus monitoring program, which also included in-house contact tracing, symptomatic testing, scheduled testing of student athletes, and daily symptom reporting. In the context of all cluster events reported to the University community during the fall semester, wastewater-based testing events resulted in identification of smaller clusters than events triggered by other means. This includes identification of single asymptomatic individuals in dorms with total resident populations of 150-200. While the strategy described was developed for COVID-19, it is likely to be broadly applicable to mitigation of future pandemics in universities and other group-living environments.","Gibas, C.

This study answers this question using a novel survey experiment and finds that emphasis on the unequal aspect of the pandemic, especially as it relates to the elderly and those with medical conditions, could be causing the public to become less concerned about the outbreak and its human toll. Discussion situates this finding in the literature on scientific communication and persuasion and explains why language that emphasizes the impact of the virus on all of us—rather than singling out certain groups—could be more effective in increasing caution among the general public and make them take the situation more seriously.","Yildirim, Ugur",PLoS One,79,1

The second aim was to audit whether safeguarding assessments were carried out for those accessing the service remotely. METHODS: April-September 2020 consultation numbers for teenagers aged 17 years and under were compared with the 2019 equivalent. Service safeguarding assessment standards were reviewed for teenagers receiving telephone consultations for the first 6 months of lockdown, April-September 2020. RESULTS: There was a reduction in contact with the service of 100% for those aged 13 years and younger, 52% for those aged 14 and 15 years and 31% for those aged 16 and 17 years for the compared months. A safeguarding assessment was either carried out by the service or accounted for by a partner community practitioner for all contacts with the service by young people 15 years or younger. 96% of safeguarding assessments were carried out for those aged 16-17 years. CONCLUSIONS: There was a reduction in consultations for all age groups examined in the 6 months following lockdown. This adds to the evidence that restrictions during lockdown are barriers to young people accessing SHSs. For those who did have a consultation, safeguarding assessments were consistently carried out. Nevertheless, due to reduced contact overall, it is likely that some safeguarding issues remain undisclosed. Multiagency safeguarding networks and telephone consultations with a low threshold for promoting an in-person consultation facilitated access to the SHS and a robust safeguarding pathway during the constraints of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Bekaert, Sarah; Azzopardi, Liz",Sex. transm. infect,79,1

The adaptive immune response seems to play a major role in the progression of the disease, since entry of SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) is determined by a spike protein recognized by T helper cells. This has been linked to the clinical finding of severe lymphocytopenia in these patients. However, detailed cellular immune responses in the bone marrow (BM) and in the spleen (SPL) of COVID-19 patients have not been addressed yet. Here, we provide novel immunologic insight with potential for therapeutic management and risk stratification in COVID-19. Material and Methods: We performed complete autopsies on 11 confirmed COVID-19 and 4 non-COVID-19 deceased, who were matched for risk profile and age. SARS-CoV-2 load was measured by rt-PCR (quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction) targeting the SARS-CoV-2 E-gene in purified RNA extracts from 50mg of pulmonary tissue (MagNAPure 96 system, Viral NA Large Volume Kit, Roche). For histopathology, representative tissue samples of decalcified BM and SPL were fixed in 4 % buffered formalin, dehydrated and paraffin embedded. Sections were stained with HE, PAS, Giemsa-, Gomori- and Prussian blue stain. Furthermore, BM and SPL were stained with immunohistochemical reagents, namely MPO (Myeloperoxidase), CD235, CD34, CD117, CD68, CD61, CD20, CD3, CD4, CD8, CD138, HLA-DR (Human Leucocyte antigen - DR isotype), PD-1, PD-L1 (Programmed cell death protein and ligand 1), Ki67 and Caspase3 (Ventana Ultra and LEICA Bond III). Additionally, we performed in-situ hybridization of EBV (Epstein-Barr-Virus; LEICA Bond MAX), followed by PCR of the EBV nuclear antigen 1 (Thermo Fisher and Roche). Histopathology was evaluated by at least two hematopathologists. Clinical data were obtained from patients' files. Statistical analysis was done using GraphPad Prism8 Software. Inc, 2018. Results: Of all COVID-19 deceased, 73% (n = 8/11) showed BM hypercellularity, increased granulocyte / erythrocyte ratios, and left shift of erythro- and granulopoiesis with anemia and an increase of immature granulocytes in the peripheral blood. Thromboembolic events were present in 82% (n = 9/11) of COVID-19 patients and related to an increase and left shift of megakaryopoiesis in the BM. In the BM of patients with severe bacterial superinfection of COVID-19 pneumonia, we observed an early increase of PD-L1 expression on myeloid cells, lymphocytic apoptosis, and time-dependent macrophage anergy with a continuous loss of antigen-presenting capacity. Furthermore, we found CD20+ B-cell depletion in either BM or SPL in 64% (n = 7/11) of COVID-19 patients with B-cell counts of less than 1% in the BM and 1-5% in the SPL, followed by complete plasma cell depletion. This was reflected by severe lymphocytopenia in the peripheral blood. In contrast, BM T-cell counts were nearly as high in COVID-19 decedents (median 10%) as in cases not related to COVID-19 (median 12.5%). Interestingly, there was a tendency towards higher pulmonary SARS-CoV-2 RNA load in COVID-19 patients with B-cell depletion, as we observed maximum viral copy numbers of up to 1,150,000 / 10,000 cells in patients with B-cell depletion as compared to 6,500 / 10,000 cells in patients with B-cell preservation. EBV was absent in all cases. Clinical characteristics and time-intervals between initial symptoms and death of COVID-19 patients were heterogenous, therefore preventing the detection of a clinical risk profile in patients with B-cell depletion. Conclusion: Our results show that severe lymphocyte depletion in COVID-19 deceased is caused by a substantial loss of B-cells which is in turn associated with viral SARS-CoV-2 burden and presumably results from excessive activation of the adaptive immune system. It is yet to be determined how B-cell specific pathways are affected by SARS-CoV-2 and whether this might serve as a therapeutic target of interest. Moreover, we provide morphologic evidence, that COVID-19 pneumonia with bacterial superinfection is aggravated by sepsis acquired immunodeficiency. Since the latter is associated with an epigenetically determined switch to endotoxin tolerance, our findings may additionally aid in risk stratification of COVID-19 patients who undergo severe bacterial superinfection during the disease.

COVID‐19 illustrates that the biomaterials community was engaged in significant research efforts against bacteria and fungi with relatively little effort devoted to viruses. Accordingly, biomaterials scientists and engineers will have to participate in multidisciplinary antiviral research over the coming years. Although tissue engineering and regenerative medicine have historically dominated the field of biomaterials, current research holds promise for providing transformative solutions to viral outbreaks. To facilitate collaboration, it is imperative to establish a mutual language and adequate understanding between clinicians, industry partners, and research scientists.

Here we analyzed the genomes of SARS-CoV-2 and other single-strand RNA (ssRNA) viruses for the presence of a unique cis RNA element called SECReTE. This motif consists of 10 or more consecutive triplet nucleotide repeats where a pyrimidine nucleotide (C or U) in present every third base, and which we identified in mRNAs encoding secreted proteins in bacteria, yeast, and humans. This motif facilitates mRNA localization to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), along with the enhanced translation and secretion of translated protein. We now examined for SECReTE presence in Group IV and V RNA viruses, the former including the Coronaviridae, like SARS-CoV-2 and other positive (+)ssRNA viruses, and the latter consisting of negative (-) ssRNA viruses. Interestingly, the SARS-CoV-2 genome contains 40 SECReTE motifs at an abundance of ~1.3 SECReTEs/kilobase (kb). Moreover, all ssRNA viruses we examined contain multiple copies of this motif and appears in (+)ssRNA viruses as non-random in occurrence and independent of genome length. Importantly, (+)ssRNA viruses (e.g. Coronaviruses and Hepaciviruses), which utilize ER membranes to create double membrane vesicles to serve as viral replication centers (VRCs), contain more SECReTE motifs per kb as compared to (−)ssRNA viruses (e.g. Rabies, Mumps, and Influenza), that replicate in the nucleus or the cytoplasm, or other (+)ssRNA viruses (e.g. Enteroviruses and Flaviviruses) which employ different organellar membranes. As predicted by our earlier work, SECReTE sequences are mostly found in membranal or ER-associated/secreted proteins. Thus, we propose that SECReTE motifs could be important for the efficient translation and secretion of secreted viral proteins, as well as for VRC formation. Future studies of SECReTE function and identification of SECReTE-binding proteins could provide new drug targets to treat COVID-19 and other (+)ssRNA related diseases.","Haimovich, Gal; Olender, Tsviya; Baez, Camila; Gerst, Jeffrey E.",bioRxiv,79,1

Methods: Data were retrospective collected from adults hospitalized with COVID-19 in Wuhan Union Hospital. We described the clinical features and SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding of patients with COVID-19 and evaluated factors associated with prolonged virus shedding by multivariate regression analysis. Results: Among 238 patients, the median age was 55.5 years, 57.1% were female, 92.9% (221/238) used arbidol, 58.4% (139/238) used arbidol combination with interferon. The median time from illness onset to start arbidol was 8 days (IQR, 5-14 days) and the median duration of SARS-CoV-2 virus shedding was 23 days (IQR, 17.8-30 days). SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance was significantly delayed in patients who received arbidol >7 days after illness onset, compared with those in whom arbidol treatment was started less than or equal to7 days after illness onset (HR, 1.738 [95% CI, 1.339-2.257], P < .001). Multivariate regression analysis revealed that prolonged viral shedding was significantly associated with initiation arbidol more than seven days after symptom onset (OR 2.078, 95% CI [1.114-3.876], P .004), more than 7 days from onset of symptoms to first medical visitation (OR 3.321, 95% CI[1.559-7.073], P .002), illness onset before Jan.31, 2020 (OR 3.223, 95% CI[1.450-7.163], P .021).

Several widely available drugs like statins, ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have immunometabolic activities that (among other things) maintain or restore endothelial cell function. For this reason, we undertook an observational study in four Belgian hospitals to determine whether in-hospital treatment with these drugs could improve survival in 959 COVID-19 patients. We found that treatment with statins and ACEIs/ARBs reduced 28-day mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Moreover, combination treatment with these drugs resulted in a 3-fold reduction in the odds of hospital mortality (OR = 0.33; 95% CI 0.17–0.69).

In search of a tool to spread dermatologic knowledge during confinement, an online medical meeting was held on April 25th to 26th, 2020. In this study, we aimed to assess the characteristics, opinion and satisfaction of the attendees to a free-of-charge online congress. Secondarily, we intended to explain how this meeting was prepared. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Online survey administered to the attendees to an online congress organised via the Telegram® Messenger App. Its organisation and planning, which needed no financial support and was done by volunteer organisers, moderators and speakers, is described step by step. RESULTS: The satisfaction of both speakers and attendees was very high. All participants considered that this format had a great present and future, and most of them rated it as superior to regular face-to-face meetings. Female gender and predominantly private practice favoured this opinion. DISCUSSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has forced the cancellation of most scientific gatherings. This has been seen by some authors as an excellent opportunity, encouraging medical societies and organisations to lead the change to virtual meetings. Although confinement did not allow real contact, our online meeting showed it was possible to ensure interaction and participation between attendees, moderators and speakers. Dermatologists enjoyed some dermatologic science, even despite the extraordinary circumstances disrupting their daily clinical practice. Most of them felt they were participating in something new and compelling that many felt superior to traditional meetings.","Martin-Gorgojo, A.; Bernabeu-Wittel, J.; Linares-Barrios, M.; Russo-de la Torre, F.; Garcia-Doval, I.; del Rio-de la Torre, E.",Actas Dermosifiliogr,79,9

This call for action argues for the need to define resilience as a person-centered multi-dimensional metric, informed by a dynamic lifespan perspective and combining observational and interventional experimental studies to identify specific neural markers and correlated behavioral measures. The COVID-19 pandemic highlights the urgent need of such an effort with the ultimate goal of defining a new vital sign, an individual index of resilience, as a life-long metric with the capacity to predict an individual's risk for disability in the face of a stressor, insult, injury or disease.

Malnutrition, in all its forms, may negatively impact the susceptibility and severity of SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2) infection in both children and older adults. Both undernutrition and obesity have been evoked as conditions associated with a higher susceptibility to the infection and poor prognosis. In turn, the COVID-19 infection may worsen the nutritional status through highly catabolic conditions, exposing individuals to the risk of malnutrition, muscle wasting, and nutritional deficiencies. Accordingly, the relationship between malnutrition and COVID-19 is likely to be bidirectional. Furthermore, the modification of nutritional behaviors and physical activity, required to limit the spread of the virus, are posing a challenge to health at both the extremes of life. Thus far, even the most advanced healthcare systems have failed to address the alarming consequences of malnutrition posed by this pandemic. If not properly addressed, we may run the risk that new and old generations will experience the consequences of COVID-19 related malnutrition.","Spolidoro, Giulia C.

Sixteen naturally infected FIV/FeLV cats were followed during rFeIFNω therapy in order to monitor clinical signs and to correlate with excretion of concomitant viruses (FCV, FHV-1, feline coronavirus (FCoV) and parvovirus (FPV)). Cats were submitted to clinical evaluations and concomitant virus excretion assessement. Comparing D0–D65, 10/16 cats improved clinical scores. Of the 10 cats positive for FHV-1 on D0, 4 were negative and 6 reduced viral loads. Of the 11 FCoV positive cats, 9 reduced viral loads. The 13 FCV positive cats and the FPV positive cat were negative on D65. In conclusion, rFeIFNω improves clinical signs and reduces concurrent viral excretion in naturally infected retroviral cats.","Gil, Solange; Leal, Rodolfo O.; Duarte, Ana; McGahie, David; Sepúlveda, Nuno; Siborro, Inês; Cravo, Joana; Cartaxeiro, Clara; Tavares, Luís M.",Res Vet Sci,79,24

Viral infections are unique in that they recruit human cellular machinery to replicate themselves and spread infection. The number of viruses causing human disease is vast, and viruses can be broadly categorized by their structures. Many viruses, such as influenza, appear to be amorphous particles, whereas others, such as herpes simplex virus, rhinovirus, dengue virus, and adenovirus, have roughly symmetric structural components. Icosahedral viruses have been a target of electron microscopists for years, and they were some of the first objects to be reconstructed three-dimensionally from electron micrographs. The ease with which highly purified and conformationally uniform virus samples can be produced makes them an ideal target structural studies. Apart from their biological significance, these virus samples have played a pivotal role in the development of new methodologies in the field of molecular biology as well as in cryo-electron microscopy and cryo-electron tomography.","Rochat, R.H.; Chiu, W.",Comprehensive Biophysics,79,24

In today’s world that demands more security and a touchless unique identification system, face aging attains tremendous attention. The existing face age progression approaches have the key problem of unnatural modifications of facial attributes due to insufficient prior knowledge of input images and nearly visual artifacts in the generated output. Research has been continuing in face aging to handle the challenge to generate aged faces accurately. So, to solve the issue, the proposed work focuses on the realistic face aging method using AttentionGAN and SRGAN. AttentionGAN uses two separate subnets in a generator. One subnet for generating multiple attention masks and the other for generating multiple content masks. Then attention mask is multiplied with the corresponding content mask along with an input image to finally achieve the desired results. Further, the regex filtering process is performed to separates the synthesized face images from the output of AttentionGAN. Then image sharpening with edge enhancement is done to give high-quality input to SRGAN, which further generates the super-resolution face aged images. Thus, presents more detailed information in an image because of its high quality. Moreover, the experimental results are obtained from five publicly available datasets: UTKFace, CACD, FGNET, IMDB-WIKI, and CelebA. The proposed work is evaluated with quantitative and qualitative methods, produces synthesized face aged images with a 0.001% error rate, and is also evaluated with the comparison to prior methods. The paper focuses on the various practical applications of super-resolution face aging using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).","Sharma, Neha; Sharma, Reecha; Jindal, Neeru",Multimed Tools Appl,79,16

Prolonged asymptomatic respiratory viral shedding in children has been described and may be another important reservoir for ongoing transmission. The primary diagnostic approach to identify SARS-CoV2 infection relies on qPCR of specific viral sequences from respiratory samples, which is expensive, uncomfortable, relatively slow, and susceptible to false-negative results. A rapid non-invasive method to detect mild or asymptomatic infection would have a major impact on public health campaigns to control COVID-19. We hypothesize that candidate biomarkers characterize the exhaled breath of children with SARS-CoV2 infection. To test this hypothesis, we enrolled SARS-CoV-2-infected and -uninfected children admitted to a major pediatric academic medical center and analyzed their breath volatile composition. Targeted volatiles analysis revealed that six volatile organic compounds increased significantly in SARS-CoV-2-infected children. Three aldehydes (octanal, nonanal, and heptanal) drew special attention as candidate biomarkers, because viral infections have previously been shown to induce aldehyde production. Together, these biomarkers demonstrated 100% sensitivity and 66.6% specificity. Our work provides a solid framework upon which to build a future “breathalyzer” test for SARS-CoV-2 infection in children.","Berna, Amalia Z.; Akaho, Elikplim H.; Harris, Rebecca M.; Congdon, Morgan; Korn, Emilie; Neher, Samuel; M’Farrej, Mirna; Burns, Julianne; John, Audrey R.

In this preclinical study, we investigated whether the combination of HCQ+AZI would be compatible with the therapeutic induction of anticancer immune responses. For this, we used doses of HCQ and AZI that affect whole-body physiology (as indicated by a partial blockade in cardiac and hepatic autophagic flux for HCQ and a reduction in body weight for AZI), showing that their combined administration did not interfere with tumor growth control induced by the immunogenic cell death inducer oxaliplatin. Moreover, the HCQ+AZI combination did not affect the capacity of a curative regimen (cisplatin + crizotinib + PD-1 blockade) to eradicate established orthotopic lung cancers in mice. In conclusion, it appears that HCQ+AZI does not interfere with the therapeutic induction of therapeutic anticancer immune responses.","Liu, Peng; Zhao, Liwei; Ferrere, Gladys; Alves-Costa-Silva, Carolina; Ly, Pierre; Wu, Qi; Tian, Ai-Ling; Derosa, Lisa; Zitvogel, Laurence; Kepp, Oliver; Kroemer, Guido",Oncoimmunology,79,16

Here we show that the complement system is unexpectedly one of the intracellular pathways most highly induced by SARS-CoV2 infection in lung epithelial and liver cells. Within cells of the bronchoalveolar lavage of patients, distinct signatures of complement activation in myeloid, lymphoid and epithelial cells tracked with disease severity. Modelling the regulome of host genes induced by COVID-19 and the drugs that could normalize these genes both implicated the JAK1/2-STAT1 signaling system downstream of type I interferon receptors, and NF-kB. Ruxolitinib, a JAK1/2 inhibitor and the top predicted pharmaceutical candidate, normalized interferon signature genes, IL-6 (the best characterized severity marker in COVID-19) and all complement genes induced by SARS-CoV2, but did not affect NF-kB-regulated genes.

The aim of the study was to identify relative risk factors and co-infections concerning the seropositive HEV IgG among blood donors and haemodialysis (HD) patients in the central blood bank and renal dialysis centre in Wad Medani city, Gezira State, Sudan. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study that included 600 participants, among them 180 showed strong seropositive HEV IgG. The structured questionnaire was used to collect data of the participants’ demographics, disease risk factors and HEV IgG co-infections with HBV, HCV, HIV and syphilis. RESULTS: Among the 180 strong seropositive HEV IgG respondents, 84 were blood donors and 96 were haemodialysis patients. The gender and age (18–30 years) had a significant association with the virus exposure (P = 0.000, P = 0.000). Importantly, a significant association of HEV prevalence due to the localities effect exhibited with the highest rate among South Gezira (OR = 38, CI = 14.1–107; P = 0.000). This also observed in Wad Medani, Umm Algura, East Gezira and Managil localities (P = 0.000). The effect of the animal contact on HEV distribution exerted the significant association among the respondents for blood donors and haemodialysis patients in univariate (OR = 4.09, 95% CI 1.5–10.9; P = 0.005) and multivariate (OR = 3.2, CI = 1.1–9.4; P = 0.027) analysis. CONCLUSION: The relative risk factors of the HEV seroprevalence were gender, age, locality and animal contact. Besides the need of a regular survey for the virus seroprevalence, primary health care physicians can play pivotal role in health education, especially in rural areas of Sudan. In addition, primary health care physicians in Sudan are expected to establish strategies and plans to eradicate and minimise the health impact of HEV.","Babiker, Nassir A.; Abakar, Adam D.; Mohamed, Nawal T.; Abuzeid, Nadir; Modawe, GadAllah; Iesa, Mohamed A.; Assil, Sami; Osman, Hisham; Hamed, Mohamed; Ahmed, Mohamed H.",J Family Med Prim Care,79,21
