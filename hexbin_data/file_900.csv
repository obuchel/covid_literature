Cathelicidin-related antimicrobial peptide (CRAMP), the mouse analog of LL-37 peptide in humans, is a cationic antimicrobial peptide belonging to the cathelicidin family; however, its secretion by cancer cells and role in the tumor microenvironment (TME) remain unclear. In this study, we explored the possibility of an interaction between effector CD4+ T cells and CRAMP using in vitro-generated mouse Th17 cells. We found that CRAMP stimulates Th17 cells to express the ectonucleotidase CD73, while simultaneously inducing cell death. This finding suggested that CD73-expressing Th17 cells may function as immune suppressor cells instead of effector cells. In addition, treatment of pharmacological inhibitors of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) signaling pathway showed that induction of CD73 expression is mediated by the p38 signaling pathway. Overall, our findings suggest that tumor-derived LL-37 likely functions as an immune suppressor that induces immune tolerance against tumors through shaping effector Th17 cells into suppressor Th17 cells, suggesting a new intervention target to improve cancer immunotherapy.","Lee, Jeonghyun; Shin, Kyong-Oh; Kim, Yesol; Cho, Jaewon; Lim, Hyung W; Yoon, Sung-Il; Lee, Geun-Shik; Ko, Hyun-Jeong; Kim, Pyeung-Hyeun; Uchida, Yoshikazu; Park, Kyungho; Kang, Seung Goo",Cells,900,24

Our gAIRR Suite comprises three modules. gAIRR-seq, a probe capture-based targeted sequencing pipeline, profiles AIRR from individual DNA samples. gAIRR-call and gAIRR-annotate call alleles from gAIRR-seq reads and annotate whole-genome assemblies respectively. We gAIRR-seqed TRV and TRJ of seven Genome in a Bottle (GIAB) DNA samples with 100% accuracy, and discovered novel alleles. We gAIRR-annotated 36 genomes to cumulatively unearth 325 novel TRV alleles and 29 novel TRJ alleles. We could further profile the flanking sequences, including the recombination signal sequence (RSS). We validated two structural variants for HG002. We uncovered substantial conflicts of AIRR genes in references GRCh37 and GRCh38. The gAIRR Suite can potentially benefit future genetic study and clinical applications of various immune-related phenotypes.","Lin, Mao-Jan; Lin, Yu-Chun; Chen, Nae-Chyun; Luo, Allen Chilun; Lai, Sheng-Kai; Hsu, Chia-Lang; Hsu, Jacob Shujui; Chen, Chien-Yu; Yang, Wei-Shiung; Chen, Pei-Lung",bioRxiv,900,16

It is intriguing what impact it will have on Kosovo as a country with the lowest suicide rate in Europe.ObjectivesThe objective of this study was to understand the level of suicidal thinking as a result of the COVID-19 situation and possible associations with sociodemographic variables.MethodsIt’s a comparative study. We examined data of two cross-sectional online surveys conducted during the one-month periods 20.03.20 until 23.04.20 and 27.04.2020 until 05.06.2020. The participants were online respondents, N = 194 (first period) and N = 155 (second period);who completed the Albanian version of PHQ-9. We used the statement number 9 of questionnaire indicative of suicide.ResultsMean score of suicidal thinking resulted 0.58 (SD = .98) in the first period and 0.84 (SD = 1.16) in the second period. 10.1% of participants in March/April and 18.2% in May/June period scored that almost every day thoughts that would be better off dead, or of hurting yourself in some way. Significantly higher suicidal thinking resulted for females and for respondents who had previously had depression in both periods. Compared to two previous studies (2018 and 2019) in different settings only the results of the second period show an increase in suicidal thinking.ConclusionsFurther studies are needed to better scientifically elaborate these findings. It is important enhanced surveillance of COVID-19-related risk factors contributing to suicidal behaviors and timely preventive efforts.DisclosureNo significant relationships.","Fanaj, N.; Mustafa, S.; Ajradini, A.; Kabashaj, B.; Poniku, I.",European Psychiatry,900,16

However, despite the development and use of many models and sophisticated tools, these forecasting attempts have largely failed. We present a model that considers the severity of the disease and the heterogeneity of contacts between the population in complex space–time dynamics. Using mathematical and computational methods, the applied tool was developed to analyze and manage the COVID-19 pandemic (from an epidemiological point of view), with a particular focus on population heterogeneity in terms of age, susceptibility, and symptom severity. We show improved strategies to prevent an epidemic outbreak. We evaluated the model in three countries, obtaining an average mean square error of 0.067 over a full month of the basic reproduction number (R0). The goal of this study is to create a theoretical framework for crisis management that integrates accumulated epidemiological considerations. An applied result is an open-source program for predicting the outcome of an isolation strategy for future researchers and developers who can use and extend our model.

Data collected included demographics National Confidential Enquiry into Patient Outcome and Death (NCEPOD) category and procedure. The primary outcome was 90-day post-operative mortality;secondary outcomes included time to intervention and length of inpatient stay Result: 132 patients (2020) versus 141 (2019) patients were included with no significant difference in age (P=0.676), sex (P=0.230), or overall 90-day postoperative mortality (P=0.196). Notably, time to intervention was faster for NCEPOD code 3 patients in 2020 than 2019 (P=0.027) Time to intervention in 2020 was longer for those dying within 90 days post-operatively compared to survivors (P=0.02). There was no difference in length of stay between years, both overall and when comparing subgroups by NCEPOD category or procedures (fractured neck of femur (P=0.776), laparoscopies (P=0.866), laparotomies (P=0.252)), except for upper limb trauma (P=0.007) Conclusion: This study is amongst the first describing the general case mix in emergency theatres in the UK. Patient pre-operative characteristics and demographics did not change. Our data confirms patient prioritisation according to NCEPOD recommendations and streamlining of surgical services, with no difference in overall mortality time to intervention or length of stay compared to 2019 Take-home Message: At this district general hospital, patients were appropriately prioritised, and our results show adaptation of hospital practice to emerging national guidelines during the first phase of lockdown A national validation audit assessing morbidity and mortality outcomes for all NCEPOD patients may be facilitate further understanding of risks posed to patients requiring urgent surgery during these unprecedented times .","Luo, W.; Limb, R.; Aslam, A.; Kattimani, R.; Karthikappallil, D.; Paramasivan, A.; Waseem, M.",British Journal of Surgery,900,5

The Mental Health Checklist (MHCL) is a measure developed to assess psychological health during extended periods of isolation and confinement, and has shown strong psychometric properties in community samples and during Antarctic missions. This study validated the MHCL in a sample of 359 U.S. and U.K adults during the peak of the COVID-19 lockdown. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) tested model fit, and convergent validity analyses were conducted to compare the MHCL with validated measures of depression, anxiety and stress, as well as insomnia. The MHCL exhibited good model fit for most CFA indices, and showed strong convergent validity with other measures of psychological well-being. Findings suggest that the MHCL is useful for assessing mental health in a variety of environments and conditions.","So, Christine J; Kim, Jinu; Cifre, Anthony B; Gonzalez, Rogelio D; Bower, Joanne L; Alfano, Candice A",,900,16

The aim of this study is to evaluate the influence of patient-related and surgery-related variables in a consecutive group of patients that underwent TKA. Individuals (n = 648) who had TKA performed between 01 January 2013 and 31 December 2017 were enrolled in the study. Postoperative Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) score, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) and Forgotten Joint score (FJS-12) were collected at a mean follow-up of 4.79 years. Patient satisfaction was assessed with a questionnaire. Determinants of satisfaction (age, sex, smoking, presence of diabetes or cardiovascular disease, pain in other joints, preoperative arthritic stage) and components of satisfaction (slope variation, mechanical axis variation, outlier final alignment, surgeon experience) were examined to identify which variables correlated with positive outcome. Correlations with septic and mechanicals failures were also evaluated. Thirteen percent of patients were unsatisfied, despite good results in KOOS, WOMAC and FJS-12 tests. Female gender, low Kellgren–Lawrence grade and the presence of back pain and pain in other joints were factors associated with poor clinical results. Poorer clinical results were also reported in younger patients. Infection rate was correlated with active smoking and mechanical failure with an outlier final alignment. Comorbidities, smoking habits and high expectations have a big influence on TKA results and on final satisfaction after surgery.","Rissolio, Lorenzo; Sabatini, Luigi; Risitano, Salvatore; Bistolfi, Alessandro; Galluzzo, Umberto; Massè, Alessandro; Indelli, Pier Francesco",J Clin Med,900,16
