3,3,3,Role of endothelin-1 in lung disease,13.8296175,8.12358,2001-02-22,"Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a 21 amino acid peptide with diverse biological activity that has been implicated in numerous diseases. ET-1 is a potent mitogen regulator of smooth muscle tone, and inflammatory mediator that may play a key role in diseases of the airways, pulmonary circulation, and inflammatory lung diseases, both acute and chronic. This review will focus on the biology of ET-1 and its role in lung disease.","Fagan, Karen A; McMurtry, Ivan F; Rodman, David M",Respir Res,3,17
211,211,211,A Novel Peptide Enhances Therapeutic Efficacy of Liposomal Anti-Cancer Drugs in Mice Models of Human Lung Cancer,14.034429,8.0242195,2009-01-12,"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. The lack of tumor specificity remains a major drawback for effective chemotherapies and results in dose-limiting toxicities. However, a ligand-mediated drug delivery system should be able to render chemotherapy more specific to tumor cells and less toxic to normal tissues. In this study, we isolated a novel peptide ligand from a phage-displayed peptide library that bound to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines. The targeting phage bound to several NSCLC cell lines but not to normal cells. Both the targeting phage and the synthetic peptide recognized the surgical specimens of NSCLC with a positive rate of 75% (27 of 36 specimens). In severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice bearing NSCLC xenografts, the targeting phage specifically bound to tumor masses. The tumor homing ability of the targeting phage was inhibited by the cognate synthetic peptide, but not by a control or a WTY-mutated peptide. When the targeting peptide was coupled to liposomes carrying doxorubicin or vinorelbine, the therapeutic index of the chemotherapeutic agents and the survival rates of mice with human lung cancer xenografts markedly increased. Furthermore, the targeting liposomes increased drug accumulation in tumor tissues by 5.7-fold compared with free drugs and enhanced cancer cell apoptosis resulting from a higher concentration of bioavailable doxorubicin. The current study suggests that this tumor-specific peptide may be used to create chemotherapies specifically targeting tumor cells in the treatment of NSCLC and to design targeted gene transfer vectors or it may be used one in the diagnosis of this malignancy.","Chang, De-Kuan; Lin, Chin-Tarng; Wu, Chien-Hsun; Wu, Han-Chung",PLoS One,3,11
258,258,258,Is the risk of multiple sclerosis related to the ‘biography’ of the immune system?,13.919604,7.9661837,2009-03-01,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) with onset in childhood offers a unique opportunity to study the infectious background of this disease but the immune reactions against infectious agents in such children have only recently been investigated. These and other epidemiological studies strongly implicate involvement of one or more infectious agents in the aetiology of MS, with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) being the prime candidate. Rather than being the actual cause of MS, it is more probable that these agents are involved in the development of immunoregulatory pathways. These pathways, if disturbed by hygiene-related factors including an altered sequence of infections, may generate and maintain a deficit within the immunological network that facilitates, to particular early events in the development of MS, preceding the onset of MS disease by years or a decade. A framework that can serve as a guide for further epidemiological, immunologic and molecular biologic investigations is formulated. This approach may shed light on the complex natural history of MS and may lead to rational preventive and therapeutic strategies. It is possible that, in the future, MS could be prevented by vaccination against EBV in early childhood; the framework is of relevance to the design of an appropriate type of vaccine.","Krone, Bernd; Oeffner, Frank; Grange, John M.",J Neurol,3,1
478,478,478,Therapeutic Vaccination in Chronic Hepatitis B: Preclinical Studies in the Woodchuck,14.256946,8.124094,2010-09-07,"Recommended treatment of chronic hepatitis B with interferon-α and/or nucleos(t)ide analogues does not lead to a satisfactory result. Induction of HBV-specific T cells by therapeutic vaccination or immunotherapies may be an innovative strategy to overcome virus persistence. Vaccination with commercially available HBV vaccines in patients did not result in effective control of HBV infection, suggesting that new formulations of therapeutic vaccines are needed. The woodchuck (Marmota monax) is a useful preclinical model for developing the new therapeutic approaches in chronic hepadnaviral infections. Several innovative approaches combining antiviral treatments with nucleos(t)ide analogues, DNA vaccines, and protein vaccines were tested in the woodchuck model. In this paper we summarize the available data concerning therapeutic immunization and gene therapy using recombinant viral vectors approaches in woodchucks, which show encouraging results. In addition, we present potential innovations in immunomodulatory strategies to be evaluated in this animal model.","Kosinska, Anna D.; Zhang, Ejuan; Lu, Mengji; Roggendorf, Michael",Hepat Res Treat,3,1
583,583,583,Claudins in lung diseases,13.734447,7.9511547,2011-05-27,"Tight junctions are the most apically localized part of the epithelial junctional complex. They regulate the permeability and polarity of cell layers and create compartments in cell membranes. Claudins are structural molecules of tight junctions. There are 27 claudins known, and expression of different claudins is responsible for changes in the electrolyte and solute permeability in cells layers. Studies have shown that claudins and tight junctions also protect multicellular organisms from infections and that some infectious agents may use claudins as targets to invade and weaken the host's defense. In neoplastic diseases, claudin expression may be up- or downregulated. Since their expression is associated with specific tumor types or with specific locations of tumors to a certain degree, they can, in a restricted sense, also be used as tumor markers. However, the regulation of claudin expression is complex involving growth factors and integrins, protein kinases, proto-oncogens and transcription factors. In this review, the significance of claudins is discussed in lung disease and development.","Soini, Ylermi",Respir Res,3,1

Thus, removing FH from the surface renders viruses, such as HIV, susceptible to CML. For a proof of concept, we developed a construct consisting of recombinant bifunctional single-chain variable fragment (scFv) based on a monoclonal antibody against Friend murine leukemia virus (F-MuLV) envelope protein gp70, which was coupled to specific binding domains (short consensus repeats 19-20; SCR1920) of FH. We used Pichia pastoris as expression system in common shake flasks and optimized expression in high density bench top fermentation. Specific binding of recombinant scFv was proven by flow cytometry. The recombinant scFv-SCR significantly enhanced CML of F-MuLV in vitro implying that FH binding to the viral surface was impaired by the scFv-SCR. This novel concept to enhance virolysis may provide a new approach for antiviral treatment.","Huber, Georg; Bánki, Zoltán; Kunert, Renate; Stoiber, Heribert",Biomed Res Int,3,1

This review summarizes the current biological activities of GA and its medical applications in liver diseases. The pharmacological actions of GA include inhibition of hepatic apoptosis and necrosis; anti-inflammatory and immune regulatory actions; antiviral effects; and antitumor effects. This paper will be a useful reference for physicians and biologists researching GA and will open the door to novel agents in drug discovery and development from Chinese herbs. With additional research, GA may be more widely used in the treatment of liver diseases or other conditions.","Li, Jian-yuan; Cao, Hong-yan; Liu, Ping; Cheng, Gen-hong; Sun, Ming-yu",Biomed Res Int,3,1
1704,1704,1704,A co-culture genome-wide RNAi screen with mammary epithelial cells reveals transmembrane signals required for growth and differentiation,13.892306,7.8240037,2015-01-09,"INTRODUCTION: The extracellular signals regulating mammary epithelial cell growth are of relevance to understanding the pathophysiology of mammary epithelia, yet they remain poorly characterized. In this study, we applied an unbiased approach to understanding the functional role of signalling molecules in several models of normal physiological growth and translated these results to the biological understanding of breast cancer subtypes. METHODS: We developed and utilized a cytogenetically normal clonal line of hTERT immortalized human mammary epithelial cells in a fibroblast-enhanced co-culture assay to conduct a genome-wide small interfering RNA (siRNA) screen for evaluation of the functional effect of silencing each gene. Our selected endpoint was inhibition of growth. In rigorous postscreen validation processes, including quantitative RT-PCR, to ensure on-target silencing, deconvolution of pooled siRNAs and independent confirmation of effects with lentiviral short-hairpin RNA constructs, we identified a subset of genes required for mammary epithelial cell growth. Using three-dimensional Matrigel growth and differentiation assays and primary human mammary epithelial cell colony assays, we confirmed that these growth effects were not limited to the 184-hTERT cell line. We utilized the METABRIC dataset of 1,998 breast cancer patients to evaluate both the differential expression of these genes across breast cancer subtypes and their prognostic significance. RESULTS: We identified 47 genes that are critically important for fibroblast-enhanced mammary epithelial cell growth. This group was enriched for several axonal guidance molecules and G protein–coupled receptors, as well as for the endothelin receptor PROCR. The majority of genes (43 of 47) identified in two dimensions were also required for three-dimensional growth, with HSD17B2, SNN and PROCR showing greater than tenfold reductions in acinar formation. Several genes, including PROCR and the neuronal pathfinding molecules EFNA4 and NTN1, were also required for proper differentiation and polarization in three-dimensional cultures. The 47 genes identified showed a significant nonrandom enrichment for differential expression among 10 molecular subtypes of breast cancer sampled from 1,998 patients. CD79A, SERPINH1, KCNJ5 and TMEM14C exhibited breast cancer subtype–independent overall survival differences. CONCLUSION: Diverse transmembrane signals are required for mammary epithelial cell growth in two-dimensional and three-dimensional conditions. Strikingly, we define novel roles for axonal pathfinding receptors and ligands and the endothelin receptor in both growth and differentiation.

2714,2714,2714,Can glypican-3 be a disease-specific biomarker?,14.235378,8.156877,2017-05-16,"BACKGROUND: Glypican-3 (GPC3) is a cell surface-bound proteoglycan which has been identified as a potential biomarker candidate in hepatocellular carcinoma, lung carcinoma, severe pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The aim of our review is to evaluate whether GPC3 has utility as a disease-specific biomarker, to discuss the potential involvement of GPC3 in cell biology, and to consider the changes of GPC3 gene and protein expression and regulation in hepatocellular carcinoma, lung cancer, severe pneumonia, and ARDS. RESULTS: Immunohistochemical studies have suggested that over-expression of GPC3 is associated with a poorer prognosis for hepatocellular carcinoma patients. Expression of GPC3 leads to an increased apoptosis response in human lung carcinoma tumor cells, and is considered to be a candidate lung tumor suppressor gene. Increased serum levels of GPC3 have been demonstrated in ARDS patients with severe pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: Glypican-3 could be considered as a clinically useful biomarker in hepatocellular carcinoma, lung carcinoma, and ARDS, but further research is needed to confirm and expand on these findings.","Chen, Chaolei; Huang, Xiaomin; Ying, Zhaojian; Wu, Dengmin; Yu, Yani; Wang, Xiangdong; Chen, Chengshui",Clin Transl Med,3,17
2902,2902,2902,Review article: the human intestinal virome in health and disease,14.246419,7.858611,2017-09-04,"BACKGROUND: The human virome consists of animal‐cell viruses causing transient infections, bacteriophage (phage) predators of bacteria and archaea, endogenous retroviruses and viruses causing persistent and latent infections. High‐throughput, inexpensive, sensitive sequencing methods and metagenomics now make it possible to study the contribution dsDNA, ssDNA and RNA virus‐like particles make to the human virome, and in particular the intestinal virome. AIM: To review and evaluate the pioneering studies that have attempted to characterise the human virome and generated an increased interest in understanding how the intestinal virome might contribute to maintaining health, and the pathogenesis of chronic diseases. METHODS: Relevant virome‐related articles were selected for review following extensive language‐ and date‐unrestricted, electronic searches of the literature. RESULTS: The human intestinal virome is personalised and stable, and dominated by phages. It develops soon after birth in parallel with prokaryotic communities of the microbiota, becoming established during the first few years of life. By infecting specific populations of bacteria, phages can alter microbiota structure by killing host cells or altering their phenotype, enabling phages to contribute to maintaining intestinal homeostasis or microbial imbalance (dysbiosis), and the development of chronic infectious and autoimmune diseases including HIV infection and Crohn's disease, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our understanding of the intestinal virome is fragmented and requires standardised methods for virus isolation and sequencing to provide a more complete picture of the virome, which is key to explaining the basis of virome‐disease associations, and how enteric viruses can contribute to disease aetiologies and be rationalised as targets for interventions.","Carding, S.

3805,3805,3805,Microglial cell loss after ischemic stroke favors brain neutrophil accumulation,14.243713,8.037354,2018-12-22,"Stroke attracts neutrophils to the injured brain tissue where they can damage the integrity of the blood–brain barrier and exacerbate the lesion. However, the mechanisms involved in neutrophil transmigration, location and accumulation in the ischemic brain are not fully elucidated. Neutrophils can reach the perivascular spaces of brain vessels after crossing the endothelial cell layer and endothelial basal lamina of post-capillary venules, or migrating from the leptomeninges following pial vessel extravasation and/or a suggested translocation from the skull bone marrow. Based on previous observations of microglia phagocytosing neutrophils recruited to the ischemic brain lesion, we hypothesized that microglial cells might control neutrophil accumulation in the injured brain. We studied a model of permanent occlusion of the middle cerebral artery in mice, including microglia- and neutrophil-reporter mice. Using various in vitro and in vivo strategies to impair microglial function or to eliminate microglia by targeting colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R), this study demonstrates that microglial phagocytosis of neutrophils has fundamental consequences for the ischemic tissue. We found that reactive microglia engulf neutrophils at the periphery of the ischemic lesion, whereas local microglial cell loss and dystrophy occurring in the ischemic core are associated with the accumulation of neutrophils first in perivascular spaces and later in the parenchyma. Accordingly, microglia depletion by long-term treatment with a CSF1R inhibitor increased the numbers of neutrophils and enlarged the ischemic lesion. Hence, microglial phagocytic function sets a critical line of defense against the vascular and tissue damaging capacity of neutrophils in brain ischemia.

AIM: We investigated vaccine effectiveness (VE) against laboratory-confirmed influenza and the impact of repeated vaccination over 10 previous seasons on current season VE among older adults. METHODS: We conducted an observational test-negative study in community-dwelling adults aged > 65 years in Ontario, Canada for the 2010/11 to 2015/16 seasons by linking laboratory and health administrative data. We estimated VE using multivariable logistic regression. We assessed the impact of repeated vaccination by stratifying by previous vaccination history. RESULTS: We included 58,304 testing episodes for respiratory viruses, with 11,496 (20%) testing positive for influenza and 31,004 (53%) vaccinated. Adjusted VE against laboratory-confirmed influenza for the six seasons combined was 21% (95% confidence interval (CI): 18 to 24%). Patients who were vaccinated in the current season, but had received no vaccinations in the previous 10 seasons, had higher current season VE (34%; 95%CI: 9 to 52%) than patients who had received 1–3 (26%; 95%CI: 13 to 37%), 4–6 (24%; 95%CI: 15 to 33%), 7–8 (13%; 95%CI: 2 to 22%), or 9–10 (7%; 95%CI: −4 to 16%) vaccinations (trend test p = 0.001). All estimates were higher after correcting for misclassification of current season vaccination status. For patients who were not vaccinated in the current season, residual protection rose significantly with increasing numbers of vaccinations received previously. CONCLUSIONS: Although VE appeared to decrease with increasing numbers of previous vaccinations, current season vaccination likely provides some protection against influenza regardless of the number of vaccinations received over the previous 10 influenza seasons.","Kwong, Jeffrey C; Chung, Hannah; Jung, James KH; Buchan, Sarah A; Campigotto, Aaron; Campitelli, Michael A; Crowcroft, Natasha S; Gubbay, Jonathan B; Karnauchow, Timothy; Katz, Kevin; McGeer, Allison J; McNally, J Dayre; Richardson, David C; Richardson, Susan E; Rosella, Laura C; Schwartz, Kevin L; Simor, Andrew; Smieja, Marek; Zahariadis, George",Euro Surveill,3,8

Allogeneic BMT, especially supported by T-cell-depleted stem cell products, is a risk factor for EBV-LPD. Although the risk of EBV-LPD after autologous transplantation is low, case reports of this complication in the autologous setting exist. We report a higher incidence than previously described of EBV-LPD in children undergoing sequential high-dose chemotherapy supported with CD34 selected peripheral blood stem cells (CD34+ PBSC). The median time to LPD after tandem transplant was 3 months (range 1–5 months). Five patients out of 156 (3.5%) developed EBV-LPD while enrolled on two trials of tandem autologous SCT in high-risk pediatric malignancies. Both studies employed five cycles of induction therapy, followed by tandem autologous PBSC transplants. In all, 108 out of 156 patients received CD34+ PBSC; 48 received unselected PBSC. All patients contracting LPD were from the CD34 selected group. Treatment of EBV-LPD included rituximab in four out of five patients, IVIg in two out of five patients, and gancyclovir in two out of five patients. EBV-LPD resolved in four out of five patients. We conclude that the combination of tandem SCT and CD34 selection may have increased immunosuppression in these patients to a point where there is an elevated risk of EBV-LPD.","Powell, J L; Bunin, N J; Callahan, C; Aplenc, R; Griffin, G; Grupp, S A",Bone Marrow Transplant,3,8

Here, we studied which molecular cardiac alterations are initiated after this treatment. Transcription profiling of endomyocardial biopsies with Affymetrix whole genome arrays was performed on 33 paired samples of DCM patients collected before and 6 months after IA/IgG. Therapy-related effects on myocardial protein levels were analysed by label-free proteome profiling for a subset of 23 DCM patients. Data were analysed regarding therapy-associated differences in gene expression and protein levels by comparing responders (defined by improvement of left ventricular ejection fraction ≥20 % relative and ≥5 % absolute) and non-responders. Responders to IA/IgG showed a decrease in serum N-terminal proBNP levels in comparison with baseline which was accompanied by a decreased expression of heart failure markers, such as angiotensin converting enzyme 2 or periostin. However, despite clinical improvement even in responders, IA/IgG did not trigger general inversion of DCM-associated molecular alterations in myocardial tissue. Transcriptome profiling revealed reduced gene expression for connective tissue growth factor, fibronectin, and collagen type I in responders. In contrast, in non-responders after IA/IgG, fibrosis-associated genes and proteins showed elevated levels, whereas values were reduced or maintained in responders. Thus, improvement of LV function after IA/IgG seems to be related to a reduced gene expression of heart failure markers and pro-fibrotic molecules as well as reduced fibrosis progression.

Soluble complement receptor 1 (sCR1) does not reduce the local or remote injury. Thus complement activation does not moderate cerulein-induced pancreatitis or the associated liver and lung injury. BACKGROUND: The local and remote injury of pancreatitis resembles other inflammatory events that are mediated by complement. This study examines the effect of complement inhibition with sCR1 in cerulein-induced pancreatitis in rats. METHODS: Thirteen Sprague-Dawley rats received five hourly subcutaneous doses of cerulein (100 μg initially, then 50 μg/kg). Six of these animals received hourly iv sCR1 (15 mg/kg, a proven complement-inhibiting dose in rats) and the other seven received iv saline. In parallel, 12 additional rats received hourly sc and iv saline. RESULTS: Compared to saline controls, rats receiving cerulein showed increased pancreatic wet-to-dry ratio (3.25∶8.52) hematocrit (40 to 47%), ascites volume (2.1 to 6.1 mL), serum amylase (1680 to 10,700 U/L), and ascites amylase (32,200 to 167,000 U/L) (allp<0.05). None of these parameters were modified by treatment with sCR1. Serum SGPT, which increased from 33.4 to 46.6 U/L in cerulein-infused rats, showed a trend toward reduction to 38.8 U/L in rats treated with sCR1. Cerulein-treated rats also had increased lung myeloperoxidase (0.069 to 0.097 U/g) and lung permeability, as assessed by alveolar lavage to serum ratio of labeled albumen (0.041∶0.121) (bothp<0.05). Neither were changed by sCR1 treatment.","Weiser, Martin R.; Gibbs, Simon A. L.; Moore, Francis D.; Hechtman, Herbert B.",Int J Gastrointest Cancer,3,31

Epidemiological data, antimicrobial susceptibility, clinical patterns, underlying illnesses, type of infection, admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), number of episodes, coinfection, antimicrobial therapy, and evolution were analyzed. A total of 221 clinical samples from 204 patients were positive for Aeromonas spp. The mean age of the patients was 67.6 years. The main clinical form of presentation was gastrointestinal (78.4%). Malignancy was the main risk group in 69 (33.8%) patients, and 48 (23.5%) were previously healthy. Twenty-one patients (10.3%) were admitted to the ICU. Infections were acquired in the hospital in 52.5% of the patients, and 28.9% were polymicrobial. The overall mortality (after 1 year of follow-up from the first positive culture) was 26.5%. Univariate analysis identified an association between increased mortality and the following variables: age ≥80 years, hospitalization, admission to the ICU, malignancy, extraintestinal infection, and appropriate antimicrobial therapy. In the multivariate analysis, age ≥80 years [odds ratio (OR), 4.37 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.68–11.35; p = 0.002]], admission to the ICU (OR, 6.59 [95% CI, 2.17–19.99; p = 0.001]), and malignancy (OR, 3.62 [95% CI, 1.32–9.90; p = 0.012]) were significantly associated with mortality. Aeromonas infections are mainly gastrointestinal. The 1-year follow-up mortality rate was high. Old age (age ≥80 years), admission to the ICU, and malignancy were identified as independent risk factors for mortality.","Nolla-Salas, J.; Codina-Calero, J.; Vallés-Angulo, S.; Sitges-Serra, A.; Zapatero-Ferrándiz, A.; Climent, M.

Until recently, the use of BAL was limited primarily to two areas: the study of interstitial lung diseases and the diagnosis of lung infections by opportunistic microorganisms in severely immunocompromised patients with lung infiltrates. Over the past decade, the use of BAL has been expanded to include the conventional diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia in non-immunocompromised patients. In the past, different clinical studies proposed using BAL to quantify cultures in the sample obtained as a means of increasing the tool's effectiveness. Recent developments have led to a number of newer applications of BAL, such as bronchoscopic BAL, non-bronchoscopic BAL and protected BAL.

Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is one of the ideal therapeutic agents for prevention of lung fibrosis because of its antiapoptotic and fibrinolytic effects. The aim of this study is to establish nonviral HGF gene therapy of bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis avoiding the viral vector-related side effects. C57BL/6 mice were injected with 3.0 mg/kg body weight of bleomycin intratracheally. Following bleomycin injection, 50 μl of pUC-HGF (1 mg/ml) was injected into each of the quadriceps muscle. Immediately after plasmid injection, in vivo electroporation was performed with pulse generator. Skeletal muscle-targeting electroporation induced transgene expression on day 1 and persisted for 4 weeks, and human HGF was also detected in the lung. In mice transferred with HGF, pathological score (1.0±0.3 vs 3.2±0.6), TUNEL-positive cell index (4.5±1.1 vs 14.2±3.1), and hydroxyproline content (9.0±1.3 vs 14.4±5.1 μmol/g) were significantly reduced compared with the control. Furthermore, survival rate of HGF mice was significantly improved compared with the control. Our data indicate that HGF gene therapy with a single skeletal muscle-targeting electroporation has a therapeutic potential for bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis and this strategy can be applied as a practical gene therapy protocol for various organs.","Umeda, Yukio; Marui, Tsutomu; Matsuno, Yukihiro; Shirahashi, Koyo; Iwata, Hisashi; Takagi, Hisato; Matsumoto, Kunio; Nakamura, Toshikazu; Kosugi, Atsushi; Mori, Yoshio; Takemura, Hirofumi",Lab Invest,3,22

In comparison with patients treated with high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation, patients undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation are at a much higher risk of infection even after hematopoietic reconstitution, due to the delayed recovery of T and B cell functions. The rate at which immune function recovers after hematopoietic reconstitution greatly influences the incidence and type of post-transplant infectious complications.

Nutrients have marked influences on the gastrointestinal tract and manipulation of the diet provides clinicians with a powerful therapeutic strategy to be used alone or concurrently with drug therapy. During acute gastroenteritis a change from the animal's regular food to a diet containing novel protein sources minimizes the likelihood of acquired food allergies to the staple protein components of the diet. “Feeding through” diarrhea, a method used in human infants, has limited applicability in dogs and cats. The ideal diet for chronic small bowel-type diarrhea is highly digestible, gluten-free, hypoallergenic, isosmolar, low in fat and low in lactose. Dietary protein requirements increase in protein-losing enteropathy. Dietary fat is kept to a minimum during gastrointestinal dysfunction because malabsorbed fatty acids and bile acids cause secretory diarrhea. In diseases of the small bowel, it is traditional to use low fiber diets. This recommendation needs revision because the binding and gelling properties of fiber are of potential benefit in the treatment of small bowel diarrhea. High fiber diets are useful in most large bowel diseases. The specific fiber type used markedly influences the clinical result.","Guilford, W. Grant",J Nutr,3,1

Significant up-regulation of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)–related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and TNF-α, but not Fas ligand (FasL) mRNA, was detected in human monocyte–derived macrophages (MDMs) infected with avian influenza viruses A/Hong Kong/483/97 (H5N1/97) or its precursor, A/Quail/Hong Kong/G1/97. H5N1/97-infected MDMs exhibited the strongest induction of apoptosis in Jurkat T cells, and it could be reduced by TRAIL–receptor 2 blocking antibody. Furthermore, influenza virus infection enhanced the sensitivity of Jurkat T cells to apoptosis induced by TNF-α, TRAIL, and FasL. Our data suggested that functional TRAIL produced by influenza virus–infected MDMs was related to their cytotoxicity and that the enhanced sensitization to DRL-induced apoptosis detected in avian influenza may contribute to disease pathogenesis","Zhou, Jianfang; Law, Helen K.

Report of a Working Party of the British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy and the Society of Pharmaceutical Medicine.,13.806385,8.205274,1997-12-11,"These guidelines deal with the evaluation of anti-infective drugs for the treatment of respiratory tract infections. Five clinical entities are described: streptococcal pharyngitis and tonsillitis, otitis media, sinusitis, bronchitis, and pneumonia. A wide variety of microorganisms are potentially pathogenetic in these diseases; these guidelines focus on the bacterial infections. Inclusion of a patient in a trial of a new drug is based on the clinical entity, with the requirement that a reasonable attempt will be made to establish a specific microbial etiology. Microbiologic evaluation of efficacy requires isolation of the pathogen and testing for in vitro susceptibility. Alternatively, surrogate markers may be used to identify the etiologic agent. The efficacy of new drugs is evaluated with reference to anticipated response rates. Establishment of the microbial etiology of respiratory tract infections is hampered by the presence of “normal flora” of the nose, mouth, and pharynx, which may include asymptomatic carriage of potential pathogens. This issue is addressed for each category of infection described. For example, it is suggested that for initial phase 2 trials of acute otitis media and acute sinusitis tympanocentesis or direct sinus puncture be used to collect exudate for culture. Acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis also present difficulties in the establishment of microbial etiology. These guidelines suggest that clinical trials employ an active control drug but leave open the possibility of a placebo-controlled trial. For pneumonia, the guidelines suggest the identification and enrollment of patients by the clinical type of pneumonia, e.g., atypical pneumonia or acute bacterial pneumonia, rather than by etiologic organism or according to whether it was community or hospital acquired. For each respiratory infection, the clinical response is judged as cure, failure, or indeterminate. Clinical improvement is not acceptable unless quantitative response measures can be applied.","Chow, Anthony W.; Hall, Caroline B.; Klein, Jerome O.; Kammer, Robert B.; Meyer, Richard D.; Remington, Jack S.",Clin Infect Dis,3,19

It is estimated that in the United States approximately $ 652 million per year is spent on medical costs for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) related disease alone (Paramore et al., 2004). Viruses cause a variety of respiratory diseases in children from the common cold to life-threatening pneumonia and bronchiolitis. The host reacts to a viral infection with a combination of innate and adaptive immune mechanisms, usually resulting in the clearance of the virus and clinical recovery. However, there is an accumulating evidence for a number of viral infections that the host immune response actually enhances disease in the course of clearing virus from the infected organs. Interestingly, the effectiveness of the immune response seems to be dependent on the age and probably genetic background of the child. This has important implications for treatment as well as vaccine development.","Lindemans, Caroline A.; Kimpen, Jan L. L.",Hot Topics in Infection and Immunity in Children II,3,1

Thanks to the Global Rinderpest Eradication Program which involves vaccination, trade restrictions, and surveillance, rinderpest may soon become only the second disease (after smallpox) to be globally eradicated.

Detailed studies on the life-cycle and the ultrastructure have provided a better understanding of the biology of the parasite and have highlighted its unique characteristics. Of these, the existence of sporulated, thin-walled oocysts, and their independence of reducing conditions for excystation are of major importance and may explain the occurrence of autoinfection and persistent infection. Cryptosporidium has numerous characteristics that set it apart from the rest of that subclass.

Our aim was to analyse admissions due to respiratory infections in moderate, late and term infants, and to identify risk factors for hospitalisation in preterm versus term. METHODS: Prospective study in a cohort of moderate and late preterm, and term infants born between October/2011 and December/2012. Admissions due to respiratory infections during the first year of life were analysed and compared among moderate (32–33), late (34–36) and term infants. Sixteen respiratory viruses were detected by RT-PCR. Clinical data were collected. RESULTS: 30 (20.9%) out of 143 preterm infants required admission for respiratory infection, versus 129 (6.9%) of 1858 term infants born in the same period (p < 0.0001, OR: 3.6 CI 2.0 to 5.0). Hospitalised children had a higher prevalence of hyaline membrane disease (HMD) at birth (p < 0.001, OR: 7.7 CI: 2.121 to 27.954) and needed more mechanical ventilation (p < 0.001, OR: 5.7 CI: 1.813 to 18.396).

CONCLUSIONS: The risk of respiratory admissions during the first year of life is up to 3.6 times higher in moderate and late preterm. Once admitted, clinical features of respiratory episodes requiring hospitalisation are similar among term and preterm infants.

The studies were done by assaying synaptic concentrations of DA and 5-HT in the presence of the neuronal impulse flow inhibitor, γ-butyrolactone (γ-BL). The results were compared with cocaine effects on accumbens DA and 5-HT in the freely moving rat, without γ-BL treatment. A neurochemical time course profile showed that the cocaine-induced increase in accumbens synaptic concentrations of DA was significantly blocked (p<0.0001) after DA impulse flow was significantly inhibited (p<0.0038) by γ-BL (35.8%). The neurochemical time course profile concurrently showed that the cocaine-induced decrease in accumbens synaptic concentrations of 5-HT was significantly blocked (p<0.0004) after impulse flow was significantly inhibited (p<0.025) by γ-BL (50.6%). The findings show that cocaine's effects on synaptic concentrations for DA and for HT in accumbens are dependent on neuronal impulse flow.

We found abundant expression of citrullinated histone H3 (Cit-H3) and the formation of NETs at the onset of ARDS in all cases. The amounts of Cit-H3 and NETs decreased with the amelioration of respiratory failure in cases 1 and 2. In case 2, the amounts of Cit-H3 and NETs increased with aggravation of infection and respiratory status. In case 3, the abundant expression of Cit-H3 and NETs persisted; the patient did not recover from ARDS and eventually died. Cit-H3 and NETs were found in tracheal aspirates even if the patients had no direct injury to the lung as in cases 1 and 2. CONCLUSIONS: In these three cases, the formation of NETs was observed in tracheal aspirate of patients with ARDS by either direct or indirect insults to the lung. The amount of NET formation changed dynamically over the clinical course of each patient.","Ojima, Masahiro; Yamamoto, Norihisa; Hirose, Tomoya; Hamaguchi, Shigeto; Tasaki, Osamu; Kojima, Takashi; Tomono, Kazunori; Ogura, Hiroshi; Shimazu, Takeshi",J Intensive Care,3,1

METHODS: Gene expression was analyzed in the livers of patients with primary biliary cholangitis (n = 15) and primary sclerosing cholangitis (n = 15). Bile duct ligation (BDL) or sham operation was performed in wild-type (WT) and Caspase-1(–/–) (Casp1(–/–)) mice for 7 days. Mouse hepatocytes and macrophages were treated with bile acids. RESULTS: Caspase-1, NLRP1, NLRP3 and IL-1β were significantly increased in the livers of cholestatic patients when compared to healthy control subjects (n = 9). Significantly higher levels of plasma IL-1β (826 vs 345 pg/ml), ALT (674 vs 482 U/L) and ALP (900 vs 622 U/L) were seen in WT BDL mice compared to Casp1(–/–) BDL mice. Caspase-1 cleavage was found only in WT BDL livers. Assessment of liver histology indicated more fibrosis in Casp1(–/–) BDL mice than in WT BDL mice, confirmed by analyses of liver hydroxyproline content and the expression of fibrotic genes. Profiling of immune cells revealed that there were more macrophages in Casp1(–/–) BDL livers than in WT BDL livers. Further macrophage phenotype characterization indicated that Casp1(–/–) BDL livers had more M2 anti-inflammatory macrophages evidenced by more CD206 positive cells and higher expression of IL-4, CD163, Fizz1 and IL-33. When mouse hepatocytes and peritoneal macrophages were exposed to cholestatic levels of major endogenous bile acids (300μM TCA), neither IL-1β induction nor procaspase-1 cleavage were detected. CONCLUSIONS: The inflammasome exacerbates cholestatic liver injury, but bile acids do not directly activate the inflammasome.","Cai, Shi-Ying; Ge, Maoxu; Mennone, Albert; Hoque, Rafaz; Ouyang, Xinshou; Boyer, James L.",Cell Mol Gastroenterol Hepatol,3,1

Experimental determination of peptides' antiviral activity as expressed by their IC(50) values involves a lot of effort. Therefore, we have developed “AVP‐IC(50)Pred,” a regression‐based algorithm to predict the antiviral activity in terms of IC(50) values (μM). A total of 759 non‐redundant peptides from AVPdb and HIPdb were divided into a training/test set having 683 peptides (T(683)) and a validation set with 76 independent peptides (V(76)) for evaluation. We utilized important peptide sequence features like amino‐acid compositions, binary profile of N8‐C8 residues, physicochemical properties and their hybrids. Four different machine learning techniques (MLTs) namely Support vector machine, Random Forest, Instance‐based classifier, and K‐Star were employed. During 10‐fold cross validation, we achieved maximum Pearson correlation coefficients (PCCs) of 0.66, 0.64, 0.56, 0.55, respectively, for the above MLTs using the best combination of feature sets. All the predictive models also performed well on the independent validation dataset and achieved maximum PCCs of 0.74, 0.68, 0.59, 0.57, respectively, on the best combination of feature sets. The AVP‐IC(50)Pred web server is anticipated to assist the researchers working on antiviral therapeutics by enabling them to computationally screen many compounds and focus experimental validation on the most promising set of peptides, thus reducing cost and time efforts.

While multiple methods having been created to characterize this variation through the identification of groups of species that tend to co‐occur, most of these methods unfortunately are not able to represent gradual variation in species composition. The Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model is a mixed‐membership method that can represent gradual changes in community structure by delineating overlapping groups of species, but its use has been limited because it requires abundance data and requires users to a priori set the number of groups. We substantially extend LDA to accommodate widely available presence/absence data and to simultaneously determine the optimal number of groups. Using simulated data, we show that this model is able to accurately determine the true number of groups, estimate the underlying parameters, and fit with the data. We illustrate this method with data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS). Overall, our model identified 18 main bird groups, revealing striking spatial patterns for each group, many of which were closely associated with temperature and precipitation gradients. Furthermore, by comparing the estimated proportion of each group for two time periods (1997–2002 and 2010–2015), our results indicate that nine (of 18) breeding bird groups exhibited an expansion northward and contraction southward of their ranges, revealing subtle but important community‐level biodiversity changes at a continental scale that are consistent with those expected under climate change. Our proposed method is likely to find multiple uses in ecology, being a valuable addition to the toolkit of ecologists.","Valle, Denis; Albuquerque, Pedro; Zhao, Qing; Barberan, Albert; Fletcher, Robert J.",Glob Chang Biol,3,1

In this study, a kind of highly biocompatible CDs (Gly‐CDs) is synthesized from active ingredient (glycyrrhizic acid) of Chinese herbal medicine by a hydrothermal method. Using the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) as a model, it is found that the Gly‐CDs inhibit PRRSV proliferation by up to 5 orders of viral titers. Detailed investigations reveal that Gly‐CDs can inhibit PRRSV invasion and replication, stimulate antiviral innate immune responses, and inhibit the accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) caused by PRRSV infection. Proteomics analysis demonstrates that Gly‐CDs can stimulate cells to regulate the expression of some host restriction factors, including DDX53 and NOS3, which are directly related to PRRSV proliferation. Moreover, it is found that Gly‐CDs also remarkably suppress the propagation of other viruses, such as pseudorabies virus (PRV) and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), suggesting the broad antiviral activity of Gly‐CDs. The integrated results demonstrate that Gly‐CDs possess extraordinary antiviral activity with multisite inhibition mechanisms, providing a promising candidate for alternative therapy for PRRSV infection.","Tong, Ting; Hu, Hongwei; Zhou, Junwei; Deng, Shuangfei; Zhang, Xiaotong; Tang, Wantao; Fang, Liurong; Xiao, Shaobo; Liang, Jiangong",Small,3,1

The sera were assayed for total IgE by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Calves were found to have significant levels of IgE during the first week postpartum, indicating colostral transfer of IgE. Thereafter, serum levels declined rapidly within 3 weeks from birth. The IgE levels began to increase after 12 weeks of age, and in some cases reached adult levels.

We performed 54 cases of ventricular septal defect (VSD) closure via anterolateral thoracotomy approach with central cannulation. Here we are describing our results and experience of VSD closure via anterolateral thoracotomy approach. AIM AND OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to evaluate early outcomes of VSD repair via anterolateral thoracotomy with central cannulation. METHODS: This is a retrospective, observational, descriptive type of study. Fifty four patients (31 males, 23 females) underwent VSD repair from November 2016 to November 2018 via anterolateral thoracotomy with age ranges from 3 to 22 years (mean age 10.57 + 8.88 years). Mean body weight was 22.29 + 13.44 kg (range 10 to 48 kg). The VSD was perimembranous in 47 patients, subpulmonic in 2, muscular in 2, and inlet in 3 patients. RESULTS: There was no operative or late mortality. The mean incision length was 7.16 ± 02.08 cm (range, 5 cm to 9 cm). Average duration of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was 61.72 ± 14.20 min (range, 48–78 min), and aortic cross-clamp time was 38.51 ± 13.08 min (range, 26–56 min). The average postoperative intensive care unit (ICU) stay was 1.83 ± 1.32 days (range, 1–3 days), and hospital stay was 4.92 ± 1.82 days (range, 4–7 days). CONCLUSION: Anterolateral thoracotomy with conventional central cannulation can be a safe alternative to median sternotomy with superior cosmetic results for the repair of VSDs.","Dixit, Sunil; Sharma, Anil; Suthar, Jaikishan; Watti, Vikram; Sharma, Mohit",Indian J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg,3,1

Domain 1 sequences of 188 HCV samples isolated from 2006 to 2017, Iran, were retrieved from NCBI gene bank. Using several tools, all sequences were analyzed for determination of mutations, physicochemical analysis, B-cell epitopes prediction, T-cell and CTL epitopes prediction, post modification, secondary and tertiary structure prediction. Our analysis determined several mutations in some special positions (70, 90, 91, and 110) that are associated with HCC and hepatocarcinogenesis, efficacy of triple therapy and sustained virological response, and interaction between core and CCR6. Several B-cell, T-cell, and CTL epitopes were recognized. Secondary and tertiary structures were mapped fordomain1 and core proteins. Our study, as a first report, offered inclusive data about frequent mutation in HCV-core gene domain 1 in Iranian sequences that can provide helpful analysis on structure and function of domain 1 of the core gene.","Dehghani, Behzad; Hashempour, Tayebeh; Hasanshahi, Zahra; Moayedi, Javad",Int J Pept Res Ther,3,1

To systematically identify candidate regulatory variants, we sequenced ENCODE cell lines and used public ChIP-seq data to look for transcription factors binding preferentially to one allele. We found 9962 candidate regulatory SNPs, of which 16 % were rare and showed evidence of larger functional effect than common ones. Functionally rare variants may explain divergent GWAS results between populations and are candidates for a partial explanation of the missing heritability. The majority of allele-specific variants (96 %) were specific to a cell type. Furthermore, by examining GWAS loci we found >400 allele-specific candidate SNPs, 141 of which were highly relevant in our cell types. Functionally validated SNPs support identification of an SNP in SYNGR1 which may expose to the risk of rheumatoid arthritis and primary biliary cirrhosis, as well as an SNP in the last intron of COG6 exposing to the risk of psoriasis. We propose that by repeating the ChIP-seq experiments of 20 selected transcription factors in three to ten people, the most common polymorphisms can be interrogated for allele-specific binding.

Our data show that incubation of human coronary artery SMC (HCASMC) with low concentration of ELDL (10 μg/ml) results in significantly enhanced foam cell formation compared to oxidized LDL (200 μg/ml; p < 0.01) or native LDL (200 μg/ml; p < 0.01). Bioinformatic network analysis identified activation of p38 MAPK, NFkB, ERK as top canonical pathways relevant for biological processes linked to cell migration and osteoblastic differentiation in ELDL-treated cells. Functional studies confirmed increased migration of HCASMC upon stimulation with ELDL (10 μg/ml) or Angiopoietin like protein 4, (ANGPTL4, 5 μg/ml), and gain in osteoblastic gene profile with significant increase in mRNA levels for DMP-1, ALPL, RUNX2, OPN/SPP1, osterix/SP7, BMP and reduction in mRNA for MGP and ENPP1. Enhanced calcification of HCASMC by ELDL was demonstrated by Alizarin Red staining. In summary, ELDL is highly potent in inducing foam cells in HCASMC and mediates a phenotypic switch with enhanced migration and osteoblastic gene profile. These results point to the potential of ELDL to induce migratory and osteoblastic effects in human smooth muscle cells with potential implications for migration and calcification of SMCs in human atherosclerosis.","Chellan, Bijoy; Rojas, Elizabeth; Zhang, Chunling; Hofmann Bowman, Marion A.",Sci Rep,3,22

This review will examinethe role of exercise and nutritional intervention as countermeasures to these disease risks. RECENT FINDINGS: The CMS hazards of overweight/obesity, insulin resistance, hypertension, and dyslipidemia are strongly associated with physical deconditioning and are common after SCI. Both the CMS diagnosis and physical deconditioning worsen the prognosis for all-cause cardiovascular disease occurring early after SCI. Evidence supports a therapeutic role for physical activity after SCI as an effective countermeasure to these risks and often represents the first-line approach to CMS abatement. This evidence is supported by authoritative systematic reviews and associated guidelines that recommend specific activities, frequencies, and activities of work. In many cases, the most effective exercise programming uses more intense periods of work with limited rest. As SCI is also associated with poor dietary habits, including excessive energy intake and saturated fat consumption, more comprehensive lifestyle management incorporating both exercise and nutrition represents a preferred approach for overall health management. SUMMARY: Irrespective of the interventional strategy, improved surveillance of the population for CMS risks and encouraged incorporation of exercise and nutritional management according to recent population-specific guidelines will most likely play an important role in the preservation of activity, optimal health, and independence throughout the lifespan.","Nash, Mark S.; Bilzon, James L.

The paucity of detailed biomechanical data from real-world trauma in children has hampered development of biomechanical thresholds for skull fracture in infants. The objectives of this study were to identify biomechanical metrics to predict skull fracture, determine threshold values associated with fracture, and develop skull fracture risk curves for low-height falls in infants. To achieve these objectives, we utilized an integrated approach consisting of case evaluation, anthropomorphic reconstruction, and finite element simulation. Four biomechanical candidates for predicting skull fracture were identified (first principal stress, first principal strain, shear stress, and von Mises stress) and evaluated against well-witnessed falls in infants (0–6 months). Among the predictor candidates, first principal stress and strain correlated best with the occurrence of parietal skull fracture. The principal stress and strain thresholds associated with 50 and 95% probability of parietal skull fracture were 25.229 and 36.015 MPa and 0.0464 and 0.0699, respectively. Risk curves using these predictors determined that infant falls from 0.3 m had a low probability (0–54%) to result in parietal skull fracture, particularly with carpet impact (0–1%). Head-first falls from 0.9 m had a high probability of fracture (86–100%) for concrete impact and a moderate probability (34–81%) for carpet impact. Probabilities of fracture in 0.6 m falls were dependent on impact surface. Occipital impacts from 0.9 m onto the concrete also had the potential (27–90% probability) to generate parietal skull fracture. These data represent a multi-faceted biomechanical assessment of infant skull fracture risk and can assist in the differential diagnosis for head trauma in children.

Previous study has shown that after multiple dosages, alflutinib exhibits nonlinear pharmacokinetics and displays a time- and dose-dependent increase in the apparent clearance, probably due to its self-induction of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme. In this study, we investigated the CYP isozymes involved in the metabolism of alflutinib and evaluated the enzyme inhibition and induction potential of alflutinib and its metabolites. The data showed that alflutinib in human liver microsomes (HLMs) was metabolized mainly by CYP3A4, which could catalyze the formation of AST5902. Alflutinib did not inhibit CYP isozymes in HLMs but could induce CYP3A4 in human hepatocytes. Rifampin is a known strong CYP3A4 inducer and is recommended by the FDA as a positive control in the CYP3A4 induction assay. We found that the induction potential of alflutinib was comparable to that of rifampin. The E(max) of CYP3A4 induction by alflutinib in three lots of human hepatocytes were 9.24-, 11.2-, and 10.4-fold, while the fold-induction of rifampin (10 μM) were 7.22-, 19.4- and 9.46-fold, respectively. The EC(50) of alflutinib-induced CYP3A4 mRNA expression was 0.25 μM, which was similar to that of rifampin. In addition, AST5902 exhibited much weak CYP3A4 induction potential compared to alflutinib. Given the plasma exposure of alflutinib and AST5902, both are likely to affect the pharmacokinetics of CYP3A4 substrates. Considering that alflutinib is a CYP3A4 substrate and a potent CYP3A4 inducer, drug–drug interactions are expected during alflutinib treatment.","Liu, Xiao-yun; Guo, Zi-tao; Chen, Zhen-dong; Zhang, Yi-fan; Zhou, Jia-lan; Jiang, Yong; Zhao, Qian-yu; Diao, Xing-xing; Zhong, Da-fang",Acta Pharmacol Sin,3,1

METHODS: A literature search was performed on Pubmed, ScienceDirect and EMBASE. Keywords: ‘herbal medicine’ OR ‘herbal and dietary supplement’ OR ‘complementary and alternative medicine’ AND ‘reason’ OR ‘attitude’. Quantitative or qualitative original articles in English, published between 2003 and 2018 were reviewed. Conference proceedings, pilot studies, protocols, letters, and reviews were excluded. Papers were appraised using valid tools and a ‘risk of bias’ assessment was also performed. Thematic analysis was conducted. Reasons were coded in each paper, then codes were grouped into categories. If several categories reported similar reasons, these were combined into a theme. Themes were then analysed using χ(2) tests to identify the main factors related to reasons for CAM usage. RESULTS: 231 publications were included. Reasons for CAM use amongst general and condition-specific populations were similar. The top three reasons for CAM use were: (1) having an expectation of benefits of CAM (84% of publications), (2) dissatisfaction with conventional medicine (37%) and (3) the perceived safety of CAM (37%). Internal health locus of control as an influencing factor was more likely to be reported in Western populations, whereas the social networks was a common factor amongst Asian populations (p < 0.05). Affordability, easy access to CAM and tradition were significant factors amongst African populations (p < 0.05). Negative attitudes towards CAM and satisfaction with conventional medicine (CM) were the main reasons for non-use (p < 0.05).

Here, we find that OIP5-AS1 is overexpressed in NPC patient specimens and NPC cell lines. Further investigations reveal that knockdown of OIP5-AS1 significantly inhibits the proliferation, migration, and invasion and accelerates the apoptosis of NPC cells in vitro. Consistent with these findings, NPC progression is significantly slowed in mice when OIP5-AS1 is knocked down. Interestingly, there is a functional link between OIP5-AS1 and microRNA-203 (miR-203), a tumor suppressor, in NPC cells. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that OIP5-AS1 plays an important role in the development and progression of NPC by targeting miR-203 and therefore provide a promising target for the treatment of NPC.","Tang, Jian; Fu, Chengxiao; Li, Yanwen; Chen, Shuangqin; Jiang, Xiaoxin; Xu, Wenqian; Xie, Haitao",Biomed Res Int,3,1

Since 20th-century, advances in analytical chemistry have allowed disclosure of the chemical nature of these molecules. The chemical profile of extracts obtained from previously selected species was investigated to try to establish a bridge between traditional background and scientific data. The study of the chemical composition of these extracts has permitted us to correlate the presence of tannins and other related molecules with the effectiveness of their apparent uses. The revision of traditional knowledge paired with scientific evidence may provide a supporting background on their use and the basis for developing innovative pharmacology and food applications based on formulations using natural sources of tannins. This traditional-scientific approach can result useful due to the raising consumers’ demand for natural products in markets, to which tannin-rich extracts may pose an attractive alternative. Therefore, it is of interest to back traditional applications with accurate data while meeting consumer’s acceptance. In this review, several species known to contain high amounts of tannins have been selected as a starting point to establish a correlation between their alleged traditional use, tannins content and composition and potential bioaccessibility.","Fraga-Corral, Maria; Otero, Paz; Cassani, Lucia; Echave, Javier; Garcia-Oliveira, Paula; Carpena, Maria; Chamorro, Franklin; Lourenço-Lopes, Catarina; Prieto, Miguel A.; Simal-Gandara, Jesus",Foods,3,8

Treatment of late-stage tumors has become a significant burden on the healthcare system globally. Adoptive cell immunotherapy is supposed to prolong life with cancer and ideally cure cancer after a single infusion of the cell product. Arguably, the most impressive clinical therapy in this field is based on chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells capable of curing up to 25–50% of previously incurable patients with B-cell malignancies. Diverse cell therapies are already efficiently used in clinics for cancer treatment (such as tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, transgenic αβ T-cells) and several novel promising cell therapies are in development (such as CAR M-cells, transgenic γδ T-cells, CAR NK-cells). Here, we summarize the recent literature data with the focus on T-cell receptor-based therapies and overview the most advanced systems for manufacturing of clinical grade cell products. ABSTRACT: Adoptive cell immunotherapy (ACT) is a vibrant field of cancer treatment that began progressive development in the 1980s. One of the most prominent and promising examples is chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell immunotherapy for the treatment of B-cell hematologic malignancies. Despite success in the treatment of B-cell lymphomas and leukemia, CAR T-cell therapy remains mostly ineffective for solid tumors. This is due to several reasons, such as the heterogeneity of the cellular composition in solid tumors, the need for directed migration and penetration of CAR T-cells against the pressure gradient in the tumor stroma, and the immunosuppressive microenvironment. To substantially improve the clinical efficacy of ACT against solid tumors, researchers might need to look closer into recent developments in the other branches of adoptive immunotherapy, both traditional and innovative. In this review, we describe the variety of adoptive cell therapies beyond CAR T-cell technology, i.e., exploitation of alternative cell sources with a high therapeutic potential against solid tumors (e.g., CAR M-cells) or aiming to be universal allogeneic (e.g., CAR NK-cells, γδ T-cells), tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), and transgenic T-cell receptor (TCR) T-cell immunotherapies. In addition, we discuss the strategies for selection and validation of neoantigens to achieve efficiency and safety. We provide an overview of non-conventional TCRs and CARs, and address the problem of mispairing between the cognate and transgenic TCRs. Finally, we summarize existing and emerging approaches for manufacturing of the therapeutic cell products in traditional, semi-automated and fully automated Point-of-Care (PoC) systems.","Titov, Aleksei; Zmievskaya, Ekaterina; Ganeeva, Irina; Valiullina, Aygul; Petukhov, Alexey; Rakhmatullina, Aygul; Miftakhova, Regina; Fainshtein, Michael; Rizvanov, Albert; Bulatov, Emil",Cancers (Basel),3,1

Their role in cancer is poorly investigated, and research focusses on Siglec-expression on immune cells interacting with tumor cells. This study evaluates the role of Siglec-8 in breast cancer (BC). Siglec-8 expression was analyzed immunohistochemically on 235 primary BC cases and was correlated with clinical and pathological parameters and outcome. Cell culture experiments were performed with various BC cell lines. Siglec-8 was expressed in 215 BC cases and expression was lowest in triple-negative BC. It correlated with estrogen receptor-status, grading and the prognostic factors galectin (Gal)-7 and tumor-associated mucin-1 (TA-MUC1). However, Gal-7 and TA-MUC1 were only prognosticators for clinical outcome in the cohort expressing high (Immunoreactivity score IRS > 3) Siglec-8 levels but not in the low-expressing cohort. Siglec-8 knockdown led to a significantly reduced Gal-7 expression in MCF7 cells. All BC cell lines expressed low Siglec-8-levels, that could be elevated in MCF7 by Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPARγ)-stimulation. This study demonstrates that Siglec-8 is expressed in BC cells and correlates with known clinical and prognostic parameters. It is probably associated with Gal-7 and TA-MUC1 and might be regulated via PPARγ. Further analyses focusing on functional associations will clarify Siglec-8’s eligibility as a possible therapeutic target.","Trebo, Anna; Ditsch, Nina; Degenhardt, Tom; Kuhn, Christina; Rahmeh, Martina; Schmoeckel, Elisa; Mayr, Doris; Czogalla, Bastian; Kolben, Thomas; Meister, Sarah; Mahner, Sven; Jeschke, Udo; Hester, Anna",Int J Mol Sci,3,1

Even if rescued with central aortic repair, some patients develop permanent postoperative neurological deficiency postoperatively. We recently introduced direct common carotid artery perfusion for acute type A aortic dissection involving the common carotid artery. This study introduced this technique to prevent postoperative neurological deficiency by comparing brain protection strategies. METHODS: Among 91 acute type A aortic dissection patients treated at our hospital during August 2015–October 2020, the common carotid artery was involved in 19 (21%), which had > 90% stenosis in either of the carotid arteries on preoperative contrast-enhanced computed tomography. Twelve patients underwent conventional selective cerebral perfusion during August 2015–December 2018 and seven patients underwent direct carotid artery perfusion during January 2019–October 2020. We assessed patient characteristics, surgical courses, clinical outcomes, and neurological outcomes. RESULTS: The mean age was 69 (range 39–84) years; 17 patients were male (89%). Eight patients (42%) had neurological symptoms. Concomitant procedures, postoperative neurological symptoms, and late mortality were significantly associated with conventional selective cerebral perfusion. Five selective cerebral perfusion patients experienced worsened neurological symptoms and two died of broad cerebral ischemia. No direct carotid artery perfusion patient died during hospitalization or experienced worsened neurological outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Direct carotid artery perfusion may be useful in aortic dissection with brain ischemia because it does not aggravate neurological symptoms and is not associated with intraoperative cerebral infarction. However, it may be ineffective when cerebral infarction has already developed.","Sugiyama, Kayo; Watanuki, Hirotaka; Futamura, Yasuhiro; Okada, Masaho; Oiwa, Tatsunori; Makino, Satoshi; Matsuyama, Katsuhiko",Gen Thorac Cardiovasc Surg,3,1

Its rapid expansion allowed the SUS to meet the changing health care needs of the population remote localities of Brazilian municipalities. METHODS: In the present study, exploratory data analysis was performed using modelling to provide a general overview of the study and to delineate possible structural characteristics of the cross-sectional time-series data. Panel regression methods were used to assess the association between FHS coverage and ambulatory care-sensitive hospitalizations (ACSH rates) in the municipalities of Pará, in the Brazilian Amazon, from 2008 to 2017. RESULTS: The results showed strong evidence for the association between FHS coverage and ACSH rates, including reductions of 22% in preventable hospitalizations and 15% in hospital expenses that were directly linked to the 40% increase in FHS population coverage during the evaluated period. This expansion of primary care has mainly benefitted areas that are difficult to access and populations that were previously deprived of health care in the vast Amazon territory. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study show that the increase of the expansion of primary care reduces the preventable hospitalization and the hospital expenses. This reinforces the need for public protection of the health of populations at risk and the positive impacts of primary care in the Brazilian Amazon.","Campelo Barroso Carneiro, Vânia Cristina; Ribeiro de Oliveira, Paulo de Tarso; Rassy Carneiro, Saul; Cardoso Maciel, Marinalva; da Silva Pedroso, Janari",PLoS One,3,22

The study aimed to explore the knowledge, perspectives and practices of physicians regarding various aspects of antibiotic stewardship program including antibiotic stewardship activities, rational use of antibiotics, antibiotic resistance, prescribing practices and factors associated with these practices. METHODS: In this qualitative study, a total of 17 semi-structured, in-depth interviews with doctors of three tertiary care public sector hospitals in Bahawalpur and Rahim Yar Khan were conducted. The convenient sampling method was adopted to collect the data and the saturation point criterion was applied to determine the sample size. Thematic analysis approach was used to draw conclusions from the data. RESULTS: The analysis of data yielded five themes, 12 subthemes and 26 categories. The themes included, (i) perception about antibiotic use and antibiotic stewardship, (ii) antibiotic prescription practices, (iii) antibiotic resistance, (iv) limited strategies adopted by hospital administration to ensure quality and safe distribution of antibiotics, (v) implementation of antibiotic stewardship program: barriers, suggestion and future benefits. Doctors had misconceptions about the rational use of antibiotics. The perception regarding antibiotic stewardship programs was poor. Moreover, very few activities related to ASP existed. The participants gave many suggestions for successful implementation of ASP in order to reduce the burden of antibiotic resistance, including development of guidelines for the use of antibiotics, strict legislation regarding use of antibiotics, active participation of healthcare professionals and awareness program among general public about the use of antibiotics. CONCLUSION: This study concluded that poor knowledge of doctors regarding ASP, non-existence of antibiogram of hospital and lack of rules for the safe use of antibiotics were the main driving factors associated with irrational antibiotic prescription practices and development of AR.

Recently, sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC) scoring was developed as a new criterion for coagulopathy-associated sepsis. We aimed to evaluate the accuracy of the SIC score for predicting the prognosis of septic shock. We analyzed data from a multicenter observational study conducted from 2011 to 2013. We grouped the participants into those who did and did not use vasopressors, and compared the in-hospital mortality rates of SIC and non-SIC patients. Patients who needed vasopressors were considered to have septic shock. We performed survival analysis adjusted by factors independently associated with mortality. SIC developed in 66.4% of patients who used vasopressors and 42.2% of patients who did not. The in-hospital mortality difference between the SIC and non-SIC groups was statistically significant in those who needed vasopressors (35.8% vs 27.9%, p < 0.01). Cox regression analysis indicated that SIC was significantly correlated with mortality risk in patients who used vasopressors (hazard ratio [HR] 1.39; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.13–1.70; p < 0.01), but not in those who did not (HR 1.38; 95% CI 0.81–2.34; p = 0.23).

Simultaneously, the mesenchymal stem/stromal cell (MSC) secretome is osteoinductive, promoting scaffold colonization by cells, proliferation, and differentiation. The present paper combines 3D-printed PCL scaffolds with lyosecretome, a freeze-dried formulation of MSC secretome, containing proteins and extracellular vesicles (EVs). We designed a lyosecretome 3D-printed scaffold by two loading strategies: (i) MSC secretome adsorption on 3D-printed scaffold and (ii) coprinting of PCL with an alginate-based hydrogel containing MSC secretome (at two alginate concentrations, i.e., 6% or 10% w/v). A fast release of proteins and EVs (a burst of 75% after 30 min) was observed from scaffolds obtained by absorption loading, while coprinting of PCL and hydrogel, encapsulating lyosecretome, allowed a homogeneous loading of protein and EVs and a controlled slow release. For both loading modes, protein and EV release was governed by diffusion as revealed by the kinetic release study. The secretome’s diffusion is influenced by alginate, its concentration, or its cross-linking modes with protamine due to the higher steric hindrance of the polymer chains. Moreover, it is possible to further slow down protein and EV release by changing the scaffold shape from parallelepiped to cylindrical. In conclusion, it is possible to control the release kinetics of proteins and EVs by changing the composition of the alginate hydrogel, the scaffold’s shape, and hydrogel cross-linking. Such scaffold prototypes for bone regenerative medicine are now available for further testing of safety and efficacy.","Bari, Elia; Scocozza, Franca; Perteghella, Sara; Sorlini, Marzio; Auricchio, Ferdinando; Torre, Maria Luisa; Conti, Michele",Pharmaceutics,3,1

The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence and risk factors associated with LEA in diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a cross-sectional health facility-based study that recruited 315 diabetes individuals with foot ulcers from the diabetes center in Khartoum, Sudan. Direct interviewing of subjects was used to obtain data, using a standardized validated questionnaire. Chi-square and logistic regression analysis were used in data analysis. RESULTS: 69.5% of the diabetic participants were aged 50 years old or more, and 71.1% were males. Most of the subjects (48.2%) were diabetics for a duration of >10 years, while more than one third (37.5%) of them were diabetic for 5–10 years. The majority (89.5%) had type 2 DM, while only 10.5% were type 1 DM. Two hundred forty-five patients had a left lower foot ulcer; 55.1% of the patients' ulcers were present in the toes, while 21.6% were in the foot sole. The overall prevalence of lower limb amputation was 17.1%. Individuals with diabetes patients with LEA had a higher incidence of hypertension (P = 0.000), retinopathy (P = 0.000), nephropathy (P = 0.002), ulcer size >2.5 cm (P = 0.000), and neuropathy (P = 0.000) through Chi-square analysis. Furthermore, logistic regression analysis showed that amputation was significantly associated with retinopathy (P = 0.000), size of ulcer (P = 0.000), and neuropathy (P = 0.016). CONCLUSION: The overall prevalence of LEA was 17.1%. The primary risks factors associated with amputation were presence of neuropathy and ulcer size >2.5 cm. Presence of retinopathy predispose diabetic individuals to amputation. Amputation is associated with disability and psychological problems; therefore, there is an urgent need for more improvement in preventative measures and primary health care system in low resource setting country like Sudan in order to decrease diabetes complications, especially patient's education about diabetes management by primary care physicians.","Elkhider, Alaa Tag E.; Almobark, Ahmed O.; Badi, Safaa; Tahir, Hanan; Ramadan, Azza; Khalil, Abbas A.; Elshaikh, Elamin; Ahmed, Mohamed H.",J Family Med Prim Care,3,33

Awareness of prescription drug abuse has been increasing in the last two decades, and organizations such as the International Narcotics Control Board has predicted that, worldwide, prescription drug abuse may exceed the use of illicit drugs. Assessment of prescription drug abuse tackles an issue that is hidden by nature, which therefore requires a specific monitoring. The current best practice is to use multiple detection systems to assess prescription drug abuse by various populations in a timely, sensitive, and specific manner. In the early 2000's, we designed a method to detect and quantify doctor shopping for prescription drugs from the French National Health Data System, which is one of the world's largest claims database, and a first-class data source for pharmacoepidemiological studies. Doctor shopping is a well-known behavior that involves overlapping prescriptions from multiple prescribers for the same drug, to obtain higher doses than those prescribed by each prescriber on an individual basis. In addition, doctor shopping may play an important role in supplying the black market. The paper aims to review how doctor shopping monitoring can improve the early detection of prescription drug abuse within a multidimensional monitoring. The paper provides an in-depth overview of two decades of development and validation of the method as a complementary component of the multidimensional monitoring conducted by the French Addictovigilance Network. The process accounted for the relevant determinants of prescription drug abuse, such as pharmacological data (e.g., formulations and doses), chronological and geographical data (e.g., impact of measures and comparison between regions), and epidemiological and outcome data (e.g., profiles of patients and trajectories of care) for several pharmacological classes (e.g., opioids, benzodiazepines, antidepressants, and methylphenidate).","Soeiro, Thomas; Lacroix, Clémence; Pradel, Vincent; Lapeyre-Mestre, Maryse; Micallef, Joëlle",Front Psychiatry,3,1

DESIGN: Nationwide population-based cohort study. SETTING: The study used anonymised primary care data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink and linked Hospital Episode Statistics secondary care data. PARTICIPANTS: Pregnant women eligible for pertussis (2012–2015, n=68 090) or influenza (2010/2011–2015/2016, n=152 132) vaccination in England. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Influenza and pertussis vaccine uptake. RESULTS: Vaccine uptake was 67.3% for pertussis and 39.1% for influenza. Uptake of both vaccines varied by region, with the lowest uptakes in London and the North East. Lower vaccine uptake was associated with greater deprivation: almost 10% lower in the most deprived quintiles compared with the least deprived for influenza (34.5% vs 44.0%), and almost 20% lower for pertussis (57.7% vs 76.0%). Lower uptake for both vaccines was also associated with non-white ethnicity (lowest among women of black ethnicity), maternal age under 20 years and a greater number of children in the household. The associations between all social factors and vaccine uptake were broadly unchanged in fully adjusted models, suggesting the social determinants of uptake were largely independent of one another. Among 3111 women vaccinated against pertussis in their first eligible pregnancy and pregnant again, 1234 (40%) were not vaccinated in their second eligible pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: Targeting promotional campaigns to pregnant women who are younger, of non-white ethnicity, with more children, living in areas of greater deprivation or the London or North East regions, has potential to reduce vaccine-preventable disease among infants and pregnant women, and to reduce health inequalities. Vaccination promotion needs to be sustained across successive pregnancies.

Herein, we present a case of delayed tracheal extubation after cardiac surgery due to cardiogenic auto-triggering. CASE PRESENTATION: A 73-year-old male with chronic constrictive pericarditis underwent radical pericardiectomy. After confirming hemodynamic stability, we conducted spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) with a flow-trigger sensitivity of 1 L/min. As his respiratory rate (RR) increased to more than 60 breaths/min and tidal volume decreased to less than 100 mL, this SBT was considered a failure. Next morning, SBT was reperformed and the result was unchanged. However, we noticed that his heart rate and RR were the same and suspected auto-triggering caused by cardiogenic oscillations. We changed ventilator mode from flow triggering to pressure triggering of −2 cmH(2)O and he was uneventfully extubated. CONCLUSION: We experienced a case of delayed tracheal extubation after cardiac surgery due to cardiogenic auto-triggering. Auto-triggering can be reduced by changing ventilator trigger mode.","Takekawa, Daiki; Uchida, Satoshi; Hirota, Kazuyoshi",JA Clin Rep,3,17

In the past few decades, the rise of reperfusion therapy has significantly reduced the mortality rate, but the MI diagnosis is still by means of the identification of myocardial injury markers without highly specific biomarkers of microcirculation disorders. Ferroptosis is a novel reported type of programmed cell death, which plays an important role in cancer development. Maintaining iron homeostasis in cells is essential for heart function, and its role in the pathological process of ischemic organ damages remains unclear. Being quickly detected through blood tests, circulating endothelial cells (CECs) have the potential for early judgment of early microcirculation disorders. In order to explore the role of ferroptosis-related genes in the early diagnosis of acute MI, we relied on two data sets from the GEO database to first detect eight ferroptosis-related genes differentially expressed in CECs between the MI and healthy groups in this study. After comparing different supervised learning algorithms, we constructed a random forest diagnosis model for acute MI based on these ferroptosis-related genes with a compelling diagnostic performance in both the validation (AUC = 0.8550) and test set (AUC = 0.7308), respectively. These results suggest that the ferroptosis-related genes might play an important role in the early stage of MI and have the potential as specific diagnostic biomarkers for MI.","Yifan, Chen; Jianfeng, Shi; Jun, Pu",Front Cardiovasc Med,3,1

Vitamin D(3) can reduce morbidity and mortality in these patients via different mechanisms. Lung inflammation is an important event in the initiation and development of respiratory disorders. However, the anti-inflammatory effects of vitamin D(3) and the underlying mechanisms remained to be determined. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects and mechanisms of action of vitamin D(3) (Vit. D) on the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) in vitro and in vivo with or without tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) treatment. Pretreatment with Vit. D reduced the expression of ICAM-1 and leukocyte adhesion in TNF-α-treated A549 cells. TNF-α increased the accumulation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS), while Vit. D reduced this effect. Pretreatment with Vit. D attenuated TNF-α-induced mitochondrial fission, as shown by the increased expression of mitochondrial fission factor (Mff), phosphorylated dynamin-related protein 1 (p-DRP1), and mitophagy-related proteins (BCL2/adenovirus E1B 19 kDa protein-interacting protein 3, Bnip3) in A549 cells. Inhibition of DRP1 or Mff significantly decreased ICAM-1 expression. In addition, we found that Vit. D decreased TNF-α-induced ICAM-1 expression, mitochondrial fission, and mitophagy via the AKT and NF-κB pathways. Moreover, ICAM-1 expression, mitochondrial fission, and mitophagy were increased in the lung tissues of TNF-α-treated mice, while Vit. D supplementation reduced these effects. In this study, we elucidated the mechanisms by which Vit. D reduces the expression of adhesion molecules in models of airway inflammation. Vit. D might be served as a novel therapeutic agent for the targeting of epithelial activation in lung inflammation. [Image: see text] Graphical Headlights: • The expression of DRP1 and Mff, mitochondrial fission-related proteins, was increased in TNF-α-treated A549 cells. • The expression of Bnip3 and LC3B, mitophagy-related proteins, was increased in TNF-α-treated A549 cells. • Vit. D pretreatment decreased TNF-α-induced inflammation through the reduction of mitochondrial fission and mitophagy in A549 cells.

These technologies facilitate the assessment of the genetic diversity in intra-host virus populations, which affects transmission, virulence and pathogenesis of viral infections. However, there are two major challenges in analysing viral diversity. First, amplification and sequencing errors confound the identification of true biological variants, and second, the large data volumes represent computational limitations. RESULTS: To support viral high-throughput sequencing studies, we developed V-pipe, a bioinformatics pipeline combining various state-of-the-art statistical models and computational tools for automated end-to-end analyses of raw sequencing reads. V-pipe supports quality control, read mapping and alignment, low-frequency mutation calling, and inference of viral haplotypes. For generating high-quality read alignments, we developed a novel method, called ngshmmalign, based on profile hidden Markov models and tailored to small and highly diverse viral genomes. V-pipe also includes benchmarking functionality providing a standardized environment for comparative evaluations of different pipeline configurations. We demonstrate this capability by assessing the impact of three different read aligners (Bowtie 2, BWA MEM, ngshmmalign) and two different variant callers (LoFreq, ShoRAH) on the performance of calling single-nucleotide variants in intra-host virus populations. V-pipe supports various pipeline configurations and is implemented in a modular fashion to facilitate adaptations to the continuously changing technology landscape.

Interestingly, there is unexplained variability in the relationship between satisfaction and appearance. OBJECTIVE: This qualitative study protocol aims to explore and better understand the satisfaction with appearance and function in a Canadian population with maxillary anterior single-tooth implants treated at a postgraduate university clinic. Thus, we aim to obtain diversity among participants relating to the identification of esthetically pleasing and displeasing cases from a clinician perspective. METHODS: A qualitative research design using interpretative phenomenology analysis (IPA) will provide an adaptable inductive research approach. The participants will be recruited, and consent documents, photographs, digital intraoral scans, and self-administered questionnaire responses will be obtained from them. The transcribed verbatim data from audio-recorded, in-depth, semistructured, one-to-one interviews of the participants will be managed, coded, and analyzed thematically with computer-assisted qualitative data analysis software. The IPA will consider the COnsolidated criteria for REporting Qualitative (COREQ) guidelines when applicable. RESULTS: For the qualitative interview, we plan to include at least eight patients to conduct up to 1.5 hours of open-ended interviews with each participant aided by an interview guide. Ethical approval was granted by the University of British Columbia Behavioral Research Ethics Board (H19-00107) in May 2019. Two American dental foundations funded this study. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis in this study will elucidate the aspects (including their value) that influence participant satisfaction at different dental implant treatment stages. This will be the first qualitative study on this group of the population to explore and obtain a better understanding of their satisfaction with appearance and function, as well as any other patient-reported outcome measures that could be identified.

To achieve these goals, the improvement of genetic tools for pre‐designed genome modifications is indispensable. The development of CRISPR/Cas nucleases allows the induction of site‐specific double‐strand breaks to enhance homologous recombination‐mediated gene targeting (GT). However, the efficiency of GT is still a challenging obstacle for many crops including tobacco. Recently, studies in several plant species indicated that by replacing SpCas9 with other CRISPR/Cas‐based nucleases, GT efficiencies might be enhanced considerably. Therefore, we tested SaCas9 as well as a temperature‐insensitive version of LbCas12a (ttLbCas12a) for targeting the tobacco SuRB gene. At the same time, we also optimized the protocol for Agrobacterium‐mediated tobacco transformation and tissue culture. In this way, we could improve GT efficiencies to up to a third of the inoculated cotyledons when using ttLbCas12a, which outperformed SaCas9 considerably. In addition, we could show that the conversion tract length of the GT reaction can be up to 606 bp long and in the majority of cases, it is longer than 250 bp. We obtained multiple heritable GT events, mostly heterozygous, but also biallelic GT events and some without T‐DNA integration. Thus, we were not only able to obtain CRISPR/Cas‐based heritable GT events in allotetraploid Nicotiana tabacum for the first time, but our results also indicate that ttLbCas12a might be a superior alternative for gene editing and GT in tobacco as well as in other crops.","Huang, Teng‐Kuei; Armstrong, Brittney; Schindele, Patrick; Puchta, Holger",Plant Biotechnol J,3,1

It is already known that phospholipases D, highly expressed toxins in Loxosceles venom, can induce most of these injuries. However, this spider venom has a great range of toxins that probably act synergistically to enhance toxicity. The other protein classes remain poorly explored due to the difficulty in obtaining sufficient amounts of them for a thorough investigation. They include astacins (metalloproteases), serine proteases, knottins, translationally controlled tumor proteins (TCTP), hyaluronidases, allergens and serpins. It has already been shown that some of them, according to their characteristics, may participate to some extent in the development of loxoscelism.

However, the therapeutic effects of hormone replacement therapy on postmenopausal women with neurodegenerative diseases remain controversial.

Estrogen and progesterone are two steroid hormones which decline in circulation and the brain during menopause. Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), which plays an import role in neuroprotection, is rapidly decreased in serum after menopause. Here, we summarize the actions of estrogen, progesterone, and IGF-1 and their signaling pathways in the brain. Since the incidence of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is higher in women than in men, the associations of steroid hormone changes and AD are emphasized. The signaling pathways and cellular mechanisms for how steroid hormones and IGF-1 provide neuroprotection are also addressed. Finally, the molecular mechanisms of potential estrogen modulation on N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptors (NMDARs) are also addressed. We provide the viewpoint of why hormone therapy has inconclusive results based on signaling pathways considering their complex response to aging and hormone treatments. Nonetheless, while diagnosable AD may not be treatable by hormone therapy, its preceding stage of mild cognitive impairment may very well be treatable by hormone therapy.","Cheng, Yu-Jung; Lin, Chieh-Hsin; Lane, Hsien-Yuan",Int J Mol Sci,3,1

CKD-related CV disease pathogenic mechanisms are not only associated with traditional factors such as arterial hypertension and dyslipidemia, but also with ED, oxidative stress and low-grade inflammation. The typical comorbidities of CKD contribute to reduce the performance and the levels of the physical activity in nephropathic patients compared to healthy subjects. Currently, the effective role of physical activity on ED is still debated, but the available few literature data suggest its positive contribution. Another possible adjuvant treatment of ED in CKD patients is represented by natural bioactive compounds (NBCs). Among these, minor polar compounds of extra virgin olive oil (hydroxytyrosol, tyrosol and oleocanthal), polyphenols, and vitamin D seem to exert a beneficial role on ED in CKD patients.

We aimed to explore whether ARDS phenotypes can be identified using clinical data, are reproducible and are associated with clinical outcomes and treatment response. METHODS: This study is based on a retrospective analysis of data from the telehealth intensive care unit (eICU) collaborative research database and three ARDS randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (ALVEOLI, FACTT and SAILS trials). We derived phenotypes in the eICU by cluster analysis based on clinical data and compared the clinical characteristics and outcomes of each phenotype. The reproducibility of the derived phenotypes was tested using the data from three RCTs, and treatment effects were evaluated. RESULTS: Three clinical phenotypes were identified in the training cohort of 3875 ARDS patients. Of the three phenotypes identified, phenotype I (n = 1565; 40%) was associated with fewer laboratory abnormalities, less organ dysfunction and the lowest in-hospital mortality rate (8%). Phenotype II (n = 1232; 32%) was correlated with more inflammation and shock and had a higher mortality rate (18%). Phenotype III (n = 1078; 28%) was strongly correlated with renal dysfunction and acidosis and had the highest mortality rate (22%). These results were validated using the data from the validation cohort (n = 3670) and three RCTs (n = 2289) and had reproducibility. Patients with these ARDS phenotypes had different treatment responses to randomized interventions. Specifically, in the ALVEOLI cohort, the effects of ventilation strategy (high PEEP vs low PEEP) on ventilator-free days differed by phenotype (p = 0.001); in the FACTT cohort, there was a significant interaction between phenotype and fluid-management strategy for 60-day mortality (p = 0.01). The fluid-conservative strategy was associated with improved mortality in phenotype II but had the opposite effect in phenotype III. CONCLUSION: Three clinical phenotypes of ARDS were identified and had different clinical characteristics and outcomes. The analysis shows evidence of a phenotype-specific treatment benefit in the ALVEOLI and FACTT trials. These findings may improve the identification of distinct subsets of ARDS patients for exploration in future RCTs.

TLRs play a vital role in anticancer immunity and the regulation of the biological progress of tumour cells. However, the precise role of TLRs in KIRC is still ambiguous. METHODS: Various bioinformatics analysis and clinical validation of tissues were performed to evaluate the prognostic value of TLRs and their correlation with immune infiltration in KIRC. RESULTS: The expression of TLR2/3/7/8 was increased at both mRNA and protein levels in KIRC. TLRs in KIRC were involved in the activation of apoptosis, EMT, RAS/MAPK, and RTK pathways, as well as the inhibition of the cell cycle and the hormone AR pathway. Drug sensitivity analysis revealed that high expression of TLR3 and low expression of TLR7/9/10 were resistant to most of the small molecules or drugs from CTRP. Enrichment analyses showed that TLRs were mainly involved in innate immune response, toll-like receptor signalling pathway, NF-kappa B signalling pathway, and TNF signalling pathway. Furthermore, a high-level TLR3 expression was associated with a favourable prognosis in KIRC. Validation research further confirmed that TLR3 expression was increased in KIRC tissues, and high TLR3 levels were associated with poor overall survival. Moreover, TLR3 in KIRC showed a positive association with an abundance of immune cells, including B-cells, CD4+ T-cells, CD8+ T-cells, macrophage, neutrophils, and dendritic cells, and the expression of the immune biomarker sets. Several TLR3-associated kinase, miRNA, or transcription factor targets were also identified in KIRC. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that TLR3 serves as a prognostic biomarker and associated with immune infiltration in KIRC.

Logistic regression models estimated the probability of past-year heterosexual activity among adults in three national health surveys, by sex, age group, race and ethnicity, education category, and marital status. Model-based probabilities were applied to estimated counts of HAAs by state, which were synthesized through meta-analysis. HIV diagnoses were overlaid to calculate racial- and ethnic-specific rates, rate differences (RDs), and rate ratios (RRs) among HAAs by sex and state. RESULTS: Nationally, HAA women have a two-fold higher HIV diagnosis rate than HAA men (rate per 100,000 HAAs, women: 6.57; men: 3.09). Compared to White non-Hispanic HAAs, Black HAAs have a 20-fold higher HIV diagnosis rate (RR, men: 21.28, women: 19.55; RD, men: 15.40, women: 31.78) and Hispanic HAAs have a 4-fold higher HIV diagnosis rate (RR, men: 4.68, RD, women: 4.15; RD, men: 2.79, RD, women: 5.39). Disparities were ubiquitous across regions, with >75% of states in each region having Black-to-White RR ≥10. CONCLUSION: The racial and ethnic disparities across regions suggests a system-wide failure particularly with respect to preventing HIV among Black and Hispanic women. Pervasive disparities emphasize the role for coordinated federal responses such as the current Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) initiative.","Martin, Erika G.; Ansari, Bahareh; Hart-Malloy, Rachel; Smith, Dawn K.; Delaney, Kevin P.; Gift, Thomas L.; Berruti, Andrés A.; Trigg, Monica; Rosenberg, Eli S.",PLoS One,3,1

Challenges include availability of surgical providers, improving quality of care, and building workforce capacity. Despite growing evidence that mentoring is effective in African healthcare settings, less is known about its role in surgery. We examined a multimodal approach to mentorship as part of a safe surgery intervention (Safe Surgery 2020) to improve surgical quality. Our goal was to distill lessons for policy makers, intervention designers, and practitioners on key elements of a successful surgical mentorship program. METHODS: We used a convergent, mixed-methods design to examine the experiences of mentees, mentors, and facility leaders with mentorship at 10 health facilities in Tanzania’s Lake Zone. A multidisciplinary team of mentors worked with surgical providers over 17 months using in-person mentorship, telementoring, and WhatsApp. We conducted surveys, in-depth interviews, and focus groups to capture data in four categories: (1) satisfaction with mentorship; (2) perceived impact; (3) elements of a successful mentoring program; and (4) challenges to implementing mentorship. We analyzed quantitative data using frequency analysis and qualitative data using the constant comparison method. Recurrent and unifying concepts were identified through merging the qualitative and quantitative data. RESULTS: Overall, 96% of mentees experienced the intervention as positive, 88% were satisfied, and 100% supported continuing the intervention in the future. Mentees, mentors, and facility leaders perceived improvements in surgical practice, the surgical ecosystem, and in reducing postsurgical infections. Several themes related to the intervention’s success emerged: (1) the intervention’s design, including its multimodality, side-by-side mentorship, and standardization of practices; (2) the mentee–mentor relationship, including a friendly, safe, non-hierarchical, team relationship, as well as mentors’ understanding of the local context; and (3) mentorship characteristics, including non-judgmental feedback, experience, and accessibility. Challenges included resistance to change, shortage of providers, mentorship dose, and logistics. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests a multimodal mentorship approach is promising in building the capacity of surgical providers. By distilling the experiences of the mentees, mentors, and facility leaders, our lessons provide a foundation for future efforts to establish effective surgical mentorship programs that build provider capacity and ultimately improve surgical quality.

The main objectives of the current study were the following: (1) translate and cross-culturally adapt the FOUR score into Greek; (2) evaluate its clinimetric properties, including interrater reliability, internal consistency, and construct validity; and (3) evaluate the reliability of assessments among health care professionals with different levels of experience and training. METHODS: The FOUR score was initially translated into Greek. Next, patients with neurosurgical pathologies in need of consciousness monitoring were independently assessed with the GCS and FOUR score within one hour by four raters who had different levels of experience and training (two board-certified neurosurgeons, a neurosurgery resident, and a registered nurse). Interrater reliability, internal consistency, and construct validity were evaluated for the scales using weighted Cohen’s κ (κ(w)) and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), Cronbach’s α and Spearman’s ρ values, respectively. RESULTS: A total of 408 assessments were performed for 99 patients. The interrater reliability was excellent for both the FOUR score (ICC = 0.941) and GCS (ICC = 0.936). The values of κ(w) exceeded 0.90 for all pairs, suggesting that the FOUR score can be reliably applied by raters with varying experience. Among the scales’ components, FOUR score’s brainstem and respiratory items showed the lowest, yet high enough (κ(w) > 0.60), level of agreement. The interrater reliability remained excellent (κ(w) > 0.85, ICC > 0.90) for all diagnosis and age groups, with a trend toward higher FOUR score values in the most severe cases (ICC = 0.813 vs. 0.723). Both the FOUR score and GCS showed high internal consistency (Cronbach’s α > 0.70 for all occasions). The FOUR score correlated strongly with GCS (Spearman’s ρ > 0.90 for all raters), suggesting high construct validity. CONCLUSIONS: The Greek version of the FOUR score is a valid and reliable tool for the clinical assessment of patients with disorders of consciousness. It can be applied successfully by nurses, residents, and specialized physicians. Therefore, its use by medical practitioners with different levels of experience and training is strongly encouraged.

PU foam was synthesized using polyethylene glycol, glycerol, NL, and 1, 6-diisocyanato-hexane (NCO/OH ratio: 1.2) and water as blowing agent. The resultant foam was immersed in ethanolic extract of propolis (EEP). PU, NL-PU, and PU-NL/EEP foams were characterized from mechanical, morphological, and chemical perspectives. NL Incorporation into PU increased mechanical strength, while EEP coating showed lower strength than PU-NL/EEP. Morphological investigations confirmed an open-celled structure with a pore diameter of 150–200 μm, a density of nearly 0.2 g/cm(3,), and porosity greater than 85%, which led to significantly high water absorption (267% for PU-NL/EEP). The hydrophilic nature of foams, measured by the contact angle, proved to be increased by NL addition and EEP coating. PU and PU-NL did not show important antibacterial features, while EEP coating resulted in a significant antibacterial efficiency. All foams revealed high biocompatibility toward L929 fibroblasts, with the highest cell viability and cell attachment for PU-NL/EEP. In vivo wound healing using Wistar rats’ full-thickness skin wound model confirmed that PU-NL/EEP exhibited an essentially higher wound healing efficacy compared with other foams. Hence, PU-NL/EEP foam could be a promising wound dressing candidate.","Pahlevanneshan, Zari; Deypour, Mohammadreza; Kefayat, Amirhosein; Rafienia, Mohammad; Sajkiewicz, Paweł; Esmaeely Neisiany, Rasoul; Enayati, Mohammad Saeid",Polymers (Basel),3,8

Previous studies have shown that comorbidity can impact on the short-term and long-term mortality after stroke. METHODS: Our study aimed to explore the trend of comorbidity among patients with first stroke from 2010 to 2020, and the influence of comorbidity on admission mortality, length of stay and hospitalization costs. 5988 eligible patients were enrolled in our study, and divided into 4 comorbidity burden groups according to Charlson comorbidity index (CCI): none, moderate, severe, very severe. Survival analysis was expressed by Kaplan–Meier curve. Cox regression model was used to analyze the effect of comorbidity on 7-day and in-hospital mortality. Generalized linear model (GLM) was used to analyze the association between comorbidity and hospitalization days and cost. RESULTS: Compared to patients without comorbidity, those with very severe comorbidity were more likely to be male (342, 57.7%), suffer from ischemic stroke (565, 95.3%), afford higher expense (Midian, 19339.3RMB, IQR13020.7–27485.9RMB), and have a higher in-hospital mortality (60, 10.1%). From 2010 to 2020, proportion of patients with severe and very severe comorbidity increased 12.9%. The heaviest comorbidity burden increased the risk of 7-day mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 3.51, 95% CI 2.22–5.53) and in-hospital mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 3.83, 95% CI 2.70–5.45). Patients with very severe comorbidity had a 12% longer LOS and extra 27% expense than those without comorbidity. CONCLUSIONS: Comorbidity burden showed an increasing trend year in past eleven years. The heavy comorbidity burden increased in-hospital mortality, LOS, and hospitalization cost, especially in patients aged 55 years or more. The findings also provide some reference on improvement of health care reform policies and allocation of resources.

A brief overview,14.001885,8.099048,2021-09-10,"BACKGROUND: In pediatric cardiac surgery, perioperative management has evolved from slow weaning of mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit to “ultra‐fast‐track” anesthesia with early extubation (EE) in theater to promote a faster recovery. The strategy of EE has not been assessed in adults with congenital heart disease, a growing population of patients who often require surgery. METHODS AND RESULTS: Data were collected retrospectively on all patients >16 years of age who underwent adult congenital heart surgery in our tertiary center between December 2012 and January 2020. Coarsened exact matching was performed for relevant baseline variables. Overall, 711 procedures were performed: 133 (18.7%) patients underwent EE and 578 (81.3%) patients received conventional extubation. After matching, patients who received EE required less inotropic or vasopressor support in the early postoperative period (median Vasoactive‐inotropic score 0.5 [0.0–2.0] versus 2.0 [0.0–3.5]; P<0.0001) and had a lower total net fluid balance than patients after conventional extubation (1168±723 versus 847±733 mL; P=0.0002). The overall reintubation rate was low at 0.3%. EE was associated with a significantly shorter postoperative length of stay in higher dependency care units before a “step‐down” to ward‐based care (48 [45–50] versus 50 [47–69] hours; P=0.004). Lower combined intensive care unit and high dependency unit costs were incurred by patients who received EE compared with patients who received conventional extubation (£3949 [3430–4222] versus £4166 [3893–5603]; P<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: In adult patients undergoing surgery for congenital heart disease, EE is associated with a reduced need for postoperative hemodynamic support, a shorter intensive care unit stay, and lower health‐care‐related costs.","Bianchi, Paolo; Constantine, Andrew; Costola, Giulia; Mele, Sara; Shore, Darryl; Dimopoulos, Konstantinos; Aw, Tuan‐Chen",J Am Heart Assoc,3,1

Hydrostatic and non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema, as well as transfusion-related lung injury, may cause bilateral airspace opacification that may be confused with an infectious process. Chemotherapeutic agents, whether administered for treatment of an underlying hematologic malignancy, for induction prior to transplant, or for the treatment of GVHD or graft rejection after transplant, may cause lung injury that in some cases may not become apparent until years later. Radiation-induced lung injury may cause a distinct pattern of lung injury, which may present months after exposure. In hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients, pulmonary diagnoses such as engraftment syndrome, idiopathic pneumonia syndrome, and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage can mimic pneumonia. After lung transplantation, infiltrates may be seen as a consequence of primary graft dysfunction or allograft rejection. Organizing pneumonia may be seen both in recipients of solid organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplants. Organizing pneumonia may be cryptogenic or associated with the use of the mTOR inhibitor sirolimus.

They are easy to detect and often to isolate. In addition, many are available from commercial suppliers. They are now obtainable also by recombinant techniques. The classic, and still simplest, way to detect the presence of a lectin in a biological material is to prepare an extract from the material and examine its ability to agglutinate erythrocytes (Fig. 3.1) (Rüdiger, 1993). A more refined screening procedure is based on the ability of these proteins to precipitate polysaccharides (Goldstein, 1976) (Fig. 3.2) or glycoproteins. If a positive result is obtained, it is essential to show that the agglutination or precipitation is specifically inhibited by mono- or oligosaccharides, i.e., it is sugar specific (Fig. 3.1). Hemagglutination is commonly assayed by the serial dilution technique using erythrocytes from humans or rabbits. Occasionally erythrocytes that have been treated with trypsin or sialidase are employed, since such cells are often more sensitive to agglutination than the untreated cells (Fig. 3.3). Hemagglutination also serves to monitor and quantify the activity of lectins in the course of purification. Because of the wide use of the agglutination reaction, it deserves some comments (Lis & Sharon, 1986). For agglutination to occur, the lectin must bind to the cells and form cross-bridges between them. There is however no simple relation between the amount of lectin bound and agglutination. Cases are even known where considerable amounts of lectin are bound to cells, without causing agglutination. This is because agglutination is affected by many factors, among them accessibility of receptor sites, membrane fluidity and metabolic state of the cells. It is also influenced by external conditions of the assay, such as temperature, cell concentration, mixing and so on. The relative contribution of the different factors depends on both the lectin and the cells examined. When agglutination does occur and it is inhibited by monoor oligosaccharides, it serves as an indication that carbohydrate structures for which the lectin is specific are present on the surface of the cell. Additional information on the nature of the receptors may be obtained with erythrocytes pretreated with enzymes, in particular glycosidases, or with sugar-modifying reagents, such as periodate. Agglutination with lectins is also of use in following changes on cell surfaces during physiological and pathological processes.",,Lectins,3,1

A new model is proposed using 2-D cellular automata (CA), which extends the traditional definition of CA and establishes whole transition rules for malware propagation in WSN. Meanwhile, the validations of the model are proved through theoretical analysis and simulations. The theoretical analysis yields closed-form expressions which show good agreement with the simulation results of the proposed model. It is shown that the malware propaga-tion in WSN unfolds neighborhood saturation, which dominates the effects of increasing infectivity and limits the spread of the malware. MAC mechanism of wireless sensor networks greatly slows down the speed of malware propagation and reduces the risk of large-scale malware prevalence in these networks. The proposed model can describe accurately the dynamic behavior of malware propagation over WSN, which can be applied in developing robust and efficient defense system on WSN.","Song, Yurong; Jiang, Guo-Ping",Complex Sciences,3,17

FIV was first described in 1987 by Niels Pedersen and co-workers as the causative agent for a fatal immunodeficiency syndrome observed in cats housed in a cattery in Petaluma, California. Since this landmark observation, multiple studies have shown that natural and experimental infection of cats with biological isolates of FIV produces an AIDS syndrome very similar in pathogenesis to that observed for human AIDS. FIV infection induces an acute viremia associated with Tcell alterations including depressed CD4 :CD8 T-cell ratios and CD4 T-cell depletion, peripheral lymphadenopathy, and neutropenia. In later stages of FIV infection, the host suffers from chronic persistent infections that are typically self-limiting in an immunocompetent host, as well as opportunistic infections, chronic diarrhea and wasting, blood dyscracias, significant CD4 T-cell depletion, neurologic disorders, and B-cell lymphomas. Importantly, chronic FIV infection induces a progressive lymphoid and CD4 T-cell depletion in the infected cat. The primary mode of natural FIV transmission appears to be blood-borne facilitated by fighting and biting. However, experimental infection through transmucosal routes (rectal and vaginal mucosa and perinatal) have been well documented for specific FIV isolates. Accordingly, FIV disease pathogenesis exhibits striking similarities to that described for HIV-1 infection.","Sparger, Ellen E.",In vivo Models of HIV Disease and Control,3,1

Subsequent global expansion of dengue infection outbreaks has occurred, with millions of cases yearly, probably from a combination of factors including proliferation of international travel and trade, possibly global climate changes, adaptation of the vectors to new environment, and emergence of a new mosquito vector, Aedes albopictus. Chikungunya virus, also transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, causes a very similar clinical disease but with more prominent arthralgia or arthritis and was originally described in Africa in the 1960s. After a quiescent period of several decades, it reemerged in Africa in 2004 and rapidly spread across the Indian Ocean to involve Asian countries and parts of Europe. However, the past 2 years have seen the emergence of chikungunya virus in the western hemisphere with major outbreaks in the Caribbean and the Americas. Similar to dengue virus, chikungunya virus has adapted to Ae. albopictus mosquitoes which can transmit the disease. Although dengue infection is a more deadly disease especially in young children, chikungunya infection can cause prolonged severe disability and occasionally rare fatalities from encephalitis. No specific treatment is available for either diseases, but development of an effective vaccine for dengue infection is in progress. Until 2007, Zika virus [also transmitted by Aedes species] was associated with only sporadic mild infections in Africa and Asia. In 2007, Zika virus for the first time caused an outbreak beyond Africa and Asia to the Yap Island in the Federated States of Micronesia. Since then Zika virus has spread to French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Cook Islands, and Easter Island in the southeastern Pacific Ocean [Chile] in 2014 and by 2015 to Brazil. By January 2016, it became evident that Zika virus had caused an explosive outbreak in the Americas and the Caribbean with over 30 countries affected. On February 1, 2016, the World Health Organization declared Zika outbreak a global public health emergency. Zika virus infection is most commonly asymptomatic, and 20% of patients may develop a mild viral disease, but of major concern is the reported association of microcephaly in infected pregnant women in Brazil.

PEDV infection causes acute diarrhea/vomiting, dehydration, and high morbidity and mortality in seronegative neonatal piglets. In this chapter, materials and methods for performing immunohistochemistry (IHC) for the detection of PEDV antigens in frozen or formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues are provided. In IHC of frozen tissues where viral antigens are well preserved, the use of specific antibodies labeled with fluorescence dyes provides excellent advantages and convenience, resulting in high sensitivity and specificity of IHC and reduction of operation time. In IHC of FFPE tissues where tissue or cell morphology is well preserved, the use of specific antibodies labeled with enzymes, such as alkaline phosphatase, also gives rise to significant advantages in defining the correlation of viral antigens with histopathologic lesions. PEDV antigens in frozen tissues are visualized as green staining in the cytoplasm of infected cells by fluorescent dyes conjugated with antibodies when activated by exciting light of a specific wavelength under a fluorescence microscope. In FFPE tissues, PEDV antigens are visualized as red staining in the cytoplasm of infected cells by the deposition of the substrate chromogen, Fast Red.","Jung, Kwonil",Animal Coronaviruses,3,1

Human astroviruses are recognized as the second leading cause of childhood viral gastroenteritis worldwide. Eight traditional astrovirus serotypes have been identified in humans, but recently novel astrovirus strains isolated from humans have been associated with diseases other than gastroenteritis. Herein we summarize our current knowledge of the astrovirus life cycle. Though there are gaps in our understanding of astrovirus replication, similarities can be drawn from Picornaviridae and Caliciviridae virus families. There are, however, unique characteristics of the astrovirus life cycle, including intracellular proteolytic processing of viral particles by cellular caspases, which has been shown to be required for the maturation and exit of viral progeny.","Méndez, Ernesto; Murillo, Andrea; Velázquez, Rodrigo; Burnham, Andrew; Arias, Carlos F.",Astrovirus Research,3,17

The awareness of the rising medical threat represented by the opportunistic fungal infections among the health care-associated infections, the advances in the knowledge of fungal pathogenicity and immune response and the extraordinary progress of biotechnology have generated enthusiasm and critical new tools for active and passive anti-fungal vaccination. The discovery that antibodies play a critical role for protection against fungal infection has greatly contributed to the advancements in this field, in recognition that almost all useful vaccines against viral and bacterial pathogens owe their protective efficacy to neutralizing, opsonizing or otherwise effective antibodies. Overall, there is more hope now than few years ago about the chances of generating and having approved by the regulatory authorities one or more antifungal vaccines, be active or passive, for use in humans in the next few years. In particular, the possibility of protecting against multiple opportunistic mycoses in immuno-depressed subjects with a single, well-defined glucan-conjugate vaccine eliciting directly anti-fungal antibodies may be an important step to achieve this public health goal","Cassone, Antonio MD",Immunology of Fungal Infections,3,1

This presents considerable challenges to our health care system since advanced age is associated with a higher susceptibility to infectious diseases due to immune senescence. However, the mechanisms underlying age-associated dysregulated immunity are still incompletely understood. Advancement in our comprehension of mechanisms of immune senescence and development of interventions to improve health span requires animal models that closely recapitulate the physiological changes that occur with aging in humans. Nonhuman primates (NHPs) are invaluable preclinical models to study the underlying causal mechanism of pathogenesis due to their outbred nature, high degree of genetic and physiological similarity to humans, and their susceptibility to human pathogens. In this chapter, we review NHP models available for biogerontology research, advantages and challenges they present, and advances they facilitated. Furthermore, we emphasize the utility of NHPs in characterizing immune senescence, evaluating interventions to reverse aging of the immune system, and development of vaccine strategies that are better suited for this vulnerable population.","Rivera, Andrea; Rais, Maham; Barr, Tasha; Arnold, Nicole; Sureshchandra, Suhas; Messaoudi, Ilhem",Handbook of Immunosenescence,3,1

This includes the “core” set of commensal viruses that do not give rise to clinical symptoms or viremia, combined with any acute or persistent infections that may be present. Recent technological advances enable us to sequence viral genomes without culturing or cloning. These methods permit not only the discovery of a wider range of viral pathogens, but also a broader assessment of the human virome in the absence of clinically recognized disease. A new focus in contemporary virology is the natural viral community of the human body. This will provide a background for recognition of emerging and previously unrecognized viruses. It should be possible to detect viral infection before the emergence of symptoms, which will have significant implications for health-care delivery.","Haynes, Matthew; Rohwer, Forest",Metagenomics of the Human Body,3,1

Today, due to the great advances in fields such as immunology and bioengineering, the rational development of live attenuated vaccines becomes increasingly feasible. Moreover, live vaccines can be used as carrier systems for heterologous antigens or therapeutic factors. In each case, the development of a recombinant live attenuated vaccine is a complex task where properties such as targeting specificity, antigen synthesis, antigen release, and safety aspects have to be integrated. A range of such recombinant vaccine candidates have successfully been tested in the clinics, but very few have been approved so far.

A colonization process is an important event where both the microbe and the host plant have been benefited. Microbes commonly established either epiphytic or endophytic mode of life cycle on phyllosphere environment, which helps the host plant and functional communication with the surrounding environment.

Wind tunnel test data was used to correlate the FAD understanding of the three zones with pedestrian-level wind environment. Linear regression analysis indicated that a lower urban podium zone yielded the best correlation with the experimental data, and 200 × 200 m was the reasonable resolution for the FAD map. This study further established that the simpler two-dimensional ground coverage ratio (GCR) that is readily available in the planning circle can be used to predict the area’s average pedestrian-level urban ventilation performance of the city.

It is about explaining the importance of work to grant panels, funding agencies, and project reviewers; publishing research; and informing and educating the public.

The ability to communicate effectively is not an innate quality that one either does or does not possess. It is a set of skills that can be learned and developed, regardless of one's starting point. While some people seem more naturally adept than others, through conscious effort, practice, and constructive feedback, everyone can improve. Being able to speak knowledgeably and fluently is important for effective communication, especially at the beginning of any conversation or presentation because it sets the tone, and can positively influence self-confidence. An important strategy for increasing preparedness and effectiveness as a communicator is to commit to the continual development of skills. Another way to influence how to communicate successfully is to understand the audience—the “receivers” of the message—and to use the information to make the best “connection.”","Szymanski, Christine",Success Strategies for Women in Science,3,19

Many virus diseases, both of humans and animals, have been successfully controlled by vaccines. These successes have naturally led to improvements in the spectrum and duration of protection offered by vaccines until, at present it is difficult to see how antiviral drugs could compete with vaccines in the control of many virus diseases. One may cite smallpox, yellow fever, polio, and recently measles among human diseases, Newcastle disease, Marek's disease, and infectious bronchitis among poultry diseases—an area of veterinary disease control where vaccines have been particularly important. Research into the treatment of virus diseases by drugs is at present directed toward three general areas: (1) attempts to stimulate the defense mechanism of the host animal, (2) large screening programs to find drugs which directly block some virus-specific process, and (3) alleviation of the symptoms of the disease. The treatment of the symptoms, rather than the cause of a disease, has been the mainstay of medical practice from time immemorial, and this is still the case with most virus disease. The short incubation period of many virus diseases will inevitably restrict the therapeutic use of antiviral drugs and in cases where symptoms have already appeared.","Bucknall, R.A.",Adv Pharmacol,3,1

Viruses, like other infectious agents, enter the animal body through one of its surfaces. They then spread either locally on one of the body surfaces or through lymphatic and blood vessels to produce systemic infection. To infect its host, a virus first attaches to and infects cells of one of the body surfaces: the skin, the mucosa of the digestive, respiratory, or urogenital tract, or the conjunctiva. Parenteral injection, either by needle or by the bite of an arthropod or vertebrate, bypasses the body surfaces. A lesion may be produced at the site of entry, although invasion may occur without the development of any local evidence of infection.

We have implemented, used and refined this system since 2009 for growing student numbers, and summarise the design and experience of using it. The core idea is to use a unit testing framework: the teacher creates a set of unit tests, and the student code is tested by running these tests. With our implementation, students typically submit work for assessment, and receive feedback by email within a few minutes after submission. The choice of tests and the reporting back to the student is chosen to optimise the educational value for the students. The system very significantly reduces the staff time required to establish whether a student’s solution is correct, and shifts the emphasis of computing laboratory student contact time from assessing correctness to providing guidance. The self-paced nature of the automatic feedback provision supports a student-centred learning approach. Students can re-submit their work repeatedly and iteratively improve their solution, and enjoy using the system. We include an evaluation of the system from using it in a class of 425 students.","Fangohr, Hans; O’Brien, Neil; Hovorka, Ondrej; Kluyver, Thomas; Hale, Nick; Prabhakar, Anil; Kashyap, Arti",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,3,11

We call these automata ‘good-for-MDPs’ (GFM). We show that GFM automata are closed under classic simulation as well as under more powerful simulation relations that leverage properties of optimal control strategies for MDPs. This closure enables us to exploit state-space reduction techniques, such as those based on direct and delayed simulation, that guarantee simulation equivalence. We demonstrate the promise of GFM automata by defining a new class of automata with favorable properties—they are Büchi automata with low branching degree obtained through a simple construction—and show that going beyond limit-deterministic automata may significantly benefit reinforcement learning.","Hahn, Ernst Moritz; Perez, Mateo; Schewe, Sven; Somenzi, Fabio; Trivedi, Ashutosh; Wojtczak, Dominik",Tools and Algorithms for the Construction and Analysis of Systems,3,1

This indicates that they might have an advantage over native bivalve filter feeders. Hence, at the scale of individual bivalves, we studied whether this advantage occurs in optimizing food intake over native bivalves. We investigated feeding current characteristics, in which potential differences may ultimately lead to a differential food intake. We compared feeding currents of the invasive epibenthic non-siphonate Pacific oyster to those of two native bivalve suspension feeders: the epibenthic siphonate blue mussel Mytilus edulis and the endobenthic siphonate common cockle Cerastoderma edule. Inhalant flow fields were studied empirically using digital particle image velocimetry and particle tracking velocimetry. Exhalant jet speeds were modelled for a range of exhalant-aperture cross-sectional areas as determined in the laboratory and a range of filtration rates derived from literature. Significant differences were found in inhalant and exhalant current velocities and properties of the inhalant flow field (acceleration and distance of influence). At comparable body weight, inhalant current velocities were lower in C. gigas than in the other species. Modelled exhalant jets were higher in C. gigas, but oriented horizontally instead of vertically as in the other species. Despite these significant differences and apparent morphological differences between the three species, absolute differences in feeding current characteristics were small and are not expected to lead to significant differences in feeding efficiency.","Troost, Karin; Stamhuis, Eize J.; van Duren, Luca A.; Wolff, Wim J.",Mar Biol,3,7

Evaluation of the perioperative renal function is substantial using novel biomarkers other than the late traditional method of using serum creatinine. Plasma neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) is a biomarker investigated for early detection of AKI in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting, and its role has to be determined in this study. RESULTS: Twenty-five patients undergoing elective CABG were enrolled in this cohort study and were assigned into two groups: group I include the patients that did not develop AKI (no AKI group) and group II include the patients that developed AKI (AKI group). Acute kidney injury based on Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) classification had been developed in 7 patients (28%). Plasma NGAL levels at 6 h were higher in patients who developed AKI compared with those who did not (302 ± 88.02 vs. 116.50 ± 17.33 ng/m, p value < 0.001). The cut-off value of plasma NGAL levels measured 6 h postoperatively was 145 ng/ml and the area under the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve was 0.965. Results of this study showed that plasma NGAL is a robust early biomarker of AKI, which preceded the rise in serum creatinine by many hours. CONCLUSION: This study revealed that earlier diagnosis of acute kidney injury in patients undergoing CABG can be achieved by measuring postoperative plasma NGAL concentration at 6 h.","Othman, Haitham Mohy El Din Mahmoud; Hassan, Alaa Eid Mohamed; Elsersi, Mayar Hassan; Soliman, Ahmed Kamal Mohamed Ali; Emam, Dalia Fahmy",Ain-Shams J Anesthesiol,3,11

Digital information exchange often involves health care workers; they are considered a credible source of health information. The purpose of this study was to delineate the attitudes of health care workers toward health information, determined by gender, educational attainment, and age differences. Health information in this study was information circulated on WhatsApp. We divided the age differences into four digital generations: baby boomers and Generations X, Y, and Z. We used the t-test and analysis of education and age differences when using the analysis of variance to demonstrate the differences among determinants factors of respondents—617 health care workers in West Java—in using WhatsApp when receiving and sharing health information. The results support that attitudes toward health information are determined by education attainment and differences in generation and that gender differences have no effect.","Dida, Susanne; Hafiar, Hanny; Kadiyono, Anissa Lestari; Lukman, Syauqy",Heliyon,3,24

Noise removal is an essential pre-processing for the noisy HSIs. Though denoising algorithms for common (grayscale or RGB) images have been studied for decades, HSIs have their inherent characteristics, so denoising algorithms for HSIs need to be specially designed. In this work, we have developed a non-local denoising algorithm for HSIs based on multi-task graph-regularized sparse nonnegative matrix factorization (MTGSNMF). MTGSNMF delivers noise removal in both spatial and spectral views. In spatial view, patch-based sparse recovery is performed by sparse nonnegative matrix factorization (SNMF), which conducts noise suppression and local pattern preservation. Graph regularization is imposed on the SNMF model for maintaining the non-local similarities between patches. In spectral view, spectral structure is extracted by multi-task learning, i.e., denoising tasks of different bands are bound by sharing the same coefficient matrix. By exploiting the non-local similarity in spatial view and spectral structure in spectral view, MTGSNMF achieves superior denoising performance on HSI datasets.","Lei, Ling; Huang, Binqian; Ye, Minchao; Chen, Hong; Qian, Yuntao",Geometry and Vision,3,1

Biological targets have multiple peculiarities that add to the challenges of the SERS biosensing. In regards to the direct non-labeled sensing of bacteria, it was discovered that all bands in the registered SER spectra were generated by metabolites released from bacterial cells. It undermined the prior notion of non-labeled detection and identification of bacteria based on the presumed spectra of cellular walls. However, it also provides new opportunities for the SERS analysis of bacteria. The SERS measurements of viruses can be performed with SERS-active surfaces or colloidal solutions of silver nanoparticles. However, the use of surfaces requires extensive sample preparation and often lacks sensitivity, while colloidal SERS substrates have another problem—most types of silver nanoparticles are negatively charged and have a poor interaction with likewise predominantly negatively charged virions. Thus, a challenge is posed to develop SERS-ready positively charged silver nanoparticles or use other methods to enforce the non-specific binding of viruses to the silver surfaces. Meanwhile, SER spectra of proteins are nearly impossible to acquire at adequate sensitivity. Thus, non-direct measurements are the only way. SERS provides the most benefits when working with relatively small molecules, so small molecules serving as Raman probes can be used as an intermediary to produce SER spectra. For enzymes like butyrylcholinesterase, it means measuring SER spectra of substrates and products of the relevant reaction, while for other proteins, specialized techniques must be developed. It can be concluded that biological targets require a case-by-case approach. Prior experiences with direct SERS measurements of highly Raman-active molecules like R6G and others often used in fundamental studies might not be relevant in bioanalytics.","Kurochkin, Ilya N.; Eremenko, Arkadiy V.; Evtushenko, Evgeniy G.; Nechaeva, Natalia L.; Durmanov, Nikolay N.; Guliev, Rustam R.; Ryzhikov, Ilya A.; Boginskaya, Irina A.; Sarychev, Andrey K.; Ivanov, A.

Also, COVID-19 has made it evident that many organizations do not implement state-of-the-science performance management systems and, instead, have just performance appraisal systems that typically involve a once-a-year evaluation and review, little effort to provide feedback and coaching on an ongoing basis, little alignment between employee performance and the organization’s strategic goals, a focus on past performance only, and ownership by the human resources function instead of those rating and being rated. Thus, the lack of value contributed by the usual performance evaluation and review process is the reason why so many organizations are postponing or even completely discontinuing performance evaluations. We argue that when implemented using evidence-based recommendations, performance management (rather than appraisal) serves important administrative, strategic and communication, developmental, organizational maintenance, and documentation purposes and therefore can be particularly useful in addressing contemporary talent management challenges. We offer five recommendations on how to adapt and improve performance management that will help organizations navigate crises like COVID-19 and, just as importantly, allow them to thrive after the crisis is over: (1) measure results in addition to behaviors, (2) measure adaptive performance, (3) conduct stay interviews to retain top performers, (4) implement a multisource performance management system, and (5) collect and use performance promoter scores.

Prevention of healthcare-associated infections and patient safety must apply to all institutionalized healthcare settings including TMUs. This study assessed the knowledge, attitude, and practice of TM practitioners in Bhutan in the field of infection control and waste management practices. METHODS: This was a descriptive study among TM practitioners selected through simple random sampling. Data were collected using a structured pro forma and entered in EpiData 3.1 and analyzed in STATA 13.1. RESULTS: There were 132 respondents (response rate 98%). The majority (64%) knew the seven steps of handwashing but their knowledge of WHO's Five Moments for Handwashing was poor, especially handwashing after aseptic procedures (17%) and handwashing after touching patient surroundings (5%). Handwashing before palpation of the pulse (37%) and using gloves while dispensing medicines (9%) were poor; but the proportions of handwashing before performing moxibustion (96%), correct disposal of sharps (84%), and disinfection of cupping sets (78%) were high. The majority of participants hold a positive attitude towards the adoption of infection control and waste management practices for the benefit of patients. Only 23% had received preservice and 44% had received in-service training on infection control.

The efficacy of these curricular approaches as they compare to the gold standard of dissection anatomy has been evaluated(2). In addition to helping students acquire professional competencies(3), students who participate in dissection achieve higher scores on written examinations than students who participate in prosection(1,4). Dissection helps students develop integrated three‐dimensional models of the human body, which is fundamental to clinical practice(2). In a typical year, medical students at our university take Clinical Morphology which includes histology, embryology, imaging, and dissection anatomy. In 2020, due to the global COVID‐19 pandemic, laboratory access was significantly restricted, requiring a shift to a prosection and virtual learning hybrid model. All other components of the course were retained. This necessary change in curriculum provided a natural experiment to investigate the impact of eliminating dissection anatomy on students’ academic performance. We hypothesized a negative impact. Students in the 2020 cohort worked in small groups to complete a weekly two‐hour online simulated dissection, and attended an optional weekly in‐person prosection lab. Faculty‐produced prosection videos were available to view asynchronously. Virtual office hours were held in the laboratory. In contrast, the 2019 cohort participated in a traditional dissection anatomy lab that included six hours of instructor‐supported dissection each week and 24‐hour lab access. All other course components were comparable. Respectively, for the 2020 and 2019 cohorts, mean quiz scores were 86.2 and 85.6; lab practical averages were 92.5 and 86.3; mean NBME scores were 80.9 and 82.2; and course numeric score means were 84.7 and 84.8 (no significant differences, t‐test). The frequency of passing and failing scores followed a similar pattern with no differences identified between the two cohorts (Chi Square). All 2020 students had a passing average for lab practicals; significantly better than the 2019 cohort (p < 0.05, Chi Square). Pairwise Pearson r correlation coefficients showed a strong relationship (r > 0.75) for quiz, NBME, and lab practical scores in the 2019 cohort. For the 2020 cohort, there was a strong relationship (r = 0.72) only for quiz and NBME scores. Dissection anatomy correlates strongly with quizzes and the NBME exam performance, while virtual‐prosection anatomy does not. The lack of strong pairwise correlations between virtual anatomy with either NBME or quiz performance suggest that the virtual‐prosection model did not align well with academic objectives. These data support the continued inclusion of dissection in medical school anatomy. 1. Eppler E, Serowy S, Link K, Filgueira L. Anat Sci Educ. 2018;11:32‐43. doi:10.1002/ase.1707 2.

Such assists teachers to reflect, improving their teaching through various networks. Identities are conscious thoughts interrogating subconscious thoughts that drive teachers to understand their personal needs. Eleven teachers, registered for a Master of Education degree at a university in South Africa, were purposively selected for this study. The objective of this study was to understand teachers’ identities while teaching mathematics in the 4IR. Focus-group discussions, reflective activities, and one-on-one semi-structured interviews, framed by a pragmatic case study, were used for data collection. The teachers’ identities revealed that the Three Tree Rings Theory with Currere was useful when applied as the teaching framework. Such application of the theories generated three categories of teaching identities within the 4IR. Categories were societal, professional, and personal identities. The university at which these participants were registered prescribed Moodle. However, the students mostly used social media sites such as Facebook and WhatsApp. As a result, students used digital technologies even during face-to-face classes. The study concluded that, although there were elements of both personal and professional identities, the societal identity was that which drove teaching. Consequently, this study recommends that teachers should learn to reflect on, in, and for their actions, in order to address the ‘what’, ‘how’, ‘who’, and ‘why’ questions of education, natural identity, and the 4IR/5IR.","Khoza, Simon Bheki",Tech Know Learn,3,1

We assessed if telemedicine disparities were alleviated among patients of high video use providers at a large cardiovascular practice. METHODS: All telemedicine visits from March 16(th)-October 31(st), 2020 and patient demographics were collected from an administrative database. Providers in the upper quintile of video use were classified as high-video-use providers. Descriptive statistics and a multivariable logistic model were calculated to determine the distribution and predictors of a patient ever having a video visit versus only phone visits. RESULTS: A total of 24,470 telemedicine visits were conducted among 18,950 patients by 169 providers. Video visits accounted for 48% of visits (52% phone). Among telemedicine visits conducted by high-video-use providers (n = 33), ever video patients were younger (P<.001) and included 78% of Black patients versus 86% of White patients (P<.001), 74% of Hispanic patients versus 86% of non-Hispanic patients (P<.001), and 79% of public insurance patients versus 91% of private insurance patients (P<.001). High-video-use provider patients had 9.4 (95% confidence interval, 8.4-10.4) times the odds of having video visit compared to low-video-use provider patients. DISCUSSION: These results suggest that provider-focused solutions alone, including promoting provider adoption of video visits, may not adequately reduce disparities in telemedicine engagement. Even in the presence of successful clinical infrastructure for telemedicine, individuals of Black race, Hispanic ethnicity, older age, and with public insurance continue to have decreased engagement. To achieve equity in telemedicine, patient-focused design is needed.","Grady, Connor B; Claus, Elizabeth; Bunn, David A; Pagliaro, Jaclyn A; Lichtman, Judith; Bhatt, Ami B",Eur Heart J Digit Health,3,1

The focus of these debates is increasingly on immigrants, but above all on Muslims, and thus there is now talk about an Islamized anti-Semitism. These discussions quickly became a political issue. Right-wing extremist actors such as the Alternative for Germany seized on the evidence of anti-Semitism among Muslims and instrumentalized it for their anti-Muslim agenda. This instrumentalization, in turn, makes it difficult for people working against anti-Muslim discrimination to acknowledge the existence of anti-Semitism among Muslims. Using a variety of empirical material, this article examines the prevalence of anti-Semitic resentment among Muslims and how it relates to the persistence of anti-Semitism in German society. The results show that traditional forms of anti-Semitism, and in particular Israel-related anti-Semitism, are particularly accentuated among Muslims. Together with ethnonational, right-wing extremist anti-Semitism, anti-Semitism among Muslim submilieus poses a threat to Jews in Germany. Anti-Semitism among Muslims draws on narratives from their countries of origin and on religious sources. However, anti-Semitism among Muslims in Germany is less pronounced than in most societies in the Islamic world. Moreover, guilt-denying articulations of anti-Semitism remain a hallmark of the autochthonous population and right-wing political milieus. Anti-Semitism in Germany therefore requires a more nuanced understanding than seemed necessary just a few years ago.","Öztürk, Cemal; Pickel, Gert",Z Religion Ges Polit,3,22

STUDY DESIGN Audit study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY Services Hospital, Lahore from 1st March to 30th June 2020. METHODOLOGY We calculated and compared various parameters of hospital working. Two time periods were selected. The study period was defined as the time after first confirmed case of COVID-19 in Pakistan. The control period was defined as one year prior to the first case being reported, taken from 1st March 2019 to 29th February, 2020. The parameters we studied included were number of number of hospital admissions, emergency patients, OPD patients, major surgeries, total surgeries, radiological investigations done, laboratory investigations done, births and mortalities. All parameters were calculated by taking monthly average during each time period and then compared. RESULTS A decrease in almost all parameters was seen when the cases of the two time periods were compared. There was a decrease in the average hospital admission by 51%, while the patients seen in OPD fell by almost 60%. A slight decrease of 25% was seen in the cases presenting to the emergency. The most marked decrease was in the elective surgeries, which was 66% closely followed by average monthly mortality which decreased by 64%. Average monthly minor surgeries and births were decreased by 33% and 35%, respectively. CONCLUSION There had been a decrease in the number of patients presenting to the hospital across the board with the most marked increase being in elective surgeries.

We sought to elucidate the effect of empagliflozin as an add-on therapy on decongestion and renal function in patients with type 2 diabetes admitted for acute decompensated heart failure. METHODS The study was terminated early due to COVID-19 pandemic. We enrolled 59 consecutive patients with type 2 diabetes admitted for acute decompensated heart failure. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either empagliflozin add-on (n=30) or conventional glucose-lowering therapy (n=29). We performed laboratory tests at baseline and 1, 2, 3, and 7 days after randomization. Percent change in plasma volume between admission and subsequent time points was calculated using the Strauss formula. RESULTS There were no significant baseline differences in left ventricular ejection fraction and serum NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide), hematocrit, or serum creatinine levels between the 2 groups. Seven days after randomization, NT-proBNP level was significantly lower in the empagliflozin group than in the conventional group (P=0.040), and hemoconcentration (≥3% absolute increase in hematocrit) was more frequently observed in the empagliflozin group than in the conventional group (P=0.020). The decrease in percent change in plasma volume between baseline and subsequent time points was significantly larger in the empagliflozin group than in the conventional group 7 days after randomization (P=0.017). The incidence of worsening renal function (an increase in serum creatinine ≥0.3 mg/dL) did not significantly differ between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS In this exploratory analysis, empagliflozin achieved effective decongestion without an increased risk of worsening renal function as an add-on therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes with acute decompensated heart failure.

Oral intake is an important interventional target for addressing these nutritional consequences. However, the efficacy of interventions remains poorly understood as prior syntheses have failed to examine the impact of intervention approaches on malnutrition and hypothesized mechanisms of action in persons with dementia. This review aimed to determine the efficacy of mealtime interventions to improve oral intake and nutritional outcomes in persons with dementia. Four databases yielded 1712 studies, resulting in 32 studies that met inclusion criteria. Studies included education, environmental modifications, feeding, oral supplementation, and other pharmacologic/ecopsychological interventions. While the majority of studies reported statistically significant improvements in at least 1 nutritional outcome, study design and outcome measures were heterogenous with many lacking adequate statistical power or blinding. Collectively, we found moderate evidence to suggest the efficacy of oral supplementation, and preliminary evidence to suggest that feeding interventions, education, and environmental modifications may confer improvements. Findings clarify the state of existing evidence regarding various interventional strategies for improving malnutrition in persons with dementia. While some approaches are promising, adequately powered and rigorously designed multidimensional intervention trials are needed to inform clinical decision-making in real-world contexts.","Borders, James C; Blanke, Samantha; Johnson, Stephen; Gilmore-Bykovskyi, Andrea; Rogus-Pulia, Nicole",Alzheimer disease and associated disorders,3,1

The answer is in the details.,13.820571,8.001698,2012,"BACKGROUND In cerebral palsy, spastic muscle's passive forces are considered to be high but have not been assessed directly. Although activated spastic muscle's force-joint angle relations were studied, this was independent of gait relevant joint positions. The aim was to test the following hypotheses intraoperatively: (i) spastic gracilis passive forces are high even in flexed knee positions, (ii) its active state forces attain high amplitudes within the gait relevant knee angle range, and (iii) increase with added activations of other muscles. METHODS Isometric forces (seven children with cerebral palsy, gross motor function classification score = II) were measured during surgery from knee flexion to full extension, at hip angles of 45° and 20° and in four conditions: (I) passive state, after gracilis was stimulated (II) alone, (III) simultaneously with its synergists, and (IV) also with an antagonist. FINDINGS Directly measured peak passive force of spastic gracilis was only a certain fraction of the peak active state forces (maximally 26%) measured in condition II. Conditions III and IV caused gracilis forces to increase (for hip angle = 45°, by 32.8% and 71.9%, and for hip angle = 20°, by 24.5% and 45.1%, respectively). Gait analyses indicated that intraoperative data for knee angles 61-17° and 33-0° (for hip angles 45° and 20°, respectively) are particularly relevant, where active state force approximates its peak values. INTERPRETATION Active state muscular mechanics, rather than passive, of spastic gracilis present a capacity to limit joint movement. The findings can be highly relevant for diagnosis and orthopaedic surgery in individuals with cerebral palsy.","Kaya, Cemre S; Bilgili, Fuat; Akalan, N Ekin; Temelli, Yener; Ateş, Filiz; Yucesoy, Can A",Clinical biomechanics,3,16

METHODS Data of 198 patients (280 HCC lesions), who underwent TLI plus computed tomography (CT)-guided thermal ablation at three separate medical institutions between June 2014 and September 2020, were reviewed and analyzed. The Lipiodol retention pattern was classified as complete or incomplete based on non-enhanced CT at the time of ablation. The primary outcome was local recurrence-free survival (LRFS) for lesions; the secondary outcome was overall survival (OS) for patients. Propensity score matching (PSM) was performed using a caliper width of 0.1 between the two groups. Differences in LRFS and OS between the two groups were compared using the log-rank test. RESULTS A total of 133 lesions exhibited a complete Lipiodol retention pattern, while 147 exhibited an incomplete pattern. After PSM analysis of baseline characteristics of the lesions, 121 pairs of lesions were matched. LRFS was significantly longer for lesions exhibiting complete retention than for those exhibiting incomplete retention (P = 0.030). After PSM analysis of patient baseline characteristics, 74 pairs of patients were matched. There was no significant difference in OS between the two groups (P = 0.456). CONCLUSION Lipiodol retention patterns may influence the treatment efficacy of combined TLI and thermal ablation for HCC lesions. However, a survival benefit for the Lipiodol retention pattern among HCC patients was not observed and needs further confirmation.","Tan, Jie; Mathy, René Michael; Chang, De-Hua; Tang, Tian; Zhang, Zi-Shu; Xiao, Yu-Dong",Abdominal radiology,3,33

PATIENTS AND METHODS The prospective database of two cancer centers including all consecutive patients treated with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for lung metastasis over 8 years was reviewed. RFA was carried out under general anesthesia, with computed tomography guidance using a 15-gauge multitined expandable electrodes RF needle. RESULTS Five hundred sixty-six patients including 290 men (51%), 62.7 ± 13.2 years old with primary tumor to the colon (34%), rectum (18%), kidney (12%), soft tissue (9%) and miscellaneous (27%) received 642 RFA for 1037 lung metastases. Fifty-three percent of patients had 1 metastasis, 25% had 2, 14% had 3, 5% had 4 and 4% had 5-8. Metastases were unilateral (75%), or bilateral (25%). The median diameter [extremes] of metastases was 15 mm (4-70). Twenty-two percent of patients had extrapulmonary disease amenable to local therapy including 49 liver, 16 bone and 60 miscellaneous metastases. Median follow-up was 35.5 months. Median overall survival (OS) was 62 months. Four-year local efficacy was 89%. Four-year lung disease control rate was 44.1%, with patient retreated safely up to four times. Primary origin, disease-free interval, size and number of metastases were associated with OS in multivariate analysis. Progression at RFA site was associated with poor OS [P = 0.011, hazard ratio (HR): 1.69 (95% confidence interval 1.13-2.54)]. In the 293 colorectal cancer metastases, size >2 cm (HR = 2.10, P = 0.0027) and a number of metastases ≥3 (HR = 1.86, P = 0.011) remained significantly associated with OS. A prognostic score made of three groups based on the four above-mentioned prognostic factors demonstrated 3-year OS rates of respectively 82.2%, 69.5% and 53.6% (log-rank test, P ≤ 0.0001) among the three groups in the overall population, and of 81.3%, 72.8% and 57.9% (log-rank test, P = 0.005) in the colorectal cancer patients.

This study aimed to determine the association between initial ARI admission because of viruses including human rhinovirus (HRV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human adenovirus (HAdV) and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and the risk of ARI readmission in children. METHODS Clinical information and nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected from children <2 years old at their initial ARI admission in Nha Trang, Vietnam, from January 2007 to April 2012. The incidence of ARI readmission during the follow-up period (initial admission to 5 years of age) was compared between children with and without 1 of 13 respiratory viruses (influenza virus A, influenza virus B, RSV, hMPV, parainfluenza virus-1, parainfluenza virus-2, parainfluenza virus-3 and parainfluenza virus-4, HRV, human coronavirus-229E, human coronavirus-OC43, HAdV and human bocavirus) at initial admission. RESULTS A total of 1941 children were enrolled in the study. Viruses were detected in 1254 (64.6%) children at enrollment; HRV, RSV, HAdV and hMPV were detected in 499 (25.7%), 439 (22.6%), 156 (8.0%) and 47 (2.4%) children, respectively. During the follow-up period (4572.7 person-years), 277 children were readmitted with ARI.

At 5-year follow-up, 15% of IPF patients develop lung cancer, which significantly reduces the survival rate. Here we review the literature on the clinical role of oncomarkers in IPF progression, and describe the trend of routine oncomarkers in IPF patients over the longest follow-up yet reported. MATERIALS AND METHODS A systematic search of the literature in PubMed was performed to find relevant studies published up to 24 September 2020. The most common oncomarkers were chosen to select papers related to pulmonary fibrosis. Then, 24 IPF patients and 25 non-IPF patients, followed at Careggi ILD Referral Centre and Siena Regional Referral Centre for ILD, were enrolled consecutively. RESULTS A few studies reported an association between serum oncomarkers and severity of IPF. NSE, CEA, Ca19.9, and Ca125 were higher in the IPF, than in the non-IPF, group at every follow-up (p < 0.05). Ca15.3 concentrations were higher in the IPF, than the non-IPF, group at t3 (p = 0.0080) and t4 (p = 0.0168). To improve the specificity and sensitivity of Ca15.3, a panel of biomarkers was analyzed, with the IPF group as dependent variable, and chitotriosidase, Cyfra 21.1, Ca15.3, Ca125, and Ca19.9 as independent variables. CONCLUSIONS This study focused on the discovery of multiple biomarker signatures, such as combinations of oncomarkers, that are widely and routinely available in biochemistry laboratories. The combination of clinical parameters and biological markers could help achieve more accurate results regarding prognosis and response to treatment in IPF. Our results could pave the way for a more ""personalized"" medical approach to patients affected by IPF.","d'Alessandro, Miriana; Bergantini, Laura; Torricelli, Elena; Cameli, Paolo; Lavorini, Federico; Pieroni, Maria; Refini, Rosa Metella; Sestini, Piersante; Bargagli, Elena",Cancers,3,16

METHODS A basic interpretive qualitative study approach with semi-structured interviews was conducted and analyzed using a directed and conventional content analysis. Seven participants who had left large cytology reference laboratories were purposively sampled to interview about their experience of leaving the cytology reference laboratories. Conventional content analysis was used to inductively generate themes and deductive content analysis was conducted with categories from the Transactional Model of Stress and Coping or TMSC (ie: stress appraisal and coping style). RESULTS Three main themes were discerned from the interviews; concerns about the cytology workplace, reasons for choosing to leave and strategies for coping with stress. Demand for productivity was the most commonly cited concern among cytotechnologists, followed by work-life balance and musculoskeletal strain related to microscopic screening. The top reason given for people choosing to leave the commercial laboratories was the lack of work-life balance and the second was the lack of professional challenges and growth opportunities. Participants with longer job tenure who experienced a promotion described coping with job stress as more optimistic and problem focused. CONCLUSIONS Opportunities exist within large commercial laboratories around improving work environment to reduce workplace burnout and turnover. Our findings revealed that the most common stressors encountered at large commercial laboratories are productivity demands followed by work-related musculoskeletal strains associated with microscopic screening. Additionally, the top reasons given for people leaving large reference laboratories were the lack of work-life balance and the paucity of professional challenges and growth opportunities. Furthermore, the study found that cytotechnologists with longer professional tenure at commercial laboratories appeared to be more optimistic and problem-focused in their approaches with workplace-related stress and issues.

The goal of this study was to quantify the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on operative volume at two academic neurosurgery centers in New Orleans, Louisiana from equivalent periods prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS A retrospective review was conducted analyzing neurosurgical case records for two tertiary academic centers from March through June of 2020 and March through June of 2019. The records were reviewed for variables including institution and physician coverage, operative volume by month and year, cases per subspeciality, patient demographics, mortality and morbidity. RESULTS Comparison of groups demonstrated a 34% reduction in monthly neurosurgical volume per institution during the pandemic as compared to earlier time points including a 77% decrease during April 2020. There was no change in mortality and morbidity across institutions during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on neurosurgical practice and will likely continue to have long-term effects on patients at a time when global gross domestic products decrease and relative health expenditures increase. Clinicians must anticipate and actively prepare for these impacts in the future.","Kilgore, Mitchell D; Scullen, Tyler; Mathkour, Mansour; Dindial, Rishawn; Carr, Christopher; Zeoli, Tyler; Werner, Cassidy; Kahn, Lora; Bui, Cuong J; Keen, Joseph R; Maulucci, Christopher M; Dumont, Aaron S",World neurosurgery,3,1

ARTI is associated with an increased risk for ACS up to 2 weeks prior to a cardiac event. The mechanism that may underlie this association is unclear. Infections are thought to play a role in the progression and instability of atherosclerotic plaques, resulting in plaque rupture, sudden constriction, and/or blockage of coronary arteries. Inflammation, endothelial dysfunction and thrombotic activation seem to play an important role in this. Influenza vaccination may reduce the risk of ACS in patients with coronary artery disease.

So far, this strategy has been scarcely explored. The aims of this study were to investigate the stability and bioavailability of RIF after combination of a very fast release matrix of RIF with a sustained delivery system of INH. A series of INH-alginic acid complexes (AA-INH) was obtained and characterized. Independent and sequential release profile of AA-INH at biorrelevant media of pH 1.20 and 6.80 was explored. In addition, AA-INH was combined with a RIF-carboxymethylcellulose very fast release complex (CMC-RIF) obtained previously and subjected to acid dissolution assays to evaluate RIF acid stability and determine RIF and INH dissolution efficiencies. Finally, a pharmacokinetic study in dogs was carried out. The AA-INH was easily obtained in solid-state. Their characterization revealed its ionic nature, with a loading capacity of around 30%. The dissolution efficiencies (15 min) confirmed release segregation in acid media with 7.8 and 65.6% for AA-INH and CMC-RIF, respectively. INH release rate from the AA-INH system was slow in acid media and increased in simulated intestinal media. The complete release of INH was achieved after 2 h in simulated intestinal media in the sequential release experiments. The acid degradation of RIF was significantly reduced (36.7%) when both systems were combined and oral administration to dogs revealed a 42% increase in RIF bioavailability. In conclusion, CMC-RIF and AA-INH may be useful for the formulation of a site-specific solid dosage form to overcome some of the main obstacles in tuberculosis treatment.

These patients frequently form aortopulmonary collaterals (APC), that is arterial inflows to the pulmonary artery vascular tree. The aim of this study was to develop a method to calculate the effect of APC on the pulmonary flow distribution based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measurements and computational fluid dynamics simulations in order to enable prediction of interventional outcomes in Fontan patients. METHODS Patient-specific models of 11 patients were constructed in a 3D-design software based on MRI segmentations. APC flow was quantified as the difference between pulmonary venous flow and pulmonary artery flow, measured by MRI. A method was developed to include the modulating effect of the APC flow by calculating the patient-specific relative pulmonary vascular resistance. Simulations, including interventions with a Y-graft replacement and a stent dilatation, were validated against MRI results. RESULTS The bias between simulated and MRI-measured fraction of blood to the left lung was 2·9 ± 5·3%. Including the effects of the APC flow in the simulation (n = 6) reduced simulation error from 9·8 ± 7·0% to 5·2 ± 6·3%. Preliminary findings in two patients show that the effect of surgical and catheter interventions could be predicted using the demonstrated methods. CONCLUSIONS The work demonstrates a novel method to include APC flow in predictive simulations of Fontan hemodynamics. APC flow was found to have a significant contribution to the pulmonary flow distribution in Fontan patients.","Frieberg, Petter; Sjöberg, Pia; Revstedt, Johan; Heiberg, Einar; Liuba, Petru; Carlsson, Marcus",Clinical physiology and functional imaging,3,8

This study aimed to analyze perioperative and oncologic outcomes in patients aged ≥70 years (elderly group) and compare with those <70 years (non-elderly group). METHODS From April 1997 to September 2015, 402 consecutive patients with lesions in the body and tail of the pancreas underwent LDP at Rikshospitalet, Oslo University Hospital. RESULTS Of these, 118 (29.4%) were elderly, whereas 284 (70.6%) were non-elderly. Despite higher rate of comorbidities and American Society of Anesthesiologists score (P = 0.001 and 0.001, respectively), elderly patients had lower postoperative morbidity, pancreatic fistula (PF) and readmission rates, compared with non-elderly (P = 0.032, 0.001 and 0.025, respectively). Spleen-preserving LDP (SPLDP) resulted in similar postoperative outcomes in the two groups. Elderly patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) were comparable to non-elderly in terms of median and 3-year survival (20.2 vs. 19 months (P = 0.94, log-rank) and 26.7% vs. 34.3%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS Both LDP and SPLDP are safe in patients aged ≥70 years, providing outcomes similar to those in younger group. Elderly patients with PDAC can benefit from LDP, since age itself is not associated with decreased survival after surgery.","Sahakyan, Mushegh A; Edwin, Bjørn; Kazaryan, Airazat M; Barkhatov, Leonid; Buanes, Trond; Ignjatovic, Dejan; Labori, Knut Jørgen; Røsok, Bård Ingvald",Journal of hepato-biliary-pancreatic sciences,3,19

Most of the anastomosis are currently performed with a surgical stapler that is required to have appropriate characteristics to guarantee good performances. The aim of our study was to evaluate, in the laboratory, pressure resistance and tensile strength of anastomosis performed with different surgical linear staplers, available in the market. MATERIALS AND METHODS We have been studying three linear staplers, with diverse cartridges and staple heights, of three different companies, used for gastrointestinal anastomosis and gastric or intestinal closure. We performed 50 anastomosis for each device, with the pertinent different cartridges, on fresh pig intestine, for a total of 350 anastomosis, then injected saline solution and recorded the pressure that provokes a leak on the staple line. There were no statistically significant differences between the mean pressure necessary to induce an AL in the various instruments (P > 0.05). For studying the tensile strength, we performed a total of 350 anastomosis with the different linear staplers on a special strong paper (Tyvek), then recorded the maximal tensile force that could open the anastomosis. RESULTS There were no statistically significant differences between the different staplers about the strength necessary to open the staple line (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS we demonstrated that different linear staplers of three companies available in the market give comparable anastomotic pressure resistance and tensile strength. This might suggest that small dissimilarities between different devices are not involved, at least as major parameters, in AL etiology.","Giaccaglia, Valentina; Antonelli, Maria Serena; Addario Chieco, Paola; Cocorullo, Gianfranco; Cavallini, Marco; Gulotta, Gaspare",The Journal of surgical research,3,31

Quantifying variations in extracranial carotid arteries may help in the selection and development of access catheters. This study describes the vascular dimensions from the aortic arch to the skull base. METHODS CT angiography analysis was performed on 100 patients. The lengths, diameters, and tortuosity of the common carotid artery (CCA) and internal carotid artery (ICA) were measured from the aortic arch to the skull base. RESULTS The mean±SD length of the carotid artery from the aortic arch to the skull base was 22.2±2.2 cm for the right side and 20.8±1.9 cm for the left side (p<0.0001). The length of the right CCA was 13.6±1.2 cm and the length of the left CCA was 12.4±1.4 cm (p<0.0001). The length of the right ICA was 8.6±1.4 cm compared with 8.4±1.4 cm for the left ICA (p=0.3). The ICA length in men and women was 8.9±1.3 cm and 8.2±1.3 cm, respectively (p=0.0001), and the CCA length in men and women was 13.6±1.5 cm and 12.3±1.6 cm, respectively (p<0.0001). The lengths of the CCA and ICA in patients aged ≥60 years were 13.3±1.7 cm and 8.9±1.5 cm, respectively compared with 12.8±1.7 cm and 8.2±1.1 cm, respectively, for patients aged <60 years (p=0.04 for CCA, p=0.0002 for ICA). Tortuosity of the CCA and ICA was 1.2±0.2 and 1.3±0.1, respectively, in patients aged ≥60 years compared with 1.1±0.1 for both the ICA and CCA in patients aged <60 years (p<0.0001 for both). There was a consistent ratio of CCA/ICA length of 1.6±0.3 on the right and 1.5±0.3 on the left (p<0.0001). The arterial diameters did not show any significant difference. CONCLUSIONS The distance from the aortic arch to the skull base is longer on the right than on the left side. Both the CCA and ICA are longer in men and in patients aged ≥60 years. The tortuosity of both segments significantly increases with age.","Choudhry, Farooq A; Grantham, John T; Rai, Ansaar T; Hogg, Jeffery P",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,3,6

The aim of this study was to review our experience with managing this rare presentation. METHODS A retrospective review of all cases of splenic cysts was performed over a 10-year period (2001-2011). Demographic data, clinical history, investigations, operative details and the outcome of each case were reviewed with an emphasis on patients who underwent laparoscopic stapled cyst excision. RESULTS Eleven cases were identified. Seven patients were managed surgically; six by laparoscopic stapled cyst excision and one by open excision of remnant splenic tissue. Laparoscopic management was successful in all six cases and radiological and clinical follow-up (median: 28 months) revealed no evidence of cyst recurrence in five of six cases. One patient developed an asymptomatic, non-progressing and small recurrent anterior cyst and she continues to be observed. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic stapled splenic cyst excision can be performed safely and is particularly effective for large superficial non-parasitic cysts. This technique allows spleen preservation with a low cyst recurrence rate. However, it may not be suitable for deeper intraparenchymal splenic cysts. Further studies are required to refine the management of specific subtypes of non-parasitic splenic cysts.","Kalogeropoulos, Gregory; Gundara, Justin S; Samra, Jaswinder S; Hugh, Thomas J",ANZ journal of surgery,3,26

Optimized immunohistochemistry (IHC) for TP53 has been established as a proxy for the TP53 mutation status in other ovarian tumor types. We aimed to confirm the ability of TP53 IHC to predict TP53 mutation status in ovarian mucinous tumors and to evaluate the association of TP53 mutation status with survival among patients with MBOT and MOC. Tumor tissue from an initial cohort of 113 women with MBOT/MOC was stained with optimized IHC for TP53 using tissue microarrays (75.2%) or full sections (24.8%) and interpreted using established criteria as normal or abnormal (overexpression, complete absence, or cytoplasmic). Cases were considered concordant if abnormal IHC staining predicted deleterious TP53 mutations. Discordant tissue microarray cases were re-evaluated on full sections and interpretational criteria were refined. The initial cohort was expanded to a total of 165 MBOT and 424 MOC for the examination of the association of survival with TP53 mutation status, assessed either by TP53 IHC and/or sequencing. Initially, 82/113 (72.6%) cases were concordant using the established criteria. Refined criteria for overexpression to account for intratumoral heterogeneity and terminal differentiation improved concordance to 93.8% (106/113). In the expanded cohort, 19.4% (32/165) of MBOT showed evidence for TP53 mutation and this was associated with a higher risk of recurrence, disease-specific death, and all-cause mortality (overall survival: HR = 4.6, 95% CI 1.5-14.3, p = 0.0087). Within MOC, 61.1% (259/424) harbored a TP53 mutation, but this was not associated with survival (overall survival, p = 0.77). TP53 IHC is an accurate proxy for TP53 mutation status with refined interpretation criteria accounting for intratumoral heterogeneity and terminal differentiation in ovarian mucinous tumors. TP53 mutation status is an important biomarker to identify MBOT with a higher risk of mortality.","Kang, Eun Young; Cheasley, Dane; LePage, Cecile; Wakefield, Matthew J; da Cunha Torres, Michelle; Rowley, Simone; Salazar, Carolina; Xing, Zhongyue; Allan, Prue; Bowtell, David D L; Mes-Masson, Anne-Marie; Provencher, Diane M; Rahimi, Kurosh; Kelemen, Linda E; Fasching, Peter A; Doherty, Jennifer A; Goodman, Marc T; Goode, Ellen L; Deen, Suha; Pharoah, Paul D P; Brenton, James D; Sieh, Weiva; Mateoiu, Constantina; Sundfeldt, Karin; Cook, Linda S; Le, Nhu D; Anglesio, Michael S; Gilks, C Blake; Huntsman, David G; Kennedy, Catherine J; Traficante, Nadia; DeFazio, Anna; Kaufmann, Scott; Churchman, Michael; Gourley, Charlie; Stephens, Andrew N; Meagher, Nicola S; Ramus, Susan J; Antill, Yoland C; Campbell, Ian; Scott, Clare L; Köbel, Martin; Gorringe, Kylie L","Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",3,17

While some research indicates oral antioxidant supplementation reduces side effects and improves patient survival, other studies suggest the use of antioxidant dietary supplements may interfere with chemotherapy and reduce its curative effects. There is a need to clarify the evidence base on the impact of dietary antioxidant supplementation during chemotherapy on both side effect and treatment efficacy outcomes. We will use a scoping review approach to identify what systematic review evidence exists regarding beneficial and harmful effects of dietary antioxidant supplements when used during cancer treatment. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will use Arksey & O'Malley and Joanna Briggs Institute methods for scoping reviews. We will systematically search PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Scopus, Dissertations & Theses Global and the Cochrane Library from inception to October 2020. Systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials of oral dietary antioxidant supplements used by participants receiving curative chemotherapy, radiotherapy or other biological therapy for cancer will be eligible. Two reviewers will screen citations and full texts for inclusion and chart data on research questions from included reviews. Two reviewers will assess the overall confidence in systematic review results using A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews-2 (AMSTAR-2), and summarised evidence will focus on reviews rated at high or moderate overall confidence. Tables will be used to map existing evidence and identify evidence gaps for safety and effectiveness outcomes. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION This scoping review does not require ethical approval as it is a secondary assessment of available literature. The results will be presented at conferences and submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal. We will also disseminate results to community and clinical stakeholders and involve them in developing subsequent research to address critical existing gaps in the evidence as identified by the scoping review.","Wieland, L Susan; Moffet, Ilana; Shade, Sydney; Emadi, Ashkan; Knott, Cheryl; Gorman, Emily F; D'Adamo, Christopher",BMJ open,3,1

Over a longer duration of stroking, affective habituation sets in, indicated by a reduction in rated pleasantness. However, it is not clear whether the group level effect is represented on an individual level. We analyze the stability of individual ratings of slow stroking touch and their relationship to behavioural and physiological measures. 48 participants (23 women) were repeatedly stroked with a velocity maximally activating C-tactile fibres. The perceived pleasantness was rated on a visual analogue scale. In order to examine the stability of pleasantness ratings, the experiment was repeated after a couple of days. During the experiment, electrocardiogram (ECG) and facial- electromyography (EMG) data were recorded. On the group-level, previous results of affective habituation to touch were replicated and stable across sessions. On the individual level, however, less than half of the participants showed a significant reduction of pleasantness in the course of the experiment. Moreover, the remaining participants showed either no change, random rating behaviour or even an increase in pleasantness ratings during the course of the experiment. The individual response patterns were variable across sessions but stable above the chance level. Furthermore, the response patterns could not be explicitly associated with any of the behavioural or physiological measures. Our findings indicate a lack of group-to-individual generalizability for affective habituation to touch. The variability of rating patterns over time indicates that they are not conclusively determined by stable individual characteristics. Future research investigating touch should favour a more individual approach to the more commonly applied group analysis.","Bendas, Johanna; Ree, Anbjørn; Pabel, Luise; Sailer, Uta; Croy, Ilona",Neuroscience,3,16

The outbreak has been declared a pandemic by the WHO on Mar 11, 2020. Here, we explore how seasonal variation in transmissibility could modulate a SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Data from routine diagnostics show a strong and consistent seasonal variation of the four endemic coronaviruses (229E, HKU1, NL63, OC43) and we parameterise our model for SARS-CoV-2 using these data. The model allows for many subpopulations of different size with variable parameters. Simulations of different scenarios show that plausible parameters result in a small peak in early 2020 in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and a larger peak in winter 2020/2021. Variation in transmission and migration rates can result in substantial variation in prevalence between regions. While the uncertainty in parameters is large, the scenarios we explore show that transient reductions in the incidence rate might be due to a combination of seasonal variation and infection control efforts but do not necessarily mean the epidemic is contained. Seasonal forcing on SARS-CoV-2 should thus be taken into account in the further monitoring of the global transmission. The likely aggregated effect of seasonal variation, infection control measures, and transmission rate variation is a prolonged pandemic wave with lower prevalence at any given time, thereby providing a window of opportunity for better preparation of health care systems.","Neher, Richard A; Dyrdak, Robert; Druelle, Valentin; Hodcroft, Emma B; Albert, Jan",Swiss medical weekly,3,31

So far, the number of COVID-19-associated deaths per 100,000 individuals is far lower in these countries as compared with other neighbouring or close countries. The use of face masks in public may not protect the general public from contracting the virus, however, presumptively decreases the viral load and contributes to a favourable clinical outcome in COVID-19 disease. A certain time is required for antigen-specific T cells and B cells to fully develop. Obligatory face mask wearing in public favours the virus transmission through oral mucosa and/or conjunctival epithelium, which enables the adaptive immune responses to evolve. In the case of inhalation of high loads of SARS-CoV-2, the time for the development of fully protective adaptive immune responses seems to be insufficient. Then, a less specific and more damaging innate immune response prevails.","Střížová, Zuzana; Bartůňková, Jiřina; Smrž, Daniel",Central European journal of public health,3,31

SOGIECE are associated with significant adverse health and social outcomes. SOGIECE continue to be practiced around the world, despite denouncements from professional bodies and survivors, as well as calls for legislative advocacy to prohibit SOGIECE and protect SGM. There are substantial gaps in the availability of consolidated international research to support and refine legislative proposals related to SOGIECE, including those currently underway to enforce bans in Canada and elsewhere. We therefore propose the first systematic review of international data on SOGIECE that will outline the scope and nature of these practices worldwide. Specifically, we aim to estimate how many SGM have been exposed to SOGIECE, which sub-groups of SGM experience higher rates of SOGIECE, and how estimates of SOGIECE vary over time and place. In addition, we aim to describe when, where, how, and under what circumstances SGM are exposed to SOGIECE. METHODS To locate an interdisciplinary swath of papers, nine (9) bibliographic databases will be searched: Medline (OVID), Embase (OVID), PsycInfo and Social Work Abstracts via EBSCO, CINAHL, Web of Science Core Collection, LGBTQ+ Source, and Proquest Dissertations & Theses Global and Sociology Collection (ProQuest). A gold standard search will be developed for Medline and adapted to the other databases. Grey literature will be searched at relevant websites, and reference harvesting will be performed in relevant SOGIECE scientific consensus statements. Two authors will independently screen abstracts/titles, screen full texts, abstract data, and apply risk of bias assessments. A narrative synthesis will be implemented to summarize findings. DISCUSSION This review will address the gap in synthesized data regarding the prevalence of SOGIECE, social correlates of SOGIECE, variations of SOGIECE over time and place, and the circumstances, settings, and time-points of SOGIECE exposure. Findings from this review will directly inform ongoing and new legislative efforts to ban SOGIECE and other interventions that aim to stem SOGIECE practices and support SOGIECE survivors.

Repetitive activation of sensory input using active and passive sensory-based interventions have been shown to enhance adaptive motor cortical plasticity, indicating a potential mechanism which may mediate recovery. However, rehabilitation specifically focusing on somatosensory function receives little attention. Objectives: To investigate sensory-based interventions reported in the literature and determine the effectiveness to improve sensation and sensorimotor function of individuals following stroke. Methods: Electronic databases and trial registries were searched from inception until November 2018, in addition to hand searching systematic reviews. Study selection included randomized controlled trials for adults of any stroke type with an upper and/or lower limb sensorimotor impairment. Participants all received a sensory-based intervention designed to improve activity levels or impairment, which could be compared with usual care, sham, or another intervention. The primary outcomes were change in activity levels related to sensorimotor function. Secondary outcomes were measures of impairment, participation or quality of life. Results: A total of 38 study trials were included (n = 1,093 participants); 29 explored passive sensory training (somatosensory; peripheral nerve; afferent; thermal; sensory amplitude electrical stimulation), 6 active (sensory discrimination; perceptual learning; sensory retraining) and 3 hybrid (haptic-based augmented reality; sensory-based feedback devices). Meta-analyses (13 comparisons; 385 participants) demonstrated a moderate effect in favor of passive sensory training on improving a range of upper and lower limb activity measures following stroke. Narrative syntheses were completed for studies unable to be pooled due to heterogeneity of measures or insufficient data, evidence for active sensory training is limited however does show promise in improving sensorimotor function following stroke. Conclusions: Findings from the meta-analyses and single studies highlight some support for the effectiveness of passive sensory training in relation to sensory impairment and motor function. However, evidence for active sensory training continues to be limited. Further high-quality research with rigorous methods (adequately powered with consistent outcome measures) is required to determine the effectiveness of sensory retraining in stroke rehabilitation, particularly for active sensory training.","Serrada, Ines; Hordacre, Brenton; Hillier, Susan L",Frontiers in neuroscience,3,1

DESIGN Retrospective case series. ANIMALS 144 client-owned dogs and cats that underwent cystotomy between 1993 and 2010. PROCEDURES Information on signalment, reason for cystotomy, method of cystotomy closure, complications that developed during hospitalization, and duration of hospitalization were obtained from the medical record. The effect of closure technique on short-term complication rate and duration of hospitalization was examined. RESULTS 2 of the 144 animals developed dehiscence and uroabdomen following cystotomy closure: 1 from group A and 1 from group I. Of group A animals, 29 of 79 (37%) developed minor complications such as hematuria and dysuria. Of group I animals, 33 of 65 (50%) developed the same complications. Group A and group I animals did not differ significantly with regard to prevalence of minor or major complications. The mean duration of hospitalization was 4.1 days and did not differ significantly between groups. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE An appositional single-layer suture pattern for cystotomy closure was a safe and effective procedure with minimal risk of urine leakage and a short-term complication rate of 37%. The appositional single-layer suture pattern for cystotomy closure may be recommended for clinical use because the inverting double-layer suture pattern offered no clear advantage.","Thieman-Mankin, Kelley M; Ellison, Gary W; Jeyapaul, Cynthia J; Glotfelty-Ortiz, Carmen S",Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association,3,31

During the open repair of the presenting hernia, the surgeon was often unaware of these occult hernias. These patients postoperatively may present with unexplained chronic groin or pelvic pain. PRESENTATION OF CASE Rare groin hernias are defined according to their anatomical position. Challenges in the diagnosis and management of occult rare groin hernias are discussed. These problems are illustrated by a unique case report of multiple (six) coexisting groin hernias, whereof five were occult and two were rare. DISCUSSION Rare groin hernias are uncommon because they are difficult to diagnose clinically and are not routinely looked for. They are often occult and may coexist with other inguinal hernias, thus posing a diagnostic and treatment challenge to the surgeon, especially if there is persistent groin pain after ""successful"" repair. MRI is the most accurate preoperative and postoperative diagnostic tool, if there is a clinical suspicion that the patient might have an occult hernia. CONCLUSION Preperitoneal endoscopic approach is the recommended method in confirming the diagnosis and management of occult groin hernias. A sound knowledge of groin anatomy and a thorough preperitoneal inspection of all possible sites for rare groin hernias are needed to diagnose and repair all defects. The preperitoneal mesh repair with adequate overlap of all hernia orifices is the recommended treatment of choice.","Matsevych, O Y; Koto, M Z; Becker, J H R",International journal of surgery case reports,3,1

Patients undergoing surgery are a group at risk of exposure. Also, patients with ongoing infection undergoing surgery may be more susceptible to developing complications. There is no significant data on surgical safety in the pandemic period. MATERIAL AND METHODS Observational study based in a prospective database of urological oncological surgery. Data were obtained during the 2020 mandatory confinement period compared to the same period in 2019. The records were reviewed 45 days post-surgery. The objective was to compare surgical morbidity and mortality during the pandemic versus an average year in urological cancer surgery. RESULTS During confinement period (2020), 85 patients underwent uro-oncology surgery, while in 2019, during the same period, 165. The Clavien-Dindo morbidity ≥3 in 2020 was 2.3% (n=2), and in 2019, it reached 6% (n=10). In 2020, 9 patients were readmitted (10.5%). One patient (1.1%) was re-interfered, with a perioperative mortality of 1.1%. In 2019, 21 patients (12.7%) were readmitted. Seventeen patients (10.3%) were re-interfered, with a perioperative mortality of 1.8%. The median number of days hospitalized was 2 (IQR=2) in 2020 and 3 (IQR=3) in 2019. No significant differences were found in population or morbimortality, except for reoperation in a normal year. CONCLUSION Postoperative morbidity and mortality reported are lower than those shown in the literature concerning COVID-19 and similar to that historically reported by our centers. This study suggests that it is safe to operate patients with urological cancer following the appropriate protocols during a pandemic.","Bravo, Juan Cristóbal; Navarro, Renato; Rojas, P; Hinrichs, Laura; Schalper, Maximiliano; Zuñiga, Alvaro; San Francisco, Ignacio",Urology journal,3,31

There has not yet been a systematic, critical appraisal of the relative strength of evidence among subsets of the practice of facial plastic surgery. METHODS The current study is a systematic review, designed to evaluate the level of evidence observed in the facial plastic surgery literature. Five journals were queried using facial plastic surgery terms for four selected years over a 10-year period. Following screening, articles were assigned to a category regarding subject matter, assessed for the presence of various methodological traits, and evaluated for overall level of evidence. Comparisons were made in regard to level of evidence across the breadth of facial plastic surgery subject matter. RESULTS A total of 826 articles were included for final review. Studies on operative facial rejuvenation and rhinoplasty had significantly fewer authors on average than studies on cancer reconstruction or craniofacial topics. Craniofacial studies demonstrated higher levels of evidence relative to all other categories, with the exception of facial paralysis and facial trauma studies, from which there was no significant difference. In general, reconstructive studies had significantly more authors and higher levels of evidence than did articles with an aesthetic focus. CONCLUSION Level of evidence in facial plastic surgery remains relatively weak overall. Reconstructive and particularly craniofacial studies demonstrate higher mean level of evidence, relative to other subsets of facial plastic surgery.

I explore how public health data and knowledge are repackaged into visualisations and presented in four contemporary genres: the animation, the TED Talk, the documentary and the satire programme. I focus on how different actors describe a world in which there are no or few antibiotics that are effective against bacterial infections. I examine the form, content and style of the visual cultural of AMR, examining how these genres tell a story of impending apocalypse while also trying to advert it. This is a form of story-telling based around the if/then structure: we are told that if we do not take certain actions today, then we will face a postantibiotic future with certain, often catastrophic, consequences. Within this if/then structure, there are various aims and objectives: the goal may be preventing further spread of AMR, building awareness or pushing for certain policy or funding decisions. These stories also serve to place or deflect blame, on animals, occupations, patients, industries and others and to highlight risks and consequences. These examples share similarities in the forms of story-telling and narrative, and in the use of specific data sources and other images. By using several Swedish examples, I demonstrate how global data are reinterpreted for a national audience. Overall, I argue that while the convergence of a dominant narrative indicates scientific consensus, this consensus also stifles our collective imagination in finding new solutions to the problem. Finally, I also use the example of AMR to discuss the need for a broader social science and humanities engagement with the visual culture of global health data.","Irwin, Rachel",Medical humanities,3,1

To mitigate the crisis, the design of vaccines is a crucial solution. The frequent mutation of the virus demands generalized vaccine candidates, which would be effective for all mutated strains at present and for the strains that would evolve due to further new mutations in the virus. OBJECTIVE The objective of this study is to identify more frequently occurring mutated variants of SARS-CoV-2 and to suggest peptide vaccine candidates effective in common against the viral strains considered. METHOD In this study, we have identified all currently prevailing mutated strains of SARS-CoV-2 through 2D Polar plot and Quotient Radius〖(q〗_R) characterization descriptor. Then, by considering the top eight mutation strains, which are significant due to their frequency of occurrence, peptide regions suitable for vaccine design have been identified with the help of a mathematical model - 2D Polygon Representation, followed by the evaluation of epitope potential and ensuring that there is no case of any autoimmune threat. Lastly, in order to verify whether this entire approach is applicable for vaccine design against any other virus in general, we have made a comparative study between the peptide vaccine candidates prescribed for the Zika virus using the current approach and a list of potential vaccine candidates for the same already established in the past. RESULTS We have finally suggested three generalized peptide regions which would be suitable as sustainable peptide vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV-2 irrespective of its currently prevailing strains as well any other variant of the same that may appear in the future. We also observed that during the comparative study using the case of E protein of Zika virus, the peptide regions suggested using the new approach matched with the already established results. CONCLUSION The study, therefore, illustrates an approach that would help in developing peptide vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 by suggesting those peptide regions which can be targeted irrespective of any mutated form of this virus. The consistency with which this entire approach was also able to figure out similar vaccine candidates for Zika virus with utmost accuracy proves that this protocol can be extended for peptide vaccine design against any other virus in the future.","Biswas, Subhamoy; Manna, Smarajit; Dey, Tathagata; Chatterjee, Shreyans; Dey, Sumanta",Combinatorial chemistry & high throughput screening,3,19

Gp5 and M proteins form disulfide-linked heterodimers that constitute the major components of PRRSV envelope. Gp2, Gp3, Gp4 and E are the minor structural proteins, being the first three incorporated as multimeric complexes in the virus surface. The disease has become one of the most important causes of economic losses in the swine industry. Despite efforts to design an effective vaccine, the available ones allow only partial protection. In the last years, VLPs have become good vaccine alternatives because of safety issues and their potential to activate both branches of the immunological response. The characteristics of recombinant baculoviruses as heterologous expression system have been exploited for the production of VLPs of a wide variety of viruses. In this work, two multiple baculovirus expression vectors (BEVs) with PRRS virus envelope proteins were engineered in order to generate PRRS VLPs: on the one hand, Gp5 and M cDNAs were cloned to generate the pBAC-Gp5M vector; on the other hand, Gp2, Gp3, Gp4 and E cDNAs have been cloned to generate the pBAC-Gp234E vector. The corresponding recombinant baculoviruses BAC-Gp5M and BAC-Gp234E were employed to produce two types of VLPs: basic Gp5M VLPs, by the simultaneous expression of Gp5 and M proteins; and complete VLPs, by the co-expression of the six PRRS proteins after co-infection. The characterization of VLPs by Western blot confirmed the presence of the recombinant proteins using the available specific antibodies (Abs). The analysis by Electron microscopy showed that the two types of VLPs were indistinguishable between them, being similar in shape and size to the native PRRS virus. This system represents a potential alternative for vaccine development and a useful tool to study the implication of specific PRRS proteins in the response against the virus.","García Durán, Marga; Costa, Sofia; Sarraseca, Javier; de la Roja, Nuria; García, Julia; García, Isabel; Rodríguez, Maria José",Journal of virological methods,3,16

The aim of the SAGES Technology and Value Assessment Committee aims is to evaluate the efficacy, value, and safety of WATS3D. METHODS Clinical studies involving WATS3D were identified via a search of the PubMed/Medline databases (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed) conducted in March of 2019 using search terms, such as wide-area transepithelial sampling, three-dimensional (3D) computer-assisted analysis, WATS-3D, Barrett's esophagus and WATS-3D, Barrett's esophagus and wide-area transepithelial sampling with three-dimensional computer-assisted analysis, Barrett's esophagus, and emerging technology. Bibliographies of key references were searched for relevant studies not covered by the PubMed search. Case reports and small case series were excluded. RESULTS No significant morbidity or mortality was reported within the literature associated with the WATS3D technology. WATS3D increases diagnostic yield by 38-150% for Barrett's Esophagus, by 40-150% for Low Grade Dysplasia; and by 420% for High Grade Dysplasia; when compared to forceps biopsy alone. WATS3D technique has very high inter-observer agreement for the pathological diagnosis of non-dysplastic and dysplastic Barrett's Esophagus.

The physical restrictions result in negative consequences on an individual's physical and psychosocial functions. This proposal describes a systematic review protocol to determine the effectiveness and approaches of sitting Tai Chi intervention for individuals with impaired physical mobility. Our review would inform stakeholders' decisions in integrating this complementary therapy into current rehabilitation services. METHODS Randomized controlled trials or quasi-experimental studies that compared an intervention group receiving sitting Tai Chi with a control group among adult participants with impaired physical mobility resulting from any health condition(s) will be included. Outcomes of interest will include physical and psychosocial health outcomes. The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, Web of Science, AMED, PsycINFO, SPORDiscus, PEDro, WanFang Data and China National Knowledge Infrastructure will be searched from their inception to January 2020. Additional searches will be performed to identify studies that are being refereed, to be published, unpublished or ongoing. Two reviewers will select the trials and extract data independently. The risk of bias of the included studies will be assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tools. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation will be used to assess evidence quality for each review outcome. Data synthesis will be performed using Review Manager 5.3. When a meta-analysis is possible, we will assess the heterogeneity across the studies by computing the I statistics. RESULTS A high-quality synthesis of current evidence of sitting Tai Chi for impaired physical mobility will be stated from several aspect using subjective reports and objective measures of performance.

We aim to evaluate the value of B cell-activating factor (BAFF) in paediatric IBD as a potential biomarker for follow-up. METHOD We determined BAFF in serum and faeces and faecal calprotectin (CP) in 32 IBD children-16 Crohn's disease (CD) and 16 ulcerative colitis (UC). Twenty-six healthy children and 10 children with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) were included as controls. RESULTS No differences were found in serum BAFF between IBD, IBS, and healthy group: 1037.35, 990.9 and 979.8 pg/ml, respectively, all p > 0.05, but faecal BAFF was higher in the IBD group: 15.1, 8.5 and 8.2 pg/ml, respectively, p < 0.05, and higher in the UC group (55.975 pg/ml) compared to the CD group (10.95 pg/ml), p = 0.015. Splitting the IBD group in relation to the CP level, the serum BAFF had no significantly different values between the subgroups, but the faecal BAFF was significantly higher in the >250 μg/g subgroup. Cut-off values of BAFF were calculated. CONCLUSION Faecal BAFF is a promising marker for monitoring the children with IBD, higher levels of BAFF being correlated with high CP. IMPACT Faecal BAFF is a promising marker in monitoring the children with IBD, higher levels of BAFF being correlated with high faecal calprotectin.To our knowledge, this is the first paediatric study concerning BAFF evaluation in IBD.Faecal BAFF levels could be considered a potential non-invasive marker in monitoring IBD activity in paediatric population with clinically mild or inactive disease.Fig. 1Box plots of faecal BAFF concentration in the whole group with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and distinctly on Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) groups compared with the control group.Fig. 2Box plots of serum BAFF concentration in the whole group with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and distinctly on Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) groups compared with the control group.Fig. 3Correlation between faecal calprotectin and faecal BAFF in relation to the whole group of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (a), Crohn's disease (CD) (b) and ulcerative colitis (UC) (c).","Fodor, Ioana; Serban, Oana; Serban, Daniela E; Farcau, Dorin; Man, Sorin Claudiu; Dumitrascu, Dan Lucian",Pediatric research,3,14

Currently, there areno effective preventive or treatment strategies for COVID-19 and has been declared as a global health emergency by WHO. In silico molecular docking studies can be useful to predict the binding affinity between the phytocompound and the target protein and play a vital role in finding an inhibitor through structure-based drug design. OBJECTIVE In this aspect, our objective was to screen essential flavonoids against possible protein targets such as SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein receptor binding domain (RBD-S) and host Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 protease domain (PD-ACE-2) using in silico molecular docking studies. METHODS Approximately 49 flavonoids were identified, evaluated for their drug likeness based on Lipinski rule, bioactivity scores, antiviral and toxicity profiles using SwissADME, Molinspiration, PASS and GUSAR online tools. The flavonoids that passed Lipinski rule were subjected to in silico analysis through molecular docking on RBD-S and PD-ACE-2 using Molegro Virtual Docker v6.0. RESULTS The bioactive flavonoids that showed NIL violations and found in compliance with Lipinski rule were selected for docking studies. In silicoanalysis reported that biochanin A and silymarin bind significantly at the active sites of RBD-Sand PD-ACE-2 with a MolDock score of -78.41and -121.28 kcal/mol respectively. Bioactivity scores, antiviral potential and tox-icity profiles were predicted for the top interacting phytocompounds and substantial relevant data was reported. CONCLUSION The current outcomes created a new paradigm in understanding biochanin A and silymarin bioflavonoids as potent inhibitors of RBD-Sand PD-ACE-2 targets respectively, further work can be extended to confirm their therapeutic potential in COVID-19.","Gorla, Uma Sankar; Rao, Gsn Koteswara; Kulandaivelu, Uma Sankar; Alavala, Rajasekhar Reddy; Panda, Siva Prasad",Combinatorial chemistry & high throughput screening,3,1

Educational programs, such as educational outreach (EO), are designed to change the behaviour of health professionals. The purpose of this study was to identify the efficacy of EO programs at changing the prescribing behaviour of GPs. METHODS This study included an evidence and practice review, comprising a rapid review supplemented by interviews with people who are familiar with EO implementation for regulation purposes. Seven databases were searched using terms related to health professionals and prescribing. Systematic and narrative reviews published in English after 2007 were included. Non-statistical analysis was used to report intervention efficacy. Three government representatives participated in semi-structured interviews to aid in understanding the relevance of review findings to the Victorian context. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and thematically analysed for emerging themes. RESULTS Fourteen reviews were identified for the evidence review. Isolated (e.g. EO program delivered by itself) and multifaceted (e.g. EO program supplemented by other interventions) programs were found to change prescribing behaviours. However, limited evidence suggests that EO can successfully change prescribing behaviours specific to GPs. Isolated EO can successfully change health professional prescribing behaviours, although cheaper alternatives such as letters might be just as effective. Multifaceted EO can also successfully change health professional prescribing behaviours, especially in older adults, but it remains unclear as to what combination of interventions works best. Success factors for EO reported by government representatives included programs having practical rather than didactic foci; making EO compulsory; focussing EO on preventing adverse events; using monetary or professional development incentives; and in-person delivery. CONCLUSIONS Educational outreach can successfully change prescribing behaviours but evidence specific to GPs is lacking. Key characteristics of EO that could optimise success include ensuring the EO program is tailored, involves practical learning and uses incentives that are meaningful to clinicians.","Kunstler, Breanne E; Lennox, Alyse; Bragge, Peter",BMC medical education,3,2

METHODS In this longitudinal observational study, analysis of enhanced depth imaging spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-EDI-OCT) images of 22 patients with angiographically proven unilateral CCF with anterior drainage was performed for subfoveal choroidal thickness (SFCT), central foveal thickness (CFT), CVI and TI. Baseline measurements were compared with those taken at the last visit after occlusion of the fistula. RESULTS Both in the clinically affected and unaffected eyes, there was a significant decrease in CFT (p = 0.015 and p = 0.005, respectively), SFCT (p = 0.000 for both eyes), CVI (p = 0.002 and 0.001, respectively) and all three TI parameters, including inferior (p < 0.001 and p = 0.01, respectively) and superior temporal vein tortuosity index (p = 0.005 and p = 0.02, respectively) as well as total venular tortuosity index (p < 0.001 and p = 0.002, respectively) after successful closure of the fistula compared to first presentation. Changes in all parameters were similar between the D-CCF and I-CCF groups except for CVI. CONCLUSIONS In this first study concerning follow-up of anteriorly draining unilateral CCFs by SD-EDI-OCT, we not only demonstrated involvement of the clinically unaffected eye but also showed that, this modality, utilizing CVI and TI together with choroidal thickness measurements, can be used as a readily available, noninvasive first-line followup method for evaluating occlusion of fistulas by endovascular treatment or spontaneous resolution.","Arat, Yonca Ozkan; İnam, Onur; Yavas, Guliz Fatma; Arat, Anil",Eye,3,16

The present study investigated the withanolides as an immune booster and anti-viral agents against the coronavirus-19. Withanolides from Withania somnifera were retrieved from the open-source database, their targets were predicted using DIGEP-Pred, and the protein-protein interaction was evaluated. The drug-likeness score and intestinal absorptivity of each compound were also predicted. The network of compounds, proteins, and modulated pathways was constructed using Cytoscape, and docking was performed using autodock4.0, and selected protein-ligand complexes were subjected to 100 ns Molecular Dynamics simulations. The molecular dynamics trajectories were subjected to free energy calculation by the MM-GBSA method. Withanolide_Q was predicted to modulate the highest number of proteins, showed human intestinal absorption, and was predicted for the highest drug-likeness score. Similarly, combined network interaction identified Withanolide_Q to target the highest number of proteins; RAC1 was majorly targeted, and fluid shear stress and atherosclerosis associated pathway were chiefly regulated. Similarly, Withanolide_D and Withanolide_G were predicted to have a better binding affinity with PLpro, Withanolide_M with 3CLpro, and Withanolide_M with spike protein based on binding energy and number of hydrogen bond interactions. MD studies suggested Withanoside_I with the highest binding free energy (ΔGbind-31.56 kcal/mol) as the most promising inhibitor. Among multiple withanolides from W. somnifera, Withanolide_D, Withanolide_G, Withanolide_M, and Withanolide_Q were predicted as the lead hits based on drug-likeness score, modulated proteins, and docking score to boost the immune system and inhibit the COVID-19 infection, which could primarily act against COVID-19. Highlights Withanolides are immunity boosters. Withanolides are a group of bio-actives with potential anti-viral properties. Withanolide_G, Withanolide_I, and Withanolide_M from Withania somnifera showed the highest binding affinity with PLpro, 3CLpro, and spike protein, respectively.

METHODS We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies and randomized controlled trials (RCT) with ESA to estimate the effect of different achieved Hb values on physical HRQOL and functionality. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, CENTRAL, PEDro, PsycINFO and Web of Science databases, until May 2020. Two authors independently extracted data from studies. We included observational and RCTs that enrolled CKD patients undergoing anemia treatment with ESA with different achieved Hb levels among groups. We excluded studies with achieved Hb < 9 g/dL. For the meta-analysis, we included RCTs with control groups achieving Hb 10-11.5 g/dL and active groups with Hb > 11.5 g/dL. We analyzed the standardized mean difference (SMD) between groups for physical HRQOL. RESULTS Among 8496 studies, fifteen RCTs and five observational studies were included for the systematic review. We performed the meta-analysis in a subset of eleven eligible RCTs. For physical role and physical function, SMDs were 0.0875 [95% CI: - 0.0025 - 0.178] and 0.08 [95% CI: - 0.03 - 0.19], respectively. For fatigue, SMD was 0.16 [95% CI: 0.09-0.24]. Subgroup analysis showed that trials with greater achieved Hb had greater pooled effects sizes - 0.21 [95% CI: 0.07-0.36] for Hb > 13 g/dL vs. 0.09 [95% CI: 0.02-0.16] for Hb 11.5-13 g/dL. Proportion of older and long-term diabetic patients across studies were associated with lower effect sizes. CONCLUSION Achieved hemoglobin higher than currently recommended targets may be associated with small but potentially clinically significant improvement in fatigue, but not in physical role or physical function. Younger and non-diabetic patients may experience more pronounced benefits of higher Hb levels after treatment with ESAs.","Guedes, Murilo; Guetter, Camila R; Erbano, Lucas H O; Palone, Andre G; Zee, Jarcy; Robinson, Bruce M; Pisoni, Ronald; de Moraes, Thyago Proença; Pecoits-Filho, Roberto; Baena, Cristina P",BMC nephrology,3,12

This study aimed to assess whether the implementation of a bladder scan-based voiding protocol reduces the time until discharge after ambulatory inguinal herniorraphy without increasing the rate of POUR. METHODS As part of a perioperative care pathway, a protocol was implemented to standardize decision making after elective inguinal hernia repair (February 2012). Patients were assessed with a bladder scan, and those with <600 mL of urine were discharged home, whereas those with more than 600 mL of urine had an in-and-out catheterization before discharge. The patients received written information about urinary symptoms and instructions to present to the emergency department if they were unable to void at home. An audit of scheduled outpatient inguinal hernia repairs between October 2011 and July 2012 was performed. Comparisons were made using the t test, Fisher's exact test, and Wilcoxon rank sum test where appropriate. Statistical significance was defined a priori as a p value lower than 0.05. RESULTS During the study period, 124 patients underwent hernia repair: 60 before and 64 after implementation of the protocol. The findings showed no significant differences in patient characteristics, laparoscopic approach (35 vs. 33%; p = 0.80), proportion receiving general anesthesia (70 vs. 73%; p = 0.67), or amount of intravenous fluids given (793 vs. 663 mL; p = 0.07). The proportion of patients voiding before discharge was higher after protocol implementation (73 vs. 89%; p = 0.02). The protocol had no impact on median time to discharge (190 vs. 205 min; p = 0.60). Only one patient in each group presented to the emergency department with POUR (2%). CONCLUSION After ambulatory inguinal herniorraphy, implementation of a bladder scan-based voiding protocol did not result in earlier discharge. The incidence of POUR was lower than reported in the literature.","Antonescu, I; Baldini, G; Watson, D; Kaneva, P; Fried, G M; Khwaja, K; Vassiliou, M C; Carli, F; Feldman, L S",Surgical endoscopy,3,19

These works are currently at different clinical trial stages, and their results may be determined by the outcome of the ongoing trial process. There is the need for a collection of information regarding the availlable therapeutic options related to COVID-19. this article therefore reviewed emerging and re-emerging therapeutic compounds/drugs used in COVID-19 management and reports of clinical trials, with the view to summarize and highlight their prospect and possible adverse effects to allow more extensive choice by clinicians, researchers, and policymakers. The approach used involved retrieval of related collections found in selected repositories including, Medline, Scopus, PubMed, and Google scholar. Only experimental or clinical studies were included. Out of the 39 materials retrieved, 26 (66.67%) studies were based on clinical trials, 12 (30.77%) were classified as in vitro studies, and only one (2.56%) involved experimental animal study. Of the agents evaluated for COVID-19 therapeutics, 15 (38.46%) were anti-viral, four (10.26%) antimalarial, four studies were immunotherapeutics (10.26%), two studies (5.13%) were antibacterial, while, one (2.56%) study wasfor antiparasitic , anticoagulant, anti-inflammatory, anti-viral/antimalarial, and anti-viral/herbal combination for each. Also, eight studies (20.51%) were antibiotic/antimalarial.. This review indicates that there is both a race and quest in the test of antiviral agents against COVID-19 and that arbidol seems to have dominated in the studies analyzed. The use of anticoagulants and antibiotics, such as teicoplanin and azithromycin/hydroxychloroquine were reported to also play a leading role in the management of the disease. Likewise, dexamethasone has been recently claimed to be effective in patients in need of respiratory assistance. Based on unresolved controversies and inconclusive findings, it could be said that generally, a single and specific therapeutics to COVID-19 is still a mirage. There is, thus, an urgent need to test more potent compounds and agents to establish much safer and highly efficacious drugs/agents for the disease, even as we continue to learn more about the disease as well as the characteristic of the virus.","Ismaila, Muhammad Sani; Bande, Faruku; Ishaka, Aminu; Sani, Aminatu Abubakar; Georges, Karla",Journal of chemotherapy,3,33

Specifically, receiving mechanical ventilation for over 24 hours increases the risk of VAP and is associated with high morbidity, mortality, and medical costs. Cost-effective endotracheal tubes (ETTs) that are resistant to bacterial infections could help prevent this problem. The objective of this study was to determine differences in the growth of Staphylococcus aureus on nanomodified and unmodified polyvinyl chloride (PVC) ETTs under dynamic airway conditions simulating a ventilated patient. PVC ETTs were modified to have nanometer surface features by soaking them in Rhizopus arrhisus, a fungal lipase. Twenty-four-hour experiments (supported by computational models) showed that airflow conditions within the ETT influenced both the location and the concentration of bacterial growth on the ETTs, especially within areas of tube curvature. More importantly, experiments revealed a 1.5 log reduction in the total number of S. aureus on the novel nanomodified ETTs compared with the conventional ETTs after 24 hours of airflow.

Despite this, video-consultations (VC) have not been frequently used in colorectal practice. We assessed outcomes, including the economic and environmental impact of a VC clinic for new colorectal referrals. METHODS A prospective observational study, 50 consecutive patients attending a VC colorectal appointment were reviewed between March 2019 and February 2020. Face-to-face appointments during the same time period were also assessed. The distance, time, cost and carbon emissions of journeys were estimated using web-based resources. Estimated loss of earnings used data from the Office for National Statistics. The subsequent management plans were also recorded. RESULTS Of 50 patients using VC, 40 used home devices and 10 used equipment in their local medical facility. Three patients had technology difficulties and converted to telephone review. The failure to attend VC appointments was less than that for face-to-face appointment (4% versus 6.1%). VC appointments saved 6685 miles travelled (range 2-364 miles), 148 hours travelling time and £1767 cost. Additional savings for loss of earnings were approximately £33.56 per patient. Carbon emissions saved 4659 C02e lb, equivalent to over 250,000 charges of a smartphone. CONCLUSION There were significant savings related to travel, minimising time and costs for patients who choose to use the service in addition to the environmental benefits. In this current climate video consultation clinics have a central role in outpatient care for both new and follow up patients.","Sellars, H; Ramsay, G; Sunny, A; Gunner, C K; Oliphant, R; Watson, Ajm",Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland,3,27

Following the instructions is very important to achieve that. This study aimed to evaluate awareness and practices related to the COVID-19 quarantine instructions among the home quarantine COVID-19 patients, and persons who contacted them at-home quarantine. METHODS During May and June 2020, the home quarantine COVID-19 patients (mild and moderate cases who did not need to be admitted to hospital) and contacting persons were asked to fill an online structured questionnaire. Data were collected to assess the awareness regarding the quarantine instructions. The questionnaire was divided into 3 sections, consisting of 35 questions for a total possible score of 0 to 35. The first section was to assess the participants' awareness [19 items]; the second was to assess the participants' families' awareness [11 items]; the third was to assessing awareness and attitude regarding the efforts provided to face COVID-19 [5 items]. RESULTS A total of 300 subjects participated, 96% of them were committed not to leave the house till the end of the self-isolation period; 85% cared for house cleanliness and good ventilation of rooms; 63% maintained a balanced diet without fats, oil, and sugar; 70% used vitamins D and A to strengthen the immune system. The important role of the media in informing subjects of COVID-19 was known by 90%; 63% of the participants are not satisfied with the hospital services in the area where they live. The average score of this questionnaire was 28.18/35 (80.5%) about the awareness of COVID-19 quarantine instructions. CONCLUSION Home quarantine COVID-19 patients and people in close contact with them in the study had a good awareness of the home quarantine instructions. They had good knowledge about the home quarantine instructions; instructions for family members of infected patients; and awareness and attitude of the efforts provided to counter COVID-19.","Elgendy, Marwa O; Abd Elmawla, Mohamed N; Abdel Hamied, Ahmed M; El Gendy, Sara O; Abdelrahim, Mohamed E A",International journal of clinical practice,3,31

However, few studies have evaluated the association between prehemorrhage aspirin use and outcomes. This is the first nationwide analysis to evaluate the impact of long-term aspirin and anticoagulant use on outcomes after SAH. METHODS Data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS; 2006-2011) were extracted. Patients with a primary diagnosis of SAH who underwent microsurgical or endovascular aneurysm repair were included; those with a diagnosis of an arteriovenous malformation were excluded. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to calculate the adjusted odds of in-hospital mortality, a nonroutine discharge (any discharge other than to home), or a poor outcome (death, discharge to institutional care, tracheostomy, or gastrostomy) for patients with long-term aspirin or anticoagulant use. Multivariable linear regression was used to evaluate length of hospital stay. Covariates included patient age, sex, comorbidities, primary payer, NIS-SAH severity scale, intracerebral hemorrhage, cerebral edema, herniation, modality of aneurysm repair, hospital bed size, and whether the hospital was a teaching hospital. Subgroup analyses exclusively evaluated patients treated surgically or endovascularly. RESULTS The study examined 11,549 hospital admissions. Both aspirin (2.1%, n = 245) and anticoagulant users (0.9%, n = 108) were significantly older and had a greater burden of comorbid disease (p < 0.001); severity of SAH was slightly lower in those with long-term aspirin use (p = 0.03). Neither in-hospital mortality (13.5% vs 12.6%) nor total complication rates (79.6% vs 80.0%) differed significantly by long-term aspirin use. Additionally, aspirin use was associated with decreased odds of a cardiac complication (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.36%-0.91%, p = 0.02) or of venous thromboembolic events (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.30%-0.94%, p = 0.03). Length of stay was significantly shorter (15 days vs 17 days [12.73%], 95% CI 5.22%-20.24%, p = 0.001), and the odds of a nonroutine discharge were lower (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.48%-0.83%, p = 0.001) for aspirin users. In subgroup analyses, the benefits of aspirin were primarily noted in patients who underwent coil embolization; likewise, among patients treated endovascularly, the adjusted odds of a poor outcome were lower among long-term aspirin users (31.8% vs 37.4%, OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.42%-0.94%, p = 0.03). Although the crude rates of in-hospital mortality (19.4% vs 12.6%) and poor outcome (53.6% vs 37.6%) were higher for long-term anticoagulant users, in multivariable logistic regression models these variations were not significantly different (mortality: OR 1.36, 95% CI 0.89%-2.07%, p = 0.16; poor outcome: OR 1.09, 95% CI 0.69%-1.73%, p = 0.72). CONCLUSIONS In this nationwide study, neither long-term aspirin nor anticoagulant use were associated with differential mortality or complication rates after SAH. Aspirin use was associated with a shorter hospital stay and lower rates of nonroutine discharge, with these benefits primarily observed in patients treated endovascularly.","Dasenbrock, Hormuzdiyar H; Yan, Sandra C; Gross, Bradley A; Guttieres, Donovan; Gormley, William B; Frerichs, Kai U; Ali Aziz-Sultan, M; Du, Rose",Journal of neurosurgery,3,31

The 3D structure rich in alpha-helices and positively charged is particularly suited for antibacterial and antifungal activity, which is presented by many 2S albumins. However, the hypervariable region present in 2S albumins induces allergenic reactions. Because of that, 2S albumins have never been recognized for their biotechnological potential. However, the development of servers used for the rational design of antimicrobial molecules has now brought a new application to 2S albumins, acting as a model to design antimicrobial molecules without the toxic or allergenic effects of 2S albumins. Therefore, this review is focused on discussing the importance of 2S albumins to seed development and defense and the biochemical, structural and functional properties of these proteins thought to play a role in their antimicrobial activity. Additionally, the application of 2S albumins to design synthetic antimicrobial peptides is discussed, potentially bringing new functions to these forgotten proteins.","Souza, Pedro F N",International journal of biological macromolecules,3,14

Diagnostic laparoscopy was performed to verify the origin of the tumor in the pancreatic tail. In a three-port technique the tumor was mobilized of the splenic vessels until a distal pancreatectomy could be completed. Histopathological examination confirmed the complete resection of a low-grade malignant SPT. The postoperative course was unremarkable. Regular pediatric oncological follow-up examinations for 3 years, including MRI every 6 months, ruled out recurrence and confirmed preservation of splenic and pancreatic functions. While data about the technical feasibility of a laparoscopic approach to pancreatic SPT are already available, this pediatric case report adds a long-term oncological and functional success to the available literature.","ElHaddad, Ahmed; Gasparella, Paolo; Castellani, Christoph; Singer, Georg; Sorantin, Erich; Zach, Klara; Till, Holger",European journal of pediatric surgery reports,3,5

We describe a collaboration between engineers and surgeons in the United States and Uganda to develop a silo from locally available materials. METHODS Design criteria included the following: < $5 cost, 5 ± 0.25 cm opening diameter, deformability of the opening construct, ≥ 500 mL volume, ≥ 30 N tensile strength, no statistical difference in the leakage rate between the low-cost silo and preformed silo, ease of manufacturing, and reusability. Pugh scoring matrices were used to assess designs. Materials considered included the following: urine collection bags, intravenous bags, or zipper storage bags for the silo and female condom rings or O-rings for the silo opening construct. Silos were assembled with clothing irons and sewn with thread. Colleagues in Uganda, Malawi, Tanzania, and Kenya investigated material cost and availability. RESULTS Urine collection bags and female condom rings were chosen as the most accessible materials. Silos were estimated to cost < $1 in SSA. Silos yielded a diameter of 5.01 ± 0.11 cm and a volume of 675 ± 7 mL. The iron + sewn seal, sewn seal, and ironed seal on the silos yielded tensile strengths of 31.1 ± 5.3 N, 30.1 ± 2.9 N, and 14.7 ± 2.4 N, respectively, compared with the seal of the current standard-of-care silo of 41.8 ± 6.1 N. The low-cost silos had comparable leakage rates along the opening and along the seal with the spring-loaded preformed silo. The silos were easily constructed by biomedical engineering students within 15 min. All silos were able to be sterilized by submersion. CONCLUSIONS A low-cost gastroschisis silo was constructed from materials locally available in SSA. Further in vivo and clinical studies are needed to determine if mortality can be improved with this design.","Arivoli, Muthukurisil; Biswas, Arushi; Burroughs, Nolan; Wilson, Patrick; Salzman, Caroline; Kakembo, Nasser; Mugaga, Julius; Ssekitoleko, Robert T; Saterbak, Ann; Fitzgerald, Tamara N",The Journal of surgical research,3,8

The North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition (NASPGHAN) Endoscopy and Procedures Committee has formulated this statement to offer practical guidance to help standardize endoscopy services for pediatric patients with the aim of minimizing COVID-19 transmission to staff, patients, and caregivers and to conserve personal protective equipment (PPE) during this critical time. Appropriate use of PPE is essential to minimize transmission and preserve supply. Pediatric endoscopic procedures are considered at high risk for COVID-19 transmission. We recommend that all pediatric endoscopic procedures are done in a negative pressure room with all staff using proper airborne, contact, and droplet precautions regardless of patient risk stratification. This includes appropriate use of a filtering face-piece respirator (N95, N99, FFP2/3, or PAPR), double gloves, facial protection (full visor and/or face shield), full body water-resistant disposable gown, shoe covers and a hairnet. In deciding which endoscopic procedures should proceed, it is important to weigh the risks and benefits to optimize healthcare delivery and minimize risk. To inform these decisions, we propose a framework for stratifying procedures as emergent (procedures that need to PROCEEED), urgent (PAUSE, weigh the benefits and risks in deciding whether to proceed) and elective (POSTPONE procedures). This statement was based on emerging evidence and is meant as a guide. It is important that all endoscopy facilities where pediatric procedures are performed follow current recommendations from public health agencies within their jurisdiction regarding infection prevention and control of COVID-19.","Walsh, Catharine M; Fishman, Douglas S; Lerner, Diana G",Journal of pediatric gastroenterology and nutrition,3,19

Furthermore, a new, minimally invasive strategy termed 'liquid biopsy' (LB) has revolutionized the field by allowing comprehensive cancer genomic profiling through the analysis of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) released into the bloodstream. However, its detection requires extremely sensitive and efficient technologies. A powerful molecular tool based on the principle of 'divide and conquer' has emerged to solve this problem. Thus, digital PCR (dPCR) allows absolute and accurate quantification of target molecules. AREAS COVERED : In this review we will discuss the fundamentals of dPCR and the most common approaches used for partition of samples and quantification. The advantages and limitations of dPCR will be mentioned in the context of the field of LB in oncology. EXPERT OPINION In our opinion, dPCR has proven to be one of the most sensitive methods available for LB analysis, even though some aspects such as its capacity of multiplexing and protocol standardization still require further improvements. Furthermore, the increasing sensitivities and lower costs of next generation sequencing (NGS) methods position dPCR as a confirmatory and complementary technique for NGS results which will likely prove very useful for treatment monitoring and assessing minimal residual disease.","Moreno-Manuel, Andrea; Calabuig-Fariñas, Silvia; Obrador-Hevia, Antonia; Blasco, Ana; Fernández-Díaz, Amaya; Sirera, Rafael; Camps, Carlos; Jantus-Lewintre, Eloisa",Expert review of molecular diagnostics,3,1

To rationally design single-atom alloys and other surfaces with localized ensembles, it is crucial to understand variations in reactivity when varying the dopant and the ensemble size. Here, we examined hydrogen adsorption on surfaces embedded with localized clusters and discovered general trends. Counterintuitively, increasing the amount of a more reactive metal sometimes makes a surface site less reactive. This behavior is due to the hybridization and splitting of narrow peaks in the electronic density of states of many of these surfaces, making them analogous to free-standing nanoclusters. When a single-atom alloy has a peak just below the Fermi energy, the corresponding two-dopant cluster often has weaker adsorption than the single-atom alloy due to splitting of this peak across the Fermi energy. Furthermore, single-atom alloys have qualitatively different behaviors than larger ensembles. Specifically, the adsorption energy is a U-shaped function of the dopant's group for single-atom alloys. Additionally, adsorption energies on single-atom alloys correlate more strongly with the dopant's p-band center than with the d-band center.","Monasterial, Abigale P; Hinderks, Calla A; Viriyavaree, Songkun; Montemore, Matthew M",The Journal of chemical physics,3,1

Very similar results were obtained with another family of G protein-coupled receptor ligands, the bombesin family. We describe a new conjugate, RM2, with the chelator DOTA coupled to D-Phe-Gln-Trp-Ala-Val-Gly-His-Sta-Leu-NH(2) via the cationic spacer 4-amino-1-carboxymethyl-piperidine for labelling with radiometals such as (111)In and (68)Ga. METHODS RM2 was synthesized on a solid support and evaluated in vitro in PC-3 cells. IC(50) and K(d) values were determined. The antagonist potency was evaluated by immunofluorescence-based internalization and Ca(2+) mobilization assays. Biodistribution studies were performed in PC-3 and LNCaP tumour-bearing mice with (111)In-RM2 and (68)Ga-RM2, respectively. PET/CT studies were performed on PC-3 and LNCaP tumour-bearing nude mice with (68)Ga-RM2. RESULTS RM2 and (111)In-RM2 are high-affinity and selective ligands for the GRP receptor (7.7 ± 3.3 nmol/l for RM2; 9.3 ± 3.3 nmol/l for (nat)In-RM2). The potent antagonistic properties were confirmed by an immunofluorescence-based internalization and Ca(2+) mobilization assays. (68)Ga- and (111)In-RM2 showed high and specific uptake in both the tumour and the pancreas. Uptake in the tumour remained high (15.2 ± 4.8%IA/g at 1 h; 11.7 ± 2.4%IA/g at 4 h), whereas a relatively fast washout from the pancreas and the other abdominal organs was observed. Uptake in the pancreas decreased rapidly from 22.6 ± 4.7%IA/g at 1 h to 1.5 ± 0.5%IA/g at 4 h. CONCLUSION RM2 was shown to be a potent GRPr antagonist.

The present study aims to investigate the protective role of SIRT1 after CI in experimental young and aged rats and humans. Also, the study examines the possible regulatory mechanisms of neuronal death in CI settings. Immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry were used to evaluate changes in the expression of SIRT1, JNK/ERK/MAPK/AKT signaling, and pro-apoptotic caspase-3 in experimental rats and CI patients. The study findings demonstrated that, in aged experimental rats, SIRT1 activation positively influenced JNK and ERK phosphorylation and modulated neuronal survival in AKT-dependent manner. Further, the protection conferred by SIRT1 was effectively reversed by JNK inhibition and increased pro-apoptotic caspase-3 expression. In young experimental rats, SIRT1 activation decreased the phosphorylation of stress-induced JNK, ERK, caspase-3, and increased the phosphorylation of AKT after CI. Inhibition of SIRT1 reversed the protective effect of resveratrol. More importantly, in human patients, SIRT1 expression, phosphorylation of JNK/ERK/MAPK/AKT signaling and caspase-3 were up-regulated. In conclusion, SIRT1 could possibly be involved in the modulation of JNK/ERK/MAPK/AKT signaling pathway in experimental rats and humans after CI.","Teertam, Sireesh Kumar; Prakash Babu, Phanithi",Scientific reports,3,19

In this article, we present a comprehensive literature review guided by intersectionality theory to deepen our understanding of the historical role that hegemonic masculinity plays in shaping ethnic minority women's experiences of sexual assault. Final sources included were analyzed using thematic analysis. On the basis of our analyses, we identified 4 themes: social order hierarchies, ""othering"" dynamics, economic labor divisions, and negative media/mass communication depiction. Our findings contribute to our understanding of these important histories that speak to the trauma of sexual violence inflicted upon the bodies of ethnic minority women, which we can incorporate into nursing education curricula. Incorporating this knowledge would equip nurses and allied health professionals with the necessary knowledge and skills that would enable them to help patients navigate multiple systems of oppression as they engage in help seeking following a sexual assault experience. This knowledge also acknowledges rather than dismisses the historically acceptable use of sexual violence against ethnic minority women. In addition, acknowledging these histories enables us to move forward as a society in engaging in an urgently needed cultural shift to address the hegemonic masculinities that perpetuate violence against women in the United States.","Ruiz, Ashley; Luebke, Jeneile; Hawkins, Maren; Klein, Kathryn; Mkandawire-Valhmu, Lucy",ANS.

While trials are underway to manipulate the diet of people with IBD, there has been no comprehensive systematic review of the dietary intake of adults with IBD. AIMS To conduct a systematic evaluation and meta-analysis of the dietary intake of adults with IBD, including macronutrients, micronutrients and food group data. METHODS CINAHL, Embase, Medline and Scopus were searched from 1 January 2000 to 25 September 2020 for cohort, case-control or cross-sectional studies that reported usual dietary intake in adults. Data were pooled and reported as weighted mean intake for: all adults with IBD; Crohn's disease; ulcerative colitis; active disease; remission; males; females. A random-effects meta-analysis model compared intake with healthy individuals. RESULTS Forty studies were identified and 19 were included in the meta-analysis. All subgroups of adults with IBD consumed inadequate energy (mean intake in adults with IBD 1980 ± 130 kcal), fibre (14 ± 4 g), folate (246 ± 33 mg) and calcium (529 ± 114 mg) per day. Intake of breads and cereals, legumes, fruit, vegetables and dairy were inadequate. Compared to healthy individuals, adults with IBD consume significantly less dietary fibre (SMD -0.59; 95% CI: -0.73, -0.46). CONCLUSIONS This review provides improved clarity about the dietary intake of adults with IBD.

The composition of biomass feedstock and pyrolysis temperature are the major influencing factors. It is suggested that the lignocellulosic biomass is an outstanding candidate, wood and woody biomass in particular. Besides, moderate temperatures (400-700 °C) are suitable for the development of the pore structure. Further improvement can be implemented by additional treatments. Activation is the most widely used and effective way to promote biochar surface area and porosity, especially the chemical activation. Enhancement can also be achieved by using other treatment methods, such as carbonaceous materials coating, ball milling, and templating.

Current guidelines recommend against testing to identify specific viruses due to a lack of data on the benefit of such testing. This study was designed to characterize epidemiology, hospital course, and outcomes of the various common virus -related hospitalization in children. METHOD Single-center retrospective chart review. All patients who had respiratory viral panel sent within 48 h of admission. Comparative demographic and outcome analysis. Statistical analysis using ANOVA and multivariable regression. RESULT 1831 patients met the study criteria. Rhinovirus was the most common virus (55.9%). Coronavirus had the highest proportion of infants (61.2%), while influenza had the least (17.8%). Positive urine culture identified in 8.1% of patients, with blood and urine positivity at 2% each. Rhinovirus and parainfluenza were spread throughout the year, while Corona, RSV, and influenza were more predominant in winter months. Overall PICU admission rate 22.8% and was highest for RSV (28.0%) and lowest for adenovirus (13.5%). No difference in ICU length of stay among different virus. Intubation rate was 5.6% with a median duration of 5 days. Median hospital length of stay was 2 days and differ significantly with different virus (maximum four RSV and metapneumo virus). Mortality in the study population was 0.3%. CONCLUSION The difference in the disease course of different viruses may justify the resources required to test for the respiratory viral panel.

There is an emergent need for a temporary hemostatic intervention whenever surgical care is not immediately available. Our team previously described a self-expanding polyurethane foam for the treatment of exsanguinating abdominal hemorrhage. The objective of this study was to translate a safe and effective swine dose into an appropriate human dose through foam administration in recently deceased humans with representative tissue compliance. METHODS With institutional review board oversight and informed consent at three centers, terminal patients were identified. Within 3 hours of death, the abdomen was accessed, and fluid was added to simulate hemorrhage. Foam was percutaneously administered using a prototype delivery system at multiple doses (45, 55, 65, 75, and 100 mL). Intra-abdominal pressure was monitored for 15 minutes, and then, foam was removed via laparotomy to assess abdominal tissue contact. RESULTS Twenty-one recently deceased patients ranging in age from 20 years to 92 years and body mass index from 18 kg/m to 39 kg/m were enrolled in the study. Foam was administered at a mean (SD) of 146 (34) minutes after death. Three subjects were screen failures, and three subjects were excluded from the analysis because of experimental errors. Change in intra-abdominal pressure and semiquantitative organ contact were used as surrogates to compare findings between humans and swine. Doses of 45, 55, and 65 mL resulted in peak pressures of 37 (20), 28 (8.1), and 33 (20) mmHg, respectively, within the acceptable range established in swine studies. Foam deployments of 75 mL and 100 mL exceeded acceptable pressures defined in swine. Higher foam doses tended to improve contact with the diaphragm, paracolic gutters, and liver. CONCLUSION The use of recently deceased humans demonstrates a novel approach to device evaluation in representative human anatomy, particularly when tissue compliance is critical. Sixty-five milliliters was determined to be the clinically appropriate dose for foam treatment in bleeding human patients.","Mesar, Tomaz; Martin, David; Lawless, Ryan; Podbielski, Jeanette; Cook, Mackenzie; Underwood, Sam; Larentzakis, Andreas; Cotton, Bryan; Fagenholz, Peter; Schreiber, Martin; Holcomb, John B; Marini, John; Sharma, Upma; Rago, Adam P; King, David R",The journal of trauma and acute care surgery,3,25

Countrywide MTCT of HIV is estimated to be > 10,000 annually. Aims of present study are to find out the prevalence of HIV and correlates of HIV transmission among children given birth by HIV infected mother through systematic review along with meta-analysis. METHODS All avaiable articles are retrieved using MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, Science Direct, EMBASE, Google Scholar and PUBMED following guidelines for Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Joanna Briggs Institute Meta-Analysis of Statistics Assessment and Review Instrument (JBI-MAStARI) are applied to critically reviewing the selected articles. STATA 13.0 is used to preparation of forest plot for Meta-analysis. For assessment of heterogeneity and publication biases I2 statistics along with Begg and Mazumdar's test and Egger's tests are used. Odds ratio (OR) along with forest plots have been showing with 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS All together 10 studies including 1537 pairs of mothers and new births are assessed in present meta-analysis. Present analysis revealed the prevalence of HIV due to MTCT in India as 8.76% (95% CI; 5.76, 12.31). Analysis of subgroups exhibit a higher pooled prevalence in eastern region of India, 10.83% (95% CI: 5.9, 17.81) and lower in in Western region in India, 6.37% (95% CI: 4.65, 8.49). Status of MTCT before and after initiation of universal ART are 10.23% (95% CI 6.61, 14.55) and 7.93% (95% CI 4.18, 12.76) respectively. Associated factors with MTCT of HIV include absence of maternal prevention of MTCT intervention, OR = 10.82 (95% CI: 5.28, 22.17), lacking in administration of infant ARV (antiretroviral), OR = 8.21 (95% CI: 4.82, 14.0) and absence of medical facility during childbirth OR = 3.73 (95% CI: 1.67, 8.33). CONCLUSIONS In India, pooled HIV prevalence of MTCT as high as 8.78% (95% CI; 5.76, 12.31) among babies born to infected mothers warrants urgent need of focused intervention for providing ART (PMTCT intervention), ensuring proper infant ARV prophylaxis, and avoiding delivery without proper medical facility to pregnant women with HIV for reduction of occurrence in HIV transmission from mothers to children.","Bhatta, Mihir; Dutta, Nalok; Nandi, Srijita; Dutta, Shanta; Saha, Malay Kumar",BMC pregnancy and childbirth,3,1

We aimed to systematically review the prevalence, predictors of and survival from neurologic complications in patients who have undergone extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation. DATA SOURCES MEDLINE (PubMed) and six other databases (EMBASE, Cochrane Library, CINAHL Plus, Web of Science, and Scopus) from inception to August 2019. STUDY SELECTION Randomized controlled trials and observational studies in patients greater than 18 years old. DATA EXTRACTION Two independent reviewers extracted the data. Study quality was assessed by the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for randomized controlled trials, the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for cohort and case-control studies, and the Murad tool for case series. Random-effects meta-analyses were used to pool data. DATA SYNTHESIS The 78 studies included in our analysis encompassed 50,049 patients, of which 6,261 (12.5%) received extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Among extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation patients, the median age was 56 years (interquartile range, 52-59 yr), 3,933 were male (63%), 3,019 had out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (48%), and 2,289 had initial shockable heart rhythm (37%). The most common etiology of cardiac arrest was acute coronary syndrome (n = 1,657, 50% of reported). The median extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation duration was 3.2 days (interquartile range, 2.1-4.9 d). Overall, 27% (95% CI, 0.17-0.39%) had at least one neurologic complication, 23% (95% CI, 0.14-0.32%) hypoxic-ischemic brain injury, 6% (95% CI, 0.02-0.11%) ischemic stroke, 6% (95% CI, 0.01-0.16%) seizures, and 4% (95% CI, 0.01-0.1%) intracerebral hemorrhage. Seventeen percent (95% CI, 0.12-0.23%) developed brain death. The overall survival rate after extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation was 29% (95% CI, 0.26-0.33%) and good neurologic outcome was achieved in 24% (95% CI, 0.21-0.28%). CONCLUSIONS One in four patients developed acute brain injury after extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation and the most common type was hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. One in four extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation patients achieved good neurologic outcome.

Methods- STRATIS (Systematic Evaluation of Patients Treated With Neurothrombectomy Devices for Acute Ischemic Stroke) was a prospective, multicenter study of patients with large vessel occlusion treated with the Solitaire stent retriever as first-line therapy. In this study, an independent core laboratory, blinded to the clinical outcomes, reviewed all procedures and angiographic data to classify procedural technique, target clot location, recanalization after each pass, and determine the number of stent retriever passes. The primary clinical end point was functional independence (modified Rankin Scale, 0-2) at 3 months as determined on-site, and the angiographic end point was first-pass effect (FPE) success rate from a single device attempt (modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction, ≥2c) as determined by a core laboratory. Achieving modified FPE (modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction, ≥2b) was also assessed. Comparisons of clinical outcomes were made between groups and adjusted for baseline and procedural characteristics. All participating centers received institutional review board approval from their respective institutions. Results- Adjunctive technique groups included BGC (n=445), distal access catheter (n=238), and conventional guide catheter (n=62). The BGC group had a higher rate of FPE following first pass (212/443 [48%]) versus conventional guide catheter (16/62 [26%]; P=0.001) and distal access catheter (83/235 [35%]; P=0.002). Similarly, the BGC group had a higher rate of modified FPE (294/443 [66%]) versus conventional guide catheter (26/62 [42%]; P<0.001) and distal access catheter (129/234 [55%]; P=0.003). The BGC group achieved the highest rate of functional independence (253/415 [61%]) versus conventional guide catheter (23/55 [42%]; P=0.007) and distal access catheter (113/218 [52%]; P=0.027). Final revascularization and mortality rates did not differ across the groups. Conclusions- BGC use was an independent predictor of FPE, modified FPE, and functional independence, suggesting that its routine use may improve the rates of early revascularization success and good clinical outcomes.

However, many patients are unable to tolerate resection secondary to poor reserve or comorbid disease. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and microwave ablation (MWA) are methods of percutaneous thermal ablation that can be used to treat medically inoperable patients with NSCLC. We present long-term outcomes following thermal ablation of stage IA NSCLC from a single center. Methods Patients with stage IA NSCLC and factors precluding resection who underwent RFA or MWA from July 2005 to September 2009 were studied. CT and PET-CT scans were performed at 3 and 6 month intervals, respectively, for first 24 months of follow-up. Factors associated with local progression (LP) and overall survival (OS) were analyzed. Results Twenty-one patients underwent 21 RFA and 4 MWA for a total of 25 ablations. Fifteen patients had T1a and six patients had T1b tumors. Mean follow-up was 42 months, median survival was 39 months, and OS at three years was 52%. There was no significant difference in median survival between T1a nodules and T1b nodules (36 vs. 39 months, P=0.29) or for RFA and MWA (36 vs. 50 months, P=0.80). Ten patients had LP (47.6%), at a median time of 35 months. There was no significant difference in LP between T1a and T1b tumors (22 vs. 35 months, P=0.94) or RFA and MWA (35 vs. 17 months, P=0.18). Median OS with LP was 32 months compared to 39 months without LP (P=0.68). Three patients underwent repeat ablations. Mean time to LP following repeat ablation was 14.75 months. One patient had two repeat ablations and was disease free at 40-month follow-up. Conclusions Thermal ablation effectively treated or controlled stage IA NSCLC in medically inoperable patients. Three-year OS exceeded 50%, and LP did not affect OS. Therefore, thermal ablation is a viable option for medically inoperable patients with early stage NSCLC.","Narsule, Chaitan K; Sridhar, Praveen; Nair, Divya; Gupta, Avneesh; Oommen, Roy G; Ebright, Michael I; Litle, Virginia R; Fernando, Hiran C",Journal of thoracic disease,3,1

Therefore, the purpose of this study is to explore the key factors that may enhance the adoption of health-protective behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic in Morocco and India. A theoretical framework derived from the health belief model (HBM) was used for this research. Data was collected from a sample of 444 adult individuals split across Morocco (n = 215) and India (n = 229). Data analysis was carried out using two-stage multiple-analytic techniques. First, structural equation modeling (SEM) was employed to test the hypothesized relationships. Second, an artificial neural network (ANN) model was employed to rank the significant independent variables obtained from SEM analysis. The results of SEM showed that perceived benefit is the key predictor of the protective behavior in Morocco, followed by self-efficacy, and then perceived severity. By contrast, ANN analysis showed that perceived severity was the most vital factor for predicting the protective behavior in Morocco, followed by perceived benefits, and then self-efficacy. For the Indian sample, both SEM analysis and the ANN model revealed that the impact of perceived susceptibility on the adoption of the protective measure is stronger than that of cues to action. Theoretical contributions and managerial implications are also discussed toward the end.","Jadil, Yassine; Ouzir, Mounir",Environmental research,3,1

We conducted a single-arm multicenter phase II clinical trial to evaluate the safety and the feasibility of laparoscopic total gastrectomy for clinical stage I proximal gastric cancer in terms of postoperative morbidity and mortality in Korea. The secondary endpoint of this trial was comparison of surgical outcomes among the groups that received different methods of esophagojejunostomy (EJ). METHODS The 160 patients of the full analysis set group were divided into three groups according to the method of EJ, the extracorporeal circular stapling group (EC; n = 45), the intracorporeal circular stapling group (IC; n = 64), and the intracorporeal linear stapling group (IL; n = 51). The clinicopathologic characteristics and the surgical outcomes were compared among these three groups. RESULTS There were no significant differences in the early complication rates among the three groups (26.7% vs. 18.8% vs. 17.6%, EC vs. IC vs. IL; p = 0.516). The length of mini-laparotomy incision was significantly longer in the EC group than in the IC or IL group. The anastomosis time was significantly shorter in the EC group than in the IL group. The time to first flatus was significantly shorter in the IL group than in the EC group. The long-term complication rate was not significantly different among the three groups (4.4% vs. 12.7% vs. 7.8%; EC vs. IC vs. IL; p = 0.359), however, the long-term incidence of EJ stenosis in IC group (10.9%) was significantly higher than in EC (0%) and IL (2.0%) groups (p = 0.020). CONCLUSIONS The extracorporeal circular stapling and the intracorporeal linear stapling were safe and feasible in laparoscopic total gastrectomy, however, intracorporeal circular stapling increased EJ stenosis.","Yang, Han-Kwang; Hyung, Woo Jin; Han, Sang-Uk; Lee, Young-Jun; Park, Joong-Min; Cho, Gyu Seok; Kwon, Oh Kyoung; Kong, Seong-Ho; Kim, Hyoung-Il; Lee, Hyuk-Joon; Kim, Wook; Ryu, Seung Wan; Jin, Sung-Ho; Oh, Sung Jin; Ryu, Keun Won; Kim, Min-Chan; Ahn, Hye Seong; Park, Young Kyu; Kim, Yong Ho; Hwang, Sun-Hwi; Kim, Jong Won; Kim, Jin-Jo",Surgical endoscopy,3,16

Therefore rationing is an inevitable occurrence in medicine and in critical care where the potential demand for effective medical care will exceed supply. Although there are many strategies to allocate medical resources one that is often considered is based on cost-effectiveness. Cost-effectiveness analysis attempts to estimate the value of individual medical treatments in terms of dollars and outcomes. Allocation of medical treatments based on cost-effectiveness analysis requires valid estimates of both the costs and the effectiveness of treatments as well as some overarching body with the authority to enforce allocation based on these analyses. Limitations of allocation based on cost-effectiveness analysis in critical care include difficulties in estimating marginal costs of critical care treatments, limited evidence for any treatments with efficacy, and the ethical principle of rescuing identifiable lives in imminent risk of death. The prospect of a pandemic influenza-like infection has stimulated a lot of interest in hypothetical rationing strategies for the intensive care unit, none of which has been tested in actual pandemic scenarios. Given the burden of critical illness and the wide variation in resources a global approach to rationing is untenable. The article concludes with a vision of the future of allocation in critical care.","Rubenfeld, Gordon D",Seminars in respiratory and critical care medicine,3,1

Modern technology including novel oxygenation modalities, widespread availability of capnography, second-generation supraglottic airway devices and videolaryngoscopy provide the tools to make airway management safer still. However, technology will only take safety so far, and non-technical aspects of airway management are critically important for communication and decision making during airway crises, acknowledging a 'cannot intubate, cannot oxygenate' situation and transitioning to emergency front of neck airway.

This appears to be a particular limitation for uridine-based nucleosides. Our ProTide method allows the direct use of masked membrane-soluble preformed nucleoside phosphates, bypassing the need for the initial phosphorylation step. We herein applied it to some novel 5-trimethylsilyl arabinosyl uridines. METHODS 5-Trimethylsilyl-1-beta-D-(arabinofuranosyl)uracil was prepared in six steps starting from uridine, and five phosphoramidate ProTide derivatives were synthesized. These compounds were investigated for activity against a range of DNA and RNA viruses, including herpes simplex virus type-1 and type-2, vaccinia virus and HIV. RESULTS Overall, these compounds did not show significant antiviral activity against any of the viruses tested. CONCLUSIONS The inactivity of the ProTides of this nucleoside could correspond with poor ProTide activation in vitro, poor onward metabolism or low activity of the putative monophosphate metabolite.","Mehellou, Youcef; Balzarini, Jan; McGuigan, Christopher",Antiviral chemistry & chemotherapy,3,1

This study aimed to determine if high-speed electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is able to detect conductivity changes associated with cyclic blood-volume changes and to gauge the potential of using these signatures to differentiate malignant from benign regions within the breast. EIT imaging of pulsating latex membranes submerged in saline baths provided initial validation of its use for tracking temporally varying conductivities. Nineteen women (10 with cancer, nine without) were imaged with EIT over the course of several heartbeats in synchrony with pulse-oximetry acquisition. Eight parameters ( rs, ϕ(rt,max), rt,max, Plow:full, Phigh:full, Plow:high) relating the conductivity images and pulse-oximeter signatures were extracted and used as a means of comparing malignant and benign regions of the breast. Significant differences between malignant and benign regions of interest were noted in seven of the eight parameters. The maximum correlation between conductivity and pulse-oximeter signals, rt,max , was observed to be the optimal discriminating parameter with a receiver operating characteristic area under the curve of 0.8 and a specificity of 81% at a sensitivity of 77%. Assessing the dynamic conductivity of breast may provide additional clinical utility to that of standard imaging modalities, but further investigation is necessary to better understand the biophysical mechanisms leading to the observed conductivity changes.","Halter, Ryan J; Hartov, Alex; Poplack, Steven P; diFlorio-Alexander, Roberta; Wells, Wendy A; Rosenkranz, Kari M; Barth, Richard J; Kaufman, Peter A; Paulsen, Keith D",IEEE transactions on medical imaging,3,1

Methods From a registry database, 194 consecutive patients with acute BA occlusion who underwent EVT were analyzed. Stroke mechanism, classified into in situ atherosclerotic thrombosis (ISAT) and embolism, clot sign location profiles in pre-angiography magnetic resonance image (MRI), parameters of angiography and EVT, and reperfusion were assessed. Poor outcome was defined as a modified Rankin-Scale score at 90 days of 3-6. Results The mean age was 68.8±11.8 years (range 21-92 years) and seventy-eight (40.2%) were female patients. 102 (52.6%) patients were classified into an embolism mechanism and 92 (47.4%) into an ISAT mechanism. Overall, ISAT mechanism compared with embolism was significantly associated with poor outcomes (P = 0.002), along with the NIHSS scores, reperfusion status, and collateral status. In the embolism group, reperfusion (P = 0.001), NIHSS scores (P < 0.001), and onset-to-treatment time (P = 0.030) were significant outcome factors. However, in the ISAT group, baseline collateral status (P = 0.001) and NIHSS scores (P < 0.001) were significant outcome factors. A clot sign at the distal BA segment on pre-angiography MRI was strongly associated with embolism mechanism (P < 0.001). Interpretation Stroke mechanism has a major influence on outcomes, and outcome predictors differ according to the underlying mechanism in acute BA occlusion with EVT. Clot sign profile on pre-angiography MRI might be useful to determine the underlying mechanism.","Lee, Woo-Jin; Jung, Keun-Hwa; Ryu, Young Jin; Kim, Jeong-Min; Lee, Soon-Tae; Chu, Kon; Kim, Manho; Lee, Sang Kun; Sohn, Chul-Ho; Roh, Jae-Kyu",Annals of clinical and translational neurology,3,1

Despite the repurposing of older treatments and the novel antimicrobials, many resistance mechanisms cannot be confronted, and novel therapies are needed. AREAS COVERED We searched the literature for keywords regarding the treatment of GNB infections in mechanically ventilated patients. This narrative review presents new data on antibiotics and non-antibiotic approaches focusing on Phase 3 trials against clinically significant GNB that cause VAP. EXPERT OPINION Ceftazidime-avibactam, meropenem-vaborbactam, and imipenem-relebactam stand out as new options for infections by Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing bacteria, whereas ceftolozane-tazobactam adds therapeutic flexibility in Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections with multiple resistance mechanisms. Ceftazidime-avibactam and ceftolozane-tazobactam have a literature base about VAP. Aztreonam-avibactam holds promise for the treatment of infections by metallo-β-lactamase (MBL)-producing organisms. Recently approved cefiderocol possesses an extended antibacterial spectrum, including, among others, KPC- and MBL-producers. However, recently published data have toned down optimism about treating VAP caused by carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. For the latter, eravacycline may provide additional hope, pending pertinent data. Non-antibiotic treatments currently being considered as adjunct therapeutic approaches are welcome. Nevertheless, they will hopefully substitute current antimicrobials in the future.","Karvouniaris, Marios; Pontikis, Konstantinos; Nitsotolis, Thomas; Poulakou, Garyphallia",Expert review of anti-infective therapy,3,17

SARS-CoV-2/HHV-6 co-infection has been emphasized in previous works, mostly case reports, small series or epidemiological studies, but few is known about its real clinical outcomes. Here we present a real-world pilot study aiming to understand the frequency and the clinical impact of HHV-6 co-infection in moderate to critically ill patients hospitalized due to COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 and HHV-6 were evaluated in nasopharyngeal samples at the hospital admission of suspected COVID-19 patients. From 173 consecutive cases, 60 were SARS-CoV-2 positive and 13/60 (21.7%) were HHV-6 positive, after identified as the HHV-6B species by a Sanger sequencing. The SARS-CoV-2+/HHV-6+ group was younger but no significant for cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, obesity and cancer, but significant among therapeutic immunosuppressed patients (as systemic lupus erythematous and kidney transplant patients). In the medical records, only sparse data on cutaneous or neurological manifestations were found. Biochemical and hematological data showed only a trend towards hyperferritinemic status and lymphopenia. In conclusion, despite of the impressive high frequency of HHV-6 co-infection in SARS-CoV-2 positive cases, it did not impact general mortality. We suggest larger future prospective studies to better elucidate the influence of HHV-6 reactivation in cases of COVID-19, designed to specific assessment of clinical outcomes and viral reactivation mechanisms.

Evidence is defined as an outward sign or something that furnishes proof. Evidence in medicine is not limited to direct, blinded comparisons of one form of treatment compared with another but rather the body of knowledge that provides insight to clinicians to offer patient care. Evidence-based medicine follows from information available to form the foundation for the use of a treatment for a specific disease. Reports of strategies of thrombus removal for acute DVT, especially in patients with iliofemoral DVT, consistently demonstrate improved outcomes relative to postthrombotic morbidity.

Musical performance in particular features precise timing and depends on the differentiation and coordination of musical/social roles. Here, we study the influence of musical/social roles, individual musicians and different ensembles on rhythmic synchronization in Malian drum ensemble music, which features synchronization accuracy near the limits of human performance. We analysed 72 recordings of the same piece performed by four trios, in which two drummers in each trio systematically switched roles (lead versus accompaniment). Musical role, rather than individual or group differences, is the main factor influencing synchronization accuracy. Using linear causal modelling, we found a consistent pattern of bi-directional couplings between players, in which the direction and strength of rhythmic adaptation is asymmetrically distributed across musical roles. This differs from notions of musical leadership, which assume that ensemble synchronization relies predominantly on a single dominant personality and/or musical role. We then ran simulations that varied the direction and strength of sensorimotor coupling and found that the coupling pattern used by the Malian musicians affords nearly optimal synchronization. More broadly, our study showcases the importance of ecologically valid and culturally diverse studies of human behaviour.

Another interesting approach would be the use of GRPR radioligands for pre-operative imaging and subsequent radio-guided surgery, with the goal to improve surgical outcome. GRPR radioligands were successfully implemented in clinical studies, especially Sarabesin 3 (SB3) is an appealing GRPR antagonist with high receptor affinity. Gallium-68 labeled SB3 has good in vivo stability, after labeling with Indium-111; however, the molecule shows poor in vivo stability, which negatively impacts tumor-targeting capacity. A novel approach to increase in vivo stability of radiopeptides is by co-administration of the neutral endopeptidase (NEP) inhibitor, phosphoramidon (PA). We studied in vivo stability and biodistribution of [111In]SB3 without/with (-/+) PA in mice. Furthermore, SPECT/MRI on a novel, state-of-the-art platform was performed. PROCEDURES GRPR affinity of SB3 was determined on PC295 xenograft sections using [125I]Tyr4-bombesin with tracer only or with increasing concentrations of SB3. For in vivo stability, mice were injected with 200/2000 pmol [111In]SB3 -/+ 300 μg PA. Blood was collected and analyzed. Biodistribution and SPECT/MRI studies were performed at 1, 4, and 24 h postinjection (p.i.) of 2.5 MBq/200 pmol or 25 MBq/200 pmol [111In]SB3 -/+ 300 μg PA in PC-3-xenografted mice. RESULTS SB3 showed high affinity for GRPR (IC50 3.5 nM). Co-administration of PA resulted in twice higher intact peptide in vivo vs [111In]SB3 alone. Biodistribution studies at 1, 4, and 24 h p.i. show higher tumor uptake values with PA co-administration (19.7 ± 3.5 vs 10.2 ± 1.5, 17.6 ± 5.1 vs 8.3 ± 1.1, 6.5 ± 3.3 vs 3.1 ± 1.9 % ID/g tissue (P < 0.0001)). Tumor imaging with SPECT/MRI clearly improved after co-injection of PA. CONCLUSIONS Co-administration of PA increased in vivo tumor targeting capacity of [111In]SB3, making this an attractive combination for GRPR-targeted tumor imaging.","Bakker, Ingrid L; van Tiel, Sandra T; Haeck, Joost; Doeswijk, Gabriela N; de Blois, Erik; Segbers, Marcel; Maina, Theodosia; Nock, Berthold A; de Jong, Marion; Dalm, Simone U",Molecular imaging and biology : MIB : the official publication of the Academy of Molecular Imaging,3,1

Collagen/chitosan (Col/CT) blends emerge as biomaterials that meet the mechanical and biological requirements associated with bone tissue. In this work, we optimize the osteogenic effect of 3D microstructures by their functionalization with Col/CT blends with different blending ratios. The structures were fabricated by laser direct writing via two-photons polymerization of IP-L780 photopolymer. They comprised of hexagonal and ellipsoidal units 80 µm in length, 40 µm in width and 14 µm height, separated by 20 µm pillars. Structures' functionalization was achieved via dip coating in Col/CT blends with specific blending ratios. The osteogenic role of Col/CT functionalization of the 3D structures was confirmed by biological assays concerning the expression of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and osteocalcin secretion as osteogenic markers and Alizarin Red (AR) as dye for mineral deposits in osteoblast-like cells seeded on the structures. The structures having ellipsoidal units showed the best results, but the trends were similar for both ellipsoidal and hexagonal units. The strongest osteogenic effect was obtained for Col/CT blending ratio of 20/80, as demonstrated by the highest ALP activity, osteocalcin secretion and AR staining intensity in the seeded cells compared to all the other samples.","Păun, Irina Alexandra; Mustăciosu, Cosmin Cătălin; Popescu, Roxana Cristina; Călin, Bogdan Ştefăniţă; Mihăilescu, Mona",International journal of molecular sciences,3,19

METHODS Serum concentrations of IFX and antibodies to IFX (ATIs) were measured in patients with IBD at a single center using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and radioimmunoassay. Patient, disease, and treatment characteristics were retrospectively collected along with laboratory values. Pharmacokinetics and ATI titer were analyzed simultaneously by nonlinear mixed-effects modeling. RESULTS Nine hundred ninety-seven IFX concentrations and 756 ATI measurements from 332 patients with IBD (253 Crohn's disease and 79 ulcerative colitis) were included. Mean (SD) IFX dose was 5.47 ± 1.33 mg/kg. ATIs were detected in 75/332 (23%) patients; insufficient exposure below an IFX trough level of 3 μg/mL was the most predictive factor of developing ATI and resulted in a 4-fold increased risk of ATI development. ATI titer was a better predictor of IFX clearance than ATI as a dichotomous parameter. ATI titers >30 AU/mL were consistently associated with undetectable IFX concentrations. IFX clearance was affected by body weight (40-149 kg) ranging from 0.27 to 0.53 L/d, serum albumin (2-5.4 g/dL) from 0.93 to 0.24 L/d, and titers of ATIs (0-53,000 AU/mL) from 0.36 L/d to 15.93 L/d (P < 0.001). Previously biologic-treated patients exhibited a higher clearance of IFX. CONCLUSIONS IFX exposure below 3 μg/mL increases risk of ATIs. Identification of influential pharmacokinetics and ATI factors improves prediction of IFX levels, potentially allowing individualized dosing and cost reduction.","Brandse, Johannan F; Mould, Diane; Smeekes, Oscar; Ashruf, Yaël; Kuin, Sabine; Strik, Anne; van den Brink, Gijs R; DʼHaens, Geert R",Inflammatory bowel diseases,3,12

The anterior tip of the tongue has very small somatosensory receptive fields, comparable to those of the finger tips, allowing for precise two-point discrimination and high tactile sensitivity. However, perception of electrotactile stimuli varies significantly between users, and across the tongue surface. Despite this, previous studies all used uniform electrode grids to stimulate a region of the dorsal-medial tongue surface. In an effort to customize electrode layouts for individual users, and thus improve efficacy for sensory substitution applications, we investigated whether specific neuroanatomical and physiological features of the tongue are associated with enhanced ability to perceive active electrodes. Specifically, the study described here was designed to test whether fungiform papillae density and/or propylthiouracil sensitivity are positively or negatively associated with perceived intensity and/or discrimination ability for lingual electrotactile stimuli. Fungiform papillae number and distribution were determined for 15 participants and they were exposed to patterns of electrotactile stimulation (ETS) and asked to report perceived intensity and perceived number of stimuli. Fungiform papillae number and distribution were then compared to ETS characteristics using comprehensive and rigorous statistical analyses. Our results indicate that fungiform papillae density is correlated with enhanced discrimination ability for electrical stimuli. In contrast, papillae density, on average, is not correlated with perceived intensity of active electrodes. However, results for at least one participant suggest that further research is warranted. Our data indicate that propylthiouracil taster status is not related to ETS perceived intensity or discrimination ability. These data indicate that individuals with higher fungiform papillae number and density in the anterior medial tongue region may be better able to use lingual ETS for sensory substitution.","Allison, Tyler S; Moritz, Joel; Turk, Philip; Stone-Roy, Leslie M",PloS one,3,1

Herein, a novel single-line-based LFA (sLFA) strip, which combines test and control line, is developed by exploiting an orthogonal emissive upconversion nanoparticle (UCNP) as a signal reporter on the test line, where one emission can be used as a reporting signal and the other as a calibrating signal. This UCNP-based test line with an interior reference also can play a validating role as a control line, and hence capturing antibodies are not needed for control lines, greatly saving fabrication costs. As a proof-of-concept, this novel sLFA strip is successfully explored to accurately and rapidly detect aflatoxin B1. Moreover, due to the removal of control lines, such a novel strategy greatly reduces the strip size, facilitating the design of a testing array for multiple detections of different samples. The test line herein is designed in a ring shape, and several test rings are assembled to be a chip for the testing of multiple samples. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of single-line-based LFA strips, which will significantly improve the detection capacities and accuracies and reduce the testing costs of LFA strips in real sample applications ranging from food analysis to in vitro diagnostics.","Guo, Xinran; Yuan, Yun; Liu, Jinliang; Fu, Shuai; Zhang, Jing; Mei, Qingsong; Zhang, Yong",Analytical chemistry,3,1

Recently, several lines of evidence pointed to the fact that oncogenic activation of Myc family proteins is concomitant with reprogramming of tumor cells to cope with an enhanced need for metabolites during cell growth. These adaptions are driven by the ability of Myc proteins to act as transcriptional amplifiers in a tissue-of-origin specific manner. Here, we describe the effects of N-Myc overexpression on metabolic reprogramming in neuroblastoma cells. Ectopic expression of N-Myc induced a glycolytic switch that was concomitant with enhanced sensitivity towards 2-deoxyglucose, an inhibitor of glycolysis. Moreover, global metabolic profiling revealed extensive alterations in the cellular metabolome resulting from overexpression of N-Myc. Limited supply with either of the two main carbon sources, glucose or glutamine, resulted in distinct shifts in steady-state metabolite levels and significant changes in glutathione metabolism. Interestingly, interference with glutamine-glutamate conversion preferentially blocked proliferation of N-Myc overexpressing cells, when glutamine levels were reduced. Thus, our study uncovered N-Myc induction and nutrient levels as important metabolic master switches in neuroblastoma cells and identified critical nodes that restrict tumor cell proliferation.","Tjaden, Britta; Baum, Katharina; Marquardt, Viktoria; Simon, Mareike; Trajkovic-Arsic, Marija; Kouril, Theresa; Siebers, Bettina; Lisec, Jan; Siveke, Jens T; Schulte, Johannes H; Benary, Uwe; Remke, Marc; Wolf, Jana; Schramm, Alexander",Scientific reports,3,8

In the present study we describe a novel protective immuno-modulatory function of CAP in inflammation. Among the three members of the Sorbs family of adapter molecules, which include CAP (Sorbs1), ArgBP2 (Sorbs2), and Vinexin (Sorbs3), CAP consistently down-regulated the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in mouse fibroblasts, cardiomyocytes, and myeloid-derived leukocytes, after Toll-like receptor (TLR) stimulation. Upon the same TLR stimulation, ArgBP2 partially down-regulated pro-inflammatory cytokine production in mouse fibroblasts and cardiomyocytes, while Vinexin rather promoted their production. Mechanistically, CAP limited pro-inflammatory cytokine expression by suppressing the phosphorylation of Inhibitor of kappa B (IκB) kinase (Iκκ)-α and Iκκ-β and their downstream NF-κB-dependent signalling pathway. Molecular affinity between CAP and Iκκ-α/ Iκκ-β was necessary to block the NF-κB pathway. The CAP-dependent inhibitory mechanism - in vivo exclusively IL-6 inhibition - was confirmed after collecting blood from mice with systemic inflammation induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and in the heart tissue collected from mice infected with the cardiotropic Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3). Taken together, CAP down-regulates pro-inflammatory cytokines by interfering with the normal function of the NF-κB pathway. The promotion of CAP production could support the development of new strategies aiming to limit excessive and detrimental activation of the immune system.","Vdovenko, Daria; Bachmann, Marta; Wijnen, Winandus J; Hottiger, Michael O; Eriksson, Urs; Valaperti, Alan",International immunopharmacology,3,16

Risk of bias was assessed using the National Institute of Heath quality assessment tools.Study sample: After rejecting more than 2300 records, there were five case reports and two cross-sectional studies that met the inclusion criteria.Results: No records of audio-vestibular symptoms were reported with the earlier types of coronavirus (i.e. severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS] and Middle East respiratory syndrome [MERS]). Reports of hearing loss, tinnitus, and vertigo have rarely been reported in individuals who tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2.Conclusion: Reports of audio-vestibular symptoms in confirmed COVID-19 cases are few, with mostly minor symptoms, and the studies are of poor quality. Emphasis over time is likely to shift from life-threatening concerns to longer-term health-related consequences such as audio-vestibular dysfunction.

METHODS A prospective randomized controlled trial was conducted from December 2014 to February 2016 in donors scheduled for left donor nephrectomy. Donor and recipient demographics and clinical outcomes including pain scores and questionnaires (BIQ: body image questionnaire, SF-36, patient-reported overall convalescence) were also compared. RESULTS A total of 121 eligible donors were recruited, of which 99 donors who were scheduled to undergo an operation on their left side were randomized into LESSOP-DN (n = 50) and MLDN (n = 49) groups. There were no significant demographic differences between the two groups. The renal extraction time in the LESS-DN group was shorter than that in the MLDN group (75.89 ± 13.01 vs. 87.31 ± 11.38 min, p < 0.001). Other perioperative parameters and complication rates were comparable between the two groups. The LESSOP-DN group had a smaller incision length than the MLDN group (4.89 ± 0.68 vs. 6.21 ± 1.11 cm, p < 0.001), but cosmetic scores and body image scores were similar in the two groups (p = 0.905, 0.217).

We performed a systematic review of the efficacy and safety endpoints between conservative and active treatment approaches for non-trunk BAPAs. METHODS Major databases were analyzed for relevant publications between 1995 and 2019. Studies comparing the outcomes between conservative and active treatment approaches such as coiling, stenting, clipping, liquid embolization, and flow diversion were included. Mortality rate, rate of permanent neurological deficit as determined by the modified Rankin Score (mRS), rate of second treatment occurrence, and perioperative complication rate were also assessed. RESULTS A total of 24 studies, including 54 patients with 56 non-trunk BAPAs, were included. The mean maximum aneurysm diameter was 2.70 mm (range 1-10). A diagnosis was achieved with the initial DSA in 50.0% (27/54) of the patients. A conservative approach was used in 16 patients while active treatment was used in the other 38. Thirteen of 15 (86.7%) patients in the conservative group and 27/34 (79.4%) in the active treatment group had an mRS score 0-2. A non-significant higher odds of a positive outcome was observed in the conservative group (OR 1.51, 95% CI 0.50 to 4.54). The event-related mortality rate was 3.55% (3/54) with one procedure-related death in the active treatment group. CONCLUSIONS In patients with non-trunk BAPAs unamenable to active treatment, conservative approaches may result in acceptable functional outcomes and low morbidity. Small sample sizes and under-reporting of outcomes warrant further study.","Granja, Manuel F; Monteiro, Andre; Agnoletto, Guilherme Jose; Jamal, Sara; Sauvageau, Eric; Aghaebrahim, Amin; Hanel, Ricardo",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,3,1

The braided mesh structure of flow-diverting stents with a relatively small strut size can create abnormally high shear stress while arterial blood flows through the stent struts into the aneurysm, and flow-diverting stent may be associated with reduced von Willebrand factor activity. MATERIALS AND METHODS Aneurysmal morphologic parameters and patient data were examined retrospectively among patients who had an unruptured intracranial aneurysm treated with a flow-diverting stent. The RISTOtest (test for whole blood ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation) for von Willebrand factor activity, as well as tests for aspirin and clopidogrel/prasugrel effectiveness, were performed immediately before the endovascular procedure and 24 hours later by multiple electrode aggregometry. RESULTS A total of 39 patients with 56 aneurysms were recruited, and statistical analyses were performed in 32 patents with 49 aneurysms. Compared with the baseline values, von Willebrand factor activity was reduced in 16 patients but increased in 23 patients. Aneurysmal variables (eg, neck area, volume, volume-to-neck area ratio, size ratio, and morphologic index) clearly distinguished patients with reduced von Willebrand factor activity from those with nonreduced von Willebrand factor activity. The receiver operating characteristic curve showed that the morphologic index and volume had the highest discriminative power, with an area under the curve of 0.99. CONCLUSIONS In high-volume/large-neck aneurysms, flow-diverting stent implantation can cause reduced von Willebrand factor activity, which may be linked causally to acquired von Willebrand disease.","Oran, I; Cinar, C; Bozkaya, H; Parildar, M; Duman, S",AJNR.

METHODS A comprehensive search in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews retrieved all Cochrane SRs directly related to measures for controlling COVID-19 dissemination. The main characteristics and results of all the SRs included were summarized and discussed. RESULTS Three Cochrane SRs were included in the qualitative synthesis. These evaluated population-based and individual measures for controlling the dissemination of COVID-19. CONCLUSION Low-certainty evidence shows that quarantine for people exposed to confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases prevented 44% to 81% of incident cases and 31% to 63% of deaths, compared with situations of no measures. Moreover, the sooner the quarantine measures were implemented, the greater the cost savings were. High-confidence evidence showed that clear communication about infection control and prevention guidelines was vital for successful implementation. Low-certainty evidence showed that healthcare professionals with long gowns were less exposed to contamination than were those using coveralls. In addition, coveralls were more difficult to doff.

The Pockit dengue virus reagent set (GeneReach Biotech), a reverse transcription insulated isothermal PCR (RT-iiPCR), is available to detect all four serotypes of DENV on the field-deployable Pockit system, which is ready for on-site applications. In this study, analytical and clinical performances of the assay were evaluated. The index assay did not react with 14 non-DENV human viruses, indicating good specificity. Compared to the U.S. CDC DENV-1-4 real-time quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) assay, testing with serial dilutions of virus-spiked human sera demonstrated that the index assay had detection endpoints that were separately comparable with the 4 serotypes. Excellent reproducibility was observed among repeat tests done by six operators at three sites. In clinical performance, 195 clinical sera collected around Kaohsiung city in 2012 and 21 DENV-4-spiked sera were tested with the RT-iiPCR and qRT-PCR assays in parallel.

Butyrate has also shown promise in the treatment of intestinal disorders and diseases such as short bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, and colon cancer. To modify sensory properties, intestinal release, and butyrate production capabilities, tributyrin (TB) was microencapsulated in whey protein isolate (WPI)-based and gamma-cyclodextrin (GC)-based materials. Using an in vitro digestion and fermentation model, microcapsules containing TB were monitored for their release and production of butyrate in vitro. All samples containing TB showed limited butyrate release (<5%) during oral and gastric stages. In the small intestinal phase, all microcapsules containing TB released approximately 75% of their total butyrate with no significant differences (P > 0.05) across formulations. During the fermentation phase, GC-based microcapsules produced significantly more butyrate (P < 0.001) on a molar basis than all WPI-based microcapsules. Butyrate production increased significantly (P < 0.001) over each time interval with GC-based microcapsules having the highest during the 12 h of fermentation. The GC-based TB encapsulation systems were able to effectively deliver butyrate to the small intestine and generate butyrate in the large intestine.

In medical applications, curating such datasets is not a favourable option because acquiring a large number of annotated samples from experts is time-consuming and expensive. Consequently, numerous methods have been proposed in the literature for learning with limited annotated examples. Unfortunately, the proposed approaches in the literature have not yet yielded significant gains over random data augmentation for image segmentation, where random augmentations themselves do not yield high accuracy. In this work, we propose a novel task-driven data augmentation method for learning with limited labeled data where the synthetic data generator, is optimized for the segmentation task. The generator of the proposed method models intensity and shape variations using two sets of transformations, as additive intensity transformations and deformation fields. Both transformations are optimized using labeled as well as unlabeled examples in a semi-supervised framework.

It assesses three key aspects of the construct: a) agreement on the tasks of therapy; b) agreement on the therapeutic goals; and c) development of an affective bond. OBJECTIVE To preliminarily analyze the psychometric properties of the Brazilian version of both the original, 36-item WAI, and of the short form revised, 16-item version (WAI-SR). METHODS The sample comprised 201 psychodynamic psychotherapy patients. Alliance assessments were made after the 4th treatment session. RESULTS The inventory adapted to Brazilian Portuguese, in both the original and short forms, appears to be reliable and valid to measure alliance and its dimensions by clients in psychotherapy. Further studies are needed to replicate and expand the findings.","Serralta, Fernanda Barcellos; Benetti, Silvia Pereira da Cruz; Laskoski, Pricilla Braga; Abs, Daniel",Trends in psychiatry and psychotherapy,3,8

However, the placement of synthetic mesh intraperitoneally may potentially lead to mesh-induced complications such as adhesive intestinal obstruction, enterocutaneous fistula, or even mesh erosion into organs. Inspired by the concept of laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair, we developed a novel technique: preperitoneal onlay mesh repair (PPOM). This involves placing the mesh in the preperitoneal plane to help eliminate mesh-induced complications. MATERIAL AND SURGICAL TECHNIQUE Our first case of PPOM was performed on a 54-year-old woman who developed a complex incisional hernia after multiple abdominal operations. The total size of the hernia defect was 8 × 13 cm. The peritoneal flap was carefully created with synthetic mesh placed on the preperitoneal plane, and then it was completely closed with sutures. The patient had an uneventful recovery except for a small seroma. DISCUSSION We herein report the first case of incisional hernia successfully treated by this novel technique, PPOM. We explain the reasons to perform PPOM, the advantages it offers, and why we named this novel technique ""PPOM.""","Yang, Pc George; Tung, Lm Karen",Asian journal of endoscopic surgery,3,24

In particular, two classification systems have been proposed: clinical classification, comprising primary (P-CIS), concomitant (C-CIS), and secondary (S-CIS) disease, and pathological classification, comprising P-CIS, cTa-CIS, and cT1-CIS. The aim of the present study was to assess the impact of both classifications on BCG response, recurrence-free survival (RFS), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and cancer-specific survival (CSS). PATIENTS AND METHODS We performed a retrospective analysis of 386 patients with bladder CIS, with or without associated cTa/cT1 disease, treated with BCG instillations between 2008 and 2015. Patients were stratified according to the two classification systems. Cox multivariate regression models were used to assess the impact of these subtypes on BCG response, RFS, PFS, OS, and CSS. We also performed a cumulative meta-analysis according to PRISMA guidelines. RESULTS The median follow-up was 70.5 months. According to the clinical classification, 34 (8.8%) patients had P-CIS, 81 (21%) S-CIS, and 271 (70.2%) C-CIS. The pathological classification showed 34 (8.8%) patients to have P-CIS, 190 (49.2%) cTa-CIS, and 162 (42%) cT1-CIS. In the overall cohort, BCG response was reported in 296 (76.7%); 159 (41.2%) had recurrence, 55 (14.2%) had progression, and 67 (17.4%) underwent radical cystectomy. Death from any cause was recorded in 135 (35%) and death from urothelial carcinoma in 38 (9.9%). Cox multivariate regression analysis showed that neither clinical classification nor pathological classification is an independent predictive factor for BCG response, RFS, PFS, OS, or CSS after adjusting for confounders. In the pooled meta-analysis, two studies and the present series were included for evidence synthesis, recruiting a total of 941 patients. We found no statistically significant difference across the groups for both classifications with respect to BCG response, RFS, PFS, and CSS. CONCLUSIONS Currently, the supporting evidence for an impact of clinical classification and pathological classification on oncological outcomes of CIS of the bladder is insufficient to justify their use to guide clinical management or follow-up.","Subiela, José Daniel; Faba, Óscar Rodríguez; Aumatell, Julia; Krajewski, Wojciech; Calderón, Julio; Parada, Rubén; Huguet, Jorge; Algaba, Ferran; Breda, Alberto; Palou, Joan",Urologic oncology,3,9

This study assessed central and peripheral fatigue after self-paced exercise of different durations. METHODS Thirteen well-trained male cyclists completed 4-, 20-, and 40-km simulated time trials (TTs). Pre- and immediately post-TT (<2.5 min), twitch responses from the knee extensors to electrical stimulation of the femoral nerve and transcranial magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex were recorded to assess neuromuscular and corticospinal function. RESULTS Time to complete 4-, 20-, and 40-km TTs was 6.0 ± 0.2, 31.8 ± 1.0, and 65.8 ± 2.2 min at average exercise intensities of 96%, 92%, and 87% of maximum oxygen uptake, respectively. Exercise resulted in significant reductions in maximum voluntary contraction, with no difference between TTs (-18%, -15%, and -16% for 4-, 20-, and 40-km TTs, respectively). Greater peripheral fatigue was evident after 4-km (40% reduction in potentiated twitch) compared with that after 20-km (31%) and 40-km TTs (29%). In contrast, longer TTs were characterized by more central fatigue, with greater reductions in voluntary activation measured by motor nerve (-11% and -10% for 20- and 40-km TTs vs -7% for 4-km TTs) and cortical stimulation (-12% and -10% for 20- and 40-km vs -6% for 4-km). CONCLUSIONS These data demonstrate that fatigue after self-paced exercise is task dependent, with a greater degree of peripheral fatigue after shorter higher-intensity (6 min) TTs and more central fatigue after longer lower-intensity TTs (>30 min).","Thomas, Kevin; Goodall, Stuart; Stone, Mark; Howatson, Glyn; St Clair Gibson, Alan; Ansley, Les",Medicine and science in sports and exercise,3,8

Resident cell populations of the developing brain have been suggested to be more susceptible to virus-induced cytopathology, a pathway thought to contribute to the clinical outcomes following intrauterine HCMV infection. However, recent findings in a newborn mouse model of the infection in the developing brain have indicated that elevated levels of proinflammatory mediators leading to mononuclear cell activation and recruitment could underlie the abnormal neurodevelopment. In this study, we demonstrate that treatment with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α)-neutralizing antibodies decreased the frequency of CD45+ Ly6Chi CD11b+ CCR2+ activated myeloid mononuclear cells (MMCs) and the levels of proinflammatory cytokines in the blood and the brains of murine CMV-infected mice. This treatment also normalized neurodevelopment in infected mice without significantly impacting the level of virus replication. These results indicate that TNF-α is a major component of the inflammatory response associated with altered neurodevelopment that follows murine CMV infection of the developing brain and that a subset of peripheral blood myeloid mononuclear cells represent a key effector cell population in this model of virus-induced inflammatory disease of the developing brain.IMPORTANCE Congenital human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection is the most common viral infection of the developing human fetus and can result in neurodevelopmental sequelae. Mechanisms of disease leading to neurodevelopmental deficits in infected infants remain undefined, but postulated pathways include loss of neuronal progenitor cells, damage to the developing vascular system of the brain, and altered cellular positioning. Direct virus-mediated cytopathic effects cannot explain the phenotypes of brain damage in most infected infants. Using a mouse model that recapitulates characteristics of the brain infection described in human infants, we have shown that TNF-α plays a key role in brain inflammation, including recruitment of inflammatory mononuclear cells. Neutralization of TNF-α normalized neurodevelopmental abnormalities in infected mice, providing evidence that virus-induced inflammation is a major component of disease in the developing brain. These results suggest that interventions limiting inflammation associated with the infection could potentially improve the neurologic outcome of infants infected in utero with HCMV.","Seleme, Maria C; Kosmac, Kate; Jonjic, Stipan; Britt, William J",Journal of virology,3,31

PATIENT CONCERNS Here we describe the anesthetic management of a 67-year-old man with a massive intrathoracic goiter causing severe tracheal obstruction with positional symptoms. The patient presented with progressive dyspnea that was aggravated in the supine position and was scheduled for total thyroidectomy. DIAGNOSIS Preoperative computed tomography showed a large goiter extending into the thoracic cavity, with diffuse segmental tracheal narrowing for 6 cm. The diameter at the narrowest portion of the trachea was 4.29 mm. INTERVENTIONS Before the induction of general anesthesia, we applied extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in preparation for potential difficulties in securing the airway during general anesthesia. Subsequently, anesthesia was successfully induced and maintained. OUTCOMES After the surgical procedure, fiberoptic bronchoscopy and chest radiography showed resolution of the tracheal narrowing. ECMO was weaned 2 hours after the surgery, and the patient was extubated on the first postoperative day. He was discharged without any complication. CONCLUSION The findings from this case suggest that the use of ECMO before the induction of general anesthesia is a safe method for maintaining oxygenation in patients with severe tracheal obstruction.","Jeong, Young-Il; Jun, In-Gu; Ha, Seung-Soo; Kwon, Hyun-Jung; Lee, Yu-Mi",Medicine,3,1

Intraventricular tension pneumocephalus, however, is a rare complication and a neurosurgical emergency that requires immediate intervention. We describe the first case of intraventricular tension pneumocephalus that developed 1 week following an expanded endoscopic endonasal approach for resection of a suprasellar mass. PATIENT A patient who underwent an endoscopic transplanum transtuberculum approach for resection of a suprasellar epidermoid tumor developed a sudden change in mental status, with imaging consistent with intraventricular tension pneumocephalus. Immediate endotracheal intubation and placement of an external ventricular drain prevented further deterioration. Endoscopic exploration of the skull base reconstruction revealed a one-way ball valve mechanism as the source of pneumocephalus. The skull base reconstruction was revised with autologous fascia lata and repositioning of the pedicled nasoseptal flap. CONCLUSION Intraventricular tension pneumocephalus is a rare neurosurgical emergency that may develop after endoscopic skull base surgery. Initial management includes endotracheal intubation and placement of an external ventricular drain to decompress the ventricles. Endoscopic exploration and revision of the skull base repair is imperative to obliterate the ball-valve fistula to prevent further entrapment of air.","Mammis, Antonios; Agarwal, Nitin; Eloy, Jean Anderson; Liu, James K","Journal of neurological surgery.

There is growing evidence to suggest that the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptor (ACE2 receptor) is expressed on endothelial cells (ECs) in the lung, heart, kidney, and intestine, particularly in systemic vessels (small and large arteries, veins, venules, and capillaries). Upon viral infection of ECs by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronarvirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), ECs become activated and dysfunctional. As a result of endothelial activation and ED, the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin -1, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-α), chemokines (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1), von Willebrand factor (vWF) antigen, vWF activity, and factor VIII are elevated. Higher levels of acute phase reactants (IL-6, C-reactive protein, and D-dimer) are also associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that ED contributes to COVID-19-associated vascular inflammation, particularly endotheliitis, in the lung, heart, and kidney, as well as COVID-19-associated coagulopathy, particularly pulmonary fibrinous microthrombi in the alveolar capillaries. Here we present an update on ED-relevant vasculopathy in COVID-19.

Physical rehabilitation is standard practice following a period of disuse, yet mobility may be severely compromised, and recovery is commonly delayed or incomplete in special populations. Thus, a novel approach toward recovery of muscle mass is highly desired. Pericytes [neuron-glial antigen 2 (NG2)+CD31-CD45- (Lineage- [Lin-]) and CD146+Lin-] demonstrate capacity to facilitate muscle repair, yet the ability to enhance myofiber growth following disuse is unknown. In the current study, 3-4-mo-old mice were unilaterally immobilized for 14 d (IM) or immobilized for 14 d followed by 14 d of remobilization (RE). Flow cytometry and targeted gene expression analyses were completed to assess pericyte quantity and function following IM and RE. In addition, a transplantation study was conducted to assess the impact of pericytes on recovery. Results from targeted analyses suggest minimal impact of disuse on pericyte gene expression, yet NG2+Lin- pericyte quantity is reduced following IM (P < 0.05). Remarkably, pericyte transplantation recovered losses in myofiber cross-sectional area and the capillary-to-fiber ratio following RE, whereas deficits remained with vehicle alone (P = 0.01).

Food consumption is one factor that can significantly alter the bioavailability of some drugs. This manuscript describes a research approach to determine what recommendations to give patients regarding taking oral ziprasidone in relation to food consumption. Four pharmacokinetic studies, the first three in volunteers and the fourth in patients at steady-state on the maximum recommended daily dose of ziprasidone, investigated the relationship between food intake and ziprasidone absorption. These studies illustrate how sequential studies are used in drug development to investigate increasingly precise questions using data from one study to refine the question being addressed by the next. In the first study, the absorption of ziprasidone was shown to double when taken following a high-calorie, high-fat meal versus the fasting state. The second study showed that the difference in absorption between the fasting and fed states increased with dose. The third study suggested that calorie rather than fat content was the critical variable. This finding was confirmed in the fourth study over a wider variety of meals and under clinically relevant dosing conditions. That study also found reduced pharmacokinetic variability (i.e., more consistent absorption) when ziprasidone was administered with 500-1000 kcal meals without regard to fat content rather than under fasting or low-calorie meal conditions. These results have several clinically important implications. First, the effect of taking ziprasidone in a fasting state cannot be overcome simply by increasing the dose. Second, significant swings in ziprasidone concentration and hence efficacy and tolerability may occur on a day-to-day basis if diet is not controlled. Third, patients should be advised to take ziprasidone with a meal containing at least 500 calories (without regard to fat content) to ensure adequate ziprasidone bioavailability and thus achieve optimal efficacy. These four studies illustrate the sequential and incremental nature of drug development research and what is meant by the concept of bioequivalence.","Lincoln, Jana; Stewart, Mark E; Preskorn, Sheldon H",Journal of psychiatric practice,3,31

Anaesthetists, however, do not usually observe the raw EEG data: they generally pay attention only to the Bispectral Index (BIS™) and other indices calculated by EEG monitors. This abstracted information only partially characterizes EEG features. To properly appreciate the availability and reliability of EEG-derived indices, it is necessary to understand how raw EEG changes during anaesthesia. With hemi-frontal lead EEGs obtained under volatile anaesthesia or propofol anaesthesia, the dominant EEG frequency decreases and the amplitude increases with increasing concentrations of anaesthetic. Looking more closely, the EEG changes are more complicated. At surgical concentrations of anaesthesia, spindle waves (alpha range) become dominant. At deeper levels, this activity decreases, and theta and delta waves predominate. At even deeper levels, EEG waveform changes into a burst and suppression pattern, and finally becomes flat. EEG waveforms vary in the presence of noxious stimuli (surgical skin incision), which is not always reflected in BIS™, or other processed EEG indices. Spindle waves are adequately sensitive, however, to noxious stimuli: under surgical anaesthesia they disappear when noxious stimuli are applied, and reappear when adequate analgesia is obtained. To prevent awareness during anaesthesia, I speculate that the most effective strategy is to administer anaesthetic agents in such a way as to maintain anaesthesia at a level where spindle waves predominate.","Hagihira, S",British journal of anaesthesia,3,5

However, tension at the incision after CD in large defects is related to an increased rate of pain and recurrence. We present the preliminary results of a new technique for medium midline hernias as an alternative to conventional CD. METHODS A prospective controlled study was conducted from January 2015 to January 2017 to evaluate an elective new procedure (LIRA) performed on patients with midline ventral hernias (4-10 cm width). The posterior rectus aponeurosis was opened lengthwise around the hernia defect using a laparoscopic approach to create two flaps and was then sutured. The size of the flaps was estimated using a mathematical formula. An on-lay mesh was placed intraperitoneal overlapping the fascia defect. The data analyzed included patient demographics, operative parameters, and complications. A computerized tomography was performed preoperatively and postoperatively (1 month and 1 year) to evaluate recurrence, distance between rectus and seroma. RESULTS Twelve patients were included. Mean width of the defect was 5.5 cm. Average VAS (24 h) was 3.9, 1.1 (1 month), and 0 (1 year). Mean preoperative distance between rectus was 5.5 cm; postoperative was 2.2 cm (1 year). Radiological seroma at first month was detected in 50%. Mean follow-up was 15 months. CONCLUSION The LIRA technique could be considered as an alternative to conventional CD or endoscopic component separation for medium defects under 10 cm in width. This technique obtained a ""no tension"" effect that could be related to a lower rate of postoperative pain with no recurrence or bulging, being a safe, feasible, and reproducible technique.","Gómez-Menchero, Julio; Guadalajara Jurado, Juan Francisco; Suárez Grau, Juan Manuel; Bellido Luque, Juan Antonio; García Moreno, Joaquin Luis; Alarcón Del Agua, Isaías; Morales-Conde, Salvador",Surgical endoscopy,3,1

Prior studies have shown that the majority of patients with fragility fracture are not treated for underlying osteoporosis. Our hospitalist-led co-management service for patients with acute hip fracture had no system for evaluating and treating osteoporosis in this cohort. Our objective was to implement a fracture liaison service (FLS) to assist patients with acute hip fracture and assess subsequent impact on diagnosis and treatment of osteoporosis. METHODS We conducted a pre-post study design at our tertiary academic center, including patients >50 years old hospitalized with acute hip fracture. We implemented a FLS, whereby all patients received endocrinology consultation. Outcome measures included the proportion of patients evaluated for osteoporosis by time of hospital discharge, comparing pre-implementation (12 months) and post-implementation (9 months) cohorts. We also measured the proportions of patients evaluated for and offered treatment for osteoporosis within three months of discharge for patients with post-discharge encounters visible in the medical record. RESULTS We identified 167 patients before and 124 after FLS implementation. In univariate analysis, the proportion of patients evaluated for osteoporosis before discharge increased from 0.6% to 72.6% (p<0.001) pre- vs. post-implementation. The proportion of patients offered osteoporosis treatment within three months after discharge increased from 25.3% to 46.3% (p=0.01). In multivariate analysis, post-implementation patients had higher odds of osteoporosis evaluation while hospitalized (OR = 470.4, p < 0.001) and higher odds of being offered osteoporosis treatment within three months (OR = 2.8, p = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS Establishment of a FLS partnered with a hospitalist-led co-management service for patients with hip fracture was associated with significant improvements in the proportions of patients evaluated and offered treatment for osteoporosis. Wider adoption of this model has the potential to improve care for patients with hip fracture by narrowing the osteoporosis treatment gap.","Stephens, John R; Caraccio, Donald; Mabry, Dana R; Stepanek, Kelly V; Jones, Morgan S; Hemsey, David F; Moore, Carlton R",Hospital practice,3,8

Thus, controlling the expression of MYC is considered as an approach for targeted cancer treatment. Since c-Myc is also a crucial regulator of many cellular processes in healthy cells, it is necessary to find ways for selective regulation of MYC expression in tumor cells. Many recent studies have demonstrated that non-coding RNAs play an important role in the regulation of the transcription and translation of this gene and some RNAs directly interact with the c-Myc protein, affecting its stability. In this review, we summarize current data on the regulation of MYC by various non-coding RNAs that can potentially be targeted in specific tumor types.","Stasevich, Ekaterina Mikhailovna; Murashko, Matvey Mikhailovich; Zinevich, Lyudmila Sergeevna; Demin, Denis Eriksonovich; Schwartz, Anton Markovich",Biomedicines,3,1

METHODS Reported cases of xenobiotic exposures from 1 March to 30 April in 2018, 2019, and 2020 were extracted from the French National Database of Poisonings. The collected data included call, patient, and exposure characteristics for both general calls and for calls involving sentinel xenobiotic categories related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2020 exposures were compared to 2018-2019 exposures by using simple logistic models in order to provide effect size with odds ratios. RESULTS From March to April 2020, 32,182 exposures were reported to French PCCs with an overall increase of 5.6% compared to exposures in the same time frame in 2018-2019. A similar increase in calls was observed in non-epidemic and epidemic COVID-19 areas with an increase in calls from the public (+13.6%) while calls from health-professionals decreased (-7.5%). Despite the increase in exposures, the incidence of symptomatic exposures remained stable (-0.4%) with a decrease in severity (moderate/severe -17.2%). A significant increase in exposures to home cleaning products containing biocides, essential oils, and alcohol-based hand sanitizers (odds ratio >1.3, p < .0001) was observed. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION The COVID-19 pandemic altered calls to French PCCs with a small increase in calls during the study period and changes in the pattern of exposure. These changes possibly reflected the indirect consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic i.e., limited access to primary care, fear of contracting COVID-19 and anxiety related to home isolation.","Le Roux, Gaël; Sinno-Tellier, Sandra; Puskarczyk, Emmanuel; Labadie, Magali; von Fabeck, Katharina; Pélissier, Fanny; Nisse, Patrick; Paret, Nathalie; Descatha, Alexis; Vodovar, Dominique",Clinical toxicology,3,4

This is seemingly related to a better replication of most respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, at lower-than-core body temperatures (i.e., 33 °C vs 37 °C). Also, intrinsic characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 make it a heat-susceptible pathogen. Thermotherapy has successfully been used to combat viral infections in plants which could otherwise result in great economic losses; 90% of viruses causing infections in plants are positive-sense single-stranded ribonucleic acid (+ssRNA) viruses, a characteristic shared by SARS-CoV-2. Thus, it is possible to envision the use of heat-based interventions (thermotherapy or mild-temperature hyperthermia) in patients with COVID-19 for which moderate cycles (every 8-12 h) of mild-temperature hyperthermia (1-2 h) have been proposed. However, there are potential safety and mechanistic concerns which could limit the use of thermotherapy only to patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 to prevent disease progression rather than to treat patients who have already progressed to severe-to-critical COVID-19. Here, we review the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 which make it a heat-susceptible virus, potential host mechanisms which could be enhanced at higher temperatures to aid viral clearance, and how thermotherapy could be investigated as a modality of treatment in patients with COVID-19 while taking into consideration potential risks.","Mancilla-Galindo, Javier; Galindo-Sevilla, Norma","International journal of hyperthermia : the official journal of European Society for Hyperthermic Oncology, North American Hyperthermia Group",3,1

Little is known about the effect of the pandemic on new RNs and their preparedness for such a crisis. This study explored the lived experiences of RNs transitioning from students to professionals during the pandemic. METHOD Semistructured interviews were conducted with 15 new RNs working in acute care facilities during the Maryland COVID-19 State of Emergency. RESULTS Three themes were identified to describe the experiences of new nurses transitioning to practice in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic: uncertainty, vulnerability, and resilience. CONCLUSION New nurses need greater support during transition to practice. Initiatives to improve trusting relationships between new nurses and their organizations and support of the development of essential relationships (e.g., peers, frontline management, and educators) could enhance new nurses' resilience and commitment to stay with the organization.

Multiple workplace- and non-workplace-related factors have been identified in trainee physicians, but it is unclear which factors are most important in association with burnout and stress. Better understanding of the most critical factors could help inform the development of targeted interventions to reduce burnout and stress. Objective To estimate the association between different stressors and burnout/stress among physicians engaged in standard postgraduate training (ie, trainee physicians). Data Sources Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Database of Systematic reviews from inception until April 30, 2019. Search terms included trainee, foundation year, registrar, resident, and intern. Study Selection Studies that reported associations between stressors and burnout/stress in trainee physicians. Data Extraction and Synthesis Two independent reviewers extracted the data and assessed the quality of the evidence. The main meta-analysis was followed by sensitivity analyses. All analyses were performed using random-effects models, and heterogeneity was quantified using the I2 statistic. Main Outcome and Measures The main outcome was the association between burnout/stress and workplace- or non-workplace-related factors reported as odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% CIs. Results Forty-eight studies were included in the meta-analysis (n = 36 266, median age, 29 years [range, 24.6-35.7 years]). One study did not specify participants' sex; of the total population, 18 781 participants (52%) were men. In particular, work demands of a trainee physician were associated with a nearly 3-fold increased odds for burnout/stress (OR, 2.84; 95% CI, 2.26-3.59), followed by concerns about patient care (OR, 2.35; 95% CI, 1.58-3.50), poor work environment (OR, 2.06; 95% CI, 1.57-2.70), and poor work-life balance (OR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.53-2.44). Perceived/reported poor mental or physical health (OR, 2.41; 95% CI, 1.76-3.31), female sex (OR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.20-1.50), financial worries (OR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.07-1.72), and low self-efficacy (OR, 2.13; 95% CI, 1.31-3.46) were associated with increased odds for burnout/stress, whereas younger age and a more junior grade were not significantly associated. Conclusions and Relevance The findings of this study suggest that the odds ratios for burnout and stress in trainee physicians are higher than those for work-related factors compared with nonmodifiable and non-work-related factors, such as age and grade. These findings support the need for organizational interventions to mitigate burnout in trainee physicians.","Zhou, Anli Yue; Panagioti, Maria; Esmail, Aneez; Agius, Raymond; Van Tongeren, Martie; Bower, Peter",JAMA network open,3,1

Radionuclide molecular imaging of EGFR expression in cancer could influence patient management. However, EGFR expression in normal tissues might complicate in vivo imaging. The aim of this study was to evaluate if optimization of the injected protein dose might improve imaging of EGFR expression in tumours using a novel EGFR-targeting protein, the DOTA-Z(EGFR:2377) Affibody molecule. METHODS An anti-EGFR Affibody molecule, Z(EGFR:2377), was labelled with (111)In via the DOTA chelator site-specifically conjugated to a C-terminal cysteine. The affinity of DOTA-Z(EGFR:2377) for murine and human EGFR was measured by surface plasmon resonance. The cellular processing of (111)In-DOTA-Z(EGFR:2377) was evaluated in vitro. The biodistribution of radiolabelled Affibody molecules injected in a broad range of injected Affibody protein doses was evaluated in mice bearing EGFR-expressing A431 xenografts. RESULTS Site-specific coupling of DOTA provided a uniform conjugate possessing equal affinity for human and murine EGFR. The internalization of (111)In-DOTA-Z(EGFR:2377) by A431 cells was slow. In vivo, the conjugate accumulated specifically in xenografts and in EGFR-expressing tissues. The curve representing the dependence of tumour uptake on the injected Affibody protein dose was bell-shaped. The highest specific radioactivity (lowest injected protein dose) provided a suboptimal tumour-to-blood ratio. The results of the biodistribution study were confirmed by gamma-camera imaging. CONCLUSION The (111)In-DOTA-Z(EGFR:2377) Affibody molecule is a promising tracer for radionuclide molecular imaging of EGFR expression in malignant tumours. Careful optimization of protein dose is required for high-contrast imaging of EGFR expression in vivo.","Tolmachev, Vladimir; Rosik, Daniel; Wållberg, Helena; Sjöberg, Anna; Sandström, Mattias; Hansson, Monika; Wennborg, Anders; Orlova, Anna",European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging,3,12

Therapeutically targeting cellular replacement and enhancing structural support may promote neural regeneration. We examined the combinatorial effect of neural precursor cells (NPC) and self assembling peptide (SAP) administration on nerve regeneration. METHODS Nerve injury was induced by clip compression of the rodent spinal cord. SAPs were injected immediately into the injured cord and NPCs at 2 weeks post-injury. Behavioral analysis was done weekly and rats were sacrificed at 11 weeks post injury. LFB-H&E staining was done on cord tissue to assess cavitation volume. Motor evoked potentials (MEP) were measured at week 11 to assess nerve conduction and Kaplan Meier curves were created to compare survival estimates. RESULTS NPCs and SAPs were distributed both caudal and rostral to the injury site. Behavioral analysis showed that SAP + NPC transplantation significantly improved locomotor score p <0.03) and enhanced survival (log rank test, p = 0.008) compared to control. SAP + NPC treatment also improved nerve conduction velocity (p = 0.008) but did not affect cavitation volume (p = 0.73).

In the present proof-of-concept study, we propose a novel delivery system for asONs which implies the delivery of modified antisense oligonucleotides by so-called transport oligonucleotides (tON), which are oligodeoxyribonucleotides complementary to asON conjugated with hydrophobic dodecyl moieties. Two types of tONs, bearing at the 5'-end up to three dodecyl residues attached through non-nucleotide inserts (TD series) or anchored directly to internucleotidic phosphate (TP series), were synthesized. tONs with three dodecyl residues efficiently delivered asON to cells without any signs of cytotoxicity and provided a transfection efficacy comparable to that achieved using Lipofectamine 2000. We found that, in the case of tON with three dodecyl residues, some tON/asON duplexes were excreted from the cells within extracellular vesicles at late stages of transfection. We confirmed the high efficacy of the novel and demonstrated that MDR1 mRNA targeted asON delivered by tON with three dodecyl residues significantly reduced the level of P-glycoprotein and increased the sensitivity of KB-8-5 human carcinoma cells to vinblastine. The obtained results demonstrate the efficacy of lipophilic oligonucleotide carriers and shows they are potentially capable of intracellular delivery of any kind of antisense oligonucleotides.","Markov, Oleg V; Filatov, Anton V; Kupryushkin, Maxim S; Chernikov, Ivan V; Patutina, Olga A; Strunov, Anton A; Chernolovskaya, Elena L; Vlassov, Valentin V; Pyshnyi, Dmitrii V; Zenkova, Marina A",Molecules,3,12

Objectives: The objective of this study was to identify the sociodemographic and clinical variables that could explain the cost per day of PC for cancer in Brazil. Methods: This was a retrospective cost analysis of PC at a quaternary cancer center in São Paulo, Brazil, between January 2010 and December 2013. Factors influencing the cost per day were assessed with generalized linear models and generalized linear-mixed models in which the random effect was the site of the cancer. Results: The study included 2985 patients. The mean total cost per patient was $12,335 (standard deviation [SD] = 14,602; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 11,803 to 12,851). The mean cost per day per patient was $325.50 (SD = 246.30, 95% CI = 316.60 to 334.30). There were statistically significant differences among cancer sites in terms of the mean cost per day. Multivariate analysis revealed that the drivers of cost per day were Karnofsky performance status, the number of hospital admissions, referral to PC, and place of death. Place of death had the greatest impact on the cost per day; death in a hospital and in hospice care increased the mean cost per day by $1.56 and $1.83, respectively. Conclusion: To allocate resources effectively, PC centers in LMICs should emphasize early enrollment of patients at PC outpatient clinics, to avoid hospital readmission, as well as advance planning of the place of death.","Rozman, Luciana Martins; Campolina, Alessandro Gonçalves; Patiño, Elizabeth González; de Soárez, Patrícia Coelho",Journal of palliative medicine,3,19

The severity of the disease is variable ranging from mild form of pneumonia to severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) that necessitates admission to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) requiring maximal level of organ support. Failure of the maximum support through mechanical ventilation can lead to the consideration of a higher level of organ support through extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). We present a case of an 8 years old girl, who presented with severe ARDS secondary to COVID-19 pneumonia for which a venovenous-extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV ECMO) was initiated. This was followed by the patient developing cardiac arrest which was managed with extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR). The patient was also given thrombolytic therapy during the ECPR due to high clinical suspicion for pulmonary embolism. VV-A ECMO was then continued and the patient was successfully weaned off both VA and VV ECMO and discharged home with full neurological recovery.

However, the total deficit in screening in the US associated with the pandemic and the differential impact on individuals in different geographic regions and by socioeconomic status (SES) index have yet to be fully characterized. Objectives To quantify the screening rates for breast, colorectal, and prostate cancers associated with the COVID-19 pandemic in different geographic regions and for individuals in different SES index quartiles and estimate the overall cancer screening deficit in 2020 across the US population. Design, Setting, and Participants This retrospective cohort study uses the HealthCore Integrated Research Database, which comprises single-payer administrative claims data and enrollment information covering approximately 60 million people in Medicare Advantage and commercial health plans from across geographically diverse regions of the US. Participants were individuals in the database in January through July of 2018, 2019, and 2020 without diagnosis of the cancer of interest prior to the analytic index month. Exposures Analytic index month and year. Main Outcomes and Measures Receipt of breast, colorectal, or prostate cancer screening. Results Screening for all 3 cancers declined sharply in March through May of 2020 compared with 2019, with the sharpest decline in April (breast, -90.8%; colorectal, -79.3%; prostate, -63.4%) and near complete recovery of monthly screening rates by July for breast and prostate cancers. The absolute deficit across the US population in screening associated with the COVID-19 pandemic was estimated to be 3.9 million (breast), 3.8 million (colorectal), and 1.6 million (prostate). Geographic differences were observed: the Northeast experienced the sharpest declines in screening, while the West had a slower recovery compared with the Midwest and South. For example, percentage change in breast cancer screening rate (2020 vs 2019) for the month of April ranged from -87.3% (95% CI, -87.9% to -86.7%) in the West to -94.5% (95% CI, -94.9% to -94.1%) in the Northeast (decline). For the month of July, it ranged from -0.3% (95% CI, -2.1% to 1.5%) in the Midwest to -10.6% (-12.6% to -8.4%) in the West (recovery). By SES, the largest screening decline was observed in individuals in the highest SES index quartile, leading to a narrowing in the disparity in cancer screening by SES in 2020. For example, prostate cancer screening rates per 100 000 enrollees for individuals in the lowest and highest SES index quartiles, respectively, were 3525 (95% CI, 3444 to 3607) and 4329 (95% CI, 4271 to 4386) in April 2019 compared with 1535 (95% CI, 1480 to 1589) and 1338 (95% CI, 1306 to 1370) in April 2020.

This is due to an on-going inability to produce a suitable tissue engineered substrate that can satisfactorily replicate the epidermal and dermal in vivo niches to fulfil both aesthetic and functional demands. The current gold standard treatment of autologous skin grafting is inadequate because of poor textural durability, scarring and associated contracture, and because of a paucity of donor sites in larger burns. Tissue engineering has seen exponential growth in recent years with a number of 'off-the-shelf' dermal and epidermal substitutes now available. Each has its own limitations. In this review, we examine normal wound repair in relation to stem/progenitor cells that are intimately involved in this process within the dermal niche. Endothelial precursors, in particular, are examined closely and their phenotype, morphology and enrichment from multiple sources are described in an attempt to provide some clarity regarding the controversy surrounding their classification and role in vasculogenesis. We also review the role of the next generation of cellularized scaffolds and smart biomaterials that attempt to improve the revascularisation of artificial grafts, the rate of wound healing and the final cosmetic and functional outcome.","Markeson, Daniel; Pleat, Jonathon M; Sharpe, Justin R; Harris, Adrian L; Seifalian, Alexander M; Watt, Suzanne M",Journal of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine,3,16

Well water testing is a primary method to identify such risks, although testing rates are generally low. Risk communication is used as an intervention to promote private well testing behavior; however, little is known about whether these efforts are effective as well as the mechanisms that influence effectiveness. A systematic scoping review was conducted to evaluate the current evidence base for risk communication effectiveness and factors that influence well testing behavior. The review was conducted with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) framework. Data were synthesized using a health behavior model (Health Belief Model) to identify areas amenable to intervention and factors to consider when designing risk communication interventions. We identified a significant shortage of studies examining the effectiveness of risk communication interventions targeted to well testing behavior, with only two quasi-experimental studies identified. The review also identified seventeen studies that examined or described factors relating to well testing behavior. The two empirical studies suggest risk communication methods can be successful in motivating private well owners to test their water, while the remaining studies present considerations for developing effective, community-specific content.","Colley, Sarah K; Kane, Peter K M; MacDonald Gibson, Jacqueline",International journal of environmental research and public health,3,1

There is limited information regarding postoperative surveillance and survivorship care in the Australian context. This study investigated patterns of colorectal cancer surveillance at a large tertiary institution. METHODS A retrospective review of hospital records was conducted for all patients treated with curative surgery between January 2012 and June 2017. Provision of clinical surveillance, colonoscopy, computed tomography (CT), and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) within 24 months postoperatively were recorded. Kaplan-Meier estimates were used to evaluate time-to-surveillance review and associated investigations. RESULTS A total of 675 patients were included in the study. Median time to first postoperative clinical review was 20 days (95% confidence interval (CI), 18-21) with only 31% of patients having their first postoperative clinic review within 2 weeks. Median time to first CEA was 100 days (95% CI, 92-109), with 47% of patients having their CEA checked within the first 3 months, increasing to 68% at 6 months. Median time to first follow-up CT scan was 262 days (95% CI, 242-278) and for colonoscopy, 560 days (95% CI, 477-625). Poor uptake of surveillance testing was more prevalent in patients from older age groups, those with multiple comorbidities, and higher stage cancers. CONCLUSION Colorectal cancer surveillance is multi-disciplinary and involves several parallel processes, many of which lead to inconsistent follow-up. Further prospective work is required to identify the reasons for variation in care and which aspects are most important to cancer patients.","Pellegrino, Samantha A; Chan, Steven; Simons, Koen; Kinsella, Rita; Gibbs, Peter; Faragher, Ian G; Deftereos, Irene; Yeung, Justin Mc",Asia-Pacific journal of clinical oncology,3,2

MATERIAL AND METHODS A cross-sectional seroepidemiological survey was developed after the peak of the first epidemic wave on a sample of 2301 Portuguese residents, aged 1 year or older. Survey sample was selected using a two-stage stratified non-probability sampling design (quota sampling). SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G antibodies were measured in serum samples by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Seroprevalence estimates of immunoglobulin M and/or immunoglobulin G and 95% confidence intervals were stratified by sex, age group, health region and education. RESULTS Overall, seroprevalence was 2.9% (95% confidence interval: 2.0% - 4.2%). Higher prevalence rates were observed in male (4.1%, 95% confidence interval: 2.6% - 6.6%) and those with secondary education (6.4%, 95% confidence interval: 3.2% - 12.5%). Differences in seroprevalence by age group and region were not statistically significant. DISCUSSION The estimated seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was higher than the cumulative incidence reported by the National Surveillance System but far from necessary to reach herd immunity. CONCLUSION Our results support limited extent of infection by SARS-CoV-2 in the study population possibly due to early lockdown measures implemented in Portugal and support the need to continue monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in order to increase our knowledge about the evolution of the epidemic and to estimate the proportion of the susceptible population over time.","Kislaya, Irina; Gonçalves, Paulo; Barreto, Marta; Sousa, Rita; Garcia, Ana Cristina; Matos, Rita; Guiomar, Raquel; Rodrigues, Ana Paula",Acta medica portuguesa,3,13

Our understanding of vitamin D metabolism and its extra-skeletal functions has improved significantly over the past three decades, and the discovery that the vitamin D receptor and 1a-hydroxylase, an enzyme needed to convert vitamin D to its active form, is present in the cells of the immune system, revolutionized in this area. Recent studies have shown that vitamin D regulates the expression of specific endogenous antimicrobial peptides in immune cells, modulates the immune response and the course of autoimmune processes; these actions indicate the potential role of vitamin D in modulating the immune response to various infectious diseases.

He had a Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score of 1; therefore, a surgical excision was planned due to the possibility for malignancy. A robotic approach with enucleation of the lesion was undertaken, with plans for return for a wider resection if pathological examination revealed malignancy.

In this systematic review, we evaluated available data for adult patients to determine (1) whether decrements in cerebral oximetry during cardiac surgery are associated with stroke, postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD), or delirium; and (2) whether interventions aimed at correcting cerebral oximetry decrements improve neurologic outcomes. METHODS We searched PubMed, Cochrane, and Embase databases from inception until January 31, 2012, without restriction on languages. Each article was examined for additional references. A publication was excluded if it did not include original data (e.g., review, commentary) or if it was not published as a full-length article in a peer-reviewed journal (e.g., abstract only). The identified abstracts were screened first, and full texts of eligible articles were reviewed independently by 2 investigators. For eligible publications, we recorded the number of subjects, type of surgery, and criteria for diagnosis of neurologic end points. RESULTS We identified 13 case reports, 27 observational studies, and 2 prospectively randomized intervention trials that met our inclusion criteria. Case reports and 2 observational studies contained anecdotal evidence suggesting that regional cerebral O(2) saturation (rSco(2)) monitoring could be used to identify cardiopulmonary bypass cannula malposition. Six of 9 observational studies reported an association between acute rSco(2) desaturation and POCD based on the Mini-Mental State Examination (n = 3 studies) or more detailed cognitive testing (n = 6 studies). Two retrospective studies reported a relationship between rSco(2) desaturation and stroke or type I and II neurologic injury after surgery. The observational studies had many limitations, including small sample size, assessments only during the immediate postoperative period, and failure to perform risk adjustments. Two randomized studies evaluated the efficacy of interventions for treating rSco(2) desaturation during surgery, but adherence to the protocol was poor in one. In the other study, interventions for rSco(2) desaturation were associated with less major organ injury and shorter intensive care unit hospitalization compared with nonintervention. CONCLUSIONS Reductions in rSco(2) during cardiac surgery may identify cardiopulmonary bypass cannula malposition, particularly during aortic surgery. Only low-level evidence links low rSco(2) during cardiac surgery to postoperative neurologic complications, and data are insufficient to conclude that interventions to improve rSco(2) desaturation prevent stroke or POCD.","Zheng, Fei; Sheinberg, Rosanne; Yee, May-Sann; Ono, Masa; Zheng, Yueyging; Hogue, Charles W",Anesthesia and analgesia,3,20

Quantitative evaluation of Ki67 is traditionally performed by assessing stained tissue slides using light microscopy. Automated image analysis systems have become available and if validated they could provide greater standardisation and improving precision of Ki67 scoring. Here, we aimed to evaluate the use of the Cognition Master Professional Suite (CogM) image analysis software, a simple system for scoring Ki67 in primary breast cancer samples. METHODS AND RESULTS Sections from 94 core-cut biopsies, 20 excision specimens, and 29 pairs of core-cuts and excisions were stained for Ki67 with MIB1 antibody and the Dako EnVision FLEX Detection System. Stained slides were scanned to convert them to digital data. Computer-based Ki67 scoring was performed by CogM. Manual Ki67 scoring assessment was conducted on previously stained sections from the same biopsies using a clinically validated system that had been calibrated against risk of recurrence. A high correlation between manual and digital scores was observed (rCores =0.92, 95% CI=0.87-0.94, p<0.0001; rExcisions =0.95, 95% CI=0.86-0.98, p<0.0001) and there was no significant bias between them (p=0.45). There was also a high correlation on Ki67 scores between paired core-cuts and excisions using CogM (r=0.78, 95% CI=0.59-0.89, p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS CogM image analysis allows for a standardised automated Ki67 scoring that accurately replicates previously clinically validated and calibrated manual scores.","Alataki, Anastasia; Zabaglo, Lila; Tovey, Holly; Dodson, Andrew; Dowsett, Mitch",Histopathology,3,1

We aimed to differentiate the associations between NO2 exposure and YLL from major pathological types of stroke in China, and estimate the relevant economic loss. A time-series study was conducted to explore the associations between short-term NO2 exposure and YLL from ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke from 2013 to 2017 in 48 Chinese cities. Daily NO2 data and stroke mortality counts for each city were obtained from the National Urban Air Quality Real-time Publishing Platform and Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, respectively. Generalized additive models were applied to estimate the cumulative effects of NO2 in each city, and meta-analysis was used to combine the city-specific estimates. The relevant economic loss was estimated using the method of the value per statistical life year (VSLY). A 10 μg/m3 increase in ambient NO2 concentration on the present day and previous day (lag 0-1) would lead to relatively higher increments in percentage change of YLL from ischaemic stroke (0.82%, 95% CI: 0.46%, 1.19%) than haemorrhagic stroke (0.46%, 95% CI: 0.09%, 0.84%). The association was significantly stronger in the low-education population than high-education population for ischaemic stroke. Furthermore, significantly higher association was found in South China than those in North China for both subtypes of stroke. Economic loss due to excess YLL from ischaemic stroke related to NO2 exposure was higher than that for haemorrhagic stroke. Our study indicated higher association and economic loss of ischaemic than haemorrhagic stroke related to NO2 exposure in China, which informed priorities for type-specific stroke prevention strategies related to NO2 pollution and vulnerable population protection.","Li, Jie; Huang, Jing; Wang, Yuxin; Yin, Peng; Wang, Lijun; Liu, Yang; Pan, Xiaochuan; Zhou, Maigeng; Li, Guoxing",Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,3,27

OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to investigate differences in CT manifestations of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pneumonia and those of influenza virus pneumonia. MATERIALS AND METHODS. We conducted a retrospective study of 52 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and 45 patients with influenza virus pneumonia. All patients had positive results for the respective viruses from nucleic acid testing and had complete clinical data and CT images. CT findings of pulmonary inflammation, CT score, and length of largest lesion were evaluated in all patients. Mean density, volume, and mass of lesions were further calculated using artificial intelligence software. CT findings and clinical data were evaluated. RESULTS. Between the group of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and the group of patients with influenza virus pneumonia, the largest lesion close to the pleura (i.e., no pulmonary parenchyma between the lesion and the pleura), mucoid impaction, presence of pleural effusion, and axial distribution showed statistical difference (p < 0.05). The properties of the largest lesion, presence of ground-glass opacity, presence of consolidation, mosaic attenuation, bronchial wall thickening, centrilobular nodules, interlobular septal thickening, crazy paving pattern, air bronchogram, unilateral or bilateral distribution, and longitudinal distribution did not show significant differences (p > 0.05). In addition, no significant difference was seen in CT score, length of the largest lesion, mean density, volume, or mass of the lesions between the two groups (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION. Most lesions in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were located in the peripheral zone and close to the pleura, whereas influenza virus pneumonia was more prone to show mucoid impaction and pleural effusion. However, differentiating between COVID-19 pneumonia and influenza virus pneumonia in clinical practice remains difficult.","Lin, Liaoyi; Fu, Gangze; Chen, Shuangli; Tao, Jiejie; Qian, Andan; Yang, Yunjun; Wang, Meihao",AJR.

In this study, we review the contribution of soils to the regulation of air quality, which is one of 'Nature's Contributions to People' identified by the Intergovernmental-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES). This is particularly relevant for SDG3 (health and well-being) and 11 (sustainable cities and well-being) but also impacts other SDGs. Soils can act as both a source and a sink of air pollutants (and their precursors). In addition, soils support plant growth which plays a major role in regulating air quality. The scale of the soil impacts on air quality range from global (e.g. greenhouse gas fluxes, stratospheric ozone depletion) to local (e.g. odours, particulates, pathogen transport). Harmful emissions from soil can be increased or decreased by anthropogenic activity, while climate change is likely to modify future emissions patterns, both directly and in response to human mitigation and adaption actions. Although soils are not the only source of these pollutants, it is worthwhile managing them to reduce erosion and nutrient losses to maintain soil health so we may continue to benefit from the contributions to good quality of life they provide.

COVID-19 is caused by the virus SARS- CoV-2, it enters the cells through the ACE2 receptor (angiotensin converting enzyme 2). It is well known that SARS-CoV-2 could develop mild, moderate, and severe respiratory symptoms that could lead to death. The virus receptor is expressed in different organs such as the lungs, kidney, intestine, and brain, among others. In the lung could cause pneumonia and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The brain can be directly affected by cellular damage due to viral invasion, which can lead to an inflammatory response, by the decrease in the enzymatic activity of ACE2 that regulates neuroprotective, neuro-immunomodulatory and neutralizing functions of oxidative stress. Another severe damage is hypoxemia in patients that do not receive adequate respiratory support. The neurological symptoms that the patient presents, will depend on factors that condition the expression of ACE2 in the brain such as age and sex, as well as the mechanism of neuronal invasion, the immune response and the general state of the patient.

Diagnosis and treatment of TB infection requires completion of a sequence of steps, collectively termed the TB infection care cascade. There has been no systematic attempt to comprehensively summarise literature on the paediatric TB infection care cascade. METHODS We performed a scoping review of the paediatric TB infection care cascade. We systematically searched PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Cochrane and Embase databases. We reviewed articles and meeting abstracts that included children and adolescents ≤21 years old who were screened for or diagnosed with TB infection, and which described completion of at least one step of the cascade. We synthesised studies to identify facilitators and barriers to retention, interventions to mitigate attrition and knowledge gaps. RESULTS We identified 146 studies examining steps in the paediatric TB infection care cascade; 31 included children living in low-income and middle-income countries. Most literature described the final cascade step (treatment initiation to completion). Studies identified an array of patient and caregiver-related factors associated with completion of cascade steps. Few health systems factors were evaluated as potential predictors of completion, and few interventions to improve retention were specifically tested. CONCLUSIONS We identified strengths and gaps in the literature describing the paediatric TB infection care cascade. Future research should examine cascade steps upstream of treatment initiation and focus on identification and testing of at-risk paediatric patients. Additionally, future studies should focus on modifiable health systems factors associated with attrition and may benefit from use of behavioural theory and implementation science methods to improve retention.","Campbell, Jeffrey I; Sandora, Thomas J; Haberer, Jessica E",BMJ global health,3,17

This calls for an ethical analysis relevant to clinicians. The aim was to analyse ethically difficult situations in the process of deciding whether a patient is admitted to intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS Analysis using the 'Dilemma method' and 'wide reflective equilibrium', on ethnographic data of 45 patient cases and 96 stakeholder interviews in six UK hospitals. ETHICAL ANALYSIS Four moral questions and associated value conflicts were identified. (1) Who should have the right to decide whether a patient needs to be reviewed? Conflicting perspectives on safety/security. (2) Does the benefit to the patient of getting the decision right justify the cost to the patient of a delay in making the decision? Preventing longer-term suffering and understanding patient's values conflicted with preventing short-term suffering and provision of security. (3) To what extent should the intensivist gain others' input? Professional independence versus a holistic approach to decision-making. (4) Should the intensivist have an ongoing duty of care to patients not admitted to ICU? Short-term versus longer-term duty to protect patient safety. Safety and security (experienced in a holistic sense of physical and emotional security for patients) were key values at stake in the ethical conflicts identified. The life-threatening nature of the situation meant that the principle of autonomy was overshadowed by the duty to protect patients from harm. The need to fairly balance obligations to the referred patient and to other patients was also recognised. CONCLUSION Proactive decision-making including advance care planning and escalation of treatment decisions may support the inclusion of patient autonomy. However, our analysis invites binary choices, which may not sufficiently reflect reality. This calls for a complementary relational ethics analysis.","Svantesson, Mia; Griffiths, Frances; White, Catherine; Bassford, Chris; Slowther, AnneMarie",Journal of medical ethics,3,5

DESIGN This is an cross-sectional study. METHODS A questionnaire was directed to the young Ophthalmologists of Ophthalmology department in Cairo University hospitals. The primary outcome measures were the effects of COVID-19 pandemic on ophthalmology practice. RESULTS Seventy-nine young Ophthalmologists responded to the questionnaire, with an age ranging from 24 to 36 years of age of which 57% were females. They all practiced Ophthalmology from less than one year up to 9 years long, with 55.8% of them feeling unlucky starting ophthalmic practice during this era, 7.6% are extremely anxious regarding their psychological concern about the pandemic, and some feel they need psychological assessment especially those with 1-3 years duration of practice (41.2%) (p = .011) , especially females (82.4%, p = .015 ). As for access to PPE, 94.9% are wearing masks in the clinic, but only 8.9% of patients are wearing masks. Before this lockdown, 16.7% of the enrolled candidates attended on line lectures and webinars, but since then, this has significantly surged to 80.5% (p < .001) . CONCLUSION Due to COVID-19 pandemic, as with everybody else, our young ophthalmologists have been affected on many different levels; psychologically, education and practice levels.","El-Saied, Heba Magdy Ahmed; Salah Eddin Abdelhakim, Mohamad Amr",Seminars in ophthalmology,3,31

We sought to review the economic costs and benefits of prescribed CBMs in any chronic illness, and the frameworks used for their economic evaluation. METHODS A systematic review of eight medical and economic databases, from inception to mid-December 2016, was undertaken. MeSH headings and text words relating to economic costs and benefits, and CBMs were combined. Study quality was assessed using relevant checklists and results were synthesised in narrative form. RESULTS Of 2514 identified records, ten studies met the eligibility criteria, all for the management of multiple sclerosis (MS). Six contained economic evaluations, four studies reported utility-based quality of life, and one was a willingness-to-pay study. Four of five industry-sponsored cost-utility analyses for MS spasticity reported nabiximols as being cost-effective from a European health system perspective. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained for these five studies were £49,257 (UK); £10,891 (Wales); €11,214 (Germany); €4968 (Italy); and dominant (Spain). Nabiximols for the management of MS spasticity was not associated with statistically significant improvements in EQ-5D scores compared with standard care. Study quality was moderate overall, with limited inclusion of both relevant societal costs and discussions of potential bias. CONCLUSIONS Prescribed CBMs are a potentially cost-effective add-on treatment for MS spasticity; however, this evidence is uncertain. Further investment in randomised trials with in-built economic evaluations is warranted for a wider range of clinical indications.

AREAS COVERED This review provides the clinician with an overview of the prevalence and clinical impact of severe chronic upper and lower airways disease and suggests a novel therapeutic approach with biological agents with possible biomarkers. To select relevant literature for inclusion in this review, we conducted a literature search using the PubMed database, using terms 'severe airways disease' AND 'endotype' AND 'treatment.' The literature review was performed for publication years 2010-2020, restricting the articles to humans and English language publications. EXPERT OPINION The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has brought forth many challenges for patients with severe airway disease and healthcare practitioners involved in care. These patients could have an increased risk of developing severe SARS-CoV-2 disease, although treatment with biologics is not associated with a worse prognosis. Eosinopenia on hospital admission plays a key role as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker.","De Filippo, Maria; Votto, Martina; Licari, Amelia; Pagella, Fabio; Benazzo, Marco; Ciprandi, Giorgio; Marseglia, Gian Luigi",Expert review of respiratory medicine,3,1

A retrospective review of 93 patients who underwent LD placement at our institution between 2006 and 2011 was performed. Of these patients, 43 underwent elective LD placement prior to ASB surgery; 2 patients had evidence of CSF rhinorrhea prior to surgery, and 41 had no evidence of a preoperative CSF leak. Of those 41 patients, 2 developed CSF rhinorrhea (2/41= 4.9%) as a result of surgery-all in our endoscopic patient population (N = 21; 2/21= 9.5%). No postoperative CSF leaks were noted in our open ASB surgery cohort (N = 20). Other complications were rare, but we encountered two instances of delayed malignant cerebral edema in the open ASB cohort that are discussed in detail.

Is it time for a paradigm shift?,14.254844,8.207606,2013,"Background The primary focus of video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) sleeve lobectomy is bronchial anastomosis. Both interrupted suture and continuous suture cannot overcome entanglement of the suture threads. The present study used the ""continuous suture dividing and equal suture tightening"" method in VATS sleeve lobectomy for bronchial anastomosis and discussed the feasibility of this approach. Methods A total of 17 patients underwent VATS sleeve lobectomy with bronchial anastomosis using the ""continuous suture dividing and equal suture tightening"" method. Four incisions were utilized in the operation as follows: (I) the pulmonary arteries and veins were cut-off using an endoscopic linear stapler. Systematic hilar and mediastinal lymph node dissection was performed; (II) the surgeon used a surgical knife for incision into the thoracic cavity and to cut the lung lobe and main bronchi. Intraoperative pathological analysis revealed negative bronchial margins; (III) the ""continuous suture dividing and equal suture tightening"" method was performed for anastomosis; (IV) the integrity of the anastomosis was assessed by intraoperative bronchoscopy. Computed tomography (CT), three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction and bronchoscopy assessed the anastomosis 1-week postoperatively. A follow-up was conducted using a 3-month bronchoscopy, and CT scans monitored the recurrence and stenosis of the anastomosis. Results The method was successfully completed for VATS sleeve lobectomy with bronchial anastomosis in 17 cases. Although various histological profiles were observed, the 1-week postoperative CT and bronchoscopy showed adequate healing of the anastomotic stoma as well as the absence of postoperative mortality and bronchial pleural fistula. All patients were alive and followed up for 31-49 months postoperatively; local recurrence and anastomotic stenosis were not detected. Conclusions The continuous suture dividing and equal suture tightening method is convenient, feasible, and safe for bronchial anastomosis in VATS sleeve lobectomy. It can effectively avoid the entanglement of the suture threads, thereby enabling the widespread adoption of VATS sleeve lobectomy.","Zhang, Zheng; Huang, Quanfu; Liao, Yongde; Ai, Bo; Huang, Qi",Journal of thoracic disease,3,1

AIM To examine pregnant women's levels of stress, mental and physical health, and health behaviours during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS A cross-sectional survey was conducted online, with recruitment and data collection occurring between 16/6/20 and 17/7/20. Participants were pregnant women recruited via online pregnancy/parenting communities. Participants self-reported their levels of general stress, pregnancy-specific stress and COVID-19 related stress, mental and physical health, general health behaviours, and COVID-19 related health behaviours. FINDINGS 573 pregnant women participated in the survey. Participants were most commonly resident in the United States (42.6%, n=243), Ireland (41.2%, n=235) or the United Kingdom (10%, n=57). The majority (80.0%, n=457) were married and educated to degree level or above (79.3, n=453). Pregnant women reported high levels of pregnancy-specific and COVID-19-related stress, and low levels of mental and physical health, during the pandemic. Encouragingly, pregnant women in this study generally reported high levels of adherence to public health advice and pregnancy health behaviours. Stress and general mental health outcomes were best predicted by well-being factors (including stress and social support). Health impairing behaviours (e.g. poor diet) were predicted by both well-being and demographic factors. DISCUSSION Interventions targeting pregnancy- and pandemic-specific stress at the population level will be essential to support mental health and minimise adverse outcomes for women and children during the pandemic.","Pope, Johanna; Olander, Ellinor K; Leitao, Sara; Meaney, Sarah; Matvienko-Sikar, Karen",Women and birth : journal of the Australian College of Midwives,3,12

It can be synthetized by many yeast species in a one-step reduction of xylose. Arabinose is a common contaminant found in xylose and there is ongoing interest in finding biocatalysts that selectively produce xyltiol. From a screen of 99 yeasts, Barnettozyma populi Y-12728 was found to selectively produce xylitol from both mixed sugars and corn stover hemicellulosic hydrolysate. Here, fermentation conditions for xylitol production from xylose by B. populi were optimized. The medium for xylitol production was optimized through response surface methodology. The yeast produced 31.2 ± 0.4 g xylitol from xylose (50 g L-1) in 62 h using the optimized medium. The optimal pH for xylitol production was 6.0. Glucose (10 g L-1), acetic acid (6.0 g L-1), HMF (4 mM) and ethanol (2.0 g L-1) inhibited the xylitol production. The glucose inhibition was entirely mitigated by using a 2-stage aeration strategy, indicating that the yeast was inhibited by ethanol produced from glucose under low aeration. This culture strategy will greatly benefit xylitol production from hemicellulosic hydrolysates, which often contain glucose. This is the first report on optimization of xylitol production by a Barnettozyma species.","Saha, Badal C; Kennedy, Gregory J",Preparative biochemistry & biotechnology,3,1

Methods: Case investigation was based on the traditional epidemiological survey, combined with analysis based on big data about population movement trajectories. Transmission chain was identified to indicate transmission relationship. Results: A total of 27 cases were found in this cluster epidemic, including 25 confirmed cases, 1 suspected case (index case) and 1 asymptomatic carrier. A total of 347 close contacts were found. The secondary attack rate was 7.2% (25/347). The infection rates in close contacts of the first, second, third and fourth generation cases were 52.6% (10/19), 6.1% (13/213), 2.3% (2/88) and 0.0% (0/27), respectively.

Although many cases of dehiscence can be managed non-operatively, major leakage requires a second surgery and can potentially lead to death. Therefore, accurate and immediate diagnosis and treatment are essential. CASE PRESENTATION In this report, we describe a 66-year-old Japanese man who was diagnosed with a complete separation of an esophagojejunal anastomosis after laparoscopic total gastrectomy with oral contrast radiography using Gastrografin®. The severe complication was successfully treated by re-anastomosis after two emergency drainage surgeries. After the second surgery, the esophageal end formed a fistula with the jejunum, but balloon dilation failed to open the fistula. Therefore, oral ingestion and conservative treatment were considered unsuitable, and we performed esophagojejunal re-anastomosis 7 months after the first surgery. At a follow-up examination 2 years after re-anastomosis, the patient weighed 47 kg, and his ingestion had recovered to 80% of that before surgery. CONCLUSIONS Complete separation of an esophagojejunal anastomosis is a rare but severe complication of total gastrectomy. Therefore, we consider that once separation is diagnosed, aggressive and urgent re-operation and effective drainage are useful. Moreover, it is necessary to take great care to minimize the operative morbidity associated with esophagojejunal anastomosis.","Oka, Shinichi; Sakuramoto, Shinichi; Chuman, Motohiro; Aratani, Kenichi; Wakata, Mitsuo; Miyawaki, Yutaka; Gunji, Hisashi; Sato, Hiroshi; Okamoto, Koujun; Yamaguchi, Shigeki; Koyama, Isamu",BMC research notes,3,1

Based on the policy at our hospital, only CAS was performed on patients (n = 33) between January 2005 and November 2009. From December 2009 to December 2012, either CEA or CAS (tailored treatment) was selected for patients (n = 61) based on individual patient risk factors. CEA was considered the first-line treatment in all cases. In high-risk CEA cases, CAS was performed instead (n = 11), whereas in low-risk CEA cases, CEA was performed (n = 19). Further, in moderate-risk CEA cases based on own criteria, CAS was considered first, whereas for high-risk CAS cases, CEA was performed (n = 17). For low-risk CAS cases, CAS was performed (n = 9). Perioperative clinical complications (any stroke, myocardial infarction, or death within 30 days) were compared between both periods. Significantly reduced perioperative complications were observed during the tailored period (4/61 sites, 6.6%) as compared with the CAS period (8/33 sites, 24.2%) [Fisher's exact test p = 0.022; odds ratio, 4.56 (CAS/tailored); 95% confidence interval, 1.26-16.5]. Selecting an appropriate individualized treatment method according to patient risk factors, as opposed to adhering to a single treatment approach such as CAS, may contribute to improved overall outcomes in patients with ICS.","Sato, Kimitoshi; Suzuki, Sachio; Yamada, Masaru; Oka, Hidehiro; Kurata, Akira; Okamoto, Hirotsugu; Fujii, Kiyotaka; Kumabe, Toshihiro",Neurologia medico-chirurgica,3,1

To identify predictive factors of unfavourable outcome among patients hospitalized for COVID-19.Methods. We conducted a monocentric retrospective cohort study ofCOVID-19 patients hospitalized in Paris area. An unfavourable outcome was defined as the need for artificial ventilation and/or death. Characteristics at admission were analysed to identify factors predictive of unfavourableoutcome using multivariable Cox proportional hazard models. Based on the results, anomogram to predict 14-day probability ofpooroutcome was proposed.Results. Between March 15th and April 14th, 2020, 279 COVID-19 patients were hospitalized after a median of 7 days after the first symptoms. Among them, 88 (31.5%) patients had an unfavourable outcome:48 were admitted tothe ICU for artificial ventilation, and 40 patients died without being admitted to ICU. Multivariable analyses retained age, overweight, polypnoea, fever, high C-reactive protein, elevatedus troponin-I, and lymphopenia as risk factors ofan unfavourable outcome. A nomogram was established with sufficient discriminatory power (C-index 0.75), and proper consistence between the prediction and the observation.Conclusion. We identified seven easily available prognostic factors and proposed a simplenomogram for early detection of patients at risk of aggravation,inorder to optimize clinical care and initiate specific therapies.

As such, viral pathogens have devised multiple mechanisms to antagonize this pathway and thus facilitate infection. Dengue virus (DENV) encodes several proteins (NS2a, NS4a, and NS4b) that have been shown individually to inhibit the IFN response. In addition, DENV infection results in reduced levels of expression of STAT2, which is required for IFN signaling (M. Jones, A. Davidson, L. Hibbert, P. Gruenwald, J. Schlaak, S. Ball, G. R. Foster, and M. Jacobs, J. Virol. 79:5414-5420, 2005). Translation of the DENV genome results in a single polypeptide, which is processed by viral and host proteases into at least 10 separate proteins. To date, no single DENV protein has been implicated in the targeting of STAT2 for decreased levels of expression. We demonstrate here that the polymerase of the virus, NS5, binds to STAT2 and is necessary and sufficient for its reduced level of expression. The decrease in protein level observed requires ubiquitination and proteasome activity, strongly suggesting an active degradation process. Furthermore, we show that the degradation of but not binding to STAT2 is dependent on the expression of the polymerase in the context of a polyprotein that undergoes proteolytic processing for NS5 maturation. Thus, the mature form of NS5, when not expressed as a precursor, was able to bind to STAT2 but was unable to target it for degradation, establishing a unique role for viral polyprotein processing in providing an additional function to a viral polypeptide. Therefore, we have identified both a novel mechanism by which DENV evades the innate immune response and a potential target for antiviral therapeutics.","Ashour, Joseph; Laurent-Rolle, Maudry; Shi, Pei-Yong; García-Sastre, Adolfo",Journal of virology,3,1

Afferent pathways from the vagus nerve, vestibular system, and chemoreceptor trigger zone project to nucleus tractus solitarius, which in turn relays signals to the central pattern generator to initiate multiple downstream pathways resulting in symptoms of nausea and vomiting. There is increasing evidence that the central pathway of chronic nausea is different from that of acute nausea and vomiting-and closely resembles that of neuropathic pain. This improved understanding of chronic nausea has resulted in a paradigm shift with regard to management strategy. Although conventional therapies such as antiemetics and prokinetics are commonly used to manage acute nausea and vomiting, they are historically not as effective in treating chronic nausea. Recently, neuromodulator agents, such as tricyclic antidepressants, gabapentin, olanzapine, mirtazapine, and benzodiazepines, and cannabinoids have been shown to be efficacious in the treatment of nausea and vomiting, and may be useful in the treatment of chronic symptoms. There is a need to study these agents, especially in the management of chronic functional nausea. Improved understanding of the central and peripheral circuitry of nausea and vomiting symptoms will allow for enhanced utilization of the currently available medications, and the development of novel therapeutic options.","Cangemi, David J; Kuo, Braden",Journal of clinical gastroenterology,3,12

However, deployment of the first-generation device (Pipeline Classic) can be technically challenging. The Pipeline Flex contains the same flow-diverting stent with a modified delivery system. OBJECTIVE To compare procedural outcomes between the first-generation device (Pipeline Classic) and the Pipeline Flex. METHODS Thirty-eight of the first 40 consecutive patients who underwent intracranial aneurysm treatment with the Pipeline Flex and 58 of the most recent 60 consecutive patients who underwent treatment with the Pipeline Classic at our institution were evaluated. Patient demographics, aneurysm characteristics, technical procedural details, and early outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS The two groups were comparable for age, gender, and location of target aneurysms. Use of Pipeline Flex decreased procedure time by 44.2 min (p≤0.001) and fluoroscopy time by 22.0 min (p=0.001) compared with the Pipeline Classic. Similarly, radiation exposure was less in the Flex group with a mean difference of 3473.5 Gy cm2 (p=0.002), while contrast usage was decreased with a mean difference of 22.3 mL (p=0.007). These differences remained significant in multivariate regression analysis. Finally, the rate of device deployment failure was lower in the Flex group (7.1%) than in the Classic group (23.9%) (p=0.034). CONCLUSIONS Use of Pipeline Flex significantly reduces the total procedure and fluoroscopy time, contrast usage, patient radiation exposure, and proportion of recaptured devices in comparison with the Pipeline Classic, probably owing to an enhanced delivery system that allows for more reliable and controlled deployment.","Le, Elizabeth J; Miller, Timothy; Serulle, Yafell; Shivashankar, Ravishankar; Jindal, Gaurav; Gandhi, Dheeraj",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,3,20

Design A prospective observational study where consecutive invasive procedures were studied over a period of 1 year and 8 months. The interventions were registered anonymously in an online database. Endpoints were success rate at first attempt, number of attempts, complications, level of supervision, and teamwork. Setting A 33-bedded mixed ICU. Subjects Advanced practice providers and medical residents. Interventions Registration of the performance of tracheal intubation, central venous and arterial access, tube thoracostomies, interhospital transportation, and electrical cardioversion. Measurement and Main Results A full-time advanced practice provider performed an average of 168 procedures and a medical resident an average of 68. The advanced practice provider inserted significant more radial, brachial, and femoral artery catheters (66% vs 74%, p = 0.17; 15% vs 12%, p = 0.14; 18% vs 14%, p = 0.14, respectively). The median number of attempts needed to successfully insert an arterial catheter was lower, and the success rate at first attempt was higher in the group treated by advanced practice providers (1.30 [interquartile range, 1-1.82] vs 1.53 [interquartile range, 1-2.27], p < 0.0001; and 71% vs 54%, p < 0.0001).

The number of intubations by advanced practice providers was 143 and by medical residents was 115 with more supervision by the advanced practice provider (10% vs 0%; p = 0.01). Team performance, as reported by nursing staff, was higher during advanced practice provider procedures compared with medical resident procedures (median, 4.85 [interquartile range, 4.85-5] vs 4.73 [interquartile range, 4.22-5]). Other procedures were also more often performed by advanced practice providers. The complication rate in the advanced practice provider-treated patient group was lower than that in the medical resident group.

Glomerular podocyte injury is a major mechanism that leads to DN. However, the mechanisms underlying podocyte injury are ambiguous. In this study, we sought to investigate the contribution of SET domain-containing protein 6 (SETD6) to the pathogenesis of podocyte injury induced by glucose (GLU) and palmitic acid (PA), as well as the underlying mechanisms. Our results showed that GLU and PA treatment significantly decreased SETD6 expression in mouse podocytes. Besides, Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) and flow cytometry assay demonstrated that silencing of SETD6 silence obviously enhanced cell viability, and suppressed apoptosis in GLU and PA-induced podocytes. We also discovered that downregulation of SETD6 suppressed GLU and PA-induced ROS generation and podocyte mitochondrial dysfunction. Nrf2-Keap1 signaling pathway was involved in the effect of SETD6 on mitochondrial dysfunction. Taken together, silencing of SETD6 protected mouse podocyte against apoptosis and mitochondrial dysfunction through activating Nrf2-Keap1 signaling pathway.

OBJECTIVES To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of pars plana vitrectomy combined with scleral buckle versus pars plana vitrectomy alone for eyes with giant retinal tear. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2018, Issue 8), which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register; Ovid MEDLINE; Embase.com; PubMed; Latin American and Caribbean Literature on Health Sciences (LILACS); ClinicalTrials.gov; and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We did not use any date or language restrictions in our electronic search. We last searched the electronic databases on 16 August 2018. SELECTION CRITERIA We included only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing pars plana vitrectomy combined with scleral buckle versus pars plana vitrectomy alone for giant retinal tear regardless of age, gender, lens status (e.g. phakic or pseudophakic eyes) of the affected eye(s), or etiology of GRT among participants enrolled in these trials. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently assessed titles and abstracts, then full-text articles, using Covidence. Any differences in classification between the two review authors were resolved through discussion. Two review authors independently abstracted data and assessed risk of bias of included trials. MAIN RESULTS We found two RCTs in abstract format (105 participants randomized). Neither RCT was published in full. Based on the data presented in the abstracts, scleral buckling might be beneficial (relative risk of re-attachement ranged from 3.0 to 4.4), but the findings are inconclusive due to a lack of peer reviewed publication and insufficient information for assessing risk of bias. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS We found no conclusive evidence from RCTs on which to base clinical recommendations for scleral buckle combined with pars plana vitrectomy for giant retinal tear. RCTs are clearly needed to address this evidence gap. Such trials should be randomized, and patients should be classified by giant retinal tear characteristics (extension (90º, 90º to 180º, > 180º), location (oral, anterior, posterior to equator)), proliferative vitreoretinopathy stage, and endotamponade. Analysis should include both short-term (three months and six months) and long-term (one year to two years) outcomes for primary retinal reattachment, mean change in best corrected visual acuity, study eyes that required second surgery for retinal reattachment, and adverse events such as elevation of intraocular pressure above 21 mmHg, choroidal detachment, cystoid macular edema, macular pucker, proliferative vitreoretinopathy, and progression of cataract in initially phakic eyes.","Gutierrez, Mario; Rodriguez, Jose L; Zamora-de La Cruz, Diego; Flores Pimentel, Mariana Aracely; Jimenez-Corona, Aida; Novak, Linda C; Cano Hidalgo, Rene; Graue, Federico",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,3,1

We hypothesized that the PPB (SpaceMaker Pro) and AAJT would result in similar rates of survival and blood loss versus OP. METHODS Thirty-two swine underwent creation of a combined open-book pelvic fracture and major iliac vascular injuries. Animals were randomized to no intervention (n = 7), OP (n = 10), PPB (n = 9), or AAJT (n = 6) at a mean arterial pressure <40 mm Hg following initiation of uncontrolled hemorrhage. Survival (up to 60 minutes + 10 minutes after intervention reversal), hemodynamics, extraperitoneal pressures, blood loss, and associated complications were compared between groups. RESULTS Prior to injury, no difference was measured between groups for weight, hemodynamics, lactate, and hematocrit (all p > 0.05). The injury was uniformly lethal without intervention, with survival time (mean) of 5 minutes, peak preperitoneal pressure (PP) of 14 mm Hg, blood loss of 960 g, and peak lactate of 2.6 mmol/L. Survival time was 44 minutes with OP versus 60 minutes with PPB and AAJT (p < 0.01). Peak PP (mm Hg) was 19 with OP, 23 with PPB, and 23 with AAJT (p > 0.05). Blood loss (g) was 850 with OP, 930 with PPB, and 600 with AAJT (p > 0.05). Peak lactate (mmol/L) was 3.3 with OP, 4.3 with PPB, and 6.3 with AAJT (p < 0.01). Only 33% of AAJT animals survived intervention reversal versus 60% for OP and 67% for PPB (p < 0.01).

Stomach cancer Adjuvant Multi-Institutional group Trial (SAMIT) was a 2×2 factorial randomised phase III study in which patients with GC were randomised to Pac-S-1 (paclitaxel +S-1), Pac-UFT (paclitaxel +UFT), S-1 alone or UFT alone after curative surgery. DESIGN The primary objective of this study was to identify a gene signature that predicts survival benefit from paclitaxel chemotherapy in GC patients. SAMIT GC samples were profiled using a customised 476 gene NanoString panel. A random forest machine-learning model was applied on the NanoString profiles to develop a gene signature. An independent cohort of metastatic patients with GC treated with paclitaxel and ramucirumab (Pac-Ram) served as an external validation cohort. RESULTS From the SAMIT trial 499 samples were analysed in this study. From the Pac-S-1 training cohort, the random forest model generated a 19-gene signature assigning patients to two groups: Pac-Sensitive and Pac-Resistant. In the Pac-UFT validation cohort, Pac-Sensitive patients exhibited a significant improvement in disease free survival (DFS): 3-year DFS 66% vs 40% (HR 0.44, p=0.0029). There was no survival difference between Pac-Sensitive and Pac-Resistant in the UFT or S-1 alone arms, test of interaction p<0.001. In the external Pac-Ram validation cohort, the signature predicted benefit for Pac-Sensitive (median PFS 147 days vs 112 days, HR 0.48, p=0.022). CONCLUSION Using machine-learning techniques on one of the largest GC trials (SAMIT), we identify a gene signature representing the first predictive biomarker for paclitaxel benefit.

Fever, coughing and dyspnea are considered the major signs of COVID-19. In addition to the involvement of the respiratory system, the infection may result in other symptoms and signs as well. Based on reports to date, neurological signs or symptoms appear in 30-50% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, with higher incidence in those with more severe disease. Classical acute neurological syndromes have also been reported to associate with COVID-19. A drop in the volume of services for other acute diseases has been described in countries with healthcare systems focusing on COVID-19. During the COVID-19 epidemic it is also important to provide appropriate continuous care for those with chronic neurological disorders. It will be the task of the future to estimate the collateral damage caused by the COVID-19 epidemic on the outcome of other neurological disorders, and to screen for the possible late neurological complications of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection.","Bereczki, Dániel; Stang, Rita; Böjti, Péter; Kovács, Tibor",Ideggyogyaszati szemle,3,17

The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of flow-diverter devices (FDDs) over a long-term follow-up period. METHODS The authors retrospectively reviewed all cerebral aneurysm cases that had been admitted to the Division of Neurosurgery of the Università degli Studi di Napoli between November 2008 and November 2015 and treated with an FDD. The records of 60 patients (48 females and 12 males) harboring 69 cerebral aneurysms were analyzed. The study end points were angiographic evidence of complete aneurysm occlusion, recanalization rate, occlusion of the parent artery, and clinical and radiological evidence of brain ischemia. The occlusion rate was evaluated according to the O'Kelly-Marotta (OKM) Scale for flow diversion, based on the degree of filling (A, total filling; B, subtotal filling; C, entry remnant; D, no filling). Postprocedural, midterm, and long-term results were strictly analyzed. RESULTS Complete occlusion (OKM D) was achieved in 63 (91%) of 69 aneurysms, partial occlusion (OKM C) in 4 (6%), occlusion of the parent artery in 2 (3%). Intraprocedural technical complications occurred in 3 patients (5%). Postprocedural complications occurred in 6 patients (10%), without neurological deficits. At the 12-month follow-up, 3 patients (5%) experienced asymptomatic cerebral infarction. No further complications were observed at later follow-up evaluations (> 24 months). There were no reports of any delayed aneurysm rupture, subarachnoid or intraparenchymal hemorrhage, ischemic complications, or procedure- or device-related deaths. CONCLUSIONS Endovascular treatment with an FDD is a safe treatment for unruptured cerebral aneurysms, resulting in a high rate of occlusion. In the present study, the authors observed effective and stable aneurysm occlusion, even at the long-term follow-up. Data in this study also suggest that ischemic complications can occur at a later stage, particularly at 12-18 months. On the other hand, no other ischemic or hemorrhagic complications occurred beyond 24 months.","Briganti, Francesco; Leone, Giuseppe; Cirillo, Luigi; de Divitiis, Oreste; Solari, Domenico; Cappabianca, Paolo",Neurosurgical focus,3,1

Due to the lack of effective therapy available for COVID-19 patients, the identification of risk factors for the severe course of the disease is a matter of urgency. Therefore, the aim of this review was to report on evidence-based risk factors affecting the severity and prognosis of COVID-19. We searched the PubMed database for current literature to identify relevant publications concerning risk factors for COVID-19 severity. Demographic and social factors (age, gender, race, in-center communities/nursing homes), clinical factors (smoking, hypertension, obesity, diabetes, chronic lung diseases, cardiovascular diseases - CVD, chronic kidney disease - CKD, malignancies, dementia, cardiomyopathies, immunocompromised state), laboratory markers (C-reactive protein - CRP, leukocytosis, ferritin, interleukin (IL)-6, D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase - LDH, aspartate aminotransferase - AST, procalcitonin, creatinine, lymphopenia, IL-2, IL-7, IL-10, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor - G-CSF, also known as colony-stimulating factor 3 - CSF 3, interferon gamma-inducible protein-10 - IP-10, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 - MCP-1, macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha - MIP1A, tumor necrosis factor alpha - TNF-α), and genetic factors related to both the virus and the host were discussed.

METHODS PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrials.gov, and medRxiv databases were searched using a search strategy tailored to each database. The Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) and Strengthening the reporting of observational studies in epidemiology (STROBE) checklists were used for the studies' qualitative assessment. The outcomes studied were mortality, all adverse events, serious adverse events, and clinical improvement. The quantitative synthesis was conducted using fixed and random effects models in the CMA 2.2. Heterogeneity was tested using the I-squared (I2) measure. RESULTS In general, six studies, including five randomized controlled trials and one cohort study were found eligible. Comparison of the findings related to both groups receiving remdesivir (10-day remdesivir group) and placebo/control group showed that remdesivir treatment had no significant effect on mortality at day 14 of the treatment (RR=0.769; 95% CI :0.563-1.050; p=0.098), and all adverse events (RR= 1.078; 95% CI: 0.908-1.279; p= 0.392). However, remdesivir had a significant effect on clinical improvement at day 14 compared to placebo/control (OR= 1.447; 95% CI: 1.005-2.085; p= 0.047) and reduced serious adverse events (RR= 0.736; 95% CI: 0.611-0.887; p= 0.001). CONCLUSION Remdesivir has positive effects on clinical improvement, and reduction of the risk of serious adverse events. However, it does not influence the mortality at day 14 of treatment.","Tasavon Gholamhoseini, Mohammad; Yazdi-Feyzabadi, Vahid; Goudarzi, Reza; Mehrolhassani, Mohammad Hossein","Journal of pharmacy & pharmaceutical sciences : a publication of the Canadian Society for Pharmaceutical Sciences, Societe canadienne des sciences pharmaceutiques",3,33

METHODS Review of a prospectively collected database of thrombectomy patients with anterior circulation strokes, adequate CT perfusion (CTP) maps, National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS)≥10 and presenting beyond 6 hours from January 2014 to October 2018. Patients were categorised according to five selection paradigms: DAWN clinical-core mismatch (DAWN-CCM): between age-adjusted NIHSS and CTP core, DEFUSE 3 perfusion imaging mismatch (DEFUSE-3-PIM): between CTP-derived perfusion defect (Tmax >6 s lesion) and ischaemic core volumes and three non-contrast CT Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS)-based criteria: age-adjusted clinical-ASPECTS mismatch (aCAM): between age-adjusted NIHSS and ASPECTS, eloquence-adjusted clinical ASPECTS mismatch (eCAM): ASPECTS 6-10 and non-involvement of the right M6 and left M4 areas and standard clinical ASPECTS mismatch (sCAM): ASPECTS 6-10. RESULTS 310 patients underwent analysis. DEFUSE-3-PIM had the highest proportion of qualifying patients followed by sCAM, eCAM, aCAM and DAWN-CCM (93.5%, 92.6%, 90.6%, 90% and 84.5%, respectively). Patients meeting aCAM, eCAM, sCAM and DAWN-CCM criteria had higher rates of 90-day good outcome compared with their non-qualifying counterparts(43.2% vs 12%,p=0.002; 42.4% vs 17.4%, p=0.02; 42.4% vs 11.2%, p=0.009; and 43.7% vs 20.5%, p=0.007, respectively). There was no difference between patients meeting DEFUSE-3-PIM criteria versus not(40.8% vs 31.3%,p=0.45). In multivariate analysis, all selection modalities except for DEFUSE-3-PIM were independently associated with 90-day good outcome. CONCLUSIONS ASPECTS-based selection paradigms for late presenting and wake-up strokes ET have comparable proportions of qualifying patients and similar 90-day functional outcomes as DAWN-CCM and DEFUSE-3-PIM. They also might lead to better outcome discrimination. These could represent a potential alternative for centres where access to advanced imaging is limited.","Bouslama, Mehdi; Haussen, Diogo C; Rodrigues, Gabriel; Barreira, Clara; Frankel, Michael; Nogueira, Raul G","Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry",3,12

We developed a pedaling exercise protocol to obtain phase contrast magnetic resonance imaging (PC-MRI) blood flow measurements in the TA and brachiocephalic arteries during three-tiered supine pedaling at 130, 150, and 170 % of resting heart rate (HR), and relate these measurements to non-invasive tissue oxygen saturation [Formula: see text] acquired by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) while conducting the same protocol. Local quantification of WSS indices by CFD revealed low time-averaged WSS on the outer curvature of the ascending aorta and the inner curvature of the descending aorta (dAo) that progressively increased with exercise, but that remained low on the anterior surface of brachiocephalic arteries. High oscillatory WSS observed on the inner curvature of the aorta persisted during exercise as well. Results suggest locally continuous exposure to potentially deleterious indices of WSS despite benefits of exercise. Linear relationships between flow distributions and tissue oxygen extraction calculated from [Formula: see text] were found between the left common carotid versus cerebral tissue [Formula: see text] and the dAo versus leg tissue [Formula: see text]. A resulting six-step procedure is presented to use NIRS data as a surrogate for exercise PC-MRI when setting boundary conditions for future CFD studies of the TA under simulated exercise conditions.

Within this context, the ability of pain specialists to accurately diagnose and plan appropriate interventional spine procedures based entirely on telemedicine visits, without an in-person evaluation, remains to be established. In this study, our primary objective was to assess the relevance of telemedicine to interventional spine procedure planning by determining whether procedure plans established solely from virtual visits changed following in-person evaluation. METHODS We reviewed virtual and in-person clinical encounters from our academic health system's 10 interventional spine specialists. We included patients who were seen exclusively via telemedicine encounters and indicated for an interventional procedure with documented procedural plans. Virtual plans were then compared with the actual procedures performed following in-person evaluation. Demographic data as well as the type and extent of physical examination performed by the interventional spine specialist were also recorded. RESULTS Of the 87 new patients included, the mean age was 60 years (SE 1.4 years) and the preprocedural plan established by telemedicine, primarily videoconferencing, did not change for 76 individuals (87%; 95% CI 0.79 to 0.94) following in-person evaluation. Based on the size of our sample, interventional procedures indicated solely during telemedicine encounters may be accurate in 79%-94% of cases in the broader population. CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that telemedicine evaluations are a generally accurate means of preprocedural assessment and development of interventional spine procedure plans. These findings clearly demonstrate the capabilities of telemedicine for evaluating spine patients and planning interventional spine procedures.","Crawford, Alexander M; Lightsey, Harry M; Xiong, Grace X; Striano, Brendan M; Greene, Nattaly; Schoenfeld, Andrew J; Simpson, Andrew K",Regional anesthesia and pain medicine,3,16

As a result, the initial experience of a surgeon with advanced MIS HPB training at a national cancer center was reviewed. METHODS The experience of a surgeon with the first 50 laparoscopic hepatectomies for cancer was reviewed retrospectively. All cases begun with the intention to complete the hepatectomy laparoscopically were included in the laparoscopic group. RESULTS From November 2008 to October 2010, a total of 57 hepatectomies were performed, with 53 attempted laparoscopically. Of these 57 hepatectomies, 46 (87%) were completed laparoscopically, 4 (7%) required hand assistance, and 3 (6%) were converted to an open approach. Laparoscopic minor hepatectomies were performed for 28 patients and laparoscopic major hepatectomies for 25 patients. The mean operative time was 265 min, and the mean estimated blood loss was 300 ml. The mean hospital stay was 7 days. Complications occurred for six patients (11%) (2 bile leaks, 2 hemorrhages requiring conversion, 1 hernia requiring a hernia repair on postoperative day 7, and 1 ileus managed nonoperatively). CONCLUSIONS Surgeons with advanced MIS HPB training may be able to perform a higher percentage of their hepatectomies laparoscopically. Training in both open and laparoscopic HPB surgery is advisable before these techniques are performed.","Gumbs, Andrew A; Tsai, Tzu-jung; Hoffman, John P",Surgical endoscopy,3,16

Intensive care unit (ICU) nurses are at risk of burnout and the COVID-19 pandemic may increase this risk. The objectives of this study were to assess the prevalence of burnout risk and identify risk factors among ICU nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESEARCH METHODOLOGY Web-based survey performed during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in French speaking Belgium. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Risk of burnout was assessed with the Maslach Burnout Inventory scale. RESULTS A total of 1135 ICU nurses responded to the questionnaire. The overall prevalence of burnout risk was 68%. A total of 29% of ICU nurses were at risk of depersonalisation (DP), 31% of reduced personal accomplishment (PA), and 38% of emotional exhaustion (EE). A 1:3 nurse-to-patient ratio increased the risk of EE (OR = 1.77, 95% CI: 1.07-2.95) and DP (OR = 1.38, 95% CI: 1.09-2.40). Those who reported having a higher perceived workload during the COVID-19 pandemic were at higher risk for all dimensions of burnout. Shortage of personal protective equipment increased the risk of EE (OR = 1.78, 95% CI: 1.35-3.34) and nurses who reported having symptoms of COVID-19 without being tested were at higher risk of EE (OR = 1.40, 95% CI: 1.68-1.87). CONCLUSIONS Two-thirds of ICU nurses were at risk of burnout and this risk was associated with their working conditions during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.

METHODS Forty-nine second-year student pharmacists were enrolled in a pharmacy communication laboratory course and 8 undergraduate students were recruited during Fall 2019. The first communication laboratory interaction consisted of student pharmacists using their normal mode of communication with role-played patients who are deaf/hard of hearing to establish baseline measures; a pretest survey was administered to each participant at the conclusion of this 10-minute laboratory interaction. In the second laboratory interaction, student pharmacists used the app to assist in communicating with the simulated patients who are deaf/hard of hearing. Posttests were administered at the conclusion of this laboratory interaction. RESULTS Most student pharmacists and simulated patients who are deaf/hard of hearing reported feeling able to effectively communicate their needs to the other individual in their dyad (pharmacist or patient) during their health care interactions. Using an iPad (Apple Inc) app to communicate significantly increased student pharmacist and simulated patient comfort with health care communication from preintervention to postintervention.

Herein, molecular dynamics simulations were performed to investigate the effect of MoS2 nanotube on the binding of the signal protein YAP65, an important Yes kinase-associated protein domain (WW domain), to the proline rich motif ligand (PRM). We designed four systems based on the different initial binding modes among WW domain, PRM and MoS2 nanotube, and observed two ways to affect the binding of WW domain to PRM. The first pathway, the active site in WW domain was occupied by MoS2 nanotube, which prevents WW domain from binding to PRM. In the second pathway, WW domain was bound to PRM with residues W17 and F29 instead of the two highly conserved residues (Y28 and W39), forming an unstable combination. These two results might cause WW domain to lose its original function or to pass the mistaken signal. However, MoS2 nanotube did not destroy the structure and binding of WW domain and PRM in the composite. These findings shed light on the interaction between MoS2 nanotube and signal protein system, while providing another valuable insight into the potential nanotoxicity of MoS2 nanotube.","Meng, Yajie; Liu, Ruirui; Zhu, Min; Zhai, Honglin; Ren, Cuiling","Colloids and surfaces.

The thoracoscopic portion is generally performed in the left lateral decubitus position. Recently there has been increasing interest in esophageal mobilization in the prone position and the potential benefits of this technique with regard to operative time, surgeon ergonomics, and operative exposure. We sought to objectively compare thoracoscopic mobilization of the esophagus in the left lateral decubitus position versus the prone position and identify potential differences between the two techniques. METHODS A retrospective review of a prospectively maintained esophagectomy database identified 44 patients undergoing MIE during a 20-month period (June 2005-February 2007). Of these, 32 patients underwent thoracoscopic esophageal mobilization with cervical esophagogastric anastomosis. Eleven cases were performed in the left lateral decubitus position and 21 performed in the prone position. RESULTS The patients were comparable in age, tumor stage, and fraction undergoing neoadjuvant therapy. There was no statistically significant difference between decubitus position and prone position with regard to number of lymph nodes procured (14.6 versus 15.5, p = 0.69), complications (6/11 versus 10/21, p = 1.0), length of stay (9 versus 10 days, p = 1.0), or intraoperative blood loss (85 versus 65 cc, p = 0.14). Thoracoscopic operative times were significantly shorter in the prone group than the decubitus group (86 versus 123 min, p = 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS Prone thoracoscopic esophageal mobilization appears to be equivalent to decubitus thoracoscopic esophageal mobilization with respect to blood loss, number of lymph nodes dissected, and complications, but with a significant reduction in thoracoscopic surgical time.","Fabian, Thomas; Martin, Jeremiah; Katigbak, Mario; McKelvey, Alicia A; Federico, John A",Surgical endoscopy,3,1

Neurological examination, imaging and biochemical markers are helpful tools accepted as reliable in predicting recovery. With the advent of therapeutic hypothermia, these data need to be reconfirmed. In this study, we attempted to determine the validity of different markers, which can be used in the detection of patients with poor prognosis under hypothermia. METHODS Data from adult patients admitted to our intensive care unit for a hypothermia protocol after cardiac arrest were recorded prospectively to generate a descriptive and analytical study analyzing the relationship between clinical, neurophysiological, imaging and biochemical parameters with 6-month outcomes defined according to the Cerebral Performance Categories scale (good 1-2, poor 3-5). Neuron-specific enolase was collected at 72 hours. Imaging and neurophysiologic exams were carried out in the 24 hours after the rewarming period. RESULTS Sixty-seven patients were included in the study, of which 12 had good neurological outcomes.

Patients who had more rapid cooling (mean time of 163 versus 312 minutes), hypoxic-ischemic brain injury on magnetic resonance imaging or neuron-specific enolase > 58ng/mL had poor neurological outcomes (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION Hypoxic-ischemic brain injury on magnetic resonance imaging and neuron-specific enolase were strong predictors of poor neurological outcomes. Although there is the belief that early achievement of target temperature improves neurological prognoses, in our study, there were increased mortality and worse neurological outcomes with earlier target-temperature achievement.","Leão, Rodrigo Nazário; Ávila, Paulo; Cavaco, Raquel; Germano, Nuno; Bento, Luís",Revista Brasileira de terapia intensiva,3,1

However, if factors affecting educational attainment - many of which are unobservable, e.g. motivation and genetic endowment - also affect the likelihood of engaging in behaviours that enhance health, then assumed effects of schooling will be inflated in analyses that do not address this endogeneity. This systematic review assesses evidence for a causal link between education and maternal and child health in low and middle-income countries. METHODS Eligible studies controlled for observable and unobservable factors affecting both education and health. Reported effects were converted into partial correlations. When possible, we also conducted meta-analyses to estimate mean effects by outcome. RESULTS Of 4952 papers identified, 16 met the inclusion criteria. The 15 child health papers examined neonatal, infant and child mortality, stunting and wasting. Significant effects of education on infant and child health were observed for 30 of 33 models that did not account for endogeneity. In contrast, only 18 of 46 effects were significant in models that addressed endogeneity. Notably, for only one outcome -child mortality measured dichotomously -was the effect of maternal educational attainment significant in a meta-analysis. The one maternal morbidity paper found significant effects for the two preventable outcomes considered. CONCLUSION While we find evidence for a causal link between education and health, effects are weaker in models that address endogeneity compared to naïve models that do not account for unobservable factors affecting both education and health. Advances in women's educational outcomes have undoubtedly played a role in improving health in many settings; however, the effect is not as strong as some researchers and advocates have claimed.","Mensch, Barbara S; Chuang, Erica K; Melnikas, Andrea J; Psaki, Stephanie R",Tropical medicine & international health : TM & IH,3,30

Several host cells are available for this purpose, ranging from Escherichia coli to mammalian cell lines. This article highlights the benefits of using yeast as the recombinant host. KEY FINDINGS The yeast species, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pichia pastoris, have been used to optimize the functional yields of potential antigens for the development of subunit vaccines against a wide range of diseases caused by bacteria and viruses. Saccharomyces cerevisiae has also been used in the manufacture of 11 approved vaccines against hepatitis B virus and one against human papillomavirus; in both cases, the recombinant protein forms highly immunogenic virus-like particles. SUMMARY Advances in our understanding of how a yeast cell responds to the metabolic load of producing recombinant proteins will allow us to identify host strains that have improved yield properties and enable the synthesis of more challenging antigens that cannot be produced in other systems. Yeasts therefore have the potential to become important host organisms for the production of recombinant antigens that can be used in the manufacture of subunit vaccines or in new vaccine development.","Bill, Roslyn M",The Journal of pharmacy and pharmacology,3,1

It is quite difficult at present to experimentally measure the instantaneous velocity and pressure at specific points in the human airway. On the other hand, direct numerical simulation (DNS) can predict all the flow properties and resolve all its relevant length- and time-scales. We developed a DNS solver with the state-of-the-art lattice Boltzmann method (LBM), and used it to investigate the flow in two patient-specific UAs reconstructed from CT scan data. Inspiration and expiration flows through these two airways are studied. The time-averaged first spatial derivative of pressure (pressure gradient), ∂p/∂z, is used to locate the region of the UA obstruction. But the time-averaged second spatial derivative, ∂(2)p/∂z(2), is used to pinpoint the exact location of the obstruction. The present results show that the DNS-LBM solver can be used to obtain accurate flow details in the UA and is a powerful tool to locate its obstruction.","Wang, Yong; Elghobashi, S",Respiratory physiology & neurobiology,3,7

We understand that some of these discussions revealed important weaknesses in relation to the approach to basic health knowledge, such as those related to epidemiology and public health measures. We seek in this essay, without the intention of exhausting the subject or performing an academic prescription, to support our position regarding the urgency of the approach of PE training within the field of Public Health, as well as presenting some proposals for this approach to effectively occur. We advocate training that favors a broader view of health, that enables professionals in the field to understand the potential relationship between PE and health, but at the same time recognize that physical activity is not a panacea and that human health has many others determinants and conditions.","Loch, Mathias Roberto; Rech, Cassiano Ricardo; Costa, Filipe Ferreira da",Ciencia & saude coletiva,3,1

This study evaluated variations in the treatment of coronary artery disease according to time course of the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan.Methods and Results:The Japanese Association of Cardiovascular Intervention and Therapeutics performed serial surveys during the pandemic (in mid-April, late-April and mid-May 2020) with queries regarding the implementation of PCI. Hospitals were asked about their treatment strategies for elective PCI and emergency PCI for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and high-risk acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients. Most hospitals opted to perform primary PCI in the usual manner at the beginning of the pandemic. As the pandemic progressed, hospitals in the 7 populated areas downgraded the performance of PCI for chronic coronary syndrome and high-risk ACS, but not for STEMI patients. After the state of emergency was lifted in most prefectures in mid-May, the rate of PCI gradually normalized. Screening tests, such as polymerase chain reaction and chest computed tomography, in ACS were frequently used. CONCLUSIONS The COVID-19 pandemic greatly affected PCI treatment in Japan. However, even in the most critical situations during the pandemic, most institutions continued to perform primary PCI normally for STEMI patients.","Ishii, Hideki; Amano, Tetsuya; Yamaji, Kyohei; Kohsaka, Shun; Yokoi, Hiroyoshi; Ikari, Yuji",Circulation journal : official journal of the Japanese Circulation Society,3,5

We estimated the impact of such strategies on epidemic and mortality risk using the UK as a case study. Methods: ​ We used an individual based model for a synthetic population similar to the UK, stratified into transmission risks from the community, within the household and from other households in the same social bubble. The base case considers a situation where non-essential shops and schools are closed, the secondary household attack rate is 20% and the initial reproduction number is 0.8. We simulate social bubble strategies (where two households form an exclusive pair) for households including children, for single occupancy households, and for all households. We test the sensitivity of results to a range of alternative model assumptions and parameters. Results: Clustering contacts outside the household into exclusive bubbles is an effective strategy of increasing contacts while limiting the associated increase in epidemic risk. In the base case, social bubbles reduced fatalities by 42% compared to an unclustered increase of contacts. We find that if all households were to form social bubbles the reproduction number would likely increase to above the epidemic threshold of R=1. Strategies allowing households with young children or single occupancy households to form social bubbles increased the reproduction number by less than 11%. The corresponding increase in mortality is proportional to the increase in the epidemic risk but is focussed in older adults irrespective of inclusion in social bubbles. Conclusions: ​ If managed appropriately, social bubbles can be an effective way of extending contacts beyond the household while limiting the increase in epidemic risk.","Leng, Trystan; White, Connor; Hilton, Joe; Kucharski, Adam; Pellis, Lorenzo; Stage, Helena; Davies, Nicholas G; Keeling, Matt J; Flasche, Stefan",Wellcome open research,3,1

METHODS In a multicenter IVT-register-based cohort study, we compared previously dependent (prestroke modified Rankin Scale score, 3-5) versus independent (prestroke modified Rankin Scale score, 0-2) patients. Outcome measures were poor 3-month outcome (not reaching at least prestroke modified Rankin Scale [dependent patients]; modified Rankin Scale score of 3-6 [independent patients]), death, and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage. Unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (OR [95% confidence interval]) were calculated. RESULTS Among 7430 IVT-treated patients, 489 (6.6%) were dependent and 6941 (93.4%) were independent. Previous stroke, dementia, heart, and bone diseases were the most common causes of preexisting dependency. Dependent patients were more likely to die (ORunadjusted, 4.55 [3.74-5.53]; ORadjusted, 2.19 [1.70-2.84]). Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage occurred equally frequent (4.8% versus 4.5%). Poor outcome was more frequent in dependent (60.5%) than in independent (39.6%) patients, but the adjusted ORs were similar (ORadjusted, 0.95 [0.75-1.21]). Among survivors, the proportion of patients with poor outcome did not differ (35.7% versus 31.3%). After adjustment for age and stroke severity, the odds of poor outcome were lower in dependent patients (ORadjusted, 0.64 [0.49-0.84]). CONCLUSIONS IVT-treated stroke patients who were dependent on the daily help of others before stroke carry a higher mortality risk than previously independent patients. The risk of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage and the likelihood of poor outcome were not independently influenced by previous dependency. Among survivors, poor outcome was avoided at least as effectively in previously dependent patients. Thus, withholding IVT in previously dependent patients might not be justified.","Gensicke, Henrik; Strbian, Daniel; Zinkstok, Sanne M; Scheitz, Jan F; Bill, Olivier; Hametner, Christian; Moulin, Solène; Zini, Andrea; Kägi, Georg; Pezzini, Alessandro; Padjen, Visnja; Béjot, Yannick; Corbiere, Sydney; Zonneveld, Thomas P; Seiffge, David J; Roos, Yvo B; Traenka, Christopher; Putaala, Jukka; Peters, Nils; Bonati, Leo H; Curtze, Sami; Erdur, Hebun; Sibolt, Gerli; Koch, Peter; Vandelli, Laura; Ringleb, Peter; Leys, Didier; Cordonnier, Charlotte; Michel, Patrik; Nolte, Christian H; Lyrer, Philippe A; Tatlisumak, Turgut; Nederkoorn, Paul J; Engelter, Stefan T",Stroke,3,1

An oral dose (50 or 100mg) of TRA was administered to 17 healthy volunteers. Hair samples were collected prior to drug administration and 14, 30, 60 and 120 days after ingestion. Each sample was segmented in 5mm segments and washed. The analytes were extracted from pulverized hair by incubation in extraction media for 18h at 37°C. A validated UHPLC-MS/MS method was used to quantify the analytes at a LLOQ of 0.001ng/mg. Hair segments corresponding to the time of ingestion were positive for TRA and the metabolites of each sampling time point, although neighboring segments also showed positive results. The highest concentrations for both dosage groups were observed in the proximal segment of hair collected 14 days after ingestion for all subjects: 0.061-0.95ng TRA/mg, 0.012-0.86ng NDMT/mg and 0.009-0.17ng ODMT/mg (n=16). Generally, the TRA concentration was higher than the metabolites concentrations but depended on the CYP2D6 phenotype. The metabolite to TRA ratios were stable within a subject over the sampling time points, however it varied greatly between subjects. No significant differences in hair concentrations were found between the two dosage groups at each sampling time. Several confounding factors were identified such as hair pigmentation and internal sweat. We showed that analysis of 5mm segments improved the determination of the exposure time after a single ingestion of TRA. In addition, in the later sampling time points the analytes were spread more between segments and the total drug amount of each later sampling time point declined up to a 100% (median: 75%) due to wash out. The presented results are important additions to the sparse literature reporting single dose of psychoactive drugs in hair.","Johansen, Sys Stybe; Dang, Linda Tuong Vy Le; Nielsen, Marie Katrine Klose; Haage, Pernilla; Kugelberg, Fredrik Carl; Kronstrand, Robert",Forensic science international,3,1

Access to HIV services remains low among this group although several effective interventions have been documented. It is therefore important to identify what has worked well to increase the reach of HIV services among MSM. METHODS We searched MEDLINE, POPLINE and the Web of Science databases to collect published articles reporting HIV interventions among MSM across sub-Saharan Africa. Covidence was used to review the articles. The review protocol was registered in International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) - CRD42017060808. RESULTS The search identified 2627 citations, and following removal of duplicates and inclusion and exclusion criteria, only 15 papers were eligible for inclusion in the review. The articles reported various accrual strategies, namely: respondent driven sampling, known peers identified through hotspot or baseline surveys, engagement with existing community-based organizations, and through peer educators contacting MSM in virtual sites. Some programs, however, combined some of these accrual strategies. Peer-led outreach services were indicated to reach and deliver services to more MSM. A combination of peer outreach and mobile clinics increased uptake of health information and services. Health facilities, especially MSM-friendly facilities attract access and use of services by MSM and retention into care. CONCLUSIONS There are various strategies for accrual and delivering services to MSM across SSA. However, each of these strategies have specific strengths and weaknesses necessitating combinations of interventions and integration of the specific context to inform implementation. If the best of intervention content and implementation are used to inform these services, sufficient coverage and impact of HIV prevention and treatment programs for MSM across SSA can be optimized.","Nyato, Daniel; Kuringe, Evodius; Drake, Mary; Casalini, Caterina; Nnko, Soori; Shao, Amani; Komba, Albert; Baral, Stefan D; Wambura, Mwita; Changalucha, John",BMC public health,3,22

Previously we have shown that CAP generated with a flexible surface Dielectric Barrier Discharge (sDBD) is highly effective against bacteria in vitro and in ex vivo burn wound models. In the current paper, we determined the in vitro and in vivo safety and efficacy of CAP generated by this sDBD device. METHODS The effect of CAP on DNA mutations of V79 fibroblasts was measured using a hypoxanthine-guanine-phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) assay. Furthermore, effects on cell proliferation, apoptosis and DNA damage in ex vivo burn wound models (BWMs) were assessed using immunohistochemistry. Next, 105 colony forming units (CFU) P. aeruginosa strain PAO1 were exposed to CAP in a 3D collagen-elastin matrix environment to determine the number of surviving bacteria in vitro. Finally, rat excision wounds were inoculated with 107 CFU PAO1 for 24 h. The wounds received a single CAP treatment, repeated treatments on 4 consecutive days with CAP, 100 µL of 1% (wt/wt) silver sulfadiazine or no treatment. Wound swabs and punch biopsies were taken to determine the number of surviving bacteria. RESULTS Exposure of V79 fibroblasts to CAP did not increase the numbers of mutated colonies. Additionally, the number of proliferative, apoptotic and DNA damaged cells in the BWMs was comparable to that of the unexposed control. Exposure of PAO1 to CAP for 2 min resulted in the complete elimination of bacteria in vitro. Contrarily, CAP treatment for 6 min of rat wounds colonized with PAO1 did not effectively reduce the in vivo bacterial count. CONCLUSIONS CAP treatment was safe but showed limited efficacy against PAO1 in our rat wound infection model.","Dijksteel, Gabrielle S; Ulrich, Magda M W; Vlig, Marcel; Sobota, Ana; Middelkoop, Esther; Boekema, Bouke K H L",Annals of clinical microbiology and antimicrobials,3,1

OBJECTIVE To investigate preparation, response, and economic impact of COVID-19 on private, public, academic, and privademic spine surgeons. METHODS AO Spine COVID-19 and Spine Surgeon Global Impact Survey includes domains on surgeon demographics, location of practice, type of practice, COVID-19 perceptions, institutional preparedness and response, personal and practice impact, and future perceptions. The survey was distributed by AO Spine via email to members (n = 3805). Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify differences between practice settings. RESULTS A total of 902 surgeons completed the survey. In all, 45.4% of respondents worked in an academic setting, 22.9% in privademics, 16.1% in private practice, and 15.6% in public hospitals. Academic practice setting was independently associated with performing elective and emergent spine surgeries at the time of survey distribution. A majority of surgeons reported a >75% decrease in case volume. Private practice and privademic surgeons reported losing income at a higher rate compared with academic or public surgeons. Practice setting was associated with personal protective equipment availability and economic issues as a source of stress. CONCLUSIONS The current study indicates that practice setting affected both preparedness and response to COVID-19. Surgeons in private and privademic practices reported increased worry about the economic implications of the current crisis compared with surgeons in academic and public hospitals.

The sequestration was located in the left lower basal segments (segments 9 and 10) and was treated successfully by robot-assisted segmental resection without complication. DISCUSSION Recently, robot- assisted thoracoscopic lobar resections started to be performed for ILS. The sublobar, segmental resection are reserved mainly for the resection of pulmonary nodules. We report a first case of robot-assisted anatomical segmental resection for ILS. CONCLUSION We highlight the role of robotic technology offering three-dimensional view and excellent dexterity enhancing the surgical performance and getting the surgical procedure more precise and safer. This could be useful especially in case of challenging sublobar resections.","Konecna, J; Karenovics, W; Veronesi, G; Triponez, F",International journal of surgery case reports,3,1

Adults (N = 267) reporting significant SA symptoms were recruited online and randomized to a brief, single-session online intervention: Education consisted of brief psychoeducation and treatment resources, or Education+Motivation which added treatment seeking-focused motivational content adapted from Motivational Interviewing and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy. Attitudes, intentions, perceived control, and treatment seeking were assessed at Pre, Post, and 1-month follow-up (FU). Both interventions were feasible (90% completion) and improved all outcomes. At FU, 70% reported engaging in one or more SA treatment-seeking behaviors. Education+Motivation was more effective than Education at improving treatment-seeking attitudes and behaviors. A brief online intervention with educational and motivational content is a promising direction for promoting treatment seeking for adults with SA symptoms.","Tobias, Margaret R; Landy, Lauren N; Levin, Michael E; Arch, Joanna J",Behavior modification,3,1

The OC43 strain (HCoV-OC43) was reported to induce neuronal cell death, which may participate in neuropathogenesis. Here, we show that HCoV-OC43 harboring two point mutations in the spike glycoprotein (rOC/Us183-241) was more neurovirulent than the wild-type HCoV-OC43 (rOC/ATCC) in mice and induced more cell death in murine and human neuronal cells. To evaluate the role of regulated cell death (RCD) in HCoV-OC43-mediated neural pathogenesis, we determined if knockdown of Bax, a key regulator of apoptosis, or RIP1, a key regulator of necroptosis, altered the percentage of neuronal cell death following HCoV-OC43 infection. We found that Bax-dependent apoptosis did not play a significant role in RCD following infection, as inhibition of Bax expression mediated by RNA interference did not confer cellular protection against the cell death process. On the other hand, we demonstrated that RIP1 and MLKL were involved in neuronal cell death, as RIP1 knockdown and chemical inhibition of MLKL significantly increased cell survival after infection. Taken together, these results indicate that RIP1 and MLKL contribute to necroptotic cell death after HCoV-OC43 infection to limit viral replication. However, this RCD could lead to neuronal loss in the mouse CNS and accentuate the neuroinflammation process, reflecting the severity of neuropathogenesis. IMPORTANCE Because they are naturally neuroinvasive and neurotropic, human coronaviruses are suspected to participate in the development of neurological diseases. Given that the strain OC43 is neurovirulent in mice and induces neuronal cell death, we explored the neuronal response to infection by characterizing the activation of RCD. Our results revealed that classical apoptosis associated with the Bax protein does not play a significant role in HCoV-OC43-induced neuronal cell death and that RIP1 and MLKL, two cellular proteins usually associated with necroptosis (an RCD back-up system when apoptosis is not adequately induced), both play a pivotal role in the process. As necroptosis disrupts cellular membranes and allows the release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMP) and possibly induces the production of proinflammatory cytokines, it may represent a proinflammatory cell death mechanism that contributes to excessive neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration and eventually to neurological disorders after a coronavirus infection.","Meessen-Pinard, Mathieu; Le Coupanec, Alain; Desforges, Marc; Talbot, Pierre J",Journal of virology,3,1

Recent clinical trials exploring the efficacy of ex vivo modified autologous DC-based vaccines have reported some promising results. However, in vitro generation of autologous DCs for clinical administration, their loading with tumor associated antigens (TAAs) and their activation, is laborious and expensive, and, as a result of inter-individual variability in the personalized vaccines, remains poorly standardized. An attractive alternative approach is to load resident DCs in vivo by targeted delivery of TAAs, using viral vectors and activating them simultaneously. To this end, we have constructed genetically-modified adenoviral (Ad) vectors and bispecific adaptor molecules to retarget Ad vectors encoding TAAs to the CD40 receptor on DCs. Pre-clinical human and murine studies conducted so far have clearly demonstrated the suitability of a 'two-component' (i.e. Ad and adaptor molecule) configuration for targeted modification of DCs in vivo for cancer immunotherapy. This review summarizes recent progress in the development of CD40-targeted Ad-based cancer vaccines and highlights pre-clinical issues in the clinical translation of this approach.","Hangalapura, Basav N; Timares, Laura; Oosterhoff, Dinja; Scheper, Rik J; Curiel, David T; de Gruijl, Tanja D",The journal of gene medicine,3,1

The second purpose of our study was to compare the initial effects in terms of tumour necrosis of this new combined therapy with those obtained in a matched population treated with TACE alone in a singlestep treatment in our centre in the previous year. METHODS AND MATERIALS This pilot study was approved by the institutional review board, and informed consent was obtained from all patients. Ten consecutive patients with multinodular (two to six nodules) unilobar unresectable HCC and with a main target lesion >3 cm (range, 3.5-6 cm) not suitable for curative therapy were enrolled in our single-centre multidisciplinary pilot study. The schedule consisted of percutaneous RFA (single 3-cm monopolar needle insertion) of the target lesion during occlusion of the hepatic artery supplying the tumour, followed by selective TACE, plus lobar TACE for other lesions (450-mg carboplatin and lipiodol plus temporary embolisation with SPONGOSTAN). Adverse events and intra- and periprocedural complications were clinically assessed. Early local efficacy was evaluated on 1-month follow-up multiphasic computed tomography (CT) on the basis of the Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (m-RECIST). A separate evaluation of target lesions in terms of enhancement, necrotic diameter and presence and distribution of lipiodol uptake was also performed. RESULTS No major complications occurred. Overall technical success, defined as complete devascularisation of all nodules during the arterial phase, was achieved in seven of 10 patients, with three cases of partial response (persistence of small hypervascular nodules). When considering only target lesions, technical success was obtained in all patients, with a nonenhancing area corresponding in shape to the previously identified HCC (necrotic diameter, 3.5-5 cm) and with circumferential peripheral lipiodol uptake (safety margin) of at least 0.5 cm (0.5-1.3cm). CONCLUSIONS TACE and BO-RFA, plus TACE in a singlestep approach seems to be a safe and effective combined therapy for treating advanced, unresectable HCC lesions, allowing a high rate of complete local response to be achieved in large lesions also.","Iezzi, R; Cesario, V; Siciliani, L; Campanale, M; De Gaetano, A M; Siciliano, M; Agnes, S; Giuliante, F; Grieco, A; Pompili, M; Rapaccini, G L; Gasbarrini, A; Bonomo, L",La Radiologia medica,3,5

OBJECTIVE To evaluate the clinical effectiveness of a perioperative, cardiac output-guided hemodynamic therapy algorithm. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS OPTIMISE was a pragmatic, multicenter, randomized, observer-blinded trial of 734 high-risk patients aged 50 years or older undergoing major gastrointestinal surgery at 17 acute care hospitals in the United Kingdom. An updated systematic review and meta-analysis were also conducted including randomized trials published from 1966 to February 2014. INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomly assigned to a cardiac output-guided hemodynamic therapy algorithm for intravenous fluid and inotrope (dopexamine) infusion during and 6 hours following surgery (n=368) or to usual care (n=366). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was a composite of predefined 30-day moderate or major complications and mortality. Secondary outcomes were morbidity on day 7; infection, critical care-free days, and all-cause mortality at 30 days; all-cause mortality at 180 days; and length of hospital stay. RESULTS Baseline patient characteristics, clinical care, and volumes of intravenous fluid were similar between groups. Care was nonadherent to the allocated treatment for less than 10% of patients in each group. The primary outcome occurred in 36.6% of intervention and 43.4% of usual care participants (relative risk [RR], 0.84 [95% CI, 0.71-1.01]; absolute risk reduction, 6.8% [95% CI, -0.3% to 13.9%]; P = .07). There was no significant difference between groups for any secondary outcomes. Five intervention patients (1.4%) experienced cardiovascular serious adverse events within 24 hours compared with none in the usual care group. Findings of the meta-analysis of 38 trials, including data from this study, suggest that the intervention is associated with fewer complications (intervention, 488/1548 [31.5%] vs control, 614/1476 [41.6%]; RR, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.71-0.83]) and a nonsignificant reduction in hospital, 28-day, or 30-day mortality (intervention, 159/3215 deaths [4.9%] vs control, 206/3160 deaths [6.5%]; RR, 0.82 [95% CI, 0.67-1.01]) and mortality at longest follow-up (intervention, 267/3215 deaths [8.3%] vs control, 327/3160 deaths [10.3%]; RR, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.74-1.00]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In a randomized trial of high-risk patients undergoing major gastrointestinal surgery, use of a cardiac output-guided hemodynamic therapy algorithm compared with usual care did not reduce a composite outcome of complications and 30-day mortality. However, inclusion of these data in an updated meta-analysis indicates that the intervention was associated with a reduction in complication rates.

METHODS This study analyzed transplant outcomes during the pre-pandemic [PPE, 1/2019-2/2020] and pandemic era [PE, 3/2020-8/2020] based on changes in induction immunosuppression. During PPE, high immunological risk patients received 4-6 mg/kg, moderate risk 2-4mg/kg, and low risk 1-2 mg/kg of ATG. During PE, ATG doses were reduced to 3-4 mg/kg for high risk, 1-2 mg/kg for moderate, and low changed to basiliximab. Primary outcomes: biopsy-proven rejection [BPAR], de-novo donor-specific antibody [DSA], delayed graft function [DGF], infection rates, graft loss, and all-cause of mortality. RESULTS During PPE, 224 kidney transplants [KTx], 14 kidney/pancreas transplants [KP] were included, while 180 KTx, 5 KP were included for PE. Basiliximab use increased by 30% in the PE. The odds of DGF were statistically significant between PE vs PPE, OR 1.7 [1.05, 2.8, p-value=0.042]. The odds of developing DSAs and BPAR during the PE versus PPE was 0.34 [0.16, 0.71, p-value = 0.004] and OR 0.34 (0.1 to 1.1, p-value, 0.104)] respectively. Cytomegalovirus [19% in PE, 37% in PPE] and BK virus [5.4% PE vs. 16% PPE] incidence reduced during PE versus PPE. COVID-19, graft loss, and mortality were comparable between groups.

NIBB is not invasive but maintains a high level of precision by using breast immobilization via breast compression and image-guidance, and therefore does not require large PTV margins. We present the primary outcomes of this prospective phase II study (XXXXX). METHODS Eligible patients with early-stage breast cancer underwent NIBB APBI using a dose 34Gy in 10 fractions delivered daily or BID. Treatment was delivered using an Ir-192 HDR source via specialized applicators. Two orthogonal treatment axes were used for each fraction. The primary endpoints were late toxicity and cosmesis assessed at 2 and 5 years. Toxicity was assessed using CTCAE v3.0. Cosmesis was assessed using the NRG/RTOG scale. Ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) was defined as any recurrence or new primary in the treated breast. RESULTS 40 patients underwent protocol treatment. Median patient age was 68yrs (50-92yrs). Mean tumor size was 1.1cm (0.3-3.0cm) with 62.5% invasive carcinoma and 37.5% DCIS. 39% elected to receive endocrine therapy. No grade ≥ 3 late toxicities were observed at any time point. Grade 2 toxicity was 5% and 10% at 2 and 5 years, respectively. Telangiectasia grade 1 and 2 occurred in 27.5% and 5%, respectively. Breast separation of >7cm was associated with telangiectasia, p<0.01. Good to excellent cosmetic outcome was 95% at 2 years and 100% at 5 years. With a median follow up of 68 months, the actuarial 5-year freedom-from-IBTR was 93.3% (+/-4.8%) and OS was 93.7% (+/-4.4%). CONCLUSION NIBB to deliver APBI is well tolerated with a low incidence of significant late toxicity and has favorable cosmetic outcomes. Continued evaluation of the NIBB APBI technique in a larger cohort is warranted.","Hepel, Jaroslaw T; Leonard, Kara L; Sha, Sandra; Graves, Theresa A; Wiggins, Doreen L; Mastras, Dean; Pittier, Ann; Wazer, David E","International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",3,27

Human coronaviruses are recognized to cause up to a third of common colds and are suspected to be involved in enteric and neurologic diseases. Coronavirus replication involves the generation of nested subgenomic mRNAs (sgmRNAs) with a common capped 5' leader sequence. The translation of most of the sgmRNAs is thought to be cap dependent and displays a requirement for eukaryotic initiation factor 4F (eIF4F), a heterotrimeric complex needed for the recruitment of 40S ribosomes. We recently reported on an ultrahigh-throughput screen to discover compounds that inhibit eIF4F activity by blocking the interaction of two of its subunits (R. Cencic et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 108:1046-1051, 2011). Herein we describe a molecule from this screen that prevents the interaction between eIF4E (the cap-binding protein) and eIF4G (a large scaffolding protein), inhibiting cap-dependent translation. This inhibitor significantly decreased human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) replication, reducing the percentage of infected cells and intra- and extracellular infectious virus titers.

METHODS Fellows participated in a 2-day course consisting of case presentations, expert panels, and hands-on laboratory training. Before and after the course, fellows completed a questionnaire assessing demographics, experiences in residency, practice plans, plans to implement flexible endoscopy in practice, and level of confidence performing 15 endoscopic procedures. Half of the fellows were randomly assigned to complete pre- and post-skills testing using a previously validated endoscopic targeting model. RESULTS Fifty-four fellows (90 %; age 33.5 ± 2.8; 58 % male) completed the pre- and post-questionnaire. All MIS fellowship types were represented. Almost half (48 %) reported none or very little flexible endoscopy in their current fellowship. The average prior case volume among those completing an ACGME-approved residency (42/54) was 76 upper and 75 lower endoscopies with one-third reporting no experience in therapeutic EGD (33 %) or polypectomy (31 %). Intentions to implement flexible endoscopy in practice significantly improved after the course overall (3.72 ± .85-3.92 ± .69, p < 0.05; 1 = never; 5 = very frequently). Prior to the course, 39 % of fellows reported plans to use endoscopy in practice ""occasionally"" or ""rarely."" After, this decreased to 28 with 72 % planning to implement ""frequently"" or ""very frequently."" Mean levels of confidence performing all 15 endoscopic tasks improved significantly after the course.

However, production and utilization modes of IMP1 using Lactococcus lactis as delivery vector were not reported untill now. In the present study, Eimeria tenella IMP1 (EtIMP1) protein was expressed in L. lactis under the nisin-inducible promoter, and EtIMP1 protein was produced in cytoplasmic, cell wall-anchored and secreted forms. Each chicken was orally immunized with one of the three live EtIMP1-expressing lactococci three times at 2 weeks intervals (immunized group), or with live bacteria harboring empty vector (immunized control group). Chickens in immunized and immunized control group were challenged with E. tenella sporulated oocysts to assess the immune responses.

The 45S and 5S rRNA genes are independent and localized at one or more loci per the chromosome complement, their positions along chromosomes offer useful markers for chromosome discriminations. In the current study FISH has been performed to locate 45S and 5S rRNA genes on the chromosomes of nine Lathyrus species belong to five different sections, all have chromosome number 2n=14, Lathyrus gorgoni Parl, Lathyrus hirsutus L., Lathyrus amphicarpos L., Lathyrus odoratus L., Lathyrus sphaericus Retz, Lathyrus incospicuus L, Lathyrus paranensis Burkart, Lathyrus nissolia L., and Lathyrus articulates L. RESULTS The revealed loci of 45S and 5S rDNA by FISH on metaphase chromosomes of the examined species were as follow: all of the studied species have one 45S rDNA locus and one 5S rDNA locus except L. odoratus L., L. amphicarpos L. and L. sphaericus Retz L. have two loci of 5S rDNA. Three out of the nine examined species have the loci of 45S and 5S rRNA genes on the opposite arms of the same chromosome (L. nissolia L., L. amphicarpos L., and L. incospicuus L.), while L. hirsutus L. has both loci on the same chromosome arm. The other five species showed the loci of the two types of rDNA on different chromosomes. CONCLUSION The detected 5S and 45S rDNA loci in Lathyrus could be used as chromosomal markers to discriminate the chromosome pairs of the examined species. FISH could discriminate only one chromosome pair out of the seven pairs in three species, in L. hirsutus L., L. nissolia L. and L. incospicuus L., and two chromosome pairs in five species, in L. paranensis Burkart, L. odoratus L., L. amphicarpos L., L. gorgoni Parl. and L. articulatus L., while it could discriminate three chromosome pairs in L. sphaericus Retz. these results could contribute into the physical genome mapping of Lathyrus species and the evolution of rDNA patterns by FISH in the coming studies in future.","Ali, Hoda B M; Osman, Samira A","Journal, genetic engineering & biotechnology",3,5

OBJECTIVE To identify unobserved distinctive patterns of congruence trajectories and examine how the typology of outcome development differed between ACP and controls. METHODS Multisite, assessor-blinded, intent-to-treat, randomized clinical trial enrolled participants between October 2013 to March 2017 from 5 hospital-based HIV clinics. Persons living with HIV(PLWH)/surrogate dyads were randomized to 2 weekly 60-minute sessions: ACP (1) ACP facilitated conversation, (2) advance directive completion; or Control (1) Developmental/relationship history, (2) Nutrition/Exercise. Growth Mixed Modeling was used for 18-month post-intervention analysis. FINDINGS 223 dyads (N = 449 participants) were enrolled. PLWH were 56% male, aged 22 to 77 years, and 86% African American. Surrogates were 56% female, aged 18 to 82 years, and 84% African American. Two latent classes (High vs. Low) of congruence growth trajectory were identified. ACP influenced the trajectory of outcome growth (congruence in all 5 AIDS related situations) by latent class. ACP dyads had a significantly higher probability of being in the High Congruence latent class compared to controls (52%, 75/144 dyads versus 27%, 17/62 dyads, p = 0.001). The probabilities of perfect congruence diminished at 3-months post-intervention but was then sustained. ACP had a significant effect (β = 1.92, p = 0.006, OR = 7.10, 95%C.I.: 1.729, 26.897) on the odds of being in the High Congruence class. CONCLUSION ACP had a significant effect on the trajectory of congruence growth over time. ACP dyads had 7 times the odds of congruence, compared to controls. Three-months post-intervention is optimal for booster sessions.","Lyon, Maureen E; Caceres, Sarah; Scott, Rachel K; Benator, Debra; Briggs, Linda; Greenberg, Isabella; D'Angelo, Lawrence J; Cheng, Yao I; Wang, Jichuan",The American journal of hospice & palliative care,3,27

This systematic review has two aims: to define the relationship between kinesiophobia and functional outcomes, pain and range of motion following TKR, and to evaluate published treatments for kinesiophobia following TKR. MATERIALS AND METHODS A primary search of electronic databases, grey literature, and trial registries was performed in March 2020. English-language studies recruiting adult primary TKR patients, using the Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia (TSK) were included. Outcome measures were grouped into short (< 6 months), medium (6-12 months), and long term (> 12 months). Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale for cohort or case control studies, and the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias tool for randomised controlled trials. RESULTS All thirteen included papers (82 identified) showed adequately low risk of methodological bias. TSK1 (activity avoidance) correlated with WOMAC functional score at 12 months in three studies (r = 0.20 p < 0.05, R = 0.317 p = 0.001, and correlation coefficient 0.197 p = 0.005). TSK score significantly correlated with mean active range of motion (ROM) at 2 weeks [65.98 (SD = 14.51) versus 47.35 (SD = 14.48) p = 0.000], 4 weeks [88.20 (SD = 15.11) versus 57.65 (SD = 14.80) p = 0.000], and 6 months [105.33 (SD = 12.34) versus 85.53 (SD = 14.77) p = 0.000] post-operation. Three post-operative interventions improved TSK score vs control following TKR: a home-based functional exercise programme [TSK - 14.30 (SD = 0.80) versus - 2.10 (SD = 0.80) p < 0.001], an outpatient cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) programme [TSK 27.76 (SD = 4.56) versus 36.54 (SD = 3.58)], and video-based psychological treatment [TSK 24 (SD = 5) versus 29 (SD = 5) p < 0.01]. CONCLUSIONS Kinesiophobia negatively affects functional outcomes up until 1 year post-operatively, while active ROM is reduced up to 6 months post-procedure. Post-operative functional and psychological interventions can improve kinesiophobia following TKR.","Brown, Oliver S; Hu, L; Demetriou, C; Smith, T O; Hing, C B",Archives of orthopaedic and trauma surgery,3,7

Social distancing policies have resulted in the rapid adoption of virtual learning (VL) by neurosurgeons as a method to exchange knowledge, but it has been met with variable acceptance. The authors surveyed neurosurgeons from around the world regarding their opinions about VL and how they see the future of neurosurgical conferences. METHODS The authors conducted a global online survey assessing the experience of neurosurgeons and trainees with VL activities. They also questioned respondents about how they see the future of on-site conferences and scientific meetings. They analyzed responses against demographic data, regions in which the respondents practice, and socioeconomic factors by using frequency histograms and multivariate logistic regression models. RESULTS Eight hundred ninety-one responses from 96 countries were received. There has been an increase in VL activities since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Most respondents perceive this type of learning as positive. Respondents from lower-income nations and regions such as Europe and Central Asia were more receptive to these changes and wanted to see further movement of educational activities (conferences and scientific meetings) into a VL format. The latter desire may be driven by financial savings from not traveling. Most queried neurosurgeons indicated that virtual events are likely to partially replace on-site events. CONCLUSIONS The pandemic has improved perceptions of VL, and despite its limitations, VL has been well received by the majority of neurosurgeons. Lower-income nations in particular are embracing this technology. VL is still evolving, but its integration with traditional in-person meetings seems inevitable.","El-Ghandour, Nasser M F; Ezzat, Ahmed A M; Zaazoue, Mohamed A; Gonzalez-Lopez, Pablo; Jhawar, Balraj S; Soliman, Mohamed A R",Neurosurgical focus,3,0

Ethyl pyruvate (EP), an off-the-shelf agent, appears to be a redox analog of DMF, but its immunomodulatory properties have not been put into the context of MS therapy. In this article, we examined and compared the effects of EP and DMF on MS-relevant activity/functions of T cells, macrophages, microglia, and astrocytes. EP efficiently suppressed the release of MS signature cytokines, IFN-γ and IL-17, from human PBMCs. Furthermore, the production of these cytokines was notably decreased in encephalitogenic T cells after in vivo application of EP to rats. Production of two other proinflammatory cytokines, IL-6 and TNF, and NO was suppressed by EP in macrophages and microglia. Reactive oxygen species production in macrophages, microglia activation, and the development of Ag-presenting phenotype in microglia and macrophages were constrained by EP. The release of IL-6 was reduced in astrocytes. Finally, EP inhibited the activation of transcription factor NF-κB in microglia and astrocytes. Most of these effects were also found for DMF, implying that EP and DMF share common targets and mechanisms of action. Importantly, EP had in vivo impact on experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, an animal model of MS. Treatment with EP resulted in delay and shortening of the first relapse, and lower clinical scores, whereas the second attack was annihilated. Further studies on the possibility to use EP as an MS therapeutic are warranted.","Miljković, Djordje; Blaževski, Jana; Petković, Filip; Djedović, Neda; Momčilović, Miljana; Stanisavljević, Suzana; Jevtić, Bojan; Mostarica Stojković, Marija; Spasojević, Ivan",Journal of immunology,3,12

The purpose of this multicenter study was to evaluate whether preimplantation device simulation with the Sim&Size software results in selection of different device dimensions than manual sizing. MATERIALS AND METHODS In a multicenter cohort of 74 patients undergoing aneurysm treatment with the Pipeline Embolization Device, we compared apparent optimal device dimensions determined by neurointerventionalists with considerable Pipeline Embolization Device experience based on manual 2D measurements taken from rotational angiography with computed optimal dimensions determined by Sim&Size experts blinded to the neurointerventionalists' decision. Agreement between manually determined and computed optimal dimensions was evaluated with the Cohen κ. The significance of the difference was analyzed with the Wilcoxon signed rank test. RESULTS The agreement index between manual selection and computed optimal dimensions was low (κ for diameter = 0.219; κ for length = 0.149, P < .01). Computed optimal device lengths were significantly shorter (median, 14 versus 16 mm, T = 402, r = -0.28, P < .01). No significant difference was observed for device diameters. CONCLUSIONS Low agreement between manually determined and computed optimal device dimensions is not proof, per se, that virtual simulation performs better than manual selection. Nevertheless, it ultimately reflects the potential for optimization of the device-sizing process, and use of the Sim&Size software reduces, in particular, device length. Nevertheless, further evaluation is required to clarify the impact of device-dimension modifications on outcome.","Ospel, J M; Gascou, G; Costalat, V; Piergallini, L; Blackham, K A; Zumofen, D W",AJNR.

DESIGN A retrospective review of data collected in an institutional registry. SETTING An academic hospital. PARTICIPANTS One hundred twenty-five consecutive patients with severe aortic stenosis who underwent transfemoral TAVI. INTERVENTIONS GA versus LRA followed by postoperative care. Complications were defined by pre-established criteria. MATERIAL AND METHODS Consecutive patients referred for transfemoral TAVI between October 2006 and October 2010 initially underwent GA (n = 91) followed by LRA after March 2010 (n= 34). Results are presented as mean ± standard deviation or median (25-75 percentiles) as appropriate. GA and LRA TAVI patients had similar preoperative characteristics. LRA was associated with a significantly shorter procedure duration (LRA: 80 [67-102]; GA: 120 [90-140 minutes]; p < 0.001), hospital stay (LRA: 8.5 [7-14.5]; GA: 15.5 [10-24] days; p < 0.001), intraoperative requirements of catecholamines (LRA 23%; GA: 90% of patients; p < 0.001), and volume expansion (LRA: 11 [8-16]; GA: 22 [15-36] mL/kg; p < 0.001). There were significant differences in delta creatinine (day 1, preoperative creatinine values; LRA: 0 [-12 to 9]; GA: -15 (-25 to 2.9) μmol, p < 0.004). The frequency of any postoperative complications was 38% (LRA) and 77% (GA) (p = 0.11). Thirty-day mortality was 7% (GA) and 9% (LRA) (p = 0.9). CONCLUSIONS This observational study suggests that LRA was associated with less intraoperative hemodynamic instability and significant shortening of the procedure and hospital stay. Changes in the anesthetic technique adapted to changes in TAVI interventional techniques and did not increase the rate of postoperative complications.","Dehédin, Bénédicte; Guinot, Pierre-Grégoire; Ibrahim, Hassan; Allou, Nicolas; Provenchère, Sophie; Dilly, Marie-Pierre; Vahanian, Alec; Himbert, Dominique; Brochet, Eric; Radu, Costin; Nataf, Patrick; Montravers, Philippe; Longrois, Dan; Depoix, Jean-Pol",Journal of cardiothoracic and vascular anesthesia,3,1

METHODS Eighty-one HCC patients who underwent repeat hepatectomy in our hospital from 2008 to 2019 were retrospectively analyzed in this study. Of these patients, 30 and 51 patients underwent LRH and ORH, respectively. We analyzed surgical outcomes of LRH and ORH, focusing on tumor characteristics such as tumor size, location, distance from major vessels, and contralateral or ipsilateral tumor recurrence to determine what factors could affect surgical outcomes. Subsequently, using a propensity-matched cohort, we compared the impact of those factors on LRH and ORH outcomes. RESULTS In the entire cohort, the LRH operation time was significantly shorter in contralateral recurrent HCC cases than in ipsilateral recurrent HCC cases (252 vs. 398 min, P = 0.008); however, such a difference was not observed in the ORH operation time. We subsequently compared the surgical outcomes, in terms of the location of tumor recurrence, between the LRH and ORH groups in a propensity-matched cohort. In total, 23 patients were included in each of these groups. We found that the LRH procedure had significantly shorter operative time than the ORH procedure in the contralateral recurrent HCC cases (253 vs. 391 min, P = 0.018); however, we did not observe such a difference in the ipsilateral recurrent HCC cases (372 vs. 333 min, P = 0.669). LRH had lower blood loss, similar postoperative complications and shorter hospital stay than ORH in both contralateral and ipsilateral recurrent HCC cases.

Although sit-ups are simple to perform, the perceived high effort is the reason why training the abdominal muscles is seldom continued over a longer period of time. It is well known that the abdominal muscles are inferior to the back muscles in terms of force, but this cannot explain the extreme difference in perceived effort between trunk flexion and extension tasks. Therefore, this study was aimed at the identification of control strategy influences on the muscular stress level. Thirty-nine subjects were investigated. The performed tasks were restricted to the sagittal plane and were implemented with simulated and realized tilt angles. Subjects were investigated in an upright position with their lower bodies fixed and their upper bodies free. Posture-controlled tasks involved graded forward and backward tilting, while force-controlled tasks involved the application of force based on a virtual tilt angle. The Surface EMG (SEMG) was taken from five trunk muscles on both sides. Control strategies seemed to have no systematic influence on the SEMG amplitudes of the back muscles. In contrast, the abdominal muscles exhibited significantly higher stress levels under posture-controlled conditions without relevantly increasing antagonistic co-activation of back muscles. The abdominal muscles' relative differences ranged from an average of 20% for the external oblique abdominal muscle to approximately 40% for the rectus abdominal muscle. The perceived high effort expended during sit-ups can now be explained by the posture-controlled contractions that are required.","Hansen, Laura; Anders, Christoph",Physiological reports,3,1

Chronic ambulatory care sensitive conditions refer to chronic diseases that can be managed in primary care settings, including angina, asthma, and diabetes, with hospitalizations for these conditions considered potentially avoidable with adequate primary care interventions. Socioeconomic inequities in the risk of hospitalization have been observed in several health systems globally. While there are multiple studies examining the association between socioeconomic status and hospitalizations for chronic ambulatory care sensitive conditions, these studies have not been systematically reviewed. The objective of this study is to systematically identify and describe socioeconomic inequalities in hospitalizations for chronic ambulatory care sensitive conditions amongst adult populations in economically developed countries reported in high-quality observational studies published in the peer-reviewed literature. METHODS Peer-reviewed literature was searched in six health and social science databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycInfo, CINAHL, ASSIA, and IBSS using search terms for hospitalization, socioeconomic status, and chronic ambulatory care sensitive conditions. Study titles and abstracts were first screened followed by full-text review according to the following eligibility criteria: 1) Study outcome is hospitalization for selected chronic ambulatory care sensitive conditions; 2) Primary exposure is individual- or area-level socioeconomic status; 3) Study population has a mean age ± 1 SD < 75 years of age; 4) Study setting is economically developed countries; and 5) Study type is observational. Relevant data was then extracted, and studies were critically appraised using appropriate tools from The Joanna Briggs Institute. Results were narratively synthesized according to socioeconomic constructs and type of adjustment (minimally versus fully adjusted). RESULTS Of the 15,857 unique peer-reviewed studies identified, 31 studies met the eligibility criteria and were of sufficient quality for inclusion. Socioeconomic constructs and hospitalization outcomes varied across studies. However, despite this heterogeneity, a robust and consistent association between lower levels of socioeconomic status and higher risk of hospitalizations for chronic ambulatory care sensitive conditions was observed. CONCLUSIONS This systematic review is the first to comprehensively identify and analyze literature on the relationship between SES and hospitalizations for chronic ambulatory care sensitive conditions, considering both aggregate and condition-specific outcomes that are common to several international health systems. The evidence consistently demonstrates that lower socioeconomic status is a risk factor for hospitalization across global settings. Effective health and social interventions are needed to reduce these inequities and ensure fair and adequate care across socioeconomic groups.

Inhalation anesthetics are cerebral vasodilators. In <1 MAC values, the net effect is a moderate decrease in cerebral blood flow and maintenance of responsiveness to carbon dioxide. This study aims to investigate the effects of steady-state sevoflurane anesthesia on hemodynamic and cerebral artery diameter measurements in patients undergoing flow diverter device placement under general anesthesia. METHODS Forty-six patients aged 18-70 years who underwent flow diverter devices under general anesthesia were included in this study. Routine monitoring was performed on the patients. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) values were recorded. Internal carotid artery, middle cerebral artery and anterior cerebral artery diameter measurements were made from digital subtraction angiography (DSA) images of patients with anterior aneurysms. Baseline artery, right posterior cerebral artery and left posterior cerebral artery diameter measurements were made from DSA images of patients with posterior aneurysms. These measurements were recorded as preoperative measurements. The same measurements were made from the DSA images performed before the Flow diverter device placement procedure performed under steady-state sevoflurane anesthesia for the same patients. These measurements were recorded as peroperative measurements. RESULTS The average age of the patients was 56.6±15.1. The MAP of the patients before induction was 76.28±5.13 mmHg, MAP after induction was 64.36±3.23 mmHg, and MAP during sevoflurane anesthesia was 68.26±4.30 mmHg, there was a statistically significant difference. There was a statistically significant difference between the preoperative and perioperative values of anterior cerebral artery diameters. There was a strong relationship between the MAP change percentage and the ICA diameter change percentage (p<0.001, p=-0.785) and a moderate relationship between the MCA diameter change percentage (p=0.033, p=-0.338). CONCLUSION In patients undergoing flow diverter devices, <1 MAC sevoflurane has a hemodynamic effect and creates significant vasodilation in the cerebral artery diameters.","Arıcan, Şule; Bakdık, Süleyman; Hacıbeyoğlu, Gülçin; Yılmaz, Resul; Koç, Osman; Tavlan, Aybars; Tuncer Uzun, Sema",Ulusal travma ve acil cerrahi dergisi = Turkish journal of trauma & emergency surgery : TJTES,3,1

After progression of disease evaluated based on RECIST 1.1, toripalimab and SOX regimen was administered because of PD-L1-positive expression, high tumor mutation burden (TMB), and somatic FANCA deletion in the tumor. Both the primary and metastatic tumor mass shrank significantly after two courses. The patient exhibited sustained partial response for at least six courses with well-controlled toxic effects. Then the treatment had to be stopped for 2 months because of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Computed tomography scan in March 2020 showed disease progression.

The purpose of this investigation was to describe normal VFSS findings status post-successful EZD. METHODS The charts of all patients with ZD treated at our center between October 01, 2011, and May 30, 2014, were abstracted. Outcome measures included recidivistic diverticulum size, Eating Assessment Tool-10 (EAT-10), penetration aspiration scale, pharyngeal constriction ratio (PCR), and pharyngoesophageal segment (PES) opening. RESULTS Twenty patients met inclusion criteria. The mean age was 70.5 (± 13) years. Seventy percent of the patients were male. Mean EAT-10 decreased 72.1% from 17.9 (± 8.2) to 5 (± 6.9) (P < 0.0001), and diverticulum size decreased 50.9% from 1.96 cm (± 0.68) to 0.96 cm (± 0.57) (P < 0.001). The PCR improved 33.6% from 0.17 (± 0.13) to 0.11 (± 0.11) (P < 0.001). Mean PES opening increased 61.6% from 0.53 cm (± 0.3544) to 0.86 cm (± 0.29) in lateral view and increased 40.0% from 1.00 cm (± 0.54) to 1.39 cm (± 0.46) in anteroposterior view (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION VFSS following successful EZD demonstrates an approximate 50% reduction in diverticulum size and significant improvement in PCR and PES opening. These data provide a framework for the expected fluoroscopic outcomes of successful diverticulotomy. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE 4.

Most centers apply recanalization therapies for BAO up to 12-24 hours after symptom onset, which is a substantially longer time window than the 4.5 hours used in anterior circulation stroke. In this speculative synthesis, we discuss recent advances in BAO treatment in order to understand why and under which circumstances longer symptom duration might not necrotize the brainstem and turn therapeutic attempts futile. We raise the possibility that distinct features of the posterior circulation, e.g., highly developed, persistent collateral arterial network, reverse filling of the distal basilar artery, and delicate plasma flow siding the clot, might sustain brittle patency of brainstem perforators in the face of stepwise growth of the thrombus. Meanwhile, the tissue clock characterizing the rapid necrosis of a typical anterior circulation penumbra will not start. During this perilous time period, recanalization at any point would salvage the brainstem from eventual necrosis caused by imminent reinforcement and further building up of the clot.","Lindsberg, Perttu J; Pekkola, Johanna; Strbian, Daniel; Sairanen, Tiina; Mattle, Heinrich P; Schroth, Gerhard",Neurology,3,30

This barrier in scientific knowledge and data transfer likely leads to significant knowledge gaps and may create biases when providing global patterns in many fields of science. To demonstrate this, we compiled data on the global economic costs of invasive alien species reported in 15 non-English languages. We compared it with equivalent data from English documents (i.e., the InvaCost database, the most up-to-date repository of invasion costs globally). The comparison of both databases (~7500 entries in total) revealed that non-English sources: (i) capture a greater amount of data than English sources alone (2500 vs. 2396 cost entries respectively); (ii) add 249 invasive species and 15 countries to those reported by English literature, and (iii) increase the global cost estimate of invasions by 16.6% (i.e., US$ 214 billion added to 1.288 trillion estimated from the English database). Additionally, 2712 cost entries - not directly comparable to the English database - were directly obtained from practitioners, revealing the value of communication between scientists and practitioners. Moreover, we demonstrated how gaps caused by overlooking non-English data resulted in significant biases in the distribution of costs across space, taxonomic groups, types of cost, and impacted sectors. Specifically, costs from Europe, at the local scale, and particularly pertaining to management, were largely under-represented in the English database. Thus, combining scientific data from English and non-English sources proves fundamental and enhances data completeness. Considering non-English sources helps alleviate biases in understanding invasion costs at a global scale. Finally, it also holds strong potential for improving management performance, coordination among experts (scientists and practitioners), and collaborative actions across countries.

All three of the Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines (9-valent, quadrivalent and bivalent HPV vaccine) provide primary protection against the most common cancer-causing strains of HPV (types 16 and 18) that are known to cause 70% of cervical cancers. Over the last five years, there has been an increase in Sub-Saharan African countries that have introduced the HPV vaccine. The majority of research has been conducted on supply-side barriers and facilitators to HPV vaccination uptake in SSA, yet little research has been conducted on demand-side or end-user perspectives of, and decisions around, HPV vaccination. In order to complement existing research, and inform current and future HPV vaccination implementation approaches, this qualitative systematic review explored Stakeholders' understandings of HPV vaccination in SSA. This review searched the following databases: Embase (via Scopus), Scopus, MEDLINE (via PubMed), PubMed, EBSCOhost, Academic Search Premier, Africa-Wide Information, CINAHL, PsycARTICLES, PsycINFO, SocINDEX, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Controlled Register of Trials (CENTRAL) and found a total of 259 articles. Thirty-one studies were found eligible for inclusion and were analyzed thematically using Braun and Clarke's methods for conducting a thematic analysis. The quality of included studies was assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) checklist.

There is a need to broaden the focus on living well with kidney disease and re-engagement in life, including an emphasis on patients being in control. The World Kidney Day (WKD) Joint Steering Committee has declared 2021 the year of ""Living Well with Kidney Disease"" in an effort to increase education and awareness on the important goal of patient empowerment and life participation. This calls for the development and implementation of validated patient-reported outcome measures to assess and address areas of life participation in routine care. It could be supported by regulatory agencies as a metric for quality care or to support labelling claims for medicines and devices. Funding agencies could establish targeted calls for research that address the priorities of patients. Patients with kidney disease and their care-partners should feel supported to live well through concerted efforts by kidney care communities, including during pandemics. In the overall wellness program for kidney disease patients, the need for prevention should be reiterated. Early detection with a prolonged course of wellness despite kidney disease, after effective secondary and tertiary prevention programs, should be promoted.

Current guidelines recommend suboccipital decompressive craniectomy (SDC) with dural expansion when medical therapy is not sufficient. However, there is no good-quality evidence to support this surgical practice, and both surgical timing and technique remain controverted. In this study, we describe an alternative to SDC, namely surgical evacuation of infarcted tissue (necrosectomy) and its clinical outcomes. METHODS - In this retrospective, single-center study, 34 consecutive patients with SOCS undergoing necrosectomy via osteoplastic craniotomy were included. Patient characteristics and radiological findings were evaluated. In order to differentiate the effects of age on the functional outcome, patients were divided into two groups (group I: age ≤60; group II: age >60). Functional outcome was assessed using the Glasgow outcome scale (GOS), modified Rankin scale (mRS) and Barthel index (BI) at the time of discharge and 30 days postoperatively. RESULTS - In our cohort, we observed a 21% overall mortality, while 76% of patients reached good functional outcome (GOS≥4). No statistically significant differences in mortality or functional outcome were observed between both patient groups. Comparing our data to a recent meta-analysis on SDC, the number of adverse events and unfavorable outcome showed equipoise between both treatment modalities. CONCLUSIONS - Necrosectomy appears to be a suitable alternative to SDC in SOCS, achieving comparable mortality and functional outcomes. Further trials are necessary to evaluate which surgical technique is more beneficial in the setting of SOCS.","Hernández-Durán, Silvia; Wolfert, Christina; Rohde, Veit; Mielke, Dorothee",World neurosurgery,3,31

Apart from the oxygen therapy and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, Remdesivir and Dexamethasone have been proven to be efficacious against COVID-19, along with various vaccine candidates and monoclonal antibody cocktail therapy for Regeneron. All of these are currently at different stages of clinical trials. People with weak immunity are more prone to a severe infection of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, early and judicious nutritional supplementation along with pharmacological treatment and clinician collaborations are critical in restituting the current situation. Nutritional supplements help in acquiring strong immunity to prevent the progression of disease any further. Vitamin C, vitamin D, selenium, zinc and many other nutritional and dietary supplements inhibit the production of inflammatory cytokines during a viral infection and prevents several unwanted symptoms of infection. Many dietary components like citrus fruits, black elderberry, ginger, and probiotics have the ability to attack viral replication. These supplements can also tame the overriding immune system during coronavirus infection. Keeping in view these facts, nutritional and dietary supplements can be used along with other management modalities. These nutritional and dietary supplements are potential candidates to curb the convulsive unfolding of novel COVID-19, in combination with other standard treatment protocols. In this review, various search engines were used to exploit available literature in order to provide a comprehensive review on nutritional and dietary supplements with respect to the viral infections. It will also provide a brief overview on some of the clinical trials that are in progress to assess the role of nutritional supplements, either alone or in combination with other pharmacological drugs, in fight against COVID-19.","Yaseen, Muhammad Osama; Jamshaid, Humzah; Saif, Arifa; Hussain, Talib",International journal for vitamin and nutrition research.

METHODS A retrospective study analyzed 149 consecutively performed temporary-to-long-term tunneled central venous catheter conversions in the operating room (OR) from a dialysis facility from March 2014 to September 2017. The data collected consisted of the total procedures performed, demographic characteristics of the study population, rates of success, aborted procedure, failure, complications, and catheter survival, and costs. RESULTS the main causes of end stage renal disease (ESRD) were systemic arterial hypertension and diabetes mellitus, 37.9% each. Patients had a high number of previous arteriovenous fistula (1.72 ± 0.84) and temporary catheter (2.87 ± 1.9) attempts until a definitive vascular access was achieved, while the preferred vascular site was right internal jugular vein (80%). Success, abortion, and failure rates were 93.3%, 2.7% and 4%, respectively, with only 5.36% of complications (minors). Overall LTCVC survival rates over 1, 3, 6, and 12 months were 93.38, 71.81, 54.36, and 30.2%, respectively, with a mean of 298 ± 280 days (median 198 days). The procedure cost was around 496 dollars.

We aim to describe the perception of telemedicine by both surgical patients and providers to understand the preferences for future incorporation in future surgical practice. METHODS An anonymous survey was administered to providers that transitioned clinic visits to telemedicine encounters since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the second part of the study, patients who underwent video telemedicine appointments answered survey questions via telephone. RESULTS Twenty-six out of 36 (72.7%) providers responded. Over 75% reported that they could effectively communicate with patients over telemedicine. Six (23.1%) reported that they could adequately assess surgical sites. Of 361 patients, 187 consented to the study (consent rate 51.8%). Among patients, the most common result to choose a telemedicine appointment was to avoid the risk of COVID-19 transmission (84, 44.9%), though the minority reported that they would choose telemedicine after the pandemic (64, 34.2%). Those patients who would choose an in-person visit were more likely to have a higher Charlson Comorbidity Score, body mass index, and use friends or family for transportation. In open-ended feedback, patients suggested that telemedicine would be better suited for long-term follow-up rather than the immediate postoperative setting. CONCLUSIONS Patients and providers reported a high degree of satisfaction using telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic but noted concern with limited physical examinations. Telemedicine may be suited for preoperative evaluation and medium-term and long-term postoperative follow-up for surgical patients.","Zhu, Clara; Williamson, John; Lin, Andrew; Bush, Kathryn; Hakim, Abraham; Upadhyaya, Kirtan; Hunter, Krystal; Sensenig, Richard; Spitz, Francis; Atabek, Umur; Hong, Young Ki",The American surgeon,3,12

This proportion will increase significantly over the next 20 years, but it is unlikely that resources for intensive care increase correspondingly. Thus, it is important to establish which patients among elderly that benefits from intensive care. The main objective of the study was to investigate the relationships between geriatric scoring tools and 30-day mortality. METHODS The study included 451 Norwegian patients ≥80 years who were included in two prospective European observation studies (VIP (Very old Intensive care Patient)1 of VIP2). Both studies included Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) while VIP2 also obtained the geriatric scores Comorbidity and polypharmacy score (CPS), Short form of Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE) and Katz Activity of Daily Living score (Katz ADL). RESULTS Survival after 30 days was 59.9%. Risk factors for 30-day mortality were increasing Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (Odds Ratio (OR) 1.30; Confidence Interval (CI) 95% 1.22-1.39) and (CFS) > 3 (CFS 4: OR 1.96 (CI 95% 1.01-3.81); CFS 5-9: OR 1.81 (CI) 95% 1.12-2.93)). Data from VIP2 showed that CFS was the only independent predictor of 30-day mortality when these scores were tested in multivariate analyzes separately together with age, SOFA and gender (OR 1.21 (95% CI 1.03-1.41)). CONCLUSIONS Elderly intensive care patients had a 30-day survival rate of 59.9%. Factors strongly associated with 30-day mortality were increasing SOFA score and increasing frailty (CFS).

It is argued that social presence remains less understood despite being one of the essential elements. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to understand how facilitators and participants engage with and use a social presence in an online seminar. It is concluded that when facilitators include the use of a social presence in the design of the online learning space in-depth engagement with online content also increases. This can happen rapidly (less than an hour) and continue for several weeks. It is deduced that a social presence enhances a sense of realness among participants of online learning and through an increased sense realness engagement increases.","Waddington, Andrew; Porter, Shannon",Nurse education in practice,3,31

However, they have also brought to light organ-specific complications, especially pulmonary complications. In this setting, pulmonary complications are consistently associated with poor outcomes, and improved management of these complications is required. Areas covered: We review the multiple infectious and noninfectious lung complications that occur both early and late after allogeneic HSCT. This includes the description of these complications, risk factors, diagnostic approach and outcome. A literature search was performed using PubMed-indexed journals. Expert commentary: Multiple lung complications after allogeneic HSCT can be diagnosed concomitantly and require a multidisciplinary approach. A specific clinical evaluation including a precise analysis of a lung CT scan is necessary. Management of these lung complications, especially the noninfectious ones, is impaired by the lack of prospective, randomized control trials, suggesting preventive strategies should be developed.","Bondeelle, Louise; Bergeron, Anne",Expert review of respiratory medicine,3,1

This systematic literature review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the impact of ≥3 months of exposure to anticholinergics as a class on the risk of dementia, mild cognitive impairment, and change in cognitive function. The impact of anticholinergic agents specifically used to treat overactive bladder was also evaluated. MATERIALS AND METHODS A systematic literature review was conducted to identify English language articles evaluating the impact of anticholinergic use for ≥3 months on dementia or cognitive function in adult patients. Databases searched included PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library. Meta-analyses were conducted using random-effects models; 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and 95% prediction intervals (PIs) were reported. RESULTS A total of 2122 records were identified. Out of those, 21 studies underwent qualitative synthesis and 6 reported endpoints relevant for inclusion in a meta-analysis assessing the risk of incident dementia. The overall rate ratio for incident dementia was 1.46 (95% CI: 1.17-1.81; 95% PI: 0.70-3.04; n = 6). The risk of incident dementia increased with increasing exposure (n = 3). In addition, two studies from the meta-analysis reported an increased risk of dementia with ≥3 months of use of bladder antimuscarinics (adjusted odds ratios ranged from 1.21 to 1.65, depending on exposure category). CONCLUSION Anticholinergic use for ≥3 months increased the risk of dementia on average by an estimated 46% versus nonuse. This relationship was consistent in studies assessing overactive bladder medications. The risk of developing dementia should be carefully considered in the context of potential benefit before prescribing anticholinergics.","Dmochowski, Roger R; Thai, Sydney; Iglay, Kristy; Enemchukwu, Ekene; Tee, Silvia; Varano, Susann; Girman, Cynthia; Radican, Larry; Mudd, Paul N; Poole, Charles",Neurourology and urodynamics,3,1

Various methods for detecting HMPV have been developed and applied in clinical laboratories. When reviewing the literature, we found that polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assays have been most frequently and consistently used to detect HMPV. The most commonly used method was multiplex reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR; 57.4%), followed by real-time RT-PCR (38.3%). Multiplex RT-PCR became the more popular method in 2011-2019 (69.7%), in contrast to 2001-2009 (28.6%). The advent of multiplex PCR in detecting broader viral pathogens in one run and coinfected viruses influenced the change in user preference. Further, newly developed microarray technologies and ionization mass spectrometry were introduced in 2011-2019. Viral culture (including shell vial assays) and fluorescent immunoassays (with or without culture) were once the mainstays. However, the percentage of studies employing culture and fluorescent immunoassays decreased from 21.4% in 2001-2010 to 15.2% in 2011-2019. Meanwhile, the use of PCR-based methods of HMPV detection increased from 78.6% in 2001-2010 to 84.8% in 2011-2019. The increase in PCR-based methods might have occurred because PCR methods demonstrated better diagnostic performance, shorter hands-on and run times, less hazards to laboratory personnel, and more reliable results than traditional methods. When using these assays, it is important to acquire a comprehensive understanding of the principles, advantages, disadvantages, and precautions for data interpretation. In the future, the combination of nanotechnology and advanced genetic platforms such as next-generation sequencing will benefit patients with HMPV infection by facilitating efficient therapeutic intervention. Analytical and clinical validation are required before using new techniques in clinical laboratories.","Jeong, Seri; Park, Min-Jeong; Song, Wonkeun; Kim, Hyon-Suk",Annals of translational medicine,3,27

Data obtained at our center for an earlier multinational multicenter trial regarding an in-house developed simulation software were re-evaluated in order to analyze whether the software was able to predict local recurrences. METHODS Twenty-seven RFA ablations for either primary or secondary hepatic tumors were included. Colorectal liver metastases were shown in 14 patients and hepatocellular carcinoma in 13 patients. Overlap of the simulated volume and the tumor volume was automatically generated and defined as positive predictive value (PPV) and additionally visually assessed. Local recurrence during follow-up was defined as gold standard. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated using the visual assessment and gold standard. RESULTS Mean tumor size was 18 mm (95% CI 15-21 mm). Local recurrence occurred in 5 patients. The PPV of the simulation showed a mean of 0.89 (0.84-0.93 95% CI). After visual assessment, 9 incomplete ablations were observed, of which 4 true positives and 5 false positives for the detection of an incomplete ablation. The sensitivity and specificity were, respectively, 80% and 77% with a correct prediction in 78% of cases. No significant correlation was found between size of the tumor and PPV (Pearson Correlation 0.10; p = 0.62) or between PPV and recurrence rates (Pearson Correlation 0.28; p = 0.16). CONCLUSIONS The simulation software shows promise in estimating the completeness of liver RFA treatment and predicting local recurrence rates, but could not be performed real-time. Future improvements in the field of registration could improve results and provide a possibility for real-time implementation.","van Amerongen, M J; Mariappan, P; Voglreiter, P; Flanagan, R; Jenniskens, S F M; Pollari, M; Kolesnik, M; Moche, M; Fütterer, J J",International journal of computer assisted radiology and surgery,3,16

However, there have not been any effective drugs for treatment, with symptomatic treatment and prevention prevailing. The treatment plans of severe acute respiratory syndrome(SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome(MERS) are often used for reference in clinic. The advantages of traditional Chinese medicine(TCM) in treating SARS and MERS are that it can intervene and block the progression of disease in early stage, significantly reduce symptoms, shorten the treatment duration of patients, reduce complications and side effects caused by hormone therapy. The coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) belongs to the category of TCM epidemic diseases.

Despite widespread access and recommendations from public health authorities, influenza vaccine uptake remains suboptimal among HCWs. METHODS Our qualitative study used focus group discussions to identify and explain factors limiting influenza vaccine acceptance among HCWs in Singapore. A total of 73 doctors, nurses, allied health and ancillary staff across three public hospitals were included. RESULTS Challenges identified include a fear of contracting influenza from vaccination exacerbated by negative anecdotes regarding vaccine safety and efficacy, distrust of published efficacy data, uncertainty regarding relevance of existing data for Singapore, reluctance to introduce chemicals or overmedicate, pain from injection, low risk attributed to influenza and limited awareness of influenza transmission with a preference for alternatives in patient protection. Differences in attitudes were observed across vocational groups. Lack of overt promotion by hospital leadership in some institutions, perceived vaccine hesitancy among doctors, access, and work culture that implicitly encourages working through illness were further barriers. CONCLUSION Our findings highlight a combination of misperceptions about influenza vaccination and cognitive biases at the individual level, and challenges at the institutional level limiting uptake. Findings indicate an urgent need to provide targeted education and communication. Rather than providing more data, we recommend a widely-disseminated, locally-compiled synthesis addressing specific concerns of hesitant HCWs. Tailoring interventions to specific vocational groups should be considered. Institutional norms and culture may have a powerful influence in setting default behaviours: more effort is needed in improving influenza vaccine promotion and priority at some institutions, integrating vaccine-related communication with other infection control communication and addressing influenza vaccine hesitancy among doctors as a priority. Finally, further study of strategies to address cognitive biases affecting influenza vaccine acceptance in Singapore is desirable.","Sundaram, Neisha; Duckett, Kathryn; Yung, Chee Fu; Thoon, Koh Cheng; Sidharta, Sucitro; Venkatachalam, Indumathi; Chow, Angela; Yoong, Joanne",Vaccine,3,0

METHODS An analytical case-control study was performed comparing stillbirths from March to September 2020 (cases) and March to September 2019 (controls) in a tertiary care center in India. Modifiable factors were observed as level-I, level-II, and level-III delays. RESULTS A significant difference in the rate of stillbirths was found among cases (37.4/1000) and controls (29.9/1000) (P=0.045). Abruption in normotensive women was significantly higher in cases compared to controls (P=0.03). Modifiable factors or preventable causes were noted in 76.1% of cases and 59.6% of controls; the difference was highly significant (P<0.001, relative risk [RR] 1.8). Level-II delays or delays in reaching the hospital for delivery due to lack of transport were observed in 12.7% of cases compared to none in controls (P<0.006, RR 47.7). Level-III delays or delays in providing care at the facility were observed in 31.3% of cases and 11.5% of controls (P<0.001, RR 2.7).

In humans, the primary motor cortex (M1) in the two hemispheres shows significant anatomical, connectional, and electrophysiological differences associated with motor dominance. It is currently unclear whether the µ-oscillation phase effects on corticospinal excitability demonstrated previously for the motor-dominant M1 are also different between motor-dominant and motor-non-dominant M1 or, alternatively, are similar to reflect a ubiquitous physiological trait of the motor system at rest. Here, we applied single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation to the hand representations of the motor-dominant and the motor-non-dominant M1 of 51 healthy right-handed volunteers when electroencephalography indicated a certain µ-oscillation phase (positive peak, negative peak, or random). We determined resting motor threshold (RMT) as a marker of corticospinal excitability in the three µ-phase conditions. RMT differed significantly depending on the pre-stimulus phase of the µ-oscillation in both M1, with highest RMT in the positive-peak condition, and lowest RMT in the negative-peak condition. µ-phase-dependency of RMT correlated directly between the two M1, and interhemispheric differences in µ-phase-dependency were absent. In conclusion, µ-phase-dependency of corticospinal excitability appears to be a ubiquitous physiological trait of the motor system at rest, without hemispheric dominance.","Stefanou, Maria-Ioanna; Galevska, Dragana; Zrenner, Christoph; Ziemann, Ulf; Nieminen, Jaakko O",Scientific reports,3,33

The purpose of the present article is to examine the impact of this disturbing environment on Israeli women. Specifically, we examined whether fear of the virus would impact the women's distress symptoms, self-rated health (SRH), and marital satisfaction. A total of 130 Israeli married women with children completed the survey during the lockdown restrictions period. All participants reported that their children were living with them during the lockdown, and that no one had been infected by the virus. The results indicated that fear of COVID-19 was negatively associated with SRH as well as marital satisfaction, and positively associated with psychological distress. In addition, psychological distress mediated the link between fear of COVID-19 and both SRH and marital satisfaction. To mitigate similar negative consequences in the future, it is suggested that interventions should focus on the way the crisis is presented in the public domain. In addition, further research is recommended to identify the various indirect consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on psychological, physical, and relational aspects among women.","Reizer, Abira; Koslowsky, Meni; Geffen, Lilach",Health care for women international,3,31

Established agents are Lichtheimia corymbifera and L. ramosa, while L. ornata is a novel agent. Available data on a species-specific analysis of Lichtheimia infections are limited. METHODS The first case of a fatal rhino-orbital-cerebral infection in a hematopoietic stem cell transplantation recipient caused by L. ornata is reported; the agent was identified by sequencing the ITS ribosomal region. We reviewed the literature on mucormycosis due to Lichtheimia species between 2009 and 2018, with an analysis of risk factors and epidemiological and clinical data. RESULTS In addition to our Lichtheimia ornata case, 44 cases of human Lichtheimia were analyzed. Lichtheimia predominated in Europe (68.2%), followed by Asia (16%), and Africa (9%). The most common underlying condition was hematological malignancy (36.3%), followed by trauma/major surgery (27.3%), while diabetes mellitus was rare (11.4%). Site of infection was mostly skin and soft tissues (45.5%) and lung (25%), while relatively few cases were disseminated (13.6%) or rhinocerebral (11.4%). Mortality (36.4%) was mainly due to disseminated and rhinocerebral infections. CONCLUSION In contrast to Rhizopus, the most common agent of mucormycosis recorded in patients with diabetes mellitus, Lichtheimia infections were primarily associated with hematological malignancies and major skin barrier damage. Given the fact that classical rhinocerebral mucormycosis remains difficult to treat, independent of causative species, timely application of amphotericin B accessory to debridement may be required for patient survival.","Pan, Junling; Tsui, Clement; Li, Mengxing; Xiao, Kun; de Hoog, G Sybren; Verweij, Paul E; Cao, Yu; Lu, Hongguang; Jiang, Yanping",Mycopathologia,3,27

To assess whether the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in an increased prevalence of accidental hand sanitizer/alcoholic beverage exposure in children and adolescents, we compared pediatric hospitalization rates during COVID-19 and the previous year. For poisoning admissions during COVID-19, we also evaluated the cause by age and clinical outcomes. METHODS This retrospective data linkage study evaluated data from the Legal Medicine Organization (reporting mortalities) and hospitalization data from nine toxicology referral centers for alcohol-poisoned patients (age 0 to 18 years) for the study period (February 23 to June 22, 2020) and the pre-COVID-19 reference period (same dates in 2019). RESULTS Hospitalization rates due to ethanol and methanol exposure were significantly higher in 2020 (n = 375) than 2019 (n = 202; OR [95% CI] 1.9 [1.6, 2.2], p < 0.001). During COVID-19, in patients ≤15 years, the odds of intoxication from hand sanitizers were significantly higher than from alcoholic beverages, while in 15- to 18-year-olds, alcoholic beverage exposure was 6.7 times more common (95% CI 2.8, 16.1, p < 0.001). Of 375 children/adolescents hospitalized for alcoholic beverage and hand sanitizer exposure in 2020, six did not survive. The odds of fatal outcome were seven times higher in 15- to 18-year-olds (OR (95% CI) 7.0 (2.4, 20.1); p < 0.001). CONCLUSION The Iranian methanol poisoning outbreak during the first wave of COVID-19 was associated with significantly increased hospitalization rates among children and adolescents-including at least six pediatric in-hospital deaths from poisoning.

Therefore, our objective was to meta-analyse the effects of PJT on physical fitness attributes in basketball players, in comparison to a control condition. METHODS A systematic literature search was conducted in the databases PubMed, Web of Science, and SCOPUS, up to July 2020. Peer-reviewed controlled trials with baseline and follow-up measurements investigating the effects of PJT on physical fitness attributes (muscle power, i.e., jumping performance, linear sprint speed, change-of-direction speed, balance, and muscle strength) in basketball players, with no restrictions on their playing level, sex, or age. Hedge's g effect sizes (ES) were calculated for physical fitness variables. Using a random-effects model, potential sources of heterogeneity were selected, including subgroup analyses (age, sex, body mass, and height) and single training factor analysis (programme duration, training frequency, and total number of training sessions). Computation of meta-regression was also performed. RESULTS Thirty-two studies were included, involving 818 total basketball players. Significant (p<0.05) small-to-large effects of PJT were evident on vertical jump power (ES = 0.45), countermovement jump height with (ES = 1.24) and without arm swing (ES = 0.88), squat jump height (ES = 0.80), drop jump height (ES = 0.53), horizontal jump distance (ES = 0.65), linear sprint time across distances ≤10 m (ES = 1.67) and >10 m (ES = 0.92), change-of-direction performance time across distances ≤40 m (ES = 1.15) and >40 m (ES = 1.02), dynamic (ES = 1.16) and static balance (ES = 1.48), and maximal strength (ES = 0.57). The meta-regression revealed that training duration, training frequency and total number of sessions completed did not predict the effects of PJT on physical fitness attributes. Subgroup analysis indicated greater improvements in older compared to younger players in horizontal jump distance (>17.15 years, ES = 2.11; ≤17.15 years, ES = 0.10; p<0.001), linear sprint time >10 m (>16.3 years, ES = 1.83; ≤16.3 years, ES = 0.36; p = 0.010), and change-of-direction performance time ≤40 m (>16.3 years, ES = 1.65; ≤16.3 years, ES = 0.75; p = 0.005). Greater increases in horizontal jump distance were apparent with >2 compared with ≤2 weekly PJT sessions (ES = 2.12 and 0.39, respectively; p<0.001). CONCLUSION Data from 32 studies (28 of which demonstrate moderate-to-high methodological quality) indicate PJT improves muscle power, linear sprint speed, change-of-direction speed, balance, and muscle strength in basketball players independent of sex, age, or PJT programme variables. However, the beneficial effects of PJT as measured by horizontal jump distance, linear sprint time >10 m, and change-of-direction performance time ≤40 m, appear to be more evident among older basketball players.","Ramirez-Campillo, Rodrigo; Garcia-Hermoso, Antonio; Moran, Jason; Chaabene, Helmi; Negra, Yassine; Scanlan, Aaron T",Journal of sport and health science,3,7

The COVID-19 pandemic represents an acute environmental stressor during which it is possible to explore risk and resilience factors that contribute to postpartum outcomes. To investigate prenatal risk and resilience factors as predictors of postpartum depression and impaired mother-infant bonding, this study recruited a diverse cohort of 833 pregnant women from an urban medical center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and assessed them once during pregnancy in the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic (April-July 2020) and again at approximately twelve weeks postpartum. Adverse childhood experiences, prenatal depression and anxiety, and COVID-19-related distress predicted a greater likelihood of postpartum depression. Prenatal depression was the only unique predictor of impaired maternal-infant bonding after postpartum depression was controlled for. Women reporting greater emotion regulation, self-reliance, and nonhostile relationships had healthier postpartum outcomes. Policies to increase the number of nonspecialty providers providing perinatal mental health services as well as reimbursement for integrated care and access to mental health screening and care are needed to improve lifelong outcomes for women and their children.","Kornfield, Sara L; White, Lauren K; Waller, Rebecca; Njoroge, Wanjiku; Barzilay, Ran; Chaiyachati, Barbara H; Himes, Megan M; Rodriguez, Yuheiry; Riis, Valerie; Simonette, Keri; Elovitz, Michal A; Gur, Raquel E",Health affairs,3,24

METHODS We reviewed the clinical data of 41 patients with distal gastric cancer from the gastroenterology department of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University, from September 2018 to August 2019, who underwent totally laparoscopic distal gastrectomy. During the operation, the method of double layered end-to-end anastomosis with continuous manual suture was used for Billroth type I anastomosis to complete digestive tract reconstruction. All patients have been given a follow-up visit and gastroscopy three months after the operation. The peri-operative clinical information and postoperative follow-up information were collected for analysis, and the clinical application value was evaluated. RESULTS General information: male(n = 27), female(n = 14), age = 65.02(SD 9.94) years, and BMI = 23.52(SD 2.56) kg/m2, Tumor location: antrum(32,78.0%), angle (6,14.6%), and body (3,7.3%).

We developed and validated a diagnostic model that does not rely on computed tomography (CT) images to aid in the early identification of suspected COVID-19 pneumonia (S-COVID-19-P) patients admitted to adult fever clinics and made the validated model available via an online triage calculator. Methods Patients admitted from January 14 to February 26, 2020 with an epidemiological history of exposure to COVID-19 were included in the study [model development group (n=132) and validation group (n=32)]. Candidate features included clinical symptoms, routine laboratory tests, and other clinical information on admission. The features selection and model development were based on the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression. The primary outcome was the development and validation of a diagnostic aid model for the early identification of S-COVID-19-P on admission. Results The development cohort contained 26 cases of S-COVID-19-P and seven cases of confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia (C-COVID-19-P). The final selected features included one demographic variable, four vital signs, five routine blood values, seven clinical signs and symptoms, and one infection-related biomarker. The model's performance in the testing set and the validation group resulted in area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves (AUCs) of 0.841 and 0.938, F1 scores of 0.571 and 0.667, recall of 1.000 and 1.000, specificity of 0.727 and 0.778, and precision of 0.400 and 0.500, respectively. The top five most important features were age, interleukin-6 (IL-6), systolic blood pressure (SYS_BP), monocyte ratio (MONO%), and fever classification (FC). Based on this model, an optimized strategy for the early identification of S-COVID-19-P in fever clinics has also been designed. Conclusions A machine-learning model based solely on clinical information and not on CT images was able to perform the early identification of S-COVID-19-P on admission in fever clinics with a 100% recall score. This high-performing and validated model has been deployed as an online triage tool, which is available at https://intensivecare.shinyapps.io/COVID19/.","Feng, Cong; Wang, Lili; Chen, Xin; Zhai, Yongzhi; Zhu, Feng; Chen, Hua; Wang, Yingchan; Su, Xiangzheng; Huang, Sai; Tian, Lin; Zhu, Weixiu; Sun, Wenzheng; Zhang, Liping; Han, Qingru; Zhang, Juan; Pan, Fei; Chen, Li; Zhu, Zhihong; Xiao, Hongju; Liu, Yu; Liu, Gang; Chen, Wei; Li, Tanshi",Annals of translational medicine,3,1

METHODS A total of 595 parents of children hospitalised with acute respiratory illness across five tertiary hospitals in 2019 participated in an online survey. Multivariate logistic regression identified factors most strongly associated with influenza vaccination barriers. RESULTS Odds of influenza vaccination were lower with lack of health-care provider (HCP) recommendation (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 0.18; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.08-0.38); if parents had difficulties (aOR 0.19; 95% CI: 0.08-0.47) or were 'neutral' (aOR 0.23; 95% CI: 0.06-0.82) in remembering to make an appointment; and if parents had difficulties (aOR 0.21; 95% CI: 0.07-0.62) or were 'neutral' (aOR 0.24; 95% CI: 0.07-0.79) regarding getting an appointment for vaccination. Odds were also lower if parents did not believe (aOR 0.27; 95% CI: 0.08-0.90) or were 'neutral' (aOR 0.15; 95% CI: 0.04-0.49) regarding whether the people most important to them would have their child/ren vaccinated against influenza. Children had lower odds of vaccination if parents did not support (aOR 0.09; 95% CI: 0.01-0.82) or were ambivalent (aOR 0.09; 95% CI: 0.01-0.56) in their support for influenza vaccination. Finally, lack of history of influenza vaccination of child (aOR 0.38; 95% CI: 0.18-0.81) and respondent (aOR 0.25; 95% CI: 0.11-0.56) were associated with lack of receipt of influenza vaccine before admission for acute respiratory infection.

Proteins in plasma and BAL from two neutropenic rabbit models of IPA and Pseudomonas pneumonia were analyzed by SELDI-TOF MS. Hierarchical clustering analysis of plasma time course spectra demonstrated two clusters of peaks that were differentially regulated between IPA and Pseudomonas pneumonia (57 and 34 peaks, respectively, p<0.001). PCA of plasma proteins demonstrated a time-dependent separation of the two infections. A random forest analysis that ranked the top 30 spectral points distinguished between late Aspergillus and Pseudomonas pneumonias with 100% sensitivity and specificity. Based on spectral data analysis, three proteins were identified using SDS-PAGE and LC/MS and quantified using reverse phase arrays. Differences in the temporal sequence of plasma haptoglobin (p<0.001), apolipoprotein A1 (p<0.001) and transthyretin (p<0.038) were observed between IPA and Pseudomonas pneumonia, as was C-reactive protein (p<0.001). In summary, proteomic analysis of plasma and BAL proteins of experimental Aspergillus and Pseudomonas pneumonias demonstrates unique protein profiles with principal components and spectral regions that are shared in early infection and diverge at later stages of infection. Haptoglobin, apolipoprotein A1, transthyretin, and C-reactive protein are differentially expressed in these infections suggesting important contributions to host defense against IPA.","Gonzales, Denise A; De Torre, Carlos; Wang, Honghui; Devor, Christopher B; Munson, Peter J; Ying, Sai-Xia; Kern, Steven J; Petraitiene, Ruta; Levens, David L; Walsh, Thomas J; Suffredini, Anthony F",Proteomics,3,16

This paper proposes and evaluates a simple protocol for TST reading training. Primary care workers from different backgrounds received a 2-hour theoretical course, followed by a practical course on bleb reading. Blebs were obtained by injecting saline into sausages and then in volunteers. A certified trainer then evaluated the effectiveness of this protocol by analyzing the trainees' ability to read TST induration in clinical routine, blinded to each other's readings. Interobserver agreement was analyzed using the Bland-Altman test. The trainees' reading accuracy was calculated using two cut-off points - 5 and 10mm - and the effect of the number of readings was analyzed using a linear mixed model. Eleven healthcare workers read 53 saline blebs and 88 TST indurations, with high agreement for TST reading (0.07mm average bias). Sensitivity was 100% (94.6; 100.0) at 5mm cut-off and 87.3% (75.5; 94.7) at 10mm cut-off. The regression model found no effect of the number of readings [coefficient: -0.007 (-0.055; 0.040)]. A simple training protocol for reading TST with saline blebs simulations in sausages and volunteers was sufficient to achieve accurate TST induration readings, with no effect observed for the number of readings. Training with saline blebs injected into voluntary individuals is safer and easier than the traditional method.","Gloria, Lara de Lima; Bastos, Mayara Lisboa; Santos Júnior, Bráulio Dos; Trajman, Anete",Cadernos de saude publica,3,11

Although we will almost certainly continue to accumulate low-hanging fruit, where simple relationships will be found between the presence of a cultivatable agent and a disease, these successes will be increasingly infrequent. The future of the field rests instead in our ability to follow footprints of infectious agents that cannot be characterized using classical microbiological techniques and to develop the laboratory and computational infrastructure required to dissect complex host-microbe interactions. I have tried to refine the criteria used by Koch and successors to prove linkage to disease.

Face masks are believed to protect people from infection by blocking those droplets. However, current filtration efficiency tests can't evaluate masks under sneeze-like pressure. The goal of this study was to establish a method to evaluate the filtration efficiency of mask materials under extreme conditions. MATERIALS AND METHODS Efficiency of surgical masks, gauze masks, gauze, cotton, silk, linen and tissue paper on blocking micro-droplet sized starch particles (average 8.2 μm) and latex microspheres (0.75 μm) with a velocity of 44.4 m/s created by centrifugation was qualitatively analyzed by using imaging-based analysis. RESULTS The 4 layers of silk could block 93.8% of microspheres and 88.9% of starch particles, followed by the gauze mask (78.5% of microspheres and 90.4% of starch particles) and the 2 layers of cotton (74.6% of microspheres and 87.5-89.0% of particles). Other materials also blocked 53.2-66.5% of microspheres and 76.4%-87.9% of particles except the 8 layers of gauze which only blocked 36.7% of particles. The filtration efficiency was improved by the increased layers of materials. CONCLUSION Centrifugation-based filtration efficiency test not only compensates shortcomings of current tests for masks, but also offers a simple way to explore new mask materials during pandemics. Common mask materials can potentially provide protection against respiratory droplet transmission.","Xiao, L I; Sakagami, Hiroshi; Miwa, Nobuhiko",In vivo,3,1

UFH has antiviral effects and prevents the SARS-CoV-2 virus' entry into mammalian cells. In addition, UFH has significant anti-inflammatory and anti-coagulant properties, which limit progression of lung injury and vascular pulmonary thrombosis. METHODS AND INTERVENTION The INHALEd nebulised unfractionated HEParin for the treatment of hospitalised patients with COVID-19 (INHALE-HEP) meta-trial is a prospective individual patient data analysis of on-going randomised controlled trials and early phase studies. Individual studies are being conducted in multiple countries. Participating studies randomise adult patients admitted to the hospital with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, who do not require immediate mechanical ventilation, to inhaled nebulised UFH or standard care. All studies collect a minimum core dataset. The primary outcome for the meta-trial is intubation (or death, for patients who died before intubation) at day 28. The secondary outcomes are oxygenation, clinical worsening and mortality, assessed in time-to-event analyses. Individual studies may have additional outcomes. ANALYSIS We use a Bayesian approach to monitoring, followed by analysing individual patient data, outcomes and adverse events. All analyses will follow the intention-to-treat principle, considering all participants in the treatment group to which they were assigned, except for cases lost to follow-up or withdrawn.

The introduction of quality measurement and reporting has been successful in establishing standards of care, reducing disparities in receipt of care, and improving other aspects of cancer care outcomes within and across providers. The authors propose the development and adoption of financial hardship screening and management as an additional quality metric for oncology practices. They suggest relevant stakeholders, conveners, and approaches for developing, testing, and implementing a screening and management tool and advocate for endorsement by organizations such as the National Quality Forum and professional societies for oncology care clinicians. The confluence of increasingly high-cost care and widening disparities in ability to pay because of underinsurance and lack of health insurance coverage makes a strong argument to take steps to mitigate the financial consequences of cancer.","Bradley, Cathy J; Yabroff, K Robin; Zafar, S Yousuf; Shih, Ya-Chen Tina",CA: a cancer journal for clinicians,3,24

INTENDED USERS Gynaecologists, obstetricians, family physicians, general surgeons, emergency medicine specialists, radiologists, sonographers, nurses, medical learners, residents, and fellows. TARGET POPULATION Adult women 18 years of age and older presenting for the evaluation of an adnexal mass. OPTIONS Women with adnexal masses should be assessed for personal risk factors, history, and physical findings. Initial evaluation should also include imaging and laboratory testing to triage women for management of their care either by a gynaecologic oncologist or as per SOGC guideline no. 404 on the initial investigation and management of benign ovarian masses. EVIDENCE A search of PubMed, Cochrane Wiley, and the Cochrane systematic reviews was conducted in January 2018 for English-language materials involving human subjects published since 2000 using three sets of terms: (i) ovarian cancer, ovarian carcinoma, adnexal disease, ovarian neoplasm, adnexal mass, fallopian tube disease, fallopian tube neoplasm, ovarian cyst, and ovarian tumour; (ii) the above terms in combination with predict neoplasm staging, follow-up, and staging; and (iii) the above two sets of terms in combination with ultrasound, tumour marker, CA 125, CEA, CA19-9, HE4, multivariable-index-assay, risk-of-ovarian-malignancy-algorithm, risk-of-malignancy-index, diagnostic imaging, CT, MRI, and PET. Relevant evidence was selected for inclusion in descending order of quality of evidence as follows: meta-analyses, systematic reviews, guidelines, randomized controlled trials, prospective cohort studies, observational studies, non-systematic reviews, case series, and reports. Additional articles were identified through cross-referencing the identified reviews. The total number of studies identified was 2350, with 59 being included in this review. VALIDATION METHODS The content and recommendations were drafted and agreed upon by the authors. The Executive and Board of the Society of Gynecologic Oncology of Canada reviewed the content and submitted comments for consideration. The Board of Directors of the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada approved the final draft for publication. The quality of evidence was rated using the criteria described in the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology framework (Table A1 of Online Appendix A). See Table A2 of Online Appendix A for the interpretation of strong and weak recommendations. The summary of findings is available upon request. BENEFITS, HARMS, COSTS Adnexal masses are common, and guidelines on how to triage them and manage the care of patients presenting with adnexal masses will continue to guide the practice of primary care providers and gynaecologists. Ovarian cancer outcomes are improved when initial surgery is performed by a gynaecologic oncologist, likely as a result of complete surgical staging and optimal cytoreduction. Given these superior outcomes, guidelines to assist in the triage of adnexal masses and the referral and management of the care of patients with an adnexal mass are critical.

Type I interferons (IFNs) play a crucial role in antiviral immunity. In the present study, we demonstrated that infection with the highly pathogenic PRRSV strain JXwn06 antagonized type I IFN expression induced by poly(I·C) in both porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) and blood monocyte-derived macrophages (BMo). Subsequently, we showed that the inhibition of poly(I·C)-induced IFN-β production by PRRSV was dependent on the blocking of NF-κB signaling pathways. By screening PRRSV nonstructural and structural proteins, we demonstrated that nonstructural protein 4 (nsp4), a viral 3C-like serine protease, significantly suppressed IFN-β expression. Moreover, we verified that nsp4 inhibited NF-κB activation induced by signaling molecules, including RIG-I, VISA, TRIF, and IKKβ. nsp4 was shown to target the NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO) at the E349-S350 site to mediate its cleavage. Importantly, nsp4 mutants with defective protease activity abolished its ability to cleave NEMO and inhibit IFN-β production. These findings might have implications for our understanding of PRRSV pathogenesis and its mechanisms for evading the host immune response. IMPORTANCE Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is a major agent of respiratory diseases in pigs. Like many other viruses, PRRSV has evolved a variety of strategies to evade host antiviral innate immunity for survival and propagation. In this study, we show that PRRSV nsp4 is a novel antagonist of the NF-κB signaling pathway, which is responsible for regulating the expression of type I interferons and other crucial cytokines. We then investigated the underlying mechanism used by nsp4 to suppress NF-κB-mediated IFN-β production. We found that nsp4 interfered with the NF-κB signaling pathway through the cleavage of NEMO (a key regulator of NF-κB signaling) at the E349-S350 site, leading to the downregulation of IFN-β production induced by poly(I·C). The data presented here may help us to better understand PRRSV pathogenesis.","Huang, Chen; Zhang, Qiong; Guo, Xue-kun; Yu, Zhi-bin; Xu, Ao-tian; Tang, Jun; Feng, Wen-hai",Journal of virology,3,31

Early diagnosis is key; catching a disease in its early stages can be the difference between fatality and treatment. The challenge with many diseases is that detectability of the disease scales with disease progression. Since single molecule sensors, e.g., nanopores, can sense biomolecules at low concentrations, they have the potential to become clinically relevant in many of today's medical settings. With nanopore-based sensing, lower volumes and concentrations are required for detection, enabling it to be clinically beneficial. Other advantages to using nanopores include that they are tunable to an enormous variety of molecules, boast low costs, and fabrication is scalable for manufacturing. We discuss previous reports and the potential for incorporating nanopores into the medical field for early diagnostics, therapeutic monitoring, and identifying relapse/recurrence.","Lastra, Lauren S; Sharma, Vinay; Farajpour, Nasim; Nguyen, Michelle; Freedman, Kevin J","Nanomedicine : nanotechnology, biology, and medicine",3,7

AIM Comparison of the performance of the SharkCore™ needles with the standard EUS-FNA needles for the diagnosis of solid upper GI masses. PATIENTS AND METHODS Single-center, retrospective cohort study in an academic tertiary referral hospital. Patients were matched 1:1 for the site of the lesion and the presence or absence of rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE). RESULTS A total of 102 patients were included. There was no statistically significant difference in the mean number of passes (3.3 ± 1.3 versus 3.4 ± 1.5; p = .89). Similar results were observed at the subgroup with ROSE (4.3 ± 1.3 versus 3.7 ± 1.5; p = .26). More histological specimens were obtained with the SharkCore™ needles compared to standard needles (59 versus 5%; p < .001). Diagnostic test characteristics were not significantly different (sensitivity: 91.5 versus 85.7; specificity: 100 versus 100%; accuracy: 92.2 versus 85.4% for SharkCore™ versus standard needles, p > .05 in all cases).

However, there is lack of sustained improvement in 30 to 46% of infants. Aerosolized prostaglandins I2 (PGI2) and E1 (PGE1) have been reported to be effective selective pulmonary vasodilators. The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of inhaled PGE1 (IPGE1) in NHRF. METHODS Two pilot multicenter phase II RCTs are included in this report. In the first pilot, late preterm and term neonates with NHRF, who had an oxygenation index (OI) of ≥15 and <25 on two arterial blood gases and had not previously received INO, were randomly assigned to receive two doses of IPGE1 (300 and 150 ng/kg/min) or placebo. The primary outcome was the enrollment of 50 infants in six to nine months at 10 sites. The first pilot was halted after four months for failure to enroll a single infant. The most common cause for non-enrollment was prior initiation of INO. In a re-designed second pilot, co-administration of IPGE1 and INO was permitted. Infants with suboptimal response to INO received either aerosolized saline or IPGE1 at a low (150 ng/kg/min) or high dose (300 ng/kg/min) for a maximum duration of 72 hours. The primary outcome was the recruitment of an adequate number of patients (n = 50) in a nine-month-period, with fewer than 20% protocol violations. RESULTS No infants were enrolled in the first pilot. Seven patients were enrolled in the second pilot; three in the control, two in the low-dose IPGE1, and two in the high-dose IPGE1 groups. The study was halted for recruitment futility after approximately six months as enrollment targets were not met. No serious adverse events, one minor protocol deviation and one pharmacy protocol violation were reported. CONCLUSIONS These two pilot RCTs failed to recruit adequate eligible newborns with NHRF. Complex management RCTs of novel therapies for persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) may require novel study designs and a longer period of time from study approval to commencement of enrollment.

From the first reported cases in December 2019, the virus has spread to over 4 million people worldwide. Human-to-human transmission occurs mainly through the aerosolization of respiratory droplets. Transmission also occurs through contact with contaminated surfaces and other fomites. Improved antisepsis of human and nonhuman surfaces has been identified as a key feature of transmission reduction. There are no previous studies of povidone iodine (PVP-I) against SARS-CoV-2. This study evaluated nasal and oral antiseptic formulations of PVP-I for virucidal activity against SARS-CoV-2. This is the first report on the efficacy of PVP-I against the virus that causes COVID-19. METHODS Povidone iodine nasal antiseptic formulations and PVP-I oral rinse antiseptic formulations from 1% to 5% concentrations as well as controls were studied for virucidal efficacy against the SARS-CoV-2. Test compounds were evaluated for ability to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 as measured in a virucidal assay. SARS-CoV-2 was exposed directly to the test compound for 60 seconds, compounds were then neutralized, and surviving virus was quantified. RESULTS All concentrations of nasal antiseptics and oral rinse antiseptics evaluated completely inactivated the SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSIONS Nasal and oral PVP-I antiseptic solutions are effective at inactivating the SARS-CoV-2 at a variety of concentrations after 60-second exposure times. The formulations tested may help to reduce the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 if used for nasal decontamination, oral decontamination, or surface decontamination in known or suspected cases of COVID-19.","Pelletier, Jesse S; Tessema, Belachew; Frank, Samantha; Westover, Jonna B; Brown, Seth M; Capriotti, Joseph A","Ear, nose, & throat journal",3,16

The heterogeneous nature of asthma may be attributed to a complex interplay between risk factors (either intrinsic or extrinsic) and specific pathogens such as respiratory viruses, and even bacteria. The intrinsic risk factors are highly correlated with asthma exacerbation in host, which may be mediated via genetic polymorphisms, enhanced airway epithelial lysis, apoptosis, and exaggerated viral replication in infected cells, resulting in reduced innate immune response and concomitant reduction of interferon (types I, II, and III) synthesis. The canonical features of allergic asthma include strong Th2-related inflammation, sensitivity to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), eosinophilia, enhanced levels of Th2 cytokines, goblet cell hyperplasia, airway hyper-responsiveness, and airway remodeling. However, the NSAID-resistant non-Th2 asthma shows a characteristic neutrophilic influx, Th1/Th17 or even mixed (Th17-Th2) immune response and concurrent cytokine streams. Moreover, inhaled corticosteroid-resistant asthma may be associated with multifactorial innate and adaptive responses. In this review, we will discuss the findings of various in vivo and ex vivo models to establish the critical heterogenic asthmatic etiologies, host-pathogen relationships, humoral and cell-mediated immune responses, and subsequent mechanisms underlying asthma exacerbation triggered by respiratory viral infections.","Hossain, Ferdaus Mohd Altaf; Choi, Jin Young; Uyangaa, Erdenebileg; Park, Seong Ok; Eo, Seong Kug",Immune network,3,1

The purpose of this survey-based study was to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on radiology resident training and education workflow in Canada in terms of the nature, scale, and heterogeneity of the changes, preparedness and adaptation, and perceptions of the present and future of radiology training. METHODS A 30-question web-based survey was sent to 17 radiology residency program directors across Canada. A separate 32-question survey was sent to 460 residents currently enrolled in a radiology residency in Canada. These surveys were open for 3 weeks. RESULTS We received responses from 16 program directors and 80 residents (response rates 94.1% and 17.4%, respectively). Most respondents agreed that objectives were being met for knowledge and interpretation but less so for case volumes and technical skills. Less time was allotted for on-site activities (eg, readouts) with more time for off-site activities (eg, videoconferencing). Daytime rotations were at least partly cancelled. Most respondents felt these changes were met with enthusiasm by both faculty and residents. However, there were perceived challenges including lack of training on virtual platforms for delivery of teaching and decreased staff-resident interaction, with short- and long-term anxiety reported. CONCLUSIONS The coronavirus disease 2019 has dramatically changed radiology resident training in Canada, with increased virtual learning at the expense of cancelled rotations and the resultant reduction in case volumes and staff-resident interaction. Although adopted with enthusiasm, these changes present substantial challenges and anxiety regarding the future of radiology resident education.","Warnica, William; Moody, Alan; Probyn, Linda; Bartlett, Eric; Singh, Navneet; Pakkal, Mini",Canadian Association of Radiologists journal = Journal l'Association canadienne des radiologistes,3,1

These molecules enhanced the binding of Lassa virus to cells and mediated infection independently of dystroglycan. Axl- or Tyro3-mediated infection required intracellular signaling via the tyrosine kinase activity of Axl or Tyro3, whereas DC-SIGN- or LSECtin-mediated infection and binding were dependent on a specific carbohydrate and on ions.

The aims of this study were: (i) to assess the bleeding reduction effect by occlusion of the hepatic artery in LH; and (ii) to evaluate the risk of carbon dioxide (CO2 ) gas embolism (GE) in the case of high pneumoperitoneum (PP). METHODS Nine piglets underwent laparoscopic left medial lobe and left lateral lobe resection, receiving either occlusion of the hepatic artery (hepatic artery clamping group: HACG, n = 9) or no occlusion (hepatic artery declamping group: HADCG, n = 9) using a PP of 15 mmHg. In addition, we observed changes in hemodynamics induced by PP. The state of GE was observed using transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) during LH (n = 8). GE was graded as grade 0 (none), grade 1 (minor), and grade 2 (major). RESULTS The HACG had significantly less bleeding compared to the HADCG (P < 0.01). During LH, four animals showed grade 1 (37.5%) and one animal showed grade 2 (12.5%) GE at 15 mmHg. At 20 mmHg, all animals showed grade 2 (100%) GE. CONCLUSION The occlusion of the hepatic artery in LH reduces blood loss. The control of bleeding from the hepatic vein is feasible with a high PP, but there is a possibility of GE.","Makabe, Kenji; Nitta, Hiroyuki; Takahara, Takeshi; Hasegawa, Yasushi; Kanno, Shoji; Nishizuka, Satoshi; Sasaki, Akira; Wakabayashi, Go",Journal of hepato-biliary-pancreatic sciences,3,7

Since the first reports in the 1980s, laparoscopy has become the standard for cholecystectomy, with many advantages over open procedures. Now a natural-orifice approach to the peritoneal cavity may further reduce the invasiveness of surgery by either diminishing or avoiding abdominal incisions. Several orifice routes to the abdominal cavity have been described: transgastric, transvaginal, transvesical, and transcolonic. Although most experiences with the porcine model showed the possibility of these approaches, few surgeons reported experiences with humans. The authors present their complete early experience with transgastric (TG) and transvaginal (TV) cholecystectomies in human beings. METHODS Thirty-nine patients (4 males and 35 females) underwent hybrid NOTES procedures from January 2007 to January 2009. The mean age was 46 years (range = 19-83). The body mass index ranged from 20 to 41 and ASA was I-II. Transgastric (TG) cholecystectomy was performed in 27 patients and 12 patients had a transvaginal (TV) cholecystectomy. RESULTS The mean operative time was 140 min. Although operative times were slightly shorter in the TG group 005B137 +/- 34.6 min (range = 75-195)] compared to the TV route [147 +/- 31.5 min (range = 95-220)], there were no significant differences between the two groups (p = 0.5, Mann-Whitney U test). Patients were started on liquids within 1 h and discharged 2 h later, except the last 11 TG patients, who went home 24 h later because of enrollment in a separate protocol. An overall 20% morbidity rate and no mortality were found. The complication rates for the TG and TV groups were 18% (5/27) and 25% (3/12), respectively, which was not statistically significant (p = 0.6, chi(2) test). Seventy-five percent of complications (6/8) occurred the first year and 25% (2/8) during the second year of our experience. CONCLUSION Transgastric and transvaginal cholecystectomies are feasible. Although these NOTES procedures were laparoscopically assisted and current flexible endoscopes were used, it seems possible that major intra-abdominal surgeries may one day be performed without skin incisions. However, a learning curve is mandatory and, although there were no major bile duct injuries, there were NOTES-related complications. These trends toward incisionless surgery demand coordinated research in an interdisciplinary setting involving both surgeons and device manufacturers to further define appropriate indications, contraindications, and applications for natural-orifice surgery.","Salinas, Gustavo; Saavedra, Lil; Agurto, Hellen; Quispe, Rosa; Ramírez, Edwin; Grande, José; Tamayo, Juan; Sánchez, Victoria; Málaga, Daniel; Marks, Jeffrey M",Surgical endoscopy,3,26

METHODS Patients with newly diagnosed early HCC who received surgical resection (SR) or percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) with or without transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) from January 2003 to December 2016 were enrolled. The cumulative overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) rates were compared. A polytomous logistic regression was used to estimate factors for early and late recurrence. Independent predictors of OS were identified using Cox proportional hazard regression. RESULTS One hundred twenty-five patients underwent SR, and 176 patients underwent RFA, of whom 72 were treated with TACE followed by RFA. Neither match analysis based on propensity score nor multiple adjustment regression yielded a significant difference in DFS and OS between the two groups. Multivariate analysis showed high AFP (> 20 ng/mL), and multinodularity significantly increased risk of early recurrence (< 1 year). In contrast, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus and multinodularity were significantly associated with late recurrence (> 1 year). Multivariate Cox regression with recurrent events as time-varying covariates identified older age (HR = 1.55, 95% CI:1.01-2.36), clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH) (HR = 1.97, 95% CI:1.26-3.08), early recurrence (HR = 6.62, 95% CI:3.79-11.6) and late recurrence (HR = 3.75, 95% CI:1.99-7.08) as independent risk factors of mortality. A simple risk score showed fair calibration and discrimination in early HCC patients after primary curative treatment. In the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage A subgroup, SR significantly improved DFS compared to RFA with or without TACE. CONCLUSION Host and tumor factors rather than the initial treatment modalities determine the outcomes of early HCC after primary curative treatment. Statistical models based on recurrence types can predict early HCC prognosis but further external validation is necessary.","Kuo, Ming-Jeng; Mo, Lein-Ray; Chen, Chi-Ling",BMC cancer,3,26

RESULTS 201 studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria and reported 205 time-based criteria for RTR. The median time from when RTR was permitted was 12 postoperative weeks (IQR=3.3, range 5-39 weeks). Fewer than one in five studies used additional clinical, strength or performance-based criteria for decision-making regarding RTR. Aside from time, the most frequently reported criteria for RTR were: full knee range of motion or >95% of the non-injured knee plus no pain or pain <2 on visual analogue scale; isometric extensor limb symmetry index (LSI)>70% plus extensor and flexor LSI>70%; and hop test LSI>70%. CONCLUSIONS Fewer than one in five studies reported clinical, strength or performance-based criteria for RTR even though best evidence recommends performance-based criteria combined with time-based criteria to commence running activities following ACL reconstruction.","Rambaud, Alexandre J M; Ardern, Clare L; Thoreux, Patricia; Regnaux, Jean-Philippe; Edouard, Pascal",British journal of sports medicine,3,1

With a view to assessing VLSM's validity, the present study analyzed the technique's ability to determine the known clinical-anatomic correlates of hemiparesis in stroke patients. DESIGN Lesions (damaged in at least 5 patients) associated with transformed limb motor score (after adjustment on lesion volume) at 6 months were examined in 272 patients using VLSM. The value of additional multivariable linear, logistic and Bayesian analyses was examined. RESULTS We first checked that motor hemiparesis was fully accounted for by corticospinal tract (CST) lesions (sensitivity = 100%; p = 0.0001). Conventional VLSM analysis flagged up 2 regions corresponding to the CST, but also 8 regions located outside the CST. All 10 brain regions achieving statistical significance in the VLSM analysis were submitted to 3 additional analyses. The backward linear regression analysis selected 5 regions, one only corresponding to the CST (R2: 0.03, p = 0.0008). The logistic regression analysis selected correctly the CST (OR: 2.39, 95%CI: 1.44-3.96; 0.001). The Bayesian network analysis selected regions including the CST (in 92% of 3000 bootstrap replications) and identified the source of multicollinearity. These lesions evaluated by structural equation modeling resulted in an excellent fit (p-value = 0.228, chi/df = 1.19, RMSEA = 0.032, CFI = 0.999). Analyses of confusion factors showed that conventional VLSM analyses were strongly influenced by lesion frequency (R2 = 0.377; p = 0.0001) and multicollinearity. CONCLUSIONS Conventional VLSM analyses are sensitive but weakened by a type I error due to the combined effects of multicollinearity and lesion frequency. We demonstrate that the addition of a Bayesian network analysis, and to a lesser extent of logistic regression, controlled for this type I error and constituted a reliable means of defining the functional anatomy of the motor system in stroke patients.","Arnoux, Audrey; Toba, Monica N; Duering, Marco; Diouf, Momar; Daouk, Joel; Constans, Jean-Marc; Puy, Laurent; Barbay, Mélanie; Godefroy, Olivier",Neuropsychologia,3,1

This prospective pilot study evaluates perioperative markers of pancreatitis and systemic inflammation to predict clinically relevant grade B/C-POPF (CR-POPF). METHODS All patients undergoing pancreatic resection from December 2017 to April 2019 were prospectively enrolled. Surgical procedures and outcomes were correlated with perioperative blood markers. ROC analysis was performed to assess their predictive value for CR-POPF. Cut-offs were calculated with the Youden index. RESULTS In total, 70 patients were analysed (43 pancreatoduodenectomies and 27 distal pancreatectomies). In-hospital/90-d mortality and morbidity were 5.7/7.1% (n = 4/n = 5) and 75.7% (n = 53). Major complications (Clavien-Dindo ≥ 3a) occurred in 28 (40.0%) patients, CR-POPF in 20 (28.6%) patients. Serum lipase (cut-off > 51U/L) and IL-6 (> 56.5 ng/l) on POD3 were significant predictors for CR-POPF (AUC = 0.799, 95%-CI 0.686-0.912 and AUC = 0.784, 95%-CI 0.668-0.900; combined AUC = 0.858, 95%-CI 0.758-0.958; all p < 0.001). Patients with both or one factor(s) above cut-off more frequently developed CR-POPF than cases without (100 vs. 50% vs. 7.5%, p < 0.001). This also applied for overall and severe complications (p = 0.013 and p = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS Post-operative pancreatitis and inflammatory response are major determinants for development of POPF. A combination of serum lipase and IL-6 on POD3 is a highly significant early predictor of CR-POPF and overall complications, potentially guiding patient management.

We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of desmoteplase, a fibrin-dependent plasminogen activator, given between 3 h and 9 h after symptom onset in patients with occlusion or high-grade stenosis in major cerebral arteries. METHODS In a prospective, double-blind, multicentre, parallel-group, randomised trial, we enrolled patients from 77 hospitals in 17 countries who had ischaemic stroke and occlusion or high-grade stenosis in major cerebral arteries. We randomly assigned patients in a 1:1 ratio, using computer-generated randomisation lists with stratification for baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale and age, to treatment with desmoteplase (90 μg/kg) given 3-9 h after symptom onset or to placebo. Patients, investigators, staff, and the funder were masked to treatment assignment. The primary outcome was a favourable modified Rankin Scale score (0-2) at day 90 in all treated patients who had at least one postbaseline measurement of the modified Rankin Scale. Safety was assessed in all randomly assigned patients who received study drugs. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00790920. FINDINGS Between Feb 6, 2009, and Nov 27, 2013, we enrolled 492 patients and randomly assigned 247 to desmoteplase and 245 to placebo (236 in the desmoteplase group and 237 in the placebo group were included in the analysis of the primary endpoint). Median time from stroke onset to treatment was 6·9 h (IQR 5·7-8·0) for placebo and 7·0 h (6·0-7·9) for desmoteplase. Modified Rankin Scale score (0-2) at day 90 occurred in 121 (51%) patients given desmoteplase and 118 (50%) patients given placebo (adjusted odds ratio 1·20, 95% CI 0·79-1·81, p=0·40). 24 (10%) of 240 patients given desmoteplase died compared with 23 (10%) of 238 patients given placebo. Serious adverse events occurred in 64 (27%) of 240 patients receiving desmoteplase compared with 69 (29%) of 238 patients receiving placebo; frequency of symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage (six [3%] patients in the desmoteplase group vs five [2%] in the placebo group), symptomatic cerebral oedema (five [2%] vs four [2%]), and major haemorrhage (ten [4%] vs 15 [6%]) was much the same between treatment groups. INTERPRETATION Treatment with desmoteplase did not cause safety concerns and did not improve functional outcome when given to patients who had ischaemic stroke and major cerebral artery occlusion beyond 3 h of symptom onset.

Some patients are unable to achieve target blood pressures despite multiple antihypertensive medications; these patients are labeled as having resistant hypertension. To palliate the lack of pharmacologic options, recent technological advances led to the development of an interventional procedure to treat hypertension, namely renal sympathetic denervation. This percutaneous procedure involves the ablation of the afferent and efferent nerves surrounding the renal arteries. Many studies that were primarily observational in nature had very promising results. Systolic blood pressure reductions in the order of 25-30 mm Hg were observed in a series of unblinded studies, leading to the approval and widespread use of this technology across Europe, Australia, and Canada. However, a recent rigorous single blinded sham-controlled clinical trial failed to meet its efficacy endpoints. There are several postulated reasons for the conflicting results, which are discussed in this manuscript. These recent findings make us reflect on the need for rigorous clinical trials prior to the early approval and clinical adoption of novel technologies. At the moment, renal denervation remains an investigational procedure. Several trials are underway using different technologies, which, upon completion, will clarify the proper role of renal denervation for the treatment of patients with resistant hypertension.","Davis, Mark; Schiffrin, Ernesto L; Joyal, Dominique",Current treatment options in cardiovascular medicine,3,7

OBJECTIVES We aimed to analyze the correlation between six different meteorological parameters and the dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic in 16 administrative regions (voivodeships) of Poland. PATIENTS AND METHODS Current analysis was based on data acquired from epidemiological reports published by the Polish Ministry of Health. For each of the 16 voivodeships, one synoptic station was selected to provide data on six meteorology parameters: maximum daily temperature, minimum daily temperature, variability of daily temperature, sunshine duration, relative humidity and wind speed. RESULTS For all voivodeships, new COVID-19 cases were correlated with relative humidity (0.41), maximum daily temperature (-0.41), variability of daily temperature (-0.40), and sunshine duration (0.35). For all parameters, a similar time lag was obtained between -14 and -10 days. Such correlation for the wind speed was not statistically significant for most of the voivodeships. New hospitalizations due to the COVID-19 were correlated with the daily maximum temperature (-0.48 with a time lag of -10 days) and sunshine duration (-0.45 with a time lag of -10 days). CONCLUSIONS The delayed effects (10-14 days lag) of the meteorological factors on the incidence of COVID-19 and the risk of hospitalization due to the COVID-19 were observed. Relative humidity and the maximum daily temperature had the highest impact on the dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic in each of the 16 administrative regions in Poland.","Bochenek, Bogdan; Jankowski, Mateusz; Gruszczynska, Marta; Jaczewski, Adam; Ziemianski, Michal; Pyrc, Robert; Wyszogrodzki, Andrzej; Nykiel, Grzegorz; Kopaczka, Diana; Figurski, Mariusz; Pinkas, Jaroslaw",Polish archives of internal medicine,3,31

Studies related to respiratory tract pathogenesis or drug toxicity testing in the past made use of basic systems where single cell populations were exposed to test agents followed by evaluations of simple cellular responses. Although these simple single-cell-type systems provided good basic information related to cellular responses, much more can be learned from cells grown in fabricated microenvironments which mimic in vivo conditions in specialized microfabricated chambers or by human tissue engineered three-dimensional (3D) models which allow for more natural interactions between cells. Recent advances in microengineering technology, microfluidics, and tissue engineering have provided a new approach to the development of 2D and 3D cell culture models which enable production of more robust human in vitro respiratory tract models. Complex models containing multiple cell phenotypes also provide a more reasonable approximation of what occurs in vivo without the confounding elements in the dynamic in vivo environment. The goal of engineering good 3D human models is the formation of physiologically functional respiratory tissue surrogates which can be used as pathogenesis models or in the case of 2D screening systems for drug therapy evaluation as well as human toxicity testing. We hope that this manuscript will serve as a guide for development of future respiratory tract model systems as well as a review of conventional models.","Nichols, Joan E; Niles, Jean A; Vega, Stephanie P; Argueta, Lissenya B; Eastaway, Adriene; Cortiella, Joaquin",Experimental biology and medicine,3,17

OBJECTIVE To compare droplet digital PCR (ddPCR), IHC, and RNAish to detect SARS-CoV-2 in FFPE tissue in a large series of lung specimens from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. DESIGN ddPCR and RNAish used commercially available probes; IHC utilized clone 1A9. Twenty-six autopsies of COVID-19 patients with FFPE tissue blocks of 62 lung specimens, 22 heart specimens, 2 brain specimens, and 1 liver, and 1 umbilical cord were included. Control cases included 9 autopsy lungs from patients with other infections/inflammation and virus-infected tissue or cell lines. RESULTS ddPCR had the highest sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 (96%) when compared to IHC (31%) and RNAish (36%). All 3 tests had a specificity of 100%. Agreement between ddPCR and IHC or RNAish was fair (κ=0.23, κ=0.35, respectively). Agreement between IHC and ISH was substantial (κ=0.75). Interobserver reliability was almost perfect for IHC (κ=0.91) and fair to moderate for RNAish (κ=0.38-0.59). Lung tissues from patients who died earlier after onset of symptoms revealed higher copy numbers by ddPCR (P=.03, pearson corr = -0.65) and were more likely to be positive by RNAish (P=.02) than lungs from patients who died later. SARS-CoV-2 was identified in hyaline membranes, pneumocytes, and rarely in respiratory epithelium. ddPCR showed low copy numbers in 7 autopsy hearts from ProteoGenex Inc. All other extrapulmonary tissues were negative. CONCLUSIONS ddPCR was the most sensitive and highly specific test to identify SARS-CoV-2 in lung specimens from COVID-19 patients.","Roden, Anja C; Vrana, Julie A; Koepplin, Justin W; Hudson, Angela E; Norgan, Andrew P; Jenkinson, Garrett; Yamaoka, Satoko; Ebihara, Hideki; Monroe, Robert; Szabolcs, Matthias J; Majumdar, Ramanath; Moyer, Ann M; García, Joaquín J; Kipp, Benjamin R",Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,3,20

OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to summarize the literature regarding the associations between Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) patient experiences and clinical and quality outcomes. RESEARCH DESIGN A systematic review of the literature was completed using PubMed, Embase, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature on December 14, 2019. Separate searches were conducted to query terms identifying CAHPS surveys with clinical and quality outcomes of care. Two reviewers completed all components of the search process. STUDY SELECTION Studies investigating associations between CAHPS composite ratings and health care sensitive clinical outcomes or quality measures of care were included in this review. Studies were excluded if they did not investigate patient experiences using CAHPS composite ratings or if CAHPS composites were not treated as the independent variable. RESULTS Nineteen studies met inclusion criteria, 10 investigating associations of CAHPS composite ratings with clinical outcomes and 9 investigating these associations with quality measures. Patient-provider communication was the most studied CAHPS composite rating and was significantly associated with self-reported physical and mental health, frequency of emergency room visits and inpatient hospital stays, hospitalization length, and CAHPS personal physician global ratings. CONCLUSIONS Ratings of patient experience with care may influence clinical and quality outcomes of care. However, key inconsistencies between studies affirm that more research is needed to solidify this conclusion and investigate how patient experiences differentially relate to outcomes for various patient groups.","Navarro, Stephanie; Ochoa, Carol Y; Chan, Emily; Du, Senxi; Farias, Albert J",Medical care,3,0

This is possibly because many interventions for child mental health lie outside the realm of narrowly defined biomedical interventions and platforms, with the majority of interventions targeting psychological and social mechanisms and a strong emphasis on prevention. This situation must change, however, as child mental health interventions have potentially the greatest impact on the burden of mental disorders, and other health and social outcomes, than at any other time in the life course. There is now a growing body of evidence that indicates which interventions are ready for scale-up or show sufficient promise for further research and refinement. These are primarily delivered in community or school platforms through nonspecialist workers in partnership with parents and teachers. They include interventions to promote early child development, parenting interventions through childhood into adolescence, school interventions aimed at reengineering school environments and strengthening life skills, and interventions for the early detection and management of neurodevelopmental disorders and mental health problems through trans-diagnostic interventions based on impairments. Above all, what is needed is a population-based approach, which emphasizes the goal of coverage of evidence-based interventions for all children; with a particular focus on disadvantaged children; with seamless coordination of preventive and treatment interventions across platforms of care; and utilizing collaborative, stepped-care delivery paradigms.","Patel, Vikram; Rahman, Atif",Child and adolescent mental health,3,1

This study aimed to define whether these technical difficulties affect the surgical outcome. METHODS A total of 220 patients underwent laparoscopic liver resection during 244 procedures from August 1998 to December 2010. The patients who underwent primary minor single liver resection for malignant tumors affecting either posterosuperior segments 1, 7, 8, and, 4a (group 1) or anterolateral segments 2, 3, 5, 6, and 4b (group 2) were included in the study. Seventy-five procedures found to be eligible for the study, including 28 patients in group 1 and 47 patients in group 2. Intraoperative unfavorable incidents were graded on the basis of the Satava approach and postoperative complications were graded in agreement with the Accordion classification. RESULTS The operative time (median, 127 min) and blood loss (median, 200 ml) were equivalent in the two groups. The rates for blood transfusions and intraoperative accidents did not differ statistically between the groups. A tumor-free margin resection was achieved in 94.7% of the procedures, equivalently in both groups. The postoperative course was similar in the two groups. Postoperative complications developed in 2 cases (7.1%) in group 1 and 2 cases (4.3%) in group 2 (p = 0.626). The median hospital stay was 2 days in both groups. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic liver resection for lesions located in posterosuperior segments represents certain technical challenges. However, appropriate adjustment of surgical techniques and optimal patient positioning enables the laparoscopic technique to provide safe and effective parenchyma-sparing resections for lesions located in both posterosuperior and anterolateral segments.","Kazaryan, Airazat M; Røsok, Bård I; Marangos, Irina Pavlik; Rosseland, Arne R; Edwin, Bjørn",Surgical endoscopy,3,32

We have studied the effects of two bariatric procedures on type 2 diabetes and on gastrointestinal hormone secretion in a lean diabetic animal model. METHODS Male Goto-Kakizaki rats, 17-18 weeks old, were randomized into three groups: duodenojejunostomy (DJ), sleeve gastrectomy (SG), or sham operation. During 36 postoperative weeks we evaluated body weight, fasting blood glucose, glucose tolerance, insulin, HbA1c, glucagon-like peptide 1, cholesterol parameters, triglycerides, total ghrelin, and gastrin. RESULTS Oral glucose tolerance was significantly improved for both DJ and SG at four weeks after surgery (p < 0.05). At the 34th postoperative week, SG had significantly lower area under the curve during oral glucose tolerance test compared to sham (p = 0.007). SG had significantly lower HbA1c compared to sham at 12 weeks; (mean ± SEM) 4.3 ± 0.1 % versus 5.2 ± 0.3 % (p < 0.05) and compared to both DJ and sham 34 weeks after surgery [median (75 %;25 %)] 5.2 (6.0; 4.3) % versus 7.0 (7.5; 6.7) % and 7.3 (7.6; 6.7) % (p = 0.009). Serum gastrin levels were markedly elevated for SG compared to DJ and sham; 188.0 (318.0; 121.0) versus 77.5 (114.0; 58.0) and 68.0 (90.0; 59.5) pmol/L (p = 0.004) at six weeks and 192.0 (587.8; 110.8) versus 65.5 (77.0; 59.0) and 69.5 (113.0; 55.5) (p = 0.001) 36 weeks after surgery. CONCLUSION Sleeve gastrectomy induces hypergastrinemia, lowers HbA1c, and improves glycemic control in Goto-Kakizaki rats. Sleeve gastrectomy is superior to duodenojejunostomy as treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in this animal model.","Grong, Eivind; Arbo, Ingerid Brænne; Thu, Ole Kristian Forstrønen; Kuhry, Esther; Kulseng, Bård; Mårvik, Ronald",Surgical endoscopy,3,17

Since traditional sedatives carry the risk of respiratory depression, this retrospective study was designed to compare sedation with the α2 adrenergic agonist dexmedetomidine (DEX) and with GA for IAT procedures. METHODS We reviewed our institutional endovascular database of 216 consecutive patients who received DEX or GA for IAT of anterior circulation strokes between September 2010 and July 2012. The demographic, radiographic and angiographic variables between the GA and DEX groups were compared, as well as hemodynamic changes during the procedure. Binary logistic regression models were generated to determine the independent predictors of a favorable outcome (defined as a modified Rankin Score at 90 days of 0-2). RESULTS 83 patients had IAT performed under DEX sedation. Their demographic characteristics were similar to those given GA except that they were older and had less severe strokes. The GA group experienced greater variations in blood pressure, more hypotension with induction (54% vs 28%, p<0.001) and greater use of vasopressors (79% vs 58%, p<0.001). In our regression models, independent predictors of a good outcome included age, NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, Alberta Stroke Program Early CT score (ASPECTS), successful reperfusion, lower baseline systolic blood pressure and higher blood pressures during the procedure. DEX was associated with a good outcome when models included NIHSS as the sole measure of stroke severity but was equivalent to GA when ASPECTS was added to the analysis. CONCLUSIONS DEX can be safely administered in patients undergoing endovascular reperfusion therapies. Further study is required to determine if outcomes are different among sedatives used during such procedures.","Whalin, Matthew K; Lopian, Susan; Wyatt, Katleen; Sun, Chung-Huan J; Nogueira, Raul G; Glenn, Brenda A; Gershon, Raphael Y; Gupta, Rishi",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,3,1

METHODS We conducted a retrospective chart review of all outpatient medical abortions from October 2016 through December 2019 at our academic medical centre in Portland, Oregon, USA. Using mifepristone administration logs, we identified patients who underwent abortion via direct-to-patient telemedicine or in clinic. Both groups had pre-abortion ultrasound examination. We extracted patient characteristics and geographic data to compare travel distance to clinic, ultrasound facility, and nearest advertised abortion clinic. We compared time from first contact until mifepristone ingestion and gestational age at mifepristone ingestion. RESULTS Median distance from mailing address to clinic for 80 telemedicine and 124 clinic medical abortions was 95 (range 4-377) and 12 (range 0-184) miles (p<0.01). Distance travelled to ultrasound facility was shorter for telemedicine patients (median 7 miles, range 0-150 vs 12 miles, range 0-184; p<0.01) excluding outliers >200 miles. Distance to nearest advertised abortion clinic was equal between groups (median 7 miles, p=0.4). Time to mifepristone administration (ingestion) was longer (11 vs 6 days; p<0.01) and median gestational age was higher (49 vs 44 days; p=0.01) for telemedicine. CONCLUSIONS Telemedicine increases the reach of abortion providers and provides care to more geographically distant patients. Patients chose telemedicine abortion even when they had an equidistant option, suggesting that patients value telemedicine for reasons other than geographic convenience. This telemedicine delivery model that included ultrasound testing prior to abortion resulted in up to a 5-day delay in abortion initiation, which was not clinically significant.","Beardsworth, Kathleen Marie; Doshi, Uma; Raymond, Elizabeth; Baldwin, Maureen K",BMJ sexual & reproductive health,3,10

OBJECTIVES To investigate if cerebral (rScO2) and renal (rSrO2) tissue oxygen saturation 30 min after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) are different between surviving versus nonsurviving piglets with asphyxia-induced cardiac arrest and CPR. Further, to investigate the relationship of rScO2 and rSrO2 to cardiac output (CO), blood pressure (BP), and biochemical variables 30 min and 4 h after ROSC. METHODS Anesthetized, mechanically ventilated piglets (1-3 days, 1.7-2.4 kg) were used. rScO2, rSrO2, SpO2, right common carotid artery flow, and arterial BP were measured continuously. CO was measured with echocardiography. The piglets were asphyxiated until cardiac arrest and resuscitated. Piglets that survived 4 h after ROSC (n = 12) were compared with piglets that died before planned euthanasia at 4 h (n = 13). Left ventricular, and kidney and brain tissue lactate were analyzed. Correlations between variables were assessed. RESULTS Thirty minutes after ROSC, median rSrO2 (43% [n = 10] vs. 25% [n = 2], p = 0.003) but not rScO2 (46% [41-55] [n = 10] vs. 40% [22-45] [n = 5], p = 0.08) was higher in survivors than in nonsurvivors. Arterial lactate was negatively correlated and pH positively correlated with rScO2 and rSrO2. Left ventricular, but not kidney or brain lactate was negatively correlated with rScO2 and rSrO2. There was no correlation between CO or BP and rScO2 or rSrO2. CONCLUSIONS Despite satisfactory CO and BP vital organ oxygenation can be poor. Tissue oxygen saturation, pH, and lactate, as measures of anaerobic metabolism, may reflect vital organ oxygenation and outcome.","Solevåg, Anne Lee; Schmölzer, Georg M; Nakstad, Britt; Saugstad, Ola Didrik; Cheung, Po-Yin",Neonatology,3,31

This research uses the case of employees at two international universities in Thailand that have been directly affected by the COVID-19 crisis. Grounded in social support theory and the job-demand resource model of job stress, this research examines the role of supervisor support in explaining the degree of perceived uncertainties and emotional exhaustion that employees experience due to the COVID-19 crisis. Moreover, this research examines whether the effect of supervisor support on the perceived uncertainties of employees can be moderated by organizational intransigence, that is, a prevailing climate of resistance to change at the workplace. The questionnaire survey data were obtained from a sample of 300 employees at two private international universities, and the partial least squares structural equation model was used for data analysis. The results significantly confirm that supervisor support has a negative effect on the perceived uncertainties of employees. Perceived uncertainties also significantly mediate the negative effect of supervisor support on the employees' emotional exhaustion. More importantly, the moderating effect analysis shows that the negative effect of supervisor support on the perceived uncertainties of employees presents only for employees who work in a workplace climate where there is low intransigence; in a workplace climate where there is high intransigence, supervisor support does not lower the perceived uncertainties of employees.","Charoensukmongkol, Peerayuth; Phungsoonthorn, Tipnuch",The Journal of general psychology,3,24

The present study surveyed top problems experienced by adolescents and young adults (A/YAs) with ADHD during the COVID-19 pandemic to identify possible reasons for symptom escalation and potential targets for intervention. We also explored perceived benefits of the pandemic for A/YAs with ADHD. METHOD At the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic (April-June 2020), we administered self and parent ratings about current and pre-pandemic top problem severity and benefits of the pandemic to a sample of convenience (N = 134 A/YAs with ADHD participating in a prospective longitudinal study). RESULTS The most common top problems reported in the sample were social isolation (parent-report: 26.7%; self-report: 41.5%), difficulties engaging in online learning (parent-report: 23.3%, self-report: 20.3%), motivation problems (parent-report: 27.9%), and boredom (self-report: 21.3%). According to parent (d = 0.98) and self-report (d = 1.33), these top problems were more severe during the pandemic than in prior months. Contrary to previous speculation, there was no evidence that pandemic-related changes mitigated ADHD severity. Multi-level models indicated that A/YAs with higher IQs experienced severer top problems exacerbations at the transition to the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS For A/YAs with ADHD, several risk factors for depression and school dropout were incurred during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. A/YAs with ADHD should be monitored for school disengagement and depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. Recommended interventions attend to reducing risk factors such as increasing social interaction, academic motivation, and behavioral activation among A/YAs with ADHD.","Sibley, Margaret H; Ortiz, Mercedes; Gaias, Larissa M; Reyes, Rosemary; Joshi, Mahima; Alexander, Dana; Graziano, Paulo",Journal of psychiatric research,3,13

Four subtypes of this syndrome have been identified, which are clinically and genetically different. To date, altogether 32 patients have been described with ATP8A2 mutations and phenotypic features assigned to CAMRQ type 4. Herein, three additional patients in an Iranian consanguineous family with non-progressive cerebellar ataxia, severe hypotonia, intellectual disability, dysarthria, and cerebellar atrophy have been identified. METHODS Following the thorough clinical examination, consecutive detections including chromosome karyotyping, chromosomal microarray analysis, and whole exome sequencing (WES) were performed on the proband. The sequence variants derived from WES interpreted by a standard bioinformatics pipeline. Pathogenicity assessment of candidate variant was done by in silico analysis. The familial cosegregation of the WES finding was carried out by PCR-based Sanger sequencing. RESULTS A novel homozygous missense variant (c.1339G > A, p.Gly447Arg) in the ATP8A2 gene was identified and completely segregated with the phenotype in the family. In silico analysis and structural modeling revealed that the p.G477R substitution is deleterious and induced undesired effects on the protein stability and residue distribution in the ligand-binding pocket. The novel sequence variant occurred within an extremely conserved subregion of the ATP-binding domain. CONCLUSION Our findings expand the spectrum of ATP8A2 mutations and confirm the reported genotype-phenotype correlation. These results could improve genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis in families with clinical presentations related to CAMRQ4 syndrome.","Mohamadian, Malihe; Ghandil, Pegah; Naseri, Mohsen; Bahrami, Afsane; Momen, Ali Akbar",Journal of clinical laboratory analysis,3,20

DESIGN Retrospective review of Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation data collected from routine clinical care. SETTING Forty-three hospitals contributing coronavirus disease 2019 patient data between March 14, and June 17, 2020, and 132 hospitals in the United States contributing data on viral pneumonia patients to the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation database between January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2019. PATIENTS AND MEASUREMENTS One thousand four hundred ninety-one patients with diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 infection and 4,200 patients with a primary (n = 2,544) or secondary (n = 1,656) admitting diagnosis of noncoronavirus disease viral pneumonia receiving ICU care. A subset of 202 viral pneumonia patients with concurrent acute respiratory distress syndrome was examined separately. INTERVENTIONS None. MAIN RESULTS Mean age was 63.4 for coronavirus disease (p = 0.064) versus 64.1 for viral pneumonia. Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation-IV scores were similar at 56.7 and 55.0, respectively (p = 0.060), but gender and ethnic distributions differed, as did PaO2 to FIO2 ratio and WBC count at admission. The hospital standardized mortality ratio (95% CI) was 1.52 (1.35-1.68) for coronavirus disease patients and 0.82 (0.75-0.90) for viral pneumonia patients. In the coronavirus disease group, ICU and hospital length of stay were 3.1 and 3.0 days longer than in viral pneumonia patients. Standardized ICU and hospital length of stay ratios were 1.13 and 1.46 in the coronavirus disease group versus 0.95 and 0.94 in viral pneumonia patients. Forty-seven percent of coronavirus disease patients received invasive or noninvasive ventilatory support on their first ICU day versus 65% with viral pneumonia. Ventilator days in survivors were longer in coronavirus disease (10.4 d) than in viral pneumonia (4.3 d) patients, except in the viral pneumonia-acute respiratory distress syndrome subgroup (10.2 d) CONCLUSIONS:: Severity-adjusted mortality and length of stay are higher for coronavirus disease 2019 patients than for viral pneumonia patients admitted to ICU. Coronavirus disease patients also have longer time on ventilator and ICU length of stay, comparable with the subset of viral pneumonia patients with concurrent acute respiratory distress syndrome. Mortality and length of stay increase with age and higher scores in both populations, but observed to predicted mortality and length of stay are higher than expected with coronavirus disease patients across all severity of illness levels. These findings have implications for benchmarking ICU outcomes during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.","Higgins, Thomas L; Stark, Maureen M; Henson, Kathy N; Freeseman-Freeman, Laura",Critical care medicine,3,8

However, late-onset empyemas are not infrequent and may be difficult to diagnose and manage. PATIENTS AND METHODS From 1995 to 2008, 15 patients were referred to our department for an empyema that occurred between four months and 16years following a pneumonectomy (mean is equal to four years). We more particularly reviewed the mode of occurrence, the possible causes and the management of those late infections. RESULTS Presentation and characteristics were miscellaneous and delay in diagnosis was generally the rule. Two tendencies were emerging according to the delay of occurrence. During the first year following the pneumonectomy, the patients (n=8) had often received an adjuvant treatment (radiation therapy: n=2; radiation and chemotherapy: n=1; chemotherapy: n=2), often presented a bronchial fistula (n=5), and post-management morbidity (two deaths). After the first year, the patients (n=7) were without bronchial fistula, had rarely received an adjuvant therapy (n=1), and were rather suffering multiple associated diseases (n=3), or a bacteremia (n=3), and the treatments were more rapidly efficient. CONCLUSION Empyema is among the first diagnoses to think about in case of fever occurring late after pneumonectomy. Early diagnosis may permit more rapid management and hence, easier and better recovery.","Badia, A; Le Pimpec-Barthes, F; Bagan, P; Jamal, W; Riquet, M",Revue de pneumologie clinique,3,31

S. aureus was detected more frequently in tampons that did not require an applicator for their insertion (74/233 [32%] versus 90/381 [24%]; OR=1.51 [95% CI 1.04-2.17]) and in women who used an intrauterine device for contraception (53/155 [34%] versus 145/572 [27%]; OR =1.53 [95% CI 1.05-2.24]). The S. aureus strains isolated from tampons belonged to 22 different clonal complexes (CCs). The most prevalent CC was CC398 agr1 (n=57, 27%), a clone that does not produce superantigenic toxins, followed by CC30 agr 3 (n=27, 13%) producing TSST-1 (24/27 [89%]), the principal clone of S. aureus involved in menstrual toxic shock syndrome.IMPORTANCE Menstrual toxic shock syndrome (MTSS) is an uncommon severe acute disease that occurs in healthy menstruating women colonized by TSST-1-producing S. aureus who use intravaginal protection, such as tampons and menstrual cups. The catamenial product collected by the protection serves as a growth medium for S. aureus and allows TSST-1 production. Previous studies evaluated the prevalence of genital colonization by S. aureus by vaginal swabbing, but they did not examine tampon colonization. This study demonstrates a high prevalence of tampon colonization by S. aureus, and the presence of the CC30 TSST-1 S. aureus clone responsible for MTSS in tampons from healthy women. The results support the vaginal carriage of this lineage in healthy women. In addition, the higher prevalence of S. aureus within tampons that do not require an applicator indicates a crucial role of hand-washing before tampon handling to decrease the risk of tampon contamination.","Chiaruzzi, Myriam; Barbry, Alexia; Muggeo, Anaëlle; Tristan, Anne; Jacquemond, Isaline; Badiou, Cedric; Cluzeau, Laurence; Bourdeau, Sabine; Durand, Thibaut; Engelmann, Astrid; Bosquet, Dorian; Bes, Michèle; Prigent-Combaret, Claire; Thioulouse, Jean; Muller, Daniel; Lina, Gérard",Applied and environmental microbiology,3,1

Successful recanalisation (modified treatment in cerebral ischaemia scale 2b-3) was achieved in 20 patients (90.9%). A favourable clinical outcome (modified Rankin scale score 0-2) was observed in nine patients (40.9%) and the overall mortality rate was 40.9% (nine patients). Haemorrhagic events were observed in three patients (13.63%). A decreased level of consciousness requiring intubation in the acute setting was more frequent in patients with poor outcomes (84.6%) than in patients with favourable outcomes (11.1%), and in patients who died (100%) compared with those who survived (23.1%), with a statistically significant difference (P = 0.002 and P = 0.001, respectively). CONCLUSION Mechanical thrombectomy is feasible and effective in patients with acute basilar artery occlusion. A decreased level of consciousness requiring tracheal intubation seems to be a prognostic factor and is associated with a poor clinical outcome and higher mortality rate. These initial results must be confirmed by further prospective studies with a larger number of patients.","Werner, Mariano; Lopez-Rueda, Antonio; Zarco, Federico; Román, Luis San; Blasco, Jordi; Amaro, Sergio; Carrero, Enrique; Fontanals, Jaume; Oleaga, Laura; Macho, Juan; Bargallo, Nuria","Interventional neuroradiology : journal of peritherapeutic neuroradiology, surgical procedures and related neurosciences",3,19

The role of e-healthcare for the management of patients with lung diseases is evolving. We report the results of the initial experience of the SmartDoc Project, a telemedicine program activated in a cancer center (Istituto Nazionale Tumori) at the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic onset in Italy. METHOD The SmartDoc project was established to guarantee continuity of healthcare services for patients with lung cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic crisis. The project was promoted within the National Health System to create a regulatory framework to authorize and reimburse telemedicine in its care delivery for all patients. At the end of the virtual meeting, patients were asked to answer an online survey. RESULTS From June 19 to December 1, 2020, 83 patients participated in the SmartDoc project and received a teleconsultation. The majority of patients were older than 65 years. Among the 83 televisits, 14 (16.9%) were new visits, 2 (2.4%) second opinions, 4 (4.8%) 30-day postsurgery controls, and 63 (75.9%) long-term follow-up visits. A ""complete satisfaction"" score (5 out of 5 points) was reported in 70.59% of all the respondents; most patients (76.5%) preferred video-consulting and defined it as better than or comparable to an in-person visit. CONCLUSION The favorable initial results of this study suggest that telemedicine should continue beyond the pandemic crisis and should be embedded in a more efficient and accessible healthcare system.","Pardolesi, Alessandro; Lorenzo, Gherzi; Pastorino, Ugo",Tumori,3,20

The UPR is comprised of three signaling pathways activated downstream of the ER membrane proteins IRE1, ATF6, and PERK. Once activated, these proteins initiate transcriptional and translational signaling that functions to alleviate ER stress, adapt cellular physiology, and dictate cell fate. Imbalances in UPR signaling are implicated in the pathogenesis of numerous, etiologically-diverse diseases including many neurodegenerative diseases, protein misfolding diseases, diabetes, ischemic disorders, and cancer. This has led to significant interest in establishing pharmacologic strategies to selectively modulate IRE1, ATF6, or PERK signaling to both ameliorate pathologic imbalances in UPR signaling implicated in these different diseases, and to define the importance of the UPR in diverse cellular and organismal contexts. Recently, there has been significant progress in the identification and characterization of UPR modulating compounds, providing new opportunities to probe the pathologic and potentially therapeutic implications of UPR signaling in human disease. Here, we describe currently available UPR modulating compounds, specifically highlighting the strategies used for their discovery and specific advantages and disadvantages in their application for probing UPR function. Furthermore, we discuss lessons learned from the application of these compounds in cellular and in vivo models to identify favorable compound properties that can help drive the further translational development of selective UPR modulators for human disease.","Grandjean, Julia M D; Wiseman, R Luke",The Journal of biological chemistry,3,5

STUDY DESIGN In this prospective observational study, 22 preterm infants (gestational age 25.9 ± 1.2 weeks; range 23-27 weeks) were monitored between 4 and 76 hours after birth. Cardiac function and changes in CBF and P/IVH were assessed by ultrasound every 12 hours. Changes in CBF were also followed by continuous monitoring of cerebral regional oxygen saturation (rSO2) and by calculating cerebral fractional oxygen extraction. RESULTS Five patients developed P/IVH (1 patient grade II and 4 patients grade IV). Whereas measures of cardiac function and CBF remained unchanged in neonates without P/IVH, patients with P/IVH tended to have lower left ventricular output and had lower left ventricle stroke volume and cerebral rSO2 and higher cerebral fractional oxygen extraction during the first 12 hours of the study. By 28 hours, these variables were similar in the 2 groups and myocardial performance index was lower and middle cerebral artery mean flow velocity higher in the P/IVH group. P/IVH was detected after these changes occurred. CONCLUSIONS Cardiac function and CBF remain stable in very preterm neonates who do not develop P/IVH during the first 3 postnatal days. In very preterm neonates developing P/IVH during this period, lower systemic perfusion and CBF followed by an increase in these variables precede the development of P/IVH. Monitoring cardiac function and cerebral rSO2 may identify infants at higher risk for developing P/IVH before the bleeding occurs.","Noori, Shahab; McCoy, Michael; Anderson, Michael P; Ramji, Faridali; Seri, Istvan",The Journal of pediatrics,3,1

Due to its nature, the SOFA score often has missing data. How much data is missing and how that missing data is handled is unknown. Objectives We conducted a scoping review on cardiac arrest studies using SOFA, focusing on missing data. Data sources PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science. Study selection All English-language peer-reviewed studies of cardiac arrest with SOFA as an outcome or exposure were included. Data extraction For each study, quantity of missing SOFA data, analytic strategy to handle missing SOFA variables, whether/to what degree mortality influenced the amount of missing SOFA scores), SOFA score modifications, and number of SOFA measurements was extracted. Data synthesis We included 66 studies published between 2006-2019. Five studies were randomized controlled trials, 26 were prospective cohort studies, and 25 were retrospective cohort studies. SOFA was used as an outcome in 36 (55%) and a primary outcome in 10 (15%). Nine studies (14%) mentioned the quantity of missing SOFA data, which ranged from 0 to 76% (median: 10% [IQR: 6%, 42%]). Twenty-seven (41%) studies reported a method to handle missing SOFA. The most common method used excluded subjects with missing data (81%). In the 50 studies using serial SOFA scores, 11 (22%) documented mortality prior to SOFA measurement; which ranged from 3% to 76% (median: 12% [IQR: 6%-35%]). Conclusions Missing data is common in cardiac arrest research using SOFA scores.

The present study is concerned with the genetic discrimination of fifteen alfalfa cultivars from three different countries (Egypt, Australia, and USA) using two molecular approaches: inter-retrotransposon-amplified polymorphism (IRAP) markers and two chloroplast DNA barcodes matK and the trnH in addition to the analysis of fifteen morpho-agronomic traits. The genetic relatedness, based on analysis of IRAP marker polymorphism and produced using eleven primers by clustering via principal component analysis (PCA) and multivariate heatmap biostatistical methods differentiated the two Egyptian cultivars EGY1-Ismailia1 and EGY2-Nubaria1 from the three Australian and seven American cultivars, with some distinction of the cv. USA6-SW9720 and cv. AUS4-SuperFast. The results were also supported by the sequence analysis of the matK and the trnH genes on the genetic relatedness between eight cultivars. Moreover, it might be suggested that breeding lines from M. sativa cultivars may provide novel insights and a better understanding of the domestication of M. sativa genetic diversity. The classification of the eight cultivars, as revealed by morpho-agronomic traits, confirmed the close genetic relationship between the two Egyptian cultivars and indicated some resemblance between them and the AUS2-Siri Nafa, whereas the two American cultivars, USA1-Super supreme and USA4-Cuf101, were clearly isolated from a cluster of other three cultivars USA7-SW9628, USA8-Magna901, and USA9-Perfect. The results are useful sources of genetic information for future breeding programs in crop development and open new possibilities of producing M. sativa lines harboring high forage quality, productivity, and resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses.","Badr, Abdelfattah; El-Sherif, Nahla; Aly, Sara; Ibrahim, Shafik D; Ibrahim, Mohamed",Plants,3,27

Nonstructural protein 2 (nsP2) exhibits the protease and RNA helicase activities that are required for viral RNA replication and transcription. Unlike for the C-terminal protease, the structure of the N-terminal RNA helicase (nsP2h) has not been determined. Here, we report the crystal structure of the nsP2h bound to the conserved 3'-end 14 nucleotides of the CHIKV genome and the nonhydrolyzable transition-state nucleotide analog ADP-AlF4 Overall, the structural analysis revealed that nsP2h adopts a uniquely folded N-terminal domain followed by a superfamily 1 RNA helicase fold. The conserved helicase motifs establish polar contacts with the RNA backbone. There are three hydrophobic residues (Y161, F164, and F287) which form stacking interactions with RNA bases and thereby bend the RNA backbone. An F287A substitution that disrupted these stacking interactions increased the basal ATPase activity but decreased the RNA binding affinity. Furthermore, the F287A substitution reduced viral infectivity by attenuating subgenomic RNA synthesis. Replication of the mutant virus was restored by pseudoreversion (A287V) or adaptive mutations in the RecA2 helicase domain (T358S or V410I). Y161A and/or F164A substitutions, which were designed to disrupt the interactions with the RNA molecule, did not affect the ATPase activity but completely abolished the replication and transcription of viral RNA and the infectivity of CHIKV. Our study sheds light on the roles of the RNA helicase region in viral replication and provides insights that might be applicable to alphaviruses and other RNA viruses in general.","Law, Yee-Song; Utt, Age; Tan, Yaw Bia; Zheng, Jie; Wang, Sainan; Chen, Ming Wei; Griffin, Patrick R; Merits, Andres; Luo, Dahai",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,3,20

Research from past decades has suggested minimum open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (OAAA) volume requirements for surgeons (9-13 OAAA/year) and hospitals (18 OAAA/year) to purportedly achieve acceptable results. Given concerns regarding the decreased frequency of open repairs in the endovascular era, we examined the association of surgeon and hospital volume with 30- and 90-day mortality in the Vascular Quality Initiative (VQI) registry. METHODS Patients who underwent elective OAAA repair between 2013-2018 were identified in the VQI registry. We cross-sectionally evaluated the association of average hospital and surgeon volume with 30-day postoperative mortality using a hierarchical Bayesian model. Cross-level interaction was permitted and random surgeon- and hospital-level intercepts were used to account for clustering. Mortality results were adjusted by standardizing to the observed distribution of relevant covariates in the overall cohort. Outcomes were compared to the Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) guidelines recommended criteria of <5% perioperative mortality. RESULTS 3,078 patients underwent elective OAAA repair by 520 surgeons at 128 hospitals. The 30- and 90-day risks of postoperative mortality were 4.1% (n=126) and 5.4% (n=166), respectively. Mean surgeon volume and hospital volume were both inversely correlated with 30-day mortality. Averaged across all patients and hospitals, there was a 96% probability that surgeons who performed an average of ≥4 repairs per year achieved <5% 30-day mortality. There was substantial interplay between surgeon volume and hospital volume. For example, at lower volume hospitals performing an average of 5 repairs per year, <5% 30-day mortality would be expected 69% of the time for surgeons performing an average of 3 operations per year. Conversely, at higher volume hospitals performing an average of 40 repairs per year, a <5% 30-day mortality would be expected 96% of the time by surgeons performing an average 3 operations annually. As hospital volume increased, there was diminishing difference in 30-day mortality between lower and higher volume surgeons. Likewise, as surgeon volume increased, there was diminishing difference in 30-day mortality between lower and higher volume hospitals. CONCLUSIONS Surgeons and hospitals in the VQI registry achieved mortality outcomes below 5% (SVS guidelines) with an average surgeon volume that was substantially lower compared with previous reports. Further, when considering minimal surgeon volume guidelines, it is important to contextualize outcomes within hospital volumes.","Sharma, Gaurav; Madenci, Arin L; Wanis, Kerollos Nashat; Comment, Leah A; Lotto, Christine E; Shah, Samir K; Ozaki, C Keith; Subramanian, S V; Eldrup-Jorgensen, Jens; Belkin, Michael",Journal of vascular surgery,3,1

This study sought to (1) identify key features of preparedness and the primary concerns of local public health officials in deciding to implement social distancing measures and (2) determine whether any particular factor could explain the widespread variation among health departments in responses to past outbreaks. METHODS We conducted an online survey of health departments in the United States in 2015 to understand factors influencing health departments' decision making when choosing whether to implement social distancing measures. We paired survey results with data on area population demographic characteristics and analyzed them with a focus on broad trends. RESULTS Of 600 health departments contacted, 150 (25%) responded. Of these 150 health departments, 63 (42%) indicated that they had implemented social distancing in the past 10 years. Only 10 (7%) health departments had a line-item budget for isolation or quarantine. The most common concern about social distancing was public health impact (n = 62, 41%). Concerns about law, politics, finances, vulnerable populations, and sociocultural issues were each identified by 7% to 10% of health departments. We were unable to clearly predict which factors would influence these decisions. CONCLUSIONS Variations in the decision to implement social distancing are likely the result of differences in organizational authority and resources and in the primary concerns about implementing social distancing. Research and current social distancing guidelines for health departments should address these factors.","Katz, Rebecca; Vaught, Andrea; Simmens, Samuel J",Public health reports,3,31

Methods : A total of 35 COVID-2019 patients were included in this cross-sectional case series study. Throat samples from all enrolled patients were collected with sampling swab, and simultaneously, tear samples were collected with sampling swab from 9 patients (No.1-9) and with Schirmer's strip from the remaining patients (No.10-35) (bilateral eyes for all patients). Sample collecting and testing were performed in three separate time points: first from patients No.1-9, second from patients No.10-29, and third from patients No. 30-35. Reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay was performed. Results : Among enrolled patients, 29 (No.1-29) had mild or moderate clinical symptoms and 6 (No.30-35) had severe symptoms. The mean time interval from the sample collection day to diagnosis confirmation day was 9.71 ± 6.50 days (ranged from 3 to 29 days). None of the patients had conjunctivitis. Nineteen out of 35 (54.3%) throat samples presented positive Rt-PCR results. Three (no.13,21,31) out of 35 (8.6%) tear samples presented positive RT-PCR results. Two (no.21, 31) of these three patients were throat swab positive and one (No. 13) was negative. The consistency analysis indicated that tears and throat samples showed poor consistency (Kappa = -0.009, P = .9).The cycle threshold value (Ct-value) of tear samples collected by sampling swab was significantly higher than that by Schirmer's strip (t = 2.288, P = .03). Conclusion : In spite of the low SARS-CoV-2 positive detection rate of tear samples from COVID-2019 patients, we cannot fully rule out the transmission by ocular surface. Whether tear testing can be used as an aid in judging of SARS-CoV-2 infection need further investigation.","Yan, Ying; Zeng, Bo; Zhang, Zhang; Hu, Cheng; Yan, Ming; Li, Bixi; Zhang, Xiaopeng; Chen, Xiao",Ophthalmic epidemiology,3,1

Rituximab radiolabeled with β(-) emitters could potentiate the therapeutic efficacy of the antibody by virtue of the particle radiation. Here, we report on a direct radiolabeling approach of rituximab with the (99m)Tc- and (188)Re-tricarbonyl core (IsoLink technology). METHODS The native format of the antibody (RTX(wt)) as well as a reduced form (RTX(red)) was labeled with (99m)Tc/(188)Re(CO)(3). The partial reduction of the disulfide bonds to produce free sulfhydryl groups (-SH) was achieved with 2-mercaptoethanol. Radiolabeling efficiency, in vitro human plasma stability as well as transchelation toward cysteine and histidine was investigated. The immunoreactivity and binding affinity were determined on Ramos and/or Raji cells expressing CD20. Biodistribution was performed in mice bearing subcutaneous Ramos lymphoma xenografts. RESULTS The radiolabeling efficiency and kinetics of RTX(red) were superior to that of RTX(wt) ((99m)Tc: 98% after 3 h for RTX(red) vs. 70% after 24 h for RTX(wt)). (99m)Tc(CO)(3)-RTX(red) was used without purification for in vitro and in vivo studies whereas (188)Re(CO)(3)-RTX(red) was purified to eliminate free (188)Re-precursor. Both radioimmunoconjugates were stable in human plasma for 24 h at 37 °C. In contrast, displacement experiments with excess cysteine/histidine showed significant transchelation in the case of (99m)Tc(CO)(3)-RTX(red) but not with pre-purified (188)Re(CO)(3)-RTX(red). Both conjugates revealed high binding affinity to the CD20 antigen (K(d) = 5-6 nM). Tumor uptake of (188)Re(CO)(3)-RTX(red) was 2.5 %ID/g and 0.8 %ID/g for (99m)Tc(CO)(3)-RTX(red) 48 h after injection. The values for other organs and tissues were similar for both compounds, for example the tumor-to-blood and tumor-to-liver ratios were 0.4 and 0.3 for (99m)Tc(CO)(3)-RTX(red) and for (188)Re(CO)(3)-RTX(red) 0.5 and 0.5 (24 h pi). CONCLUSION Rituximab could be directly and stably labeled with the matched pair (99m)Tc/(188)Re using the IsoLink technology under retention of the biological activity. Labeling kinetics and yields need further improvement for potential routine application in radioimmunodiagnosis and therapy.","Dias, Carla Roberta; Jeger, Simone; Osso, João Alberto; Müller, Cristina; De Pasquale, Christine; Hohn, Alexander; Waibel, Robert; Schibli, Roger",Nuclear medicine and biology,3,22

METHODS A retrospective study was conducted on adult patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in our hospital. Diagnosis was based on a positive real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on nasopharyngeal samples. The cohort was divided into two groups, i.e. a favorable evolution (FE) group and an unfavorable evolution (UFE) group, including intensive care unit (ICU) and deceased patients. Results: A total of 198 patients were enrolled in the study, with 138 FE (70%) and 60 UFE (30%). Older age, male gender, comorbidities and dyspnea at admission constituted significantly worse prognosis factors. Among laboratory features, lymphocyte and platelet counts as well as corrected glomerular filtration rate were significantly lower in UFE patients, while neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, inflammation biomarkers, creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), glycemia and D-dimer were significantly higher. Procalcitonin and LDH appeared as the most accurate variables according to receiver operating characteristic curves. CONCLUSIONS This Belgian study revealed clinical and laboratory features able to predict high risk of ICU requirement, or even death, at admission time. These results provide a potential tool for patient's triage in a context of pandemic.

Many viruses use 5' caps or other mechanisms to mimic a cap structure to limit detection of viral RNAs by intracellular innate sensors and to direct efficient translation of viral proteins. The coronavirus (CoV) nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14) is a multifunctional protein with N7-methyltransferase (N7-MTase) activity. The highly conserved S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM)-binding residues of the DxG motif are required for nsp14 N7-MTase activity in vitro However, the requirement for CoV N7-MTase activity and the importance of the SAM-binding residues during viral replication have not been determined. Here, we engineered mutations in murine hepatitis virus (MHV) nsp14 N7-MTase at residues D330 and G332 and determined the effects of these mutations on viral replication, sensitivity to mutagen, inhibition by type I interferon (IFN), and translation efficiency. Virus encoding a G332A substitution in nsp14 displayed delayed replication kinetics and decreased peak titers relative to wild-type (WT) MHV. In addition, replication of nsp14 G332A virus was diminished following treatment of cells with IFN-β, and nsp14 G332A genomes were translated less efficiently both in vitro and during viral infection. In contrast, substitution of alanine at MHV nsp14 D330 did not affect viral replication, sensitivity to mutagen, or inhibition by IFN-β compared to WT MHV. Our results demonstrate that the conserved MHV N7-MTase SAM-binding-site residues are not required for MHV viability and suggest that the determinants of CoV N7-MTase activity differ in vitro and during virus infection. IMPORTANCE Human coronaviruses, most notably severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, cause severe and lethal human disease. Since specific antiviral therapies are not available for the treatment of human coronavirus infections, it is essential to understand the functions of conserved CoV proteins in viral replication. Here, we show that substitution of alanine at G332 in the N7-MTase domain of nsp14 impairs viral replication, enhances sensitivity to the innate immune response, and reduces viral RNA translation efficiency. Our data support the idea that coronavirus RNA capping could be targeted for development of antiviral therapeutics.","Case, James Brett; Ashbrook, Alison W; Dermody, Terence S; Denison, Mark R",Journal of virology,3,25

The objective of this review is to systematically examine current published literature on interventions designed to improve the psychosocial wellbeing of older adults living with HIV. A pre-specified search strategy was applied to four databases: PubMed, CINAHL Plus with Text, PsycINFO, and Health Source. Authors reviewed published studies on psychosocial interventions for older adults with HIV and reported psychosocial variables as primary outcomes of the interventions. The final review included nine intervention studies. Psychosocial outcomes measured across multiple studies included depression, quality of life, social support, cognitive functioning, and coping skills. Some studies also measured physical activity, HIV-related discrimination, lack of affordable housing, and access to substance abuse treatment. Our study suggests a paucity of psychosocial intervention research on adults aging with HIV. This review suggests that most psychosocial interventions had small to moderate effects in improving the psychosocial wellbeing of older people living with HIV. Findings highlight the need for clinical, community, and home-based interventions to ensure that individuals can achieve a higher quality of life while aging with HIV.","Bhochhibhoya, Amir; Harrison, Sayward; Yonce, Stephanie; Friedman, Daniela B; Ghimire, Pragya Sharma; Li, Xiaoming",AIDS care,3,31

Methods Six electronic databases were searched for studies published 1997-2020. Quantitative and qualitative studies were included if they investigated barriers or facilitators associated with RTW in people with minor to serious musculoskeletal RTI aged over 16 years. Methodological quality was assessed using McMaster Critical Review Form for Quantitative studies and McMaster Critical Review Form for Qualitative Studies. Results are presented narratively as meta-analysis was not possible. Results Eleven studies (10 quantitative and 1 qualitative) were included. There was strong evidence that individuals with higher overall scores on the (short-form or long-form) Örebro Musculoskeletal Pain Questionnaire (ÖMPQ) at baseline were less likely to RTW, and individuals with higher RTW expectancies at baseline were more likely to RTW after musculoskeletal RTI. There was weak evidence for higher disability levels and psychiatric history impeding RTW after musculoskeletal RTI. Conclusions Post-injury scores on the ÖMPQ and RTW expectancies are the most influential factors for RTW after minor to serious musculoskeletal RTI. There is a need to identify consistent measures of RTW to facilitate comparisons between studies.","Abedi, Masoumeh; Gane, Elise; Aplin, Tammy; Zerguine, Haroun; Johnston, Venerina",Journal of occupational rehabilitation,3,19

We explored how beliefs, perceptions and contextual factors influenced ICU clinicians' antibiotic prescribing. METHODS We conducted 4 focus groups and 34 semistructured interviews with clinicians involved in antibiotic prescribing in four English ICUs. Focus groups explored factors influencing prescribing, whereas interviews examined decision-making processes using two clinical vignettes. Data were analysed using thematic analysis, applying the Necessity Concerns Framework. RESULTS Clinicians' antibiotic decisions were influenced by their judgement of the necessity for prescribing/not prescribing, relative to their concerns about potential adverse consequences. Antibiotic necessity perceptions were strongly influenced by beliefs that antibiotics would protect patients from deterioration and themselves from the ethical and legal consequences of undertreatment. Clinicians also reported concerns about prescribing antibiotics. These generally centred on antimicrobial resistance; however, protecting the individual patient was prioritised over these societal concerns. Few participants identified antibiotic toxicity concerns as a key influencer. Clinical uncertainty often complicated balancing antibiotic necessity against concerns. Decisions to start or continue antibiotics often represented 'erring on the side of caution' as a protective response in uncertainty. This approach was reinforced by previous experiences of negative consequences ('being burnt') which motivated prescribing 'just in case' of an infection. Prescribing decisions were also context-dependent, exemplified by a lower perceived threshold to prescribe antibiotics out-of-hours, input from external team members and local prescribing norms. CONCLUSION Efforts to improve antibiotic stewardship should consider clinicians' desire to protect with a prescription. Rapid molecular microbiology, with appropriate communication, may diminish clinicians' fears of not prescribing or of using narrower-spectrum antibiotics.","Pandolfo, Alyssa M; Horne, Robert; Jani, Yogini; Reader, Tom W; Bidad, Natalie; Brealey, David; Enne, Virve I; Livermore, David M; Gant, Vanya; Brett, Stephen J",BMJ quality & safety,3,1

We present our institutional experience and progression using one such technique-off-clamp RAPN-as well as the results of this technique in the management of complex cases. PATIENTS AND METHODS A retrospective chart review of 65 patients undergoing off-clamp RAPN was performed, 15 of whom underwent off-clamp RAPN for 26 complex tumors. Complex features included hilar location, completely endophytic growth, and ipsilateral multifocality. In all cases, hilar vessels were dissected but not clamped. RESULTS Mean tumor size was 2.5 cm (standard deviation; [SD]=1.4), while mean nephrometry score was 8.7 (SD=1.5). One (7%) intraoperative complication occurred. Mean estimated blood loss was 403 mL (SD=381), mean operative time was 190 minutes (SD=68), and WIT was 0 minutes in all cases. Mean length of stay was 1.8 days (SD=0.9), with one patient needing a postoperative blood transfusion (Clavien II complication). Final pathology results demonstrated clear-cell carcinoma (n=16), papillary carcinoma (n=4), angiomyolipoma (n=1), oncocytoma (n=2), and cystic nephroma (n=3). Margins were negative for tumor for 96% (25/26) of resected masses. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decreased by an average of 3.1 mL/min/1.73 m(2) (SD=9.8, P=0.24), at a mean follow-up of 177 days (SD=296). Five patients with radiographic follow-up of at least 6 months have no evidence of disease recurrence. CONCLUSIONS Off-clamp RAPN can be safely and effectively performed even in the case of complex tumors, but occurs with higher estimated blood loss. Minimal changes in eGFR were experienced by patients undergoing off-clamp RAPN at an average follow-up of roughly 6 months. Longer follow-up and direct comparison with conventional clamped RAPN technique are needed to establish the efficacy of off-clamp RAPN in complex cases.","Kim, Eric H; Tanagho, Youssef S; Sandhu, Gurdarshan S; Bhayani, Sam B; Figenshau, R Sherburne",Journal of endourology,3,33

Although this typically involves recurrent incisional hernias, operative strategies can be applied to most abdominal wall defects, including chronic wounds with or without exposed mesh, enterocutaneous fistulas, or hernias associated with significant pannus formation. METHODS This is a retrospective review of a single institution/single surgeon experience of complex ventral hernia repair performed over a 5-year period. Patients were classified into different hernia types based on their characteristics and underwent hernia repair according to the presented algorithm. RESULTS A total of 133 patients underwent a complex ventral hernia repair between January 2005 and September 2009. The separation of components technique was used in the majority of cases. Permanent or biologic mesh was added in select patients. Adjunctive procedures were performed as indicated. The majority of short-term (less than 1 year) recurrences occurred in patients expected to have impaired wound healing due to comorbid conditions. In these patients, the recurrence rate was reduced when autologous repair was reinforced with mesh. CONCLUSION Autologous tissue is the preferred method for reconstruction of complex ventral hernias. In certain instances, such as contamination, use of an acellular dermal matrix mesh is added as a temporizing measure. A subset of patients who will be prone to recurrence remains. Long-term follow-up is needed to confirm reliable and reproducible results.","Hadeed, Josef G; Walsh, Mark D; Pappas, Theodore N; Pestana, Ivo A; Tyler, Douglas S; Levinson, Howard; Mantyh, Christopher; Jacobs, Danny O; Lagoo-Deenadalayan, Sandhya A; Erdmann, Detlev",Annals of plastic surgery,3,1

These surveillance strategies include event-based surveillance (EBS) systems and risk modelling. The EBS systems use open-source internet data, such as media reports, official reports, and social media (such as Twitter) to detect evidence of an emerging threat, and can be used in conjunction with conventional surveillance systems to enhance early warning of public health threats. More recently, EBS systems include artificial intelligence applications such machine learning and natural language processing to increase the speed, capacity and accuracy of filtering, classifying and analysing health-related internet data. Risk modelling uses statistical and mathematical methods to assess the severity of disease emergence and spread given factors about the host (e.g. number of reported cases), pathogen (e.g. pathogenicity) and environment (e.g. climate suitability for reservoir populations). The types of data in these models are expanding to include health-related information from open-source internet data and information on mobility patterns of humans and goods. This information is helping to identify susceptible populations and predict the pathways from which infections might spread into new areas and new countries. As a powerful addition to traditional surveillance strategies that identify what has already happened, it is anticipated that EBS systems and risk modelling will increasingly be used to inform public health actions to prevent, detect and mitigate the climate change increases in infectious diseases.","Rees, E E; Ng, V; Gachon, P; Mawudeku, A; McKenney, D; Pedlar, J; Yemshanov, D; Parmely, J; Knox, J",Canada communicable disease report = Releve des maladies transmissibles au Canada,3,30

Community-dwelling people with a SCI can prevent them with appropriate skin care (i.e. pressure relieving activities, skin checks). Adherence to skin care remains suboptimal however, and self-management interventions that focus on improving this have been designed. Little is known on their content, effectiveness, or theoretical basis. The aim of the proposed systematic review is to synthesize the literature on self-management interventions to improve skin care in people with a SCI. Specific objectives are to describe these interventions in relation to their content, effectiveness, theory base, and adherence to reporting guidelines for intervention description. METHODS The search strategy will combine an electronic search of nine bibliographic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, PsycInfo, CENTRAL, CINAHL, Rehabdata, CIRRIE, PEDro, ERIC) and two trial registers with a manual search of relevant reference lists. Predefined eligibility criteria will be applied in a two-phase selection process involving title and abstract screening, followed by full-text screening. A data extraction spreadsheet will be applied to included papers. Intervention content will be coded using two taxonomies (behaviour change taxonomy; PRISMS self-management support taxonomy). A validated tool (Theory Coding Scheme) and the Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR) will be used to examine theoretical basis and assess adherence to reporting guidelines for intervention description. A small number of heterogeneous studies are likely to be included in this review therefore a narrative synthesis is planned.

The study objective was to estimate infection risks per transport for first responders and quantify how first responder use of N95 respirators and patient use of cloth masks can reduce these risks. A model was developed for two Scenarios: an ambulance transport with a patient actively emitting a virus in small aerosols that could lead to airborne transmission (Scenario 1) and a subsequent transport with the same respirator or mask use conditions, an uninfected patient; and remaining airborne SARS-CoV-2 and contaminated surfaces due to aerosol deposition from the previous transport (Scenario 2). A compartmental Monte Carlo simulation model was used to estimate the dispersion and deposition of SARS-CoV-2 and subsequent infection risks for first responders, accounting for variability and uncertainty in input parameters (i.e., transport duration, transfer efficiencies, SARS-CoV-2 emission rates from infected patients, etc.). Infection risk distributions and changes in concentration on hands and surfaces over time were estimated across sub-Scenarios of first responder respirator use and patient cloth mask use. For Scenario 1, predicted mean infection risks were reduced by 69%, 48%, and 85% from a baseline risk (no respirators or face masks used) of 2.9 × 10-2 ± 3.4 × 10-2 when simulated first responders wore respirators, the patient wore a cloth mask, and when first responders and the patient wore respirators or a cloth mask, respectively. For Scenario 2, infection risk reductions for these same Scenarios were 69%, 50%, and 85%, respectively (baseline risk of 7.2 × 10-3 ± 1.0 × 10-2). While aerosol transmission routes contributed more to viral dose in Scenario 1, our simulations demonstrate the ability of face masks worn by patients to additionally reduce surface transmission by reducing viral deposition on surfaces. Based on these simulations, we recommend the patient wear a face mask and first responders wear respirators, when possible, and disinfection should prioritize high use equipment.","Wilson, Amanda M; Jones, Rachael M; Lugo Lerma, Veronica; Abney, Sarah E; King, Marco-Felipe; Weir, Mark H; Sexton, Jonathan D; Noakes, Catherine J; Reynolds, Kelly A",Journal of occupational and environmental hygiene,3,17

Whole inactivated virus (WIV) vaccines represent an ideal strategy for this purpose; however, a universal method for producing safe and immunogenic inactivated vaccines is lacking. Conventional pathogen inactivation methods such as formalin, heat, ultraviolet light, and gamma rays cause structural alterations in vaccines that lead to reduced neutralizing antibody specificity, and in some cases, disastrous T helper type 2-mediated immune pathology. We have evaluated the potential of a visible ultrashort pulsed (USP) laser method to generate safe and immunogenic WIV vaccines without adjuvants. Specifically, we demonstrate that vaccination of mice with laser-inactivated H1N1 influenza virus at about a 10-fold lower dose than that required using conventional formalin-inactivated influenza vaccines results in protection against lethal H1N1 challenge in mice. The virus, inactivated by the USP laser irradiation, has been shown to retain its surface protein structure through hemagglutination assay. Unlike conventional inactivation methods, laser treatment did not generate carbonyl groups in protein, thereby reducing the risk of adverse vaccine-elicited T helper type 2 responses. Therefore, USP laser treatment is an attractive potential strategy to generate WIV vaccines with greater potency and safety than vaccines produced by current inactivation techniques.","Tsen, Shaw-Wei David; Donthi, Nisha; La, Victor; Hsieh, Wen-Han; Li, Yen-Der; Knoff, Jayne; Chen, Alexander; Wu, Tzyy-Choou; Hung, Chien-Fu; Achilefu, Samuel; Tsen, Kong-Thon",Journal of biomedical optics,3,1

Although many studies examined this association, the evidence has not been reviewed systematically. We therefore undertook a systematic review to synthesize evidence examining the association of maternal diet and physical activity before and during pregnancy with offspring's blood pressure and vascular health. We systematically searched the databases MEDLINE and EMBASE from inception to June 30, 2017. Eligibility screening, data extraction and quality assessment were performed by two independent reviewers. A total of 19 articles were included comprising three randomized controlled trials and 16 observational studies. Of the studies that examined the association of interest, 60% (three out of five studies) showed that high maternal carbohydrate intake was associated with higher offspring's blood pressure. Maternal protein intake during pregnancy was negatively associated with offspring carotid intima-media thickness in two out of two studies. No consistent findings for maternal fatty acid intake were found. There were too few studies to draw conclusions on energy intake, fibre intake, protein/carbohydrate ratio, specific foods, dietary patterns and maternal physical activity. Heterogeneity in exposure and outcome assessment hampered pooling. Also, owing to the observational nature of most studies, causality cannot be established. Harmonization of valid exposure and outcome measurements, and the development of core outcome sets are needed to enable more robust conclusions.","van Elten, T M; Karsten, M D A; van Poppel, M N M; Geelen, A; Limpens, J; Roseboom, T J; Gemke, R J B J",Journal of developmental origins of health and disease,3,1

PRESENTATION OF CASE We describe an acute, unexpected and life threatening cardiovascular (CV) collapse, presumed to be due to an acute anaphylactic reaction secondary to gelatin administration, following induction of general anaesthesia (GA), in an ASA 3 patient scheduled for axillo-bifemoral bypass. DISCUSSION The management of the profound cardiovascular (CV) collapse was greatly assisted by sophisticated haemodynamic, depth of anaesthesia and cerebral oximetry monitoring.(1) As far as we are aware this is the first such case where the full haemodynamic, depth of anaesthesia and cerebral oxygenation changes during CV collapse, presumed due to an acute anaphylactic reaction under GA have been fully documented. CONCLUSION The use of advanced monitoring intraoperatively proved extremely useful in guiding the resuscitation of a life threatening allergic reaction under general anaesthesia.","Tan, A; Shephard, B; Green, D",International journal of surgery case reports,3,1

Subgroup analyses from previous studies suggest that anticoagulation could reduce recurrent stroke compared with antiplatelet therapy. We hypothesised that anticoagulant treatment with rivaroxaban, an oral factor Xa inhibitor, would reduce the risk of recurrent ischaemic stroke compared with aspirin among patients with PFO enrolled in the NAVIGATE ESUS trial. METHODS NAVIGATE ESUS was a double-blinded, randomised, phase 3 trial done at 459 centres in 31 countries that assessed the efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban versus aspirin for secondary stroke prevention in patients with ESUS. For this prespecified subgroup analysis, cohorts with and without PFO were defined on the basis of transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE). The primary efficacy outcome was time to recurrent ischaemic stroke between treatment groups. The primary safety outcome was major bleeding, according to the criteria of the International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis. The primary analyses were based on the intention-to-treat population. Additionally, we did a systematic review and random-effects meta-analysis of studies in which patients with cryptogenic stroke and PFO were randomly assigned to receive anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy. FINDINGS Between Dec 23, 2014, and Sept 20, 2017, 7213 participants were enrolled and assigned to receive rivaroxaban (n=3609) or aspirin (n=3604). Patients were followed up for a mean of 11 months because of early trial termination. PFO was reported as present in 534 (7·4%) patients on the basis of either TTE or TOE. Patients with PFO assigned to receive aspirin had a recurrent ischaemic stroke rate of 4·8 events per 100 person-years compared with 2·6 events per 100 person-years in those treated with rivaroxaban. Among patients with known PFO, there was insufficient evidence to support a difference in risk of recurrent ischaemic stroke between rivaroxaban and aspirin (hazard ratio [HR] 0·54; 95% CI 0·22-1·36), and the risk was similar for those without known PFO (1·06; 0·84-1·33; pinteraction=0·18). The risks of major bleeding with rivaroxaban versus aspirin were similar in patients with PFO detected (HR 2·05; 95% CI 0·51-8·18) and in those without PFO detected (HR 2·82; 95% CI 1·69-4·70; pinteraction=0·68). The random-effects meta-analysis combined data from NAVIGATE ESUS with data from two previous trials (PICSS and CLOSE) and yielded a summary odds ratio of 0·48 (95% CI 0·24-0·96; p=0·04) for ischaemic stroke in favour of anticoagulation, without evidence of heterogeneity. INTERPRETATION Among patients with ESUS who have PFO, anticoagulation might reduce the risk of recurrent stroke by about half, although substantial imprecision remains. Dedicated trials of anticoagulation versus antiplatelet therapy or PFO closure, or both, are warranted.

METHODS A total of sixty patients with CVI were enrolled in the study. The patients were C2-6 according to the CEAP classification. All the patients were assessed with Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS) for clinical severity, Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain, right and left lower limb (RLL and LLL) circumference measurements for edema, 6-min-walk test (6-MWT) for functional capacity, Lower Extremity Functional Scale (LEFS) for functionality, Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) for sleep quality, Beck Depression Inventory version I (BDI-I) for depression, and The Quality of Life Questionnaire for Chronic Venous Diseases-20 (CIVIQ-20) for QoL. RESULTS The mean age of the patients was 45.83 ± 13.25 years, and the mean duration of disease was 8.30 ± 7.42 years. There was a significant association between VCSS and VAS-rest/activity, edema-RLL/LLL, PSQI, BDI-I, LEFS, and CIVIQ-20 in patients without leg ulcers. In addition, a significant association was found between VCSS and VAS-rest/activity and CIVIQ-20 in patients with leg ulcers. CONCLUSION The current study showed that an association has been found between clinical severity and pain at rest and during activity, edema, sleep quality, depression, lower extremity function, and QoL in patients without ulcers. However, clinical severity has been correlated with only pain at rest and during activity, and QoL in patients with leg ulcers.","I, Yeldan; Karakelle S, Gürdal; Aydın G, Tosun; R, Mustafaoğlu; T, Ozalhas; Iu, Alpagut",Journal of tissue viability,3,1

Anemia of CKD is currently managed with iron supplements and erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) to promote erythropoiesis and with RBC transfusion in severe cases. Hyporesponse to ESAs, or the need for larger than usual doses to attain a given hemoglobin (Hb) level, is associated with increased morbidity and mortality and presents a pressing clinical challenge, particularly for patients on dialysis. This paper reviews ESA hyporesponse and potential new therapeutic options in the management of anemia of CKD. SUMMARY The most common causes of ESA hyporesponse include iron deficiency and inflammation, and to a lesser degree, secondary hyperparathyroidism, inadequate dialysis, malnutrition, and concomitant medications. Management of ESA hyporesponse is multipronged and involves treating low level infections, ensuring adequate nutrition, and optimizing iron status and dialysis modality, although some patients can remain refractory. Inflammation directly increases production and secretion of hepcidin, contributes to an impaired response to hypoxia, and suppresses proliferation of erythroid progenitors. Coordination of renal and hepatic erythropoietin (EPO) production and iron metabolism is under the control of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF), which are in turn regulated by HIF-prolyl hydroxylases (HIF-PHs). HIF-PHs and hepcidin are therefore attractive potential drug targets particularly in patients with ESA hyporesponse. Several oral HIF-PH inhibitors have been evaluated in patients with anemia of CKD and have been shown to increase Hb and reduce hepcidin regardless of inflammation, iron status, or dialysis modality. These sustained effects are achieved through more modest increases in endogenous EPO compared with ESAs. Key Messages: Treatments that address ESA hyporesponse remain a significant unmet clinical need in patients with anemia of CKD. New therapies such as HIF-PH inhibitors have the potential to address fundamental aspects of ESA hyporesponse and provide a new therapeutic option in these patients.","Weir, Matthew R",American journal of nephrology,3,16

This paper uses an original method to investigate the biomechanics of the cornea in response to hydrostatic loading over the typical physiological range of intra-ocular pressure (IOP) fluctuations thereby increasing understanding of clinically relevant corneal biomechanical properties and their contributions to the refractive properties of the cornea. Methods Displacement speckle pattern interferometry (DSPI) was used to measure the total surface displacement of 40 porcine and 6 human corneal-scleral specimens in response to pressure variations up to 1 mmHg from a baseline of 16.5 mmHg. All specimens were mounted in a modified artificial anterior chamber (AAC) and loaded hydrostatically. Areas of high strain in response to loading were identified by comparing the displacements across different regions. Results The nature of the response of the corneal surface to loading demonstrated high regional topographic variation. Mechanical properties were shown to be asymmetrical, and deformation of the limbal and pre-limbal regions dominated these responses respectively with over 90% (N-T) and 60% (S-I) of the total maximum displacement occurring in these regions indicating high-strain. In contrast, the curvature of the central cornea remained relatively unchanged merely translating in position. Conclusions The limbal and pre-limbal regions of the cornea appear to be fundamental to the absorption of small pressure fluctuations facilitating the curvature of the central cornea to remain relatively unchanged. The differential mechanical properties of this region could have important implications for the application of corneal surgery and corneal crosslinking, warranting further investigation.","Wilson, Abby; Jones, John; Tyrer, John R; Marshall, John",Eye and vision,3,16

Myopia prevalence changed drastically from a historical low of less than 3% to more than 50% in new generations of young adults following the Second World War. At that time, this increase was attributed to concurrent alterations in the environment and way of life which occurred in an aggressive programme of de-culturalization and re-acculturation through residential school programmes that introduced mental, emotional and physical stressors. However, the predominant idea that myopia was genetic in nature won the discussion of the day, and research in the area of environmental changes was dismissed. There may have also been an association between myopia progression and the introduction of extreme mental, emotional and physical stressors at the time. RECENT FINDINGS Since 1978, animal models of myopia have demonstrated that myopiagenesis has a strong environmental component. Furthermore, multiple studies in human populations have shown since 2005 how myopia could be produced by a combination of limited exposure to the outdoors and heavy emphasis on academic subjects associated with intense reading habits. This new knowledge was applied in the present study to unravel the causes of the historical myopia epidemics in Inuit communities. SUMMARY After reviewing the available published data on myopia prevalence in circumpolar Inuit populations in the 20th century, the most likely causes for the Inuit myopia epidemic were the combination of increased near work (from almost none to daily reading) and the move from a mostly outdoor to a much more indoor way of life, exacerbated by fewer hours of sunshine during waking hours, the lower illuminance in the Arctic and the extreme psychophysical stress due to the conditions in the Residential Schools.","Rozema, Jos J; Boulet, Charles; Cohen, Yuval; Stell, William K; Iribarren, Luciano; van Rens, Ger H M B; Iribarren, Rafael",Ophthalmic & physiological optics : the journal of the British College of Ophthalmic Opticians,3,29

They are frequently seen in crowded inner cities as well as in forests or wooded areas, often living in proximity to humans and their pets. We examined sera from 100 wild raccoons in Japan for antibodies to six canine viruses with veterinary significance to assess their potential as reservoirs. We also aimed to understand the distribution of potentially infected wildlife. We found that 7% of samples were seropositive for canine distemper virus (CDV), 10% for canine parvovirus type 2, 2% for canine adenovirus type 1, 6% for canine adenovirus type 2, and 7% for canine coronavirus. No samples were found to be seropositive for canine parainfluenza virus. Seropositivity rates for canine distemper virus and canine parvovirus type 2 were significantly different between areas, and younger raccoons (<1 yr old) were more frequently seropositive than older raccoons. Because raccoons belong to the suborder Caniformia, similar to dogs (Canis lupus familiaris), our results suggest that they can act as reservoirs for some of these important canine viruses and might be involved in viral transmission. Further study should include isolation and analysis of canine viruses in wild raccoons from a wider area.","Aoki, Emiko; Soma, Takehisa; Yokoyama, Mayumi; Matsubayashi, Makoto; Sasai, Kazumi",Journal of wildlife diseases,3,1

BACKGROUND: Immunocompromised patients such as patients with hematological malignancies have impaired immune response to two doses of BNT162b2 (Pfizer / BioNtech) vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. Evaluation of a repeated immune stimulation with a third vaccine dose is needed. METHODS: a vaccine monitoring observatory was conducted in outpatients who were treated for lymphoid malignancies (LM) to monitor both immune and cellular response measured the day of administration of the dose 3 of the mRNA vaccine BNT162b2 and again three to four weeks. Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay was used to asses to the level of SARS-CoV-2 anti-Spike (S) antibodies (Abs) titer and SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell responses were assessed by a whole blood Interferon-Gamma Release Immuno Assay (IGRA) (QuantiFERON Human IFN-gamma SARS-CoV-2, Qiagen). RESULTS: Among the 43 assessable patients (suffering from chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) (n=15), indolent and aggressive B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) (n=14), and multiple myeloma (MM) (n=16)), 18 (41,8%) had no anti-S Abs before the dose 3 of BNT162b2 vaccine (n=9 CLL, n=8 NHL, n=1 MM), and they all 18 remained negative after the dose 3. Amongst the 25 patients with positive anti-S titers before dose 3, all patients remained positive and 23 patients increased their anti-S titer after dose 3. Patients with CLL and/or with previous anti-CD20 therapy treated within 12 months of administration of dose 3 had no significant increase of the humoral response. Among 22 available patients, dose 3 of BNT162b2 vaccine significantly increased the median IFN-gamma secretion. On eight (36.4%) patients who were double-negative for both immune and cellular response, five (22.7%) patients remained double-negative after dose 3. CONCLUSIONS Dose 3 of BNT162b2 vaccine stimulated humoral immune response among patients with LM, in particular patients with MM (who had higher anti-S baseline titer after dose 2) and those with no anti-CD20 treatment history within a year. T-cell response was increased among patients in particular with no active chemotherapy regimen. Our data support the use of an early third vaccine dose among immunocompromised patients followed for LM though some of them will still have vaccine failure.","Re, D.; Seitz-Polski, b.; Carles, M.; Brglez, V.; Graca, D.; Benzaken, S.; Liguori, s.; Zahreddine, K.; Delforge, m.; Verriere, B.; Chamorey, E.; Barriere, J.",,3,1

In COVID-19, disruption of the EC barrier results in edema, vascular inflammation, and coagulation, the hallmarks of the severe disease. However, the mechanisms by which EC are dysregulated in COVID-19 are unclear. Here, we show that the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 alone activates the EC inflammatory phenotype in a manner dependent on integrin α5β1 signaling. Incubation of human umbilical vein EC with whole spike, its receptor-binding domain, or the integrin-binding tripeptide RGD induced the nuclear translocation of NF-κB and enhanced the expression of leukocyte adhesion molecules VCAM1 and ICAM1, the adhesion of peripheral blood leukocytes, and the permeability of the monolayer. Inhibitors of integrin α5β1 activation prevented these effects. We suggest that the spike protein, through its RGD motif in the receptor-binding domain, binds to integrin α5β1 in EC to activate Rho GTPases, eNOS pathways, and the NF-κB gene expression program responsible for vascular leakage and leukocyte infiltration, respectively. These findings uncover a new direct action of SARS-CoV-2 on EC dysfunction and introduce integrin α5β1 as a promising target for treating vascular inflammation in COVID-19.","Robles, Juan Pablo; Zamora, Magdalena; de la Escalera, Gonzalo Martinez; Clapp, Carmen",bioRxiv,3,16

From June 1 to July 10, 2020, we conducted a low-intervention open-label single-centre study to evaluate safety and efficacy of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with the aerosolized combination medications (ACM) on SARS-CoV-2 incidence in 99 healthcare workers (HCWs) at a hospital that was designated to treat Covid-19 patients. We also retrospectively compared SARS-CoV-2 incidence in the ACM users to that in 268 untreated HCWs at the same hospital. Eligible participants received an aerosolized combination of 21.3 mg/ml glutathione, 8.7 mg/ml inosine in 107 mM potassium solution for 14 days. The main outcome was the frequency of laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases, defined as individuals with positive genetic or immunological tests within 28 days of the study period. During the PrEP period, solicited adverse events occurred in five participants; all were mild and transient reactions. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 2 ACM users (2%, 95% CI: 0.3% to 7.1%), which was significantly less than the incidence in 24 nonusers (9%, 95% CI: 5.8% to 13.0%; P = 0.02). Our findings might be used either to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection, or to support ongoing and new research into more effective treatments for Covid-19.

In particular, in a severe pandemic situation like COVID-19, human movements among different regions are taken as the most important point for understanding and forecasting the epidemic spread in a country. Thus, in this study, we collect big human GPS trajectory data covering the total 47 prefectures of Japan and model the daily human movements between each pair of prefectures with time-series Origin-Destination (OD) matrix. Then, given the historical observations from past days, we predict the countrywide OD matrices for the future one or more weeks by proposing a novel deep learning model called Origin-Destination Convolutional Recurrent Network (ODCRN). It integrates the recurrent and 2-dimensional graph convolutional components to deal with the highly complex spatiotemporal dependencies in sequential OD matrices. Experiment results over the entire COVID-19 period demonstrate the superiority of our proposed methodology over existing OD prediction models. Last, we apply the predicted countrywide OD matrices to the SEIR model, one of the most classic and widely used epidemic simulation model, to forecast the COVID-19 infection numbers for the entire Japan. The simulation results also demonstrate the high reliability and applicability of our countrywide OD prediction model for a pandemic scenario like COVID-19. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Jiang, R.; Wang, Z.; Cai, Z.; Yang, C.; Fan, Z.; Xia, T.; Matsubara, G.; Mizuseki, H.; Song, X.; Shibasaki, R.","European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases, ECML PKDD 2021",3,16

The effectiveness of vaccination also depends on the induced immune response. Currently there is no method to measure the cellular immune response in blood samples. The functional activity of cells of innate and adaptive immune system is determined by coordinated activity of signaling pathways, especially the JAK-STAT pathways. Using a previously described approach we developed mRNA-based tests to measure activity of these signaling pathways, and show that they can be used to measure in a quantitative manner the cellular innate and adaptive immune response to a viral infection or vaccine in whole blood, PBMC, and specific immune cell type samples. Pathway activity level and range in healthy individuals was established, enabling interpretation of a pathway activity score on a patient sample without the need for a reference sample. Evidence is presented that the pathway activity analysis may also be useful for in vitro vaccine development and assessment of vaccine immunogenicity. Other envisioned applications lie in development of immunomodulatory drugs and drug response prediction and monitoring. Tests are expected to be of value in the COVID-19 crisis. In addition to the described Affymetrix microarray-based pathway tests for measuring host immune response, qPCR-based versions are in development; the latter can in principle be performed within three hours in routine hospital labs.","Bouwman, Wilbert; Verhaegh, Wim; Holtzer, Laurent; van de Stolpe, Anja",bioRxiv,3,24

Yet immigration detention's threats to human rights did not begin with COVID-19. International treaties are clear that detaining children based on citizenship is a violation of human rights law. However, for international treaties and agreements to be fulfilled, most individual countries must enact domestic laws and policies to implement their commitments. In this study, we examine how many countries have laws to limit the detention of children.To assess the legislative protections for migrant and refugee children from detention, we created quantitatively comparable data on legal provisions across the 150 most populous UN member states. Our primary sources consisted of national-level laws, regulations, ministerial decisions, and executive decrees pertaining to asylum-seekers, refugees, and immigration.Globally, less than a quarter of countries legally protect unaccompanied asylum-seekers from detention and only 11% do so for accompanied minor migrants. Among countries that permit detention in at least some circumstances, only a minority address basic rights such as separation from adult strangers, family unity, access to education, and access to health care. Yet effective and human rights-respecting alternatives to detention exist;the evidence on these is provided.

Shelters used for this purpose usually accommodate a large number of flood evacuees for a temporary period. Floods during a pandemic result in a compound hazard. Evacuations under such situations are difficult to plan as social distancing is nearly impossible in the highly crowded shelters. This results in a multi-objective problem with conflicting objectives of maximizing the number of evacuees from flood-prone regions and minimizing the number of infections at the end of the shelter's stay. To the best of our knowledge, such a problem is yet to be explored in literature. Here we develop a simulation-optimization framework, where multiple objectives are handled with a max-min approach. The simulation model consists of an extended Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered-Susceptible model. We apply the proposed model to the flood-prone Jagatsinghpur district in the state of Odisha, India. We find that the proposed approach can provide an estimate of people required to be evacuated from individual flood-prone villages to reduce flood hazards during the pandemic. At the same time, this does not result in an uncontrolled number of new infections. The proposed approach can generalize to different regions and can provide a framework to stakeholders to manage conflicting objectives in disaster management planning and to handle compound hazards.","Tripathy, S.

As an important element of the tremendous diversity of flower morphology, the corolla tube plays a critical role in many specialized interactions between plants and animal pollinators (e.g., beeflies, hawkmoths, hummingbirds, nectar bats), which in turn drives rapid plant speciation. Despite its clear significance in plant reproduction and evolution, the corolla tube remains one of the least understood plant structures from a developmental genetics perspective. Through mutant analyses and transgenic experiments, here we show that the tasiRNA-ARF pathway is required for corolla tube formation in the monkeyflower species Mimulus lewisii. Loss-of-function mutations in the M. lewisii orthologs of ARGONAUTE7 and SUPPRESSOR OF GENE SILENCING 3 cause a dramatic decrease in abundance of TAS3-derived small RNAs and a moderate up-regulation of AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 3 (ARF3) and ARF4, which lead to inhibition of lateral expansion of the bases of petal primordia and complete arrest of the upward growth of the inter-primordial regions, resulting in unfused corollas. By using an auxin reporter construct, we discovered that auxin distribution is continuous along the petal primordium base and the inter-primordial region during the critical stage of corolla tube formation in the wild-type, and that this auxin distribution is much weaker and more restricted in the mutant. Together, these results suggest a new conceptual model highlighting the central role of auxin directed synchronized growth of the petal primordium base and the inter-primordial region in corolla tube formation.","Ding, Baoqing; Xia, Rui; Lin, Qiaoshan; Gurung, Vandana; Sagawa, Janelle M.; Stanley, Lauren E.; Strobel, Matthew; Diggle, Pamela K.; Meyers, Blake C.; Yuan, Yao-Wu",bioRxiv,3,10

There is significant uncertainty around whether potentially infectious aerosol is produced during different lung function testing modalities; and limited data on possible mitigation strategies to reduce risk to staff and limit fallow time. Methods Healthy volunteers were recruited in an ultraclean, laminar flow theatre and had standardised spirometry as per ERS/ATS guidance, as well as peak flow measurement and FENO assessment of airway inflammation. Aerosol emission was sampled once each second using both Aerodynamic Particle Sizer (APS) and Optical Particle Sizer (OPS), and compared to breathing, speaking and coughing. Mitigation strategies such as a peak flow viral filter and a CPET facemask (to mitigate induced coughing) were tested. Results 33 healthy volunteers were recruited. Aerosol emission was highest in cough (1.61 particles/cm3/sample), followed by unfiltered peak flow (0.76 particles/cm3/sample). Filtered spirometry produced similar peak aerosol emission as talking, and addition of a viral filter to the mouthpiece reduced peak flow aerosol emission to similar levels. The filter made little difference to recorded peak flow values. FENO measurement produced negligible aerosol. Re usable CPET masks with filter reduced aerosol emission when breathing, speaking, and coughing significantly. Conclusions Compared to voluntary coughing, all lung function testing produced less aerosol. Filtered spirometry produces similar peak aerosol emission to speaking, and should not be deemed an aerosol generating procedure. The use of viral filters reduces aerosol emission in peak flow by > 10 times, and has little impact on recorded peak flow values. CPET masks are a useful option to reduce aerosol emission from induced coughing while performing spirometry.","Sheikh, S.; Hamilton, F. W.; Nava, G.; Gregson, F.; Arnold, D.

Current undergraduate students are more stressed than their predecessors and the body of literature about stressed students is growing. However, CSD students' experience may differ from their non-CSD peers and there is a dearth of literature about stressed CSD students, in particular. Method: This is a narrative review of the literature about the factors that impact stress in undergraduate students studying CSD. The review is structured using the ecological systems theoretical framework with an emphasis on the microsystems that encompass the most salient factors related to undergraduate students' stress. Factors such as family influence (e.g., parenting style, parent education), peer support, faculty relationships, minority status, technology, and individual health behaviors were explored in the literature using electronic databases. Conclusions: This review of the literature suggests that a myriad of microsystem factors contribute to the stress of undergraduate CSD students. Although the review focuses on microsystem factors that are closest to students, it is important to situate the results in context. The mental health of college students was on the decline before COVID-19, and as the economic and public health of the nation and world shift, the urgency to attend to our students increases. This review contributes to the greater understanding of CSD students' experiences that will inform programmatic and individual support.","Roos, Brianne H.; Schreck, Janet S.",Perspectives of the ASHA Special Interest Groups,3,15

Although there are different types of disinfectant agents to fight COVID-19, many of them do not have the required quality and efficiency. The present work was aimed to evaluate the quality of the available disinfectant agents using gram-negative E. coli bacteria. Materials and Methods: In the laboratory phase of the research, the gramnegative E. coli bacteria were used to evaluate the quality of disinfectants. According to the proposed laboratory method, microbial kit was prepared and used to evaluate the performance of disinfectants. Results: According to the obtained findings, 1.0 mL of the prepared microbial suspension in the test tube, as microbial kit, was used for the quality assessment of the selected disinfectants. In case of growth of microorganisms in optimum conditions, the quality of disinfectants was undesirable, and if microorganisms were not grown, the quality of disinfectants would be appropriate in terms of its effect on gram-negative bacteria. Conclusion: E. coli can be used as a reliable indicator for assessing the quality of the disinfectant and antiseptic agents used against COVID-19. © 2021. All Rights Reserved.","Fallahzadeh, R.

Consensus calling of the DNA copies increased the base-calling accuracy ∼60x, enabling accurate detection of TP53 mutations at frequencies down to 0.02%.

Design/methodology/approach: This paper’s 15 open-ended interviews with adult social care workers are complemented by digital ethnography in COVID-19 social media forums. This data set is taken from a global mixed-methods study, involving over 2,000 participants from 59 different countries. Findings: Workers reported a lack of planning, guidance and basic provisions including personal protective equipment. Work intensification brought stress, workload pressure and mental health problems. Family difficulties and challenges of living through the pandemic, often related to government restrictions, intensified these working conditions with precarious living arrangements. The workers also relayed a myriad of challenges for their residents in which, the circumstances appear to have exacerbated dementia and general health problems including dehydration, delirium and loneliness. Whilst COVID-19 was seen as partially responsible for resident deaths, the sudden disruptions to daily life and prohibitions on family visits were identified as additional contributing factors in rapid and sudden decline. Research limitations/implications: Whilst the paper’s sample cohort is small, given the significance of COVID-19 at this present time the findings shed important light on the care home experience as well as act as a baseline for future study. Social implications: Care homes bore the brunt of illness and death during the first and second COVID-19 waves in the UK, and many of the problems identified here have still yet to be actioned by the government. As people approach the summer months, an urgent review is required of what happened in care homes and this paper could act as some part of that evidence gathering.

Single-crystal X-ray diffraction and physico-chemical characterization (ATR, proton and carbon-13 NMR and UV-Visible) of LAT1 were reported. In addition, Hirshfeld surface analysis (HSA) of the solid compound, structure optimization, Mulliken and NBO charges, global indices of reactivity, local reactivity descriptors and molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) of the ligand were investigated theoretically. XRD analysis showed that LAT1 crystallizes in the triclinic space group P-1 and the structure was stabilized through hydrogen bonds. HAS revealed that H…H (46.5%) and O…H (25.7%) contacts are in control of crystal stacking. The energy gap (4.679 eV) and reactivity descriptors indicate the stability of LAT1. The Mulliken and NBO charges showed that the protons have a positive charge and the heteroatoms exhibit negative charges. The Fukui function and MEP study revealed that the heteroatoms are the most reactive sites for an electophilic attack on the ligand.

Collective physiological synchronisation of audience members was operationalised via inter-subject correlation (ISC). By assessing which musical features (obtained via Music Information Retrieval and music-theoretical analyses) evoked moments of high synchrony, logistic regressions revealed that tempo consistently predicted physiological synchrony across all concerts in Classical and Romantic styles, but not the Contemporary style. Highly synchronised responses across all three concert audiences seemed to occur during structural transitional passages, boundaries, and at phrase repetitions. The results support the idea that group synchronisation is linked to musical arousal, structural coherence, and familiarity. By employing physiological ISC and an inter-disciplinary musical analysis, the current study demonstrates a novel approach to gain valuable insight into experiences of naturalistic stimuli in an ecological context.","Czepiel, Anna; Fink, Lauren K.; Fink, Lea T.; Wald-Fuhrmann, Melanie; Tröndle, Martin; Merrill, Julia",bioRxiv,3,24

Data on cases and hospitalizations, along with phylogenetic analyses of viral isolates, demonstrate rapid community transmission throughout all five boroughs within days. The near collapse of subway ridership during the second week of March was followed within 1-2 weeks by the flattening of COVID-19 incidence curve. We observed persistently high entry into stations located along the subway line serving a principal hotspot of infection in Queens. We used smartphone tracking data to estimate the volume of subway visits originating from each zip code tabulation area (ZCTA). Across ZCTAs, the estimated volume of subway visits on March 16 was strongly predictive of subsequent COVID-19 incidence during April 1-8. In a spatial analysis, we distinguished between the conventional notion of geographic contiguity and a novel notion of contiguity along subway lines. We found that the March 16 subway-visit volume in subway-contiguous ZCTAs had an increasing effect on COVID-19 incidence during April 1-8 as we enlarged the radius of influence up to 5 connected subway stops. By contrast, the March 31 cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in geographically-contiguous ZCTAs had an increasing effect on subsequent COVID-19 incidence as we expanded the radius up to 3 connected ZCTAs. The combined evidence points to the initial citywide dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 via a subway-based network, followed by percolation of new infections within local hotspots.","Harris, J. E.",,3,15

This study also compares the results of the associated SC-Perf objectives before and after the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak lockdown situation. Design/methodology/approach: The authors undertook in-depth empirical research using a questionnaire survey to explore the performance of automotive supply chains. The sample for this study consisted of practitioners from supply chain entities such as automotive original equipment manufacturers, Tier-1 component manufacturers and lead logistics providers in Asia-Pacific (AP) emerging markets. Research questions, framework and hypotheses were developed using the literature review. Findings: The research outcome from analysis of the data the authors collected from an emerging market context, specifically the automotive sector, emphasizes the role of DSC technologies and encourages the firm’s SCR practices which, in turn, supports the SC-Perf objectives. The DSC technologies competency moderates the SCR and SC-Perf objectives relation, and the moderation effect is higher for post-COVID-19 pandemic outbreak lockdown situation than at prior state. Research limitations/implications: The scope of the study is restricted to the automotive firms in the AP region. The data were collected from a representative sample of the population through a questionnaire survey. The small size of the sample incurs a certain level of subjectivity. Practical implications: This research provides practical insights for practitioners and academicians on DSC technologies’ influence in SCR practices to improve the firm’s SC-Perf. This research shares the literature insights on use of DSC technologies across the sector to allow the automotive firm to reassess the existing operational practices. Originality/value: The paper adds insights on introducing or implementing DSC technologies across AP automotive firms to increase the operations’ performance by improving SCR practices and sustainability. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Balakrishnan, A.

For this reason, we designed a computer program using the yeast database genomic regions, and seeking two adjacent open reading frames separated only by a unique stop codon (called SORFs). Among the 58 SORFs identified, eight displayed a stop codon bypass level ranging from 3 to 25%. For each of the eight sequences, we demonstrated the presence of a poly(A) mRNA. Using isogenic [PSI(+)] and [psi(–)] yeast strains, we showed that for two of the sequences the mechanism used is a bona fide readthrough. However, the six remaining sequences were not sensitive to the PSI state, indicating either a translation termination process independent of eRF3 or a new stop codon bypass mechanism. Our results demonstrate that the presence of a stop codon in a large ORF may not always correspond to a sequencing error, or a pseudogene, but can be a recoding signal in a functional gene. This emphasizes that genome annotation should take into account the fact that recoding signals could be more frequently used than previously expected.","Namy, Olivier; Duchateau-Nguyen, Guillemette; Hatin, Isabelle; Hermann-Le Denmat, Sylvie; Termier, Michel; Rousset, Jean-Pierre",,3,31

This study aimed to evaluate the value of COVID-19 antibody rapid test assessment in emergency medical services (EMS) personnel. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted in Tehran, Iran from 20th March until 20th May 2020. The results of chest computed tomography (CT) scan, and antibody rapid test were compared in EMS personnel with confirmed COVID-19, as well as symptomatic and asymptomatic ones who had exposure to a probable/confirmed COVID-19 teammate. In symptomatic or asymptomatic individuals who were only IgM-positive, chest CT scan or RT-PCR was recommended. RESULTS: A total of 243 EMS personnel with the mean age of 36.14±8.70 (range 21 to 59) years took part in this study (87.7% were males). Most of the participants (73.3%) had history of exposure. One hundred sixty-three EMS personnel were tested using either RT-PCR test or chest CT-scan or both, and 78 (47.9%) of them had at least one positive result. Among the participants who had undergone chest CT-scan and/or RT-PCR test (n=163), 78 had positive chest CT-scan and/or RT-PCR test; of these, 18 individuals had negative results for IgM and IgG. The rate of positive IgM and IgG in participants with positive chest CT-scan was 1.6 or 1.3 times more than those with negative chest CT-scan, respectively (p < 0.05). The percentage of positive results for both IgM and IgG in participants having positive RT-PCR test was 1.7 times more than those having negative RT-PCR test (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Rapid antibody test could help in diagnosis of COVID-19 in asymptomatic or symptomatic EMS personnel who did not undergo RT-PCR test or the test was reported as negative. However, its sensitivity could be enhanced through use along with other diagnostic methods.","Saberian, Peyman; Mireskandari, Seyed Mohammad; Baratloo, Alireza; Hasani-Sharamin, Parisa; Babaniamansour, Sepideh; Aliniagerdroudbari, Ehsan; Jamshididana, Mahnaz",Arch Acad Emerg Med,3,16

Throughout the years, different doses and fractionations of RT have been used in an attempt to optimize the results. Recently, special interest has been given to hypofractionation (hypoRT) and stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). HypoRT is a relatively widespread treatment, although the accompanying level of evidence is limited. For its part, SBRT has been used specially to overdose specific areas of the disease as a boost after radiochemotherapy. In both cases, the study of how to integrate these RT tools with chemotherapy and immunotherapy is fundamental. In addition, the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic situation has sparked increased interest in hypofractionated treatments. In this review, we analyze the role of SBRT and hypoRT in the management of LA-NSCLC in accordance with current scientific evidence.

Healthcare services such as renal transplantation had to rapidly adjust and meet the needs to (1) protect patients and staff, (2) ramp up, conserve or redeploy resources while (3) ensuring that critical services remained operational. This paper aims to describe the experience of the renal transplant programme at the Singapore General Hospital (SGH) in responding to the risks and constraints posed by the pandemic. METHODS AND MATERIALS This is a review and summary of the SGH renal transplant programme's policy and protocols that were either modified or developed in response to the COVID-19 Pandemic. RESULTS A multi-pronged approach was adopted to respond to the challenges of COVID-19. These included ensuring business continuity by splitting the transplant team into different locations, adopting video and tele-consults to minimise potential patient exposure to COVID-19, streamlining work processes using electronic forms, ensuring safe paths for patients who needed to come to hospital, ring-fencing and testing new inpatients at risk for COVID-19, enhancing precautionary measures for transplant surgery, ensuring a stable supply chain of immunosuppression, and sustaining patient and staff education programmes via video conferencing. CONCLUSIONS Though the COVID-19 pandemic has reduced access to kidney transplantation, opportunities arose to adopt telemedicine into mainstream transplant practice as well as use electronic platforms to streamline work processes. Screening protocols were established to ensure that transplantation could be performed safely, while webinars reached out to empower patients to take precautions against COVID-19.","Kee, Terence; Hl, Valerie Gan; Shimin, Jasmine Chung; Sing, Tee Ping; Moi, Lu York; Peng, Chan Lai; Ht, Elizabeth Cheong; Hoon, Lee Puay; Hua, Yong Jin; Yao, Ho Quan; Thangaraju, Sobhana; Foo, Fiona; Kwan, Natelie; Ng, Eleanor; Xia, He; Lee, Constance; Boey, Shannon; Foo, Marjorie; Suai, Tan Chieh","Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore",3,19

With 4-wk-old animals, virus shedding into the intestinal lumen peaked at 72 h postinfection (hpi), and a mild, watery diarrhea appeared at 124 hpi. No intestinal lesions were seen up to 144 hpi, indicating that diarrhea does not follow mucosal damage but can precede it, as if cell dysfunction were the cause, not the consequence, of the histological lesions. Kinetic analyses with brush-border membrane vesicles isolated from infected rabbits revealed strong inhibition of both Na(+)-D-glucose (SGLT1) and Na(+)-L-leucine symport activities. For both symporters, only maximum velocity decreased with time. The density of phlorizin-binding sites and SGLT1 protein antigen in the membrane remained unaffected, indicating that the virus effect on this symporter is direct. Because SGLT1 supports water reabsorption under physiological conditions, the mechanism of rotavirus diarrhea may involve a generalized inhibition of Na(+)-solute symport systems, hence, of water reabsorption. Massive water loss through the intestine may eventually overwhelm the capacity of the organ for water reabsorption, thereby helping the diarrhea to get established.","Halaihel, N; Liévin, V; Alvarado, F; Vasseur, M",American journal of physiology.

We have shown previously that HCV NS4AB, but not the product NS4B, inhibits endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-to-Golgi protein traffic (K. V. Konan, T. H. Giddings, Jr., M. Ikeda, K. Li, S. M. Lemon, and K. Kirkegaard, J. Virol. 77:7843-7855). However, both NS4AB and NS4B can induce ""membranous web"" formation, first reported by Egger et al. (D. B Egger, R. Gosert, L. Bianchi, H. E. Blum, D. Moradpour, and K. Bienz, J. Virol. 76:5974-5984), which is also observed in HCV-infected cells (Y. Rouille, F. Helle, D. Delgrange, P. Roingeard, C. Voisset, E. Blanchard, S. Belouzard, J. McKeating, A. H. Patel, G. Maertens, T. Wakita, C. Wychowski, and J. Dubuisson, J. Virol. 80:2832-2841) and cells that bear a subgenomic NS5A-green fluorescent protein (GFP) replicon (D. Moradpour, M. J. Evans, R. Gosert, Z. Yuan, H. E. Blum, S. P. Goff, B. D. Lindenbach, and C. M. Rice, J. Virol. 78:7400-7409). To determine the intracellular origin of the web, we examined NS4B colocalization with endogenous cellular markers in the context of the full-length or subgenomic replicon. We found that, in addition to ER markers, early endosome (EE) proteins, including Rab5, were associated with web-inducing protein NS4B. Furthermore, an immunoisolated fraction containing NS4B was found to contain both ER and EE proteins. Using fluorescence microscopy, we showed that wild-type and constitutively active Rab5 proteins were associated with NS4B. Interestingly, expression of dominant-negative Rab5 resulted in significant loss of GFP fluorescence in NS5A-GFP replicon cells. We also found that a small reduction in Rab5 protein expression decreased HCV RNA synthesis significantly. Furthermore, transfection of labeled Rab5 small interfering RNAs into NS5A-GFP replicon cells resulted in a significant decrease in GFP fluorescence. Finally, Rab5 protein was found to coimmunoprecipitate with HCV NS4B. These studies suggest that EE proteins, including Rab5, may play a role in HCV genome replication or web formation.","Stone, Michelle; Jia, Shuaizheng; Heo, Won Do; Meyer, Tobias; Konan, Kouacou V",Journal of virology,3,26

Retrospectively during 1997-2003, Dutch national all-cause mortality and hospital discharge figures and virus surveillance data were used to estimate annual average influenza- and RSV-associated excess mortality and hospitalisation using rate difference methods. Influenza virus active periods were significantly associated with excess mortality among 50-64-yr-olds and the elderly, but not in younger age categories. Influenza-associated hospitalisation was highest and about equal for 0-1-yr-olds and the elderly, and also significant for low-risk adults. Hospitalisation among children was mostly due to respiratory conditions, and among adults cardiovascular complications were frequent. RSV-active periods were associated with excess mortality and hospitalisation among the elderly. The highest RSV-related excess hospitalisation was found in 0-1-yr-olds. Influenza-associated mortality was demonstrated in 50-64-yr-olds. Among low-risk individuals < or =65 yrs of age, influenza-associated hospitalisation rates were highest for 0-4-yr-olds, but also significant for 5-64-yr-olds.

The baseline characteristics, clinical profile, treatment, and outcomes in seventeen critically ill children diagnosed with MIS-C were analyzed from 1 July to 31 October, 2020. RESULTS Sixteen out of 17 children presented with hypotensive shock and respiratory distress. Mean (SD) age of PCR-negative antibody-positive and PCR-positive children was 11 (4.4) and 5 (3.7) years, respectively; P=0.007. The former group had significantly higher mean (SD) D-dimer levels [16,651 (14859) ng/mL vs 3082 (2591) ng/mL; P=0.02]. All received intensive care management and steroid therapy; 7 children received intravenous immunoglobulin. 14 children survived and 3 died.

METHODS Case patients were from Xuanwu Hospital (Capital University of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China), and all of them met clinical criteria for SARS. Healthy controls were some of the hospital employees. Endothelial injury bio-markers tPA and sTM were detected by commercial ELISA-methods. RESULTS Classic plasma markers of endothelial injury, tPA and sTM significantly elevated in SARS patients in comparison to controls [t-PA: 1.48 +/- 0.16 nmol/L versus 0.25 +/- 0.03 nmol/L (P<0.0001), and sTM: 0.26 +/- 0.06 nmol/L versus 0.14 +/- 0.02 nmol/L (P<0.05)]. The only patient who died had extremely high levels of these endothelial injury markers (t-PA: 2.77 nmol/L and sTM: 1.01 nmol/L). The likelihood ratio analysis indicated the excellent discriminating power for SARS at the optimal cut-point of 0.49 nmol/L for tPA and 0.20 nmol/L for sTM, respectively. Significant numerical correlations were found among these endothelial injury markers in SARS patients. The numerical coefficient of correlation Pearson r between t-PA and sTM was 0.5867 (P<0.05). CONCLUSION Increased plasma concentrations of tPA and sTM in patients with SARS suggest the possibility of endothelial injury. SARS patients might need anticoagulant therapy or fibrinolytic therapy in order to reverse intraalveolar coagulation, microthrombi formation, alveolar and interstitial fibrin deposition. It may not only provide a useful treatment and prognostic index but also allow a further understanding of the pathological condition of the disease.","Liu, Zhong-Hua; Wei, Ran; Wu, Ya-Ping; Lisman, Ton; Wang, Zeng-Xian; Han, Ji-Ju; Ren, Dao-Ling; Chen, Bin; Xia, Zuo-Li; Chen, Biao; Zhu, Zhen; Zhang, Yan; Cui, Xing; Hu, Hai-Tao; de Groot, Philip G; Xu, Wen-Bo",Biomedical and environmental sciences : BES,3,1

Numerous therapeutic interventions have been employed to improve patient outcomes, including inhaled epoprostenol. METHODS We examined subjects with ARDS treated with epoprostenol. We compared hospital survivors with nonsurvivors to identify predictors of mortality. RESULTS Among the cohort (n=216), there were 80 (37%) hospital survivors and 136 (63%) hospital nonsurvivors. Logistic regression revealed 5 variables associated with hospital mortality: trauma as the etiology for ARDS (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 0.09, 95% CI 0.04–0.22, P=.006), presence of both pulmonary and nonpulmonary sources of sepsis (AOR 3.06, 95% CI 1.98-4.74, P.01), an international normalized ratio of > 1.5 (AOR 3.15, 95% CI 2.19-4.54, P=.002), body mass index (1-unit increments, AOR 0.95, 95% CI 0.936-0.965, P=.001), and an incremental change in PaO2/FIO2 during the first 24 h of treatment with epoprostenol (AOR 0.99, 95% CI 0.988-0.994, P=.002). An analysis for 90-d mortality identified the same predictors, with the addition of cumulative fluid balance during treatment with epoprostenol of > 4 L also being an independent predictor (AOR 2.36, 95% CI 1.66-3.37, P=.02). CONCLUSIONS Although the use of epoprostenol in ARDS remains a therapeutic challenge, we were able to identify predictors of mortality for this important cohort of patients.

These events lead to membrane fusion and viral entry. Here, we examined the functions of the fusion peptide-proximal polar segment and membrane-proximal Trp-rich region (MPR), which are exterior to the 6HB. Alanine substitution of Trp(666), Trp(672), Phe(673), and Ile(675) in the MPR reduced entry by up to 120-fold without affecting gp120-gp41 association or cell-cell fusion. The L537A polar segment mutation led to the loss of gp120 from the gp120-gp41 complex, reduced entry by approximately 10-fold, but did not affect cell-cell fusion. Simultaneous Ala substitution of Leu(537) with Trp(666), Trp(672), Phe(673), or Ile(675) abolished entry with 50-80% reductions in cell-cell fusion. gp120-gp41 complexes of fusion-defective double mutants were resistant to soluble CD4-induced shedding of gp120, suggesting that their ability to undergo receptor-induced conformational changes was compromised. Consistent with this idea, a representative mutation, L537A/W666A, led to an approximately 80% reduction in lipophilic fluorescent dye transfer between gp120-gp41-expressing cells and receptor-expressing targets, indicating a block prior to the lipid-mixing phase. The L537A/W666A double mutation increased the chymotrypsin sensitivity of the polar segment in a trimer of hairpins model, comprising the 6HB core, the polar segment, and MPR linked N-terminally to maltose-binding protein. The data indicate that the polar segment and MPR of gp41 act synergistically in forming a fusion-competent gp120-gp41 complex and in stabilizing the membrane-interactive end of the trimer of hairpins.","Bellamy-McIntyre, Anna K; Lay, Chan-Sien; Baär, Séverine; Maerz, Anne L; Talbo, Gert H; Drummer, Heidi E; Poumbourios, Pantelis",The Journal of biological chemistry,3,1

After intranasal inoculation, virus spreads retrogradely to several brain structures along neuroanatomic projections to the main olfactory bulb. In the absence of experimental intervention, mice become moribund before the spinal cord is infected. In this study, infusions of anti-MHV neutralizing monoclonal antibodies were administered to protect mice from the MHV-JHM-induced acute encephalitis and to allow survival until virus spread to the spinal cord. Under these conditions, virus was observed to enter specific layers (primarily laminae V to VII) in the gray matter of the upper spinal cord, consistent with transneuronal spread. While the brain structures which are the sources for virus spread to the spinal cord cannot be determined with certainty, the ventral reticular nucleus is likely to be important since it is consistently and extensively labeled in all mice and receives projections from subsequently infected areas of the spinal cord. After initial entry into the gray matter, virus rapidly spread to the white matter of the spinal cord. During the early stages of this process, extensive infection of astrocytes was noted, suggesting that cell-to-cell spread via these glial cells is an important part of this process. Reports from other laboratories using cultured cells strongly suggested that astrocytes serve as important regulators of oligodendrocyte function and, by extrapolation, have a major role in vivo in the processes of both demyelination and remyelination. Thus, our results not only outline the probable pathway used by MHV-JHM to infect the white matter of the spinal cord but also, with the assumption that infection of astrocytes leads to subsequent dysfunction, raise the possibility that infection of these cells contributes to the demyelinating process.","Sun, N; Perlman, S",Journal of virology,3,12

No human cell line was previously known to be susceptible to both SARS-CoV and other human coronaviruses. Huh7 cells were found to be susceptible to both SARS-CoV, associated with SARS, and human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), usually associated with the common cold. Highly lytic and productive rates of infections within 48 h of inoculation were reproducible with both viruses. The early transcriptional profiles of host cell response to both types of infection at 2 and 4 h postinoculation were determined by using the Affymetrix HG-U133A microarray (about 22,000 genes). Much more perturbation of cellular gene transcription was observed after infection by SARS-CoV than after infection by HCoV-229E. Besides the upregulation of genes associated with apoptosis, which was exactly opposite to the previously reported effect of SARS-CoV in a colonic carcinoma cell line, genes related to inflammation, stress response, and procoagulation were also upregulated. These findings were confirmed by semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR, reverse transcription-quantitative PCR for mRNA of genes, and immunoassays for some encoded proteins. These transcriptomal changes are compatible with the histological changes of pulmonary vasculitis and microvascular thrombosis in addition to the diffuse alveolar damage involving the pneumocytes.","Tang, Bone S F; Chan, Kwok-Hung; Cheng, Vincent C C; Woo, Patrick C Y; Lau, Susanna K P; Lam, Clarence C K; Chan, Tsun-Leung; Wu, Alan K L; Hung, Ivan F N; Leung, Suet-Yi; Yuen, Kwok-Yung",Journal of virology,3,1

However, the prognosis may depend on the cancer stage and the type of treatment administered. OBJECTIVES Establishing updated treatments and care management regulations for lung cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic, based on worldwide clinical experience. METHODS This article reviews the main recommendations described by the American and European Oncology Societies managing lung cancer patients infected by COVID-19. RESULTS In the current pandemic setting, attempts should be made to avoid jeopardizing the prognosis of lung cancer patients, by maintaining current guidelines in oncology practice. In cases of patients with active infection, the recommendation is to hold treatment until recovery. For other patients, due to the aggressive nature of lung cancer, the guidelines suggest not to delay curative treatments in non-metastatic disease and provide palliative treatment in shortened protocols. CONCLUSIONS The present summary of guideline recommendations provides different management strategies for patients with lung cancer.

We employed a novel method, RT-Bst, to enrich the concentration of cDNA for subsequent multiplex PCR detection of selected RNA viruses. The RT-Bst method amplifies cDNA through reverse transcription of viral RNA using reverse transcriptase and amplification of cDNA using Bst DNA polymerase. Viral RNA was extracted from 25 nasopharyngeal samples for detection of influenza A, B and C; parainfluenza 1-4; human coronaviruses 229E and OC43; respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and rhinovirus. Both multiplex one-step RT-PCR and RT-Bst PCR were used to compare their performances for detection of virus sequences. These findings were compared with routine laboratory detection. When using RT-Bst PCR, 28% of samples yielded a viral pathogen compared to 20% with RT-PCR and 12% using routine diagnostic tests. RT-Bst PCR was shown to have particular utility in the detection of RSV RNA as this was present in 20% of the samples studied compared to 8% when using RT-PCR. For one patient, RT-Bst PCR was able to detect RSV five days earlier than conventional hospital diagnostic testing. RT-Bst and RT-Bst PCR can be used as alternative approaches to reverse transcription and one-step RT-PCR, respectively, for sequence-independent amplification of RNA virus sequences and a larger scale analysis of this new diagnostic approach is warranted.","Kabir, M S; Clements, M O; Atkins, M; Kimmitt, P T",British journal of biomedical science,3,1

This crisis occurred shortly after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. OBJECTIVE To determine whether vulnerabilities in the public health infrastructure existed in the context of emerging infectious diseases or possible bioterrorist attacks. DESIGN Key personnel involved in the Arkansas pertussis outbreak were interviewed, and health department epidemiologic data were reviewed. SETTING Observations were made for the statewide private-public management of the epidemic. PARTICIPANTS Physicians, infectious disease specialists, epidemiologists, field nurses, health department staff, laboratory staff, and administrators. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Diagnosis capability; vaccine, prophylaxis, and treatment programs; and effectiveness of global outbreak management. RESULTS Diagnosis of pertussis was a major barrier to management of the outbreak. The nonspecific clinical diagnosis, unreliability of testing methods, excessive number of samples, unavailability of reagents, and inadequate transport system, laboratory personnel, and equipment all impeded effective diagnosis. Vaccine shortage was not believed to contribute to the extent of the outbreak. Prophylaxis was problematic because of feared adverse effects of drugs and uncertainty about the efficacy of new drugs, but compliance was found to be good. From a public health perspective, isolation procedures, school absence policies, and health department referrals to private physicians all contributed to confusion. Problems with communications, staffing, and public cooperation were identified. Despite these barriers, the epidemic was well tolerated, with no known mortality and limited morbidity. CONCLUSIONS Despite many identified barriers to effective public health management, Arkansas tolerated its worst epidemic of pertussis in many years. However, were the state to experience an outbreak of a more pathogenic agent, introduced either naturally or of bioterrorist origin, these vulnerabilities could become critical. Natural outbreaks serve as excellent experiences on which to recognize and correct barriers to public health management.","Wheeler, J Gary; Tran, Tracy C; North, Paula; Beavers-May, Toni; Schutze, Gordon E; Snow, Sandra L",Archives of pediatrics & adolescent medicine,3,24

METHOD We report a retrospective case series of 10 surgical inpatients diagnosed with SARS following an outbreak in the surgical wards. Patients were included if they fulfilled the WHO case definition of probable SARS, had an active surgical problem and were admitted to the surgical wards during the outbreak period. Clinical histories, laboratory investigations and radiological findings were reviewed and analyzed. RESULTS The mean age of the cohort was 57.6 years (range: 38-78 years). Nine patients had concomitant medical conditions. Three patients were in the early postoperative period, while the remaining seven were admitted for surgical related infections. All patients presented with fever, but only eight had accompanying respiratory symptoms. Lymphopenia and raised lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was seen in seven patients. Eight patients had positive bacterial cultures. The primary abnormality on chest radiograph was air-space opacification. Rapid progression of radiological changes was seen in seven patients. Mortality rate for our cohort is 20%. CONCLUSION The diagnosis of SARS in surgical patients differs from that previously described in normal patients. An apparent cause of fever and positive blood cultures cannot exclude a diagnosis of SARS. The current WHO case definition could result in delayed or even missed diagnosis. Early isolation of febrile patients with a positive contact history must be undertaken, even in the face of another identifiable cause.","Tan, Felicia Li Sher; Loo, Wee Lim; Tan, Seck Guan; Wong, Chow Yin; Tan, Yu-Meng",ANZ journal of surgery,3,19

Its failure to grow in vitro limits epidemiological studies, characterization of the virus, and development of diagnostic techniques. The objectives of this study were to develop and standardize an antigen-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay for the detection of BoTV in fecal specimens. These assays were compared with immunoelectron microscopy (IEM) to evaluate their sensitivity, specificity, and efficiency as well as their advantages and limitations. Additionally, several methods to calculate ELISA cutoff values were used and compared using a statistical approach to obtain the optimal cutoff value for the ELISA. A plate cutoff ELISA value was determined to be the best method to calculate the cutoff value. The ELISA and RT-PCR assays developed in this study identified BoTV antigen and viral nucleic acids in feces without cross-reactions with the other calf enteric viruses examined. Both assays showed good agreement with IEM, with a Kappa value of 0.86 for ELISA and 0.85 for RT-PCR. The latter exhibited the higher analytical sensitivity. On the basis of the results obtained in this study, it is recommended that no single test should be used alone in an epidemiological survey because of the observed limitations of each assay. The fast and inexpensive ELISA combined with the highly specific and sensitive RT-PCR are a practical approach for future epidemiological studies of BoTV. These results should provide other researchers with the information needed to develop similar diagnostic assays for the study of BoTV.","Hoet, Armando E; Chang, Kyeong-Ok; Saif, Linda J","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",3,12

The AttHRV/VLP2x regimen stimulated the highest mean numbers of intestinal immunoglobulin A (IgA) ASCs prechallenge among all vaccine groups. This regimen induced partial protection against virus shedding (58%) and diarrhea (44%) upon challenge of pigs with virulent Wa HRV. The reverse VLP2x/AttHRV regimen was less efficacious than the AttHRV/VLP2x regimen in inducing IgA ASC responses and protection against diarrhea (25% protection rate) but was more efficacious than VLP3x or InactHRV3x (no protection). In conclusion, the AttHRV/VLP2x vaccination regimen stimulated the strongest B-cell responses in the intestinal mucosal immune system at challenge and conferred a moderately high protection rate against rotavirus disease, indicating that priming of the mucosal inductive site at the portal of natural infection with a replicating vaccine, followed by boosting with a nonreplicating vaccine at a second mucosal inductive site, may be a highly effective approach to stimulate the mucosal immune system and induce protective immunity against various mucosal pathogens.","Yuan, L; Iosef, C; Azevedo, M S; Kim, Y; Qian, Y; Geyer, A; Nguyen, T V; Chang, K O; Saif, L J",Journal of virology,3,28

This article elucidates portable power supply options for PAP devices with the aim to increase alternative power source awareness among medical providers. METHODS A search of scientific databases (Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and the Cochrane Library) was carried out on the topic of alternative portable power supply options for treatment of OSA. RESULTS Scientific databases listed above yielded only limited results. Most articles were found via Google search. These articles were reviewed for alternative power supply options for OSA patients when alternating current is not available. The power supply options in this article include lead-acid batteries (starter, marine and deep-cycle batteries), lithium ion batteries, solar kits, battery packs, backup power systems, portable generators, and travel-size PAP devices. CONCLUSIONS There are several options to power PAP devices with direct current when alternating current is not available. Knowledgeable primary care physicians especially in rural and remote areas can help OSA patients improve PAP compliance in order to mitigate morbidity and long-term complications of OSA.","Riaz, Muhammad; Certal, Victor; Camacho, Macario",Rural and remote health,3,1

In our study, we aimed to investigate the impact of age on postoperative weight loss at one year after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. PATIENTS AND METHODS In our clinic between May 2011 and July 2013, 55 patients who underwent LSG with the diagnosis of obesity were included in the study. Patients were divided into two groups below and over an age of 40. Preoperative and postoperative first year Body Mass Index (BMI), percent of Body Mass Index Lost (% BMIL) and Excess Body Mass Index Lost (% EBMIL) were recorded. RESULTS A total of 55 patients with a mean age of 37.2 ± 8.6 years were included in the study. 37 were women. Patients divided into the age below 40 years old (group 1, n = 29) and over 40 years old (group 2, n = 26). The average age of the groups was 29.9 ± 4.63 and 45.3 ± 7.02, respectively. Characteristics of patients among groups were similar. The preoperative average BMI of groups were 49.34 ± 5.87 kg/m² and 49.73 ± 5.38 kg/m², postoperative first year mean BMI of groups were 30.05 ± 5.78 kg/m² and 36.15 ± 6.64 kg/m², respectively. Percentage loss in BMI was 19.29 ± 3.14% and 13.58 ± 2.96%, respectively; and % EBMIL was 82.95 ± 21.88% and 56.75 ± 15.90%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS We suggest that age might be as a major determining factor for weight loss and patients over forty years old undergoing LSG for bariatric surgery should be informed about that they will have a lower weight lost.","Aslaner, A; Öngen, A; Koşar, M; Çakır, T; Mayir, B; Doğan, U; Gündüz, U; Cantilav, G; Habibi, M; Özdemir, Ş; Oruç, M T; Bülbüller, N",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,3,22

The data of hospitalized COVID19 patients, especially those with serious illness, indicate the involvement of immunopathological complications. As no effective treatment is currently available, we propose 'Primed' Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) as a therapeutic alternative to tackle devastating epidemic. The individual response to MSCs treatment is heterogeneous. During the treatment of infectious pathology, the effectiveness of the treatment may vary based on the disease scenario. Interestingly, when transplanted in vivo, MSCs are governed by the locally regulated microenvironment, suggesting that the restorative variability could be tailored by choosing a priming regimen to specifically correct a given pathology. Therefore, in our opinion, the priming of MSCs could be a novel approach to improve the responses of COVID19 patients.","Raza, Syed Shadab; Seth, Pankaj; Khan, Mohsin Ali",,3,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study of publications was carried out through search engines on the Internet using keywords. To diagnose the infection, the COVID-19 program was used on the MeDiCase platform, which is publicly available on www.medicase.pro, which suggests a diagnosis with a sensitivity of 89.47%. The study included 85 patients with acute COVID-19 with mild to moderate disease, aged 11 to 81 years. The presence of the pathogen was confirmed immunologically in 12% of patients; in other cases, the diagnosis was based on the results of an automated survey in the MeDiCase system. All patients, according to the MGNOT recommendations, were prescribed one of the oral direct anticoagulants - Eliquis at a dose of 5 mg 2 times a day, Ksarelto at a dose of 10 mg 2 times a day or Pradax at a dose of 110 mg 2 times a day for at least 2 weeks. All other drugs with antiviral, immunomodulatory effects, antibiotics were canceled. RESULTS: The presence of DIC is substantiated by the morphological picture of changes in organs and tissues, clinical (hematoma-petechial type of bleeding in combination with thromboembolic syndrome and the presence of thrombovasculitis) and laboratory changes: an increase in the level of soluble fibrin-monomer complexes, D-dimer, hyperfibrinogenaemia, less often - thrombocytopenia, violation of fibrinolytic activity. The phenomenon of consumption of clotting factors and profuse bleeding are rare. Direct anticoagulants, fresh frozen plasma transfusions and plasmapheresis are used in the treatment of disseminated intravascular coagulation. The paper presents its own positive results of early prescription at the outpatient stage of direct oral anticoagulants in prophylactic doses (no case of disease progression), individual cases of the use of fresh frozen plasma and plasapheresis. CONCLUSION: DIC syndrome with the development of thrombovasculitis is the most important pathogenetic mechanism for the development of microthrombotic and hemorrhagic disorders in organs during infection with COVID-19, leading to dysfunction of the lungs, brain and other nerve tissues, kidneys, thromboembolic complications, etc. Many symptoms of the disease may be associated with a violation of the nervous regulation of the functions of organs and systems. Prevention of thrombovasculitis is effective already at the stage of the first manifestation of the disease with the outpatient use of direct anticoagulants (oral, low molecular weight heparins). In case of more severe manifestations (complications) of the disease, additional use of freshly frozen plasma and plasmapheresis is effective.","Vorobyev, P A; Momot, A P; Krasnova, L S; Vorobiev, A P; Talipov, A K",Ter Arkh,3,16

COVID-19 has been associated with increased rates of both venous and arterial thromboembolic events, a source of significant morbidity and mortality in this disease. Further evidence suggests a link between the inflammatory response and coagulopathy associated with COVID-19. This presents a unique set of challenges for diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of thrombotic complications. In this review, we summarize and discuss the current literature on laboratory coagulation disruptions associated with COVID-19 and the clinical effects of thromboembolic events including pulmonary embolism (PE), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), peripheral arterial thrombosis, and acute ischemic stroke in COVID-19. Endothelial injury and augmented innate immune response are implicated in the development of diffuse macro- and microvascular thrombosis in COVID-19. The pathophysiology of COVID-19 associated coagulopathy is an important determinant of appropriate treatment and monitoring of these complications. We highlight the importance of diagnosis and management of dysregulated coagulation in COVID-19 in order to improve outcomes in COVID-19 patients with thromboembolic complications.","Goswami, Julie; MacArthur, Taleen A; Sridharan, Meera; Pruthi, Rajiv K; McBane, Robert D; Witzig, Thomas E; Park, Myung S",Shock (Augusta Ga.),3,10

Methods: A total of 191 cases of diagnosed and suspected COVID-19 patients admitted in Febrary 2020 in Wuhan Leishenshan Hospital were included. The patients were divided into 2019-nCoV continuous positive group, 2019-nCoV positive to negative group, and 2019-nCoV suspect group according to the results of pharyngeal swab 2019-nCoV nucleic acid detection. In addition, 27 patients without COVID-19 were set as control group to test the specificity. The serum samples were collected, and colloidal gold and chemiluminescence method were used to detect total antibodies (IgM+IgG) and IgM. SPSS 24.0 was used to compare the difference in antibody detection rates between the two methods. Results: The specificity of total antibodies (IgM+IgG) and IgM detection was 100%. Two methods of total antibody detection had no significant difference in continuous positive group (P=1.00). In positive to negative group and suspect group, the positive detection rate of chemiluminescence method was significantly higher than colloidal gold method (95.2% vs 76.2% and 94.9% vs 70.5%, respectively, both P&lt;0.05). The chemiluminescence method showed no significant difference between the three groups in IgM detection (P&gt;0.05).

This study examined the evolution of psychosocial impacts with the progression of the pandemic in adult populations from different countries and continents, and identified, among a wide range of individual and country-level factors, which ones are contributing to this evolving psychological response. An online survey was conducted in May/June 2020 and in November 2020, among a sample of 17,833 adults (Phase 1: 8806; Phase 2: 9027) from eight countries/regions (Canada, the United States, England, Switzerland, Belgium, Hong Kong, the Philippines, New Zealand). Probable generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and major depressive episode (MDE) were assessed. The independent role of potential factors was examined using multilevel logistic regression. Probable GAD or MDE was indicated by 30.1% and 32.5% of the respondents during phases 1 and 2, respectively (a 7.9% increase over time), with an important variation according to countries/regions (range from 22.3% in Switzerland to 38.8% in the Philippines). This proportion exceeded 50% among young adults (18-24 years old) in all countries except for Switzerland. Beyond young age, several factors negatively influenced mental health in times of pandemic; important factors were found, including weak sense of coherence (adjusted odds ratio aOR = 3.89), false beliefs (aOR = 2.33), and self-isolation/quarantine (aOR = 2.01).

DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Cochrane CENTRAL databases were searched from conception until July 2020 for studies comparing infected HCWs (cases) and non-infected HCWs (controls) and risk factors for infection. Outcomes included HCW types, infection prevention practices, and medical procedures. Pooled effect estimates with pathogen-specific stratified meta-analysis and inverse variance meta-regression analysis were completed. GRADE framework was used to rate certainty of evidence. PROSPERO (CRD42020176232) 6 April 2020. RESULTS: Fifty-four comparative studies were included (n=191,004 HCWs). Compared to non-frontline HCWs, frontline HCWs were at increased infection risk (OR 1.66 95%CI 1.24 to 2.22) and greater for HCWs involved in endotracheal intubations (risk difference [95%CI]: 35.2% [21.4 to 47.9]). Use of gloves, gown, surgical mask, N95 respirator, face protection, and infection training were each strongly protective against infection. Meta-regression showed reduced infection risk in frontline HCWs working in facilities with infection designated wards (OR -1.04, 95%CI -1.53 to -0.33, p=0.004) and performing aerosol-generating medical procedures in designated centres (OR -1.30 95%CI -2.52 to -0.08; p=0.037). CONCLUSIONS: During highly infectious respiratory pandemics, widely available protective measures such as use of gloves, gowns, and face masks are strongly protective against infection and should be instituted, preferably in dedicated settings, to protect frontline HCW during waves of respiratory virus pandemics.","Tian, Chenchen; Lovrics, Olivia; Vaisman, Alon; Chin, Ki Jinn; Tomlinson, George; Lee, Yung; Englesakis, Marina; Parotto, Matteo; Singh, Mandeep",Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,3,1

However, ozonation catalysts with combined merits of high activity, good reusability and low cost for practical industrial applications are still rare. This study aims to develop an efficient, stable and economic ozonation catalyst for the degradation of Ibuprofen, a pharmaceutical compound frequently detected as a refractory pollutant in treated wastewaters. The novel three-dimensional network-structured catalyst, comprising of Î´-MnO2 nanosheets grown on woven carbon microfibers (MnO2 nanosheets/carbon microfiber), was synthesized via a facile hydrothermal approach. Catalytic ozonation performance of Ibuprofen removal in water using the new catalyst proves a significant enhancement, where Ibuprofen removal efficiency of close to 90% was achieved with a catalyst loading of 1% (w/v). In contrast, conventional ozonation was only able to achieve 65% removal efficiency under the same operating condition. The enhanced performance with the new catalyst could be attributed to its significantly increased available surface active sites and improved mass transfer of reaction media, as a result of the special surface and structure properties of this new three-dimensional network-structured catalyst. Moreover, the new catalyst displays excellent stability and reusability for ibuprofen degradation over successive reaction cycles. The facile synthesis method and low-cost materials render the new catalyst high potential for industrial scaling up. With the combined advantages of high efficiency, high stability, and low cost, this study sheds new light for industrial applications of ozonation catalysts.","Ponnusamy, Guhankumar; Farzaneh, Hajar; Tong, Yongfeng; Lawler, Jenny; Liu, Zhaoyang; Saththasivam, Jayaprakash",Sci Rep,3,4

All countries are challenged, but low-income and developing countries are facing a more challenging situation than others due to their limited health infrastructure, limited financial and human resources, and limited capacity of governments to respond. Further, the interconnected nature of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis demands an integrated approach and coordinated action, which complicates decision making even more. Identifying the best set of policies and instruments to address COVID-19 challenges, and aligning them with broader social goals will be critically important for sustainable recovery from the pandemic. The key practical challenge facing the policy makers of developing countries is how to prioritize policies to achieve the interconnected goals of managing the health crisis, recovering the economy, and achieving environmental sustainability. We present a framework for identifying and prioritizing policy actions to address the COVID-19 challenges and ensure sustainable recovery. The framework outlines principles and criteria and provides insights into developing shared policy goals, identifying smart strategies, assessing policy compatibility, aligning policy instruments, and factoring sustainability into short and long-term policy decisions. This framework can assist policy makers in linking short and long-term goals, mapping the interactions of different policy options, and assessing anticipated consequences and cross-sectoral implications. This will enable policy makers to prioritize policy choices and allocate limited resources in such a way that they are directed toward actions that generate synergy and co-benefits, have multiplier effects, and achieve interconnected solutions for health, the economy and environment.","Rasul, Golam",Front Public Health,3,17

Herein, a feasible strategy was developed to reconstruct the damaged corneal surface in a goat model with total limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD) by transplanting EpiASCs, which had been explanted and cultured from the skin of an adult ram goat and were then purified by selecting single cell-derived clones and cultivating them on a denuded human amniotic membrane (HAM). These artificial tissues were then successfully transplanted into ewe goats with total LSCD. Binding of EpiASCs to the base membrane of an EpiASCs-HAM-Sheet (EHS) indicated their proliferating status. After transplantation, the EpiASCs could survive in the host tissue and they reconstructed the damaged ocular surface of total LSCD. The crystal reconstructed corneal epithelium expressed CK3 and Pax-6 similar to normal corneal epithelium and expressed the Sry gene after transplantation. These results demonstrated that EpiASCs could be induced to differentiate into corneal epithelial cell types in a corneal microenvironment and had the ability to activate corneal genetic programs.

Nowadays, social media has become the main channel through which the public can obtain information and express their opinions and feelings. This study explored public opinion in the early stages of COVID-19 in China by analyzing Sina-Weibo (a Twitter-like microblogging system in China) texts in terms of space, time, and content. Temporal changes within one-hour intervals and the spatial distribution of COVID-19-related Weibo texts were analyzed. Based on the latent Dirichlet allocation model and the random forest algorithm, a topic extraction and classification model was developed to hierarchically identify seven COVID-19-relevant topics and 13 sub-topics from Weibo texts. The results indicate that the number of Weibo texts varied over time for different topics and sub-topics corresponding with the different developmental stages of the event. The spatial distribution of COVID-19-relevant Weibo was mainly concentrated in Wuhan, Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, the Yangtze River Delta, the Pearl River Delta, and the Chengdu-Chongqing urban agglomeration. There is a synchronization between frequent daily discussions on Weibo and the trend of the COVID-19 outbreak in the real world. Public response is very sensitive to the epidemic and significant social events, especially in urban agglomerations with convenient transportation and a large population. The timely dissemination and updating of epidemic-related information and the popularization of such information by the government can contribute to stabilizing public sentiments. However, the surge of public demand and the hysteresis of social support demonstrated that the allocation of medical resources was under enormous pressure in the early stage of the epidemic. It is suggested that the government should strengthen the response in terms of public opinion and epidemic prevention and exert control in key epidemic areas, urban agglomerations, and transboundary areas at the province level. In controlling the crisis, accurate response countermeasures should be formulated following public help demands. The findings can help government and emergency agencies to better understand the public opinion and sentiments towards COVID-19, to accelerate emergency responses, and to support post-disaster management.","Han, XueHua Wang JuanLe Zhang Min Wang XiaoJie",International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,3,16

Objective: To identify the predictors associated with poor clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19. Methods: Relevant articles from PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, and Web of Science were searched and extracted as of April 5, 2020. Data of interest were collected and evaluated for their compatibility for the meta-analysis. Cumulative calculations to determine the correlation and effect estimates were performed using the Z test. Results: In total, 19 papers recording 1,934 mild and 1,644 severe cases of COVID-19 were included. Based on the initial evaluation, 62 potential risk factors were identified for the meta-analysis. Several comorbidities, including chronic respiratory disease, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension were observed more frequent among patients with severe COVID-19 than with the mild ones. Compared to the mild form, severe COVID-19 was associated with symptoms such as dyspnea, anorexia, fatigue, increased respiratory rate, and high systolic blood pressure. Lower levels of lymphocytes and hemoglobin; elevated levels of leukocytes, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, blood creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, high-sensitivity troponin, creatine kinase, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, interleukin 6, D-dimer, ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase, and procalcitonin; and a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate were also associated with severe COVID-19.

The origin and emergence of its causal agent, SARS-CoV-2, in the human population remains mysterious, although bat and pangolin were proposed to be the natural reservoirs. Strikingly, unlike the SARS-CoV-2-like coronaviruses (CoVs) identified in bats and pangolins, SARS-CoV-2 harbors a polybasic furin cleavage site in its spike (S) glycoprotein. SARS-CoV-2 uses human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as its receptor to infect cells. Receptor recognition by the S protein is the major determinant of host range, tissue tropism, and pathogenesis of coronaviruses. In an effort to search for the potential intermediate or amplifying animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2, we examined receptor activity of ACE2 from 14 mammal species and found that ACE2s from multiple species can support the infectious entry of lentiviral particles pseudotyped with the wild-type or furin cleavage site-deficient S protein of SARS-CoV-2. ACE2 of human/rhesus monkey and rat/mouse exhibited the highest and lowest receptor activities, respectively. Among the remaining species, ACE2s from rabbit and pangolin strongly bound to the S1 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 S protein and efficiently supported the pseudotyped virus infection. These findings have important implications for understanding potential natural reservoirs, zoonotic transmission, human-to-animal transmission, and use of animal models.IMPORTANCE SARS-CoV-2 uses human ACE2 as a primary receptor for host cell entry. Viral entry mediated by the interaction of ACE2 with spike protein largely determines host range and is the major constraint to interspecies transmission. We examined the receptor activity of 14 ACE2 orthologs and found that wild-type and mutant SARS-CoV-2 lacking the furin cleavage site in S protein could utilize ACE2 from a broad range of animal species to enter host cells. These results have important implications in the natural hosts, interspecies transmission, animal models, and molecular basis of receptor binding for SARS-CoV-2.","Zhao, Xuesen; Chen, Danying; Szabla, Robert; Zheng, Mei; Li, Guoli; Du, Pengcheng; Zheng, Shuangli; Li, Xinglin; Song, Chuan; Li, Rui; Guo, Ju-Tao; Junop, Murray; Zeng, Hui; Lin, Hanxin",J. virol,3,1

The World Health Organization recommends nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) such as reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) as the standard for COVID-19, with a sensitivity of 95%. However, many factors can affect the results including timing of test, specimen quality, specimen handling, pooling specimens, and other technical reasons, resulting in false negatives. The case below describes a patient with a clinical presentation concerning for COVID-19 despite three negative RT-PCR tests and highlights the importance of treating patients based on their entire clinical impression rather than a single data point. A 53-year-old Hispanic male with no medical history presented to the hospital with 4 days of dyspnea and cough. He was admitted to the intensive care unit with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring heated high flow nasal cannula. No associated fever, myalgias, anosmia, diarrhea, and he denied any known ill contacts, inhalation exposures or prior smoking history. Laboratory workup was notable for thrombocytosis, lymphopenia, elevated ferritin, C-reactive protein, D-dimer and lactate dehydrogenase as commonly seen with COVID-19. Infectious screen resulted with negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR by nasal swab, negative respiratory viral panel, negative HIV PCR, and negative fungal pneumonia screen. Imaging showed bilateral ground-glass opacities consistent with multifocal pneumonia (figure). He was started on a 5-day course of antibiotics for community acquired pneumonia and given high suspicion for COVID-19 pneumonia was started on dexamethasone 6mg daily with a plan to repeat SARS-CoV-2 testing. Repeat SARS-CoV-2 PCR was negative on hospital day 2 and 4 but SARS-CoV-2 antibody was positive on hospital day 6 (10 days after symptom onset). Given the positive antibody test and clinical course consistent with COVID-19 pneumonia, he was continued on dexamethasone for a total of 10 days, completed a 5-day course of remdesivir, and received 1 unit of convalescent plasma with clinical improvement. He was discharged home on hospital day 15 with supplemental oxygen. With increasing rates of infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, it becomes critically important to quickly and accurately diagnose patients. While RT-PCR has high sensitivity, there are still several factors that affect the accuracy and may result in false-negative results with potential implications such as delay in treatment and failure to quarantine. This case highlights the importance to treat patients based on a comprehensive clinical impression rather than a single test result.","Clark, A.; Burton, M.; Nazir, U.; Thomas, L.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,3,14

Especially for adolescents, who highly rely on social contacts with peers, the prolonged period of social isolation may have detrimental effects on their mental health. Based on the mood management theory, the current study examines if social media are beneficial for adolescents to cope with feelings of anxiety and loneliness during the quarantine. A survey study among 2,165 (Belgian) adolescents (13-19 years old) tested how feelings of anxiety and loneliness contributed to their happiness level, and whether different social media coping strategies (active, social relations, and humor) mediated these relations. Structural equation modeling revealed that feelings of loneliness had a higher negative impact on adolescents' happiness than feelings of anxiety. However, anxious participants indicated to use social media more often to actively seek for a manner to adapt to the current situation, and to a lesser extent as a way to keep in touch with friends and family. The indirect effect of anxiety on happiness through active coping was significantly positive. Participants who were feeling lonely were more inclined to use social media to cope with lacking social contact. However, this coping strategy was not significantly related to their happiness feelings. Humorous coping was positively related with feelings of happiness, but not influenced by loneliness or anxiety. To conclude, social media can be used as a constructive coping strategy for adolescents to deal with anxious feelings during the COVID-19 quarantine.","Cauberghe, Verolien; Van Wesenbeeck, Ini; De Jans, Steffi; Hudders, Liselot; Ponnet, Koen",Cyberpsychology behav. soc. netw.

AIMS: This study aims to compare the clinical and demographic characteristics of patients with cancer (with and without COVID-19) and characterize the clinical outcomes of patients with COVID-19 and cancer. METHODS AND RESULTS: Real-world data (RWD) from two health systems were used to identify 146 702 adults diagnosed with cancer between 2015 and 2020; 1267 COVID-19 cases were identified between February 1 and July 30, 2020. Demographic, clinical, and socioeconomic characteristics were extracted. Incidence of all-cause mortality, hospitalizations, and invasive respiratory support was assessed between February 1 and August 14, 2020. Among patients with cancer, patients with COVID-19 were more likely to be Non-Hispanic black (NHB), have active cancer, have comorbidities, and/or live in zip codes with median household income <$30 000. Patients with COVID-19 living in lower-income areas and NHB patients were at greatest risk for hospitalization from pneumonia, fluid and electrolyte disorders, cough, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure and were more likely to receive hydroxychloroquine. All-cause mortality, hospital admission, and invasive respiratory support were more frequent among patients with cancer and COVID-19.

Similar to conventional transvenous pacemakers, satisfying pacing values during implantation are targeted for optimal long-term device function. The objective is to investigate the role of a local injury current (IC) in leadless pacemaker implantations. METHOD: The IC, sensing value, capture threshold and impedance were collected in 30 consecutive patients receiving a leadless pacemaker. RESULTS: 39 EGMs were recorded from 30 patients (including 9 device repositions). An IC was detected in 15 cases (38%). At implantation, the presence of an IC was associated with a significantly lower sensing (7.1â¯±â¯3.7â¯mV vs 12.0â¯±â¯4.0â¯mV; Pâ¯=â¯0.004) and a higher capture threshold (median threshold 1.13â¯V at 0.24â¯ms [0.50-2.00] vs 0.50â¯V at 0.24â¯ms [0.25-0.75]; Pâ¯=â¯0.002) and with a 26 fold higher likelihood of device repositioning compared to the absence of an IC (OR 26.3 [2.79-248], Pâ¯<â¯0.001). Patients with an IC in their final implant position had a lower sensing (9.3â¯±â¯4.4â¯mV vs 13.6â¯±â¯4.7â¯mV at implantation, Pâ¯=â¯0.04), while the initially similar capture threshold was lower after 24â¯h in the IC group. After 2â¯weeks, all parameters were similar between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that an IC can readily be observed during leadless pacemaker implantation associated with a lower sensing and a higher capture threshold at implantation but with similar to even better values during follow-up.","Breitenstein, Alexander; Saguner, Ardan M; Gasperetti, Alessio; Hofer, Daniel; Koepfli, Pascal; Regoli, François; Steffel, Jan",Int. j. cardiol,3,21

Research Method/Design: A cross-sectional survey design was implemented. The total number of participants were 269 individuals with self-reported disabilities and chronic conditions (Mage = 39.37, SDage = 12.18). We examined the relationship between perceived stress and coping strategies related to COVID-19, and which COVID-19 coping strategies were associated with well-being after controlling for demographic and psychological characteristics. RESULTS: Correlation analyses demonstrated that perceived stress related to COVID-19 was positively associated with coping strategies including self-distraction, denial, substance use, behavioral disengagement, venting, planning, religion, and self-blame. Further, hierarchical regression results demonstrated that active coping, denial, use of emotional support, humor, religion, and self-blame were associated with participants' well-being after controlling for demographic and psychological characteristics. CONCLUSIONS/IMPLICATIONS: This exploratory study findings suggest that measuring and quantifying COVID-19 related stress and coping strategies in individuals with chronic conditions and disabilities can help clinicians and researchers understand potential effects of COVID-19 among people with chronic conditions and disabilities.

However, manually labeling data for entity tasks is time consuming and expensive, creating barriers to using machine learning in new medical applications. Weakly supervised learning, which automatically builds imperfect training sets from low cost, less accurate labeling rules, offers a potential solution. Medical ontologies are compelling sources for generating labels, however combining multiple ontologies without ground truth data creates challenges due to label noise introduced by conflicting entity definitions. Key questions remain on the extent to which weakly supervised entity classification can be automated using ontologies, or how much additional task-specific rule engineering is required for state-of-the-art performance. Also unclear is how pre-trained language models, such as BioBERT, improve the ability to generalize from imperfectly labeled data. Results: We present Trove, a framework for weakly supervised entity classification using medical ontologies. We report state-of-the-art, weakly supervised performance on two NER benchmark datasets and establish new baselines for two entity classification tasks in clinical text. We perform within an average of 3.5 F1 points (4.2%) of NER classifiers trained with hand-labeled data. Automatically learning label source accuracies to correct for label noise provided an average improvement of 3.9 F1 points. BioBERT provided an average improvement of 0.9 F1 points. We measure the impact of combining large numbers of ontologies and present a case study on rapidly building classifiers for COVID-19 clinical tasks. Our framework demonstrates how a wide range of medical entity classifiers can be quickly constructed using weak supervision and without requiring manually-labeled training data.","Fries, Jason A.; Steinberg, Ethan; Khattar, Saelig; Fleming, Scott L.; Posada, Jose; Callahan, Alison; Shah, Nigam H.",,3,30

The management of vascular access during the epidemic is currently unknown. METHODS: In this multicenter cross-sectional study, we collected vascular access data from hemodialysis patients treated at 44 hospitals in Hubei from 22 January to 10 March 2020. We estimated the management of vascular access during the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak. RESULTS: Of the 9231 hemodialysis patients included, 5387 patients (58.4%) were men and 2959 patients (32.1%) were older than 65 years. Arteriovenous fistula was the predominant type of vascular access, accounting for 76.5%; 496 patients (5.4%) developed vascular access complications; catheter flow reduction was the most common vascular access complication, and stenosis was the predominant complication among those with arteriovenous access. Overall, 280 vascular access sites were placed in patients newly diagnosed with uremia, of whom 260 (92.8%) underwent catheter insertion; 149 rescue procedures were carried out to treat the vascular access complications, which consisted of 132 catheters, 7 percutaneous transluminal angioplasties, 6 arteriovenous fistula repairs, and 4 arteriovenous fistulas. Occlusion of the arteriovenous access had the highest rescue rate (92.7%), while many other vascular access complications remained untreated; 69 and 142 patients were diagnosed with confirmed and suspected coronavirus disease 2019, respectively. A total of 146 patients died, of whom 29 patients (19.9%) died due to vascular access complications. CONCLUSION: Catheter flow reduction and stenosis of arteriovenous access were the major vascular access complications. Most of the vascular access sites established were catheters, and many of the vascular access complications remained untreated.","Shi, Jia; Yan, Jian-Jun; Chen, Jian; Zhang, Qing-Hong; Yang, Yi; Xing, Xue; Cheng, An-Ying; Wang, Ya-Nan; Xu, Gang; He, Fan",J Vasc Access,3,24

While many infected individuals remain asymptomatic or show mild respiratory symptoms, others develop severe pneumonia or even respiratory distress syndrome. SARS-CoV-2 is reported to be able to infect the lungs, the intestines, blood vessels, the bile ducts, the conjunctiva, macrophages, T lymphocytes, the heart, liver, kidneys, and brain. More than a third of cases displayed neurological involvement, and many severely ill patients developed multiple organ infection and injury. However, less than 1% of patients had a detectable level of SARS-CoV-2 in the blood, raising a question of how the virus spreads throughout the body. We propose that nerve terminals in the orofacial mucosa, eyes, and olfactory neuroepithelium act as entry points for the brain invasion, allowing SARS-CoV-2 to infect the brainstem. By exploiting the subcellular membrane compartments of infected cells, a feature common to all coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 is capable to disseminate from the brain to periphery via vesicular axonal transport and passive diffusion through axonal endoplasmic reticula, causing multiple organ injury independently of an underlying respiratory infection. The proposed model clarifies a wide range of clinically observed phenomena in CoVID-19 patients, such as neurological symptoms unassociated with lung pathology, protracted presence of the virus in samples obtained from recovered patients, exaggerated immune response, and multiple organ failure in severe cases with variable course and dynamics of the disease. We believe that this model can provide novel insights into CoVID-19 and its long-term sequelae, and establish a framework for further research.","Fenrich, Matija; Mrdenovic, Stefan; Balog, Marta; Tomic, Svetlana; Zjalic, Milorad; Roncevic, Alen; Mandic, Dario; Debeljak, Zeljko; Heffer, Marija",Front.

Despite this vogue, the security vulnerabilities of MLPUs remain mostly unknown. Aim: To address this concern, we conduct a study to understand the test time security vulnerabilities of the state-of-the-art MLPU systems, aiming at providing guidelines for the future development of these systems. Method: In this paper, we propose an evasion attack framework against MLPU systems. To achieve this, we first develop an algorithm to generate adversarial phishing URLs. We then reproduce 41 MLPU systems and record their baseline performance. Finally, we simulate an evasion attack to evaluate these MLPU systems against our generated adversarial URLs. Results: In comparison to previous works, our attack is: (i) effective as it evades all the models with an average success rate of 66% and 85% for famous (such as Netflix, Google) and less popular phishing targets (e.g., Wish, JBHIFI, Officeworks) respectively; (ii) realistic as it requires only 23ms to produce a new adversarial URL variant that is available for registration with a median cost of only $11.99/year. We also found that popular online services such as Google SafeBrowsing and VirusTotal are unable to detect these URLs. (iii) We find that Adversarial training (successful defence against evasion attack) does not significantly improve the robustness of these systems as it decreases the success rate of our attack by only 6% on average for all the models. (iv) Further, we identify the security vulnerabilities of the considered MLPU systems. Our findings lead to promising directions for future research.

Even if the first dosage goes uncomplicated, the second dose may be complicated by severe adverse reactions as in the following case. Case report: A 52yo male developed sudden-onset reading difficulty and aphasia 7d after the second dose of an mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. He had a previous history of myocardial infarction, arterial hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and nephrolithiasis. Blood pressure was slightly elevated on admission. Blood tests revealed mildly elevated D-dimer, pre-diabetes and hyperuricemia. Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging revealed an intracerebral bleeding (ICB) in the left temporal lobe. Aphasia resolved almost completely within a few days. Blood pressure values were normal throughout hospitalisation. Whether there was a causal relation between the ICB and the vaccination remains speculative but cannot be definitively excluded. Conclusions: A second dose of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccination may be followed by ICB. Though the pathophysiology of ICB remains unexplained a causal relation between ICB and the vaccination cannot be excluded. Risk factors for ICB should be carefully monitored in patients undergoing SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.","Finsterer, Josef; Korn, Maria",,3,16

Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is a key component of protecting frontline clinicians against infection. The benefits of PPE far outweigh the risks, nonetheless, many clinicians are exhibiting skin injury caused by PPE worn incorrectly. These skin injuries, ranging from lesions to open wounds are concerning because they increase the susceptibility of viral infection and transmission to other individuals. Early into the COVID-19 pandemic (April 2020), the U.S. National Pressure Injury Advisory Panel (NPIAP) developed a series of position statements to improve wear-ability of PPE and protect healthcare professionals and their patients as safe from harm as possible under the circumstances. The NPIAP positions, which were formed by conducting a systematic review of what was known at the time, include: (1) Prepare skin before and after wearing PPE with skin sealants, barrier creams and moisturizers; (2) Frequent PPE offloading to relieve pressure and shear applied to skin; (3) treat visible skin injuries immediately caused by PPE to minimize future infection; (4) non-porous dressings may provide additional skin protection, but lack evidence; (5) health systems should take care to educate clinicians about placement and personal hygiene related to handling PPE. Throughout all of these practices, handwashing remains a top priority to handle PPE. These NPIAP positions provided early guidance to reduce the risk of skin injury caused by PPE based on available research regarding PPE injuries, a cautious application of evidence-based recommendations on prevention of device related pressure injuries in patients and the expert opinion of the NPIAP Board of Directors. Clinicians who adhere to these recommendations reduce the prospects of skin damage and long-term effects (e.g. scarring). These simple steps to minimize the risk of skin injury and reduce the risk of coronavirus infection from PPE can help.","Padula, William V; Cuddigan, Janet; Ruotsi, Lee; Black, Joyce M; Brienza, David; Capasso, Virginia; Cox, Jill; Delmore, Barbara; Holden-Mount, Sarah; Munoz, Nancy; Nie, Ann Marie; Pittman, Joyce; Sonenblum, Sharon; Tescher, Ann",J. clin. nurs,3,22

In this paper, a framework called the Fused Attentive Generative Adversarial Networks(FA-GAN) is proposed to generate the super-resolution MR image from low-resolution magnetic resonance images, which can reduce the scanning time effectively but with high resolution MR images. In the framework of the FA-GAN, the local fusion feature block, consisting of different three-pass networks by using different convolution kernels, is proposed to extract image features at different scales. And the global feature fusion module, including the channel attention module, the self-attention module, and the fusion operation, is designed to enhance the important features of the MR image. Moreover, the spectral normalization process is introduced to make the discriminator network stable. 40 sets of 3D magnetic resonance images (each set of images contains 256 slices) are used to train the network, and 10 sets of images are used to test the proposed method. The experimental results show that the PSNR and SSIM values of the super-resolution magnetic resonance image generated by the proposed FA-GAN method are higher than the state-of-the-art reconstruction methods.","Jiang, Mingfeng; Zhi, Minghao; Wei, Liying; Yang, Xiaocheng; Zhang, Jucheng; Li, Yongming; Wang, Pin; Huang, Jiahao; Yang, Guang",,3,21

The aim of this umbrella review of meta-analyses is to determine the prevalence of anxiety and depression among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Using relevant keywords, data resources including PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane, ProQuest, Science Direct, Google Scholar and Embase were searched to obtain systematic reviews and meta-analyses reporting the prevalence of anxiety and depression among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic from the beginning of January to the end of October 2020. The random effects model was used for meta-analysis, and the I2 index was employed to assess heterogeneity among studies. Data was analyzed using STATA 14 software. RESULTS: In the primary search, 103 studies were identified, and ultimately 7 studies were included in the umbrella review. The results showed that the overall prevalence of anxiety and depression among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic was 24.94% (95% CI: 21.83-28.05, I2 = 0.0%, P = 0.804) and 24.83% (95% CI: 21.41-28.25, I2 = 0.0%, P = 0.897), respectively. CONCLUSION: This umbrella review shows that the prevalence of anxiety and depression is relatively high among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic.

It is unclear how certain species of mycobacteria transition from environmental bacteria to clinical pathogens, or what genetic elements influence the differences in virulence among strains of the same species. A potential mechanism of genetic evolution and diversity within mycobacteria is the presence of integrated viruses called prophages in the host genome. Prophages may act as carriers of bacterial genes, with the potential of altering bacterial fitness through horizontal gene transfer. In this study, we quantify the frequency and composition of prophages within mycobacteria isolated from clinical samples and compare them against the composition of PhagesDB, an environmental mycobacteriophage database. METHODS: Prophages were predicted by agreement between two discovery tools, VirSorter and Phaster, and the frequencies of integrated prophages were compared by growth rate. Prophages were assigned to PhagesDB lettered clusters. Bacterial virulence gene frequency was calculated using a combination of the Virulence Factor Database (VFDB) and the Pathosystems Resource Integration Center virulence database (Patric-VF) within the gene annotation software Prokka. CRISPR elements were discovered using CRT. ARAGORN was used to quantify tRNAs. RESULTS: Rapidly growing mycobacteria (RGM) were more likely to contain prophage than slowly growing mycobacteria (SGM). CRISPR elements were not associated with prophage abundance in mycobacteria. The abundance of tRNAs was enriched in SGM compared to RGM. We compared the abundance of bacterial virulence genes within prophage genomes from clinical isolates to mycobacteriophages from PhagesDB. Our data suggests that prophages from clinical mycobacteria are enriched for bacterial virulence genes relative to environmental mycobacteriophage from PhagesDB. CONCLUSION: Prophages are present in clinical NTM isolates. Prophages are more likely to be present in RGM compared to SGM genomes. The mechanism and selective advantage of this enrichment by growth rate remain unclear. In addition, the frequency of bacterial virulence genes in prophages from clinical NTM is enriched relative to the PhagesDB environmental proxy. This suggests prophages may act as a reservoir of genetic elements bacteria could use to thrive within a clinical environment.","Glickman, Cody; Kammlade, Sara M; Hasan, Nabeeh A; Epperson, L Elaine; Davidson, Rebecca M; Strong, Michael",Virol J,3,17

They are able to infect many host, such as mammals or birds. Whereas CoVs were identified 1930s, they became known again in 2003 as the agents of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The spike protein is thought to be essential in the process of CoVs entry, because it is associated with the binding to the receptor on the host cell. It is also involved in cell tropism and pathogenesis. Receptor recognition is the crucial step in the infection. CoVs are able to bind a variety of receptors, although the selection of receptor remains unclear. Coronaviruses were initially believed to enter cells by fusion with the plasma membrane. Further studies demonstrated that many of them involve endocytosis through clathrin-dependent, caveolae-dependent, clathrin-independent, as well as caveolae-independent mechanisms. The aim of this review is to summarise current knowledge about coronaviruses, focussing especially on CoVs entry into the host cell. Advances in understanding coronaviruses replication strategy and the functioning of the replicative structures are also highlighted. The development of host-directed antiviral therapy seems to be a promising way to treat infections with SARS-CoV or other pathogenic coronaviruses. There is still much to be discovered in the inventory of pro- and anti-viral host factors relevant for CoVs replication. The latest pandemic danger, originating from China, has given our previously prepared work even more of topicality.","Wedrowska, Ewelina; Wandtke, Tomasz; Senderek, Tomasz; Piskorska, Elzbieta; Kopinski, Piotr",Ann Agric Environ Med,3,16

METHODS: Twenty-four patients with COVID-19 were included in this study. Removal of supragingival plaque with ultrasonic instruments for 10 minutes and high-speed air-turbine using for the simulation of cutting the maxillary right canine tooth with a round diamond bur for 5 minutes were performed. Patients were randomly assigned to 2 groups: In group A, medium-volume suction was used during treatment. In group B, high-volume suction with an aerosol cannula was added to medium-volume suction. Prior to treatment, 5 glass petri dishes containing viral transport medium were placed in the operating room. After treatment, petri dishes were immediately delivered to a microbiology laboratory for real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. RESULTS: RT-PCR test results were negative for all specimens in group B. However, 5 positive test results for COVID-19 were detected in group A specimens. CONCLUSIONS: Suction with an aerosol cannula is very important to prevent COVID-19 viral contamination via aerosol. In addition, a high-volume suction capacity (air volume) of 150 mm Hg or 325 L/min is sufficient for elimination of viral contamination. Thus, high-volume suction should be used during dental treatments in COVID-19 patients.","Akin, Hakan; Karabay, Oguz; Toptan, Hande; Furuncuoglu, Halit; Kaya, Gurkan; Akin, Emine Gulsah; Koroglu, Mehmet",Int. dent. j,3,0

We believed that a specialist dedicated team would assist our medical and nursing colleagues and help identify and treat the various cardio-pulmonary pathologies contributing to the critical illness of our patients. To support our colleagues and to assist with diagnosis and treatment, we developed a specialist team. We named this team the Acute Respiratory Disease Support (ARDS) team. The purpose of our team was to provide specialist input for severely unwell patients with COVID-19 early in their disease and to assess for conditions that may respond to specific therapies including advanced pulmonary vasodilator therapy and steroids. Methods:The Acute Respiratory Disease Support team reviewed 44 consecutive patients referred from the intensive care units from mid-April to end of May 2020 on a daily basis and coordinated therapies for pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary thrombosis and evolving fibrosis. A follow-up post hospital discharge clinic was set up. Results:The mortality for this group was significantly lower (34%) than the total group admitted to critical care as a whole (51%) and for those not reviewed by the team (55%;p=0.012). Mortality among Asian and African-Caribbean patients was higher than Caucasians (p=0.035). Twenty-three patients (52%) were diagnosed with pulmonary thrombosis. Pulmonary hypertension was present in 84% of the patients. Thirty-two patients received sildenafil therapy and this was associated with improvement in right heart function in all survivors. Short time on mechanical ventilation was associated with a poorer outcome (p=0.0003). Ten patients with evolving pulmonary fibrosis and no evidence of sepsis received high dose steroid therapy in the form of intravenous pulsed methylprednisolone early in their disease. Repeat thoracic computerised tomographic (CT) scans were performed which showed excellent effect (Figure 1). Conclusion:Our experience has reinforced the concept that there are many contributing factors to impaired cardio-pulmonary function in COVID-19 patients and that many of these may be co-contributory to the patient's clinical presentation. It suggests that a coordinated specialised cardio-pulmonary team approach contributes significantly to successful management and outcome of severely unwell patients with COVID-19 and offers an important platform for continuity of patient care, education and staff well-being.","Anwar, A.; Ramos-Bascon, N.; Crerar-Gilbert, A.; Barnes, N.; Madden, B.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,3,1

In addition, incentivizing rural healthcare systems to deliver value-based care could enhance their capacity to implement population health and behavioral health strategies. To stem the spread of COVID-19 in higher-risk rural-based industries (e.g., food processing plants), SBM urges Congress to require the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to routinely inspect for and enforce COVID-19 mitigation procedures, such as provision of effective Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) to all front-line workers and consistent implementation of standardized testing and social distancing advisories.

Second, our interpretation of the control is more realistic: while in Gatto and Schellhorn the control $\alpha$ is the proportion of the population that takes a basic dose of treatment, so that $\alpha>1$ occurs only if some patients take more than a basic dose, in our paper, $\alpha$ is constrained between zero and one, and represents thus the proportion of the population undergoing treatment. Third, we provide a complete solution for the moderate infection regime (with constant treatment). Finally, we give a thorough interpretation of the control in the moderate infection regime, while Gatto and Schellhorn focussed on the interpretation of the low infection regime.

The study uses a causal-comparative model. 654 parents took part in the study. ERE for Homeschooling Questionnaire developed by researchers is used to collect the data. Descriptive statistics, independent samples t-test, and ANOVA tests are used to analyse the data. The results of the study show that ERE during the pandemic is not effective enough. However, having someone at home to support the education of children can make ERE more effective. Parents have partial health anxiety about face-to-face education. Although parents have partially positive opinions about the feasibility of home-schooling, they also emphasize the need for support for home-schooling. As the parents' education level increases, both the challenges of home-schooling and the need for support for home-schooling decrease. Parents with low income have higher health anxiety than those with high income, and parents with low income need more support for home-schooling than those with high income. Parents who support their children's learning find ERE more effective and they find home-schooling more feasible. Parents who do not support their children's learning at home need more support for homeschooling.

One of the many consequences of these governmental protection orders is to confine potential perpetrators and victims of gender-based violence in close proximity thereby reducing the opportunity for survivors to report abuse and get assistance. In this essay, we describe the multilevel governmental response in Argentina to address gender-based violence during the first month of mandatory stay-at-home order amid the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020. National and provincial governments enacted innovative and coordinated responses to gender-based violence that targeted systemic causes of gender-based violence, ensured continuity of existing services, and generated new communication strategies to allow nonverbal reporting during the pandemic. The Argentinean example suggests that governmental organizations should consider the gendered effects of government responses to emergencies and respond through a multilevel and cross-sectoral response to protect groups disproportionately affected by the crisis and resulting policy.","Polischuk, Luciana; Fay, Daniel L.",Am.

US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently included 'sudden loss of taste (dysgeusia/ageusia) and smell (anosmia/hyposmia)' as symptoms of COVID-19. If indeed these symptoms are reliable and specific forerunner symptoms of COVID-19, then it may facilitate detection and containment of the disease. Hence, we systematically evaluated the contemporary evidence on dysgeusia and anosmia as trigger prodromal symptoms, and their prevalence in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Ovid MEDLINE, EBSCO host and Web of Science databases were searched between 25 December 2019 and 30 May 2020. RESULTS: Of the 13 identified records, eight studies, totalling 11,054 COVID-19 patients, were included, as per the selection criteria. Eligible articles reflected research conducted mostly in the European community, as well as China, the US and Iran. In total, anosmia and dysgeusia symptoms were present in 74.9% and 81.3% ambulatory as well as hospitalized, mild-to-severe cases of COVID-19 patients, respectively. The European, US and Iran data indicate olfactory and gustatory symptoms appear prior to general COVID-19 symptoms in 64.5% and 54.0% of the patients, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review analysing the meager data based on the prevalence of chemosensory dysfunction in COVID-19. Critical analysis of such macro-data, as and when available, is essential to evaluate their utility as harbingers of COVID-19 onset, and to establish clinical practice guidelines both in dentistry and medicine.","Samaranayake, Lakshman Perera; Fakhruddin, Kausar Sadia; Panduwawala, Chamila",Acta Odontol Scand,3,13

The local approach to this problem considers each time series separately and fits a function or model to each series. The global approach fits a single function to all series. For groups of similar time series, global methods outperform the more established local methods. However, recent results show good performance of global models even in heterogeneous datasets. This suggests a more general applicability of global methods, potentially leading to more accurate tools and new scenarios to study. Formalizing the setting of forecasting a set of time series with local and global methods, we provide the following contributions: 1) Global methods are not more restrictive than local methods, both can produce the same forecasts without any assumptions about similarity of the series. Global models can succeed in a wider range of problems than previously thought. 2) Basic generalization bounds for local and global algorithms. The complexity of local methods grows with the size of the set while it remains constant for global methods. In large datasets, a global algorithm can afford to be quite complex and still benefit from better generalization. These bounds serve to clarify and support recent experimental results in the field, and guide the design of new algorithms. For the class of autoregressive models, this implies that global models can have much larger memory than local methods. 3) In an extensive empirical study, purposely naive algorithms derived from these principles, such as global linear models or deep networks result in superior accuracy. In particular, global linear models can provide competitive accuracy with two orders of magnitude fewer parameters than local methods.","Montero-Manso, Pablo; Hyndman, Rob J",,3,21

We determined the total organic C (TOC) concentrations (filtered <1-7 µm) and the ratios of TOC/dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) concentrations, electrical conductivity (EC), and pH in all major ecosystem solutions of a tropical montane forest from 1998 to 2013. The forest was located on the rim of the Amazon basin in Ecuador and experienced increasing numbers of days with >25°C, decreasing soil moisture, and rising nitrogen (N) deposition from the atmosphere during the study period. In rainfall, throughfall, mineral soil solutions (at the 0.15- and 0.30-m depths), and streamflow, TOC concentrations and fluxes decreased significantly from 1998 to 2013, while they increased in stemflow. TOC/DON ratios decreased significantly in rainfall, throughfall, soil solution at the 0.15-m depth, and streamflow. Based on &#916;14 C values, the TOC in rainfall and mineral soil solutions was 1 year old and that of litter leachate was 10 years old. The pH in litter leachate decreased with time, that in mineral soil solutions increased, while those in the other ecosystem solutions did not change. Thus, reduced TOC solubility because of lower pH values cannot explain the negative trends in TOC concentrations in most ecosystem solutions. The increasing TOC concentrations and EC in stemflow pointed at an increased leaching of TOC and other ions from the bark. Our results suggest an accelerated degradation of DOM, particularly of young DOM, associated with the production of N-rich compounds simultaneously to changing climatic conditions and increasing N availability. Thus, environmental change increased the CO2 release to the atmosphere but reduced DOM export to surface and groundwater.","Wilcke, Wolfgang; Velescu, Andre; Leimer, Sophia; Blotevogel, Simon; Alvarez, Pablo; Valarezo, Carlos",,3,1

Additional socio-economic complications such as civil war and financial crisis in Libya and other low-resource countries further complicate healthcare delivery. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey evaluating hospital and intensive care unit's capacity and readiness was performed from 16 leading Libyan hospitals in March 2020. In addition, a survey was conducted among 400 doctors who worked in these hospitals to evaluate the status of personal protective equipment. RESULTS: Out of 16 hospitals, the highest hospital capacity was 1000 in-patient beds, while the lowest was 25 beds with a median of 200 (IQR 52-417, range 25-1000) hospital beds. However, a median of only eight (IQR 6-14, range 3-37) available functioning ICU beds were reported in these hospitals.

OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this study was to evaluate safety and efficacy of higher tidal volumes (HVt) compared to moderate Vt (MVt) in people with spinal cord injury (SCI) admitted to acute inpatient rehabilitation (AIR) facility on mechanical ventilation via tracheostomy. SETTING: AIR facility in the United States. METHODS: Eighty-four adults with SCI were divided into MVt group if maximum Vt received in AIR was <15 ml/kg predicted body weight (PBW) and HVt group if maximum Vt was >15 ml/kg PBW. Primary outcomes were incidence of pneumonia and composite pulmonary adverse events (pneumonia, weaning failure, or acute care transfers due to respiratory complications). Secondary outcomes were AIR preweaning days defined as time from AIR admission to beginning of weaning, weaning days defined as days from start to end of weaning, and AIR ventilator days calculated as days on ventilator from AIR admission to discharge. RESULTS: MVt was utilized in 50 patients and HVt was utilized in 34 patients. The risk of pneumonia in HVt group was 4.3 times higher [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.5-12] compared to MVt group. Odds of pulmonary adverse events in HVt group was 5.4 times higher (CI: 1.8-17) compared to MVt group. There was no difference in preweaning days, weaning days, or AIR ventilator days between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that HVt is associated with increased risk of pneumonia and higher odds of pulmonary adverse events in tracheostomized patients with SCI which warrants further investigation.","Korupolu, Radha; Stampas, Argyrios; Uhlig-Reche, Hannah; Ciammaichella, Ellia; Mollett, Patrick John; Achilike, Emmanuel Chigozie; Pedroza, Claudia",Spinal cord,3,6

In particular, the epidemic model, that depends on some basic characteristics, has been applied to model the time evolution of the disease in Italy, India, South Korea and Iran. The economic, social and health consequences of the spread of the virus have been cataclysmic. Hence, it is essential that available mathematical models can be developed and used for the comparison to be made between published data sets and model predictions. The predictions estimated from the SIR model here, can be used in both the qualitative and quantitative analysis of the spread. It gives an insight into the spread of the virus that the published data alone cannot do by updating them and the model on a daily basis. For example, it is possible to detect the early onset of a spike in infections or the development of a second wave using our modeling approach. We considered data from March to June, 2020, when different communities are severely affected. We demonstrate predictions depending on the model's parameters related to the spread of COVID-19 until September 2020. By comparing the published data and model results, we conclude that in this way, it may be possible to better reflect the success or failure of the adequate measures implemented by governments and individuals to mitigate and control the current pandemic.","Cooper, Ian; Mondal, Argha; Antonopoulos, Chris G.",,3,33

However, the impact on maternal mortality and whether morbidity is differentially affected by disease severity at delivery and trimester of infection are unknown. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to describe disease severity and outcomes of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infections in pregnancy across the Washington State, including pregnancy complications and outcomes, hospitalization, and case fatality. STUDY DESIGN: Pregnant patients with a polymerase chain reaction-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection between March 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020, were identified in a multicenter retrospective cohort study from 35 sites in Washington State. Sites captured 61% of annual state deliveries. Case-fatality rates in pregnancy were compared with coronavirus disease 2019 fatality rates in similarly aged adults in Washington State using rate ratios and rate differences. Maternal and neonatal outcomes were compared by trimester of infection and disease severity at the time of delivery. RESULTS: The principal study findings were as follows: (1) among 240 pregnant patients in Washington State with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infections, 1 in 11 developed severe or critical disease, 1 in 10 were hospitalized for coronavirus disease 2019, and 1 in 80 died; (2) the coronavirus disease 2019-associated hospitalization rate was 3.5-fold higher than in similarly aged adults in Washington State (10.0% vs 2.8%; rate ratio, 3.5; 95% confidence interval, 2.3-5.3); (3) pregnant patients hospitalized for a respiratory concern were more likely to have a comorbidity or underlying conditions including asthma, hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, autoimmune disease, and class III obesity; (4) 3 maternal deaths (1.3%) were attributed to coronavirus disease 2019 for a maternal mortality rate of 1250 of 100,000 pregnancies (95% confidence interval, 257-3653); (5) the coronavirus disease 2019 case fatality in pregnancy was a significant 13.6-fold (95% confidence interval, 2.7-43.6) higher in pregnant patients than in similarly aged individuals in Washington State with an absolute difference in mortality rate of 1.2% (95% confidence interval, -0.3 to 2.6); and (6) preterm birth was significantly higher among women with severe or critical coronavirus disease 2019 at delivery than for women who had recovered from coronavirus disease 2019 (45.4% severe or critical coronavirus disease 2019 vs 5.2% mild coronavirus disease 2019; P<.001).

From the Entry to the Effects,13.76462,7.8626814,2020,"The severe pneumonia caused by the human Coronavirus (hCoV)-SARS-CoV-2 has inflicted heavy causalities, especially among the elderly and those with comorbid illnesses irrespective of their age. The high mortality in African-Americans and males, in general, raises the concern for a possible X-linked mediated process that could affect the viral pathogenesis and the immune system. We hypothesized that G6PD, the most common X linked enzyme deficiency associated with redox status, may have a role in severity of pneumonia. Retrospective chart review was performed in hospitalized patients with COVID19 pneumonia needing supplemental oxygen. A total of 17 patients were evaluated;six with G6PD deficiency, and 11 with normal levels. The two groups (Normal and G6PD def) were comparable in terms of age, sex and co-morbidities, and laboratory parameters-LDH, IL-6, CRP, and Ferritin, WHO ordinal scale respectively. Thirteen patients needed ventilatory support with 6 in the G6PD group (83% vs.72%). The main differences indicating increasing severity in G6PD def group included G6PD levels (12.2 vs. 5.6, P=0.0002), PaO2/FiO2 ratio (159 vs. 108, P=0.05), days before intubation (2.5 vs. 4.8 P= 0.03), days on mechanical ventilation (10.25 vs. 21 days P=0.04), hemoglobin level (10 vs. 8.1 P=0.03) and Hematocrit (32 vs. 26 P=0.015) and Mean WHO ordinal Scale at discharge (0.73 Vs 4.67 P=0.001). Only one patient with G6PD deficiency died;16 were discharged home. Our clinical series ascribes a possible biological role for G6PD deficiency in SARS-CoV2 viral proliferation. It is imperative that further studies are performed to understand the interplay between the viral and host factors in G6PD-deficiency that may lead to disparity in outcomes.","Youssef, J.; Zahiruddin, F.; Youssef, G.; Padmanabhan, S.; Ensor, J.

The CoV spike (S) glycoprotein is a key target for vaccines, therapeutic antibodies, and diagnostics. To facilitate medical countermeasure development, we determined a 3.5-angstrom-resolution cryo-electron microscopy structure of the 2019-nCoV S trimer in the prefusion conformation. The predominant state of the trimer has one of the three receptor-binding domains (RBDs) rotated up in a receptor-accessible conformation. We also provide biophysical and structural evidence that the 2019-nCoV S protein binds angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) with higher affinity than does severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV S. Additionally, we tested several published SARS-CoV RBD-specific monoclonal antibodies and found that they do not have appreciable binding to 2019-nCoV S, suggesting that antibody cross-reactivity may be limited between the two RBDs. The structure of 2019-nCoV S should enable the rapid development and evaluation of medical countermeasures to address the ongoing public health crisis.","Wrapp, Daniel; Wang, Nianshuang; Corbett, Kizzmekia S; Goldsmith, Jory A; Hsieh, Ching-Lin; Abiona, Olubukola; Graham, Barney S; McLellan, Jason S",Science,3,24

We propose a data-driven approach for automatic prediction of deterioration risk using a deep neural network that learns from chest X-ray images, and a gradient boosting model that learns from routine clinical variables. Our AI prognosis system, trained using data from 3,661 patients, achieves an AUC of 0.786 (95% CI: 0.742-0.827) when predicting deterioration within 96 hours. The deep neural network extracts informative areas of chest X-ray images to assist clinicians in interpreting the predictions, and performs comparably to two radiologists in a reader study. In order to verify performance in a real clinical setting, we silently deployed a preliminary version of the deep neural network at NYU Langone Health during the first wave of the pandemic, which produced accurate predictions in real-time.

In this perspective, perceived usability of the online learning platforms that are currently being used is an important aspect, especially due to the absence of any physical classes. In this work Microsoft Teams is used as the reference platform for which the perceived usability is evaluated. For the evaluation purpose a dual strategy is followed by using the System Usability Scale (SUS), which is a Human Computer Interaction (HCI) based approach, and a modified Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), which is an Information Systems (IS) based approach. Although both these instruments are popular in their respective domains, yet they have not been considered simultaneously in one work for the purpose of usability evaluation. By doing so, this work attempts to streamline and unify the process of usability evaluation. Results that are obtained from a large-scale survey of university students show the similarity and equivalency between the two methodologies, with the Perceived Ease of Use (PEOU) construct of TAM having greater similarity with SUS. Moreover, this work also considers the digital-divide aspect (mobile vs. web environment) that is prevalent particularly in developing countries like India, and whether it has any effect on the perceived usability.

Masks for noninvasive ventilation (NIV) in combination with viral-proof filters, worn by healthcare workers, could serve as an alternative protection measure. We determined the simulated protection factor (SPF) of such devices in comparison to conventional surgical masks, N95, and FFP3 respirators. Masks and respirators were mounted on a ventilated mannequin head in a test-chamber. Isotonic saline containing 150 MBq 99mTC-DTPA (99mTc-diethylenetriamine pentaacetate (DTPA) was nebulized inside the box. The aerosol had a mass median aerodynamic diameter of 0.6 ± 0.4 µm. SPFs were measured using radioactive DTPA particles in the mannequin test system by calculating the ratio of unfiltered particles (Pu) and filtered particles (Pf) for each tested device (SPF = Pu/Pf). Simulated protection factors were 15.6 ± 3.6 for a ResMed AcuCare mask plus filter, 3.5 ± 0.2 for a ResMed Mirage Quattro FX mask plus filter, 9.5 ± 0.8 for a Loewenstein JOYCEclinc FF mask plus filter, 1.9 ± 0.2 for a surgical mask with a rubber band, 2.7 ± 0.7 for a surgical mask with ribbons, 2.3 ± 0.3 for an FFP3 respirator, and 3.6 ± 1.3 for an N95 respirator. The ResMed AcuCare and the Loewenstein JOYCEclinic FF mask were more effective than any other of the tested devices (p < 0.001). In conclusion, masks normally used for NIV with viral-proof filters can effectively filter respirable particles.","Dellweg, Dominic; Haidl, Peter; Kerl, Jens; Maurer, Lukas; Köhler, Dieter",J Occup Environ Hyg,3,1

The Program 4 of the Healthy Aging in Industrial Environment study investigates whether the health and wellbeing benefits of physical activity (PA) can be fully realized in individuals living in highly polluted environments. Herein, we introduce the behavioral, psychological and neuroimaging protocol of the study. METHODS: This is a prospective cohort study of N = 1500 individuals aged 18-65 years comparing: (1) individuals living in the highly polluted, industrial region surrounding the city of Ostrava (n = 750), and (2) controls from the comparison region with relative low pollution levels in Southern Bohemia (n = 750). Quota sampling is used to obtain samples balanced on age, gender, PA status (60% active runners vs. 40% insufficiently active). Participants are screened and complete baseline assessments through online questionnaires and in-person lab-based assessments of physiological, biomechanical, neuroimaging and cognitive function parameters. Prospective 12-month intensive monitoring of air pollution and behavioral parameters (PA, inactivity, and sleep) follows, with a focus on PA-related injuries and psychological factors through fitness trackers, smartphones, and mobile apps. Subsequently, there will be a 5-year follow-up of the study cohort. DISCUSSION: The design of the study will allow for (1) the assessment of both short-term variation and long-term change in behavioral parameters, (2) evaluation of the incidence of musculoskeletal injuries and psychological factors impacting behavior and injury recovery, and (3) the impact that air pollution status (and change) has on behavior, psychological resilience, and injury recovery. Furthermore, the integration of MRI techniques and cognitive assessment in combination with data on behavioral, biological and environmental variables will provide an opportunity to examine brain structure and cognitive function in relation to health behavior and air pollution, as well as other factors affecting resilience against and vulnerability to adverse changes in brain structure and cognitive aging. This study will help inform individuals about personal risk factors and decision-makers about the impact of environmental factors on negative health outcomes and potential underlying biological, behavioral and psychological mechanisms. Challenges and opportunities stemming from the timing of the study that coincided with the COVID-19 pandemic are also discussed.","Elavsky, S; Jandacková, V; Knapová, L; Vasendová, V; Sebera, M; Kastovská, B; Blaschová, D; Kühnová, J; Cimler, R; Vilímek, D; Bosek, T; Koenig, J; Jandacka, D",BMC Public Health,3,16

METHODS: This multicenter retrospective case-control study was conducted at 3 academic centers from January 1 to September 1, 2020. Children with MIS-C were compared with 5 control groups: children with coronavirus disease 2019, children evaluated for MIS-C who did not meet case patient criteria, children hospitalized with febrile illness, children with Kawasaki disease, and children in Massachusetts based on US census data. Neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES) and social vulnerability index (SVI) were measured via a census-based scoring system. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine associations between SES, SVI, race and ethnicity, and MIS-C diagnosis and clinical severity as outcomes. RESULTS: Among 43 patients with MIS-C, 19 (44%) were Hispanic, 11 (26%) were Black, and 12 (28%) were white; 22 (51%) were in the lowest quartile SES, and 23 (53%) were in the highest quartile SVI. SES and SVI were similar between patients with MIS-C and coronavirus disease 2019. In multivariable analysis, lowest SES quartile (odds ratio 2.2 [95% confidence interval 1.1-4.4]), highest SVI quartile (odds ratio 2.8 [95% confidence interval 1.5-5.1]), and racial and/or ethnic minority background were associated with MIS-C diagnosis. Neither SES, SVI, race, nor ethnicity were associated with disease severity. CONCLUSIONS: Lower SES or higher SVI, Hispanic ethnicity, and Black race independently increased risk for MIS-C.

The fundamental question, how the brain adapts to periods of sensory deprivation and re-adapts to normality, has only received little attention. Here, we use eyes closed and eyes open resting-state electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings to investigate how neural activity is altered during 120 days of isolation in a spatially confined, space-analogue environment. After disentangling oscillatory patterns from 1/f activity, we show that isolation leads to a reduction in broadband power and a flattening of the 1/f spectral slope. Beyond that, we observed a reduction in alpha peak frequency during isolation, but did not find strong evidence for isolation-induced changes that are of oscillatory nature. Critically, all effects reversed upon release from isolation. These findings suggest that isolation and concomitant sensory deprivation lead to an enhanced cortical deactivation which might be explained by a reduction in the mean neuronal population firing rate.","Weber, Jan; Klein, Timo; Abeln, Vera",Sci Rep,3,16

Results demonstrate differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) is a reliable quantitative method for straight-forward and rapid evaluation of ligand binding constants for HSA and modified derivatives. DSC measured the thermodynamic stability of free and ligand-bound HSA and HSAB at pH = 6.0, 7.4 and 8.0. DSC analysis provided a quantitative gauge of responses of HSA and HSAB thermodynamic stability to ligand binding. The influence of different levels of biotinylation of HSAB on ligand binding, and how ligand binding varied as a function of pH for these molecules was also examined. In the three pH environments, biotinylation increased stability of HSAB alone compared to free HSA at pH 7.4. Stabilities of free protein and ligand-bound complexes varied with pH in the order, pH = 6.0>7.4>8.0. Our analytical approach provided very accurate estimates for known binding constants of these ligands for HSA. Results revealed, for both ligands, extent of biotinylation of HSAB affected binding, reducing binding constants from three to 100-fold. Naproxen binding was less sensitive to increased levels of biotinylation compared to bromocresol green. DSC analysis was able to delineate inter-relationships between molecular structure and thermodynamic stability of HSA and HSAB bound by ligands; and their variations with pH. This study provides another example of the general utility of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) for evaluating ligand binding constants for Human Serum Albumin (HSA).","Eskew, Matthew W; Koslen, Megan M; Benight, Albert S",Anal Biochem,3,5

ResultsThis study found that a vaccination strategy that first vaccinates the elderly would be most effective at mitigating deaths and lowering the ICU hospitalization peak during the first two months of vaccine rollout.

Pausing is released by the positive transcription elongation factor complex (P-TEFb). However, the exact mechanism by which this occurs and whether phosphorylation of the carboxyl-terminal domain of Pol II is involved in the process remains unknown. We previously reported that JMJD5 could generate tailless nucleosomes at position +1 from transcription start sites (TSS), thus perhaps enable progression of Pol II. Here we find that knockout of JMJD5 leads to accumulation of nucleosomes at position +1. Absence of JMJD5 also results in loss of or lowered transcription of a large number of genes. Interestingly, we found that phosphorylation, by CDK9, of Ser2 within two neighboring heptad repeats in the carboxyl-terminal domain of Pol II, together with phosphorylation of Ser5 within the second repeat, HR-Ser2p (1, 2)-Ser5p (2) for short, allows Pol II to bind JMJD5 via engagement of the N-terminal domain of JMJD5. We suggest that these events bring JMJD5 near the nucleosome at position +1, thus allowing JMJD5 to clip histones on this nucleosome, a phenomenon that may contribute to release of Pol II pausing.","Liu, Haolin; Ramachandran, Srinivas; Fong, Nova; Phang, Tzu; Lee, Schuyler; Parsa, Pirooz; Liu, Xinjian; Harmacek, Laura; Danhorn, Thomas; Song, Tengyao; Oh, Sangphil; Zhang, Qianqian; Chen, Zhongzhou; Zhang, Qian; Tu, Ting-Hui; Happoldt, Carrie; O039,; Conner, Brian; Janknecht, Ralf; Li, Chuan-Yuan; Marrack, Philippa; Kappler, John; Leach, Sonia; Zhang, Gongyi",Proc.

The idea that conceptual metaphors actually influence reasoning has been corroborated by Thibodeau and Boroditsky, who showed that, when crime is metaphorically presented as a beast, readers become more enforcement-oriented than when crime is metaphorically framed as a virus. Recently, Steen, Reijnierse and Burgers replied that this metaphorical framing effect does not seem to occur and suggested that the question should be rephrased about the conditions under which metaphors do or do not influence reasoning. In this paper, we investigate whether presenting the COVID-19 pandemic as a war affects people's reasoning about the pandemic. Data collected suggest that the metaphorical framing effect does not occur by default. Rather, socio-political individual variables such as speakers' political orientation and source of information favor the acceptance of metaphor congruent entailments: right-wing participants and participants relying on independent sources of information are those more conditioned by the COVID-19 war metaphor, thus more inclined to prefer bellicose options.","Panzeri, Francesca; Di Paola, Simona; Domaneschi, Filippo",PLoS One,3,23

Our study explored COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and its correlates in eight different countries around the globe. We analyzed convenience sample data collected between March 2020 and January 2021 as part of the iCARE cross-sectional study. Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were conducted to explore the correlates of vaccine hesitancy. We included 32,028 participants from eight countries, and observed that 27% of the participants exhibited vaccine hesitancy, with increases over time. France reported the highest level of hesitancy (47.3%) and Brazil reported the lowest (9.6%). Women, younger individuals (≤29 years), people living in rural areas, and those with a lower perceived income were more likely to be hesitant. People who previously received an influenza vaccine were 70% less likely to report COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. We observed that people reporting greater COVID-19 health concerns were less likely to be hesitant, whereas people with higher personal financial concerns were more likely to be hesitant. Our findings indicate that there is substantial vaccine hesitancy in several countries, with cross-national differences in the magnitude and direction of the trend. Vaccination communication initiatives should target hesitant individuals (women, younger adults, people with lower incomes and those living in rural areas), and should highlight the immediate health, social and economic benefits of vaccination across these settings.

Uganda, like many countries has been implementing VMMC for over 10 years but uptake is still low especially in northern Uganda. To attain 80% needed for public health impact, scale-up was recommended with many innovations implemented with sub-optimal results. This study therefore wanted to find out some of the correlates of VMMC uptake in Gulu district, northern Uganda. Methods: Two studies were conducted separately but data was analyzed for this study. For the quantitative study, proportions and frequencies were used to measure perception of increased risk of HIV infection using age, gender, occupation, marital and circumcision status. Qualitative study provided data from FGDs, IDIs and KIIs were first transcribed in Acholi and then translated in English. Transcripts were uploaded in MAXDQA software for data management. A code book for emerging themes was developed. Results: A total of 548 respondents were interviewed for the quantitative study, where two thirds (66%) of the participants perceived themselves to be at increased risk of HIV infection. For the qualitative study, 149 participants from 19 FGDs, 11 KIIs and 9 IDIs were interviewed. Data were analyzed thematically using both inductive and deductive approaches. Devices were preferred to conventional surgery while mobile services were preferred to static services. However, there were divergent views regarding circumcision service providers' socio-demographics and these were influenced mainly by age, level of education and location. Conclusion: People in Northern Uganda perceived themselves to be at an increased risk of HIV infection. They preferred devices to conventional surgery, mobile services to static services but had varying views about the socio-demographics of the service providers.","Nanteza, Barbara M; Gray, Ronald H; Serwadda, David; Kennedy, C; Makumbi, Fredrick",Afr Health Sci,3,24

Further resistance markers are largely unknown and would help for better stratification. METHODS: Clinical data and methylation profiles from the NOA-08 (104, elderly glioblastoma) and the EORTC 26101 (297, glioblastoma) studies and 398 patients with glioblastoma from the Heidelberg Neuro-Oncology center have been analyzed focused on the predictive effect of DNA damage response (DDR) gene methylation. Candidate genes were validated in vitro. RESULTS: Twenty-eight glioblastoma 5'-cytosine-phosphat-guanine-3' (CpGs) from 17 DDR genes negatively correlated with expression and were used together with telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) promoter mutations in further analysis. CpG methylation of DDR genes shows highest association with the mesenchymal (MES) and receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) II glioblastoma subgroup. MES tumors have lower tumor purity compared to RTK I and II subgroup tumors. CpG hypomethylation of DDR genes TP73 and PRPF19 correlated with worse patient survival in particular in MGMT promoter unmethylated tumors. TERT promoter mutation is most frequent in RTK I and II subtypes and associated with worse survival. Primary glioma cells show methylation patterns that resemble RTK I and II glioblastoma and long term established glioma cell lines do not match with glioblastoma subtypes. Silencing of selected resistance genes PRPF19 and TERT increase sensitivity to temozolomide in vitro. CONCLUSION: Hypomethylation of DDR genes and TERT promoter mutations is associated with worse tumor prognosis, dependent on the methylation cluster and MGMT promoter methylation status in IDH wild-type glioblastoma.","Kessler, Tobias; Berberich, Anne; Sadik, Ahmed; Sahm, Felix; Gorlia, Thierry; Meisner, Christoph; Hoffmann, Dirk C; Wick, Antje; Kickingereder, Philipp; Rübmann, Petra; Bendszus, Martin; Opitz, Christiane; Weller, Michael; van den Bent, Martin; Stupp, Roger; Winkler, Frank; Brandes, Alba; von Deimling, Andreas; Platten, Michael; Wick, Wolfgang",Cancer med,3,24

Background The COVID-19 crisis has created an unprecedented need for contact tracing across South Africa, requiring thousands of people to be traced and their details captured in government health databases as part of public health efforts aimed at breaking the chains of transmission. Contact tracing for COVID-19 requires the identification of persons who may have been exposed to the virus and fol-lowing them up daily for 14 days from the last point of exposure. Mining mo-bile phone location data can play a critical role in locating people from the time they were identified as contacts to the time they access medical assistance. In this case, it aids data flow to various databases designated for COVID-19 work. Methodology The researchers conducted a review of the available literature on this subject drawing from academic articles published in peer-reviewed journals, research re-ports, and other relevant national and international government documents re-porting on public health and COVID-19. Document analysis was used as the primary research method, drawing on the case studies. Contribution Contact tracing remains a critical strategy in curbing the deadly COVID-19 pan-demic in South Africa and elsewhere in the world. However, given increasing concern regarding its invasive nature and possible infringement of individual liberties, it is imperative to interrogate the challenges related to its implementa-tion to ensure a balance with public governance. The research findings can thus be used to inform policies and practices associated with contact tracing in South Africa. Findings The study found that contact tracing using mobile phone location data mining can be used to enforce quarantine measures such as lockdowns aimed at miti-gating a public health emergency such as COVID-19. However, the use of tech-nology can expose the public to criminal activities by exposing their locations. From a public governance point of view, any exposure of the public to social ills is highly undesirable. Recommendations for Practitioners In using contact tracing apps to provide pertinent data location caution needs to be exercised to ensure that sensitive private information is not made public to the extent that it compromises citizens' safety and security. The study recom-mends the development and implementation of data use protocols to support the use of this technology, in order to mitigate against infringement of individ-ual privacy and other civil liberties. Recommendations for Researchers Researchers should explore ways of improving digital applications in order to improve the acceptability of the use of contact tracing technology to manage pandemics such as COVID-19, paying attention to ethical considerations. Impact on Society Since contact tracing has implications for privacy and confidentiality it must be conducted with caution. This research highlights the challenges that the authori-ties must address to ensure that the right to privacy and confidentiality is up-held. Future Research Future research could focus on collecting primary data to provide insight on contact tracing through mining mobile phone location data. Research could also be conducted on how app-based technology can enhance the effectiveness of contact tracing in order to optimize testing and tracing coverage. This has the potential to minimize transmission whilst also minimizing tracing delays. More-over, it is important to develop contact tracing apps that are universally inter-operable and privacy-preserving. © 2021 Informing Science Institute.

A number of SARS-CoV-2 positive pregnant women have been reported. However, more information is still needed on the pregnancy outcome and the neonates regarding COVID-19 pneumonia.Material and Methods: A systematic search was done and nine articles on COVID-19 pneumonia and SARS-CoV-2 positive pregnant women were extracted. Some maternal-fetal characteristics were extracted to be included in the meta-analysis.Results: The present meta-analysis was conducted on 87 SARS-CoV-2 positive pregnant women. Almost 65% of the patients reported a history of exposure to an infected person, 78% suffered from mild or moderate COVID-19, 99.9% had successful termination, 86% had cough, and 68% had fever (p = .022 and p < .001). The overall proportions of vertical transmission, still birth, and neonatal death were zero, 0.002, and, 0.002, respectively (p = 1, p = .86, and p = .89, respectively). The means of the first- and fifth-minute Apgar scores were 8.86 and 9, respectively (p < .001 for both). The confounding role of history of underlying diseases with an estimated overall proportion of 33% (p = .03) resulted in further investigations due to sample size limitation. A natural history of COVID-19 pneumonia in the adult population was presented, as well.Conclusion: Currently, no evidence of vertical transmission has been suggested at least in late pregnancy. No hazards have been detected for fetuses or neonates. Although pregnant women are at an immunosuppressive state due to the physiological changes during pregnancy, most patients suffered from mild or moderate COVID-19 pneumonia with no pregnancy loss, proposing a similar pattern of the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia to that of other adult populations.","Kasraeian, Maryam; Zare, Marjan; Vafaei, Homeira; Asadi, Nasrin; Faraji, Azam; Bazrafshan, Khadijeh; Roozmeh, Shohreh",J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med,3,15

The effect and safety of Lopinavir/Ritonavir in combination with these therapies have seldom been studied. OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to evaluate changes in QTc in patients receiving double (Hydroxychloroquine + Azithromycin) and triple therapy (Hydroxychloroquine + Azithromycin + Lopinavir/Ritonavir) to treat COVID-19. Secondary outcome was the incidence of in-hospital all-cause mortality. METHODS: Patients under treatment with double (DT) and triple therapy (TT) for COVID-19 were consecutively included in this prospective observational study. Serial in-hospital electrocardiograms were performed to measure QTc at baseline and during therapy. RESULTS: 168 patients (±66.2 years old) were included: 32.1% received DT and 67.9% received TT. The mean baseline QTc was 410.33 ms. Patients under DT and TT prolonged QTc interval respect baseline values (p < 0.001), without significant differences between both therapy groups (p = 0.748). Overall, 33 patients (19.6%) had a peak QTc and/or an increase QTc 60 ms from baseline, with a higher prevalence among those with hypokalemia (p = 0.003). All-cause mortality was similar between both strategy groups (p = 0.093) and high risk QTc prolongation was no related to clinical events in this series. CONCLUSIONS: DT and TT prolong the QTc in patients with COVID-19. Addition of Lopinavir/Ritonavir on top of Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin did not increase QTc compared to DT.","Echarte-Morales, Julio; Minguito-Carazo, Carlos; Del Castillo-García, Samuel; Borrego-Rodríguez, Javier; Rodríguez-Santamarta, Miguel; Sánchez-Muñoz, Enrique; Bergel-García, Rubén; González-Maniega, Clea; Prieto-González, Silvia; Menéndez-Suarez, Paula; Tundidor-Sanz, Elena; Benito-González, Tomás; Fernández-Vázquez, Felipe",J Electrocardiol,3,20

The synthetic repurposing of drugs may prove to be more useful than the single repurposing in terms of reducing toxicity and enhancing efficacy. However, the researchers have not given it serious consideration. To address the issue, a novel datamining method is introduced and applied to repositioning of drugs for hypertension (HT) which is a serious medical condition and needs some improved treatment plans to help treat it. RESULTS: A novel two-step data mining method, which is based on the If-Then association rules as well as a novel discrete optimization algorithm, was introduced and applied to the synthetic repurposing of drugs for HT. The required data were also extracted from DrugBank, KEGG, and DrugR+ databases. The findings indicated that based on the different statistical criteria, the proposed method outperformed the other state-of-the-art approaches. In contrast to the previously proposed methods which had failed to discover a list on some datasets, our method could find a combination list for all of them. CONCLUSION: Since the proposed synthetic method uses medications in small dosages, it might revive some failed drug development projects and put forward a suitable plan for treating different diseases such as COVID-19 and HT. It is also worth noting that applying efficient computational methods helps to produce better results.","Masoudi-Sobhanzadeh, Yosef; Masoudi-Nejad, Ali",BMC Bioinformatics,3,21

The recent finding of some virus-neutralizing antibodies cross-reacting with brain tissue suggests the possible involvement of specific autoimmunity. DESIGN: Blood and CSF samples from eleven critically ill COVID-19 patients presenting with unexplained neurological symptoms including myoclonus, oculomotor disturbance, delirium, dystonia and epileptic seizures, were analyzed for anti-neuronal and anti-glial autoantibodies. RESULTS: Using cell-based assays and indirect immunofluorescence on unfixed murine brain sections, all patients showed anti-neuronal autoantibodies in serum or CSF. Antigens included intracellular and neuronal surface proteins, such as Yo or NMDA receptor, but also various specific undetermined epitopes, reminiscent of the brain tissue binding observed with certain human monoclonal SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. These included vessel endothelium, astrocytic proteins and neuropil of basal ganglia, hippocampus or olfactory bulb. CONCLUSION: The high frequency of autoantibodies targeting the brain in the absence of other explanations suggests a causal relationship to clinical symptoms, in particular to hyperexcitability (myoclonus, seizures). Several underlying autoantigens and their potential molecular mimicry with SARS-CoV-2 still await identification. However, autoantibodies may already now explain some aspects of multi-organ disease in COVID-19 and can guide immunotherapy in selected cases.","Franke, Christiana; Ferse, Caroline; Kreye, Jakob; Reincke, S Momsen; Sanchez-Sendin, Elisa; Rocco, Andrea; Steinbrenner, Mirja; Angermair, Stefan; Treskatsch, Sascha; Zickler, Daniel; Eckardt, Kai-Uwe; Dersch, Rick; Hosp, Jonas; Audebert, Heinrich J; Endres, Matthias; Ploner, J Christoph; Prüß, Harald",Brain behav. immun,3,16

OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical characteristics of COVID-19-associated skin manifestations, and explore the relationships between the six main cutaneous phenotypes and systemic findings. METHODS: Twenty-one Italian Dermatology Units were asked to collect the demographic, clinical and histopathological data of 200 patients with COVID-19-associated skin manifestations. The severity of COVID-19 was classified as asymptomatic, mild, moderate, or severe. RESULTS: A chilblain-like acral pattern significantly associated with a younger age (p<0.0001) and, after adjusting for age, significantly associated with less severe COVID-19 (p=0.0009). However, the median duration of chilblain-like lesions was significantly longer than that of the other cutaneous manifestations taken together (p <0.0001). Patients with moderate/severe COVID-19 were more represented than those with asymptomatic/mild COVID-19 among the patients with cutaneous manifestations other than chilblain-like lesions, but only the confluent erythematous/maculo-papular/morbilliform phenotype significantly associated with more severe COVID-19 (p=0.015), and this significance disappeared after adjusting for age. LIMITATIONS: Laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 was not possible in all cases.

COVID-19 is a disease characterized by a range of clinical syndromes including variable degrees of respiratory symptoms from mild respiratory illness and severe interstitial pneumonia to acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, coagulopathies, and multiorgan dysfunction. This virus carries the potential to manifest in a wide range of pulmonary findings and hypoxemias, from mild respiratory symptoms to more severe syndromes, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome. The rapid accumulation of evidence and persistent gaps in knowledge related to the virus presents a host of challenges for clinicians. This creates a complex environment for clinical decision-making. OBJECTIVE: To examine oxygenation strategies in critically ill patients with hypoxia who are hospitalized with COVID-19. DISCUSSION: These proposed strategies may help to improve the respiratory status and oxygenation of those affected by COVID-19. However, additional high-quality research is needed to provide further evidence for improved respiratory management strategies. Areas of future research should focus on improving understanding of the inflammatory and clotting processes associated with the virus, particularly in the lungs. High-level evidence and randomized controlled trials should target the most effective strategies for improving oxygenation, time requiring mechanical ventilation, and survival for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 presenting with hypoxemia.","Evers, Julianne M; Pehlke, Sarah J; Jones, Lauren L; Urquhart, Michelle G",Dimens Crit Care Nurs,3,21

A novel coronavirus, the so-called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was found to be responsible for this outbreak potentially originating from pangolins. In China, the outbreak lasted for 1 month until it seemed to be controlled after affecting over 81,000 individuals and causing deaths in over 4200 patients. Subsequently, and after affecting over 118,000 individuals and causing over 4200 deaths, the condition was officially announced as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). In the meantime, the epidemic curve took a downtrend in China, the original epicenter of the pandemic, but started to rise in other countries with a steep slope. Among over 215 affected countries, the USA, European countries (Italy, Germany, Spain, France, the UK), Iran, and South Korea had the highest frequencies in the matters of infected patients and deaths. Importantly, different countries took different policies when encountered with an outbreak, especially in the matter of accuracy of the report and timing of the action. A part of the delays in reporting was expected, including the lag in the chain of reporting, the shortcomings of tests, missed patients, and inadequate testing facilities. However, there were also political and nontechnical reasons that caused the reporting to be inaccurate. Surveillance seems to be less of a reason for the observed in poor management, and it mostly originated from human decision-making failures and political issues. Besides, the culture of populations and their trust in their governments played an important role on how they reacted to the COVID-19 pandemic and acquired policies. Finally, the characteristics of the world today indicate the danger of probable upcoming outbreaks, and policymakers should utilize the existing opportunities, particularly the advancements in technology and media, to prevent or adequately manage them.","Hanaei, Sara; Mohebi, Farnam; Moradi-Lakeh, Maziar; Jabbari, Parnian; Mehta, Surinder Kumar; Kryvenko, Liudmyla S; Luongo, Livio; Dupré, Lodc; Rezaei, Nima",Adv Exp Med Biol,3,1

Whilst accurately monitoring and forecasting air pollution are highly crucial, existing data-driven models fail to fully address the complex interaction between air pollution and urban dynamics. Our Deep-AIR, a novel hybrid deep learning framework that combines a convolutional neural network with a long short-term memory network, aims to address this gap to provide fine-grained city-wide air pollution estimation and station-wide forecast. Our proposed framework creates 1x1 convolution layers to strengthen the learning of cross-feature spatial interaction between air pollution and important urban dynamic features, particularly road density, building density/height, and street canyon effect.

Sediment samples were tested for the occurrence of microbial targets including molecular marker genes of enterococci (ENT), Bacteroides HF183 (HF183), Methanobrevibacter smithii (nifH), human adenovirus (HAdV) and emerging sewage-associated marker genes crAssphage (CPQ_056) and Lachnospiraceae (Lachno3) and animal feces-associated marker genes, including avian feces-associated Helicobacter spp. (GFD), canine-feces associated Bacteroides (DogBact), cattle-feces associated (cowM2) and horse feces-associated Bacteroides (HoF597). Results from this study showed that urban estuarine sediment can act as a reservoir of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) and several microbial source tracking (MST) marker genes, including previously unreported Lachno3. The sewage-associated marker gene CPQ_056 was most prevalent, in 63.8% of sediment samples, while the avian associated marker gene GFD had the highest mean abundance. The GFD marker gene was highly abundant and widely detected in sediment samples from all seven locations compared to the other animal feces-associated marker genes. In all, 31 (44.9%) sediment samples were positive for at least two sewage-associated marker genes. However, the non-quantifiable detection of the HAdV marker gene did not always align with the detection of two or more sewage-associated marker genes. In addition, the most frequent wet weather overflow exposure occurred at locations that did not have a consistent pattern of detection of the sewage-associated marker genes, suggesting sediments may not be a suitable measure of recent sewage contamination. To assist water quality and public health managers better understand past microbial contamination of estuarine sediment, further studies seem justified to explore the role of decay of MST marker genes in sediment. Further work is also needed on the role of resuspension of MST marker genes from sediment during storm events to the water column as a source of contamination for both the GFD and sewage-associated marker genes.","Ahmed, Warish; Payyappat, Sudhi; Cassidy, Michele; Harrison, Nathan; Marinoni, Oswald; Besley, Colin",Water Res,3,1

However, even though most of them were well evaluated, they still have difficulties with properly training their employees, which can be even a worse problem during a pandemic, when every precaution is extremely important to reduce the spread of the disease. Therefore, beyond this article contribution related to sustainability by demanding the hospitals to check which points of HCWM should be improved, it also adds academically by developing a tool with indicators that evaluate operational, human, economic and environmental factors in an innovative way.","de Aguiar Hugo, Andreza; Lima, Renato da Silva",Waste Manag Res,3,16

Its advantages include saving the time and money of the patients and the prevention of infection among healthcare providers. Objectives: In this study, we aim to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of telemedicine visits in providing postoperative care of neurosurgical patients. Materials and methods: We conducted this prospective study on 30 neurosurgical patients who were evaluated after surgery via telemedicine visits for 30 days. During the virtual visits, we discussed the clinical progress of patients, wound status, treatment modification, the time of return to work, postoperative complications, and the radiological data of the patients. All the patients were given an emergency number to call in case of urgent issues. The satisfaction of patients and doctors was measured with the aid of two questionnaires. Results: The patients’ age ranged from 18 to 65 years. Twenty patients were male and 10 patients were female. We performed 20 cranial operations and 10 spinal operations. Most patients needed more than 4 h to reach the hospital. The total number of telemedicine visits was 67 visits. We received about 62 emergency calls. Pain management, seizures control, wound infection, and hydrocephalus is among issues that were evaluated and managed via telemedicine visits. The overall satisfaction rate among patients and doctors was 90% and 95%, respectively. Conclusion: Virtual outpatient clinics seem to be a safe and effective way of postoperative care especially in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Ashry, Ahmed Hamdy; Alsawy, Mohamed Fathalla","Egypt.

Currently, there is only one FDA approved vaccine for the treatment of prostate cancer and as such prostate cancer continues to present a significant unmet medical need. In this study, we examine the effectiveness of a therapeutic cancer vaccine that combines the ISCOMATRIX&#8482; adjuvant (ISCOMATRIX) with the Toll-like receptor 3 agonist, polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (Poly I:C), and Flt3L, FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand. We employed the TRAMP-C1 (transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate) model of prostate cancer and the self-protein mPAP (prostatic acid phosphatase) as the tumor antigen. ISCOMATRIX&#8482;-mPAP-Poly I:C-Flt3L was delivered in a therapeutic prime-boost regime that was consistently able to achieve complete tumor regression in 60% of animals treated and these tumor-free animals were protected upon rechallenge. Investigations into the underlying immunological mechanisms contributing to the effectiveness of this vaccine identified that both innate and adaptive responses are elicited and required. NK cells, CD4+ T cells and interferon-Î³ were all found to be critical for tumor control while tumor infiltrating CD8+ T cells became disabled by an immunosuppressive microenvironment. There is potential for broader application of this cancer vaccine, as we have been able to demonstrate effectiveness in two additional cancer models; melanoma (B16-OVA) and a model of B cell lymphoma (Eµ-myc-GFP-OVA).","Barr, Adele M; Silva, Anabel; Prato, Sandro; Belz, Gabrielle T; Maraskovsky, Eugene; Baz Morelli, Adriana",,3,4

This basic rule would be useful especially when an outbreak is caused by a novel virus with its basic characteristics full of unknowns so much that there would be too many uncertainties that would be impossible for anyone to run the traditional epidemiological model meaningfully. The natural growth law does not depend on the detailed characteristics of the virus. When it is employed, a transmission rate can be defined and determined directly from clinical field data, which can change following the course of the epidemic development. Such a data driven natural growth model has been developed to track the development for any epidemic. It can yield useful information on the propagation pattern of the epidemic dynamically. The transmission rate so determined is sensitive enough not only to track the course of the epidemic but also to reveal the effects of control measures quantitatively. Importantly, it offers the potential to make predictions for epidemic management. In December 2019, a severe epidemic, the novel coronavirus epidemic, now designated as the COVID-19, broke out in Wuhan, China. It spread quickly in and around Wuhan. To complicate the situation, the outbreak initial period also coincided with the travel peak related with the Spring Festival. To prevent its spreading, Chinese government has instituted strict quarantine by lockdown the City and the surrounding Hubei Province. This drastic quarantine measure seemed to have slowed down the spread of the COVID-19 markedly. However, to evaluate the control effects quantitatively remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose to quantify the effectiveness of the quarantine using the natural growth model. Based on the model, we first estimated the transmission rates of the COVID-19 for different typical periods as follows: In December 2019, the transmission rate is about 0.26; in the late January 2020, it is between 0.40 and 0.46. Therefore, if the strict quarantine measures had not been instituted for the epidemic at all, 16.98 million to 76.11 million people would have been infected under the transmission rate between 0.40 and 0.46, as of February 18, 2020, according to the model. Even for a very low transmission rate as 0.26, there would have been 513 thousand infected as of February 18, 2020, far greater than the actual data of some 58 thousand reported by the Chinese National Health Commission. The model can also be used to estimate the consequence of putting off the control measures. We conducted a hypothetical study as follows. We divided the development of the epidemic into three stages: Before January 24, 2020, the infection grew as the actual situation does; from January 25, 2020 to the day before the supposed date of the start of the control measures, the infection grew with a transmission rate of 0.45; from the supposed date of the start of the control measure onwards, the infection took the actual transmission rate starting from January 25 on. Our model results indicate that the more days delayed for the quarantine measures, the faster increase of the infections. If the strict control measures were pushed back by one day (or 7 days), there would be 27 (or 785) thousand more infected cases than the reported as of February 18, 2020 in the whole China, in which 12 (or 493) thousand are in the Hubei Province. The above estimation is quite conservative. Less infected is easier to control; therefore, putting the measure control off we will have even more infected than estimated that would made the epidemic even harder to contain.","Wang, Gang; Huang, Norden E.; Qiao, Fangli",Kexue Tongbao/Chin.

The A and C types are found in significant proportions outside East Asia, that is, in Europeans and Americans. In contrast, the B type is the most common type in East Asia, and its ancestral genome appears not to have spread outside East Asia without first mutating into derived B types, pointing to founder effects or immunological or environmental resistance against this type outside Asia. The network faithfully traces routes of infections for documented coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases, indicating that phylogenetic networks can likewise be successfully used to help trace undocumented COVID-19 infection sources, which can then be quarantined to prevent recurrent spread of the disease worldwide.","Forster, Peter; Forster, Lucy; Renfrew, Colin; Forster, Michael",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,3,1

However, the effect of hypertension on outcomes of COVID-19 patients remains unclear. RESEARCH QUESTION: The aim of this study was to explore the effect of hypertension on the outcomes of patients with COVID-19 by using propensity score-matching (PSM) analysis. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Participants enrolled in this study were patients with COVID-19 who had been hospitalized at the Central Hospital of Wuhan, China. Chronic comorbidities and laboratory and radiological data were reviewed; patient outcomes and lengths of stay were obtained from discharge records. We used the Cox proportional-hazard model (CPHM) to analyze the effect of hypertension on these patients' outcomes and PSM analysis to further validate the abovementioned effect. RESULTS: A total of 226 patients with COVID-19 were enrolled in this study, of whom 176 survived and 50 died. The proportion of patients with hypertension among non-survivors was higher than that among survivors (26.70% vs. 74.00%; P < 0.001). Results obtained via CPHM showed that hypertension could increase risk of mortality in COVID-19 patients (hazard ratio 3.317; 95% CI [1.709-6.440]; P < 0.001). Increased D-dimer levels and higher ratio of neutrophils to lymphocytes (N/L) were also found to increase these patients' mortality risk. After matching on propensity score, we still came to similar conclusions. After we applied the same method in critically ill patients, we found that hypertension also increased risk of death in patients with severe COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Hypertension, increased D-dimer and the ratio of neutrophil to lymphocyte increased mortality in patients with COVID-19, with hypertension in particular.","Yang, Qing; Zhou, Ying; Wang, Xinrong; Gao, Shan; Xiao, Yang; Zhang, Weiming; Hu, Yi; Wang, Yafei",Respir Res,3,24

We sought to describe their natural history in previously hospitalised patients, compare this with controls, and assess the relationship between symptoms and cardiopulmonary impairment at 6 months post-COVID-19. MethodsFifty-eight patients and thirty matched controls underwent symptom-questionnaires, cardiac and lung magnetic resonance imaging (CMR), cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET), and spirometry at 3 months following COVID-19. Of them, forty-six patients returned for follow-up assessments at 6 months. FindingsAt 2-3 months, 83% of patients had at least one cardiopulmonary symptom versus 33% of controls. Patients and controls had comparable biventricular volumes and function. Native cardiac T1 (marker of inflammation) and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE, marker of focal fibrosis) were increased in patients. Sixty percent of patients had lung parenchymal abnormalities on CMR and 55% had reduced peak oxygen consumption (pVO2) on CPET. By 6 months, 53% of patients remained symptomatic. On CMR, indexed right ventricular (RV) end-diastolic volume (-4{middle dot}3 mls/m2, P=0{middle dot}005) decreased and RV ejection fraction (+3{middle dot}2%, P=0{middle dot}0003) increased. Native T1 and LGE improved and was comparable to controls. Lung parenchymal abnormalities and peak VO2, although better, were abnormal in patients versus controls. 31% had reduced pVO2 secondary to fatigue and submaximal tests. Cardiopulmonary symptoms in patients did not associate with CMR, lung function, or CPET measures. InterpretationIn patients, cardiopulmonary abnormalities improve over time, though some measures remain abnormal relative to controls.

However, engaging in these behaviors depends on the perception of the threat posed by the illness. Previous research shows the importance of illness perception in the case of communicable and non-communicable diseases, showing that they can change depending on the severity and risk attributed to them. Objective Compare the illness perception and the practice of preventive and exposure behavior based on the severity and the risk attributed to COVID-19 at the end of phase 1 and the beginning of phase 2 of the pandemic in Mexico. Method By means of a chain sampling, a comparative study was conducted in which an evaluation battery was disseminated through e-mail and social networks. Results It was found that evaluating COVID-19 as a serious disease and perceiving oneself as being at risk of contracting it had small and moderate effects on the perception of the consequences of the illness (r = .34; r = .26), emotional impact (r = .32; r = .25), personal control (r = .24) and engagement in preventive (r = .05), and exposure behaviors (r = .07; r = .07). Discussion and conclusion This article shows the relevance of the perceptual variables that impact concern due to the social and emotional consequences of COVID-19, as well as those that encourage preventive behaviors and the minimization of exposure behavior.","Lugo-González, Isaías Vicente; Fernández-Vega, Margarita; Reynoso-Erazo, Leonardo; Becerra-Gálvez, Ana Leticia; Pérez-Bautista, Yuma Yoaly",Salud ment,3,16

Therefore, the purpose of this review was to identify relevant peer-reviewed literature in this area to thematically produce evidence-based recommendations that would inform community planning and response amongst homeless populations. Although this review is inspired by the COVID-19 pandemic, our intention was to produce relevant recommendations to for all current and future outbreaks and pandemics more generally. Our search criteria focused on pandemics and rapid-spread illnesses such as contagious respiratory diseases with contact spread and with an emphasis on individuals experiencing homelessness. Content analysis methods were followed to extract and thematically synthesise key information amongst the 223 articles that matched our search criteria between the years of 1984 and 2020. Two reviewers were assigned to the screening process and used Covidence and undertook two rounds of discussion to identify and finalise themes for extraction. This review illustrates that the current breadth of academic literature on homeless populations has thus far focused on tuberculosis (TB) rather than diseases that are more recent and closely related to COVID-19-such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) or H1N1. Our thematic content analysis revealed six themes that offer tangible and scalable recommendations which include (1) education and outreach, (2) adapting structure of services, (3) screening and contract tracing, (4) transmission and prevention strategies, (5) shelter protocols and (6) treatment, adherence and vaccination. The breadth and depth of reviews such as these are dependent on the quantity and quality of the available literature. Therefore, the limited existing literature outside of tuberculosis specific to homelessness in this review illustrates a need for more academic research into the intersections of pandemics and homelessness-particularly for evaluations of response and planning. Nonetheless, this review offers timely considerations for pandemic response and planning amongst homeless populations during the current COVID-19 pandemic and can facilitate future research in this area.","Babando, Jordan; Quesnel, Danika A; Woodmass, Kyler; Lomness, Arielle; Graham, John R",Heal. soc. care community,3,2

As a result, individuals lost their social relationships, leading to social isolation and loneliness. Both social isolation and loneliness are major risk factors for poor physical and mental health status through enhanced chronic inflammation; however, there might be an interplay between social isolation and loneliness on the association with chronic inflammation. We aimed to clarify the link between social relationships and inflammation in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic by distinguishing whether social isolation only, loneliness only, or both were associated with chronic inflammation markers among community-dwelling adults. The data of 624 people (aged 18-92 years, mean 51.4) from the Utsunomiya COVID-19 seROprevalence Neighborhood Association (U-CORONA) study, which targeted randomly sampled households in Utsunomiya city, Japan, were analyzed. Social isolation was assessed as a structural social network by asking the number of social roles they have on a daily basis. Loneliness was measured with the UCLA loneliness scale. As chronic inflammation biomarkers, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and the concentration of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured. Generalized estimating equations method was employed to take into account the correlations within households. Isolated-Lonely condition (i.e., being both socially isolated and feeling lonely) was associated with higher NLR among men (B = 0.141, 95%CI = -0.01 to 0.29). Interestingly, Nonisolated-Lonely condition (i.e., not socially isolated but feeling lonely) was associated with lower CRP among women (B = -0.462, 95%CI = -0.82 to -0.10) and among the working-age population (B = -0.495, 95%CI = -0.76 to -0.23). In conclusion, being both socially isolated and feeling lonely was associated with chronic inflammation.

This article argues these diaries constitute a kind of performance art for their authors, specifically, an 'art of endurance' as described by Shalson (2018). Keeping a diary requires a plan, but the following through of the plan is a contingent process requiring efforts and endurance. The challenges become particularly daunting for authors of online diaries in pandemic times. The article analyzes multiple types of endurance associated with the Wuhan lockdown diarists, showing that in digitally-driven environments, where potential collective responses are a key context, the lockdown diaries of Wuhan, like works of endurance art, engage with meanings that reach far beyond their original experience and context. Their stories of endurance are an allegory of the endurance of the entire city of Wuhan.","Yang, Guobin",AI Soc,3,16

We continued our SIV effectiveness against medically-attended influenza-like illness (ILI) under the Department of Health Hong Kong's sentinel private medical practitioners (PMP) network, using the test-negative case-control design, for the 2018/19 and 2019/20 season. In addition, we studied the potential interference between SIV and ILI caused by non-influenza respiratory viruses (NIRV) based on data collated from 2017/18 to 2019/20 seasons. 3404 patients were analysed. Across the 2017/18 to 2019/20 seasons, the vaccine effectiveness (VE) of SIV was 44% (95% CI 30-56%) against pan-negative controls, 57% (95%CI: 42-68%) against NIRV controls and 50% (95%CI 38-59%) against both. SIV was moderately effective against medically-attended ILI caused by influenza A/B in both 2018/19 and 2019/20 winter seasons (53.2% (95%CI 36.7-65.5%) and 41.8% (95%CI 6.3-64.1%), respectively). The VE against the main circulating subtype, influenza A(H1), was higher for the 2018/19 season (57.2% (95%CI 39.8-69.9%), compared to 34.6% (95%CI -9.6-61.4%) in the 2019/20 season). When compared to pan negative controls, those with single NIRV infections were similarly likely to have received SIV (OR 1.05 (95%CI 0.72-1.54) within the influenza season; OR 0.97 (95%CI 0.73-1.29) when including non-influenza seasons). Analyses by type of virus showed no increased risk of SIV identified among those with single infections of EV/RV, HMPV and parainfluenza but a 2-fold increased risk was shown for those with single infections of adenovirus and parainfluenza virus (adenovirus: OR 2.54 (95%CI 1.24-5.14) within influenza season and OR 1.78 (95%CI 1.01-3.09) for the whole period; parainfluenza virus: OR 2.01 (95%CI 1.22-3.29) within influenza season and OR 1.89 (95%CI 1.29-2.76) for the whole period).

RESEARCH QUESTION: What are the mental health symptoms in healthcare providers (HCPs) facing the second wave? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Cross-sectional study (October 30-December 1, 2020) in sixteen ICUs during the second wave in France. HCPs completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R, for posttraumatic stress disorder), and the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI). RESULTS: There were 845/1203 (70%) respondents (66% nursing staff, 32% medical staff, 2% other professionals); 487 (57.6%) had managed more than ten new COVID-19 patients in the previous week. Insomnia affected 320 (37.9%) and 7.7% were taking a psychotropic drug daily. Symptoms of anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and burnout were reported in 60.0% [95%CI, 56.6-63.3%], 36.1% [32.9-39.5%], 28.4% [25.4-31.6%], and 45.1% [41.7-48.5%] of respondents, respectively. Independent predictors of such symptoms included respondent characteristics (sex, profession, experience, personality traits), work organization (ability to rest and to care for family), and self-perceptions (fear of getting infected or infecting family and friends, feeling pressure related to the surge, intention to leave the ICU, lassitude, working conditions, feeling they had a high risk profession, and missing the clapping). The number of COVID-19 patients managed in the first wave or over the last week was not associated with symptoms of mental health disorders. INTERPRETATION: The prevalence of symptoms of mental health disorders is high in ICU HCPs managing the second COVID-19 surge. The highest tiers of hospital management urgently need to provide psychological support, peer-support groups, and a communication structure that ensure the well-being of HCPs.","Azoulay, Elie; Cariou, Alain; Bruneel, Fabrice; Demoule, Alexandre; Kouatchet, Achille; Reuter, Danielle; Klouche, Kada; Argaud, Laurent; Barbier, François; Jourdain, Mercé; Reignier, Jean; Papazian, Laurent; Resche-Rigon, Matthieu; Guisset, Olivier; Labbé, Vincent; Van Der Meersch, Guillaume; Guitton, Christophe",Chest,3,18

METHODS: We enrolled consecutive patients with MRI-defined lacunar stroke who presented within 12 hours after symptom onset from a prospective stroke database (2015-2019). END was defined as any persisting increase in National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of &#8805;2 points within 24 hours after admission and favorable outcome as modified Rankin Scale (mRS) of 0-2 at 90 days. We assessed the association of END with clinical and imaging variables, acute treatment and outcome using multivariable regression, calculating adjusted odds ratios. RESULTS: Sixty-one of 365 (16.7%) patients with acute lacunar stroke (median age 71.8 years, 39.5% female, median NIHSS score on admission 3) had END. Lower NIHSS score on admission (per point, aOR 0.81, p=0.006), capsular warning syndrome (aOR 7.00, p<0.001), ventral pontine infarct (aOR 3.49, p=0.008) and hypoperfusion on imaging (aOR 2.13, p=0.026) were associated with END. Acute dual antiplatelet therapy was associated with reduced risk of END (aOR 0.10, p=0.04). Patients with END had less favorable outcome at 90 days (aOR 0.13 p<0.001), but intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) was associated with favorable outcome at 90 days (aOR 3.95, p=0.002). CONCLUSION: One in six patients with lacunar stroke has END and patients at high risk of END can be identified using radiological and clinical variables. Targeted therapeutic trials for this population seem justified. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class II evidence that early neurologic deterioration in patients with acute lacunar stroke predicts poorer functional outcome at 90 days as determined by the modified Rankin Scale.","Vynckier, Jan; Maamari, Basel; Grunder, Lorenz; Goeldlin, Martina Béatrice; Meinel, Thomas Raphael; Kaesmacher, Johannes; Hakim, Arsany; Arnold, Marcel; Gralla, Jan; Seiffge, David Julian; Fischer, Urs",Neurology,3,30

METHODS: A total of 370 patients with COVID-19 were consecutively enrolled at The Third People's Hospital of Yichang from January to March 2020. COVID-19 was diagnosed according to the COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment plan released by the National Health and Health Committee of China. Effect-size estimates are summarized as odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: 326 patients were diagnosed with mild or ordinary COVID-19, and 44 with severe or critical COVID-19. After propensity score matching and statistical adjustment, eight factors were significantly associated with severe or critical COVID-19 (p <0.05) relative to mild or ordinary COVID-19. Due to strong pairwise correlations, only five factors, including diagnostic delay (OR, 95% CI, p: 1.08, 1.02 to 1.17, 0.048), albumin (0.82, 0.75 to 0.91, <0.001), lactate dehydrogenase (1.56, 1.14 to 2.13, 0.011), white blood cell (1.27, 1.08 to 1.50, 0.004), and neutrophil (1.40, 1.16 to 1.70, <0.001), were retained for model construction and performance assessment. The nomogram model based on the five factors had good prediction capability and accuracy (C-index: 90.6%). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide evidence for the significant contribution of five independent factors to the risk of severe or critical COVID-19, and their prediction was reinforced in a nomogram model.","Chen, Xin; Peng, Feng; Zhou, Xiaoni; Zhu, Jiang; Gong, Yingying; Shupeng, Wang; Niu, Wenquan",Aging (Albany NY),3,14

Each node represents a bank and is associated to a probability of default per unit time (PD) that depends on its capital and is increased by the default of neighbouring nodes. Governments can control the systemic risk of the network by providing additional capital to the banks, lowering their PD at the expense of an increased exposure in case of their failure.

Because nuclear factor kappa B (NF-Ä¸B) is at the bottom of many inflammatory conditions, methods to evaluate the net effect of inflammation modulators on this master regulator have been conceptualized for years. METHODS: Using an ex vivo NF-Ä¸B reporter cell line-based assay, plasma samples of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (n = 27), psoriasis (n = 15), or severe coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) (n = 21) were investigated for NF-Ä¸B activation compared to plasma samples from 9 healthy volunteers. RESULTS: When separated by C-reactive protein (CRP) threshold levels, samples of patients exhibiting increased CRP levels (&#8805;5 mg/l) activated NF-Ä¸B more efficiently than samples from patients with levels below 5 mg/l (P = 0.0001) or healthy controls (P = 0.04). Overall, there was a moderate association of CRP levels with NF-Ä¸B activation (Spearman r = 0.66; p < 0.0001). Plasma from COVID-19 patients activated NF-Ä¸B more efficiently (mean 2.4-fold compared to untreated reporter cells) than samples from any other condition (healthy controls, 1.8-fold, P = 0.0025; rheumatoid arthritis, 1.7-fold, P < 0.0001; psoriasis, 1.7-fold, P < 0.0001). In contrast, effects of rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, or healthy volunteer samples did not differ. CONCLUSION: This study shows that a NF-Ä¸B reporter cell line can be used to evaluate the net inflammatory effect of clinical plasma samples. Patients with chronic but stable rheumatoid arthritis or psoriasis do not exhibit increased plasma levels of NF-Ä¸B-activating compounds as opposed to COVID-19 patients with high inflammatory burden.","Wagner, Lelia; Haefeli, Walter E; Merle, Uta; Lorenz, Hanns-Martin; Hohmann, Nicolas; Weiss, Johanna; Theile, Dirk",Cytokine,3,33

METHODS: AgNPs were synthesized using the ethnobotanical product gum Arabic. It influenced the nanoparticles with medicinal value through their role as capping, stabilizing, or surface-attached components. The biophysical characteristics of the synthesized AgNPs were studied using UV-vis spectrum, XRD, EDAX, SEM, and TEM tools. The AgNPs were spherical with the average size less than 10 nm. By using the well diffusion and microdilution techniques, the impact of synthesized AgNPs was tested against S. mutans isolates. RESULTS: The smaller the size, the greater the antibacterial and antiviral potential the particles exhibit. The biophysical characteristics of AgNPs the presence of phenols, alcohols, amides, sulfoxide, flavanoids, terpenoids and steroids. The AgNPs exhibited a good antibacterial action against the oral pathogen S. mutans. The synthesized NPs at a dose level of 200 µg/mL exhibited an inhibition zone with 18.30 ± 0.5 nm diameter. The synthesised nanoparticles inhibited the genes responsible for biofilm formation of S. mutans over host tooth and gums (gtfB, gtfc, gtfD) and virulent protective factors (comDE, brpA and smu 360) and survival promoter genes (gyrA and spaP, gbpB). CONCLUSION: The potent antibiotic action over S. mutans seen with the synthesized NPs, paves the way for the development of novel dental care products.

The infection presents a wide range of symptoms mainly at the gastrointestinal and urogenital level. Cases of schistosomiasis-related appendicitis are seldom reported. The aim of the present study is to identify the prevalence of schistosomiasis-related appendicitis in Beira, Mozambique and compare to global prevalence. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed all cases of appendicitis recorded from January 2017 to March 2020 at a single pathology department located in Beira in order to assess the prevalence of schistosomiasis. Moreover, we performed a systematic review on the prevalence of schistosomiasis-related appendicitis in all countries. FINDINGS: A total of 145 appendicitis cases in Beira showed a 13.1% prevalence of schistosomal-related appendicitis. The mean age of patients was 29.1 years, and 14 (73.7%) were male. The systematic review identified 20 studies with 34,790 inpatients with schistosomiasis-related appendicitis with a global prevalence of 1.31% (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.72 to 2.06); a high heterogeneity (I2 = 96.0%) was observed. Studies carried out in Africa reported a significantly higher prevalence of schistosomiasis-related appendicitis (2.75%; 95% CI: 1.28 to 4.68) than those in Middle East (0.49%; 95% CI: 0.18 to 0.95) (p for interaction < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Schistosomiasis infection should be considered as possible cause of appendicitis not only in endemic areas but also in developed countries. Considering that prevention is the best way to control the infection, more efforts should be put in place in order to increase the prevention coverage and avoid the cascading implications for health. This is even more so important in this Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) era where the majority of attention and funds are used to fight the pandemic.","Zacarias, Mateus; Pizzol, Damiano; de Miranda, Helder; Colangelo, Anna Claudia; Veronese, Nicola; Smith, Lee",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,3,16

Four AR stimuli were developed: a plastic bag full of garbage, a piece of bread with mold, a dirty sports shoe, and a piece of rotten meat. All stimuli were shown to a clinical group (17 patients with cleaning OCD) and a control group (11 patients without OCD). Relevant results were the design of the AR stimuli. These stimuli were validated with the statistical difference in perceived anxiety in the meat stimuli between the clinical and control groups. Nevertheless, when looking at effect sizes, all stimuli present effect sizes from small (plastic bag) to large (meat), with both shoe and bread between small and medium effect sizes.

At that time, there were reports of heroic acts among professionals who cared for these patients, whose bravery and professionalism were highly praised. However, there are concerns about changes in new generation of nursing professionals. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to examine the attitude of nursing students, should they be faced with severe acute respiratory syndrome patients during their future work. RESEARCH DESIGN: A questionnaire survey was carried out to examine the attitude among final-year nursing students to three ethical areas, namely, duty of care, resource allocation, and collateral damage. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS: This study was carried out in accordance with the requirements and recommendations of the Central Research and Ethics Committee, School of Health Sciences at Caritas Institute of Higher Education. FINDINGS: Complete responses from 102 subjects were analyzed. The overwhelming majority (96.1%) did not agree to participate in the intubation of severe acute respiratory syndrome patients if protective measures, that is, N95 mask and gown, were not available. If there were insufficient N95 masks for all the medical, nursing, and allied health workers in the hospital (resource allocation), 37.3% felt that the distribution of N95 masks should be by casting lot, while the rest disagreed. When asked about collateral damage, more than three-quarters (77.5%) said that severe acute respiratory syndrome patients should be admitted to intensive care unit. There was sex difference in nursing students' attitude toward severe acute respiratory syndrome care during pregnancy and influence of age in understanding intensive care unit care for these patients. Interestingly, 94.1% felt that there should be a separate intensive care unit for severe acute respiratory syndrome patients. CONCLUSION: As infection control practice and isolation facilities improved over the years, relevant knowledge and nursing ethical issues related to infectious diseases should become part of nursing education and training programs, especially in preparation for outbreaks of infectious diseases or distress.","Kam, Joseph Km; Chan, Eric; Lee, Albert; Wei, Vivian Wi; Kwok, Kin On; Lui, Dominic; Yuen, Robert Kn",Nurs Ethics,3,30

Toutefois, le risque d’infection lors de l’hospitalisation et ses conséquences sont encore très peu connus. Le but de ce travail était de rapporter une série de patients hospitalisés en chirurgie digestive chez qui une infection nosocomiale à SARS-Cov-2 a été diagnostiquée. Méthodes: Etude rétrospective non-interventionnelle réalisée au sein de 3 services de chirurgie digestive. Les données cliniques, biologiques et radiologiques des patients ayant développé une infection nosocomiale au SARS-Cov-2 ont été collectées à partir des dossiers informatisés. Résultats: Du 1er Mars 2020 au 5 Avril 2020, parmi 305 patients admis en chirurgie digestive, 15 (4.9%) ont présenté une infection nosocomiale à SARS-Cov-2. Il s’agissait de 9 hommes et 6 femmes, d’un âge médian de 62 ans (35-68 ans). Tous les patients présentaient une comorbidité. Les motifs d’hospitalisation étaient : traitement chirurgical d’un cancer (n=5), urgences complexes (n=5), traitement de complications liées au cancer ou à son traitement (n=3), reconstruction par gastroplastie (n=1), fermeture de stomie (n=1).

Conclusions: Le risque d’infection au SARS-Cov-2 au cours d’une hospitalisation ou dans les suites d’une intervention de chirurgie digestive est un risque réel et potentiellement grave. Des mesures sont nécessaires afin de minimiser ce risque dans la perspective d’une reprise de l’activité chirurgicale en toute sécurité. SUMMARY Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic imposed a drastic reduction in surgical activity in order to respond to the influx of hospital patients and to protect uninfected patients by avoiding hospitalization. However, little is known about the risk of infection during hospitalization or its consequences. The aim of this work was to report a series of patients hospitalized on digestive surgery services who developed a nosocomial infection with SARS-Cov-2 virus. Methods: This is a non-interventional retrospective study carried out within three departments of digestive surgery. The clinical, biological and radiological data of the patients who developed a nosocomial infection with SARS-Cov-2 were collected from the computerized medical record. Results: From March 1, 2020 to April 5, 2020, among 305 patients admitted to digestive surgery services, 15 (4.9%) developed evident nosocomial infection with SARS-Cov-2. There were nine men and six women, with a median age of 62 years (35-68 years). All patients had co-morbidities. The reasons for hospitalization were: surgical treatment of cancer (n = 5), complex emergencies (n = 5), treatment of complications linked to cancer or its treatment (n = 3), gastroplasty (n = 1), and stoma closure (n = 1). The median time from admission to diagnosis of SARS-Cov-2 infection was 34 days (5-61 days). In 12 patients (80%), the diagnosis was made after a hospital stay of more than 14 days (15-63 days). At the end of the follow-up, two patients had died, seven were hospitalized with two of them on respiratory assistance, and six patients were discharged post-hospitalization. Conclusions: The risk of SARS-Cov-2 infection during hospitalization or following digestive surgery is a real and potentially serious risk. Measures are necessary to minimize this risk in order to return to safe surgical activity.","Luong-Nguyen, Minh; Hermand, Hélène; Abdalla, Solafah; Cabrit, Nicolas; Hobeika, Christian; Brouquet, Antoine; Goéré, Diane; Sauvanet, Alain",Journal de chirurgie viscerale,3,5

If bats in close interaction with humans host and shed coronaviruses with zoonotic potential, such as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome virus, spillover may occur. Therefore, strategies aiming to mitigate potential spillover and disease emergence, while supporting the conservation of bats and their important ecological roles are needed. Past research suggests that coronavirus shedding in bats varies seasonally following their reproductive cycle; however, shedding dynamics have been assessed in only a few species, which does not allow for generalization of findings across bat taxa and geographic regions. METHODS: To assess the generalizability of coronavirus shedding seasonality, we sampled hundreds of bats belonging to several species with different life history traits across East Africa at different times of the year. We assessed, via Bayesian modeling, the hypothesis that chiropterans, across species and spatial domains, experience seasonal trends in coronavirus shedding as a function of the reproductive cycle. RESULTS: We found that, beyond spatial, taxonomic, and life history differences, coronavirus shedding is more expected when pups are becoming independent from the dam and that juvenile bats are prone to shed these viruses. CONCLUSIONS: These findings could guide policy aimed at the prevention of spillover in limited-resource settings, where longitudinal surveillance is not feasible, by identifying high-risk periods for coronavirus shedding. In these periods, contact with bats should be avoided (for example, by impeding or forbidding people access to caves). Our proposed strategy provides an alternative to culling – an ethically questionable practice that may result in higher pathogen levels – and supports the conservation of bats and the delivery of their key ecosystem services.","Montecino-Latorre, Diego; Goldstein, Tracey; Gilardi, Kirsten; Wolking, David; Van Wormer, Elizabeth; Kazwala, Rudovick; Ssebide, Benard; Nziza, Julius; Sijali, Zikankuba; Cranfield, Michael; Mazet, Jonna A.

Metagenomics as pathogen agnostic approach can result in additional etiological findings, however the exact diagnostic yield when used as a secondary test remains unknown. AREAS COVERED: This review aims to highlight recent advances with regard to wet and dry lab methodologies of metagenomic testing and technical milestones that have been achieved. A selection of procedures currently applied in accredited diagnostic laboratories is described in more detail to illustrate best practices. Furthermore, a meta-analysis was performed to assess the additional diagnostic yield utilizing metagenomic sequencing in meningoencephalitis patients. Finally, the remaining challenges for successful widespread implementation of metagenomic sequencing for the diagnosis of meningoencephalitis are addressed in a future perspective. EXPERT OPINION: The last decade has shown major advances in technical possibilities for using mNGS in diagnostic settings including cloud-based analysis. An additional advance may be the current established infrastructure of platforms for bioinformatic analysis of SARS-CoV-2, which may assist to pave the way for global use of clinical metagenomics.","Carbo, Ellen C; Blankenspoor, Ivar; Goeman, Jelle J; Kroes, Aloys C M; Claas, Eric C J; de Vries, Jutte J C",Expert rev. mol. diagn,3,20

As such, the Internet information can simulate expert medical doctors, pharmacists, and other health care providers. AIM: This article aims to evaluate a dataset of search terms to determine whether search queries and terms can be used to reliably predict skin disease breakouts. Furthermore, the authors propose and evaluate a model to decide when to declare a particular month as Epidemic at the US national level. METHODS: A Model was designed to distinguish a breakout in skin diseases based on the number of monthly discovered cases. To apply this model, the authors correlated Google Trends of popular search terms with monthly reported Rubella and Measles cases from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Regressions and decision trees were used to determine the impact of different terms to trigger the occurrence of epidemic classes. RESULTS: Results showed that the volume of search keywords for Rubella and Measles rises when the volume of those reported diseases rises. Results also implied that the overall process was successful and should be repeated with other diseases. Such process can trigger different actions or activities to be taken when a certain month is declared as “Epidemic.” Furthermore, this research has shown great interest for vaccination against Measles and Rubella. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that the search queries and keyword trends can be truly reliable to be used for the prediction of disease outbreaks and some other related knowledge extraction applications. Also search-term surveillance can provide an additional tool for infectious disease surveillance. Future research needs to re-apply the model used in this article, and researchers need to question whether characterizing the epidemiology of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic waves in United States can be done through search queries and keyword trends.","Obeidat, Rand; Alsmadi, Izzat; Bani Bakr, Qanita; Obeidat, Laith",Infect Dis (Auckl),3,24

We focus primarily on food products but show our results extend to non-food products that are natural (i.e., originate from plants, animals, or humans). We propose that, in addition to its physical function, packaging acts as a symbolic barrier that separates the product from nature, decreasing perceived product naturalness and leading to less favorable product responses. Consistent with our theorizing, the negative effects of packaging attenuate when product information or retail signage highlights the product’s connection to nature and are contingent on the importance of product naturalness. Our findings have implications for strategic use of packaging in physical and digital merchandising and sustainability initiatives aimed at reducing packaging.

Lung cancer patients are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The SARS-CoV-2 enters into the host by the ACE2 receptor. Thus, ACE2 is the key to understand the mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the lack of knowledge about the biomarker of COVID-19 warrants the development of ACE2 biomarkers. The analysis of ACE2 expression in lung cancer was performed using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Therefore, we investigated the prognosis, clinical characteristics, and mutational analysis of lung cancer. We also analyzed the shared proteins between the COVID-19 and lung cancer, protein-protein interactions, gene-miRNAs, gene-transcription factors (TFs), and the signaling pathway. Finally, we compared the mRNA expression of ACE2 and its co-expressed proteins using the TCGA. The up-regulation of ACE2 in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous carcinoma (LUSC) was found irrespective of gender and age. We found the low survival rate in high expression of ACE2 in lung cancer patients and 16 mutational positions. The functional assessment of targeted 12,671, 3107, and 29 positive genes were found in COVID-19 disease, LUAD, and LUSC, respectively. Then, we identified eight common genes that interact with 20 genes, 219 miRNAs, and 16 TFs. The common genes performed the mRNA expression in lung cancer, which proved the ACE2 is the best potential biomarker compared to co-expressed genes.

This task requires identifying footprints of local selection but also estimating spatio‐temporal variations in population demography and variations in recombination rate and in diversity along the genome. Here, we investigated these parameters in blue tit populations inhabiting deciduous versus evergreen forests, and insular versus mainland areas, in the context of a previously described strong phenotypic differentiation. Neighboring population pairs of deciduous and evergreen habitats were weakly genetically differentiated (F (ST) = 0.003 on average), nevertheless with a statistically significant effect of habitat type on the overall genetic structure. This low differentiation was consistent with the strong and long‐lasting gene flow between populations inferred by demographic modeling. In turn, insular and mainland populations were moderately differentiated (F (ST) = 0.08 on average), in line with the inference of moderate ancestral migration, followed by isolation since the end of the last glaciation. Effective population sizes were large, yet smaller on the island than on the mainland. Weak and nonparallel footprints of divergent selection between deciduous and evergreen populations were consistent with their high connectivity and the probable polygenic nature of local adaptation in these habitats. In turn, stronger footprints of divergent selection were identified between long isolated insular versus mainland birds and were more often found in regions of low recombination, as expected from theory. Lastly, we identified a genomic inversion on the mainland, spanning 2.8 Mb. These results provide insights into the demographic history and genetic architecture of local adaptation in blue tit populations at multiple geographic scales.","Perrier, Charles; Rougemont, Quentin; Charmantier, Anne",Evol Appl,3,20

However, associations between actual policies and temporal behavior changes have remained underexplored. To fill this important research gap, a nationwide retrospective life-oriented panel survey on individuals' behavior changes from April to September 2020 was implemented in Japan. Reliability of information sources, risk perceptions, and attitudes toward policymaking were also investigated. Valid data were collected from 2643 respondents residing in different parts of the country. Risks were reported about general infections and public transport use. Attitudes toward policymaking were mainly about policymaking capacity and PASS-LASTING based policy measures. A dynamic structural equation model (DSEM) was developed to quantify dynamic associations between individuals’ behavior changes over time and subjective assessments (i.e., attitudes) of policymaking. Survey results revealed that behavior changes are mostly characterized by avoidance behaviors. Modeling estimation results showed a statistically-significant sequential cause-effect relationship between accumulated behavior changes in the past, subjective factors, and the most recent behavior changes. The most recent behavior changes are mostly affected by accumulated behavior changes in the past. Effects of subjective assessments of policymaking on the most recent behavior changes are significant but moderate. Among attitudes toward policymaking, attitudes toward policymaking capacity are more influential than willingness to follow PASS-LASTING based policy measures. High risks of using public transport are found to significantly influence the most recent behavior changes, together with other risk perception factors. Insights into effective COVID-19 policymaking are summarized.","Ding, Hongxiang; Zhang, Junyi",Transp Policy (Oxf),3,11

The vulnerable sections of our community, including the elderly, those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, those with multiple comorbidities, and immunocompromised patients, endure a relatively higher burden of a pandemic such as COVID-19. The rapid adoption of different technologies across countries, driven by the need to provide continued medical care in the era of social distancing, has catalyzed the penetration of telemedicine. Limiting the exposure of patients, healthcare workers, and systems is critical in controlling the viral spread. Telemedicine offers an opportunity to improve health systems delivery, access, and efficiency.

Sequence analysis of SARS-coronavirus isolates revealed that specific genotypes predominated at different periods of the epidemic. This information can be used as a footprint for tracing the epidemiology of infections and monitor viral evolution. However, direct sequencing analysis of a large number of clinical samples is cumbersome and time consuming. We present here a simple and rapid assay for the screening of SARS-coronavirus genotypes based on the use of fluorogenic oligonucleotide probes for allelic discrimination. METHODS: Thirty SARS patients were recruited. Allelic discrimination assays were developed based on the use of fluorogenic oligonucleotide probes (TaqMan). Genotyping of the SARS-coronavirus isolates obtained from these patients were carried out by the allelic discrimination assays and confirmed by direct sequencing. RESULTS: Genotyping based on the allelic discrimination assays were fully concordant with direct sequencing. All of the 30 SARS-coronavirus genotypes studied were characteristic of genotypes previously documented to be associated with the latter part of the epidemic. Seven of the isolates contained a previously reported major deletion but in patients not epidemiologically related to the previously studied cohort. CONCLUSION: We have developed a simple and accurate method for the characterization and screening of SARS-coronavirus genotypes. It is a promising tool for the study of epidemiological relationships between documented cases during an outbreak.","Chung, Grace TY; Chiu, Rossa WK; Cheung, Jo LK; Jin, Yongjie; Chim, Stephen SC; Chan, Paul KS; Lo, YM Dennis",BMC Infect Dis,3,1

It consists in reducing social interactions. This is taken into account by the introduction of a factor of reduction of social interactions q, and by decreasing the transmission coefficient of the disease accordingly. Evaluating q is a difficult question and one can ask if it makes sense to compute an average coefficient q for a given population, in order to make predictions on the basic reproduction rate R0, the dynamics of the epidemic or the fraction of the population that will have been infected by the end of the epidemic. On a very simple example, we show that the computation of R0 in a heterogeneous population is not reduced to the computation of an average q but rather to the direct computation of an average coefficient R0. Even more interesting is the fact that, in a range of data compatible with the Covid-19 outbreak, the size of the epidemic is deeply modified by social heterogeneity, as is the height of the epidemic peak, while the date at which it is reached mainly depends on the average R0 coefficient.","Dolbeault, J.; TURINICI, G.",,3,16

Recent advances in experimental techniques have enabled sequencing of TCRs and their antigenic targets (epitopes), allowing to research the missing link between TCR sequence and epitope binding specificity. Scarcity of data and a large sequence space make this task challenging, and to date only models limited to a small set of epitopes have achieved good performance. Here, we establish a k-nearest-neighbor (K-NN) classifier as a strong baseline and then propose Tcr epITope bimodal Attention Networks (TITAN), a bimodal neural network that explicitly encodes both TCR sequences and epitopes to enable the independent study of generalization capabilities to unseen TCRs and/or epitopes. RESULTS: By encoding epitopes at the atomic level with SMILES sequences, we leverage transfer learning and data augmentation to enrich the input data space and boost performance. TITAN achieves high performance in the prediction of specificity of unseen TCRs (ROC-AUC 0.87 in 10-fold CV) and surpasses the results of the current state-of-the-art (ImRex) by a large margin. Notably, our Levenshtein-based K-NN classifier also exhibits competitive performance on unseen TCRs. While the generalization to unseen epitopes remains challenging, we report two major breakthroughs. First, by dissecting the attention heatmaps, we demonstrate that the sparsity of available epitope data favors an implicit treatment of epitopes as classes. This may be a general problem that limits unseen epitope performance for sufficiently complex models. Second, we show that TITAN nevertheless exhibits significantly improved performance on unseen epitopes and is capable of focusing attention on chemically meaningful molecular structures. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The code as well as the dataset used in this study is publicly available at https://github.com/PaccMann/TITAN.

Mathematical models have played an important role in many key policy discussions about COVID-19. SIR or SIR-derived models are a common modeling technique. However, the application of these models needs to solve complicated differential equations, enabling use of these models only by professional researchers. In this study, a simple, SIR-like but individual-based model, the l-i AIR model, is presented. The parameters l and i represent the length of the latent period and the infectious period, respectively. The variable A stands for the number of the infected people in the active infectious period, I for the number of cumulative infected people, and R for the number of the people in recovery or death. The nth terms of the three variables are derived, which can be easily calculated in Microsoft Excel, making the program easy to be used in most offices. A transmission coefficient k and a transient incidence rate of the infected people are induced in the model to examine the effect of social distancing and the testing capacity of coronavirus on the epidemic curves. The simulated daily new cases from this l-i AIR model can fit very well with the reported daily new cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China and in New York City, USA, providing important information about latent period, infectious period and lockdown efficiency, and calculating the number of actual infected people who are positive in antibodies.","Liu, Xiaoping",,3,1

METHODS: A Critical Care Task Force was established between Kansas City area intensive care units to allow for preparedness for potential surges by sharing of bed capacity both in the ICU and hospital, and ventilator capacity as well as weekly web-based meetings to share resource concerns and best practice. This Task Force also collected patient information to understand the dynamics of community impact and resource needs better. This effort allowed for compilation and dissemination of information regarding data that describe characteristics of patients with COVID-19 compared to a random sample of medical ICU patients with conditions other than COVID-19. Demographic and therapeutic factors affecting patients admitted to medical intensive care units in the Kansas City metro area are reported from May 5, 2020 until June 2, 2020 using a retrospective case-control study examining gender, race, and therapeutic options including modes of ventilation, vasopressor requirements, renal-replacement therapy, and disposition. RESULTS: During data collection, patients being treated for COVID-19 in intensive care units in the Kansas City metropolitan area were more likely to be older, less likely to be white, and less likely to be immunosuppressed as compared to those being treated for non-COVID illnesses. They were more likely to require non-invasive ventilation and undergo prone positioning but were equally likely to require invasive ventilation and other organ supportive therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalized patients being treated for COVID-19 in the Kansas City metropolitan area have similar demographics to those being reported in the U.S. including age and race. Additionally, establishing a Critical Care Task Force in response to the pandemic allowed for preparation for a potential surge, establishing capacity, and disseminating timely information to policy makers and critical care workers on the front line.","Burton, Michael C.; Satterwhite, Lewis; Shi, Xiaosong; Allen, Angelica; Castro, Mario",Kans J Med,3,30

In response to the pandemic health care services have increased the use of telehealth medicine. The propose of this study is to examine factors associated with access to telemedicine before and after COVID-19 based on sociodemographic factors and type of chronic disease. Method: We have used data from the Research and Development Survey (RANDS) at two different time points Data collection for the first wave occurred between June 9, 2020 and July 6, 2020 (n= 6786), second wave was between August 3, 2020 and August 20, 2020 (n=5972). Three questions have been asked from the participant: 1) did the provider offer telemedicine before the pandemic? 2) does the provider offer telemedicine during the pandemic? And 3) have the participants schedule telemedicine appointments? Result: In both waves, 62 % of the participants reported providers did not have telemedicine services prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, we found a 22% increase in offering telemedicine in six first month of the COVID-19 pandemic. The finding shows almost no change in providing telemedicine between June and August. The data indicates just a 0.5% and 0.1% increase in accessing telemedicine, and scheduling in August than June, respectively. Patients older than 65 had higher access to telemedicine and had higher scheduling frequencies than other age groups, while they had the lowest access prior to the COVID-19. Blacks had the highest access to telemedicine services than other races (40%). Additionally, females, higher education, and living in metropolitan areas were associated with higher access and scheduling during the pandemic. There was a variation of access and scheduling in different chronic diseases, however, providers offered more remote services for those who diagnosed by diabetes. Conclusion: The aim of telemedicine is to reduce disparities in healthcare access. The findings of this study show telemedicine has reduced racial disparities and provided greater accessibility for older groups. However, spatial and educational disparities are still noticeable.

Aim: We aimed to investigate the internet search behavior related to COVID-19 and the extent of infodemic monikers circulating in Google and Instagram during the pandemic period in the world. Methods: Using Google Trends and Instagram hashtags (#), we explored the internet search activities and behaviors related to COVID-19 pandemic all over the world from February 20, 2020, to May 06, 2020. Briefly, we investigated the names used to identify the virus, health and risk perception, life during the lockdown, and also information related to the adoption of infodemic monikers related to COVID-19. We computed the average peak volume (APC) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) during the study period. Results: The top five COVID-19 related terms used in Google searches were ""coronavirus"", ""corona"", ""COVID"", ""virus"", ""corona virus"", and ""COVID-19"". Countries with a higher number of COVID-19 cases have greater Google searches queries related to COVID-19. ""coronavirus ozone"", ""coronavirus laboratory"", ""coronavirus 5G"", ""coronavirus conspiracy"" and ""coronavirus bill gates"" are widely circulated infodemic monikers on the internet.

The complex interplay of risk factors and determinants that result in chronic disease is calling into question traditional surveillance systems in terms of what is collected to inform policy decisions. At the same time, the complexity presents an opportunity to broaden the evidence base on which arguments can be based for chronic disease intervention to increase their potential to influence policy makers. This article describes some initiatives in Canada to enhance the capacity and utility of surveillance systems and their associated data to inform policy making in the field of chronic disease.","Stachenko, S.",Public Health,3,16

To predict the impact of non-synonymous mutations and polyproline regions identified in ORF3a on the formation of B-cell epitopes and their role in evading the immune response, nucleotide and protein sequences of 537 available SARS-CoV-2 genomes were analyzed for the presence of non-synonymous mutations and polyproline regions. Mutations were correlated with changes in epitope formation. A total of 19 different non-synonymous amino acids substitutions were detected in ORF3a among 537 SARS-CoV-2 strains. G251V was the most common and identified in 9.9% (n=53) of the strains and was predicted to lead to the loss of a B-cell like epitope in ORF3a. Polyproline regions were detected in two strains (EPI_ISL_410486, France and EPI_ISL_407079, Finland) and affected epitopes formation. The accumulation of non-synonymous mutations and detected polyproline regions in ORF3a of SARS-CoV-2 could be driving the evasion of the host immune response thus favoring viral spread. Rapid mutations accumulating in ORF3a should be closely monitored throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Importance At the surge of the COVID-19 pandemic and after three months of the identification of SARS-CoV-2 as the disease-causing pathogen, nucleic acid changes due to host-pathogen interactions are insightful into the evolution of this virus. In this paper, we have identified a set of non-synonymous mutations in ORF3a and predicted their impact on B-cell like epitope formation. The accumulation of non-synonymous mutations in ORF3a could be driving protein changes that mediate immune evasion and favoring viral spread.","Issa, Elio; Merhi, Georgi; Panossian, Balig; Salloum, Tamara; Tokajian, Sima",bioRxiv,3,16

Recognising that there are unique aspects of veterinary practice in certain geographical regions of the world, the Vaccination Guidelines Group undertook a regional project in Latin America between 2016 and 2019, culminating in the present document. The Vaccination Guidelines Group gathered scientific and demographic data during visits to Argentina, Brazil and Mexico, by discussion with national key opinion leaders, visiting veterinary practices and review of the scientific literature. A questionnaire survey was completed by 1390 veterinarians in five Latin American countries and the Vaccination Guidelines Group delivered continuing education at seven events attended by over 3500 veterinarians. The Vaccination Guidelines Group recognised numerous challenges in Latin America, for example: (1) lack of national oversight of the veterinary profession, (2) extraordinary growth in private veterinary schools of undetermined quality, (3) socioeconomic constraints on client engagement with preventive health care, (4) high regional prevalence of some key infectious diseases (e.g. feline leukaemia virus infection, canine visceral leishmaniosis), (5) almost complete lack of minimal antigen vaccine products as available in other markets, (6) relative lack of vaccine products with extended duration of immunity as available in other markets, (7) availability of vaccine products withdrawn from other markets (e.g. Giardia vaccine) or unique to Latin America (e.g. some Leishmania vaccines), (8) accessibility of vaccines directly by pet owners or breeders such that vaccination is not delivered under veterinary supervision, (9) limited availability of continuing education in veterinary vaccinology and lack of compulsion for continuing professional development and (10) limited peer‐reviewed published scientific data on small companion animal infectious diseases (with the exception of leishmaniosis) and lack of support for such academic research. In this document, the Vaccination Guidelines Group summarises the findings of this project and assesses in evidence‐based fashion the scientific literature pertaining to companion animal vaccine‐preventable diseases in Latin America. The Vaccination Guidelines Group makes some recommendations on undergraduate and postgraduate education and academic research. Recognising that current product availability in Latin America does not permit veterinarians in these countries to vaccinate according to the global World Small Animal Veterinary Association guidelines, the Vaccination Guidelines Group makes a series of “pragmatic” recommendations as to what might be currently achievable, and a series of “aspirational” recommendations as to what might be desirable for the future. The concept of “vaccine husbandry” is addressed via some simple guidelines for the management of vaccine products in the practice. Finally, the Vaccination Guidelines Group emphasises the global trend towards delivery of vaccination as one part of an “annual health check” or “health care plan” that reviews holistically the preventive health care needs of the individual pet animal. Latin American practitioners should transition towards these important new practices that are now well embedded in more developed veterinary markets. The document also includes 70 frequently asked questions and their answers; these were posed to the Vaccination Guidelines Group during our continuing education events and small group discussions and should address many of the issues surrounding delivery of vaccination in the Latin American countries.

This disease is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The only available tools to avoid contamination and transmission of this virus are physical distancing, the use of N95 and surgical masks, and hand hygiene. Vaccines are another essential tool to reduce the impact of the pandemic, though these present challenges in terms of production and logistics, particularly in underdeveloped and developing countries. One of the critical early research findings is the interaction of the spike virus protein with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) human receptor. Developing strategies to block this interaction has therefore been identified as a way to treat this infection. Neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) have emerged as a therapeutic approach since the pandemic started. Infected patients may be asymptomatic or present with mild symptoms, and others may evolve to moderate or severe disease, leading to death. An immunological phenomenon known as cytokine storm has been observed in patients with severe disease characterized by a proinflammatory cytokine cascade response that leads to lung injury. Thus, some treatment strategies focus on anti-cytokine storm nAbs.

There are a very few prognostic models on CoVID-19 using machine learning. Objectives: To predict mortality among confirmed CoVID-19 patients in South Korea using machine learning and deploy the best performing algorithm as an open-source online prediction tool for decision-making. Materials and methods: Mortality for confirmed CoVID-19 patients (n=3,022) between January 20, 2020 and April 07, 2020 was predicted using five machine learning algorithms (logistic regression, support vector machine, K nearest neighbor, random forest and gradient boosting). Performance of the algorithms was compared, and the best performing algorithm was deployed as an online prediction tool. Results: The gradient boosting algorithm was the best performer in terms of discrimination (area under ROC curve=0.966), calibration (Matthews Correlation Coefficient=0.656; Brier Score=0.013) and predictive ability (accuracy=0.987). The best performer algorithm (gradient boosting) was deployed as the online CoVID-19 Community Mortality Risk Prediction tool named CoCoMoRP (https://ashis-das.shinyapps.io/CoCoMoRP/). Conclusions: We describe the framework for the rapid development and deployment of an open-source machine learning tool to predict mortality risk among CoVID-19 confirmed patients using publicly available surveillance data.

We have developed an internet-based, OSCE-like, conversational VP system designed both for training and assessment of medical students. The system, that encompasses complete patient management from H&P to diagnostic procedures and treatment, has now been used regularly during the clerkship of internal medicine. The present article describes the system and compares assessments undertaken with the VP-system over the last five years, to traditional bed-side oral exams. All students practiced on their own exercise VP cases, while preparing for the final exam. A total of 586 students were evaluated simultaneously with both assessment modalities. The αCronbach of the VP exam averaged 0.86. No correlation was found between the grades obtained in the two exams, indicating that the VP exam evaluated different parameters than those assessed by the examiners in the oral examinations.

In this commentary, we demystify diseases related to 'lifestyle' and put this in the context of the age-old public health way of classifying diseases as communicable and non-communicable (NCDs). Evidence indicates that unhealthy lifestyles, in addition to causing NCDs, can also result in reduced immunity and/or cause injury to organs predisposing individuals to diseases, and their severity, traditionally defined as 'communicable' such as COVID-19. COVID-19 has demonstrated the nexus between communicable and NCDs as never before in no uncertain terms. Two important messages that have emerged from the pandemic are: (1) there is close proximity of communicable diseases to NCDs; and (2) individual personal hygiene-related lifestyles can influence the occurrence, severity and prevention of communicable diseases such as COVID-19.","Doraiswamy, Sathyanarayanan; Cheema, Sohaila; Mamtani, Ravinder",Glob Health Promot,3,18

According to reports, cytokine storm is strongly responsible for death in such patients. Some of the consequences of severe inflammation and cytokine storms include acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute lung injury, and multiple organ dysfunction syndromes. Phylogenetic findings show more similarity of the SARS-CoV-2 virus with bat coronaviruses, and less with SARS-CoV. Quercetin is a carbohydrate-free flavonoid that is the most abundant flavonoid in vegetables and fruits and has been the most studied to determine the biological effects of flavonoids. Inflammasomes are cytosolic multi-protein complexes assembling in response to cytosolic PAMP and DAMPs, whose function is to generate active forms of cytokines IL-1β and IL-18. Activation or inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome is affected by regulators such as TXNIP, SIRT1 and NRF2. Quercetin suppresses the NLRP3 inflammasome by affecting these regulators.

Three viral proteins, the spike protein (S) for attachment of virus to host cells, 3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (M(pro)) for digestion of viral polyproteins to functional proteins, and RNA-dependent-RNA-polymerase (RdRp) for RNA synthesis are the most critical proteins for virus infection and replication, rendering them the most important drug targets for both antibody and chemical drugs. Due to its low-fidelity polymerase, the virus is subject to frequent mutations. To date, the sequence data from tens of thousands of virus isolates have revealed hundreds of mutations. Although most mutations have a minimum consequence, a small number of non-synonymous mutations may alter the virulence and antigenicity of the mutants. To evaluate the effects of viral mutations on drug safety and efficacy, we reviewed the biochemical features of the three main proteins and their potentials as drug targets, and analyzed the mutation profiles and their impacts on RNA therapeutics. We believe that monitoring and predicting mutation-introduced protein conformational changes in the three key viral proteins and evaluating their binding affinities and enzymatic activities with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulated drugs by using computational modeling and machine learning processes can provide valuable information for the consideration of drug efficacy and drug safety for drug developers and drug reviewers.

One of the core survival factors is patient age. However, chronological age is often severely biased due to dormant conditions and existing comorbidities. In this retrospective cohort study, we analyzed the data from 5315 COVID-19 patients (1689 lethal cases) admitted to 11 public hospitals in New York City from 1 March 2020 to 1 December. We calculated patients’ pace of aging with BloodAge—a deep learning aging clock trained on clinical blood tests. We further constructed survival models to explore the prognostic value of biological age compared to that of chronological age. A COVID-19 score was developed to support a practical patient stratification in a clinical setting. Lethal COVID-19 cases had higher predicted age, compared to non-lethal cases ([Formula: see text] = 0.8–1.6 years). Increased pace of aging was a significant risk factor of COVID-related mortality (hazard ratio = 1.026 per year, 95% CI = 1.001–1.052). According to our logistic regression model, the pace of aging had a greater impact (adjusted odds ratio = 1.09 ± 0.00, per year) than chronological age (1.04 ± 0.00, per year) on the lethal infection outcome. Our results show that a biological age measure, derived from routine clinical blood tests, adds predictive power to COVID-19 survival models.","Galkin, Fedor; Parish, Austin; Bischof, Evelyne; Zhang, John; Mamoshina, Polina; Zhavoronkov, Alex",Life (Basel),3,29

We designed the present longitudinal study to evaluate the psychological impact of quarantine in Italian community-dwelling adult participants. Methods: A sample of 304 Italian community-dwelling adult participants (75.7% female; mean age = 35.28 years) was administered self-reported measures of depression, anxiety and acute stress symptoms at the beginning and at the end of the lockdown. Potential predictors of clinically relevant symptoms at the end of the lockdown were assessed. Specifically, data on gender, civil status, education level, occupation, and area of residence, as well as maladaptive personality domains were collected. Results: More than 43% of participants suffered from the early impact of the lockdown; at the end of the lockdown roughly 32% of participants still reported any clinically relevant depression anxiety, and/or acute stress disorder condition. Clinically relevant acute stress reaction at the beginning of lockdown was a particularly important risk factor for experiencing clinically relevant acute stress, depression, and anxiety at the end of the lockdown. Maladaptive personality domains represent non-trivial predictors of participants’ self-reports of clinically relevant depression, anxiety, and acute stress conditions at the end of the lockdown. Limitations: Excess of female participants and the impossibility of evaluating if participants suffered from any internalizing disorder before the COVID-19 quarantine represent major limitations of our study.

A total of 344 veterinarians completed the questionnaire of which 63.7% were women, 63.2% worked in small/companion animal practice, and 79.9% worked in private veterinary practice. Of the respondents, 44.9% reported contracting a zoonosis during their careers with 19.7% reporting a suspected case and 25.2% reporting a confirmed incidence. Around 40–60% of veterinarians perceived exposure to zoonosis likely or very likely in a variety of situations. With reference to current national industry guidelines, the reported use of PPE was less than “adequate” for most scenarios except for performing postmortems, surgery or dental procedures. No PPE was used by 60–70% of veterinarians for treating respiratory and neurological cases and by 40–50% when treating gastrointestinal and dermatological cases. Workplace conditions need improvement as 34.8% of workplaces did not have isolation units for infected animals, 21.1% did not have separate eating areas for staff, and 57.1% did not have complete PPE kits for use. Veterinarians were more likely to use PPE if they had undertaken postgraduate education, perceived that zoonosis exposure from animals and procedures was likely, consciously considered PPE use for every case they dealt with and believed that liability issues and risks encouraged use of PPE. In contrast, those working in private practices, those who tended to ‘just hope for the best’ when trying to avoid zoonotic diseases, and those who were not aware of industry guidelines were less likely to use PPE. The results suggest that veterinarians’ perceptions and workplace policies and culture substantially influence their use of PPE. Efforts should be made to encourage veterinarians and their workplaces to use infection control practices to protect themselves and their staff from zoonotic diseases.","Dowd, Karen; Taylor, Melanie; Toribio, Jenny-Ann L.M.L.; Hooker, Claire; Dhand, Navneet K.",Prev Vet Med,3,21

As a result, the development of vaccines to protect individuals from symptomatic COVID-19 infections has represented the only feasible health tool to combat the spread of the disease. However, at the same time the development and regulatory assessment of different vaccines has challenged pharmaceutical industries and regulatory agencies as this process has occurred in the shorter time ever though. So far, two mRNA and two adenovirus-vectored vaccines have received a conditional marketing authorisation in the EU and other countries. This review summarized and discusses the assessment reports of the European Medicine Agency (EMA) concerning the safety of the 3 vaccines currently used in the EU (Pfizer, Moderna and Astra-Zeneca). A particular focus has been paid to safety information from pre-clinical (animal) and clinical (phase 3 trials) studies. Overall, the most frequent adverse effects reported after the administration of these vaccines consisted of local reactions at the injection site (sore arm and erythema) followed by non-specific systemic effects (myalgia, chills, fatigue, headache, and fever), which occurred soon after vaccination and resolved shortly. Rare cases of vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia have been reported for Vaxzevria. Data on long-term studies, interaction with other vaccines, use in pregnancy/breast-feeding, use in immunocompromised subjects, and in subjects with comorbidities, autoimmune or inflammatory disorders are still missing for these vaccines. Therefore, careful follow-up and surveillance studies for continued vaccine safety monitoring will be needed to ascertain the potential risks of such adverse events or diseases. In conclusion, the benefits and risks of current COVID-19 vaccines must be weighed against the real possibility of contract the disease and develop complications and long-term sequels; all this on the basis of the available scientific evidence and in the absence of unmotivated biases.","Hernández, Antonio F.; Calina, Daniela; Poulas, Konstantinos; Docea, Anca Oana; Tsatsakis, Aristidis M.",Toxicol Rep,3,26

In response, strict screening, quarantine protocols, and contact tracing have been conducted in South Korea. The purpose of this study was to examine effects of social distancing on the Public Bicycle Sharing System (PBSS) during the COVID-19 outbreak. We used the PBSS public dataset of Seoul, South Korea. Difference-in-differences (DID) analysis was used. In the DID approach, the 2 groups are distinguished based on designated year. Cases of PBSS use were observed in 2 time periods: pre- and post-strict social distancing in Seoul, Korea. Average PBSS usage per day doubled during 2019-2020 (30 697 vs 77 996, P < .001). Commuters and weekend users increased during the social distancing period in 2020 compared with the same period in 2019. DID analysis showed statistically significant positive effects of high levels of social distancing on PBSS usage, commuters, weekend users, and new subscribers. In conclusion, social distancing during the COVID-19 outbreak increased outdoor physical activity. Meaningful outdoor physical activity during the COVID-19 pandemic can be safe from infection and psychologically stabilized as long as keeping meticulous physical distancing, such as hand hygiene, wearing facial masks, and surface cleaning of public resources.","Park, Sunhee; Kim, Beomsoo; Lee, Jaeil",Asia Pac J Public Health,3,4

The extensive cellular and molecular complexity of our immune system enables us to efficiently eliminate invading pathogens or at least develop a condition in which propagation of the microorganism is reduced to a minimum. Yet, the evolutionary pressure on pathogens to circumvent our immune defense mechanisms is immense, which continuously leads to the development of novel pathogenic strains that challenge the health of mankind. Understanding this battle between pathogen and the immune system has been a fruitful area of immunological research over the last century and will continue to do so for many years. In this review, which has been written on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the Dutch Society for Immunology, we provide an overview of the major contributions that Dutch immunologists and infection biologists have made in the last decades on the inflammatory response to viral, bacterial, fungal or parasitic infections. We focus on those studies that have addressed both the host and the pathogen, as these are most interesting from an immunological point of view.

Upon propagation in VeroE6 cells, SARS-CoV-2 may mutate or delete the multibasic cleavage site (MBCS) in the spike protein. Previously, we showed that the MBCS facilitates serine protease-mediated entry into human airway cells (Mykytyn et al., 2021). Here, we report that propagating SARS-CoV-2 on the human airway cell line Calu-3 – that expresses serine proteases – prevents cell culture adaptations in the MBCS and directly adjacent to the MBCS (S686G). Similar results were obtained using a human airway organoid-based culture system for SARS-CoV-2 propagation. Thus, in-depth knowledge on the biology of a virus can be used to establish methods to prevent cell culture adaptation.","Lamers, Mart M; Mykytyn, Anna Z; Breugem, Tim I; Wang, Yiquan; Wu, Douglas C; Riesebosch, Samra; van den Doel, Petra B; Schipper, Debby; Bestebroer, Theo; Wu, Nicholas C; Haagmans, Bart L",eLife (Cambridge),3,26

Consequently, a search is on for a treatment that can bring the pandemic to an end. However, treatments (vaccine, antiviral, plasma) that are directed at specific viral proteins (RNA polymerase, spike proteins) may not work well against all strains of the virus. Therefore, it is hypothesized that a therapy based on multiple treatments is needed for COVID-19 patients and to bring the pandemic to an end. Here, it is proposed that a combination of cool air therapy (CAT) and purified air technology (PAT) in an oxygen species cool air respirator (OSCAR) could be used to reduce viral (SARS-CoV-2) load and severity of illness in COVID-19 patients through the individual dose-response relationship. In addition, the proposed therapy (CAT+PAT in OSCAR), which works by a more general physical and chemical mechanism, should work well with other treatments (vaccine, antiviral, plasma) that target specific viral proteins (RNA polymerase, spike proteins) to provide a safe and effective multiple therapy approach for ending the COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2.","Oscar, Thomas P.",Med Hypotheses,3,32

METHODS: Post-hoc analysis from the nationwide observational CORONADO study: patients with T2D and history of MBS were matched with patients without MBS for age, sex and body mass index (BMI) either at the time of MBS or on admission for COVID-19. The composite primary outcome (CPO) combined invasive mechanical ventilation and/or death within 7 and 28 days following admission. RESULTS: Out of 2 398 CORONADO participants, 20 had history of MBS. When matching for BMI at the time of MBS and after adjustment on diabetes duration, the CPO occurred less frequently within 7 days (3 vs 17 events, OR: 0.15 [0.01-0.94], P=0.03) and 28 days (3 vs 19 events, OR: 0.11 (0.01-0.71), P=0.02) in patients with MBS (n=16) vs controls (n=44). There was no difference in CPO rate between patients with MBS and controls when matching for BMI on admission.

Clinical characteristics of the latter are heterogeneous and not yet fully elucidated, while the pathogenesis appears related to neuroinflammation in a subset of patients. Case: A middle-aged man presented with acute language disturbance at the emergency department. Examination revealed expressive aphasia, mild ideomotor slowing, and severe hypocapnic hypoxemia. Multimodal CT assessment and electroencephalogram (EEG) did not reveal any abnormalities. COVID-19 was diagnosed based on chest CT findings and positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) on nasopharyngeal swab. The following day, neurological symptoms progressed to agitated delirium and respiratory status worsened, requiring admission to the ICU and mechanical ventilation. Brain MRI and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies were unremarkable. RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 on CSF was negative. He received supportive treatment and intravenous low-dose steroids. His neurological and respiratory status resolved completely within 2 weeks. Conclusions: We report a patient with reversible COVID-19-related encephalopathy presenting as acute aphasia, mimicking stroke or status epilepticus, eventually evolving into delirium. Although large-vessel stroke is frequently encountered in COVID-19, our case suggests that focal neurological deficits may occur as the earliest feature of encephalopathy. Neurological status reversibility and the absence of abnormalities on brain MRI are consistent with a functional rather than a structural neuronal network impairment.","Pensato, Umberto; Muccioli, Lorenzo; Pasini, Elena; Tappatà, Maria; Ferri, Lorenzo; Volpi, Lilia; Licchetta, Laura; Battaglia, Stella; Rossini, Giada; Bon, Isabella; Re, Maria Carla; Cirillo, Luigi; Simonetti, Luigi; Gramegna, Laura Ludovica; Michelucci, Roberto; Cortelli, Pietro; Zini, Andrea; Bisulli, Francesca",Front Neurol,3,11

The main research goal was the identification of groups or segments of players by their engagement levels (high, neutral, low) and to assess preferences in product category with the use of CHAID (Chi-Square Automatic Interaction Detection) segmentation models, based on expenditure and sociodemographic variables. Findings showed that (1) age was found to be the most influential differentiating variable in player segmentation and had a positive correlation with expenditures and wagers, (2) gender was the second most influential variable (males represented 78.7% of players), (3) education the third most influential variable and had a negative correlation with expenditure, and (4) region was the least relevant variable. The models generated several players segments that engaged in different games. Older males (54–64 years; ≥ 65 years) were the most engaged overall. Younger males (18–34 years) were the least engaged but showed preferences for lotto as did females (35–49 years). Lower educated males and older males (49 years+) with a high school education were the most engaged in instant lottery games. These findings show that Portuguese lottery players can be grouped into several segments with distinct demographic characteristics and corresponding engagement levels.

However, in aging, chronic infections, acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, cancer, chronic stress, depression and major injury/trauma, T cells are often scarce, exhausted, senescent, impaired/biased and dysfunctional. People with impaired/dysfunctional T cells are at high risk of infections, cancer, other diseases, and eventually mortality, and become multi-level burden on other people, organizations and societies. It is suggested that “Nerve-Driven Immunity” and “Personalized Adoptive Neuro-Immunotherapy” may overcome this problem. Natural Neurotransmitters and Neuropeptides: Glutamate, Dopamine, GnRH-II, CGRP, Neuropeptide Y, Somatostatin and others, bind their well-characterized receptors expressed on the cell surface of naïve/resting T cells and induce multiple direct, beneficial, and therapeutically relevant effects. These Neurotransmitters and Neuropeptides can induce/increase: gene expression, cytokine secretion, integrin-mediated adhesion, chemotactic migration, extravasation, proliferation, and killing of cancer. Moreover, we recently found that some of these Neurotransmitters and Neuropeptides also induce rapid and profound decrease of PD-1 in human T cells. By inducing these beneficial effects in naïve/resting T cells at different times after binding their receptors (i.e. NOT by single effect/mechanism/pathway), these Neurotransmitters and Neuropeptides by themselves can activate, rejuvenate, and improve T cells. “Personalized Adaptive Neuro-Immunotherapy” is a novel method for rejuvenating and improving T cells safely and potently by Neurotransmitters and Neuropeptides, consisting of personalized diagnostic and therapeutic protocols. The patient’s scarce and/or dysfunctional T cells are activated ex vivo once by pre-selected Neurotransmitters and/or Neuropeptides, tested, and re-inoculated to the patient’s body. Neuro-Immunotherapy can be actionable and repeated whenever needed, and allows other treatments. This adoptive Neuro-Immunotherapy calls for testing its safety and efficacy in clinical trials.","Levite, Mia",Front Immunol,3,1

In recent years, the list of FDA-approved ON therapies has rapidly expanded. ONs are small (15–30 bp) nucleotide-based therapeutics which are capable of targeting DNA and RNA as well as other biomolecules. ONs can be subdivided into several classes based on their chemical modifications and on the mechanisms of their target interactions. Historically, the largest hindrance to the widespread usage of ON therapeutics has been their inability to effectively internalize into cells and escape from endosomes to reach their molecular targets in the cytosol or nucleus. While cell uptake has been improved, “endosomal escape” remains a significant problem. There are a range of approaches to overcome this, and in this review, we focus on three: altering the chemical structure of the ONs, formulating synthetic, lipid-based nanoparticles to encapsulate the ONs, or biologically loading the ONs into extracellular vesicles. This review provides a background to the design and mode of action of existing FDA-approved ONs. It presents the most common ON classifications and chemical modifications from a fundamental scientific perspective and provides a roadmap of the cellular uptake pathways by which ONs are trafficked.

METHODS: We investigated the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in seropositive and seronegative health care workers attending testing of asymptomatic and symptomatic staff at Oxford University Hospitals in the United Kingdom. Baseline antibody status was determined by anti-spike (primary analysis) and anti-nucleocapsid IgG assays, and staff members were followed for up to 31 weeks. We estimated the relative incidence of PCR-positive test results and new symptomatic infection according to antibody status, adjusting for age, participant-reported gender, and changes in incidence over time. RESULTS: A total of 12,541 health care workers participated and had anti-spike IgG measured; 11,364 were followed up after negative antibody results and 1265 after positive results, including 88 in whom seroconversion occurred during follow-up. A total of 223 anti-spike–seronegative health care workers had a positive PCR test (1.09 per 10,000 days at risk), 100 during screening while they were asymptomatic and 123 while symptomatic, whereas 2 anti-spike–seropositive health care workers had a positive PCR test (0.13 per 10,000 days at risk), and both workers were asymptomatic when tested (adjusted incidence rate ratio, 0.11; 95% confidence interval, 0.03 to 0.44; P=0.002). There were no symptomatic infections in workers with anti-spike antibodies. Rate ratios were similar when the anti-nucleocapsid IgG assay was used alone or in combination with the anti-spike IgG assay to determine baseline status.

Results: The results showed that the mean score of hypochondriasis in different groups of variables, including age, work experience, use of personal protective equipment, corona experience, and attention to preventive measures was significantly different (p<0.05). Based on the results, the mean score of job stress significantly differed in different groups of variables of personal protective equipment use, corona experience, and awareness on corona (p<0.05). Moreover, based on the regression relationships, hypochondriasis could be predicted by variables of personal protective equipment, corona experience, awareness on corona, and attention to preventive measures; and job stress could be predicted by variables of awareness on corona and attention to preventive measures.

In light of implementing WHO consolidated guidelines on self-care interventions to strengthen sexual and reproductive health (SRH) in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR), especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, pharmacists from four different EMR countries discussed the current SRH situation, inequality gaps, barriers to SRH service access and the pharmacist’s crucial role as a first-line responder to patients before, during and after COVID-19. CASE PRESENTATION: Self-care interventions for SRH allow health care providers to serve a greater number of patients, improve progress toward universal health coverage, and reach people in humanitarian crises. In fact, these interventions can be significantly enhanced by utilizing community pharmacists as first-line health care providers. This review highlights the important role of community pharmacists in promoting self-care interventions and empowering individuals, families and communities. As a result, well-informed individuals will be authoritative in their health decisions. Exploring self-care interventions in the EMR was done through reviewing selected SRH services delivery through community pharmacists before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon and Somalia. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, community pharmacists were found to be excluded from both governmental and nongovernmental SRH programmes. During the pandemic, community pharmacists managed to support patients with self-care interventions, whether voluntarily or through their pharmacy associations. This highlights the need for the health care decision-makers to involve and support community pharmacists in influencing policies and promoting self-care interventions. CONCLUSION: Self-care interventions can increase individuals’ choice and autonomy over SRH. Supporting community pharmacists will definitely strengthen SRH in the EMR and may help make the health system more efficient and more targeted.","El Bizri, Luna; Jarrar, Laila Ghazi; Ali, Wael K.

Positive results from early studies attracted media attention and led to emergency use authorisation of remdesivir in COVID-19. A thorough understanding of the current evidence regarding the effects of remdesivir as a treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection based on randomised controlled trials (RCTs) is required. OBJECTIVES To assess the effects of remdesivir compared to placebo or standard care alone on clinical outcomes in hospitalised patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, and to maintain the currency of the evidence using a living systematic review approach. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register (which comprises the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and medRxiv) as well as Web of Science (Science Citation Index Expanded and Emerging Sources Citation Index) and WHO COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease to identify completed and ongoing studies without language restrictions. We conducted the searches on 16 April 2021. SELECTION CRITERIA We followed standard Cochrane methodology. We included RCTs evaluating remdesivir for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection in hospitalised adults compared to placebo or standard care alone irrespective of disease severity, gender, ethnicity, or setting. We excluded studies that evaluated remdesivir for the treatment of other coronavirus diseases. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS We followed standard Cochrane methodology. To assess risk of bias in included studies, we used the Cochrane RoB 2 tool for RCTs. We rated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach for outcomes that were reported according to our prioritised categories: all-cause mortality at up to day 28, duration to liberation from invasive mechanical ventilation, duration to liberation from supplemental oxygen, new need for mechanical ventilation (high-flow oxygen or non-invasive or invasive mechanical ventilation), new need for invasive mechanical ventilation, new need for non-invasive mechanical ventilation or high-flow oxygen, new need for oxygen by mask or nasal prongs, quality of life, adverse events (any grade), and serious adverse events. MAIN RESULTS We included five RCTs with 7452 participants diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection and a mean age of 59 years, of whom 3886 participants were randomised to receive remdesivir. Most participants required low-flow oxygen (n=4409) or mechanical ventilation (n=1025) at baseline. We identified two ongoing studies, one was suspended due to a lack of COVID-19 patients to recruit. Risk of bias was considered to be of some concerns or high risk for clinical status and safety outcomes because participants who had died did not contribute information to these outcomes. Without adjustment, this leads to an uncertain amount of missing values and the potential for bias due to missing data. Effects of remdesivir in hospitalised individuals Remdesivir probably makes little or no difference to all-cause mortality at up to day 28 (risk ratio (RR) 0.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81 to 1.06; risk difference (RD) 8 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 21 fewer to 7 more; 4 studies, 7142 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Considering the initial severity of condition, only one study showed a beneficial effect of remdesivir in patients who received low-flow oxygen at baseline (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.66, 435 participants), but conflicting results exists from another study, and we were unable to validly assess this observations due to limited availability of comparable data. Remdesivir may have little or no effect on the duration to liberation from invasive mechanical ventilation (2 studies, 1298 participants, data not pooled, low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether remdesivir increases or decreases the chance of clinical improvement in terms of duration to liberation from supplemental oxygen at up to day 28 (3 studies, 1691 participants, data not pooled, very low-certainty evidence). We are very uncertain whether remdesivir decreases or increases the risk of clinical worsening in terms of new need for mechanical ventilation at up to day 28 (high-flow oxygen or non-invasive ventilation or invasive mechanical ventilation) (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.24; RD 29 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 68 fewer to 32 more; 3 studies, 6696 participants; very low-certainty evidence); new need for non-invasive mechanical ventilation or high-flow oxygen (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.98; RD 72 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 118 fewer to 5 fewer; 1 study, 573 participants; very low-certainty evidence); and new need for oxygen by mask or nasal prongs (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.22; RD 84 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 204 fewer to 98 more; 1 study, 138 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The evidence suggests that remdesivir may decrease the risk of clinical worsening in terms of new need for invasive mechanical ventilation (67 fewer participants amongst 1000 participants; RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.77; 2 studies, 1159 participants; low-certainty evidence). None of the included studies reported quality of life. Remdesivir probably decreases the serious adverse events rate at up to 28 days (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.90; RD 63 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 94 fewer to 25 fewer; 3 studies, 1674 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). We are very uncertain whether remdesivir increases or decreases adverse events rate (any grade) (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.27; RD 29 more per 1000, 95% CI 82 fewer to 158 more; 3 studies, 1674 participants; very low-certainty evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Based on the currently available evidence, we are moderately certain that remdesivir probably has little or no effect on all-cause mortality at up to day 28 in hospitalised adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection. We are uncertain about the effects of remdesivir on clinical improvement and worsening. There were insufficient data available to validly examine the effect of remdesivir on mortality in subgroups depending on the extent of respiratory support at baseline. Future studies should provide additional data on efficacy and safety of remdesivir for defined core outcomes in COVID-19 research, especially for different population subgroups. This could allow us to draw more reliable conclusions on the potential benefits and harms of remdesivir in future updates of this review. Due to the living approach of this work, we will update the review periodically.","Ansems, Kelly; Grundeis, Felicitas; Dahms, Karolina; Mikolajewska, Agata; Thieme, Volker; Piechotta, Vanessa; Metzendorf, Maria-Inti; Stegemann, Miriam; Benstoem, Carina; Fichtner, Falk",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,3,30

Incidence data of typhoid and paratyphoid between 2004 and 2016 in China were analyzed descriptively to explore the epidemiological features such as age-specific and geographical distribution. Cumulative incidence of both fevers displayed significant decrease nationally, displaying a drop of 73.9% for typhoid and 86.6% for paratyphoid in 2016 compared to 2004. Cumulative incidence fell in all age subgroups and the 0–4 years-old children were the most susceptible ones in recent years. A cluster of three southwestern provinces (Yunnan, Guizhou, and Guangxi) were the top high-incidence regions. Grey model GM (1,1) and seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model were employed to extract the long-term trends of the diseases. Annual cumulative incidence for typhoid and paratyphoid were formulated by GM (1,1) as [Image: see text] and [Image: see text] respectively. SARIMA (0,1,7) × (1,0,1)(12) was selected among a collection of constructed models for high R(2) and low errors. The predictive models for both fevers forecasted cumulative incidence to continue the slightly downward trend and maintain the cyclical seasonality in near future years. Such data-driven insights are informative and actionable for the prevention and control of typhoid and paratyphoid fevers as serious infectious diseases.","Gao, Jiaqi; Li, Jiayuan; Wang, Mengqiao",PLoS One,3,16

Most studies focus on deliberate system-level transformations, usually guided by a set of influential actors. However, system-level transformations may also occur as the result of the cascading effects of multiple individual transformations in response or in anticipation to various crises. Little is known about how crises foster these individual transformations, and how these may relate to different types of system-level change. This article fills this gap by looking at how crisis fosters two different types of agencies—internal and external—and how these link to individual transformations in the case of Greece’s back-to-the-land movement whereby urbanites sought to reconnect with land-based livelihoods during the economic crisis (2008 onwards). The article draws on the qualitative analysis of 76 interviews of back-to-the-landers to further understand why people are going back-to-the-land (their motivations), how these relate to the concept of agency and individual transformation, and what implications might there be for system-level social-ecological transformations. This article makes three key points. First, crises create different opportunity contexts that may lead to rapid changes in what is valued in the broader social discourse. While social values and discourses are usually considered to be “deep levers” and slow to change, we found that they can rapidly shift in times of crises, challenging notions of the role of fast vs. slow variables in system transformations. Second, agency is needed to respond to crises but is also further catalyzed and enhanced through crisis; activating one’s internal agency leads to personal transformations as well as collective transformations (linked to external agency), which are mutually co-constitutive. And third, systemic-level transformation emerges through multiple pathways including through the aggregation of multiple individual transformations that may lead to emergent system-level changes.

Dysbiosis, caused by disruption of the gastrointestinal microbiota, is known to predispose rabbits to rabbit enteritis complex (REC), a major cause of morbidity and mortality. The objectives of this study were to describe the fecal microbiota of domestic rabbits from a variety of settings (commercial meat, companion, laboratory, and shelter) and to identify how factors such as age, season, and routine antimicrobial use affect the fecal microbiota composition. RESULTS: A total of 86 pooled commercial meat, 54 companion, 14 pooled laboratory, and 14 shelter rabbit fecal samples were evaluated using 16S rRNA gene sequencing of the V4 region. In all sample types, the predominant bacterial phylum was Firmicutes. Other commonly identified phyla (composing ≥ 1% of the total microbiota composition) were Verrucomicrobia, Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes. Significant differences in composition were noted between commercial, companion, laboratory, and shelter rabbit samples for proportions of Verrucomicrobia (P < 0.01), Proteobacteria (P < 0.01), and Lentisphaerae (P = 0.01) within the total microbiota. Within the commercial meat rabbit samples, significant differences between the microbiota composition of growers (n = 42) and does (n = 44) were limited to one unclassified Firmicutes (P = 0.03) and no differences were identified at the phylum level. Significant differences were present between fecal samples taken from rabbits during the summer (n = 44) compared to the winter (n = 42), with Firmicutes (P = 0.04), Verrucomicrobia (P = 0.03), Proteobacteria (P = 0.02), Deinococcus-Thermus (P = 0.04), Armatimonadates (P = 0.003), and Actinobacteria (P = 0.03) forming significantly different proportions of the microbiota. The only significant difference in composition between those farms that routinely reported antimicrobial use and those that did not was in one unclassified Bacteroidetes (P < 0.05) and no differences were identified at the phylum level. CONCLUSIONS: Rabbit husbandry and diet, in addition to season, significantly influence the fecal microbiota composition of domestic rabbits, while age of the rabbit post-weaning has minimal impact.

This phosphorylation is shown to occur not only in vitro (with pure LPH and pure catalytic subunit of PKA), but also in an organ culture of the small intestine. Cholera toxin, which is known to act in vivo on the membranes of the small intestine, with severe clinical consequences, and to elevate the intracellular cyclic AMP of enterocytes, is shown to enhance significantly the phosphorylation of LPH in intact cells grown as an organ culture. These findings establish the cytosolic orientation of the car☐yterminus tail of LPH in situ, and raise the possibility that the tail itself and its phosphorylation by PKA may have a physiological or physiopathological significance.","Keller, Patrick; Semenza, Giorgio; Shaltiel, Shmuel",FEBS Letters,3,1

Here, we synthesize literature on human, plant, and animal diseases to evaluate the relative contributions of host, pathogen, and environmental factors in driving transmission heterogeneity across hosts and space. We show that host and spatial heterogeneity are closely linked and that quantitatively assessing the contribution of infectious individuals, species, or environmental patches to overall transmission can aid management strategies.

Key findings and conclusions: The regions affected by COVID-19 showed great variations in the prices of products sold in the studied Ceasas. Statistical analysis showed that food prices were dependent on the regions and the period in which they were traded. In general, the month of March proved to have the greatest impact on the consumer's pocket.

The UK Government has not exempted vaccinated individuals from behavioural measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19, such as practicing social distancing. However, vaccinated individuals may have reduced compliance with these measures, given lower perceived risks. Methods: We used fives waves of monthly panel data from the UK COVID-19 Social Study to assess compliance following vaccination. Compliance was measured with two items on compliance with guidelines in general and compliance with social distancing. We used matching to create comparable groups of individuals by vaccination status and month of vaccination (January vaccination and February vaccination) and used fixed effects models to estimate changes in compliance between October 2020 - February 2021, a period which overlapped with the second wave of COVID-19 in the UK. Results: Vaccinated individuals were broadly keyworkers or older aged individuals. Compliance increased between October 2020 - February 2021, regardless of vaccination status or month of vaccination. There was some evidence that individuals vaccinated in January complied less with social distancing in January and February than matched non-vaccinated individuals, though associations were small and there were no similar clear differences in any month comparing January vaccinated with February vaccinated individuals and February vaccinated with non-vaccinated individuals. Conclusion: There was limited evidence that vaccinated individuals reduced compliance after receiving vaccination. Vaccinated individuals in the sample were older on average and the follow-up period post-vaccination was relatively short (1-2 months). Results require replication in other populations.","Wright, L.; Steptoe, A.; Mak, H. W.; Fancourt, D.",,3,28

The Westchester Behavioral Health Center of New York Presbyterian Hospital (WBHC-NYP) adopted a comprehensive infection control protocol consistent with these recommendations in April, 2020. We reviewed the records of 1,139 patients treated on the inpatient service at WBHC-NYP between March 14th and June 10(th), 2020, dates corresponding to the first COVID-19 surge in the New York City metropolitan region. The incidence of detected nosocomial or possible nosocomial infections before and during the implementation of the protocol was 0.096 (16/167), or 0.96 infections per 10 at-risk patients. The incidence of nosocomial or possible nosocomial infections after complete implementation was 0.0110 (2/182), or 1.1 infections per 100 at-risk patients. The difference in incidence between the two time points was statistically significant (p<.0003) and represents a 9-fold decrease. Our findings support the institutional use of a combined testing and space allocation protocol to mitigate risk of outbreaks in confined settings.","Brody, Benjamin D.; Shi, Zhenzhen; Shaffer, Charles; Eden, Daniel; Wyka, Katarzyna; Parish, Sharon J.; Alexopoulos, George S.; Nazario, Helen; Russ, Mark J.; Kanellopoulos, Dora",Psychiatry Res,3,23

Individuals recovered from COVID-19 at three public hospitals in Madrid (Spain) were scheduled for a telephonic interview. They were systematically asked about the presence of respiratory symptoms, e.g., fatigue, dyspnea, chest pain, and cough after hospital discharge. Clinical and hospitalization data were collected from hospital records. Overall, 1,950 patients (47% women, mean age:61, SD:16 years) were assessed at 11.2 months (SD 0.5) after hospital discharge. Just 367 (18.8%) were completely free of any respiratory post-COVID -19 symptom. The prevalence of long-term cough, chest pain, dyspnea, and fatigue was 2.5%, 6.5%, 23.3%, and 61.2%, respectively. Clinical and hospitalization factors were not associated with long-term post-COVID-19 cough. In conclusion, the prevalence of post-COVID-19 cough one year after SARS-CoV-2 infection was 2.5% in subjects who had survived hospitalization for COVID-19.

Interest in electroencephalographic (EEG) coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) findings has been growing, especially in the search for a specific-features EEG of encephalopathy. Methods. We made a retrospective analysis of 29 EEGs recorded in 15 patients with COVID-19 and neurological symptoms. We classified the EEGs as ""Acute EEG"" and ""follow-up EEG."" We did a statistical analysis between voltage and respiratory status of the patient, stay or not in the intensive care unit (ICU), days of stay in the ICU, sedative drugs, pharmacological treatment, type of symptoms predominating, and outcome. Results. We found EEG abnormalities in all patients studied. We observed the amplitude of background <20 µV at 93% of ""acute EEG,"" versus only 21.4% of ""follow-up EEG."" The average voltage went from 12.33 ± 5.09 µV in the acute EEGs to 32.8 ± 20.13 µV in the follow-up EEGs. A total of 60% of acute EEGs showed an intermittent focal rhythmic. We have not found a statistically significant association between voltage of acute EEG and nonneurological clinical status (including respiratory) that may interfere with the EEG findings. Conclusions. Nonspecific diffuse slowing EEG pattern in COVID-19 is the most common finding reported, but we found in addition to that, as a distinctive finding, low voltage EEG, that could explain the low prevalence of epileptic activity published in these patients. A metabolic/hypoxic mechanism seems unlikely on the basis of our EEG findings. This pattern in other etiologies is reminiscent of severe encephalopathy states associated with poor prognosis. However, an unreactive low voltage pattern in COVID-19 patients is not necessarily related to poor prognosis.","Sáez-Landete, Isabel; Gómez-Domínguez, Adriana; Estrella-León, Beatriz; Díaz-Cid, Alba; Fedirchyk, Olga; Escribano-Muñoz, Marta; Pedrera-Mazarro, Antonio; Martín-Palomeque, Guillermo; Garcia-Ribas, Guillermo; Rodríguez-Jorge, Fernando; Santos-Pérez, Gloria; Lourido-García, Daniel; Regidor-BaillyBailliere, Ignacio",Clinical EEG and neuroscience,3,1

The purpose of this study was to examine changes in vaccine intentions and attitudes by sociodemographic characteristics and geographic areas, factors associated with vaccination intent, and reasons for non-vaccination among a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults. METHODS: Data from six waves of the Household Pulse Survey (6 January – 29 March 2021) were analyzed. Differences between January and March were assessed using t-tests. Factors associated with vaccination intent were examined in multivariable logistic regression models. RESULTS: From early January to late March, vaccination receipt of ≥1 dose of the COVID-19 vaccine or intention to definitely get vaccinated increased from 54.7 to 72.3%; however, disparities in vaccination intent continued to exist by age group, race/ethnic groups, and socioeconomic characteristics. Vaccine receipt and the intent were the lowest for region 4 (southeastern U.S.) throughout this period. Adults who had a previous COVID-19 diagnosis or were unsure if they have had COVID-19 were less likely to intend to get vaccinated [prevalence ratio = 0.92 (95%CI: 0.90–0.93) and 0.80 (95%CI: 0.74–0.85), respectively]. The belief that a vaccine is not needed increased by more than five percentage points from early January to late March. CONCLUSION: Intent to definitely get a COVID-19 vaccine increased by almost 18 percentage points from early January to late March; however, younger adults, adults who are non-Hispanic Black or other races, adults of lower socioeconomic status, and adults living in the southeastern U.S. region (Region 4) continue to have higher coverage gaps and levels of vaccine hesitancy. Emphasizing the importance of vaccination among all populations, and removing barriers to vaccines, may lead to a reduction of COVID-19 incidence and bring an end to the pandemic. KEY MESSAGES: Receipt of ≥1 dose of the COVID-19 vaccine and intent to probably or definitely get vaccinated increased from early January to late March; however, disparities in vaccine intent continued to exist by age group, race/ethnic groups, and socioeconomic characteristics. Vaccine receipt and the intent were the lowest for region 4 (southeastern U.S.) compared to other regions during this period. Adults who had a previous COVID-19 diagnosis or were unsure if they have had COVID-19 were less likely to intend to get vaccinated; overall, the belief that a vaccine is not needed to be increased by more than 5% points from early January to late March.

They have been infected at an elevated rate compared to the general public. HCWs have argued for better protections with minimal success. A worldwide shortage of N95s and comparable respirators appears to have influenced guidelines for protection, which stand at odds with increasing scientific evidence. In-depth interviews were conducted with ten frontline HCWs about their concerns. They reported that the risk of contracting COVID-19 and infecting family members has created intense anxiety. This, in conjunction with understaffing and an increased workload, has resulted in exhaustion and burnout. HCWs feel abandoned by their governments, which failed to prepare for an inevitable epidemic, despite recommendations. The knowledge that they are at increased risk of infection due to lack of protection has resulted in anger, frustration, fear, and a sense of violation that may have long-lasting implications.

Levels of support significantly varied by race, gender, and age. There was significantly more support for using certain mechanisms in response to the trafficking of serious drugs, which was fully mediated by participants’ views on the importance of the cost of incarceration.

The current inability to replicate EEDV in vitro necessitates the search for a reproducible, sensitive, and specific assay that allows for its detection and quantitation in a time- and cost-effective manner. Herein, we describe a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay that was developed for the quantitative detection of EEDV in infected fish tissues. The newly developed LAMP reaction was optimized in the presence of calcein, and the best results were produced using 2 mM MgCl(2), 1.8 mM dNTPs and at an incubation temperature of 67.1 °C. This method was highly specific to EEDV, as it showed no cross-reactivity with several fish viruses, including Salmonid Herpesvirus(-1), -2, -4, and -5, Infectious Pancreatic Necrosis Virus, Spring Viremia of Carp Virus, Infectious Hematopoietic Necrosis Virus, Golden Shiner Reovirus, Fathead Minnow Nidovirus, and Viral Hemorrhagic Septicemia Virus. The analytical sensitivity of the EEDV-LAMP method was estimated to be as low as 16 copies of plasmid per reaction. When infected fish tissue was used, a positive reaction could be obtained when an infected gill tissue sample that contained 430 viral copies/μg was diluted up to five orders of magnitude. The sensitivity and specificity of the newly developed LAMP assay compared to the SYBR Green qPCR assay were 84.3% and 93.3%, respectively. The quantitative LAMP for EEDV had a correlation coefficient (R(2) = 0.980), and did not differ significantly from the SYBR Green quantitative PCR assay (p > 0.05). Given its cost- and time-effectiveness, this quantitative LAMP assay is suitable for screening lake trout populations and for the initial diagnosis of clinical cases.","Zhang, Qingli; Shavalier, Megan; Standish, Isaac; Glenney, Gavin W.; Loch, Thomas P.; Faisal, Mohamed",J Virol Methods,3,1

The protease inhibitor camostat mesylate inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection of lung cells by blocking the virus-activating host cell protease TMPRSS2. Camostat mesylate has been approved for treatment of pancreatitis in Japan and is currently being repurposed for COVID-19 treatment. However, potential mechanisms of viral resistance as well as camostat mesylate metabolization and antiviral activity of metabolites are unclear. Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 can employ TMPRSS2-related host cell proteases for activation and that several of them are expressed in viral target cells. However, entry mediated by these proteases was blocked by camostat mesylate. The camostat metabolite GBPA inhibited the activity of recombinant TMPRSS2 with reduced efficiency as compared to camostat mesylate and was rapidly generated in the presence of serum. Importantly, the infection experiments in which camostat mesylate was identified as a SARS-CoV-2 inhibitor involved preincubation of target cells with camostat mesylate in the presence of serum for 2 h and thus allowed conversion of camostat mesylate into GBPA. Indeed, when the antiviral activities of GBPA and camostat mesylate were compared in this setting, no major differences were identified. Our results indicate that use of TMPRSS2-related proteases for entry into target cells will not render SARS-CoV-2 camostat mesylate resistant. Moreover, the present and previous findings suggest that the peak concentrations of GBPA established after the clinically approved camostat mesylate dose (600 mg/day) will result in antiviral activity.","Hoffmann, Markus; Hofmann-Winkler, Heike; Smith, Joan C.; Krüger, Nadine; Sørensen, Lambert K.; Søgaard, Ole S.; Hasselstrøm, Jørgen Bo; Winkler, Michael; Hempel, Tim; Raich, Lluís; Olsson, Simon; Yamazoe, Takashi; Yamatsuta, Katsura; Mizuno, Hirotaka; Ludwig, Stephan; Noé, Frank; Sheltzer, Jason M.; Kjolby, Mads; Pöhlmann, Stefan",bioRxiv,3,28

We identify four key areas of attention in the process of developing digital tools for collecting sensitive VGI: i) participant motivation ii) data management and public research communication iii) accessibility iv) handling of geographic information and v) partnership with existing stakeholders. These factors are critical in the process of working with sensitive geographic data in an ethical fashion and ensuring maximum data reliability.

It is vegetatively propagated and requires a high proportion of rhizomes as starting planting materials. Besides, ginger vegetative propagation using its rhizomes is accompanied by several types of soil-borne diseases. Plant tissue culture techniques have been applied in many plant species to produce their disease-free planting materials. As ‘Bentong’ ginger is less known for its micropropagation, this study was conducted to investigate the effects of Clorox (5.25% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl)) on explant surface sterilization, effects of plant growth regulators, and basal media on shoots’ multiplication and rooting. The secondary metabolites and antioxidant activities of the micropropagated plants were evaluated in comparison with conventionally propagated plants. Rhizome sprouted buds were effectively sterilized in 70% Clorox for 30 min by obtaining 75% contamination-free explants. Murashige and Skoog (MS) supplemented with 10 µM of zeatin was the suitable medium for shoot multiplication, which resulted in the highest number of shoots per explant (4.28). MS medium supplemented with 7.5 µM 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) resulted in the highest number of roots per plantlet. The in vitro-rooted plantlets were successfully acclimatized with a 95% survival rate in the ex vitro conditions. The phytochemical analysis showed that total phenolic acid and total flavonoid content and antioxidant activities of the micropropagated plants were not significantly different from the conventionally propagated plants of ‘Bentong’ ginger.

The aim herein is to examine outcomes in COVID-19 patients with and without HF. Methods Patients (n = 437) consecutively admitted with COVID-19 were categorized according to the presence vs. absence of HF and subcategorized according to HFpEF and HFrEF (EF <50%). The primary outcome was inpatient mortality with independent correlates were identified with logistic regression. Secondary outcomes included acute kidney injury (AKI), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and need for mechanical ventilation. Results The median cohort patient age was 68 (56-76) years, 43% (n = 189) were female, and 41% (n = 179) were Caucasian. HF was present in 29.7% (n = 130) of patients of which 43.8% (n = 57) had HFrEF and 56.2% (N = 73) had HFpEF. Patients with HF were more likely to be of older age and have more comorbidities. Overall inpatient mortality in the cohort was 12.3%. Compared to patients without HF (7.6%), patients with HFpEF (39.1%) and HFrEF (23.5%) had higher inpatient mortality (p<0.05) and were more likely to develop AKI, require mechanical ventilation, and have worse ARDS (figure 1). ACE/ARB and/or hydroxychloroquine were not associated with mortality (p >0.05) and there were no differences in inflammatory markers (ferritin, D-dimer, CRP, LDH). Independent predictors of inpatient mortality included: HFpEF (adjOR 2.55 (1.37-4.76)), age > 65 years (adjOR 3.00 (1.66-5.43), African American race (adjOR 1.82 (1.00-3.30)), Other race (adjOR 2.34 (1.02-5.37), p = 0.043), cerebrovascular disease (adjOR 3.07 (1.54-6.10), p = 0.001), and chronic hypoxic respiratory failure [adjOR 3.02 (1.19-7.62], p = 0.019)], whereas HFrEF was not (adjOR 1.58 (0.77-3.23). Discussion HF is prevalent in patients admitted with COVID-19. Patients with HFpEF had 2.6-fold higher mortality than those without HF and greater burdens of inpatient complications. Patients with HFpEF with COVID19 may warrant closer outpatient monitoring and a lower threshold for admission.","Raad, Mohamad; Gorgis, Sarah; Dabbagh, Mohammed; Parikh, Sachin; Cowger, Jennifer",Journal of Cardiac Failure,3,13

Many countries are vaccinating or considering vaccinating pregnant women with limited available data about the safety of this strategy. Early identification of safety concerns of COVID-19 vaccines, including their components, or their technological platforms is therefore urgently needed. METHODS: We conducted a rapid systematic review, as the first phase of an ongoing full systematic review, to evaluate the safety of COVID-19 vaccines in pregnant women, including their components, and their technological platforms (whole virus, protein, viral vector or nucleic acid) used in other vaccines, following the Cochrane methods and the PRISMA statement for reporting (PROSPERO-CRD42021234185). We searched literature databases, COVID-19 and pregnancy registries from inception February 2021 without time or language restriction and explored the reference lists of relevant systematic reviews retrieved. We selected studies of any methodological design that included at least 50 pregnant women or pregnant animals exposed to the vaccines that were selected for review by the COVAX MIWG in August 2020 or their components or platforms included in the COVID-19 vaccines, and evaluated adverse events during pregnancy and the neonatal period. Pairs of reviewers independently selected studies through the COVIDENCE web software and performed the data extraction through a previously piloted online extraction form. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus. RESULTS: We identified 6768 records, 256 potentially eligible studies were assessed by full-text, and 37 clinical and non-clinical studies (38 reports, involving 2,397,715 pregnant women and 56 pregnant animals) and 12 pregnancy registries were included. Most studies (89%) were conducted in high-income countries. The most frequent study design was cohort studies (n=21), followed by surveillance studies, randomized controlled trials, and registry analyses. Most studies (76%) allowed comparisons between vaccinated and unvaccinated pregnant women (n=25) or animals (n=3) and reported exposures during the three trimesters of pregnancy. The most frequent exposure was to AS03 adjuvant in the context of A/H1N1 pandemic influenza vaccines (n=24), followed by aluminum-based adjuvants (n=11). Aluminum phosphate was used in Respiratory Syncytial Virus Fusion candidate vaccines (n=3) and Tdap vaccines (n=3). Different aluminum-based adjuvants were used in hepatitis vaccines. The replication-deficient simian adenovirus ChAdOx1 was used for a Rift Valley fever vaccine. Only one study reported exposure to messenger RNA (mRNA) COVID-19 vaccines that also used lipid nanoparticles. Except for one preliminary report about A/H1N1 influenza vaccination (adjuvant AS03) - corrected by the authors in a more thorough analysis, all studies concluded that there were no safety concerns. CONCLUSION: This rapid review found no evidence of pregnancy-associated safety concerns of COVID-19 vaccines that were selected for review by the COVAX MIWG or of their components or platforms when used in other vaccines. However, the need for further data on several vaccine platforms and components is warranted given their novelty. Our findings support current WHO guidelines recommending that pregnant women may consider receiving COVID-19 vaccines, particularly if they are at high risk of exposure or have comorbidities that enhance the risk of severe disease.","Ciapponi, Agustín; Bardach, Ariel; Mazzoni, Agustina; Alconada, Tomás; Anderson, Steven; Argento, Fernando J.; Ballivian, Jamile; Bok, Karin; Comandé, Daniel; Erbelding, Emily; Goucher, Erin; Kampmann, Beate; Karron, Ruth; Munoz, Flor M.; Palermo, María Carolina; Parker, Edward P.

With this in mind, this study examines Taiwan's response to COVID-19 because it was successful in spite of a high probability of contagion. The paper first explores the assertion that cognition, communication, collaboration, and control are vital for effective disaster response; it then indicates the need to consider two additional Cs: confidence (trust of government's competency) and coproduction (public participation in disaster transmission prevention). The paper also conducts a qualitative descriptive study of the Taiwan government's response timeline with examples of each of these concepts in action. To further illustrate the need for the two additional Cs, survey data illustrate how public confidence serves as a pivot between government's COVID-19 response and citizen coproduction in COVID-19 transmission prevention.","Liu, Li-Yin; Wu, Wei-Ning; McEntire, David A.",Int J Disaster Risk Reduct,3,3

Diabetes seems to be one of the main comorbidities contributing to a worse COVID-19 outcome. OBJECTIVE: In here we analyze the clinical characteristics and outcomes of diabetic COVID-19 patients Kuwait. METHODS: In this single-center, retrospective study of 417 consecutive COVID-19 patients, we analyze and compare disease severity, outcome, associated complications, and clinical laboratory findings between diabetic and non-diabetic COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: COVID-19 patients with diabetes had more ICU admission than non-diabetic COVID-19 patients (20.1% vs. 16.8%, p < 0.001). Diabetic COVID-19 patients also recorded higher mortality in comparison to non-diabetic COVID-19 patients (16.7% vs. 12.1%, p < 0.001). Diabetic COVID-19 patients had significantly higher prevalence of comorbidities, such as hypertension. Laboratory investigations also highlighted notably higher levels of C-reactive protein in diabetic COVID019 patients and lower estimated glomerular filtration rate. They also showed a higher incidence of complications. logistic regression analysis showed that every 1 mmol/L increase in fasting blood glucose in COVID-19 patients is associated with 1.52 (95% CI: 1.34–1.72, p < 0.001) times the odds of dying from COVID-19.

Objective To assess the risk of RTIs and non-infectious ILD with these drugs. Methods We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Risk of RTIs and non-infectious ILD was compared to placebo by Mantel-Haenszel (MH) risk difference (RD). We divided RTIs into upper RTIs (URTI), viral URTIs, and lower RTIs (LRTIs) including infectious pneumonia. Non-infectious ILD included ILD, eosinophilic pneumonia, and pneumonitis. Results We identified 54 RCTs including 10,907 patients with six IL-12/23 or IL-23 antagonists and 5,175 patients with placebo. These drugs significantly increased the risk of RTIs (MH RD 0.019, 95% confidence interval 0.005-0.033, P = 0.007) which was attributed to URTIs, but not viral URTIs or LRTIs. There was no significant difference in infectious pneumonia and non-infectious ILD between two groups. Limitations Due to the rarity of infectious pneumonia and ILD, sensitivity analysis was required. Conclusion The use of IL-12/23 or IL-23 antagonists for autoimmune diseases increased the risk of URTIs, but not viral URTIs, LRTIs, and non-infectious ILD.","Akiyama, Shintaro; Yamada, Akihiro; Micic, Dejan; Sakuraba, Atsushi",J Am Acad Dermatol,3,22

METHODS: This study was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Four databases and conference proceedings were searched between January 1, 1980, and May 1, 2020. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using the Standards for reporting qualitative research checklist. RESULTS: Our search identified 240 citations and 52 studies met the inclusion criteria. The major expectations of the patients are symptomatic and pain control, quality of life and normal endoscopy. Patients main concerns are access to information and healthcare, and shared decision making. At the time of diagnosis, patients expressed a greater need for knowledge about their IBD, preferentially by their treating gastroenterologist. The main treatment expectations in active disease are efficacy, safety and convenience. Patients are willing to accept relatively high risks of complications from medical therapy to avoid a permanent ostomy and to achieve durable remission. Patients are more interested in disease monitoring, research and development during the time of remission. Telemedicine and self-management with supervised e-health tools are feasible and acceptable amongst patients with IBD. CONCLUSION: This systematic review demonstrates that patients with IBD expect more information about their disease process, shared decision making and symptom control. Further research is needed to help align patient and physician expectations in order to improve the quality of care provided to patients with IBD.

Many of the flaviviruses that are pathogenic in humans are transmitted specifically through mosquito vectors. Over the past century, many mosquito-borne flavivirus infections have emerged and re-emerged, and are of global importance with hundreds of millions of infections occurring yearly. There is a need for novel, effective, and accessible vaccines and antivirals capable of inhibiting flavivirus infection and ameliorating disease. The development of therapeutics targeting viral entry has long been a goal of antiviral research, but most efforts are hindered by the lack of broad-spectrum potency or toxicities associated with on-target effects, since many host proteins necessary for viral entry are also essential for host cell biology. Mosquito-borne flaviviruses generally enter cells by clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME), and recent studies suggest that a subset of these viruses can be internalized through a specialized form of CME that has additional dependencies distinct from canonical CME pathways, and antivirals targeting this pathway have been discovered. In this review, we discuss the role and contribution of endocytosis to mosquito-borne flavivirus entry as well as consider past and future efforts to target endocytosis for therapeutic interventions.","Carro, Stephen D.; Cherry, Sara",Viruses,3,13

Transient atrioventricular (AV) block is a relatively common complication of inferior STEMI and its management is also addressed in the guidelines. CASE SUMMARY: A 64-year-old gentleman with multiple cardiovascular risk factors presented to the emergency department with a history of ischaemic type chest pain and evidence of inferior ST-segment elevation on his electrocardiogram (ECG). First-degree AV block was noted on his initial ECG. He was given thrombolytic therapy as part of a pharmacoinvasive strategy of reperfusion. He, however, failed fibrinolytic therapy, and emergency angiography revealed critical disease of the right coronary artery which was successfully stented. Subsequent to reperfusion, he developed complete AV block without evidence of re-infarction, which was managed conservatively with successful resolution of the block after 7 days of expectant management with temporary transvenous pacing. DISCUSSION: We highlight some of the important management principles from the ESC guideline of STEMI including timing and the management of AV block in these patients. In addition, we highlight the role of a pharmacoinvasive strategy for reperfusion where timeous primary percutaneous coronary intervention cannot be performed.

Depending on its evolutionary trajectory, the virus is expected to establish itself as an endemic infectious respiratory disease exhibiting seasonal flare-ups. Therefore, despite the unprecedented rally to reach a vaccine that can offer widespread immunization, it is equally important to reach effective prevention and treatment regimens for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Contributing to this effort, we have curated and analyzed multi-source and multi-omics publicly available data from patients, cell lines and databases in order to fuel a multiplex computational drug repurposing approach. We devised a network-based integration of multi-omic data to prioritize the most important genes related to COVID-19 and subsequently re-rank the identified candidate drugs. Our approach resulted in a highly informed integrated drug shortlist by combining structural diversity filtering along with experts’ curation and drug–target mapping on the depicted molecular pathways. In addition to the recently proposed drugs that are already generating promising results such as dexamethasone and remdesivir, our list includes inhibitors of Src tyrosine kinase (bosutinib, dasatinib, cytarabine and saracatinib), which appear to be involved in multiple COVID-19 pathophysiological mechanisms. In addition, we highlight specific immunomodulators and anti-inflammatory drugs like dactolisib and methotrexate and inhibitors of histone deacetylase like hydroquinone and vorinostat with potential beneficial effects in their mechanisms of action.

The aims of this study were to assess whether HBP is involved in the pathophysiology of COVID-19 and, if so, whether it can be used to predict severe disease preferably using a point-of-care test. METHODS: This was a prospective convenience sample study of biomarkers in patients admitted to Skåne University hospital in Sweden with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis. Plasma samples and clinical data were collected within 72h after admission, during hospital stay and at discharge. Plasma HBP concentrations samples were measured both with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and with a novel dry immunofluorescence analyzer (Joinstar) point-of-care test. RESULTS: Thirty-five COVID-19 patients were enrolled in the study. Twenty-nine patients had blood samples taken within 72h after admission. We compared the highest HBP value taken within 72h after admission in patients who eventually developed organ dysfunction (n = 23) compared to those who did not (n = 6), and found that HBP was significantly elevated in those who developed organ dysfunction (25.0 ng/mL (interquartile range (IQR) 16.6–48.5) vs 10.6 ng/mL (IQR 4.8–21.7 ng/mL), p = 0.03). Point-of-care test measurements correlated well with ELISA measurements (R = 0.83). HBP measured by the POC device predicted development of COVID-induced organ dysfunction with an AUC of 0.88 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.70–1.0). CONCLUSIONS: HBP is elevated prior to onset of organ dysfunction in patients with severe COVID-19 using a newly developed point-of-care test and hence HBP could be used in a clinical setting as a prognostic marker in COVID-19.","Mellhammar, Lisa; Thelaus, Louise; Elén, Sixten; Fisher, Jane; Linder, Adam",PLoS One,3,9

Few interventions focus on preventing perinatal depression. Previous studies suggest that Mothers and Babies is efficacious in preventing the worsening of depressive symptoms and the onset of postpartum depression. This manuscript presents the protocol of the EPIC study (Effects of a Prenatal Depression Preventive Intervention on parenting and young children’s Self-Regulation and Functioning) to test the effects of Mothers and Babies on parenting and child developmental outcomes through 54 months postpartum. EPIC is an observational study that builds on a completed cluster-randomized trial (CRT). Innovations of this study are direct observations of a subsample of mother-child dyads and the inclusion of fathers/caregivers’ variables as moderators of maternal mental health. METHODS: For this study, we plan to enroll 738 women with children under 30 months old, ≥18 years old, and who speak English or Spanish. Additionally, 429 fathers, partners, or other adult caregivers will be recruited through women participating in the study. Women will be recruited through the parent study (intervention and control participants) or through one of 10 home visiting programs in Illinois (control participants). Data collection will take place through maternal self-report at five time points (when the child is 30, 36, 42, 48, and 54 months), paternal self-report at three time points (when the child is 30, 42, and 54 months), and through mother-child observations at three time points (when the child is 36, 42, and 48 months). Outcome domains include maternal mental health, cognitive-behavioral and parenting skills, and child self-regulation and functioning. Moderators include the contributions of fathers/caregivers, race-ethnicity, and socioeconomic disadvantage.

The porcine intestinal epithelium is the target of TGEV infection, but the mechanisms that TGEV disrupts the actin cytoskeleton and invades the host epithelium remain largely unknown. We not only found that TGEV infection stimulates F-actin to gather at the cell membrane but the disruption of F-actin inhibits TGEV entry as well. Cofilin is involved in F-actin reorganization and TGEV entry. The TGEV spike protein is capable of binding with EGFR, activating the downstream phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K), then causing the phosphorylation of cofilin and F-actin polymerization via Rac1/Cdc42 GTPases. Inhibition of EGFR and PI3K decreases the entry of TGEV. EGFR is also the upstream activator of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways that is involved in F-actin reorganization. Additionally, lipid rafts act as signal platforms for the EGFR-associated signaling cascade and correlate with the adhesion of TGEV. In conlusion, these results provide valuable data of the mechanisms which are responsible for the TGEV pathogenesis and may lead to the development of new methods about controlling TGEV.","Hu, Weiwei; Zhu, Liqi; Yang, Xing; Lin, Jian; Yang, Qian",Oncotarget,3,21

The current pandemic has also resulted in a transformation in medical education for both undergraduate and postgraduate medical students. Clinical rotations for undergraduates have been suspended all over the world; inter-hospital residency rotations and combined teaching sessions have also been curtailed until further notice. During this most recent pandemic, a number of medical schools have immediately converted their whole clinical curriculum into online formats. Similarly, educational and clinical assessments have been converted into online assessments.

The effectiveness of such a method depends on how strictly it is applied and the timing of its implementation. An early start and being strict is very effective; however, at the same time, it impacts freedom and economic opportunity. Here we created a simulation model to understand the effect of the starting day of community containment on the ﬁnal outcome, that is, the number of those infected, hospitalized and those that died, as we followed the dynamics of COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We used a stochastic recursive simulation method to apply disease outbreak dynamics measures of COVID-19 as an example to simulate disease spread. Parameters are allowed to be randomly assigned between higher and lower values obtained from published COVID-19 literature. Results: We simulated the dynamics of COVID-19 spread, calculated the number of active infections, hospitalizations and deaths as the outcome of our simulation and compared these results with real world data. We also represented the details of the spread in a network graph structure, and shared the code for the simulation model to be used for examining other variables. Conclusions: Early implementation of community containment has a big impact on the ﬁnal outcome of an outbreak.","Mohsen, Attayeb; Alarabi, Ahmed",F1000Res,3,26

Astragaloside IV is considered as an anti-inflammatory and antioxidant agent. This study aimed at undertaking a network pharmacology approach and bioinformatics analysis to uncover the pharmacological mechanisms of Astragaloside IV on COVID-19. METHODS: Potential targets of Astragaloside IV were screened from public databases. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in SARS-CoV-2 were screened using bioinformatics analysis on the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets GSE147507. Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses were subsequently performed. The overlapping genes, GO terms and KEGG pathways between Astragaloside IV targets and SARS-CoV-2 DEGs were confirmed, and the location of overlapping targets in the key pathways was queried using KEGG Mapper. RESULTS: A total of 425 potential targets of Astragaloside IV were screened. Besides, a total of 546 DEGs were identified between SARS-CoV-2 infected samples and control samples, including 380 up-regulated and 166 down-regulated genes. There was a significant overlap in GO terms and KEGG pathways between Astragaloside IV targets and SARS-CoV-2 DEGs. The shared genes included MMP13, NLRP3, TRIM21, GBP1, ADORA2A, PTAFR, TNF, MLNR, IL1B, NFKBIA, ADRB2, and IL6. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to propose Astragaloside IV as a new drug candidate for alleviating hyper-inflammation in COVID-19 patients. Besides, the key targets and pathways may reveal the main pharmacological mechanism of Astragaloside IV in the treatment of COVID-19.","Ge, Chenliang; He, Yan",Front Pharmacol,3,1

Recommendations have been published to manage patients needing surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic. This survey, under the aegis of the Italian Society of Endoscopic Surgery, aims to analyze how Italian surgeons have changed their practice during the pandemic. METHODS: The authors designed an online survey that was circulated for completion to the Italian departments of general surgery registered in the Italian Ministry of Health database in December 2020. Questions were divided into three sections: hospital organization, screening policies, and safety profile of the surgical operation. The investigation periods were divided into the Italian pandemic phases I (March–May 2020), II (June–September 2020), and III (October–December 2020). RESULTS: Of 447 invited departments, 226 answered the survey. Most hospitals were treating both COVID-19-positive and -negative patients. The reduction in effective beds dedicated to surgical activity was significant, affecting 59% of the responding units. 12.4% of the respondents in phase I, 2.6% in phase II, and 7.7% in phase III reported that their surgical unit had been closed. 51.4%, 23.5%, and 47.8% of the respondents had at least one colleague reassigned to non-surgical COVID-19 activities during the three phases. There has been a reduction in elective (> 200 procedures: 2.1%, 20.6% and 9.9% in the three phases, respectively) and emergency (< 20 procedures: 43.3%, 27.1%, 36.5% in the three phases, respectively) surgical activity. The use of laparoscopy also had a setback in phase I (25.8% performed less than 20% of elective procedures through laparoscopy). 60.6% of the respondents used a smoke evacuation device during laparoscopy in phase I, 61.6% in phase II, and 64.2% in phase III. Almost all responders (82.8% vs. 93.2% vs. 92.7%) in each analyzed period did not modify or reduce the use of high-energy devices. CONCLUSION: This survey offers three faithful snapshots of how the surgical community has reacted to the COVID-19 pandemic during its three phases. The significant reduction in surgical activity indicates that better health policies and more evidence-based guidelines are needed to make up for lost time and surgery not performed during the pandemic.

A structural equation modeling and metric invariance test were used as the data analysis technique. Our results revealed that the protective measures against the COVID-19 virus significantly and positively influenced customer safety during shopping, the attitudes and satisfaction, which contribute to an increase of their behavioral intentions as a result. The mediating role of attitudes and safety was also uncovered. In addition, our findings from the metric invariance test indicated that gender, age, education, and income significantly moderated the relationships among the studied constructs. Our results can help retail practitioners and researchers develop a strategy to effectively implement protective measures against COVID-19 in the retail enterprises.","Untaru, Elena-Nicoleta; Han, Heesup",Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services,3,16

This paper shows the case of the reeruption of maxillary incisors accompanied by complicated crown fractures after 3 months. An 8-year-old boy patient was referred to the Department of Pedodontic Dentistry of Tehran University of Medical Science, Tehran, Iran, 18 hours after a fall at school. Clinical and radiographic examinations revealed intrusive luxation of both incisors with complicated crown fractures. Cervical pulpotomy is the treatment of choice for traumatized immature intruded teeth with pulp exposure. Two months later, the right central incisor teeth reerupted to a normal position and the final aesthetic restorations were done. The left central incisor was spontaneously repositioned with external root resorption, and the team decided to use interim medication (calcium hydroxide) in the root canal for stopping the process of resorption, and by the 9-month follow-up, the process of resorption had been stopped. An MTA plug was placed into the canal, and the final esthetic restorations were done.","Abazarian, Niusha; Milani, Shabnam; Hamrah, Moahammad Hassan; Shahrabi, Marzieh Salehi",Case Rep Dent,3,1

The studies on 2019 Corona Virus Disease-19 (COVID-19) conducted from various fields around the world. Herein, the objective of the present study is to summarize the etiology, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, image findings, traceability analysis, and drug development of COVID-19. METHODS: The following electronic databases were searched: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, VIP Chinese Science and Technology Periodical Database, and Wanfang Data. Other relevant literature will be manually searched as a compliment. We have reviewed etiology, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, image findings, and medication from case reports and retrospective clinical studies relating to COVID-19 published since the outbreak. RESULTS: The coronavirus is closely related to bat coronavirus and pangolin coronavirus. Besides, the infection pathway is confirmed to be the respiratory and digestive systems. The virus indicates person-to-person transmission and some patients present asymptomatic. The elderly have a higher mortality rate. Rapid and sensitive nucleic acid testing is usually used as a basis for diagnosis. Currently, there is no specific vaccine and antiviral drug. Intervention actions such as travel bans and quarantine adopted have effectively reduced the spread of the epidemic. CONCLUSION: This systemic review will provide high-quality evidence to summarize etiology, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, image findings, traceability analysis, drug development in patients with COVID-19.","Xu, Jia; Ma, Xue-Ping; Bai, Long; Wang, Miao; Deng, Wu; Ning, Ning",Medicine (Baltimore),3,16
